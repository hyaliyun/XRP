In 2017/2018, the organisation reached over 1000 pupils in seven countries and engaged hundreds of scientists. Activities Native Scientist conducts different types of projects related to science outreach and multilingualism. Since it was founded, it runs the project \\"Native Schools\\", which joins international scientists and migrant pupils in schools to speak about science in their native language. Initially operating only in the UK for Portuguese-speaking communities, the project has now expanded to other international communities inside the UK and to other European countries, including France, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Ireland and the Netherlands. More recently, this has expanded to include events for migrant children in museums and laboratories. The organization has also launched scientific podcasts for children, school educational resources authored by scientists, and a collection of interviews about the benefits and challenges of being multilingual. Partnerships As of 2018, the organisation was formally associated with more than 30 other European institutions, including other scientific and international associations, language institutes and universities.

Early life Stevens was born on January 5, 1836 in New York City. He was the son of banker Byam Kerby Stevens (1792‚Äì1870) and Frances (n√©e Gallatin) Stevens (1803‚Äì1877). His father inherited Stevens House, the historic home of his grandfather, Maj. Gen. Ebenezer Stevens. His older brother was fellow banker Alexander Henry Stevens. His paternal grandfather was Albert Gallatin, the 4th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury who served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom and France. His maternal grandparents were Major General Ebenezer Stevens and Lucretia (n√©e Ledyard) Sands Stevens. From his grandmother's first marriage to Richardson Sands (younger brother of Joshua and Comfort Sands), she was the grandmother of fellow banker Samuel Stevens Sands. Among his many prominent relatives were uncles John Austin Stevens, a banker with his father, and Alexander Hodgdon Stevens, a surgeon. Among his first cousins were John Austin Stevens, founder of the Sons of the Revolution, and Lucretia Stevens (n√©e Rhinelander) Jones, the mother of author Edith Wharton. Career Stevens started working in the merchant business importing sugar from Cuba to New York. He later became a member of the Gold Board of New York, formed shortly after the beginning of the American Civil War, the forerunner to the New York Stock Exchange, where he was an active figure holding a seat until his retirement from the exchange in 1883. After 1883, he invested his wealth in real estate, particularly with buildings downtown. He also served as an editor of Town Topics and the Saturday Evening Post for a time. =Society life= In 1892, both Stevens and his wife (and her brother Matthew Astor Wilks) were both included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Stevens was a member of the Metropolitan Club, the Union Club of the City of New York, the Knickerbocker Club and the Metropolitan Club in Washington, D.C. Personal life Stevens was married to Elizabeth Langdon Wilks (‚Äì1930), who went by Eliza. She was the sister of Matthew Astor Wilks and, through her mother, the great-granddaughter of America's first millionaire John Jacob Astor. Among her first cousins were DeLancey Astor Kane, Woodbury Kane, S. Nicholson Kane, and John Jacob Astor IV. Her father, Matthew Wilks, was born in London and was the son of a reverend. In 1908, Stevens purchased property at 11 East 78th Street, not far from the Stuyvesant Fish mansion at the corner of 78th and Madison Avenue. They built a four-story Italian Renaissance townhouse that was completed in 1909. Around 1900, they also purchased a villa, known as \\"Sunnyhome\\", in Lenox, Massachusetts. The Italianate style residence was originally built and was purchased from Elizabeth Bennett. Stevens died at his home in New York on December 12, 1911. His funeral was held at Grace Church in Manhattan. His widow died in June 1930, leaving a net estate of $1,606,456, the majority of which was in securities and real estate.

She was a member of the committee which raised the first funds towards William Lloyd Garrison's The Liberator, a prominent antislavery newspaper. Afterwards, she was active in the Boston abolitionist community, helping to organize meetings and events.  Biography = Personal life = Riley was married to William Riley, the owner of a clothing store at 22 Brattle Street, which he had been operating since 1827. She also had two daughters, apparently from a previous marriage, named Sarah and Ann Jackson. With William she had three more children: William Jr., George, and Eliza Riley. Her husband died in 1849 and left most of his estate to her. = Activism = Though she was apparently unable to write, Riley was active in the abolitionist community that surrounded The Liberator, being a member of the Afric-American Female Intelligence Society, and the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. Riley was once accused of spending $2000 of her husband's money as donations to the local church, leaving their family impoverished and starving. Mrs. Riley and her husband subsequently refuted this rumor in the newspaper, noting that they had contributed only modestly, and stating that while they sometimes experienced financial difficulty, they were always able to get by. On his death, Mr. Riley willed additional funds to the building fund of the church. Riley was instrumental in the escape of fugitive slave Shadrach Minkins, whom she hid in the attic of her house on 70 Southac Street until he could be removed safely from Boston. Minkins was able to successfully escape to Canada as a result. This residence had been purchased by Mr. Riley in 1835, along with the adjacent house at 68 Southac, located centrally in the now-historic Beacon Hill area of Boston, home of the Massachusetts State House, and noted for its function as a hub of African- American and abolitionist organizing. These buildings were extremely nearby to the noted Lewis and Harriet Hayden House, which stands at 66 Southac (the street has since been renamed Phillips) ‚Äî a frequent haven used almost continually by the Underground Railroad. The adjoining no. 68 was occupied by a barber named Thomas Cole, another active member of the abolitionist community who endowed large sums of money to the cause. = Later life and death = After her husband's death, Riley continued to live in the same location that she had occupied with her husband. She remained involved in the local community, at one point holding a party at her house for the children of a nearby African-American Sunday school on Belknap Street. Riley died in 1855 at the age of 63. Her funeral was reportedly attended by a large number of mourners. Her obituary states that she had cared those ill and in need for \\"many years,\\" apparently spending much of her older years as a nurse.

After taking art classes at Washburn University at an early age, he honed his skills painting stage flats for high school theater productions. He studied painting and printmaking at Emporia State University with artist Richard Slimon, receiving BA and MA degrees in art, before attending Wichita State University and earning an MFA in 1972. Throughout his studies, Cook resisted the dominant minimalist and abstract art currents of the day, painting figurative and landscape works influenced by Cezanne, Monet, Albert Bierstadt, George Bellows, and Bay Area figuration.Leach, Dan. \\"Interview,\\" James Pringle Cook, The Painted Image: Recent Paintings, Topeka, KS: Mulvane Art Museum, 2013.Meyer-Munson Gallery.

In 1972, he took an Assistant Professor position at the University of Arizona, drawn to the region's geography, openness to representational work, and conduciveness to plein air (outdoor) painting. He taught painting, drawing and readings in contemporary art courses there for six years, before leaving to work full-time at painting; two years later, a successful exhibition at Frumkin/Struve Gallery in Chicago cemented his belief that he could make a living at art. In 1992, Cook won the prestigious Stonewall Show, a solo exhibition at the Tucson Museum of Art awarded annually to a regional artist.

Critics have observed that Cook's uncompromising artistic vision and approach place signature works, such as Whisper #2 (2013) or Morgan's Point (1995‚Äì6), in a breach between cutting edge and traditional, and abstraction and realism, that transcends labels and welcomes \\"art conservatives and iconoclasts alike.\\" As his work has evolved away from an early, tighter realism toward a more painterly approach incorporating the dimension of time and flux, this has been increasingly true.Yassin, Robert A. \\"Foreword,\\" Catalogue, Ketchum, ID: Gail Severn Gallery, 2001.Gealt, Barry.

Cook has stated, \\"the tension between the two poles [of realism and abstraction] has always been the thing that enlivens my work,\\" and that he feels most connected to \\"the painterly tradition, the language of the brush\\" and artists‚Äîrealist or abstract‚Äî\\"trying to make something exciting happen on the surface.\\" Cook's process generally begins with a visit to a location‚Äîfavorites include the Arizona mountains, the rolling hills of Kansas, and Idaho's Silver Creek Preserve‚Äîwhere he sketches plein air, usually in oil.Turner, Kevin. \\"The Rockies' grandeur in Cook's exhibition, Wickenburg Sun, October, 1991 After reviewing the sketches in the studio, he puts them aside to create drawings and studies based on his memory and experience of the place, which inspire large canvasses. In a nod to 19th- century tradition, he begins by laying out a grisaille‚Äîa black and white underpainting‚Äîthat blocks out the composition and establishes the structure within which he applies his furious paint handling and atmospheric effects. Nonetheless, Cook maintains that his work \\"is more choreographed than planned,\\" a view echoed by writers who describe his vigorous brushstrokes as \\"almost musical in their composition.\\" James Pringle Cook, Equinox #1 09, oil on linen, 42\\" x 70\\", 2011.

Up close, images such as Equinox 09 #1 (2011) or Whisper #2 break down into small strokes of color and complex, textural, almost sculptural surfaces; from afar they coalesce into recognizable, often realistic images whose power and energy matches the majestic, natural physicality being depicted.Buchholz, Barbara B. \\"Four in One,\\" Chicago Tribune, August 15, 1997. However, Cook is equally enthralled by man-made environments, as in works like Morgan's Point, which often seem to allude to both the power and awe of industry and the costs. Writers such as curator Stephen Vollmer note that, like Turner (and Monet), Cook is especially captivated by light and atmospheric effects, capturing the ephemerality of skies dissolving into billowing clouds, rushing water (e.g., Blue River CascadeJames Pringle Cook.

Known as \\"the father of China's nuclear submarines\\" and the \\"father of China's naval nuclear propulsion\\", he was the first chief designer of the country's nuclear submarine project, directing his team to build China's first generation of nuclear submarines (Type 091 and Type 092). He was also the main designer for China's first nuclear power plants, and is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. He served as vice minister for China's Sixth Ministry of Machine Building (Ministry of Shipbuilding Industry) and Ministry of Hydropower.  Biography  In 1933, Peng Shilu was jailed at the age of 8 for being the son of Peng Pai. The photo was taken by the Kuomintang authorities when he was arrested. Peng Shilu was born on November 18, 1925 in Haifeng County, Guangdong province, the son of Peng Pai, a top Chinese Communist revolutionary in the 1920s. His parents were killed by the Kuomintang government when he was less than 4 years old, and he was jailed at the age of 8 for being the son of Peng Pai. He was later rescued by his grandmother and sent to Yan'an by Zhou Enlai. In the 1940s he received his early training in Yan'an Institute of Natural Sciences (now Beijing Institute of Technology). After 1949, he went to the Soviet Union to complete advanced studies in nuclear science at Moscow Power Engineering Institute. When he returned to China, he was appointed to a senior post conducting research on the submarine nuclear reactor. In 1959, the Soviet Union refused to provide assistance for China's planned project of building nuclear-powered submarines, and Mao Zedong proclaimed that China would build its own nuclear submarines \\"even if it takes 10,000 years\\". Peng oversaw the entire nuclear submarine project and set about developing a workable nuclear power plant. In 1968, Peng proposed and led the building of a land-based prototype nuclear power reactor in Sichuan province for China's first nuclear submarine. This reactor was completed on April 1970 and successfully passed a test in July after Peng reported to the Central Special Commission led by Premier Zhou Enlai. In 1973, Peng was appointed vice president of China Ship Research and Design Institute (Wuhan-based 719 Research Institute, the Nuclear Submarine Institute), and afterwards became vice minister of the Sixth Ministry of Machine Building. China's first nuclear submarine (SSN), the Long March I of class 091, was commissioned in 1974,The Federation of American Scientists & The Natural Resources Defense Council Chinese Nuclear Forces and U.S. Nuclear War Planning p. 86 making China the fifth country to own a nuclear submarine after the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France. The first nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) of class 092 was completed and commissioned in 1981. Both type 091 and 092 submarines were equipped with the nuclear reactors and propulsion systems created by Peng and his team. In 1979, Peng was appointed the first chief designer of China's nuclear submarine project, while Huang Xuhua, Zhao Renkai (Ëµµ‰ªÅÊÅ∫), and Huang Weilu (ÈªÑÁ∫¨Á¶Ñ) were appointed as deputies. In 1983, Peng shifted from military to civilian application of nuclear power plants when he was appointed as vice minister for the Ministry of Hydropower, and was also appointed general engineer in the Ministry of Nuclear Industry. He led his team to build the Daya Bay and Qinshan Nuclear Power Plants.  Awards and honors  Peng received the National Science Conference Award in 1978, the top prize of the National Science and Technology Progress Awards in 1985, the Science and Technology Progress Award from Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation in 1996, and the Top Scientific Achievement Award from Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation in 2017. In 1988 he received the honorary title of \\"Outstanding Contribution to National Defense Science and Technology\\" from the Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.

A Republican, he is a member of the United States House of Representatives from . The district covers much of the southern third of the state and includes Rochester, Austin and Mankato. Early life and education Hagedorn was born in Blue Earth, Minnesota in 1962, the son of former United States Representative Tom Hagedorn and Kathleen Hagedorn (n√©e Mittlestadt). He was raised on his family's farm near Truman, Minnesota and in McLean, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., while his father served in Congress from 1975 to 1983. Hagedorn graduated from Langley High School. Hagedorn pled guilty to a DUI charge in Fairfax County, Virginia, in 1983. He graduated from George Mason University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government and political science in 1993. Politics=Government career= President Ronald Reagan in 1982 Hagedorn served as a legislative aide to Minnesota Congressman Arlan Stangeland, 1984-1991. He then worked in the United States Department of the Treasury as Director for Legislative and Public Affairs for the Financial Management Service from 1991 to 1998, and later as Congressional Affairs Officer for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing until 2009. =Mr. Conservative blog= Between 2002 and 2008, Hagedorn authored a now-deleted blog entitled Mr. Conservative. Blog posts included sexist comments, Islamophobic comments, complaints about Barack Obama, remarks against Native Americans, homophobic statements, and anti-Mormon and antisemitic comments. Hagedorn said the blog was intended to be humorous and satirical. Hagedorn's blogging history led the conservative Washington Examiner to run an editorial labeling him \\"the worst midterm candidate in America\\" in 2018. = U.S. House of Representatives =2010 election Hagedorn lost the Republican nomination for Minnesota's 1st congressional district in the 2010 election.  2014 election  Returning to Minnesota in 2013, he won the Republican nomination for Minnesota's 1st congressional district in 2014, but lost in the general election to Democratic incumbent Tim Walz.  2016 election  Hagedorn won the Republican nomination for Minnesota's 1st congressional district in the 2016 elections, but lost in the general election to Democratic incumbent Tim Walz.  2018 election  In the 2018 elections, Hagedorn received the Republican nomination, despite the National Rifle Association endorsing another candidate (Carla Nelson), who also received funds from Rep. Elise Stefanik, Richard Uihlein and Paul Singer. Hagedorn described himself as the most conservative candidate who is loyal to Trump. After Hagedorn won the 2018 primary, then-head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Representative Steve Stivers, said \\"that is news to me\\" about the viewpoints expressed on Hagedorn's blog. The spokeswoman for NRCC said the posts were inappropriate and were not condoned by the group. In the general election, with Walz giving up the seat to make a successful run for Governor of Minnesota, Hagedorn bested Democratic nominee Daniel Feehan.  2020 election  Hagedorn is running for re-election in 2020. =Tenure= According to the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University, Hagedorn held a Bipartisan Index Score of -0.0 in the 116th United States Congress for 2019, which placed him 190th out of 435 members. Based on FiveThirtyEight's congressional vote tracker at ABC News, Hagedorn voted with Donald Trump's stated public policy positions 94.4% of the time, which ranked him average in the 116th United States Congress when predictive scoring (district partisanship and voting record) is used. In 2020, in response to activist Shaun King saying that depictions of Jesus as white should be destroyed, Hagedorn wrote that the Democratic Party and Black Lives Matter movement \\"are at war with our country, our beliefs and western culture.\\" In response to critiques that the term \\"Western culture\\" has been used to promote white nationalism, Hagedorn said \\"The notion that statues and images of Jesus Christ somehow represent white supremacy and should be destroyed is ludicrous and represent a growing intolerant movement on the left to silence any voices that do not align with their radical secular views.\\" Hagedorn's comments led several corporate donors, including Intel and UnitedHealth Group, to ask for Hagedorn to return their donations. In 2020, Hagedorn's high volume of publicly funded constituent mail came under scrutiny. LegiStorm reported that Hagedorn spent more than one-fifth of his $1.4 million annual office budget on mailings.

Description Kuijt describes Psittacanthus biternatus as having: *paired leaves are broadly obovate (egg shaped) to nearly round, with obtuse bases and apices rounded, with petioles 8‚Äì10 mm long, with often obscure palmate to pinnate venation; * branches and stems are circular in cross-section; * the inflorescence is axillary only; *the peduncles of the inflorescence, of the triad, and the pedicel of the flower are all 6‚Äì7 mm long, and are red; *the straight or nearly straight buds are about 4 cm long; *all parts (including the inflorescence and buds) have short dense papillae (nipple like structures); *the inner floral tube has red hairs below the anthers; * the base of the style is smooth (glabrous); * petals colored red at the base and orange or yellow at the apex; * the ellipsoidal fruits are 10‚Äì12 mm long, 9‚Äì10 mm long; and are black when ripe, and are not crowned; * the seeds are 7‚Äì9 mm long, 5 mm wide, and have 2-3 cotyledons. It is hemiparasitic and has no epicortical roots. Psittacanthus biternatus is distinguished from other Psittacanthus species by its generally obovate or circular leaves, its axillary inflorescences in the older branches and its main and secondary peduncles being red, and its uncrowned black fruit. It flowers and fruits throughout the year and is pollinated by hummingbirds and dispersed by birds (tyrannids and traupids). It parasites several species of angiosperms, but more frequently Pouteria ramiflora, Byrsonima coccolobifolia and B. crassifolia. Distribution In Brazil, it is found in the Amazon Rainforest, Caatinga, Central Brazilian Savanna, and the Atlantic Rainforest, inhabiting the vegetation types of Caatinga, Amazonian Campinarana, Cerrado, riverine forest and/or gallery forest, Terra Firme Forest, V√°rzea forest, and coastal forest(Restinga). Taxonomy Psittacanthus biternatus was first described by Johann Centurius Hoffmannsegg in 1829 as Loranthus biternatus, and in 1834, George Don reassigned it to the newly described genus Psittacanthus. Etymology Psittacanthos comes from the Greek psittakos (parrot), and the Greek anthos (flower), possibly chosen, according to Don, because of the bright colours. The specific epithet, biternatus, is the Latin for twice ternate, which according to StearnStearn, W.S. (1992) Botanical Latin (4th Ed.) p. 376. Timber Press, Oregon. means each of the three main divisions, being itself divided in three.

It consists of waging covert war against India using insurgents at multiple locations. According to scholar Aparna Pande, this view was put forward in various studies by the Pakistani military, particularly in its Staff College, Quetta.: Pande cites, as an example, Col. Javed Hassan, India: A Study in Profile, Quetta: Services Book Club. A Study conducted for the Faculty of Research and Doctrinal Studies, Command and Staff College (1990) Peter Chalk and Christine Fair cite the former director of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) explicating the strategy.: 'In the words of Hamid Gul, the former director general of the ISI: \\"We have gained a lot because of our offensive in Kashmir. This is a psychological and political offensive that is designed to make India bleed through a thousand cuts.\\"' In a 1965 speech to the UN Security Council, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former Prime Minister and former President of Pakistan, declared a thousand-year war against India. Reetika Sharma writes that Pakistani Army Chief General Zia-ul- Haq gave form to Bhutto's \\"thousand years war\\" with the 'bleeding India through a thousand cuts' doctrine using covert and low-intensity warfare with militancy and infiltration. This doctrine was first attempted during the Punjab insurgency and then in Kashmir insurgency using India's western border with Pakistan. India's borders with Nepal and Bangladesh have been used as points to insert trained militants into the country.  Origins  A 2014 political map of India showing the relative location of Pakistan and Bangladesh The origins of the strategic doctrine are attributed to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, then a member of the military regime of the General Ayub Khan, who declared a thousand-year war against India during his speech to the United Nations Security Council in 1965. His plans for the 1971 war included severing the entire eastern India and making it a \\"permanent part\\" of East Pakistan, occupying Kashmir, and turning East Punjab into a separate 'Khalistan'. After the war ended with Pakistan's own dismemberment, he laid down the doctrine of continuing the conflict by \\"inflicting a thousand cuts\\" on India. According to The Pioneer Bhutto declared that Pakistan's success in its 'national' goal of destruction of India would only be possible by \\"delivering a thousand cuts on its body politic\\" and not through a direct conventional war. One of the purposes of the declaration was to divert public attention from internal problems facing Pakistan. On 5 July 1977, Bhutto was deposed by his army chief General Zia-ul-Haq in a military coup before being controversially tried and executed.Pakistan, Zia and after. Abhinav Publications. 1989. pp. 20‚Äì35. . Zia then assumed the office of President of Pakistan in 1978 and the thousand cut policy began taking shape. After the defeat of Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Pakistan was divided and Bangladesh was created. The war clarified that Kashmir could no longer be taken from India by a conventional war. Zia implemented Bhutto's \\"thousand years war\\" with 'Bleed India Through A Thousand Cuts' doctrine using covert and low intensity warfare with militancy and infiltration.  Punjab  Pakistan had been helping the Sikh secessionist movement in the Indian Punjab since the 1970s. Since the early 1980s Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI created a special Punjab cell in its headquarters to support the militant Sikh followers of Bhindranwale and supply them with arms and ammunitions. Terrorist training camps were set up in Pakistan at Lahore and Karachi to train the young Sikhs. Hamid Gul (who had led ISI) had stated about Punjab insurgency that \\"Keeping Punjab destabilized is equivalent to the Pakistan Army having an extra division at no cost to the taxpayers.\\"  Kashmir  After the conclusion of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, the fighters of the Sunni Mujahideen and other Islamic militants had successfully removed the Soviet forces from Afghanistan. The military and civil government of Pakistan sought to utilize these militants in the Kashmir conflict against the Indian Armed Forces in accordance with the \\"thousand cuts\\" doctrine so as to \\"bleed India\\", using Pakistan's nuclear arsenal as a shield. In the 1980s cross-border terrorism started in the Kashmir region as armed and well-trained groups of terrorists were infiltrated into India through the border. Pakistan officially maintained that the terrorism in Kashmir was \\"freedom struggle\\" of Kashmiris and Pakistan only provided moral support to them. But this turned out to be inaccurate as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) stated in the National Assembly of Pakistan that the ISI was sponsoring this support in Kashmir. Pakistan has used the jihadist militias to conduct an asymmetric warfare with India. The militant groups have been used not just as proxies, but predominantly as \\"weapons\\" against India for Pakistan's \\"Bleed India\\" campaign. According to a general involved with the \\"bleed India\\" strategy of infiltrating jihadists into Kashmir: In May 1998, India tested its nuclear weapons at Pokhran-II followed by Pakistani nuclear tests. The Infiltration of Pakistani soldiers disguised as Kashmiri militants into positions on the Indian side of the LOC, resulted in a geographically limited Kargil War, during which the Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed issued a veiled nuclear threat that, 'We will not hesitate to use any weapon in our arsenal to defend our territorial integrity.' After the Kargil War in 1999, the Kargil Review Committee came out with a report which took reference to the concept of Pakistan bleeding India. In Chapter 12, \\"Could Kargil Have Been Avoided?\\", the report said that if the \\"Siachenisation\\" of Kargil had happened prior to the war, that if troops had been stationed there all year round along a wider area, it would have resulted in huge costs \\"and enabled Pakistan to bleed India\\".Kargil Review Committee (July 2000). From Surprise To Reckoning: The Kargil Review Committee Report. New Delhi. Sage Publications. On 13 December 2001 a terrorist attack occurred on the Indian Parliament (during which twelve people, including the five terrorists who attacked the building, were killed) and the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly on 1 October 2001. India claimed that the attacks were carried out by two Pakistan-based terror groups fighting Indian administered Kashmir, the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e- Mohammad, both of whom India has said are backed by Pakistan's ISI\\"Who will strike first\\" , The Economist, 20 December 2001. a charge that Pakistan denied. The military buildup was initiated by India in response to the twin attacks leading to the 2001‚Äì02 India‚ÄìPakistan standoff between India and Pakistan. Troops were amassed on either side of the border and along the Line of Control (LoC) in the region of Kashmir. International media reported the possibility of a nuclear war between the two countries and the implications of the potential conflict on the American-led \\"Global War on Terrorism\\" in nearby Afghanistan. Tensions de-escalated following international diplomatic mediation which resulted in the October 2002 withdrawal of Indian\\"India to withdraw troops from Pak border\\" , Times of India, 16 October 2002. and Pakistani troops\\"Pakistan to withdraw front-line troops\\" , BBC, 17 October 2002. from the international border. In spite of grave provocations, the lack of military retaliation by India was seen as evidence of successful deterrence of India by Pakistan's nuclear capability. According to David A. Robinson the nuclear deterrence has encouraged certain Pakistani elements to further provoke India. He adds that an \\"asymmetric nuclear escalation posture\\" of Pakistan has deterred conventional military power of India and in turn has enabled Pakistan's \\"aggressive strategy of bleeding India by a thousand cuts with little fear of significant retaliation\\".  Present  Presently the Islamic fundamentalists in Bangladesh and Pakistan, through designated terrorist groups such as Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami (HuJI), have joined forces to carry out terrorist attacks on India. ISI field stations in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have been used to launch the trained militants into India. In 2015, a Pakistani High Commission staff who was an ISI agent in Bangladesh had to be withdrawn by Pakistan after his involvement in financing of terrorism activities and fake Indian currency note racket was reported by intelligence sources. He was involved in financing of terrorist organizations Hizb ut-Tahir, Ansarullah Bangla Team and Jamaat-e-Islami. In December 2015, another Pakistani diplomat, a second secretary in the High commission was withdrawn for links with Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh. The Daily Star reported that arrest of Pakistani citizens in Bangladesh with fake Indian currency was a \\"common phenomenon\\". In Bangladesh, HuJI-B provides a safe zone for training as well as help in crossing the border into India. According to Pakistani commentator Pervez Hoodbhoy, \\"Pakistan's 'thousand cuts' policy is in shambles\\". India was able to overcome its losses without weakening of its strength. The International community abhors Jihad. Pakistan's continuation of its covert war called \\"Jihad in Kashmir\\" has caused loss of international support for Pakistan's Kashmir policy, with every jihadist attack reducing Pakistan's moral high ground. At the center of the FATF vote was Hafiz Saeed, an internationally designated Pakistani terrorist, who India blames for various attacks in Jammu and Kashmir. In an interview in May 2016, Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's former ambassador to America, said:  Variations  Following the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes a retired Indian Army major was quoted saying \\"We should bleed China with a thousand cuts\\".

Personal life She was born in North London to Harman and Ellen Bigby, in 1904. Her father was landlord of the Vine Inn in Waltham Cross at the time of his death in a motor accident when she was 13: her mother had died five years earlier. She moved to Birmingham to live with a married older brother and an uncle, and then in 1920 moved to Coventry, to the White Lion pub run by a family friend, where she learned the licensed trade. She married Walter Eric Hyde in 1923 and they had one son, Eric. She died on 15 April 1963 while on holiday in Scotland when a car she was driving collided with a lorry. Political career Hyde joined the Labour party in 1931, and was elected to Coventry council for the Walsgrave ward in 1937, after standing for election unsuccessfully three times in the Westwood ward. She became an alderman in 1952 and the city's first female lord mayor in 1957, with her daughter-in-law Elizabeth Hyde as her lady mayoress. Voluntary work Hyde was leader of Coventry's Women's Voluntary Services during the World War II, and afterwards until 1958. She was appointed MBE for her services during the Coventry Blitz of 1940: she appears in Humphrey Jennings' 1941 documentary The Heart of Britain, saying \\"You know you feel such fools standing there in a crater with a mug of tea ‚Ä¶ until a man says \\"it washed the blood and dust from my mouth\\" and you know you really have done something useful\\". Other work From 1943 to 1959 Hyde worked as welfare officer at Lea Francis Cars, and from 1960 as a public relations executive with ATV.

Portugal joined International Monetary Fund (IMF) on March 29, 1961. They joined by submitting 100 percent of their quota, which is 2,060.10 SDR. Currently, Portugal is using 187.5 percent of their quota, which is 3,862.69 SDR. Portugal has not had an IMF disbursement since 2014. Portugal has just .44 percent of voting power in the IMF.  Constituency  Portugal is part of a constituency with Albania, Greece, Italy, Malta, and San Marino. Their representative on the Executive Board of the IMF is Domenico G. Fanizza of Italy. Portugal has 22,066 votes, which makes them have the third most votes in their constituency, preceded by Greece, then Italy. This constituency has 4.13 percent of the total voting power within the IMF.  Surveillance  As Portugal is a member of the IMF, they receive surveillance reports from the IMF which details any red flags in their economy, as well as give suggestions for the future health of their economy. Before the 2007 financial crisis, they IMF conducted several surveillance reports on Portugal that if heeded, could have lessened the effect of the crisis. Some of the issues that were highlighted were the increase in small scale economic asymmetries, lessening growth, lack of monetary consolidation, a lack of competition, ignorance of their capital flow issues, and issues with private sector borrowing.  Financial crisis  In 2007, when the world was swept with financial crisis, Portugal's economy suffered in several areas. Portugal was plagued with low real GDP growth and borrowing costs, significant deficits, low investment, and high national debt. Additionally, the quick stop of capital flows in Portugal was made easier because of this increasing amount of debt that was being accrued. By 2009, it seemed like Portugal would start to recover, but the Euro Crisis quickly took the Portuguese economy back down with it.  Agreement  By 2011, the crisis was so bad, Portugal requested a three year long bailout with the IMF. The same year, Portugal received a disbursement of 11,503,000 SDR as their first of this deal. The agreement that Portugal and the IMF made focused on both monetary contraction and reforms on economic structure. The IMF reforms for Portugal included changes to labor and product markets, taxes, pensions and the public and the financial sector.  Conditions  There were several conditions placed on Portugal in exchange for this bailout. These conditions included structural benchmarks and prior actions predominately in Portugal's fiscal sector.  Results  Portuguese national debt skyrocketed during the 2010-2014 Financial Crisis, but is slowly trending down. There were mixed results of this IMF program. On one hand, Portugal recovered their access to Capital markets, which was a main goal of the program and the largest contributor to their crisis. On the other hand, the Portuguese government still has significant debt and unstable foreign liabilities.  Current Economic Status  As a member of the IMF, Portugal also receives Article IV reports from the IMF. In the latest report, that was published in September 2018 the IMF details a report on the current Portuguese economy. This report details that although investments and exports have spurred growth and low inflation throughout 2017, there is persisting unemployment in Portugal. Structural balance is also said to be improving as deficits and debt are steadily decreasing. Banks are improving as well, though credit is growing much slower and is holding back further improvement. Overall, the economy is steady, but Portugal is still susceptible to downturns and needs more tenable growth.

Pausanias wrote that on the island was the tomb of Sphaerus (), who was a charioteer of Pelops.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 2.33.1 In addition, he wrote that according to legend Aethra saw Athena in a dream, and Athena told her to go to the island to give offerings to Sphaerus. Aethra went to the island and Poseidon had intercourse with her there. For this reason Aethra set up a temple of Athena Apaturia () on the island.

Furthermore, she also established a custom for the Troezenian maidens of dedicating their girdles before wedlock to Athena Apaturia.

The tournament concluded on December 15 with a single game, played as the 63rd Annual NAIA Football National Championship. The championship game was played at Municipal Stadium in Daytona Beach, Florida. This was the 5th consecutive time the championship game was played at this venue after the prior six games had been played at Barron Stadium in Rome, Georgia. It was also the final game played at this venue after it was announced that the 2019 championship game will be played in Grambling, Louisiana. The game was contested between two teams that had never before won a football national championship. On the visiting side of the scoreboard was the once-beaten, #7-ranked Benedictine Ravens, representing Benedictine College from Atchison, Kansas. The home team was the unbeaten, #1-ranked Morningside Mustangs, playing for Morningside College of Sioux City, Iowa. Benedictine was making its first appearance in the championship game while Morningside was appearing for the second time, losing the 2012 championship game in overtime to the Marian Knights. Morningside was led by the quarterback-receiver duo of Trent Solsma and Connor Niles. Solsma was a first-team All-American who had just received the Rawlings Award in a banquet the prior evening. The award recognized the 2018 NAIA Football Player of the Year. Niles was a second-team All-American, a controversial achievement because many consider Solsma-to-Niles to be one of the most productive duos in NAIA football history. But an NAIA rule restricts the selection of players from the same team. So Solsma received the first-team choice, and Niles was the second-team selection. In the end, this duo led Morningside to the victory, 35-28. They connected for 3 touchdown passes during the game. For his efforts, Niles was named the game's Most Outstanding Offensive Player. The parallel defensive award was given to Morningside defensive lineman Chase Reis. Postseason playoff A total of sixteen teams were selected to participate in the single-elimination tournament from across the country, with invitations that were revealed on Sunday, November 11, 2018. The field included eleven conference champions who received automatic bids. The field was then filled with at-large selections that were awarded to the highest ranked teams that were not conference champions. First-round seedings were based on the final regular-season edition of the 2018 NAIA Coaches' Poll, with certain minor modifications given based on geographic considerations. Each subsequent round will be re-seeded based on the rankings of all teams advancing to that round. Quarterfinal pairings were announced by the NAIA on November 17, after the first round results were known.

It focuses on the development of internet culture, the nature of political correctness, the far-right and the election of Donald Trump. Nagle offers a left-wing critique of contemporary liberalism and its role in the creation of the alt-right movement in reaction. Synopsis Nagle presents her work as an attempt to map the online culture wars that occurred in the early 2010s and how it resulted in the development of Alt-Right which played a major role in the election of Donald Trump. Nagle introduces the 2010s as a period in which \\"cyber utopianism\\" began to emerge with the rise of internet-based social activism such as the Arab Spring, Occupy movement, WikiLeaks, adbusters, and Anonymous which were based on decentralized leadership and online organization. This internet-based activism was immediately embraced by much of mainstream liberalism without any rigorous analysis or appraisal of the organizational structure and limitations of these internet-based movements, which all resulted in consistent failure and eventual collapse. Many of these movements began on image-based online forums such as 4chan and 8chan. These forums, organized on the basis of anonymity, developed a subculture among the users that combined extremely transgressive and dark humor with a deeply misogynistic and racist attitude. In the second chapter, titled \\"The Online Politics of Transgression\\", Nagle observes how political transgression historically is associated with the political Left, specifically that of the New Left which was adopted by the Alt-Right. Nagle frames this adoption of transgression by the political right, in relation to the concept of moral transgression which can be traced to the eighteenth century figures of Marquis De Sade, The Surrealists, Friedrich Nietzsche, Punk subculture, and contemporaneously in the 1990s 'male rampage films' like American Psycho and Fight Club. This 'transgressive anti-moral style' of the Alt-Right, according to Nagle, is their attempt to completely break away from the egalitarian philosophy of the Left and the Christian morality of the Right. In chapter three, \\"Gramscians of the Alt-Lite\\", Nagle focuses on the popularity of the French New Right within the circles of the Alt-Right. Publication and reception Kill All Normies received a polarizing reception from critics and columnists, with Vice, New York, and The New Republic publishing positive reviews of the book, whereas outlets such as The Daily Beast, Libcom, CounterPunch, and The New Socialist criticized Nagle's description of campus activism. A review at The Daily Beast said the book was plagued by \\"sloppy sourcing\\", noting an allegation that parts of the book had been plagiarized. Nagle and her publisher both rejected the accusations. Columnist Ross Douthat of the New York Times praised Nagle's \\"portrait of the online cultural war\\", and the Times columnist Michelle Goldberg said that Kill All Normies had \\"captured this phenomenon\\". Novelist George Saunders listed Kill All Normies as one of his ten favorite books helping him through the ‚Äúcurrent political moment‚Äú. An episode of the Fusion Networks' TV series Trumpland directed by Leighton Woodhouse was based on the book. A Spanish edition was published in May 2018 by Orciny Press, and a German edition in September 2018 by Transcript.

Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics The oldest rocks in Argentina date to the Precambrian. Strontium, oxygen and carbon isotope data from carbonate rocks in the Sierra de Pie de Palo are part of an ophiolite unit related to the Grenville orogeny, formed as cover rock in the Appalachian margin of the continent Laurentia around 720 million years ago. These Neoproterozoic age rocks are believed to have formed above much older Archean craton rock. Throughout the late Proterozoic, sections of Argentina were part of a metamorphic mobile belt adjacent to the Brazilian Shield. Regional metamorphism produced scheelite belts and wolframite in parts of San Luis and Cordoba Provinces. To the north, along the Bolivian border in the Altiplano, drilling has revealed Precambrian Hornblende Granoblastite and biotite Granoblastite formed from magma during the Grenville orogeny 1.05 billion years ago metamorphosed around 530 million years ago. Granitoid and metamorphic rocks elsewhere in the El Cristo area in the southern Tandilia Range experienced intense folding more than two billion years ago and then metamorphosed to almandine grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies 1.8 billion years ago. Brittle deformation, granite emplacement and chloritization occurred in the formation 900 million years ago. Extremely ancient trace fossils have been found in the Puncoviscana Formation in the northwest, which grades into gneiss, schist and migmatite, as well as conglomerates, pelagic clay and volcanic rocks. Large areas of Argentina were part of the supercontinent Gondwana, inferred from detrital zircon grains. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= In the Paleozoic, Argentina was located at a point in western Gondwana where the current African and South American cratons joined. Graywacke samples from the Puncoviscana Formation have zircon age patterns that suggest the crystals eroded out of active-margin mountain belts in the Brazilian Shield. Ice ages occurred in the Carboniferous and Early Permian in two main glacial periods. Carboniferous glacial deposits are well preserved in the San Eduardo Group in the western side of the Precordillera. The discovery of glacial deposits and marine sediments far east of the main deposits suggests that global changes in climate and latitude played a bigger role than altitude in the ice ages. The Rio Blanco Basin and Paganzo Basin in western Argentina include sedimentary sequences that from bottom to top include marine sediments, an erosional surface with conglomerate, fluvial and shallow marine deposits, shale and diamictite, as well as shallow marine and glacial outwash deposits. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= During the Mesozoic, basins formed in what would become the Andean foothills, due to strike-slip movement and continental extension. The Choiyoi Group is a remnant of bimodal magmatism along a Paleozoic terrane suture. As the breakup of Gondwana began, narrow half-grabens filled with volcaniclastic rocks and the Pampa de Agnia Basin formed along the Gastre fault system. The Magallenes Basin experienced rifting and the Chon Aike province witnessed intraplate volcanism during the acceleration of the breakup around 180 to 165 million years ago, as the Weddell Sea opened. Explosive volcanism occurred in back arc basins through the Jurassic and low oxygen conditions prevailed in the Neuquen Basin sedimentary environment. Compressional tectonic forces were the norm in Argentine Tierra del Fuego. The volcanite and breccia of the Lemaire Formation, deep marine andesite turbidite of the Yahgan Formation, and slope mudstones of the Beauvoir Formation were metamorphosed in the Rocas Verdes Marginal Basin. The Malvinas and Austral basins originated during uplift of the region in the Campanian. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= The Andes orogeny took place during the Cenozoic. Rifting and strike-slip faulting in weak Cretaceous magmatic arc rocks was reactivated with the collision of the South America and Nazca plates around nine million years ago. Uplift began around seven million years ago in the Sierra Pampeanas, a group of reverse fault-bounded Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks in the central Andes foreland basin. To the south, in Tierra del Fuego, turbidites accumulated in the basins formed in the late Cretaceous, producing the Paleocene Rio Claro Group, the Eocene La Despedida Group and the Oligocene Cabo Domingo Group. Outside of Antarctica, the chronology of the Patagonian glaciers is the best documented in the Southern Hemisphere. Glaciation began around seven million years ago in the Miocene and Pliocene. A sequence of eight glaciations peaked with the Great Patagonian Glaciations in the early Pleistocene. Paleosols and loess formed in the Pampas, very similar to sediments in northern China although less well preserved.

Ecker (born September 2, 1985) is a Pennsylvania politician and the Representative for the 193rd District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Career Torren Ecker is an attorney at a Hanover-based law firm. He also works with the East Berlin Community Center, the Hanover Chamber of Commerce, and the Rotary Club. Ecker worked as a legislative aid to Republican Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis in Virginia's 1st congressional district. Political career Ecker is a self-described conservative, and, in the early stages of his first campaign, promised to bring his \\"fiscal responsibility to Harrisburg to protect the hardworking families of the district.\\" He has stated that he is a supporter of Second Amendment rights, but believes that these rights can be balanced when addressing issues like school safety. Ecker has stated that the school funding formula in Pennsylvania is inequitable and should be changed, and that the Commonwealth needs to increase funding for vocational programs and apprenticeships as a means of workforce development. He has also suggested that the public schoolteacher pension system needs to be reformed. In 2018, Ecker campaigned on stopping Tom Wolf's \\"Liberal Agenda\\" and \\"Massive Tax Increases,\\" but expressed gratitude that the Governor has supported increasing funding for apprenticeship programs. In the 2019-2020 Legislative session, Ecker was placed on the Children and Youth, Game and Fisheries, Labor and Industry, Veteran Affairs and Emergency Preparedness, and Judiciary committees. During the 2019 Coronavirus pandemic, Ecker voted in favor of a bill that would terminate Governor Wolf's declaration of emergency, which served as the legal authority for much of the official response to the pandemic. In a post on his official Facebook page, Ecker noted that \\"Pennsylvania will remain under the federal emergency declaration and CDC safety guidance would still apply,\\" while cautioning \\"that nothing legally will change until the court rules or the governor follows the direction of the Legislature and cancels his emergency declaration.\\" Ecker did not co-sponsor a resolution from Daryl Metcalfe that would have initiated impeachment proceedings against Governor Wolf for his response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Electoral History=2018= After Will Tallman announced he would not run for re-election in 2018, four candidates entered the Republican Primary in the 193rd District. Torren Ecker won the May 15th Primary by a one-vote margin over Barry Cockley, John Wardle, and Andrew Myers, receiving a total of 1,784 votes; initially, results indicated that Cockley had won by one vote, but a provisional ballot and absentee ballot that were originally uncounted were included in the final tally in favor of Ecker. In the 2018 Election, receiving just over two-thirds of the vote, Ecker defeated his Democratic opponent Matt Nelson. Personal life Ecker lives just outside of Hanover, Pennsylvania with his wife Laura, a special education teacher, and his two children, Addy and Oliver. He is a graduate of Spring Grove Area High School, George Mason University, and the Thomas M. Cooley Law School at Western Michigan University.

EKRA targets patient brokers who recruit patients, shopping them to the provider offering the highest kickbacks. EKRA is codified at 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 220. It generally prohibits anyone from paying, receiving, or soliciting, any remuneration in return for referrals to recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities, or laboratories. In this respect, EKRA operates much like the Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b), but focused on substance about recovery. Notably, EKRA prohibits paying for any referrals to clinical laboratories whether or not they perform substance abuse testing. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, EKRA contains a number of safe-harbor relationships that do not trigger the statute's prohibition. In January 2020, the Department of Justice announced what is believed to be its first conviction under EKRA. The target of the prosecution was an office manager of a substance abuse treatment clinic in Kentucky, who admitted to soliciting kickbacks from the CEO of a urine drug testing lab in exchange for the clinic‚Äôs business. *Empowering Pharmacists in the Fight Against Opioid Abuse Act *Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act of 2018 *Fighting Opioid Abuse in Transportation Act *IMD CARE Act *Individuals in Medicaid Deserve Care that is Appropriate and Responsible in its Execution Act *Medicaid IMD ADDITIONAL INFO Act *Medicaid Institutes for Mental Disease Are Decisive in Delivering Inpatient Treatment for Individuals but Opportunities for Needed Access are Limited without *Information Needed about Facility Obligations Act *Medicaid PARTNERSHIP Act *Medicaid Providers Are Required To Note Experiences in Record Systems to Help In-need Patients Act *Medicaid Reentry Act *Opioid Addiction Action Plan Act *Opioid Addiction Recovery Fraud Prevention Act of 2018 *Opioid Quota Reform Act *PASS Act of 2018 *PROPER Act of 2018 *Preventing Addiction for Susceptible Seniors Act of 2018 *Preventing Drug Diversion Act of 2018 *Providing Reliable Options for Patients and Educational Resources Act of 2018 *REACH OUT Act of 2018 *REGROUP Act of 2018 *Reauthorizing and Extending Grants for Recovery from Opioid Use Programs Act of 2018 *Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy Outcomes for Users' Treatment Act of 2018 *SCREEN Act *SOUND Disposal and Packaging Act *STOP Act of 2018 *Safe Disposal of Unused Medication Act *Securing Opioids and Unused Narcotics with Deliberate Disposal and Packaging Act of 2018 *Special Registration for Telemedicine Clarification Act of 2018 *Stop Counterfeit Drugs by Regulating and Enhancing Enforcement Now Act *Stop Illicit Drug Importation Act of 2018 *Substance Abuse Prevention Act of 2018 *Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act of 2018 *Treating Barriers to Prosperity Act of 2018 *Using Data To Prevent Opioid Diversion Act of 2018 ReferencesExternal links *https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th- congress/house-bill/6 *https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-signs- sweeping-opioid-bill-vow-end-scourge-drug-addiction-n923976 *https://www.foxnews.com/health/trump-signs-bipartisan-opioid-bill-aimed-at- curbing-national-crisis United States federal law Opioids in the United States ","title":"SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act"},{"id":"58997387","text":"Larisa Lvovna Maksimova (, born 1943) is a Russian mathematical logician known for her research in non-classical logic.

Next, she returned to mercantile service and in 1814 a French privateer captured her, but the British Royal Navy recaptured her the next day. She sailed to India in 1818 under a license from the British East India Company (EIC}, and was wrecked in March 1819 while inbound to Calcutta. Career Paragon first appeared in the registers with an entry in the 1800 Register of Shipping.

Her subsequent trades were Newcastle‚ÄìBaltic (1801), and London‚ÄìHamburg (1801‚Äì1802). Following the resumption of war with France in early 1803, concern developed in Britain about Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom. The British government's response took many forms including the reactivation of Fencible regiments and the Sea Fencibles, a program of the construction of Martello Towers along the coasts of Britain and Ireland, and the commissioning of a number of armed defense ships. The British East India Company in November voted to underwrite 10,000 tons (bm) of armed transports to protect Great Britain's coasts. The vessels were existing, but not EIC, merchantmen that would receive an upgrade in armament and in some cases a naval officer as captain. The vessels were: Albion, , , Aurora, , , , Helder, , , Lord Nelson, , Paragon, , , Sir Alexander Mitchell, , and Triton. On 21 November 1803 Paragon, of 400 tons (bm) and 16 guns, was ready but yet to be allocated to her station.Naval Database. Paragon was reported at various times at the Humber and Hull.

In the fall of 1805 a small naval squadron under the orders of Commodore Sir Home Popham escorted a fleet of transports, including Paragon, and East Indiamen carrying some 5000 soldiers under the command of Major- general Sir David Baird to attack the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope. The fleet assembled at Madeira and touched at St. Salvador to replenish supplies. The expedition sailed again on the 26 November, and on 4 January 1806, in the evening, anchored to the west of Robben Island, preparatory to taking the Dutch colony. After the invasion, on 7 February, Paragon sailed for Algoa Bay with troops to load lumber for military works. Paragon disappeared from the registers between 1811 and 1814, and may have served as a government transport.

Early life  Joan Marion Crockford was born in January 1919 at Hunters Hill, New South Wales. She attended Quambaar School in Bellevue Hill and enrolled in the University of Sydney in 1937, where she studied geology. She graduated with a B.Sc. in 1939, and took honours and a University Medal in 1940.  Career  Crockford earned a Science Research Scholarship in 1940, and worked as a demonstrator in 1941. She graduated with her M.Sc. in 1942, and continued her research under a Linnean Society of New South Wales Macleay Fellowship for a further three years. Due to staff shortages during World War II, Crockford continued to teach during her fellowship. Wartime restrictions also affected research, with makeshift motors being devised in the Physics department to run the slide-making tools, and materials having to be mailed to her from colleagues in Queensland (Dorothy Hill), Tasmania and Western Australia (Curt Teichert), rather than conducted on site. Crockford married George Beattie in 1945 and moved to Cobar in 1946. She continued working on her D.Sc., completing papers on Bryozoa with the help of specimens and thin sections she took with her and from staff at the Australian Museum. She graduated in 1951, and was now the mother of a three year old. Crockford-Beattie obtained work through Dr Norman Fisher with the Bureau of Mineral Resources in Canberra, describing photographs and slides of Bryozoans in their collection obtained from the Kimberley region. This work was completed by 1956 and was published in 1957. In total, she published over 16 papers. The family moved to a number of locations due to George Beattie's work as a mining engineer including Cracow, Queensland and Radium Hill.

The school does not have departments. Instead, it organizes its research around interdisciplinary ‚Äúthemes‚Äù: immuno- engineering, quantum engineering, autonomous materials, and water and energy. PME works toward technological advancements in areas of global importance, including sustainable energy and natural resources, immunotherapy-based approaches to cancer, ‚Äúunhackable‚Äù communications networks, and a clean global water supply. The school plans to expand its research areas to address more issues of global importance.  History  IME was established in 2011, after three years of discussion and review. It was the largest academic program founded by the University of Chicago since 1988, when the Harris School of Public Policy Studies was established. Matthew Tirrell was appointed founding Pritzker Director of IME in July 2011. The Pritzker Directorship honors the Pritzker Foundation, which donated a large gift in support of the institute. Tirrell is a researcher in biomolecular engineering and nanotechnology. His honors include election to the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Sciences. He became dean of PME in 2019. The William Eckhardt Research Center (WERC), which houses the school and part of the Physical Sciences Division, was constructed between 2011 and 2015. The WERC was named for alumnus William Eckhardt, in recognition of his donation to support scientific research at the university. In 2019, the school received more than $23.1 million in research funding. From 2011 to 2019, faculty at the school have filed 69 invention disclosures and have created six companies. On May 28, 2019, the University of Chicago announced a $100 million commitment from the Pritzker Foundation to support the institute‚Äôs transition to a school‚Äîthe first school of molecular engineering in the U.S. The Pritzker Foundation helped establish the school with a new donation of $75 million, adding to an earlier $25 million donation that supported the institute and the construction of the Pritzker Nanofabrication Facility. In 2019, PME became the university‚Äôs first new school in three decades.  Education  PME offers a graduate program in molecular engineering for both Master and Ph.D. students, as well as an undergraduate major and minor in molecular engineering offered with the College of the University of Chicago. The institute began accepting applications to its doctoral program in fall 2013. The first class of graduate students was matriculated the following fall. In 2019, the school had 28 faculty members, 91 undergraduate students, 134 graduate students, and 75 postdoctoral fellows. The graduate program curriculum includes various science and engineering disciplines, product design, entrepreneurship, and communication. The program is interdisciplinary, featuring a connected art program called STAGE Lab. STAGE Lab creates plays and films in the context of scientific research at PME. The undergraduate major was added in spring 2015. It was the first engineering major offered at the University of Chicago. In 2018, the first undergraduate class received degrees in molecular engineering. When the school was established in 2019, it announced plans to expand its undergraduate offerings. David Awschalom, a professor at PME, said the school has contributed to Chicago becoming a hub for quantum education and research. PME offers an advanced degree in quantum science and engineering. It also partnered with Harvard University to launch the Quantum Information Science and Engineering Network, a graduate student training program in quantum science and engineering. Participating students are paired with two mentors‚Äîone from academia and one from industry. The program was funded by a $1.6 million award from the National Science Foundation. The school‚Äôs partnership with Argonne National Laboratory provides additional opportunities for research and innovation. Argonne‚Äôs facilities include the Advanced Photon Source, the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, and the Center for Nanoscale Materials. The lab also has experience licensing new technology for industrial and commercial applications. PME‚Äôs educational outreach initiatives include K-12 programs with events and internships throughout the year. In 2019, with the establishment of PME, the school also launched a partnership with City Colleges of Chicago. The multi-year program connects City College students interested in STEM fields with PME faculty and labs, with the goal of enabling these students to transfer into four-year STEM degree programs.

Despite being from a Jewish family, Wilhelm and Gertrud were Protestants, as were their children: Ernst, Fred, and Irene. Ernst attended the Kaiser-Friedrich-Schule in Berlin, followed by the Goethe-Gymnasium zu Frankfurt. He decided he wanted to become a geneticist after reading a copy of Richard Goldschmidt's book Ascaris, eine Einf√ºhrung in die Wissenschaft vom Leben f√ºr Jedermann as a Christmas present when he was 14. He emigrated to the United States in 1938, and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1944. He was trained by Alfred K√ºhn at the University of G√∂ttingen, receiving his Ph.D. there in 1933. He was forced by the Nazis to leave his position in K√ºhn's lab later that year. Academic career Caspari became a fellow of biology at Lafayette College in 1938, where he became an assistant professor of biology in 1941. At Lafayette, he met L. C. Dunn, with whom he subsequently collaborated on several topics in mouse genetics research. He served as a professor of biology at Wesleyan University from 1949 to 1960, when he became professor and chairman of the Department of Biology at the University of Rochester. He remained on the faculty of the University of Rochester until his retirement in 1975. He was president of the Genetics Society of America in 1966 and the editor-in-chief of its journal, Genetics, from 1968 to 1972.

William Tasman Drake (2 December 1884 ‚Äì 15 April 1946) was an Anglican clergyman and cricketer in New Zealand. Life and clerical career Tasman Drake was born in Hobart, Tasmania, but his family moved to New Zealand, and he was educated at schools in Invercargill and Dunedin. He studied for the Anglican clergy at Selwyn College in Dunedin. He married Mary Mitchell (1887‚Äì1968) in Dunedin in December 1914. They had two sons and a daughter. One of his brothers was Ernest Drake, a popular tenor and conductor in New Zealand. Drake served the Anglican Church as curate at Dunstan in Central Otago, vicar of Maniototo in Naseby from 1915, curate at Gisborne from 1918, vicar of Puketapu in Hawke's Bay from 1921, and vicar of Port Ahuriri in Napier from 1922 to 1927. After some time off for his health, he was organising secretary of the Diocese of Waiapu from 1929 to 1931, vicar of Waipawa in Hawke's Bay from 1931 to 1938, and vicar of St Matthew‚Äôs Church, Hastings, from 1938 until his death in 1946. Cricket career Drake's career in rural parishes in his younger days made it difficult for him to establish himself as a cricketer. He was prominent in local cricket as an all-rounder. Playing in two one-day matches for Naseby against Ranfurly in November and December 1914, he opened both the batting and the bowling, taking 6 for 33 in the first match, and making the match top score with 34 (\\"a good and merry innings\\") and taking 5 for 22 in the second. During his residence in Gisborne he played several representative matches for Poverty Bay. His batting helped them defend the Hawke Cup twice in 1920 and 1921 when, opening the batting, he made the highest score on either side in each match: 45 not out against Manawatu and 63 against Wanganui. He was selected to represent the New Zealand Minor Associations in a first-class match against the touring Australians in March 1921. He and his teammates were overwhelmed by the Australians by an innings inside two days of the scheduled three-day match, but he did make 15 opening the first innings, which was the equal second-highest score for the innings; he also took a wicket. At the time of his first-class match he was described as \\"a sound bat with an extremely ugly but effective style [who] scores well all round the wicket\\", a \\"very useful change bowler and a brilliant field in any position\\".

Etymology The type species of Klobiodon is Klobiodon rochei. The generic name Klobiodon means \\"small cage tooth,\\" from the Greek Œ∫ŒªœâŒ≤ŒØŒøŒΩ, klobion, \\"little cage\\", and ·ΩÄŒ¥œéŒΩ, odon, \\"tooth\\", in reference to the large anterior laniaries that appear to form a fish grab, while the specific name rochei honors the comic book artist Nick Roche for his anatomically correct designs inspired by dinosaurs. Discovery The holotype of Klobiodon rochei, NHMUK PV OR 47991, was first mentioned by George Robert Waterhouse (1878) as part of the collection of the British Museum of Natural History, where he mentions Richard Owen intended to name the specimen Pterodactylus raptor in an unpublished manuscript.

Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 63 (X): xxx‚Äìxxx. http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app63/app004902018.pdf Description Klobiodon is one of the largest pterosaurs known from the middle Jurassic. Its adult wingspan was estimated at two metres. The describing authors established a number of distinguishing traits. The lower jaw shows a unique combination of elongated front fang-like laniaries with short and robust teeth in a more backward position. The teeth more to the rear are at least 1.3 times longer than their tooth-sockets are wide. The rear laniary is at least 1.4 times and perhaps 2.4 times longer than the tooth to its rear (which could be an only partially erupted replacement tooth). The longest laniaries are at least 1.5 times taller than the vertical thickness of the front tooth-bearing lower jaw bone, the dentary, at its tallest point. The right lower jaw has a preserved length of fourteen centimetres. To the front, it gradually curves to below. A piece at the front has broken off. The original length of the jaw including this piece was estimated at about eighteen centimetres. The missing piece was assumed by the authors to have borne one additional tooth. The fossil shows four teeth, which then would have been the second to fifth. The second and third teeth are elongated, recurved and inclined to the front. Such teeth are called laniaries. The fourth and fifth teeth are noticeably shorter but almost as wide, giving them a robust appearance. They are also straighter, especially at their rear edges, and perpendicular to the jaw. Phylogeny Klobiodon was placed in the Rhamphorhynchidae in 2018. At several places in the describing article, a position in the Rhamphorhynchinae is suggested, but the authors eventually determine that it might also be member of the Scaphognathinae, concluding: \\"Klobiodon rochei is therefore conservatively identified here as a member of the Rhamphorhynchidae rather than assigned to either subgroup\\".

Previously in his career he was mayor of Cali, Colombia's ambassador to the Organization of American States (OAS), foreign minister and numerous countries.  Youth and academic career = Family = Trujillo was born in Cartago, Valle del Cauca. He is the elder son of powerful Liberal Party mogul, congressman, diplomat and attorney Carlos Holmes Trujillo Sr. and Genoveva Garc√≠a. His younger brother Jos√© Ren√°n was also active in politics until 2008. = Education = Trujillo received his primary education at the private Liceo Cartago and his high school education at the Pio XII high school in Cali. Following in his father's footsteps, he went to law school at the University of Cauca where he specialized in criminal law. At 25 he was appointed consul in Tokyo, Japan where he continued his studies and received a master's degree in International Business.  Early political career = Return to Colombia = After finishing his education in Tokyo, Trujillo returned to Colombia in 1983 and was appointed Cali's Finance Secretary by Mayor Julio Riascos (Conservative Party). After Riascos resigned a year later, Trujillo became director of Colombia's metal federation. Meanwhile, Trujillo made career inside his father's Liberal Party and became the political powerhouse's vice-president. = Mayor of Cali = Trujillo became Cali's first elected mayor in 1988 and remained in that position until 1990, avoiding confrontations with the Cali Cartel that was becoming increasingly powerful in the city and corrupting much of Cali's public institutions. While formally running Colombia's third largest city, Trujillo expanded his power by founding the Colombian Federation of Municipalities (FCM) and becoming its chairman.  National politics = Minister under a new constitution = As FCM chairman and vice-president of the Liberal Party, Trujillo took part in formulating Colombia's 1991 constitution that was part of a peace process with the M-19, a guerrilla group that since 1970 had violently opposed the oligarchical political system of which Trujillo had become a prominent member. Following elections that same year, President C√©sar Gaviria (Liberal Party) appointed Trujillo education minister, a position he held from 1992 until the end of Gaviria's term in 1994. = Peace policies and paramilitaries = Following that year's election of another liberal President, Ernesto Samper, Trujillo was appointed High Commissioner of Peace. During this two-year period, legal paramilitary groups called CONVIVIR and illegal paramilitary groups like the ACCU teamed up with drug traffickers and the military to brutally combat far- left guerrilla groups like the FARC and the ELN, and assassinate leftist politicians. = Proceso 8000 and the OAS = The president appointed Trujillo as ambassador to the OAS in the middle of Proceso 8000, a criminal investigation into Cali Cartel Funding of Samper's presidential campaign the year before. The former Cali mayor was called back in 1997 to replace Interior Minister Horacio Serpa who was forced to resign over the scandal. Trujillo held the position until the end of Samper's presidency.  Diplomatic career  Samper's successor, Andres Pastrana (Conservative Party), took office in 1998 and appointed Trujillo ambassador to Austria. Between 1999 and 2001, Trujillo was ambassador to Russia. Following a short break, Trujillo was again appointed ambassador For Scandinavia in 2004, this time by President √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez. A year later, Iceland also became part of Trujillo's diplomatic portfolio. In 2006, Uribe appointed Trujillo ambassador to the European Union, a post he would hold until after a year after the 2010 election of President Juan Manuel Santos.  Democratic Center  Trujillo (left) speaks to the press with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2019 Trujillo remained close to Uribe after Santos announced peace talks with the FARC and joined other hard-line politicians like Francisco Santos and Oscar Ivan Zuluaga, and far- right politicians like Fernando Londo√±o and Fabio Valencia Cossio in 2013 to form the \\"Uribista\\" Democratic Center (CD) party. = \\"Uribistas\\" enter Congress = Trujillo became Zuluaga's running-mate in opposition to Santos in the 2014 elections, but failed to defeat the incumbent president, who by then was in the middle of peace talks with the FARC that were fiercely opposed by the \\"Uribistas.\\" The party did become the fourth largest in Congress and, under the leadership of Uribe in the Senate, became the most important opposition party to Santos, and in particular the peace talks with the guerrillas. Despite the fierce opposition from both the Democratic Center, conservative media and a large portion of the Colombian public, Santos signed peace with the country's oldest rebel group in November 2016 and kicked off a peace process in December that year. From Congress, Uribe and his party fiercely opposed the process. = Duque presidency = Trujillo competed in the 2017 pre-election race to become the \\"uribista\\" candidate in 2018, but lost to the relatively unknown Senator Ivan Duque, whose political career had begun only four years earlier when he entered the Senate on the CD list. Duque won the 2018 elections and appointed Trujillo minister of foreign affairs.

She was also an activist and educator and took part in the Italian resistance movement. The daughter of Giustina Poli, a teacher, and Fruttuoso Merlin, secretary for the municipality, she was born in Pozzonovo and grew up in Chioggia. In 1907, she received her diploma qualifying her to teach elementary school. In 1914, she received her qualification to teach French in middle school but preferred to continue to teach elementary school. In March 1926, because she refused to take an oath of loyalty to Italy's Fascist government, she was removed from her teaching position. In November of that year, she was sentenced to five years in prison; her sentence was reduced and she returned to Padua in November 1929. She moved to Milan in 1930; to support herself, she gave private lessons in French. In 1919, she joined the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). Merlin contributed to the socialist weekly Eco dei lavoratori and the periodical La Difesa delle lavoratrici. During World War II, she took part in the resistance against the fascists. She participated in the founding of the , women's defence groups. In 1944, she helped found the and served three terms as its president. In 1946, she was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Italy as a member of the PSI. She was instrumental in ensuring that the rights of women and children were protected in the new constitution. In 1948, she was elected to the Italian Senate of the Republic; she was reelected in 1953. Merlin retired from the socialist party in 1961 and did not run for reelection after her term of office ended in 1963.

Pandjang fought against Dutch forces during the Java War (1741‚Äì1743).  Biography = Origin = Pandjang was originally from Batavia, a Dutch colony in Java. Batavia had been under Dutch control since 1619, when the Dutch East India Company had established a city of the same name. To develop the colony, the Dutch had allowed for thousands of Chinese immigrants to settle in Batavia. Over the next century, these immigrants developed a wealthy community within the Dutch colony. This wealth bred some resentment between the Chinese and the local population. In the 1730s, a devastating malaria outbreak exacerbated issues between the Dutch, Sumatran, and Chinese communities. By 1740, this unrest had grown significantly, resulting in the Dutch colonial authorities cracking down on the rights of Batavia‚Äôs Chinese population. When the Chinese community (which numbered around 10,000 people) resisted these efforts, the Dutch governor-general of Batavia (Adriaan Valckenier) ordered the deportation or killing of the Chinese. This order resulted in the 1740 Batavia massacre, during which thousands of Chinese were killed by the Dutch and Sumatrans.Dharmowijono, W.W. (2009). Van koelies, klontongs en kapiteins: het beeld van de Chinezen in Indisch-Nederlands literair proza 1880‚Äì1950 [Of Coolies, Klontong, and Captains: The Image of the Chinese in Indonesian-Dutch Literary Prose 1880‚Äì1950] (Doctorate in Humanities thesis) (in Dutch). Universiteit van Amsterdaam. Retrieved 1 December 2011. In the midst of the massacre, Khe Pandjang is recorded as having led a group of fleeing Chinese to Kampung Gading Melati. They were soon besieged by 800 Dutch soldiers and several thousand Sumatrans. However, the Chinese were able to break the siege and escape. Having fled Batavia, Pandjang and some of his followers escaped across the Sunda Strait to the island of Java.Setiono, Benny G. (2008). Tionghoa dalam Pusaran Politik [Indonesia's Chinese Community under Political Turmoil] (in Indonesian). Jakarta: TransMedia Pustaka. . pp. 111, 114‚Äì116, 119, 147‚Äì152, 157 = Rebellion in Java = Upon arriving in Western Java, Pandjang attempted to lead his group to Banten. However, the local ruler of Banten blocked the roads and barred the Chinese from entering the city. Having been repulsed, Pandjang instead headed for Semarang, stopping in villages and towns to gather Chinese support for his army. Unlike the Sumatrans, many Javanese did not have an aversion to the Chinese, and a number of local leaders allowed the Chinese insurgents to operate inside their domains. As news of the Dutch actions in Batavia spread, many Chinese rose up in revolt in an attempt to seize control of Java and form a new nation. Pandjang allied himself with these Chinese rebels during what would become known as the Java War, and would become a noted military commander during the conflict. In 1741, Pandjang and his insurgents captured the city of Bekasi in West Java. They held the city until being forced out by a local ruler, after which loss they joined a pro-Chinese Javanese army to capture Tegal. In June 1742, Pandjang and a Javanese commander consolidated their forces and successfully took control of Kartosuro. However, the war in other parts of the island went poorly for the rebels, and by July 1742 the Dutch had reestablished control over much of the island. Pandjang and his forces held Kartosuro until December, but were then forced to retreat to Prambanan, pursued by a Dutch army. The rebels surrendered in early 1743, but Pandjang escaped capture and fled.Raffles, Thomas Stamford (1830) [1817]. The History of Java. 2. London: Black.

A large tribe, the Awamir originated in the steppes to the north of the Hadhramut, settling in the north in a process of migration which took place over 500 years. A subsection of the tribe, 'Afar, was linked to Dhafrah. Some 4,000 Awamir settled outside of Oman proper at the turn of the 20th century and of the whole tribe, numbered at the time as 10,000 strong, some 3,500 were nomadic Bedouin. J. G. Lorimer characterised the Awamir as \\"Reputed brave and warlike but crafty, treacherous and predatory; they are said to plunder indiscriminately all whom they meet...\\"  Bani Yas affiliation  In 1848, Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan was spurred into action against the Wahhabis encamped in Buraimi, capturing his two forts back with the help of the Awamir. The Awamir formed part of the tribal confederacy force he then pulled together and used to clear the oasis and block a relieving army under Sa'ad bin Mutlaq. By 1850, Saeed's great tribal association had cleared Buraimi Oasis of Wahhabi forces. He subsequently accepted a stipend from the Sultan of Muscat for the defence of Buraimi. The Awamir supported Saeed's successor, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan in his extended war with Qatar in the 1880s, a series of conflicts that secured the western border of Abu Dhabi.Al-Hajji 2001, pp 171-4 By the 1920s, the Awamir were central to a number of conflicts between the tribes around Buraimi and Abu Dhabi town, fighting with the Manasir, Duru and Bani Qitab.  Raiding  By the 1930s, the decline of pearling on the Trucial Coast had led to a general recession and the Awamir's raiding activities grew as demand for their camels and services as drivers dropped. The raids on Dubai alone were part of the general unrest (in a time of depression and poverty) felt by the people against their Ruler, Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum Bin Hasher Al Maktoum, leading to the Majlis movement. In 1931 alone several such incidents included raids on camel trains, on settlements and date groves and, in at least one case, sheer vandalism in retaliation against a ruler's punishment of them: they cut down 20 unripe date palms in Umm Al Quwain following an outbreak of looting. This raiding led to open conflict between tribes and Abu Dhabi found itself called to account on behalf of its unruly subjects as raids led to open and bloody warfare between tribes. For the first time, the British were forced to intervene in matters of the interior and broker an agreement between Abu Dhabi and Dubai over their border and the terms of a peace between the tribes. The Awamir had long been in conflict with the Duru and in the 1940s, the ongoing conflict led the headman of the Bedouin Awamir, Salim bin Hamad bin Rakkad, to lead his people to al-Hasa in 1943. They returned in 1948, but in subsequent years were constantly drawn back to Hasa. The bulk of the tribe remained at Buraimi and petitioned the Al Bu Falah for protection. One of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan's first acts when he was appointed wali of Al Ain was to call for Salim bin Mussalam bin Hamm and appoint him as head of the Bedouin Awamir. The portion of the tribe which had moved south under Salim bin Hamad became Saudi citizens and this schism within the Awamir was later to form part of the territorial arguments put forward in the Buraimi Dispute.  Settlement  By the 1950s, some 50 families of the Awamir had acquired date plantations in Buraimi but few settled in Liwa. Staunchly nomadic and focused on breeding and herding camels, the Awamir had no interests in the pearling beyond casual work on the boats and remained essentially nomadic. By 1968, some 1,721 members of the Awamir were identified in a census, many of whom had taken up employment with the oil companies.

He is best remembered today for commissioning Walraven 2, the first aeroplane manufactured in the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia. Biography Khouw Khe Hien with the aircraft he commissioned and flew, Walraven 2 (October 1936). Born on August 29, 1907 in Muntilan, Central Java, Khouw came from a wealthy Peranakan business family. His father, the entrepreneur Khouw Kim Goan, founded N.V. Merbaboe Bedrijven, a large livestock, milk and beverage conglomerate in late colonial Indonesia; and his mother was a pribumi Indonesian woman. He also had a younger sister, Keng Nio, who became noteworthy in her own right as an aviator and businesswoman. Khouw Khe Hien was educated at the Europeesche Lagere School (ELS) in Magelang, then at the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (MULO) in Yogyakarta; only elite non-Europeans were allowed at both institutions. Khouw first became interested in aviation when he realized its potential as a more efficient alternative to land and sea transportation for the family company's many fresh products. To this end, he placed an order in March 1934 for an aircraft from Laurens Walraven, Achmad bin Talim and others, who were technicians in the Luchtvaartafdeling or 'Aviation Service' of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force. Khouw's order specified that the aircraft was to be a twin-engined cabin monoplane, able to carry a cargo of 130 kg and to fly over long distances. Built and assembled at Walraven's private workshop in Bandung, West Java, Khouw's aircraft was finished towards the end of 1934, and was christened Walraven 2. Khouw, who in the meantime had trained as a certified pilot, was so satisfied with Walraven 2 that he made plans for an aircraft factory. In order to gain more publicity, Lieutenant C. Terluin and Khouw, as co-pilot, flew the new aircraft from Batavia, the capital of colonial Indonesia, to Schiphol, Netherlands. A media sensation, the 20-day-long journey was extensively covered on each of its stops, from Singapore to Rangoon, through Calcutta and Aleppo, and on to its final destination. Walraven 2 arrived at Schiphol, Amsterdam to a rapturous welcome; among others, the Indonesian-born Anthony Fokker, founder of the aircraft manufacturer Fokker, was there to greet Khouw and Terluin. In 1937, Khouw also made an equally well-publicized trip on Walraven 2 from Batavia to Hong Kong, and on to Guangzhou, Nanjing and Shanghai in China. He was welcomed at his ancestral country by the then Chinese president, Chiang Kai-shek. Early the following year, however, on February 26, 1938, Khouw was involved in a fatal accident in Cililitan, while flying a Glenn Martin bomber 506 during a blackout exercise. His remains were buried at his native hometown of Muntilan in Central Java. Private life Khouw's mother died in Batavia two months after him in April 1938. His sister, Khouw Keng Nio, took the reins of the family business and expanded it. Khouw Khe Hien was also survived by his widow, Lena Oey Non Nio (1906-1994), and four children, Khouw Teng Han, Khouw Teng Hwa, Khouw Teng Giok and Khouw Teng Hwie, who all eventually migrated to the Netherlands.

A relatively small tribe, they nevertheless managed to intersperse themselves in a number of territorial conflicts which broke out throughout the Trucial States in the 20th Century.  Conflict with Awamir  Although the Duru were on good terms with the Al Bu Shamis and considered themselves dependents of Dubai, they were in conflict with the warlike Awamir, who encroached on their dar or territory. In the 1920s, in Liwa and Buraimi, fighting broke out between the Bedouin tribes, with the Manasir and Bani Yas fighting a southern confederation of Awamir, Duru and Al Bu Shamis. An ally of the Wahhabis, Hamdan managed to broker an uneasy truce. However, fighting broke out again in the Buraimi oasis, between the Duru, Manasir and Bani Qitab. The escalating conflict provided an early challenge for the new Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who marched against the Duru in December 1923. Word got out of his movement and the Duru and Awamir raised a force, together with the Bani Qitab of Falayah, which met a party of 20 riders from Abu Dhabi and killed seven of them and captured the rest. Raising a force of 200 men, the Northern confederation raided Buraimi while Sultan's forces raided Falayah. The Duru, understanding that men from Dubai had been supporting Sultan, raided Dubai in revenge.  Saudi influence  A concerted effort at conciliation followed, as the various Trucial Rulers recognised that the ongoing conflicts were threatening to descend into a state of general war. The Duru, as well as the Al Bu Shamis, sought the protection of the Wahhabi agent, Ibn Jaluwi, who was only too pleased to extend his influence among the tribes of the Trucial States and Oman. This led to an ongoing and bloody conflict and in the 1940s, fighting led the headman of the Bedouin Awamir, Salim bin Hamad bin Rakkad, to lead his people to al-Hasa in 1943.

Cast Following is a list of the full cast of Class of 2018 film: =Main cast= * Sharlene San Pedro as Ada * Nash Aguas as RJ * Kristel Fulgar as Princess * CJ Navato as Migs * Kiray Celis as Venus =Supporting cast=Production T-Rex Entertainment, an independent Filipino production company which started in late 2015, began producing Class of 2018 during the first half of 2018. The project was headed by its executive producer Rex Tiri, who had produced films such as dark comedy Patay na si Hesus in 2016 and comedy-drama musical Deadma Walking in 2017. The film is the eighth full- length film by filmmaker Charliebebs \\"Bebs\\" Gohetia, who had recently directed Bagyong Beverlynn. He described the film as a \\"survival-of-the-fittest\\" movie. He stated: \\"I think what makes it special is it is kind of a reinvention of the (suspense-thriller) genre\\". It deals with a cross-genre theme as it involves suspense, drama, romance, and situational comedy. Together with Jericho Aguado, Gohetia wrote the screenplay of Class of 2018, and later on, he directed the film.Class of 2018. Directed by Charliebebs Gohetia, T-Rex Entertainment, November 7, 2018. =Casting and development= Class of 2018 marks the first film of Aguas and San Pedro as lead actors as well as their first film together as a love team. They were part of the original cast of the sketch comedy show Goin' Bulilit when they were children, together with Fulgar, Navato, and Celis. They were first introduced as cast of the film during its story conference held at Limbaga 77 Cafe in Quezon City on May 22. At the same time, T-Rex Entertainment announced the news on their social media accounts. According to Aguas, their team-up in the film can be considered a fulfilment of their fans' wishes. Since entering the entertainment industry starting from Star Circle Quest back in 2004, NashLene fans (derived from their names: Nash and Sharlene) have already been supporting them as a pair. Aguas mentioned that despite them not being introduced as an official love team, their fans have always been there to support them. The director mentioned the feeling of nostalgia whenever the two are seen together. As claimed by the multimedia magazine Village Pipol: \\"[w]ith Sharlene San Pedro and Nash Aguas' cuteness and palpable chemistry, they became one of the youngest love teams loved by millions of Filipinos\\". San Pedro was surprised to have been given the lead role, as it had been a while since she was given an acting role. Her drama episode in Maalaala Mo Kaya (for which she received the \\"Best Single Performance by an Actress\\" nomination at the 32nd PMPC Star Awards for Television) was her most recent work. She was a regular video jockey in MYX during this time. She was excited because the film is something the Filipino viewers have never seen before; a film they do not normally see on their screens. The film also has elements of dark themes, drama, and rom- com, according to Aguas. The first time San Pedro learned about the project, she was offered to do the character of Princess (which became Fulgar's role later on). The lead roles were initially given to different actors. She thought the story was something new so she accepted the supporting role. The day before the screen test, she was told that she would play Ada's character instead.T-Rex Entertainment. (October 17, 2018). Class of 2018 Movie Presscon [Press release]. Other than scheduling conflicts with the initial actors, the production team felt Aguas and San Pedro would fit better for the roles of RJ and Ada, according to Gohetia. In fact, he suggested them to T-Rex Entertainment during the initial pitch. He shared the sentiment of NashLene fans for wanting Aguas and San Pedro to have a project together. He said: \\"It's a different launching film for them, a new path\\". =Filming= Principal photography on the film began in early June in the Philippines. Filming locations include Subic of Zambales province, where a significant portion of the film was shot for forest settings, and San Jose del Monte, Philippines. In preparation for her role, San Pedro worked hard to be fit. Besides working out regularly and controlling her eating portions, she learned how to improve her posture. In an interview, San Pedro mentioned how intense the shooting for the film was. She stated in one interview that she was not feeling well at that time, most likely because she was \\"over-fatigued\\". She added that it was the first time she and other cast members experienced such scenes. During the press conference held in October, she once again reiterated how difficult it was to shoot some scenes, particularly the action scenes. Aguas added he always felt tired after every shooting. For him, it was the two-minute continuous fight scene with his co-actor (Ethan Salvador) that was the most difficult part in the filming. However, both Aguas and San Pedro were satisfied to have portrayed action roles. Aguas noted that working with his female lead was easy as they were already working closely together since they were little. Aguas shared his sentiment about his friendship with San Pedro as he stated that San Pedro is the type of friend who, even though they do not communicate for a long time, stays the same. Celis, another Goin Bulilit alumni added in a separate interview, \\"[t]he original cast of Goin Bulilit do not need to adjust (to be comfortable on set). Whenever they meet, they just enjoy one another's company.\\" =Music= One of the songs featured in the film is titled \\"Laruan\\" by The Roxymorrons. The released Class of 2018 teaser features an eerie version of \\"Itanong Mo Sa Mga Bata\\", originally performed by the 1970s Filipino folk-rock band Asin. Promotion=Marketing= On September 14, 2018, a one-minute teaser was released through T-Rex Entertainment's official Facebook and YouTube accounts. It features the first few verses of the lyrics of the song \\"Itanong Mo Sa Mga Bata\\". With the tag \\"Our lesson for today is SURVIVAL\\", the teaser had a short synopsis: \\"...follows the story of a group of students who were sent to a quarantined military facility after one of their classmates got infected with a yet to be identified virus\\". On October 7, a two-minute trailer was released through the film producer's social media accounts with the tag \\"Study hard. Kill harder\\". Different from the suspense-themed teaser, the trailer focused more on action scenes in which the cast, primarily San Pedro, show off their fighting skills. It is also evident that \\"elements from other end-of-the-world and kill-or-be- killed properties are present\\". A press conference was held by T-Rex Entertainment on October 17, accompanied by a livestream through Instagram. Eight days later, another conference was held at Limbaga 77 Cafe Restaurant. The film premiered on the night of November 6 at the TriNoma Cinemas in Quezon City, and it opened in cinemas the day after on November 7. It is rated R-16 by the MTRCB. The cast had several mall shows and TV guesting soon after to promote their upcoming film. Reception=Critical response= The film received average to favorable reviews from the critics. According to Alwin Ignacio of Abante, it has the \\"semblance of a balance and mix of commercial viability and artistic excellence\\". For Reggee Bonoan of Bandera, its comedy scenes balanced the surprise factor. Francis Cruz of Rappler also agrees, but believes it to be a bit lacking. For him, the film is a \\"hodgepodge\\". He stated: \\"The film is actually entertaining. There are funny bits here and there, with some moments of suspense to balance out the silliness. Some of the scenes manage to be compelling, raising moral quandaries on top of all the political implications. What the film really needs is to edit its ideas, to limit what it wants to do, its stylistic flourishes, and its garish attempts at camp\\". The main cast received mostly satisfactory reviews. According to Jun Nardo of Bandera, Sharlene San Pedro's performance was commendable, particularly her fight scenes. Ricky Calderon of The Freeman added: \\"The cast did a fine job, with special mention to Sharlene who nailed her role to perfection\\". Ignacio agreed, saying she has a screen presence; she achieved in performing her role, whether during fight-scenes, heart-fluttering scenes or drama scenes. Both San Pedro and Fulgar were acting consistently based on their characters' emotions, said Mercado of Wow Showbiz. When Fulgar said one of her lines, Ignacio commented: \\"Anyone who can say with so much aplomb [the lines] truly deserves a round of applause\\". Nash Aguas' good acting performance was already expected; \\"a delight and a natural charmer\\", said Ignacio. Bonoan felt it was somewhat lacking compared to what Aguas did in the series The Good Son. Bonoan added that the director probably did not give him a better impression in the film to avoid him overpowering the other cast members. This supported the claim of Nardo, who said that despite its large number of students, each are given their own spotlight in the film. According to Cruz, the disadvantage is that \\"the result is more like a collage of insignificant stories that only unnecessarily divert drama from the main characters\\". The performance of Kiray Celis, who played the mean girl in the class, was predominantly favored by the critics. While Nardo and Calderon describe her as the \\"scene stealer\\" of the show who does so \\"effortlessly\\", according to the latter, Mercado said many will find her character likable. Bonoan added that although her character is annoying from the start, people will still love her in the end. Ignacio added: \\"she is naturally funny in all her scenes\\".

Richard Nixon won 52 percent of \\"under 30\\" voters in the 1972 U.S. presidential election. As of March 1972, only 22 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 24 identified with the Republican Party. Young Voters for the President was created by public relations consultant Ken Rietz, whose plan for capturing the support of younger voters for the Republican Party in the 1972 presidential election was brought to the attention of the White House by United States Senator Bill Brock. Rietz was subsequently hired as director of the new group, leading a full-time staff of 120 persons, plus what was claimed to be 400,000 volunteers. Pam Powell, a 24 year-old Nixon supporter and the daughter of actor Dick Powell, was retained as chair of the group, becoming its public face. Rietz identified that young voters were enthusiastic about some of Nixon's policies ‚Äì such as ending military conscription ‚Äì but ambivalent about the president himself and he, therefore, embarked on an effort to bridge the gap between the two. Rietz also determined that non-college youth were more likely to support Nixon than college-enrolled youth and that the former group significantly outnumbered the latter. Outreach efforts by Young Voters for the President have been credited with helping Nixon capture 48 percent of 18 to 24 year-old voters, and 52 percent of under 30 voters, in the 1972 presidential contest. Nixon ultimately won that election with roughly 61-percent of the popular vote and 97-percent of the electoral vote. Hunter S. Thompson wrote extensively about Nixon's youth base and was, according to Boston University's Seth Blumenthal, known to have \\"despised them\\".

Thirteen people were killed, including the perpetrator, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and a police officer who was shot multiple times, with the fatal wound accidentally being fired by another officer. Ten to twelve others were injured. Police identified the killer as 28-year-old Ian David Long, a United States Marine Corps veteran.  Events  At approximately 11:20p.m., a gunman armed with a legally purchased .45-caliber Glock 21 semi-automatic pistol with a laser sight and seven banned high-capacity magazines shot a security guard standing outside the building. He then went inside and shot other guards and employees before moving to shoot patrons inside the bar, firing a total of approximately 60 rounds and throwing smoke bombs. Witnesses described the gunman as a heavily tattooed white male dressed entirely in black. With more than 200 patrons inside, the bar was hosting a regularly scheduled College Country Night event and was popular among students in the area, especially those from Pepperdine University, California Lutheran University, California State University Channel Islands, and Moorpark College. Three minutes after the first 9-1-1 calls, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus and two California Highway Patrol officers arrived at the scene. Hearing gunshots coming from the building, Helus and a California Highway Patrol officer ran inside and immediately came under fire. In the ensuing gunfight, Helus was shot five times by the shooter who used a flashlight with a laser sight on his pistol in the large, darkened, smoke- filled room. Positioned between a Highway Patrol officer and the gunman, Helus was also accidentally struck by a bullet from the officer's rifle that went through his heart and fatally wounded him. Moments later responding Ventura County Sheriff's deputies, who were securing the perimeter, located and evacuated Helus to safety outside. A SWAT team and other police officers arrived on the scene shortly afterwards. After officers entered the building, the gunman was found dead in the kitchen area from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Department of Homeland Security were deployed to further investigate the scene along with EMTs and paramedics from the Ventura County Fire Department and AMR to assist victims. During the shooting, the gunman made several posts on Instagram expressing his thoughts.  Victims  Nine men and three women died during the shooting. Seven were college students, and one other a recent graduate. The four others killed were 54-year-old Helus; a 48-year-old bouncer; a 33-year-old Marine Corps veteran; and a 27-year-old Navy veteran who was at the 2017 Las Vegas shooting during the Route 91 Harvest music festival. They all died from multiple gunshots, and one victim was also stabbed in the neck. Ten to twelve others were injured, only one by gunfire.  Perpetrator  Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean identified the gunman as 28-year-old Ian David Long, a resident of nearby Newbury Park. His gun was reportedly purchased legally. Long served in the United States Marine Corps from August 2008 to March 2013, and had gone to Afghanistan from November 2010 to June 2011. After being discharged, he attended California State University, Northridge as an athletic training major from 2013 to 2016, but he did not graduate. While he was previously living with roommates in Reseda, Long was living with his mother at the time of the shooting. A cousin told the media that Long's father had died from cancer early in his life. His friends say that Long had been at the bar with them and some considered him a regular patron. Police and a mental health crisis team visited Long in 2017 for his irate and irrational behavior, but they decided not to detain him at a psychiatric facility. A high school teacher raised claims that Long had physically assaulted her as a student but was encouraged not to push the incident so as to not endanger his future in the Marine Corps. In her statement, the teacher alleged that Long had issues long before his military service. Although he had served overseas in the military, behavioral scientist and clinical psychologist Lisa Jaycox said that it was premature to say whether Long suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder or if it was a factor in the shooting.  Aftermath  Within 24 hours of the shooting, the Woolsey Fire forced the evacuation of many people in the area, including several survivors. The mother of a victim who died in the Thousand Oaks shooting after surviving the 2017 Las Vegas shooting called for gun control legislation from legislators despite the high-capacity magazine used by the gunman already being made illegal in California. https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/1928201002 The only gun store in the town told reporters that there was an increase in individuals looking to purchase a weapon for protection on the day after the shooting. On November 15, 2018, the funeral for Helus was held. Law enforcement officers, local and state leaders including California Governor Jerry Brown and Governor-Elect Gavin Newsom, as well as local citizens attended his funeral. A vigil at Calvary Community Church in nearby Westlake Village, for two of their congregation, was attended by around 500 mourners. Numerous national sports teams highlighted the victims and donated money to those affected by the shooting. Victims were provided with these donations immediately after the shooting. Each victim's family was provided with $20,000 for burial costs. After a third distribution in March 2019, a total of $3.6 million had been contributed by more than 25,000 people and through more than 200 fundraisers. The funds were distributed to the families of victims, those physically injured, and others present in the establishment. A local foundation received and distributed the funds in a cooperative effort without charging any administrative fees. Susan Orfanos, whose son was killed in the shooting, meets with Julia Brownley and Dianne Feinstein about gun violence in 2020. The Ventura county Board of Supervisors formed the Task Force on Mental Health & Safety in response to the shooting. Initially composed of key county officials, the ongoing task force looks for gaps in the systems that protect the public and that provide mental health care and makes recommendations on how to prevent and lessen the damage from mass shootings. A memorial will be constructed in a community park. The owners of Borderline Bar & Grill have stated that they plan to renovate and re-open the location. They have also opened a second location in Agoura Hills, California called BL Dancehall & Saloon.

It was designed by H. E. Ross & Rowe and built from 1924 to 1925 by A. C. Lewis Constructions (Concrete Constructions). It is also known as part address 122-142 Gloucester Street (Bushell's). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The land that was to become the site of the Bushells building formed part of a locale known as Frog Hollow, and area of simple terraces and cottages. The suggestion of a watercourse in the early plans may explain the nickname, which appears to be given to many marshy localities in Sydney and other towns in Australia. From the vicinity of the intersection of Grosvenor and Cumberland Streets originated a small creek, which flowed across the northwest corner of \\"Frog Hollow\\". In photographs held in Health Department Record there is a record of the appearance of the simple terraces and cottages on the site, including a row skewed across the land on a northeast‚Äìsouthwest line. These were just the sort of development the government was anxious to replace. As a locality it was known for its absentee ownership, slum rental dwellings, poor drainage and lingering stench. Following the outbreak of the Bubonic plague in 1900, these buildings were demolished by the Rocks Resumption Board and subsequently by the Sydney Harbour Trust. A major redevelopment of the entire area was undertaken. St Patrick's Church and School were able to expand its site and the State Clothing Factory was developed in 1909 between the Bushells site and the Church lands, Harrington Street was realigned at its junction with Essex Street. Attempts to auction some of the Resumption Lands on a leasehold basis in 1905 were unsuccessful. =Acquisition by Bushells= The Harrington Street site appears to have been acquired by Bushells Tea Company with the building subsequently completed and occupied by 1924‚Äì25. The company acquired the site from the Sunday Times Newspaper Company, which had purchased it the previous year from the Housing Board of NSW. Sydney City Council Archives record Building Application No.136/23 of 15 the February 1923 in respect to a warehouse at this site. Apart from minor changes, the building was to remain virtually unaltered while P. H. Bushell remained in charge of the business. Changes were made to plant, equipment and servicing, but not to the essential placement of functions within the building. With sale of the building to the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority and the subsequent departure of the company to its new premises at Concord in 1975, the building was vacated. In 1990 the building was occupied as site offices during construction of a nearby commercial project on a site within the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority's area. The first level above basement, above Harrington Street but below Gloucester Street, was appropriated as the principal offices with some temporary amenities and associated plumbing introduced, while two further levels above were partitioned off, had further toilet areas added. In November 1998 the a 99-year lease for the property was assigned to a private company by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority, with development consent for refurbishment for its use as offices, in accordance with the requirements of the Conservation Plan. Work commenced on this refurbishment in late 1999. The adaptive reuse of the building and retention of significant fabric won four awards in 2002. The Bushells Building was constructed in 1923‚Äì1925 on the site of \\"Frog Hollow\\", a collection of domestic buildings dating to the 1820s and demolished as part of the Resumptions in 1900. Bushells remained on the site until 1975.  Description  The building is a seven-storey structure, comprising a basement with six levels above. At basement level the building covers the whole of its site, while from the level immediately above the basement its plan is indented by light wells to the north and south elevations, much the larger of these being the south well. The building uses a typical form of construction for its medium rise, warehouse type and for its date; load-bearing brick perimeter walls, pierced by many window openings, enclose an internal timber frame of heavy but not massive scantlings, which is further stabilised by the two brick-walled, reinforced concrete stair towers, to the eastern and western sides.Moore 1991: 9 and also 9-27 Storeys: Seven; Facade: Load bearing bonded brickwork. Roof Cladding: Galvanised iron. Floor Frame: Timber/Reinforced concrete. Lifts: Wooden-framed tea chest elevator; steel-framed chest elevator; passenger and good lifts. = Condition = As at 3 November 1999, the building was in good condition considering its age, constituent materials, construction method, and the virtual absence of protective maintenance for almost 20 years.Moore 1991: 24-27 Extensive work for the adaptive reuse of the building was undertaken in 1999, involving conservation and maintenance work. Much of the archaeology which demonstrates the former use by Bushells Tea Ltd. and the processes involved have been retained. The adaptive reuse won four awards in 2002. Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Although the building has basements on the Gloucester St frontage, photographs from show a retaining wall some up to Gloucester Street, earlier structures being level with Harrington Street. Therefore, possibly well preserved remains.

The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Bushells Building is of heritage significance for its associations with a prominent and important Australian business enterprise, maker of a nationally ubiquitous staple food product (tea), and whose principal, P. H. Bushell, is notable for his contributions to Australian commerce, social life and philanthropy in the 20th century. With its occupancy and as an important source of employment for Rocks residents over 50 years, the building remains a physical and social landmark within the historic fabric of The Rocks, providing evidence of the area's later development after the Plague clearances and before modern redevelopment activities. The building's contribution to the streetscape of Harrington and Gloucester Streets is significant in the recognised important townscape character of both those streets. The building still displays its ability to illustrate its designed purpose and use for Bushells, through its retention of a significant amount of the original tea-making equipment, and is of interest for both its design and construction techniques, all of which would appear to be compatible with adaptive re-use.Moore 1991: 86 Bushells Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. First and foremost the building was built for and occupied by one of the most high-profile Australian food manufacturers, maker of some of the most popular and ubiquitous brand-name staple products in the nation. In addition to the associational value of that link, the building and its contents provide direct evidence of the operations of that Company and of the attitudes and approach of its principal figure. The building's location and occupation in The Rocks provide further evidence of the historical development of the area, across the 20th century.Moore 1991: 81-82 The historic significance of the building is derived from its historic associations, architectural historical value, industrial archaeological value and social historical value. The Bushells building has historic associations with the archetypal Australian food manufacturer whose brand name has become a national identity. The buildings location and occupation in The Rocks provides further evidence of the historical development of the area. In terms of architectural value the building is significant for its associations with the prominent architects of commercial buildings of the day, H. E. Ross and Rowe. The building is of a simple 19th Century utilitarian warehouse style dressed in a Classical styling to the main facades. The building is similar to a number of industrial building built at the same time, however many warehouses have been lost to redevelopment in Sydney. The Bushells building provides a rare example of a warehouse that has remained unusually intact in it original ownership and with its original intended use. Its timber construction is a remnant of 19th century building technique, which was soon to become less common with the introduction of more economical reinforced concrete frame. The industrial archaeological value is derived from the buildings capacity to illustrate the former function for which it was built and which it served to house for over fifty years. The main elements of industrial archaeological value are found in the modest evidence of former packing line activities seen in the buildings floors and in the extensive evidence of the materials handling methods, as shown in the loading and receiving docks, the horizontal conveyor, the lifts and chutes and especially the two purpose built tea chest elevators (which would be the buildings most significant artefacts). An understanding of the social historical value of the Bushells building can still be gained through its special remnant qualities, which can demonstrate the attitudes and approaches to the workplace throughout its history. The interpretation of the social value may be possible through the conservation of the unique fabric, particularly the surviving signage inside the building and historical signage. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Bushells building is of cultural significance for its association with a prominent and important business enterprise, maker of a nationally ubiquitous staple food product, tea, and whose principal, P. H. Bushell, is notable for his contributions to Australian commerce, social life and philanthropy in the 20th century. The company was an important source of employment for Rocks residents over 50 years, the building remains a physical and social landmark with the historic fabric of the Rocks, providing evidence of the area's later development after the plague clearances and before modern redevelopment activities. The building's contribution to the streetscape of Harrington and Gloucester Streets is significant in the recognised important townscape character of both those streets. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The building's simple, massive form, coupled with all its material characteristics which identify it as \\"an old building\\" is distinctive within its context and appreciable from many viewpoints in The Rocks vicinity; the interiors or the building together with its massive timber framing are very impressive and almost universally encourage discussion of what new use might be made of them. Parts of the surviving equipment have an abstract quality and they make to the impression that the building's interiors give, of a former working industrial warehouse/factory.Moore 1991: 81 The aesthetic significance of the building is clear in that it is a distinctive landmark building in the context of the Rocks. Its simple massive form is impressive and is complemented by the industrial warehouse spaces of the interior, which are large, will lit open expanses with expressive timber framing. The surviving equipment provides a unique sculptural quality and contributes to the interpretation and understanding of the former industrial warehouse. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building had landmark status as one of the commercial institutions of the Rocks, and the Company enjoyed community and employee regard as a benevolent employer. Bushells as a Company retains symbolically Australian connotations despite offshore ownership, and the place held by the building, particularly with its prominent signage on the north wall, in the collective imagination of Sydney could be easily underestimated.Moore, 1991: 84. Attempts to gain an understanding of the social value (contemporary, community esteem) of the Bushells building would be difficult. However, Bushells has become a symbolically Australian name, arousing a sense of nostalgia in the general community. This may be gained particularly from the prominent signage on the exterior of the building. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The principles capacities of the Bushells Building to inform must lie within the historical and archaeological information that its fabric retains and displays, although there may be some interest in the physical performance of its components parts and structure.Moore 1991: 84 The building is similar to a number of industrial building built at the same time, however many warehouses have been lost to redevelopment in Sydney. The Bushells building provides a rare example of a warehouse that has remained unusually intact in it original ownership and with its original intended use.

The industrial archaeological value is derived from the buildings capacity to illustrate the former function for which it was built and which it served to house for over fifty years. The main elements of industrial archaeological value are found in the modest evidence of former packing line activities seen in the buildings floors and in the extensive evidence of the materials handling methods, as shown in the loading and receiving docks, the horizontal conveyor, the lifts and chutes and especially the two purpose built tea chest elevators (which would be the buildings most significant artefacts). The surviving archaeological objects; tea chest lifts, chutes and tea mixing hopper provide intriguing and powerful three dimensional artefacts of the past process of tea manufacture. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Bushells building is a landmark within The Rocks historic area. The building is important for its industrial character and its historical association with the Bushells company. The building is important as it maintained the same use for the same company from 1923 to 1975 and retains many of its industrial manufacturing features. The building is important in the understanding of the development of local industry in Sydney, it contains rare evidence that all forms of manufacture and food production once occurred with the industrial fringe of Sydney's central business district.

The album was released on September 14, 2018 via Blue Note label, containing both studio and live recordings. Emanon was initially a physical-only release available in two versions‚Äîa Standard Edition that includes three CDs with the graphic novel, and a Deluxe Edition that packages three vinyl LPs and three CDs with the graphic novel enclosed in a hardcover slipcase. As on January 26, 2019, the album had been added to streaming service Spotify. Background \\"Emanon\\" is a title taken from a Dizzy Gillespie and Milton Shaw composition \\"Noname\\" spelled backward. The album is Shorter‚Äôs first in five years. The set is accompanied by a 74-page graphic novel created by Shorter together with writer Monica Sly and artist Randy DuBurke, whose career includes work for DC Comics. The book is a futuristic fantasy supported by Shorter‚Äôs philosophy of art. It tells the story of a ‚Äúrogue philosopher‚Äù named Emanon who travels among worlds, spreading a message of truth and empowerment and fighting against the powers of evil. In his biography Shorter, a practicing Buddhist, explained \\"At this point I‚Äôm looking to express eternity in composition\\". Recording Disc 1 was recorded in New York City and Casco Viejo, Panama in 2016 and features the Shorter‚Äôs quartet in a studio session with the 34-piece Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Discs 2 and 3 were recorded live in the Barbican Centre, London, as a follow-up project of his previous album Without a Net. Wayne Shorter and Don Was produced the release. Reception At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on nine reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Larry Blumenfeld of The Wall Street Journal stated \\"Mr. Shorter‚Äôs music has always demanded alternate routes and suggested parallel worlds‚Äîit implies a multiverse of sorts. This package frames such ideas with splendor, elevating his stature in unexpected ways\\". Chris Pearson of The Times wrote \\"By now we should have learnt to trust Wayne Shorter, the great saxophonist whose credits stretch back to Miles Davis and Weather Report. Still, one trembles at the prospect of his latest project, a triple orchestral album swimming in armchair philosophy, cod sociology and sci-fi and accompanied by a comic book. It sounds barmy and boring, but wait ‚Äî come back. It‚Äôs actually brilliantly beautiful\\". John Fordham of The Guardian added \\"If newcomers discover Shorter via this luxurious multimedia package, then Emanon will have done its job ‚Äì but the music here is all that it really takes\\". John Garratt of PopMatters noted \\"We can't go handing great reviews to Wayne Shorter just because he's Wayne Shorter; he has to prove that he can deliver the goods all over again.

No. 86 was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon; and both buildings were built from 1886 to 1912. It is also known as the Old Bushells Factory and Warehouse; Bushells Place; Bushells Warehouse and Bushells Offices; and Health Commission Building (Bushell's). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In 1788 the subject site was leased to Captain Henry Waterhouse, in 1800 Robert Campbell took over the lease. There was no substantial building on the site in the first half of the 19th century because of its steep and rocky nature. In 1877 Robert Campbells land and wharfage facilities were sold to the Australasian Steam Navigation Company, (ASN Coy) the subject site may have been used as a rock quarry. Shortly after the ASN Coy purchased the land it was sold to Cliff and Clark who erected a number of small stores. They may not have lasted long on the land as the 1880 Percy Dove plans shows the site to be vacant. The first building, No. 88, was built in 1886 by Virgoe Son and Chapman, Importers and Merchants. Originally of three floors and basement, No. 88 is a fine example of the late Victorian Free Classical style. In 1904 Bushells Ltd., tea merchants, leased the building. In 1912 a taller brick building of six floors and basement was completed on the adjacent northern site. The new warehouse (No. 86) was designed by W. L. Vernon, the Government Architect, in the Federation Warehouse style, and built by the Public Works Department. Concurrently, the building at No. 88, was reduced in depth by 10 metres to make way for the construction of Hickson Road, and an extra floor was added. Vernon designed the reconstructed eastern fa√ßade (No. 88) to harmonize with its new neighbour (No. 86), while the western elevation of the extra storey retained the style of its lower levels. The two buildings were interconnected to accommodate Bushells, the single occupant. Bushells later vacated the premises, and from 1924 the buildings were used as stores for the Departments of Education and Labour and Industry. Following renovation between 1948-1951, the premises were used as offices and laboratories by Government Departments, mainly by the Department of Public Health.SCRA, 1982: CC 03/04SCRA, Annual Report, 1985: 10, 18 A new plaza was created at the corner of George Street and Hickson Road in 1976-77, with the help of a donation from the Bushells Group of Companies, in recognition of its long association with The Rocks. A commemorative plaque was unveiled on 26 January 1977.SCRA, Annual Reports, 1976-77 The Health Commission of NSW vacated the building in 1980. During 1984-85, work was undertaken to adapt the building for commercial offices, with shops, cafe and gallery at ground level. Two additional floors were provided on the upper levels of 88 George Street, and the southern facade of this building was treated architecturally to be in sympathy with the eastern facade. Both buildings were structurally strengthened during the work. The caf√© has outdoor seating on Bushells Place. Access to car parking for No. 88 George Street is under Bushells Place from Hickson Road. In 2007-2008, the buildings at 86-88 George Street were refurbished and the building services upgraded, for continuing commercial uses. The works included reconfiguration of some basement areas; reconfiguration of layout, entry foyer and retail areas on the ground floor (including removal of ground floor toilets from 88 George Street); refurbishment of toilets (except on third floor); lift upgrade; upgrade of fire stairs; rooftop works; new environmental control systems; redesign of Bushells Place; new external colour scheme; and implementation of some heritage interpretation strategies. The works, based on environmental efficiency principles, achieved a 5-Star Green Star Office Design rating (Green Building Council Australia) for 86-88 George Street, the first for a heritage-listed office building in NSW.Design 5 Architects, Revised CMP, 2008  Description  No. 88 is in the Victorian Free Classical style with a decorative plaster painted finish. No. 86 is in the Federation Warehouse style, with traditional face brickwork, stone lintels and string courses. Vernon remodelled the eastern fa√ßade of No. 88 to aesthetically harmonise with the new building at No. 86. No. 86 was designed to be used by Bushells in conjunction with the earlier building (No. 88). Floor levels were common between ground and third floors with load bearing brick external structure on sandstone bedrock. The internal structure was generally of heavy timber floors (with some concrete in service areas) on various combinations of steel I-beams, large hardwood beams and steel, cast iron and hardwood storey post columns. The additional floors gave a strong visual link between the buildings through the use of matching brickwork, and the continuation of the piers, parapet and window treatment to No 86.SCRA, Annual Report, 1985: 18-21 The building was one of the earliest in Sydney to employ a steel frame, the steel being supplied by Dorman Long & Co of Britain who would later build the Sydney Harbour Bridge. *Style: No. 86: Federation Warehouse; No. 88: Late Victorian Free Classical; *Storeys: No. 86: 7 floors; No. 88: 5 floors; *Roof Cladding: pitched / flat roof; *Internal Structure: heavy timber floors on various combination of beams and steel, cast iron. = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Destroyed?

The work included a new concrete stairway, some concrete flooring (but a large proportion of the original wooden floors were retained) and an electric lift was installed. *During 1984-5, a comprehensive renovation and restoration program was undertaken to update the buildings for use as commercial offices. Two additional floors were provided on the upper levels of 88 George Street, and the southern facade of this building was treated architecturally to be in sympathy with the eastern facade. Both buildings were structurally strengthened during the work.SCRA, Annual Report, 1984:10SCRA, Annual Report, 1985:18-19 *2007 - Complete refurbishment of the building. The works will include: **Installing a new lift **Refurbishing each floor to premium-grade heritage commercial offices and retail space **Upgrading fire protection, electrical, air-conditioning and other services **Improving access and services for people with disabilities **Creating a new public space outside the building to improve access and revitalise the area. *The works were done with a view to sustainability and The Green Building Council of Australia has awarded the building a 5-Star Green Star Office Design rating the first time the rating has been awarded to a State heritage-listed office building. = Further information = The building is the first heritage building to be awarded a 5 Star Green Star Office Design by the Green Building Council of Australia.  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, the Bushells Warehouse, Bushells Place and site are of State heritage significance for their aesthetic, and historical values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The warehouse at No. 88 George Street (1886) and the interconnected warehouse at No. 86 (1912) are closely associated with the mercantile activities of The Rocks, and in particular the Bushells Tea company. No. 86 George Street was built for and 86-88 George Street occupied by one of the most high profile archetypically Australian food manufacturers, The Bushells Tea Company. The building provides direct evidence of the operations of that Company. The warehouse at No. 88 George Street (1886) and the interconnected warehouse at No. 86 (1912) are closely associated with the mercantile activities of The Rocks. No. 88 is a representative but altered example of the late Victorian Free Classical style. No. 86, designed by the Government Architect, W. L. Vernon, is a representative example of the Federation Warehouse style. Vernon designed the additional floor and remodelled eastern fa√ßade of No. 88 to harmonize with his design at No. 86. No. 86, was one of the first buildings in Sydney to employ a steel frame, allowing for larger interior spaces. The steel was supplied by Dorman Long & Co of Britain, who would later go on to construct the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The two buildings, located at the junction of George Street and Hickson Road, have an important landmark and streetscape quality, particularly when approached from the east along George Street. The use of the building fa√ßade for the Bushells signage up until the 1980s has given it significance as an important historic landmark. Undoubtedly, the building had landmark status as one of the most prominent commercial institutions of The Rocks and Bushells enjoyed community and employee regard as a benevolent employer. The massive scale of Bushells compared to its neighbours makes the building distinctive in its setting and in the townscape image of The Rocks. The adaptive reuse of the building completed in 2007 has been rated Australia's most sustainably designed State heritage-listed office building. The Green Building Council of Australia has awarded the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority project a 5-Star Green Star Office Design rating - the first time the rating has been awarded to a State heritage-listed office building. Old Bushells Factory was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The warehouse at No. 88 George Street (1886) and the interconnected warehouse at No. 86 (1912) are closely associated with the mercantile activities of The Rocks, and in particular the Bushells Tea company. 86 George Street was modified and 88 George Street was built and occupied by one of the most high profile archetypically Australian food manufacturers, maker of some of the most popular and ubiquitous brand name staple products in the nation. In addition to the associational value of that link, the building and evidence of former signage provide direct evidence to the operations of that Company. By extension, this provides evidence of the attitudes and approach of its principal figure, an eminent Australian of individual renown and historic interest for his contribution to both Australian society and commerce. The building's location and occupation in The Rocks provide further evidence of the historical development of the area, across the 20th Century. It provides clear evidence of its changing fabric, and its changes in function as a sub-set of the city. The building characterises the very special urban functions of The Rocks as a waterfront/ manufacturing/ processing area, which co-existed with its residential population. In particular, the site of 86-88 George Street was one of the named locations identified at the time of the plague outbreaks and imbued with notoriety by the public officials anxious to pursue a broader range of objectives than slum clearance and civic improvement. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The combined warehouse at No. 86-88 George Street and Bushells Place has associations with Bushells Tea Company. No. 86 George Street and the third floor and Hickson Road fa√ßade of 88 George Street has associations with the Government Architect W. L. Vernon. The building at No. 86 is associated with Dorman Long & Co, builders of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, they supplied the steel for the structural frame of the building. Steel framed buildings were a fairly new technology in 1912 in Australia and this building is one of the first in Sydney to employ it. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The warehouse at No. 88 is a representative example of the late Victorian Free Classical style. No. 86, designed by the Government Architect, W. L. Vernon, is a representative example of the Federation Warehouse style. Vernon specifically designed the additional floor and remodelled eastern fa√ßade of No. 88 to harmonise with his design at No. 86. The two prominent warehouses, located at the junction of George Street and Hickson Road, have an important landmark and streetscape quality, particularly when approached from the east along George Street. No. 86 is one of the first structural steel framed buildings constructed in Sydney. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The inclusion of the Buildings on the registers of the National Trust and (now defunct) Register of the National Estate demonstrate the esteem that they are held in by the wider community. Bushells enjoyed community and employee regard as a benevolent employer. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The refurbishment undergone in 2007 has given the building rarity value as being the first Heritage Building to be awarded a 5 Star Green rating. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The warehouse at No. 88 is a representative example of the late Victorian Free Classical style. No. 86, designed by the Government Architect, W. L. Vernon, is a representative example of the Federation Warehouse style.

He was the first Dean of Faculty at the nascent United States Air Force Academy. Early life Don Zabriskie Zimmerman was born in Eugene, Oregon, on 25 November 1903, the youngest of four children of John Wilbur Zimmerman, a comptroller at a lumber company, and his wife Zilpha Zula Zabriskie, a teacher. He attended Eugene High School, and entered the University of Oregon when he was 15. During his freshman year he was a mathematics major, but switched to geology as a sophomore. He played baseball and was the left fielder and captain of the university team in his senior year. His ability attracted baseball talent scouts, and he received offers from two Major League Baseball and two Pacific Coast League teams, but turned down the offers. After graduating with his bachelor of science after four years, Zimmerman pursued a master's degree in geology, and was a graduate assistant in geology at an annual salary of $500 in his fifth and sixth years at the university. He became a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and was involved in the ROTC, commanding the ROTC regiment as a cadet colonel during his sixth year. This led to an offer of a Regular Army commission, but he turned it down too, accepting a reserve commission in the infantry. Instead, he sought to secure a graduate scholarship in petrography at an eastern university, but when this fell through, he decided to accept an offer of an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, from Senator Robert N. Stanfield. Zimmerman entered West Point on 14 July 1925. He played basketball and baseball every year, and was captain of the baseball team in his final year. He was also a substitute fullback on the football team in his final two years. He was a member of the cadet choir, taught Sunday school, and qualified as an expert marksman with the rifle and pistol. He was a color corporal and a company commander, and was a \\"distinguished cadet\\", one with an average grade of 92 or more. He was class president in each of his last three years. The class yearbook described him as \\"the most popular man of his class\\". During his senior year, he visited Langley Field, Virginia, where he was impressed by the adjutant, Colonel James F. Doherty's, advocacy of an independent air force. He was also impressed by the colonel's daughter Marion. Early career Ranked sixth in his class of 299, Zimmerman graduated from West Point on 13 June 1929, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, as was normal for high-ranking graduates. However, he was detailed to the United States Army Air Corps on 12 September 1929, and two days later became a student at the Air Corps Primary Flying School at March Field, California. He then attended the Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, Texas, from which he graduated with his wings on 11 June 1930. He was formally transferred to the Air Corps on 11 December 1930, and was posted to Luke Field, Hawaii. In July 1931, while practising dive bombing in a Thomas-Morse O-19, a biplane that was the first Air Corps aircraft with a metal fuselage, he failed to pull out in time, and the aircraft struck the ground. Observers saw it somersault three times before coming to a halt right-side up. The landing gear had sheared off and the engine was later found away. They expected to find Zimmerman in a similar condition, but he had suffered only a few cuts and bruises and a broken leg. The accident permanently deepened his voice, and soon after his hair began turning white. Zimmerman married Marion Elizabeth Doherty in Manila on 15 July 1932. They had three children, two sons and a daughter. He returned to the United States on 26 February 1934, and was posted to Crissy Field, California, where he was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 October 1934, and became a student officer at the California Institute of Technology, once again pursuing a master's degree, but this time a Master of Arts in meteorology. His teachers included Sverre Petterssen, a Norwegian meteorologist whose theories of atmospheric circulation revolutionized weather forecasting. Zimmerman became an enthusiastic adherent. He obtained his master's degree under the supervision of Irving P. Krick, and became the post weather officer at Randolph Field, Texas. Considering the manuals on weather forecasting out of date, he and First Lieutenant Thomas S. Moorman wrote a new Weather Manual for Pilots based on Petterssen's teachings. He was promoted to captain on 13 June 1939.  World War II  On 1 July 1940, Zimmerman became a mathematics instructor at West Point. He returned to the California Institute of Technology on 1 February 1942 on a mission from the Chief of the Army Air Forces, Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold. A report had reached the War Department that the German invasion of Poland had been made possible by a weather forecast of unseasonably dry weather. Zimmerman was sent to discover if such accurate long-range weather forecasting was possible. He reported that it was not. He was promoted to major on 15 March 1941, lieutenant colonel on 1 February 1942, and colonel on 1 March 1942. He was the Director of Weather on the War Department General Staff from 8 February 1942 until 1 December 1942. He then attended the shortened wartime course at the Army's Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas from 1 December to 30 January 1943, after which he commanded the 21st Bombardment Group at MacDill Field, Florida, until 4 June 1943. He was in the first class of the Army‚ÄìNavy Staff College that had been created by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1943, which he attended from 5 June to 14 October 1943. Having completed this course, Zimmerman's next assignment was with the joint planning staff of the V Amphibious Corps in the Central Pacific. In this role he was involved in the planning for Operation Flintlock, the capture of the Marshall Islands. He was aware of Charles Darwin's general theory on the evolution of coral reefs and atolls, as expounded in The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, from the 1840s, but believed that it was not an absolute predictor of the slope off lagoon shores in all cases. He built on Darwin's work with his own published paper on coral reef development, which divided atolls into 3 age strata, with different characteristics. The differences were crucial to the success of the operation, because the slopes off the lagoon shores of the Marshalls were steeper than forecast by a strict reading of Darwin's 19th century general work, and the lagoon was deep enough for LSTs to enter to discharge tanks directly onto the beach, which Zimmerman confirmed by going ashore with the 4th Marine Division. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for this service. He returned to Washington, D.C., where he served with the Operations Division of the War Department General Staff from 5 June 1944 to 30 June 1945, returning to the Pacific to serve at the Guam-based headquarters of the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, for which he was awarded a second Legion of Merit. Later life After the war, Zimmerman served in the Office of the Secretary of War until 28 March 1946. He was a student at the Imperial Defence College in the UK from 1 April 1946 to 20 December 1946, and then returned to Washington for another tour of duty on the War Department General Staff. With the creation of the United States Air Force as a separate service, he transferred to it as a colonel on 12 April 1948. After the outbreak of the Korean War he went to the Headquarters Far East Air Forces, first as its director of Plans, Programs and Policy, and then as deputy for Intelligence until after the fighting ended in 1953. He became a brigadier general, and was awarded two more Legions of Merit and the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. On 22 July 1954, Zimmerman became the first Dean of Faculty at the nascent United States Air Force Academy. As such, Zimmerman was responsible for the selection of teaching staff and development of the curriculum. He gave it a different orientation from West Point, with as many classroom hours devoted to the humanities and social studies as to scientific subjects. He then returned to the Pentagon as Air Force deputy director of Development Planning. In 1958 he became assistant for Foreign Developments to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Development. Zimmerman retired from the Air Force in 1958, and became a consultant for Boeing. He died on 11 May 1983, and was buried at the United States Air Force Academy Cemetery.

Completed and lit in 1896, it is one of the oldest working lighthouses in the Philippines as well as the best preserved lighthouse in the country. It serves as a guide for ships passing through the Verde Island Passage going to either Batangas Bay or Sibuyan Sea. History The lighthouse in 1903. One of the two historical markers installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines on the site in 2007 stating that it was designated a National Historical Landmark in 2006. The Malabrigo Point Lighthouse was among the lighthouses constructed by the Spanish colonial authorities in the Philippines from 1846 to 1896 as part of the Plan General de Alumbrado de Maritimo de las Costas del Archipelago de Filipino (Masterplan for the Lighting of the Maritime Coasts of the Philippine Archipelago), the goal of which was to install 55 lighthouses all over the archipelago, including its remotest corners. At the time, Malabrigo Point was considered a dangerous area among seafarers because of its rocky coastline and strong currents especially during the monsoon season, hence, its name which comes from the Spanish words mal abrigo, meaning \\"bad shelter.\\" In 1891, Spanish engineer Guillermo Brockman, who also designed the lighthouses at Capul Island and San Bernardino Island, created a design for a lighthouse in Punta Malabrigo which consisted of a Victorian architecture- inspired cylindrical brick tower with a metal staircase and double balcony, lighthouse keeper's quarters, and machine room. The company of Chinese contractor Jose Garcia constructed the lighthouse out of brick and lime cement and completed it in 1896, with the lighthouse being lit for the first time on October 1, 1896.From the inscription on the historical marker installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines on the site on November 27, 2006 After the American annexation of the Philippines in 1898, the management of the Spanish-built lighthouses in the country fell into American hands. From 1900 to 1902 ‚Äî the height of the Philippine-American War ‚Äî the American gunboat USS Villalobos, a former Spanish gunboat captured after the American annexation of the Philippines, guarded the lighthouse. The gunboat regularly patrolled the area around the lighthouses at Cape Santiago, Malabrigo Point and Cabra Island from its base in Cavite, maintaining a communication link with the Marines guarding lighthouses and keeping a sharp lookout for smuggling and trafficking of supplies to Filipino revolutionaries. During World War II, the top of the lighthouse was damaged by machine gun fire from advancing American forces who thought it was being used as a Japanese garrison. After the war, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and the Department of Public Works and Highways repaired the lighthouse. In 1980, the lighthouse was automated following the replacement of its damaged lens with a light bulb donated by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The bulb has since been replaced with a modern, solar-powered halogen light purchased through a loan grant by JICA and installed by the PCG in 1994. In 2004, Olympic swimmer Akiko Thomson formed the nonprofit group Friends of Malabrigo, which signed an agreement with the PCG allowing them to develop and preserve the lighthouse into a sports and ecotourism site where youth swimming and sailing competitions as well as ecological and tourism-related activities will be held. However, these plans did not materialize. On November 27, 2006, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines installed two historical markers in Filipino and English, designating it a National Historical Landmark. The municipality of Lobo, where the lighthouse is located, signed an agreement with the PCG to adopt the lighthouse in 2014 and began renovating and repainting the structure, and has since become the best preserved lighthouse in the country. In 2016, the PCG named its second Parola-class patrol vessel BRP Malabrigo after the lighthouse. In popular media The Malabrigo Point Lighthouse has been the site of filming for a number of Filipino movies and televisions shows, including the 1975 film Ibong Lukaret starring Vilma Santos and the 2018 ABS-CBN afternoon soap opera Precious Hearts Romances Presents: Araw Gabi starring JM De Guzman and Barbie Imperial. In 2006, a film crew that conducted an unauthorized shoot caused minor damage to the lighthouse, leading the NHCP to declare it a National Historical Landmark to protect the site. The PCG and the local government now prohibits filming within the site without a permit from the Mayor's Office.

Site resumed in 1900‚Äì1902 and 30 buildings demolished by 1915. Engineering works here from 1917‚Äì. Vacant till 1994. =Historical summary= The archaeological site comprises sections of two city blocks originally granted in the 1830s and 1840s as Sections 74 and 75 of the town of Sydney. Historical research indicates that the site has been occupied by Europeans from at least as early as c.1795. During the 1790s and the early part of the nineteenth century it became a focus for settlement for convicts and ex-convicts. It had a rich subsequent history characterised by progressive intensification of occupation during the nineteenth century. Following large scale resumption and clearing by the government between 1902 and 1915, the site has also been used for various light industrial and public utility purposes. It has remained undeveloped since the 1950s, when a concrete slab was laid as the pavement for a bus depot. Since 1972, the site has been in the property of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority and its successor the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority. The site was subject to archaeological excavation in 1994. =Thematic history=Aboriginal cultures and interactions with other cultures The Rocks area, including the archaeological site, was witness to some of the very first encounters between the traditional owners, the Cadigal people, and the newly arrived settlers of the first and later second fleets. There was likely a period of a number of years, a transition, when both cultures lived close by each other and continued to occupy the same locale. Physical evidence collected during the large excavation of the site in 1994 included at least one piece of post-1790 porcelain which had been expertly flaked by Aboriginal people, presumably for use as a useful tool. Convicts, migrants and housing The Rocks area was within the town site most often associated with the early convict history of Sydney. Many convicts and emancipists lived in and around The Rocks, including on the subject site. The place was home and work for many convicts and their presence was indelibly marked on the neighbourhood. The convict butcher George Cribb, who arrived in 1808 on board the transport Admiral Gambier lived on the subject site until the later 1820s and is remembered by the naming of the lane joining Cumberland and Gloucester Streets which bordered his pub, house and butcher shop, Cribbs Lane. Other convict families, such as Ann Armsden and her First Fleet husband George Legg lived across the lane from Cribb in a large stone house, built on top of and partially into the natural sandstone that gave the area its name. Some of these earliest European residents remained living in the neighbourhood well into the mid nineteenth century, and their descendants for longer. Alongside the convicts were also free settlers. Some, like Daniel King, who arrived free in 1817, had married convict women. From the 1830s and onwards more families that were arriving free were settling in the area, especially as more tenements were constructed and tenant occupancy on the site increased. The archaeological site remained a vibrant, occupied neighbourhood throughout the nineteenth century until it was marked for demolition during the plague clearances of the early twentieth century. Evidence of all the levels of occupation from 1788 until the 1900s were to be found on the site and in the historical and archaeological resource. Commerce and trade Convict and free alike were involved in a variety of trades in the archaeological site from the early 1800s, right through until the area's resumption and demolition. George Cribb operated his butchery and a pub from the corner of Gloucester Street and Cribbs Lane from 1808. During the 1860s Owen Caraher, who like Cribb is remembered in the naming of Carahers Lane that ran north to south across the site, was making candles and soap in Gloucester Street. A bakery was operated by Thomas and James Share on the corner of Cumberland and Cribbs Lane from the 1830s, and later by Robert Berry. Berry's ovens were utilised by the local residents to cook their Sunday dinners, as ovens in private homes were a rare thing. By 1889 the Dig Site was occupied by approximately 33 houses, shops and hotels. Township - suburb and community The archaeological site existed as part of the wider Rocks community, from its earliest phase through to the beginnings of the twentieth century. The Rocks was Sydney's, and Australia's first suburb. The community on the site represented a broad cross section of the people living in The Rocks through the later eighteenth and nineteenth century; bond and free, rich and poor. The community bonds were often strong amongst the families living there. The historical record shows that the sons and daughters of the residents often lived close by when they left home. A number of mariner's wives are reported to have moved back to their parents' homes when their husbands were away at sea. There were a number of families who lived on the site over successive generations. Reports also exist of local families taking in orphans of their parents' friends rather than allowing them to be sent to the Destitute Asylum or other institution. As with any community however, there were less altruistic members of the Cumberland/Gloucester Streets community as well. Exploitation, crime and violence were also present on the site. Hotels and brothels operated alongside the bakeries and corner shops. Houses were often small and conditions cramped which added to the tensions of poverty that were experienced by some residents, as well as strengthening the feeling of community that existed within the site. The combination of these factors, the crowded streets, back lanes and hotels gave the outside world the impression that the area was an urban slum, a reputation that stayed with The Rocks and subject site for much of its history. Government and administration For much of the history of the archaeological site, it was perceived to lay just outside the boundaries of the official government and administrative reach. However, in 1900 following the outbreak of the plague in Sydney, The Rocks area was resumed by the Government. The Government became the landlord for approximately 900 properties in The Rocks area, including all of the subject site. With a view to cleaning up the worst areas of The Rocks and imposing some order on the remnant colonial landscape, parts of The Rocks were marked for demolition and redevelopment. The subject site was demolished entirely between 1902 and 1915. Houses, shops and hotels were all cleared away and the residents either relocated in The Rocks area or moved away entirely. The work brought to a decisive end the residential history of the subject site. For the remainder of the twentieth century the archaeological site was leased to a variety of users including machinery and joinery workshops, the City Railway Workshops, motor garages, the NRMA and Department of Motor Transport and Tramways as a bus parking station, and later as a Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority commissioning the archaeological excavation and historical research that was undertaken on the site in the early- and mid-1990s. This work led to the rediscovery of the residential community that had once occupied the subject site.Godden Mackay Logan 2006 2006-2010 foundations of the YHA Sydney Harbour, pictured in 2019. Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority's panel selected the winning proposal for the site by Youth Hostels Australia for a state-of-the-art, energy-efficient hostel with an additional twin classroom education centre. YHA Ltd is a not-for-profit organisation that returns profits from earnings back into its capital assets. Construction of Sydney Harbour YHA and The Big Dig Archaeology Education Centre took place between September 2008 and October 2009. During construction the archaeological remnants on site were carefully covered by a protective layer of sandbags and scaffolding, removed when the construction work was completed. The buildings are supported by structural-steel trusses spanning over the archaeological remains, allowing over 85% of the site to be visible at ground level. The physical impact on the site is restricted to , in areas carefully chosen in consultation with the archaeologists. The 106-room Sydney Harbour YHA hostel and The Big Dig Archaeology Education Centre were officially opened in April 2010. It is the largest archaeological urban development completed in Australia of its time. This carefully incorporated retention and display of the archaeological resource including elevating the building above ground level, reconstructing the original laneways as thoroughfares through the building and site, open voids in the building to view the archaeology, and construction of a Big Dig building for education about the dig site. Ongoing resources were also committed for funding further interpretation of the early history of the site.

The archaeological site is located on the western side of Sydney Cove between Cumberland Street and Gloucester Street, between the Australian Hotel to the north and the Jobbins Buildings (and other structures) adjacent to the Cahill Expressway to the south. A Youth Hostel (YHA) is elevated over the excavated archaeological site including an archaeology education centre and integrated interpretation. The new light-weight building is suspended above the archaeology, supported by a minimal number of pillars as the result of an innovative use of structural steel. The building not only has minimal impact upon the relics, but also provides increased visual and physical access through interior building voids, two reconstructed historic laneways (Cribbs and Carahers Lanes), interpretative works and artefact displays in the new building. = Condition = As at 27 July 2007, Assessment Condition: Minor Disturbance, Archaeological Excavation of 70% of resource, 1994. Assessment Basis: Excavations in 1994 revealed an exceptionally well preserved resource with over 750,000 artefacts recovered. Site preserves approximately 60% of its pre-1830 resource and 100% of remains of eight terraces built in the 1840s‚Äì1850s and demolished . Investigation: Full scale excavation, 1994. Other smaller scale excavations have been carried out by the University of Sydney Summer School in 2005 & 2006. The site was subject to archaeological investigation in 1994. The excavated site itself stands as testimony to the extent of excavation work completed and the array of historic structures and features revealed. The investigation uncovered substantial masonry remains of at least 46 buildings, post holes and more ephemeral remains of other timber structures, two major lane ways, ancillary paths, stone lined cesspits, tanks or wells carved into living rock and a wide variety of other landscape features. The remains have been retained in situ and generally survive intact. Excavation of the archaeological site required the removal of approximately 1500 contexts or deposits ranging from concrete and bitumen pavements through dumps of building rubble, or demolition and occupation accumulation. These features have been removed form the site; however, where relevant, samples have been retained for future analysis. A number of areas of the archaeological site remain unexcavated or partially excavated. These unexcavated areas generally remain intact. Some deposits and other material have been introduced to the site since the completion of the 1994 investigation, to protect or stabilise the exposed remains (e.g. wells and cesspits were lined with Bidum and backfilled). Gravel/pebbles and other materials have also been introduced by the Authority for interpretative purposes. Approximately 750,000 individual artefacts were recovered from the archaeological site during the course of the excavation. They are now stored off site. A youth hostel was constructed on the site, completed in 2009. This carefully incorporated retention and display of the archaeological resource, including elevating the building above ground level, reconstructing the original laneways as thoroughfares through the building and site, and construction of a Big Dig building for education about the dig site. Ongoing resources were also committed for funding further interpretation of the early history of the site. = Modifications and dates = *-1901various residential and commercial uses, demolition of some buildings as a result of the Darling Harbour resumptions in response to the bubonic plague outbreak in 1900. *1917Norton Griffiths machinery and joinery works. *1918City Railway Workshops. *1921-1924Department of Repatriation Vocational Training Trade School. *1925-1931motor garages. *1951-1972Department of Road Transport and Tramways bus depot. *1972-1994Storage Area *1994Archaeological Excavation *2009Youth Hostel building construction complete  Heritage listing  As at 15 October 2010, dating from 1795, the archaeological site has outstanding cultural significance as rare surviving evidence of the mostly convict and ex- convict community established on The Rocks at the time of Australia's first European settlement. The site contains identified relics of 46 historic houses, two lanes, and other features on two early Sydney town lots. It is one of few surviving places in The Rocks where a substantial physical connection exists to the time of first settlement, including the huts and scattered houses built on and carved into the sandstone outcrops that gave The Rocks its name. The site has strong historic associations, providing physical evidence of nineteenth-century events, processes and people. Through this association and the extraordinary level of public involvement in the 1994 excavation, the site has high social and public value as a \\"historic site\\". Located within a historic precinct, the substantial physical evidence of the site has distinctive visual qualities and evocative capacity. The archaeological significance of the site continues through both the information being revealed by analysis of excavated material and continuing in situ presence of substantial structural elements and deposits. The in situ relics also have potential to yield further information relating to substantive historical research questions. The site has a unique ability to provide \\"hands on\\" experience of important phases of Sydney's history and development and has high interpretative and educational potential. The 2004‚Äì2010 archaeological investigation and redevelopment of the site is an outstanding example of best practice archaeological management and interpretation in Australia. The sensitive construction of a Youth Hostel (YHA) over the archaeological site and integrated interpretation of this archaeological site has received multiple awards in design and heritage. The YHA development has been described as arguably one of the best contemporary examples of in-situ conservation of archaeological remains in an urban context anywhere in the world.GML 2010 Cumberland Street archaeological site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 December 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The occupation of The Rocks during the first decades of the settlement at Sydney Cove represented a significant phase and important activity in the early life and development of the Sydney community and the City of Sydney itself. It was the quarter of the town built, shaped and occupied mostly by convicts and ex-convicts. The physical elements at the site provide a material dimension to this part of early Sydney history and evidence of the convict/ex-convict lifestyle. The latter is particularly significant as the organic growth of The Rocks settlement and lack of government regulation evident in the remains of houses contrasts the popular perceptions of convict life. The Rocks was important as both domicile and workplace for the lower orders of Sydney society in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Its history and development stands in stark contrast to that recorded for other sections of society in official documentation. Features directly connected with early occupation of The Rocks, particularly the evidence of material culture and buildings which have been revealed through archaeological investigation, reflect the taste habits and means, and hence the sociocultural characteristics of the sites inhabitants. The collection of artefacts provides evidence that leads to questions about the traditional view of this area during the late nineteenth century as a \\"blighted slum\\". The surviving structural elements in their size, construction and format evoke the living conditions of a vanished community. Through both historic records and surviving physical evidence that site is associated with many major phases of Sydney's history and processes that have shaped the development of the growing colony. The subject site witnessed sporadic occupation, consolidation through permissive occupancy and leases, the introduction of land grants, varying phases of intensification and construction, wholesale resumption and clearing and, eventually, low key industrial and later government usage. It provides, in microcosm, a typical slice through the evolution and history of one of the most vital, lively and infamous communities in urban Australia. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The archaeological site represents, in microcosm, a slice of The Rocks life and community covering more than a century. It has strong links and association with a major Sydney community and a section of New South Wales society. The historical research already undertaken provides a depth and richness to our understanding of the individuals who lived there, none of whom is currently recognised as a \\"historic\\" figure in the traditional sense, but all of whom (certainly before the 1830s) might be characterised as pioneers of Sydney. The associational links are particularly strong because of the presence of actual building remains (and artefacts) that relate to known individuals, families and households. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. As an excavated historical archaeological site, the site has well defined visual quality. Within the physical context of The Rocks, and the setting of surrounding historic buildings, the site currently contributes to a rich amalgam of historical layering. This layering is particularly evident within the site itself, where historical events, phases and occupations are reflected in the fine grained texture of intersecting topography and structural remains. The place is instantly recognisable as a historic site. The 2004‚Äì2010 excavation, interpretation and redevelopment of the site is an outstanding example of best practice archaeological management for Australia. The sensitive construction of a Youth Hostel (YHA) above the archaeological site and integrated interpretation of this archaeological site has received multiple awards in design and heritage. The YHA development has been described as arguably one of the best contemporary examples of in situ conservation of archaeological remains in an urban context anywhere in the world. The new youth hostel building reconstructs the original laneways intersecting the site, providing important views to most parts of the site's archaeology as well as vistas from within and outside of the site. These allow an appreciation of the early 19th century layout of the buildings and lanes in this segment of the Rocks. The recreated view corridors and vistas created by the open lanes correspond to early historical photographs before the 19th century buildings were cleared at the turn of the century. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Rocks is now widely recognised as one of the key components of Australia's birthplace. As a focus of early convict settlement, the site occupies a particular conceptual niche. Furthermore, through the green bans of the 1970s, the resurgence in conservations programs of the 1980s and, via a continuing community spirit and pride in its community, The Rocks has already been established as a special place of particular importance to residents and visitors alike. The archaeological site is one of few surviving places within The Rocks where a substantial physical connection exists with the time of first settlement and the huts and scattered houses on the rocky crags that gave \\"The Rocks\\" its name. The thousands of people who visited the archaeological site and participated in the 1994 excavation program at varying levels demonstrate its value to the contemporary community. Ongoing access to physical evidence and interpretation has potential to realise and enhance the social value of the place. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Archaeological deposits and features, particularly when considered in conjunction with documentary evidence can provide evidence of material culture that yields information which may by unavailable from documentary sources alone. This site and the collection of excavated material form a resource which contributes to a better understanding of social, economic and cultural history of Sydney and The Rocks community in particular. Archaeological excavation at the site has already realised a substantial part of its archaeological potential. Many site specific research questions have been answered. Analysis of the data gathered has addressed major historical questions, including the impact of the industrial revolution, the rise of class, women's occupation and lives, the ongoing debate on the standard of living for working-class people in urban areas, the social and cultural role of The Rocks within the larger city, and the changing impact of Government over the historical period. Some areas of the site remain unexcavated and have potential available for future investigation. While the excavation to date has produced a complete picture of the activities undertaken on the site, should it be decided in the future to excavate the remaining areas, it is expected that this new information would complement the information already gathered. The physical remains at the site and the associated artefact collection provide major ongoing research opportunities in fields such as convictism, colonial settlement and working class communities, which are major themes in Australian history. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The archaeological site is believed to be the only substantial residential site (i.e. one containing an entire neighbourhood), remaining in Sydney's Rocks, that contains physical evidence of structures and material culture from the period of first settlement. The 1994 archaeological investigation recovered enormous quantities of artefacts and the remains of many structures - all of which survived here because of later twentieth century activity had not impinged greatly on the surviving features. In this respect, the archaeological site contrasts with many other places in urban Australia where the extent of building activity undertaken during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s has removed structures and stratified deposits. Any area with potential for in situ preservation of relics from nineteenth century Sydney, and particularly the early part of the century or prior to 1800, represent a finite, rare and endangered resource. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The continuous occupation of the archaeological site from the late eighteenth century throughout the nineteenth century provides the opportunity to experience and examine changes and development in society and particularly changes in home life and the use of domestic space. The evidence at the archaeological site demonstrates characteristics of both individual residences and a residential/Rocks community (including hotels, shops and other workplaces) during this period, providing a physical demonstration and important \\"hands on\\" opportunity to understand how earlier lifestyles and living conditions differed from those of today.

The castle was built on the site of a Roman castrum which housed the garrison and administration of the region named \\"Lapurdum\\". From the end of the 11th century, the Viscounts of Labourd begin building a castle around the three Roman towers and walls around the town, as their residence. The castle became English upon the Duchy of Aquitaine, being inherited by the English crown. After the French took occupation of the castle and town in 1294, an English force led by John St John, laid siege to the town. On 1 January 1295, the citizens of Bayonne drove the French garrison into the castle and opened the town gates to St John. The French garrison of the castle surrendered after a siege of eleven days. A new castle was constructed in Bayonne during the 15th century in Petit-Bayonne, by King Charles VII of France, as a place to watch the city he had just taken over from the English. In the 17th century, on the orders of Vauban undertaking fortifications to protect Bayonne, the castle became the North West fortifications of the city. The central tower was destroyed and a fortified forecourt was added. In 1808, Napol√©on Bonaparte signed a decree ordering the castle's demolition, which was not undertaken. It was classified as a historic monument on 7 November 1931. The castle is currently the mess of the 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment.

It has long, dark brown to blackish stems and groups of up to thirty yellowish to greenish, sweetly scented flowers and is endemic to eastern Australia.  Description  Erythrorchis cassythoides is a leafless, climbing, mycotrophic herb that has thin, wiry, dark brown to blackish stems up to long and branching groups of flowers with between ten and thirty resupinate flowers. The groups of flowers are long, each flower yellow to greenish and wide. The sepals and petals are long and wide with the lateral sepals and petals curved and spreading apart from each other. The labellum is white, long, wide with wavy or crinkled edges but has brown or reddish streaks as it ages. There is a callus consisting of a hairy plate and two round ridges in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August to December and is followed by the fruit which is a capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming The black bootlace orchid was first formally described by Richard Cunningham who sent a specimen and hand-written description to his brother Allan, giving the plant the name Dendrobium cassythoides. Allan Cunningham, in turn sent the description to John Lindley who published it in Edwards's Botanical Register. In 1986, Leslie Andrew Garay changed the name to Erythrorchis cassythoides. In the note to his brother, Richard Cunningham wrote that he had called the plant \\"Cassythoides, from the prima facie resemblance it has to the genus Cassytha, not only in its leafless character and short racemes of flowers, but in its peculiar bronze or japanned papulose stems - it may be found, that it also resembles it in its climbing propensities.\\" John Lindley noted \\"It is not a little remarkable that so highly curious a plant as this should so long have been over looked, although a native of a locality which, as Mr. Allan Cunningham remarks, has doubtless been traversed by Botanists of many countries in Europe, who have visited Port Jackson in ships of discovery since the Colony was founded in January 1788, viz., French, Spanish, German, Swedish, Russian, &c.;, besides many of our own countrymen.\\" Distribution and habitat Erythrorchis cassythoides grows in forest on eucalypts, stumps and logs in near-coastal areas and nearby tablelands between the Blackdown Tableland in Queensland and Waterfall in the Royal National Park, New South Wales.

Since 2007, local community group People's Republic of Stokes Croft have led initiatives to envisage the redevelopment of the site as a community asset. In 2014, the Mayor of Bristol announced Westmoreland House would be demolished, while the neighbouring Carriage Works would be spared and turned into flats as it is a Grade II* listed building. Local residents, who enjoy the diversity and anticommercial nature of Stokes Croft were unimpressed with the plans and hoped something more inspiring could be designed. Campaign material against the redevelopment was posted to the front of Westmoreland House, including a hand-painted sign on the former main entrance that reads \\"No to luxury flats ‚Äì yes to affordable homes\\" Demolition of Westmoreland House was scheduled to begin in July 2018, but delayed owing to the discover of asbestos. Demolition began on 21 November 2018. As at March 2020, the site is still empty, rebuilding work has not begun.

At an early age, he learned to play baseball with blacks and whites integrated at San Diego High School and in youth leagues in the area, as his teammates dubbed him Johnny Baseball for his passion and enthusiasm for the game. As a high school student from 1938 through 1940, Ritchey was a three-year letterman and played in the school team under coach Mike Morrow. In the same period, he also played for three years with American Legion Baseball clubs, also coached by Morrow. At age 15, Ritchey and another black player, Nelson Manuel, starred on the Post Six American Legion squad that competed in the Junior World Series held at Spartanburg, South Carolina in 1938, even though neither could play in the tournament because in Spartanburg they did not allow allow blacks to share the game field with white players. The next year, the Post 6 club, again led by Ritchey and Manuel, returned to the American Legion finals held at North Carolina. The two boys were assured they would be allowed to play only to find out when they arrived that not only could they play, they were not even allowed to sit in the stands to watch the game. After high school, Ritchey enrolled at San Diego State College to study pre-law and play for the San Diego State Aztecs baseball. But a short time after that, he was recruited along with the rest of his generation and had to join the Army during World War II, serving 27 months in a combat engineering outfit and seeing service at the Invasion of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge as well as in the South West Pacific theatre, while earning five battle stars along with staff sergeant stripes.Anton, Todd; Nowlin, Bill (2008).

Ritchey made history soon later, becoming the first ever African American to play in the Pacific Coast League. With the color barrier already broken by Robinson, the Chicago Cubs scouted Ritchey while playing with the American Giants at Comiskey Park and invited him for a tryout at Wrigley Field in September 1948. Ritchey worked out for the Cubs for six hours, but no contract came. Instead, the Cubs suggested he play in the winter leagues, after which they might have sent him to their minor league system. Ritchey then returned to California, where the offer to play in his hometown in the Pacific Coast League was more attractive for him. At the time, the PCL was usually considered just a half-notch below the big leagues and sometimes like a third Major League. As a result, he joined the San Diego Padres in 1948. Ritchey would be joined later that year by negro leaguers Booker McDaniels, Alonzo Perry, and the aforementioned Wilson.Riley, James (2002).

Each version of the work typically establishes its own continuity, and sometimes introduces parallel universes, to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified. This article details various versions of Deadpool depicted in works including Marvel Comics Ultimate universe and What if issues. Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse timeline, Deadpool was redubbed Dead Man Wade and reimagined as a bitter, humorless member of Apocalypse's Pale Riders, having received his flawed healing factor from Apocalypse's eugenics program.

She collaborates with a gang inspired by Hydra Agent Bob and is wanted by the police. She has taken an older Wade prisoner and forces him to watch political debates while chained up, angered that he's ruined her life and hopes she can use him to find her mother. Wade reveals he and Shiklah had a falling out after the death of Ellie, which led to a battle between the two former lovers in Hell.Deadpool vol. 4, #6. The new Deadpool is also being pursued by a woman who wears a costume that looks like Wade's \\"Zenpool\\" identity from Axis.

The doctor treating him is actually Psycho- Man in disguise, who attempts to torture and brainwash Deadpool into becoming his personal minion. The procedure fails, but leaves Deadpool even more mentally unhinged, erasing the \\"serious\\" and \\"Screwball\\" voices in his head and replacing them with a voice that only wants destruction. Under \\"Evil Voice's\\" influence, Deadpool develops a more nihilistic world view and as a result, after killing Psycho-Man by repeatedly smashing him against a desk, (and after he burns the hospital by using gasoline) he begins assassinating every superhero and supervillain on Earth, starting with the Fantastic Four and even killing the Watcher, in an apparent attempt to rebel against his comic book creators. The book ends with him breaking into the \\"real\\" world and confronting the Marvel writers and artists who are writing the book.

The year had started with a \\"huge\\" French army under John, Duke of Normandy, son and heir of King Philip VI, besieging the strategically important town of Aiguillon in Gascony. Lancaster refused battle and harassed the French supply lines while preventing Aiguillon from being blockaded. After a five-month siege the French were ordered north to confront the main English army, which on 12 July had landed in Normandy under Edward III of England and commenced the Cr√©cy campaign. This left the French defences in the southwest both weak and disorganised. Lancaster took advantage by launching offensives into Quercy and the Bazadais and himself leading a third force on a large- scale mounted raid (a chevauch√©e) between 12 September and 31 October 1346. All three offensives were successful, with Lancaster's chevauch√©e, of approximately 2,000 English and Gascon soldiers, meeting no effective resistance from the French, penetrating north and storming the rich city of Poitiers. His force then burnt and looted large areas of Saintonge, Aunis and Poitou, capturing numerous towns, castles and smaller fortified places as they went. The offensives completely disrupted the French defences and shifted the focus of the fighting from the heart of Gascony to or more beyond its borders. Background Since the Norman Conquest of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them vassals of the kings of France. By 1337 only Gascony in southwestern France and Ponthieu in northern France were left. The independent-minded Gascons preferred their relationship with a distant English king who left them alone to one with a French king who would interfere in their affairs. Following a series of disagreements between Philip VI of France () and Edward III of England (), on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council agreed Gascony should be taken back into Philip's hands, on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the Hundred Years' War, which was to last 116 years. thumbupright=0.75alt=A map of French territory as it was in 1340, showing the enclave of Gascony in the southwestFrance in 1330 Before the war commenced, well over 1000 ships a year departed from Gascony. Among their cargoes were over of locally produced wine. The duty levied by the English Crown on wine from Bordeaux was more than all other customs duties combined and by far the largest source of state income. Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, had a population of over 50,000, greater than London's, and was possibly richer. However, by this time English Gascony had become so truncated by French encroachments that it relied on imports of food, largely from England. Any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve Gascony and financially cripple England; the French were well aware of this. The border between English and French territory in Gascony was extremely unclear. Many landholders owned a patchwork of widely separated estates, perhaps owing fealty to a different overlord for each. Each small estate was likely to have a fortified tower or keep, with larger estates having castles. Fortifications were also constructed at transport choke points, to collect tolls and to restrict military passage; fortified towns grew up alongside all bridges and most fords over the many rivers in the region. Military forces could support themselves by foraging so long as they moved on frequently. If they wished to remain in one place for any length of time, as was necessary to besiege a castle, then access to water transport was essential for supplies of food and fodder and desirable for such items as siege equipment. Although Gascony was the cause of the war, in most campaigning seasons the Gascons had had to rely on their own resources and had been hard pressed by the French. In 1339 the French besieged Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, even breaking into the city with a large force before they were repulsed. Typically the Gascons could field 3,000‚Äì6,000 men, the large majority infantry, although up to two-thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons. Warfare was usually a struggle for possession of castles and other fortified points, and for the mutable loyalty of the local nobility. =1345 campaign= By 1345, after eight years of war, English-controlled territory mostly consisted of a coastal strip from Bordeaux to Bayonne, with isolated strongholds further inland. In 1345 Edward III had sent Henry, Earl of Lancaster to Gascony, and had assembled his main army for action in northern France or Flanders. It had sailed but never landed, after the fleet was scattered in a storm. Knowledge of Edward III's intent had kept French focus on the north until late in the campaigning season. Meanwhile, LancasterDuring the 1345 campaign he was known as the Earl of Derby, but his father died in September 1345 and he became the Earl of Lancaster. . had led a whirlwind campaign at the head of an Anglo-Gascon army. He had smashed two large French armies at the battles of Bergerac and Auberoche, captured French towns and fortifications in much of P√©rigord and most of Agenais and given the English possessions in Gascony strategic depth. During the winter following this successful campaign, Lancaster's second in command, Ralph, Earl of Stafford, had marched on the vitally important town of Aiguillon, which commanded the junction of the Rivers Garonne and Lot, making it important both for trade and for military communications. The inhabitants had attacked the garrison and opened the gates to the English. French offensive John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir of Philip VI, was placed in charge of all French forces in southwest France, as he had been the previous autumn. In March 1346 a French army under Duke John, numbering between 15,000 and 20,000, enormously superior to any force the Anglo-Gascons could field, marched on Aiguillon and besieged it on 1April. On 2April an arri√®re-ban, a formal call to arms for all able-bodied males, was announced for southern France. French national financial, logistical and manpower efforts were focused on this offensive. Edward III again gathered a large army in England. The French were aware of this, but given the extreme difficulty of disembarking an army other than at a port, the English no longer having access to a port in Flanders, and the existence of friendly ports in Brittany and Gascony, they assumed that Edward would sail for one of the latter; probably Gascony, in order to relieve Aiguillon. To guard against any possibility of an English landing in northern France, Philip VI relied on his powerful navy. This reliance was misplaced given the naval technology of the time and the French were unable to prevent Edward III successfully crossing the Channel and landing in the Cotentin Peninsula, in northern Normandy, on 12 July with an army between 12,000 and 15,000 strong. The English achieved complete strategic surprise and marched south, cutting a wide swath of destruction through some of the richest lands in France and burning every town they passed. Philip VI immediately recalled his main army, under Duke John, from Gascony. After a furious argument with his advisers, and according to some accounts his father's messenger, Duke John refused to move until his honour was satisfied. On 29 July Philip VI called an arri√®re-ban for northern France at Rouen. On 7August the English reached the Seine. Philip VI again sent orders to John of Normandy insisting that he abandon the siege of Aiguillon and march his army north. Edward III marched south east and on 12 August his army was from Paris. On 14 August Duke John attempted to arrange a local truce. Lancaster, well aware of the situation in the north and in the French camps around Aiguillon, refused. On 20 August, after over five months, the French abandoned the siege and marched away in considerable haste and disorder. Duke John did not rejoin the French army in the north until after it had been heavily defeated at the Battle of Cr√©cy six days later. Anglo-Gascon offensive Henry of Grosmont, Earl of Lancaster, Earl of Derby The withdrawal of Duke John's army led to the collapse of the French positions in southern P√©rigord and most of Agenais. The French only held on to their strongholds in the Garonne valley, Port-Sainte-Marie, Agen and Marmande downstream of Aiguillon. The English extended their control to include the whole of the Lot valley below Villeneuve and most of the remaining French outposts between the Lot and the Dordogne, during late August. Lancaster was able to capture most towns without a fight. John, Count of Armagnac, was appointed French royal lieutenant in the region after Duke John's withdrawal. He struggled to provide effective resistance because of lack of troops; insufficient funds; and repeatedly having his orders countermanded by Philip VI. He formally offered his resignation within three months of his appointment. Lancaster now held the operational initiative. In early September he launched three separate offensives. Local English sympathisers in the Agenais under Gaillard I de Durfort blockaded Agen and Porte Sainte Marie and raided into Quercy to the west. A large detachment of Gascons was split up to reoccupy the French-held territory to the south and west of the Garonne under the overall command of Alixandre de Caumont, in a mopping up operation. Lancaster took command of 1,000 men-at-arms and approximately the same number of mounted infantry and led them north on 12 September; most of this force was Gascon. The force in the Agenais raided deep into Quercy, penetrating over . Gaillard, leading 400 cavalry, captured the small town of Tulle. This sparked widespread panic in the province of Auvergne. The army of John of Armagnac was diverted to Tulle, which it besieged from mid-November until late December, when the Gascon occupiers surrendered on terms and were taken prisoner; all were ransomed. The whole French field army of the southwest was tied down by Gaillard's small force. The modern historian Jonathan Sumption describes this as \\"dislocating the royal administration in central and southern France for three months\\". The troops under Caumont swept through the Bazadais, capturing numerous French- held towns and fortifications for little or no loss. Many of these were handed over after negotiations; Bazas itself for example surrendered after negotiating access for its products through English-occupied territory on favourable terms. The French presence in the area was all but extinguished. =Lancaster's chevauch√©e= Lancaster targeted the rich provincial capital of Poitiers, deep in French-held territory north of his starting point. He marched from the Garonne to the Charente, , in eight days, arriving at Ch√¢teauneuf-sur-Charente which he captured. He then diverted to Saint- Jean-d'Ang√©ly to rescue some English prisoners. Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly was stormed, captured, and sacked. Leaving a garrison, Lancaster turned back towards Poitiers, covering 20 miles a day and taking the towns of Melle and Lusignan on the way. Lancaster reached Poitiers late on 3October. Poitiers occupied a naturally strong position, but its defences had seen little maintenance for centuries. The city had no royal garrison and the townspeople and local notables had fallen out of the habit of maintaining a guard. Defensive responsibilities were split between the town and three different church bodies, which had the effect of preventing any effective action. The English launched an immediate assault, but they were repulsed by an improvised force organised by some local noblemen. During the night the English found a breach in the wall, which had been deliberately created years before to allow easy access from the city to a nearby watermill. In the morning they seized it and forced their way into eastern Poitiers, killing everyone they came across. As was usual, only those who appeared wealthy enough to afford a ransom were spared. Most of the population fled the city, but over 600 were killed. The town was thoroughly sacked for eight days. Lancaster was unable to take the royal mint at Montreuil-Bonnin, west of Poitiers, and marched rapidly back to Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly. He made no attempt to hold Poitiers; in the province of Poitou he only left troops at Lusignan, a small town with good walls and a strong, modern castle. Once back in Saintonge he took control of the Boutonne valley all the way to the sea, including the major port of Rochefort and the well-fortified island of Ol√©ron. Lancaster then marched south, taking a large number of small towns and fortifications. The French were left in control of much of Saintonge: the eastern parts; the larger fortifications such as the province's capital, Saintes, and its strongest castle, Taillebourg; and several strategically important strongholds on the east bank of the Gironde. Lancaster arrived in Bordeaux, the capital of English Gascony, on 31 October seven weeks after he set out on his chevauch√©e. He returned to England in early 1347. Aftermath Lancaster left garrisons in the captured towns and castles throughout Saintonge and Aunis, with an especially large garrison at Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly. The Anglo-Gascons supported themselves by raiding French- held and French-leaning territory; as Sumption puts it, they \\"were not so much expected to control territory as to create chaos and insecurity\\". Whole provinces, securely held by the French only months before, were overrun by bandits, freebooters, deserters and retained troops of both sides. The population moved away from the villages to the relative safety of the towns, townsfolk who could, moved away from the area, and much of the agricultural land went uncultivated. The French ability to counter-attack was lost as they concentrated on attempting to defend the host of newly vulnerable locations or on recovering towns captured deep in what had been considered safe territory, as at Tulle. French trade declined and their taxation income from the area was severely curtailed. Lancaster had moved the focus of the fighting from the heart of Gascony to 50 miles or more beyond its borders. The English army in the north, after its victory at Cr√©cy, went on to besiege Calais. Lancaster joined it there in the summer of 1347 and was present when Calais fell after an eleven-month siege, securing an English entrep√¥t into northern France which was held for two hundred years. The war in southwest France stayed far from Gascony. In 1355 Edward III's eldest son, Edward, the Black Prince, led a large-scale chevauch√©e north from Bordeaux that devastated France. After another devastating chevauch√©e in 1356, the French army, commanded by Duke John, now King John II of France, intercepted it and forced the outnumbered English to battle from Poitiers; the French were decisively defeated and John was captured.

These were mid-sized, long-legged flightless birds,Gerald Mayr (2009). Paleogene Fossil Birds superficially similar but unrelated to modern ratites. However, a recent study shows that these birds may actually be true ratites related to ostriches. Classification It is rather unambiguous that geranoidids are either part of or stem representatives of Gruoidea, the clade that includes modern cranes, limpkins and trumpeters, though their precise relationship varies among studies, some recovering them as sister taxa to another clade of flightless ratite-like birds, the eogruiids. The most recent consensus appears to be that geranoidids are outside of Gruoidea, with eogruiids being more closely related to modern cranes. However, Mayr (2019) argued that close affinities between Geranoididae and the palaeognathous family Palaeotididae are at least as well supported as the classification of geranoidids into the Gruiformes. Taxonomy The exact number of genera and species are also somewhat controversial. For instance, a recent study recovers Geranoides as possibly synonymous with Palaeophasianus and Eogeranoides as possibly synonymous with Paragrus. Paleobiology Most geranoidids appear to have been flightless, possessing long legs and short wings that presumably leant to herbivorous habits, giving them a profile and lifestyle similar to that of modern ratites. Most if not all of them were forest dwellers, a lifestyle curiously also present in contemporaneous ratites such as Palaeotis and Remiornis. While competition and lack thereof between ratites and eogruiids has been examined extensively,Kurochkin, E.N. 1976. A survey of the Paleogene birds of Asia. Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology 27:75-86.Kurochkin, E.N. 1981. New representatives and evolution of two archaic gruiform families in Eurasia. Transactions of the Soviet-Mongolian Paleontologial Expedition 15:59-85. niche partitioning between geranoidids and ratites has currently not, in spite of factors like geranoidids being most common in North America, where there are no ratites, or the fact that some European ratites were carnivorous. Paleoecology and distribution Geranoidids are most common in Eocene fossil sites in North America, particularly in the Willwood Formation were up to six species are known. Galligeranoides occurs in the Eocene of France in association with another flightless bird, Gastornis, potentially indicating that geranoidids took advantage of land bridges to arrive to Europe. However, Mayr (2019) considered Galligeranoides to be a member of Palaeognathae closely related to Palaeotis, and formally transferred Galligeranoides from the family Geranoididae to the family Palaeotididae. This transfer restricts the fossil record of the family Geranoididae to North America.

Early life Born Dorothy Mary Liddell to Emily Catherine Berry and her husband John Liddell at Benwell, England in 1890. She was one of six children born to the couple. Her father was a prosperous director of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company and a Justice of the Peace first for Northumberland and later for Basingstoke. There were three boys and three girls in the family. The family moved several times and by 1898 were living in Prudhoe Hall. In 1904 the family moved to Sydmonton Cork near Newbury and then later in 1908 to Sherfield Manor, Basingstoke. The family were philanthropic and interested in their community where ever they lived. They were a very close knit family. Liddell was known as Dolly and Tabitha to her family. Tabitha was a character she had performed to entertain the convalescent soldiers who stayed in Sherfield Manor when it was used as a hospital during the First World War. Liddell was a nurse in the hospital and after the death of her brother Aidan, a Victoria Cross recipient, and the closure of the hospital she joined the red cross in La Panne and worked there until the end of the war. She was awarded a M.B.E. for her service. Career Liddell was raised with the typical education of the time, taught by governesses and tutors. She was able to perform well on the violin and was a debutante, presented at Court. Although she was a noted archaeologist, she had been unable to get a formal education in archaeology. However she went on to become a significant figure in British archaeology. She worked for the 1925-1929 Windmill Hill, Avebury excavations where she was the first to recognise the use of bird bones to decorate Neolithic pottery. This site had a significant influence on the perception of Neolithic life. Liddell discovered the young Leakey and worked with her initially for three summers and later trained her for four years. Together they worked on the Hembury site in Devon, where Liddell uncovered a framed entrance which led to an enclosure which had been destroyed by fire. She also discovered more pottery matching other locations like Fort Harrouard in France and other Iron Age sites. Her work is still cited in other papers about these. Alexander Keiller gave a speech at the opening of the Alexander Keiller Museum in Avebury shortly after Liddell's death, where he thanked her and spoke of the Museum as a tribute to her work. Liddell died prematurely and was buried with her parents and brother near the Church of the Holy Ghost in Basingstoke.

She has part of a panel discussion hosted by Hugh Bernard Price, who was the president of the National Urban League. On the panel Nomsa represented the voice of the parents for education reform. The panel discussion appeared on C-Span in the 1997 forum on U.S. Education of Urban Residents. In the 90's she represented Partners for Reform in Math and Science (PRISM) for several years. As an educational reformer, and advocating within the educational system Nomsa turned to homeschooling, and homeschooled her 5th child. He scored very high in the SAT test. After homeschooling her 5th child he went back into the public school system, and attended the, Bronx High School of Science. Which was one of New York City's specialized high school at the time. She also homeschooled her 6th child. After homeschooling her 5th and 6th child she became a volunteer teacher for community children. =Grandassa Model - Pioneers of the Black is Beautiful movement= In 1956 the Jazz-Art Society was formed. It was renamed the African Jazz-Art Society & Studios ‚Äì AJASS. The African Jazz Arts Society Studio (AJASS) was comprised by organizers Elombe Brath, Kwame Brathwaite, Robert Gumbs, Frank Adu, Chris Asmandeces Hall, David K. Ward, Leroy ‚ÄúSatch‚Äù Giles, Jimmy Abu Williams, and Ernest Baxter. AJASS productions started in Harlem. They produced art exhibitions and African cultural presentations. AJASS was a forerunner of what latter became known as \\"The Black Arts Movement.\\" They produced jazz concerts and AJASS started the Grandassa Models, and the theme was ‚ÄúBlack Is Beautiful.‚Äù They were influenced by Carlos A. Cooks, and the African Nationalist Pioneer Movement (ANPM). The (ANPM) grew out of the Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League UNIA Movement. Which influenced the creation of Grandassa Models. The UNIA hosted on Garvey Day, August 17 of each year a \\"Miss Natural Standard of Beauty Contest.\\" Helene White was one of the original Grandassa Models in the \\"Naturally '62\\" beauty and fashion show. She was featured as the Cover Girl on numerous Jazz Album covers by Lou Donaldson. Her popularity led her to be featured internationally on magazine covers in Africa highlighting Black women in the United States, wearing their hair in its natural state. Grandassa models represented natural African American standards of beauty. They were on magazine covers, and album covers in the United States as beauty icons. Nomsa became an icon for Black female empowerment in the New York Citizen Call Newspaper cartoon strip. The newspaper was a strong voice for the black community during the 1950s and 60's. The early 1980s brought Nomsa Brath's popularity to light when she was caricatured into a Grandassa Logo by her husband, Elombe Brath, on event fliers. Afterward, these fliers were distributed in Harlem for Cultural political events, highlighting the voice of the urban community. The ‚ÄúNaturally‚Äù beauty shows continued through the 1980s regularly, and later became commemorative events. = Asbestos removal in schools pioneer = Nomsa was an advocate for the removal of asbestos from schools in New York City public schools. In 1985 The Journal of Law and Education highlighted Helene Brathwaite's asbestos removal advocacy work and enforcement cost the New York City Public school system in New York City. Her work and efforts along with others led to shut down of primary and grade schools in the 1970s. She was President of the Parents Teacher Association and Chairperson of the Parents' Committee of PS 185/208. Her children and her neighbors' children attended the schools that were shut down due to the hazards of asbestos. It was known that 20% of the schools in New York City had asbestos, and the risk of mesothelioma to younger children had not been properly addressed. Many school buildings were constructed before the federal asbestos regulations were put in place, containing asbestos. Before it was realized that asbestos was dangerous. It was a natural mineral used in the construction industry and in the buildings of schools. It was later recognized as a disease-causing danger, linked to illnesses, like mesothelioma. Nomsa researched and learned the dangers of asbestos. Her research led her to work with the superintendent and stress the importance of closing the schools down. Along with pushing to close the asbestos-filled school buildings down, Nomsa urged the superintendent to bus children to different schools throughout New York that were free of any asbestos problems. The financial toll the NYC school system and New York had to endure was a litmus test for what could happen if parental advocacy was realized in other schools. Since then, Federal guidelines have been enhanced, clarified, and expanded. Today, The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is responsible for outlining and enforcing federal laws related to asbestos in school buildings. The Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) has two requirements for all public, private, and charter schools in the U.S. These requirements include mandatory inspections of buildings for the presence of asbestos and the creation of management plans to prevent or reduce the risks of asbestos exposure. However, neither The EPA nor AHERA requires that schools remove the asbestos found after inspections. The loophole for schools around removing asbestos is that they only need an in-place plan to manage to reduce the risks of exposure. The law states that asbestos does not typically need to be removed. It only needs to be removed from the building when it is seriously damaged or when it is at risk of being disturbed by renovation or demolition. In open letters from The United Federation of Teachers to parents and educators, the UFT stated how Nomsa Brath, single-handedly forced The Board of Education to accept findings of how scientists have known of the dangers of asbestos for years. = Case of the Central Park 5= Nomsa Brath was one of the major organizers in the high- profile cases in New York City known as the Central Park Jogger case. Five African American youth were indicted, and became known as the Central Park 5. Nomsa founded a group called ‚ÄúMother Love‚Äù composed of mothers and female activists who organized for the support of the innocence of the five teenagers that were alleged to have attacked the female jogger on the night of April 19, 1989. Nomsa and others believed in the innocence of the young men. 'Mother Love' were supporters of the Central Park 5. The media at the time expressed empathy for the jogger. The case polarized New York City. Inflamed rhetoric and newspaper ads were published. Donald Trump took out ads calling for the death penalty of the five young men. Many saw the media as rushing to judgment. 'Mother Love' did media and press campaign for justice. Nomsa's husband Elombe and his involvement in media communications of television and radio helped to publicize the injustices. In 2002 the 5 young men known in the media as the Central Park 5 were exonerated due to the confessions of Matias Reyes. Reyes, a convicted murderer and serial rapist, was in prison and confessed to raping the jogger. DNA evidence confirmed his guilt. He stated that he acted alone in the killing of the Central Park Jogger. Nomsa's work and advocacy on this case appears in books by three different authors. Black Women in America edited by Kim Marie Vaz, High-Profile Crimes by Lynn S. Chancer, and The Central Park Five: A Chronicle of a City Wilding by Sarah Burns, which addressed Nomsa's significance in this case. Sarah Burns, the author of the latter book, is the daughter of Kenneth Lauren Burns, a documentary filmmaker. Sarah and Ken are the producers of the 2012 documentary of the Central Park 5. The film suggests that Prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer of the New York District Attorney's Office poked little holes of doubt in every witness‚Äô testimony. In an upcoming film about the Central Park 5, Nomsa Brath will be played by actress Adepero Oduye. An upcoming film about the Central Park 5 by Ava DuVernay which is set to be released in April 2019. Jeff Skoll and Jonathan King from Participant Media, Oprah Winfrey/Harpo Productions Films, Jane Rosenthal and Berry Welsh from Tribeca Productions and DuVernay are the executive producers of the movie When They See Us In 2008, Nomsa had a stroke that restricted her activism and painting.

Known only from a single toe bone, Hypselornis was originally mistakenly identified as a ratite bird related to the living cassowary before being re-identified as belonging to a large reptile, probably a crocodilian. Discovery and naming The holotype specimen of Hypselornis (no. 39733) was found in the late Pliocene aged Siwalik Hills of northern India, and was collected by Proby Cautley who presented it to the Natural History Museum in London. This specimen consists of a single toe bone (phalanx), and was initially mistakenly thought to have been referred to Struthio asiaticus by Richard Lydekker in 1879. This mistake was corrected by palaeontologist William Davies in 1880, who concluded that the phalanx was from the middle toe of a new species of ratite distinct from the contemporary Struthio asiaticus and Dromaius sivalensis (a purported species of emu from India also known from toe bones that themselves likely belong to an ungulate mammal). Lydekker would later classify the fossil as \\"Genus, non det.\\" in 1884, and in 1891 he referred the fossil to its own genus and species, Hypselornis sivalensis (despite using the same specific name, Lydekker named H. sivalensis as a new species independent from D. sivalensis). An etymology for the name was never given by Lydekker, but one was offered by ornithologist Charles Wallace Richmond as deriving from the Ancient Greek \\"·ΩëœàŒ∑ŒªœåœÇ\\" (lofty, towering) and \\"·ΩÑœÅŒΩŒπœÇ\\" (bird). Classification As indicated by the name, Hypselornis was originally interpreted as a fossil bird. It was first classified by Davies as belonging to a three-toe ratite similar to but distinct from emus and cassowaries, with a closer resemblance to the latter. Lydekker agreed with this classification when he named it as its own genus and included it within the family Casuariidae. However, when the fossil was later examined by ornithologist Percy Lowe in 1929, he concluded that the bone was certainly not from a bird and instead most likely belonged to a crocodilian. He based this conclusion through comparisons of the bone to those of ratites and a crocodile, and found Hypselornis to resemble those of crocodiles in a number of ways. The bone is much more proportionately stout compared to those of ratites, and its asymmetry is also inconsistent with the toe bones of ratites. Furthermore, it does not taper towards its tip as it would in most ratites, and is instead constricted in its centre like that of a crocodile's. Rowe further identified six more details of the bone that were inconsistent with ratites but similar to those of crocodiles. However, he was unable to perform a more conclusive diagnosis of Hypselornis without further comparison to other fossil Indian crocodilians. This re-identification has since been maintained by later authors.

He had a long career serving in the field in the Second Anglo-Afghan War and in the 1884 Nile Expedition. He later became a staff officer and served as Deputy Assistant Adjutant General for intelligence in the Second Boer War. Granet became military attach√© to the British Embassy in Rome and Berne in 1911 and played a vital role in providing military intelligence out of Switzerland at the start of the First World War. At his instigation an air raid was carried out by British forces from southern France against a German hydrogen factory and zeppelin depot near to the Swiss border. This was successfully carried out and resulted in severe damage to the facility. Granet returned to action in 1915 commanding the artillery of the 11th (Northern) Division at Gallipoli. On 13 August that year he was severely wounded by an enemy shell. Granet was subsequently placed on half-pay (retirement) due to the severity of his injuries but returned to duty in 1917 when he was re-appointed as military attach√© to Berne. He died of his earlier wounds in Switzerland on 22 October 1918, becoming the last British general to die from enemy action in the war.  Early life and career  Granet was born in August 1858 and was the son of William Augustus Granet of Genoa, Kingdom of Sardinia.Harold Hartley, ‚ÄòGranet, Sir (William) Guy (1867‚Äì1943)‚Äô, rev. Mark Pottle, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 3 April 2016 His brother Sir Guy Granet was a barrister and high ranking railway administrator. Granet was educated at Eton College before joining the British Army's Royal Artillery as a lieutenant in 1878. He served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War between 1879 and 1880 and in the 1884 Nile Expedition. He married Evelyn Pulch√©rie Chapman (1864‚Äì1933) in 1885. Granet was promoted to captain on 29 July 1886. He was seconded from his regiment to the general staff on 1 January 1892, returning on 31 October 1895. Granet was appointed brigade major of the Royal Artillery's Southern district on 18 August 1896 and received promotion to the substantive rank of major on 7 September of that year. Granet was promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant- colonel on 29 November 1900. Granet served in the Second Boer War and was mentioned in dispatches on 2 April 1901 by British commander, Lord Roberts. He was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG) for intelligence on 28 April 1901 and held that position until 1902. He was in London for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra on 9 August 1902 and formed part of the King's procession. Granet served with the Army headquarters from 1902 as DAAG and received promotion to the substantive rank of lieutenant- colonel on 9 December 1903. He was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel on 31 July 1904 and returned to the Royal Artillery on 2 April 1905. Granet returned to Army headquarters on 17 November 1906 when he was appointed Assistant Director Remounts (i.e. the supply of horses) and promoted to the substantive rank of colonel. He remained in this role until 17 November 1910 when he was placed on half-pay. Granet was appointed military attach√© to the British Embassy in Rome and Berne on 23 February 1911. He was appointed a companion of the Order of the Bath on 19 June 1911 in the Coronation Honours.  First World War  After the outbreak of the First World War Granet's position as attach√© became important for intelligence gathering, particularly in Switzerland where he was the primary source of military intelligence in the country. Early in the war he proposed that an air raid be carried out on the German hydrogen factory and zeppelin sheds at Friedrichshafen, near to the Swiss border. This was approved and the subsequent raid was made on 21 November 1914. This was carried out by four British aircraft (Avro 504s) shipped by crate to an airfield in Belfort, France. One plane was damaged on takeoff but the remainder survived German AA fire to drop nine bombs on the facility, for the cost of one aircraft shot down and one pilot captured; the remaining pilots returned safely to Belfort and were awarded the Legion of Honour ‚Äì the aircraft were shipped back to England shortly afterwards. The hydrogen factory was said to be wrecked and a zeppelin was recorded as probably destroyed, with the raid described by historian Martin Gilbert as a \\"remarkable feat of aerial initiative\\". A complaint was received from Switzerland that their territory had been overflown but this was strongly denied by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill. A further complaint regarding the loss of a Swiss citizen working at the factory was dismissed by Churchill who said that \\"it serves him right\\". Although substantial damage was claimed at the time and in some later histories,Hilary St. George Saunders: Per Ardua: The Rise of British Airpower 1911‚Äì1939, Oxford University Press, 1944. the damage inflicted was slight. Granet's appointment as military attach√© ended in January 1915 and he returned to the Royal Artillery, where he was appointed to the temporary rank of brigadier-general on 18 March and given command of the artillery units of the 11th (Northern) Division. He fought with his unit at Gallipoli later that year. Whilst in a trench at Lala Baba Hill on 13 August he was badly wounded in the hands and face by gravel from an exploding Turkish shell. The shell is thought to have been a stray, falling short of its intended target ‚Äì the British fleet in Suvla Bay. Granet was evacuated and returned to half-pay on 7 November 1916 owing to the severity of his wounds. He was appointed an officer of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus by the Italian king and on 26 May 1917 was authorised to wear the decorations of that order by George V. Granet recovered enough to be reappointed as military attach√© to Berne on 4 June 1917. He died of his wounds on 22 October 1918 and was buried initially at Schosshalden cemetery in Berne but after the war he was reburied, with other British service dead from elsewhere in Switzerland in the Commonwealth war graves plot in St Martin's Cemetery, Vevey (Plot 53, Grave 60A).https://www.cwgc.org/find- war-dead/casualty/473455/granet,-edward-john/ He was the last British general to die as a result of enemy action during the war, which ended on 11 November 1918.Maddocks and Davies enumerate all 77 British general officers who they consider were killed or died due to enemy action during the war and Granet has the latest date of death.

If all you're going to do is sail around the pond on balmy days, its probably fine for that. A serious deep water sailor she's not. This is a price boat, and there's altogether too much that you don't get for what you don't pay, for any serious sailor to take the Hunter 28 seriously. There's a good reason why first impressions should be taken seriously, too. What you don't pay for up front will surely be heavily loaded on the back end. Count on it ...

While studying at Trinity, he played rugby union for Dublin University Football Club. His performances led to his selection for Ireland in 1908, He played two Test matches in the Home Nations Championship against England at Richmond, and Wales at Belfast. He played club cricket for Clontarf, after he was persuaded to join over rivals Pembroke by the club. After graduating from Trinity with an engineering degree, Aston's work took him to different parts of the British Empire. He worked on reconstruction of the Mandalay Canal in Burma in 1917, and served in the British Indian Army during World War I as a lieutenant in the cavalry reserve. By the mid-1920s, Aston was an executive engineer with the Burma Public Works Department. He still played cricket when working in Burma, playing two first-class matches against the Marylebone Cricket Club in January 1927 at Rangoon; the first came for Rangoon Gymkhana at the Gymkhana Ground, while the second came for Burma at the BAA Ground. He scored 32 runs in these matches, as well as taking 2 wickets. He later returned to Ireland, where he took up rugby refereeing and golf. He worked on the River Shannon at Limerick as a river inspector, before resigning in 1936 to move to Dublin to work alongside his brother at his engineering firm, taking over as chairman upon his death. Aston died at Rathcoole in Leinster in January 1968. He was survived by his wife (who died just six weeks later), two daughters and one son. His brother, John Aston, also played first-class cricket.

Notch Hill is high and was named in May 1881 by Captain John Fiot Lee Pearse Maclear (Royal Navy) of HMS Alert because, when viewed from the east, the peak appears to have a notch. Mount Merkara is and was also named by Maclear in May 1881 after the RMS Merkara which they met on its first voyage as part of the Queensland Royal Mail Line between Australia and London. The mountain Mount Rooper is and named in 1932 by Lieutenant Commander C.G. Little (Royal Australian Navy) during a survey.

Early life and education Jones was born and raised in Middlesboro, Kentucky; his mother practiced law in nearby Pineville, serving as the Commonwealth Attorney for Bell County. Jones attended Transylvania University on a full scholarship before receiving a scholarship to Duke Law School, where he graduated second in his class. After graduation from Duke, Jones returned to Lexington to practice law and began Kentucky Sports Radio. Career After graduating from Duke Law School, Jones returned to Kentucky to practice law before founding Kentucky Sports Radio (colloquially known by its initials \\"KSR\\"), a website and radio show dedicated to sports coverage involving the University of Kentucky Wildcats, in 2005. Jones bounced around several smaller radio shows before then launching KSR as a radio show in 2010. The radio show's flagship stations are WKJK in Louisville and WLAP in Lexington and is syndicated to 50 radio stations in 37 markets in Kentucky and surrounding states. From September 2016 until July 2019, Jones also hosted \\"Hey Kentucky!\\", a nightly sports and news recap program on WLEX-TV in Lexington, since also syndicated to WBNA in Louisville. On \\"Hey Kentucky!\\", Jones was joined nightly by rotating co-hosts, with some overlap with the KSR radio show. Jones and KSR also oversee a small network of podcasts based on the KSR brand and featuring personalities from both the KSR website and radio show. Since founding Kentucky Sports Radio, Jones has used his media platform to discuss both sports and politics. In 2014, he hosted live one-on-one conversations with both incumbent then-Senate Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell and his challenger Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. The conversation with Grimes on September 25 lasted 20 minutes and was called by The Daily Beast as \\"perhaps her most substantive interview.\\" Unlike Grimes, whose interview was in-studio, McConnell's interview was a spur-of-the-moment, unannounced phone call to the program two weeks later that was described as \\"emotional and combative.\\" The next year, Jones hosted a Republican gubernatorial primary debate between the four candidates vying to win the Republican nomination for Kentucky Governor. Jones has stated that he thinks this debate, three weeks before the primary election, contributed to Matt Bevin's 86 vote primary victory. Jones was also selected as the emcee for the annual Fancy Farm political picnic in August 2015. These forays into politics have led many to speculate that Jones might one day run for office. He was courted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to run for the 6th district U.S. House seat occupied by Representative Andy Barr in 2016 but ultimately declined to run. Jones had gone so far as to attend a \\"boot camp\\" for potential Democratic candidates in Washington, D.C. during the lead-in to the House race, but the experience left him disillusioned with the national Democratic Party. In a 2018 interview for Politico Magazine, he recalled one prominent member of Congress telling the attendees that positions on issues were far less important than campaign fundraising; Jones would call this \\"one of the most depressing things [he'd] ever heard.\\" He had also considered running for the U.S. Senate seat held by McConnell in 2020, but announced on November 15, 2019 that he would not enter the race. This public flirtation with the 2020 U.S. Senate race caused WLEX to permanently remove him from his role as host of \\"Hey Kentucky!‚Äù.WDRB, 'Matt Jones off Kentucky TV show while he mulls Senate race,' Jul 17, 2019 https://www.wdrb.com/news/matt-jones-off-kentucky-tv-show-while-he-mulls- senate/article_7fc68663-d7dd-5c32-ab00-5412f124cd62.html On August 15, Jones announced that he had been approached to write a book and had accepted. The book, tentatively titled Mitch, Please!, would take him around all of Kentucky's 120 counties in order to make his case that Sen. McConnell had failed the citizens of Kentucky. In response, the next day, Jones announced that WLEX had permanently ended his run as host of \\"Hey Kentucky!\\" The aforementioned Politico story added, While Jones identifies as a progressive, Politico has said that he \\"espouses a doctrine of empathy that you won‚Äôt hear from many liberals today.\\" Jones has said \\"I wish the people that I love didn‚Äôt like Donald Trump, but I understand why they do,\\" and claims to regularly talk to more conservatives than any other progressive in the U.S., estimating that 80% of his listeners voted for Trump in 2016. Jones' criticism of Kentucky political figures is not limited to Republicans; he has publicly labeled the state's Democratic Party as \\"a disaster\\". At a Democratic banquet held the night before the 2016 Fancy Farm picnic, he blasted the party for abandoning working-class voters, focusing on liberal strongholds in Louisville and Lexington, and compromising on core values to appeal to conservatives. In addition to the radio show, website, and televised program, Jones also started a sports bar in Lexington that is modeled after the KSR brand called Kentucky Sports Bar & Grille, colloquially known as \\"KSBar\\".

These accusations were followed by the disassociation of numerous state chapters. By December 2018, The New York Times reported that \\"charges of anti- Semitism are now roiling the movement and overshadowing plans for more marches.\\" News reports from across North America noted that turnout for the 2019 Women's March was lower compared to previous years, with potential reasons being poor weather, a decline in interest and controversy over protest organization in the United States with the controversies involving the March's leadership.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/07/this- is-what-we-learned-by-counting-the-womens-marches/ Although the third Women's March was significantly smaller than the previous years, thousands of people all across the U.S. still decided to partake in the march. Controversy surrounding national organizers Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, Bob Bland, and Carmen Perez are the co-chairs of Women's March, Inc., which represents and coordinates various Women's March events nationally. In 2018 Sarsour announced that the principal march sponsored by the national organization would take place in Washington, D.C. In November 2018, media outlets reported on calls for the four co-chairs to resign for failing to denounce Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. The Daily Beast traced the controversy to February 2018, when Mallory attended a Nation of Islam Saviours' Day event hosted by Farrakhan, during which he referred to the \\"Satanic Jew\\" and declared that \\"the powerful Jews are my enemy.\\" The Daily Beast later reported that the Women's March appeared to be losing support, as the number of sponsors dropped from 550 in 2017 to just 200 in 2019. The attendance at the 2019 March also experienced a steep decline. In October 2018, actress Alyssa Milano, who spoke at the 2018 Women's March, told The Advocate that she has refused to participate in the 2019 March unless Mallory and Sarsour condemned what have been described as homophobic, anti-Semitic, and transphobic comments by Farrakhan. The Women's March released a statement about anti-Semitism, defending Sarsour and Mallory. In November 2018, Teresa Shook, the co-founder of the Women's March, called for march organizers Bland, Mallory, Sarsour and Perez to resign, saying, \\"they have allowed anti-Semitism, anti-LBGTQIA sentiment and hateful, racist rhetoric to become a part of the platform by their refusal to separate themselves from groups that espouse these racist, hateful beliefs.\\"'Hateful and Racist' Women's March Founder Calls on Leaders to Resign, Citing anti-Semitism and Homophobia, Haaretz, Allison Kaplan Sommer, November 20, 2018 The organization's leadership rebuffed calls to step down; Sarsour's initial response alleged that criticisms were motivated by racism and her opposition to Israel. Sarsour later issued a statement that apologized to the March's supporters for its \\"slow response\\" and condemned anti-Semitism. In December 2018, Tablet published an article by Leah McSweeney and Jacob Siegel alleging that during the first meeting between Bland, Mallory, Perez, and others in the days after the 2016 US Presidential election, Mallory and Perez repeated an anti-Semitic canard promoted in Farrakhan's book The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews telling fellow organizer Vanessa Wruble, who is Jewish, that Jews were leaders in the American slave trade and are especially responsible for subsequent exploitation of racial minorities. Wruble suggested that Mallory and Perez had berated her for her Jewish heritage, saying \\"your people hold all the wealth.\\" Mallory denied Wruble's account but acknowledged telling \\"white women\\" at the meeting, including Wruble, that she \\"did not trust them.\\" Speakers and participating officials Noted speakers at various events included New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, congresswoman Ayanna Pressley and congresswoman Barbara Lee. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also joined marchers in San Francisco as well as mayor Eric Garcetti on the march in Los Angeles. Representative Katie Hill also took the stage in the Los Angeles March. Celebrities that also spoke were actress, chair, and Artist Table of Women's March on Washington, America Ferrera as well as actress and activist, Scarlett Johansson. Abby Stein, Rev. Jacqui Lewis, and Remaz Abdelgader on stage at the 2019 Women's March  Sponsorships  Sponsors included Scotch whiskey company Johnnie Walker, ice cream Ben and Jerry's, and German marketing firm Echte Liebe. In January 2019, organizations including the Democratic National Committee, the Southern Poverty Law Center and EMILY's List withdrew from the list of Women's March sponsors, shrinking the list of over 500 partner organizations by almost half. Other sponsors who withdrew their support include the NAACP, Emily‚Äôs List, NARAL, the National Abortion Federation, the AFL-CIO, the SEIU and its health-care union 1199SEIU, GLAAD, the Human Rights Campaign, Center for American Progress, and National Resources Defense Council. On January 13, 2019, Haaretz reported that only two Jewish groups sponsored the March, \\"after a long list backed the march in previous years.\\" The New Wave Feminists, a group against abortion, joined in this year‚Äôs March, despite being removed as a partner before the 2017 March.  The Women's Agenda  A month prior to the 2019 Women's March, the Women‚Äôs March organization posted an agenda of its goals for the 2019 March. The organization named it the Women‚Äôs Agenda. This is the first federal policy platform the organization has created. On the same day the Agenda was posted, the organizers also announced the date of the 2019 March. Website viewers have the ability to digitally endorse the agenda. The organization involved 70 movement leaders to develop this agenda that includes 24 federal policies believed to be essential. Some of these policies include: ending violence against women and femmes, ending state violence, immigrant rights, disability rights, racial justice, environmental justice and LGBTQIA‚Äôs rights. For more in-depth information, the organization has provided a 71 page document that deeply examines each of the 24 goals. Each of the goal‚Äôs sections highlights the theory of change that will be used in order to achieve it. Many of the 24 essential goals have more than one policy goal. Regional marches=Alabama= Birmingham Women's March was dedicated to people of color. The march focused on black women's wellness to connect them with resources for their mental and physical health. =California= Leaders of the Los Angeles March disavowed any relationship with the national organization. The Humboldt County March, held in Eureka, California, was canceled due to the organizers' concern that the March would reflect the population of the County by being, \\"overwhelmingly white,\\" thereby failing to represent \\"several perspectives in our community.\\" Humboldt County is about 74 percent non-Hispanic white; thus, commentators argued over the necessity to cancel a march whose participating audience‚Äôs demographic was reflective of the population. The Eureka march was rescheduled by a different group of organizers including former Eureka city councilwoman Linda Atkins. While some local groups boycotted the march, it was held in Eureka on Saturday, January 19, 2019, according to an article in the Times Standard on January 16, 2019. In response to the cancellation of the Women‚Äôs March in Eureka, the Eureka group said it was considering holding an event in March to celebrate International Women‚Äôs Day, which is on March 8. In the Bay Area, marches took place in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Santa Rosa, Alameda, Tri-Valley, Walnut Creek, Napa, Vallejo and Petaluma. San Francisco's Women's March turnout was \\"among the largest in the nation,\\" according to local Bay Area news station KRON4. March organizers in Santa Rosa asserted independence and disaffiliation from the national Women's March in Washington, citing concerns of antisemitism at the national level. Women's March Contra Costa (Walnut Creek) also denied affiliation with the national movement. Women‚Äôs March in Vallejo, California was among the first to raise concerns in July 2018, and also distanced itself. In Southern California, marches had an aura of celebration to them as participants had claimed recent victories in the 2018 midterm election where Republican strongholds such as Orange County had turned blue and elected more women than ever before to Congress. The Los Angeles march was organized by Women's March LA, an organization unaffiliated with the national organization Women's March, Inc. Emiliana Guereca, cofounder of the local Los Angeles march, distanced her march from the rhetoric of Louis Farrakhan and the behavior of the organizers of the national Women's March.\\"AJC Hosts L.A.

A man attending the rally alleges he was sexually assaulted by a woman in an incident partially caught on camera. The woman was later charged with misdemeanor sex abuse. =Illinois= The organizers of the Women's March Chicago announced they had canceled plans for a march in January 2019, citing high costs. They denied that the decision was in response to the controversy over antisemitism in the national movement but called the opportunity to distance itself from the national leadership a \\"side benefit.\\" Instead they planned a \\"day of service\\".AB7 7, youtube.com A small march of \\"several hundred\\" was organized independently. =Louisiana= The New Orleans March was canceled in early January 2019 over the allegations of antisemitism against the national leadership. In a statement, the chapter said, \\"The controversy is dampening efforts of sister marches to fundraise, enlist involvement, find sponsors and attendee numbers have drastically declined this year. New Orleans is no exception.\\" =Michigan= In December 2018, some leaders of the Michigan March disaffiliated themselves from the national organization and urged fellow activists to do the same. The 2019 March in Michigan was different from previous years' Marches, which had taken place at the Michigan Capitol building. The organizers chose to move the March to Detroit, hoping to make the March more accessible via metro, \\"especially [to] communities of color and people who may not have any means of driving to Lansing.\\" =Nebraska= The Women's March on Lincoln 2019 was rescheduled to Sunday, January 27 in downtown Lincoln, due to weather. Women's March participants in New York City. = New York City = In November, organizers of the annual New York City March, the Women's March Alliance, which organized the New York Marches in 2017 and 2018, and held a permit for a January 19, 2019, march, objected to the efforts of the national group led by Sarsour, Women's March, Inc., to take control of the 2019 New York City March. March Alliance organizer Katherine Siemionko said that her group had lost \\"thousands\\" of followers on social media and donors and that well known people had turned down invitations to speak at the march. The Alliance, the sole group with a permit to march, started at 72nd Street and Central Park West and marched to 44th St. By December, the New York March had split into two marches, one affiliated with the national group, and the other led by March On,March On a group created by multiple sister march organizers and led by Vanessa Wruble, co-founder and Head of Campaign Operations of the 2017 Women's March, who left the group and charges that the national organizers made antisemitic assertions during the organizing effort for the founding event. The newer New York City Women's March, affiliated with Sarsour and Mallory's Washington D.C.-based organization, had a permit for a \\"rally\\" in the park at Foley Square. = Philadelphia = Women in Philadelphia organized two separate marches, one was Philadelphia's Women's March chapter that is affiliated with the Washington, D.C. based organization, and the other independent of it. The independent march was organized by Philly Women Rally. The Women's March affiliated with the Women's March organization took place at LOVE Park and the other march started at Logan Square. =Washington= The Washington state Women's March voted to discontinue the Tacoma march due to disagreement of the support given by the national leadership to Farrakhan. The Spokane, Washington march attracted 8,000 in 2017 and 6,000 in 2018. Angie Beem, leader of the Washington state March and a President of the Board of Women's March Washington, criticized the March's national leaders and said of the organization \\"continuing to be a part of the Women's March with the blatant bigotry they display would be breaking a promise. We can't betray our Jewish community by remaining a part of this organization.\\" References External links  * Womens March 2019 in American politics 2019 in women's history 2019 protests Antisemitism in the United States Fourth-wave feminism History of women's rights January 2019 events in the United States Women's marches 2019 2019 Women's March ","title":"2019 Women's March"},{"id":"59002693","text":"Barbary or Barbary Coast or Barbary states is the term used by Europeans from the 16th century until the 19th century to refer to the coastal regions of what are now Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya.

During a brief career, Brooks was a two-time All-Around Cowboy champion, winning the honor in consecutive years in 1943 and 1944. In addition, he won four season discipline championships. After his retirement following his second All-Around title, he went into ranching. Brooks was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1991. Biography Born in Fletcher, Oklahoma, on December 9, 1916, Brooks was raised in Washington County. At the age of 2, Brooks' father died; his grandparents raised him. He worked on local ranches during his early years, and at one point spent time in New Mexico. Brooks left high school to embark on a ranching career, and entered a rodeo for the first time when he was 20 years old. Around 1940, Brooks was actively participating professionally in rodeo events, which were under the organization of the RAA. In 1942, Brooks led the RAA in season earnings in the bareback riding discipline. His winnings of $1,925 were $37 higher than the number-two bareback rider of that year, Hank Mills, and were enough for him to claim his first discipline championship. In all disciplines, Brooks earned $5,757 that year, finishing fifth in the All-Around Cowboy standings. Early in his career, he often participated in calf roping, along with the riding events. Later, he dropped calf roping events from his schedule to focus on the riding disciplines, and said that after this decision, his \\"bareback and saddle bronc riding improved 40 percent in 30 days.\\" The season-long performances of Brooks in 1943 earned him the All-Around Cowboy championship of the RAA. His overall earnings of $6,924 were more than $400 greater than the second-place cowboy, Homer Pettigrew. In addition, Brooks claimed the 1943 saddle bronc riding title, with $4,571 of his earnings in that field. Entering the 1944 rodeo season, Brooks had developed a heart condition and, according to his wife, had been told that he would have to change careers if he still wanted to be alive on his 30th birthday. Brooks told his wife that he would quit competing in rodeo if he claimed a second straight All-Around Cowboy title. With $11,064 in earnings, more than $800 ahead of second place Gene Rambo, he did repeat as the RAA's All-Around Cowboy champion, becoming the first cowboy ever to do so. Of that total, $4,802 came in saddle bronc riding, which was enough for Brooks to win the season title in that field for the second consecutive year. In addition, Brooks' $3,852 of bareback riding earnings gave him that discipline's season championship; that amount was $1,500 more than Bill Linderman, the runner-up, made for the year. The two discipline titles and All-Around honors gave Brooks a \\"triple crown\\" for the season. Brooks did retire from competition after 1944, but served as the Rodeo Cowboys Association's vice president in 1945. He became a rancher and relocated to Texas, where he and his family helped to grow thoroughbreds, quarter horses, and cattle. On August 6, 1983, Brooks died of cancer in Stephenville, Texas; he was 66 years old. He was buried in Nolan County, at Brooks Ranch Cemetery. Brooks was inducted into the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum's Rodeo Hall of Fame in 1955, and the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1991. His championships are recognized by the modern Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.

This project, initially meant to be called Banco Comercial do Norte was led by Am√©rico Amorim, Ant√≥nio Gon√ßalves e Macedo Silva and it eventually became known as Portuguese Commercial Bank, officially created in 1985. Jardim Gon√ßalves was made President of the bank since its creation, subsequently gaining control of the Banco Portugu√™s do Atl√¢ntico, in 1995, of the Bank Mello, of the Insurance Company Imp√©rio and of the Bank Pinto & Sotto Mayor, in 2000. Jardim Gon√ßalves became, during the late 1990s regarded as one of the most influential and powerful businessmen in Portugal. Jardim Gon√ßalves left the Presidency of the Board at the Portuguese Commercial Bank in March 2005 being succeeded in his position by jurist Paulo Teixeira Pinto. In 2008 Jardim Gon√ßalves was forced to leave the bank altogether after a high-profile controversial conflict between shareholders that also led to the departure of Teixeira Pinto.  Controversy  In 2010 he was fined in one million euros by the Banco de Portugal, after revelation of nine financial infractions on his part. = Retirement pension = Another controversy about Jardim Gon√ßalves was the publicizing of his retirement pension that the Portuguese Commercial Bank bought for him from an insurance company to compensate him after his departure from the bank, since the bank's board members do not have the same privilege. The pension got national media attention because of its extravagance consisting of a monthly allowance of 174 857.83 euros and the right to the use of 4 bodyguards and two cars for their transportation as well as use of a private jet and 5 luxury cars with 2 paid-for drivers  Issue  In 1962 Jorge Jardim Gon√ßalves married Maria d'Assun√ß√£o Almeida Os√≥rio de Vasconcelos (Oporto, 17 April 1934) daughter of Fernando Os√≥rio de Vasconcelos (1911‚Äì1997) and his wife Albertina Augusta de Almeida (1906‚Äì1966),\\"√Årvores de Costados\\", Embaixador Jos√© Ant√≥nio Moya Ribera, Dislivro Hist√≥rica Lisboa, 2005, √Årv. 20 with whom he has two daughters and three sons: * Maria Lu√≠sa Os√≥rio de Vasconcelos Jardim Gon√ßalves * Jorge Alberto Os√≥rio de Vasconcelos Jardim Gon√ßalves * Maria Sofia Os√≥rio de Vasconcelos Jardim Gon√ßalves (Luanda, 13 August 1964), married to Jo√£o Afonso Calainho de Azevedo Teixeira Duarte (Lisbon, 14 May 1963), of whom she has 14 children. * Filipe Manuel Os√≥rio de Vasconcelos Jardim Gon√ßalves * Rodrigo Jos√© Os√≥rio de Vasconcelos Jardim Gon√ßalves married to Joana Mantero Bilbao do Nascimento with whom he has 2 children.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History When Owosso was established, most of the growth occurred in an area around the Shiawassee River. However, in 1856 the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway arrived in the city, followed by two more lines by 1867. By the 1880s, a fourth line was added, and the southwest part of Owosso became a busy hub of railway infrastructure. Manufacturers soon realized that locating near the lines would reduce transportation costs, and their workers established neighborhoods near the new factories. To serve these new neighborhoods, a small commercial district sprang up on Main Street. Description he West Town Historic District is commercial and industrial area, containing 35 buildings. Thirteen of these date from between 1856 and the 1890, and fifteen more date from the turn of the century to the Great Depression. Of the remainder, all but two fit the scale and architectural feel of the district. The commercial portion of the district along Main Street are primarily two-story brick store buildings, ornamented with cast iron, tin, stone, and tile details. Earlier buildings are mostly Italianate in design. Later buildings are more streamlined in design.

He won awards and recognition for the campaign.Travel by Train, p. 109 He worked in Illinois. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.  Early life and education  William Peter Welsh was born to Bartholomew J. Welsh and Sara Ellen Cunningham King Welsh in Lexington, Kentucky. He was one of six children, four boys and two girls: an older brother, King; a sister, Agatha; Welsh; twins Barry and August (Gus); and Marguerite. Welsh attended Saint Paul's, a boys- only school taught by nuns. School for him started at 7:30 a.m. and he attended Mass each day before class. Welsh's father, Bartholomew, died of cancer following a three-year bout with an aneurism that finally burst. Welsh was three years old, when his father developed the aneurism. After his father's death, his mother Sara supported the children by living in boarding homes that belonged to relatives and friends so she could work and earn money. Welsh took his first job, a summer position at the Lexington Leader, at age 12 making $2 a week. His boss, Sam Roberts, fired him after the summer so he could return to school. At age 14, he started working at the Kaufman Clothing Company in Lexington where he was soon promoted and made $3 a week, and later $6. His boss at this store, Phil Strauss, would prove influential in his success as an artist.Welsh, W. (1982). William P. Welsh, painter and patriot : An oral history. Lexington, Ky.: William P. Welsh Society.  Ella Williams School for Girls  When Welsh was 15, he began studying under Mary Kinkead, his first painting teacher, at the Ella Williams School for Girls in Lexington. He was one of only a few boys who attended. It was here that he met Henrietta Clay. They were later sweethearts and engaged. After Clay ended their engagement for another man, they remained good friends. In his oral history account, Welsh credited his time at Ella Williams studying under Kinkead as what would inspire him to travel abroad and study art.  Academie Julien and Atelier Delecleuse in Paris  Welsh got into Academie Julien and Atelier Delecleuse in Paris, France thanks to a connection of his Lexington art teacher, Mary Kinkead. His boss at the Kaufman Clothing Company, Phil Strauss, funded Welsh's time in Paris with a monthly check of $40 because he trusted Mart Kinkead's judgement that Welsh was suited for Paris. After he returned from Europe, he spent two years in Lexington doing odd art jobs and sports activities at a YMCA. He then went to New York to pursue art. He had a promise of $25 a week in New York for working in George Ford Morris's studio (Morris was a New York horse painter). While in New York, he worked and attended the Arts Student League.  Military service  Welsh first enlisted in the Army in 1914 at the First New York Field Artillery, Battery B as a private despite only have one good eye (his left). His first field experience was in 1916 during his time serving with General Pershing in the Mexican Border Campaign in search of Pancho Villa. He never encountered Villa. After his Mexican Border tour of duty, he went overseas with his regiment and served in Brittany, Brest. Here his French language skills, acquired during his art school days in Paris, made him invaluable to his regiment. After Brest, he was shipped to Bordeaux to a camp called Desseus. Soon after, his French language skills grabbed the attention of his superiors, along with his artistic training, and he was transferred to Langres, where he worked with a camouflage unit. Later, during the second world war, Welsh joined again, this time at age 52. He again worked in camouflage, this time in charge of a St. Louis unit for a short time. He was later an executive officer in the same unit to his replacement officer, a younger man named Austin who was 35 and sent from Washington to replace Welsh. A young William Welsh in uniform during World War I  Japan  During World War II, while in his 50s, Welsh received a commission to use his art skills to document the war. Welsh landed in Japan in October 1945 and left in July 1946 after the military requested that he go overseas and paint and draw images for historical war records. He chose the Japanese theater and spent ten months drawing and painting the destruction and beauty he found in the country. He completed ten paintings while there. He would later give presentations and speeches about his time in Japan to various clubs in Kentucky. Pictures of his Japanese paintings appeared in newspapers across several states such as the Louisville Courier-Journal, the Chicago Tribune, the Lexington Herald-Leader, and others.

Tempo (in Indonesian). Retrieved November 8, 2018. also known as the Tarbiyah movementSalman, 2006. or the Dakwah movement,Salman, 2006. p.184. is an Islamic religious movement based in Indonesia. Jemaah Tarbiyah was an active movement during the 1980s to 1990s and consisted of university students, aimed at the religious education and da'wah (proselytizing). The movement is considered to be influenced by the teaching of Muslim Brotherhood. It is considered an important influence for Islamization of Indonesia. The movement became the bedrock of the Islamist party Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) which was founded in 2002. Etymology The term tarbiyah () means \\"intensive Islamic education\\" or \\"disciplining\\" in Arabic.Van Bruinessen, 2013. Initially, the term was mainly used by outsiders to designate the particular phenomenon and activities conducted by certain groups. There has been no formal consensus on the naming by the activists of the movement. Tarbiyah is often used by Indonesian Islamic higher educational institutions as a name of faculties specialized in religious education. The term was also used by a socio-religious organization Union of Islamic Education (Persatuan Tarbiyah Islam, PERTI) established in 1928. The usage of tarbiyah in the context of Jemaah Tarbiyah has no direct relations with any of the latter. History There had been a history of da'wah based on university campuses, notably of elite secular universities such as Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) since the 1970s. However, there was a demand for more comprehensive and systematic methods of da'wah, which was still very informal and strictly monitored by the Suharto regime. Some religious gatherings based in Salman Mosque of ITB is considered as one of many origins of Jemaah Tarbiyah. These religious gatherings put particular emphasis on specific attitudes toward basic Islamic teachings and interpretations, including the principle of ukhuwah (brotherhood), dress code, and the prohibition on smoking.Damanik, 2016. Among the activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah, four Muslim students returned from the Islamic University of Madinah, Hilmi Aminuddin, Salim Segaf Aljufri, Abdullah Said Baharmus, and Acep Abdul Syukur, are considered as founding fathers (collectively called muassis). Facing demands of more systematic proselytization and religious education, these four students and their cohorts have articulated a comprehensive program and organized activities, improved with methodology from the Middle East which was often named as usrah system. Its religious gatherings were known as halaqah which involved mentoring and Qur'anic recitations. Since early to mid-1980s, the activity had quickly spread across elite secular universities, where religious education was required to be complemented. Jemaah Tarbiyah has often been pointed out of its Muslim Brotherhood influence.Nisa, 2018.Furkon, 2004. Usrah system was a training program of Muslim Brotherhood members, and the Tarbiyah movement had directly implemented the methodology. Activists of the Tarbiyah movement are also considered to be committed toward translation of books written by members of Muslim Brotherhood, including Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb. There is also an explanation that links Jemaah Tarbiyah to the Indonesian Islamic Dawaah Council (DDII), a conservative Islamic organization headed by Mohammad Natsir.Furkon, 2004. DDII had contributed to the constructions of mosques in the universities and was central to the importation of religious teachings from the Middle East. Some of the prominent activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah had DDII backgrounds. Throughout the 1980s, Jemaah Tarbiyah had managed to grow its influence underground, mostly due to its focus on religious issues and avoided political activism. The movement had also established formal institutions with similar aims but without explicit reference toward its connections. Such institutions include foundations like Nurul Fikri, Al-Hikmah Boarding School, and PA-HAM. In the 1990s, the movement had established influence over many intra-university student organizations and discussion forums. The movement accommodated various Islamic religious strands from traditionalist to modernists, and was fluid regarding pragmatic concerns such as political system. After the fall of Suharto and the beginning of the democratic transition, activists of the movement founded an Islamist political party Justice Party (PK) in 1998, and its successor Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) in 2002. Majority of the members of PK and PKS, including the first president of PK Nurmahmudi Ismail, were activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah. The establishment of a political party was chosen over the establishment of a formal socio-religious organization. The decision was supported by the majority of the activists. Main activities related to da'wah conducted during the Jemaah Tarbiyah era were succeeded by the political parties. Today, activists of Jemaah Tarbiyah have been continuously influencing the creation of new trends in da'wah and Islamic socio-religious movements, including One Day One Juz (ODOJ).

Van Rensselaer Cruger & Co. until the death of Stephen Van Rensselaer Cruger (a grandson of patroon Stephen Van Rensselaer) in 1898, at which point McVickar became the head of McVickar & Co., which later became known as the McVickar Realty Trust Company. The McVickar Realty Trust Company eventually merged with the Empire State Trust Company in 1904, emerging as the Empire Trust Company, of which Harry became First Vice President taking charge of the real estate department and president Leroy W. Baldwin taking hold of the banking end. He also served as a director of the Knickerbocker Trust Company and was the treasurer of Gaillard & Co. =Society life= In 1892, McVickar and his wife were both included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Harry was a member of the Century Association and the Lambs Club. Personal life On January 14, 1891, McVickar married socialite and painter Maud Robbins (d. 1955) at Grace Church before 2,000 people in a ceremony officiated by Bishop Henry C. Potter. She was the daughter of Henry Asher Robbins, an industrialist associated with the Waltham Watch Company, and Lizzie Pelham Bend Robbins. Her brother, the architect Harry Pelham Robbins, was married to Emily Frances Welles, the daughter of Benjamin Welles and sister of Sumner Welles, the Undersecretary of State in the Roosevelt administration. Emily and Sumner were grand-nieces and grand-nephews of Caroline Astor. McVickar died of pleurisy on July 4, 1905 at his father-in-law's residence, Asher House, in Southampton, New York. He contracted pleurisy \\"while he was automobiling in Europe\\" six weeks earlier. His widow remarried to Theron Roundell Strong, a nephew of mayor William L. Strong, in 1918 and later died at her residence in the Carlyle Hotel in December 1955.

In a 2018 publication a team of researchers announced to have found the then-oldest known work of figurative art in the world among the cave paintings, at 40,000 years old. However, the same team has since found and dated an elaborate therianthrope rock art panel in the Leang Bulu‚Äô Sipong 4 cave in Sulawesi's Maros-Pangkep karst to around 44,000 years old, older than the figurative art in Lubang Jeriji Sal√©h. Cave paintings The Lubang Jeriji Sal√©h site is one among many caves, embedded in the steep mountains of East Kalimantan. Its walls and ceiling covered with hundreds of outlines of hands and outstretched fingers inside bursts of red-orange ochre or iron oxide paint and figurative cave paintings. An updated analysis of the cave walls suggests, that the oldest of the finger stencils are 52,000 years old and the earliest actual painting, a depiction of a banteng bull, was created around 40,000 years ago, tens of thousands of years earlier than previous datings. The bull, that belongs to a trio of rotund bovine creatures is over across, and also made from reddish-orange ochre on the cave's limestone walls. Based on 2018 Uranium datings of small samples of the limestone crust, three phases of decoration were identified. The oldest contains the bull depiction and red-orange ochre hand stencils. During the second phase stencils in a mulberry colour along with intricate motifs and humans were created. Human figures, boats and geometric designs were identified as the work of the third and youngest phase. =Investigation= The Kalimantan caves were explored in 1994 and the paintings first spotted by French caver Luc-Henri Fage. The 2018 team of researchers and scientists, led by Maxime Aubert from the Griffith University, Australia and Pindi Setiawan from the Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia had investigated the site, identified and dated the rock paintings as the world's oldest known figurative art and published the results in the Nature journal by the end of the year. The team has since found and dated an elaborate therianthrope rock art panel in the Leang Bulu‚Äô Sipong 4 cave in Sulawesi, to around 44,000 years old, according to a 2019 publication. In order to date the paint pigments, the team applied Uranium series dating techniques on the calcium carbonate (limestone) particles which encrust the depictions. =Importance= The discovery of the cave paintings is important within human cultural history, as it adds to the view that cave art was created simultaneously in Southeast Asia and Europe. However, it is unknown which people created the paintings and what happened to them. Francesco d'Errico, an expert in prehistoric art at the University of Bordeaux, described the investigation as a \\"major archaeological discovery\\", but also suggested that the discovery offered little information on the geographical origins of art.

Henry Raup Wagner (September 27, 1862 ‚Äì March 27, 1957) was an American book collector, bibliographer, cartographer, historian, and business executive. He was the author of over 170 publications, including books and scholarly essays, mainly about the histories of the American frontier and the Spanish exploration and colonization of Mexico. He also assembled tens of thousands of books and manuscripts and formed several collections from them. Wagner was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 27, 1862. He graduated from Yale University in 1884 and then from Yale Law School in 1886. He went west and began settling in places like Kansas City and then Denver, where he became involved in the mining business. One of his first employers was the Globe Smelting and Refining Company. In 1892 they assigned him to Mexico where he began collecting books on metallurgy and became interested in the history of the region. From 1898, he began working for the Guggenheim family, who transferred him to Chile and then to New York. In 1903, he became the manager of their London office where he collected many more books on different subjects, including South American history and economics. The latter became the subject of his first bibliography, Irish Economics: 1700‚Äì1783. From 1906 to 1915, he managed the Guggenheims' affairs in Mexico, and was then transferred to Chile where he studied in writer Jos√© Toribio Medina's residence. By then Wagner was transitioning from book collecting to research and writing, and sold his large Mexican collection to the Yale University Library. He published The Plains and the Rockies in 1920 and quit his job the following year. Wagner helped revive the California Historical Society in 1922 and sold his last major book collection that year to the Huntington Library. The Spanish Southwest, 1542‚Äì1794 was published in 1924, and Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World, Its Aims and Achievements in 1926. He became interested in cartography around that time and worked for several years on that subject. The Cartography of the Northwest Coast of America to the Year 1800 was published in 1937. Later, between 1942 and 1944, Wagner wrote a series of books on 16th century Spanish conquistadors, notably Hern√°n Cort√©s who was the subject of The Rise of Fernando Cort√©s. Wagner married Blanche Henriette Collet in 1917. They initially settled in Berkeley, California, but after 1928 they lived in San Marino, California. He died on March 27, 1957, aged 94. The California Historical Society established the Henry R. Wagner Memorial Award in 1959. Early life and book collecting A photo portrait of Wagner from a 1914 book dedicated to the Yale class of 1884. Wagner was born on September 27, 1862, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and attended Friends High School there. His father, Jacob Frederick Wagner, was a businessman of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry; his mother, Eliza Kemp, was of English ancestry. He graduated from Yale University in 1884 and from Yale Law School in 1886. His father supported him financially, throughout his studies and afterwards, until the family lost its fortune in the Panic of 1893. Upon graduating, Wagner traveled west over the years that followed to places like Missouri, Colorado and New Mexico. His first major stop was Kansas City, Missouri, where he became interested in the ore mining business and the history of the American frontier. He later went to Denver to study the subject further. He collected mining statistics on the Comstock Lode for mining engineer Rossiter W. Raymond, a task that required him to travel to Virginia City, Nevada, and later to New York. Wagner then worked for the Denver-based Globe Smelting and Refining Company.; He traveled twice to Mexico between 1892 and 1893 while working for Globe. His first major book collection began during his first Mexican trip with a few works on metallurgy. He then worked there from 1894 for the equipment manufacturer Edward P. Allis Company. He managed one of its offices in Mexico while moving from place to place in the western United States from 1895 to 1898. During his stays in Durango and Zacatecas, Mexico, Wagner became interested in the history of the earlier forms of precious metal ore extraction in New Spain and began collecting books on the subject. His collection later included works on the general contributions of Spain to the New World. Among Wagner's stops on the west coast during his Mexican assignment were Seattle, at the beginning of the Klondike Gold Rush, and British Columbia. From 1898, he began working as an ore buyer for the Guggenheim family, representing their interests in Chile for four years and in New York after that.; In 1902, Daniel Guggenheim appointed him manager of the London office of the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO), then under partial Guggenheim control.; Wagner moved to the British capital in 1903 with his mother, who often traveled with him, and stayed with her in a house which she had helped secure. There, he collected many more books as a result of his frequent visits to book shops and auction halls. His London collections included works on the histories of Chile and Peru, mining, metallurgy, and economics. Economics attracted his attention at the time and contributed to his first bibliography, Irish Economics: 1700‚Äì1783, a Bibliography with Notes, which he privately printed in 1907. He had gathered up to 6,000 volumes about economics by the time he left England. He later gave this collection of works on Irish economics to the Yale University Library.; ; Wagner left London in 1906. ASARCO transferred him to Mexico and ran the company's affairs in that country from its regional office El Paso, Texas. He traveled frequently to central Mexico during the first few years and collected many more books on the history and literature of Mexico, and on South America. He relocated to Mexico City in 1910, a year that also marked the beginning of the Mexican Revolution. He witnessed some of the events that unfolded during that period and got to know many revolutionary leaders, including Pancho Villa. In 1915, Wagner moved to the Chilean capital, Santiago, as part of a two-year contract with the Guggenheims to run their affairs there. That year he also sold Yale's library his extensive Mexican collection for $20,000. The part of it relating to South America alone had up to 7,000 volumes, mainly on Chile. Shift to literary career The Plains and the Rockies, 1920 Wagner continued to collect books during his stay in Chile. He spent considerable time in the residence of Chilean bibliographer Jos√© Toribio Medina, time described by George P. Hammond in his obituary on Wagner as \\"some of his most pleasant hours\\". In 1918 he decided to devote most of his attention to writing on the subject of exploration in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. His research later materialized in one of his notable works, The Plains and the Rockies. First published in 1920, it quickly had an impact on the pricing and quality of books on that topic.; As he became more interested in history, Wagner considered detaching himself entirely from the Guggenheims' business world. He eventually quit his job in 1921 to dedicate most his time to historical research. According to Charles Lewis Camp, in 1922 Wagner played an important role in the revival of the California Historical Society, which had been defunct since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. He also founded its principal publication, the California Historical Society Quarterly. This gradual shift from one preoccupation to another coincided with a transition from book collecting to full-time research and writing. Yale's library bought his Texas and mid-west collections of over 2,000 works in 1919. In 1922 he sold the Huntington Library his last major collections on California. It had formed the basis of his California Imprints August 1846 June 1851 published that same year. He continued the practice of buying and selling old works, however, though to a lesser extent. Wagner then went on to complete The Spanish Southwest, 1542‚Äì1794, an Annotated Bibliography, inspired by his studies and findings in Medina's residence in Chile, which was published in 1924.; Around the same time he became interested in cartography and wrote an essay for the Quarterly on that subject in 1924. He also finished working on Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World, Its Aims and Achievements, a book published in 1926 which he referred to as his \\"first love\\", according to Thomas W. Streeter. It was one of the most extensive collections of material on Francis Drake's circumnavigation of the world in the 16th century. In it Wagner tried to debunk some of the common contemporary misconceptions about the nature of Drake's expedition.; He later became skeptical of Drake's Plate of Brass, a hoax that appeared in the 1930s. He took up the matter in person with historian Herbert Eugene Bolton, who had authenticated the plate and was at the center of the controversy surrounding it. Wagner then resumed his cartographic work. From 1927 onward, he wrote a series of seven essays for the Quarterly that consist mainly of translations of Spanish exploration logs about the western coasts of North America. These make up his Spanish Voyages to the Northwest Coast of America in the Sixteenth Century, published by the same journal in 1929. His studies on that topic eventually culminated with The Cartography of the Northwest Coast of America to the Year 1800 published by the University of California Press in 1937. It contained a lot of new information with hundreds of maps and is based largely on original sources. Later, returning to the subject of western printing and its history, he finished Mexican Imprints, 1544‚Äì1600 in 1939. That year he also printed the Spanish edition of his 1935 English language supplement to Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Icazbalceta's 1886 book, Bibliografia Mexicana del Siglo XIV. Wagner was an admirer of the Bibliografia and was contacted by a relative of Icazbalceta's who offered to help him with the translation. In 1942, the Cort√©s Society published Wagner's first two volumes in a series on Spanish conquistadors in the New World. The books covered Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba and Juan de Grijalva respectively. In 1944 the Society published The Rise of Fernando Cort√©s, a detailed examination of the life of Hern√°n Cort√©s and his campaigns against the Aztec Empire.; His Supplement to Icazbalceta's bibliography was eventually published in Mexico, in 1946, under the title Nueva Bibliograf√≠a Mexicana del Siglo XVI Suplemento a las Bibliograf√≠as de Don Joaquin Garc√≠a Icazbalceta, Don Jos√© Toribio Medina y Don Nicol√°s Le√≥n. Peter Pond, Yankee Fur Trader and Explorer, published in 1955, was one of Wagner's last books printed before his death. According to his associate Ruth Frey Axe, he thought highly of, and worked \\"unceasingly for twenty years\\" on The Life and Writings of Bartolom√© de las Casas. It was published posthumously in 1967. Personal life and death Upon returning from Chile, Wagner married Blanche Henriette Collet, a French painter, at a ceremony in Oakland on July 17, 1917, after which they settled in a house they had purchased in Berkeley, California. The couple stayed temporarily in New York from 1919 when Wagner was still working for the Guggenheims. They returned shortly afterwards to Berkeley where they lived until 1928, after which they moved to San Marino, California. Wagner gradually lost his eyesight during his final years but continued his research nonetheless with the assistance of Axe.; ; He died on March 27, 1957, in San Marino aged 94. His wife, Collet, died a few weeks later on May 16. Achievements and legacy Wagner is credited with 177 publications, as of Axe's 1968 update to the list of his published works. These include books and articles, most of which are compiled in three bibliographies of his work published during his lifetime. Two of these, published in 1934 and 1955, are both titled The Published Writings of Henry R. Wagner. The latter was published by the Zamorano Club and lists 167 titles. Another bibliography came in the form of a \\"Check List\\" at the end of his 1942 autobiography, Bullion to Books. In addition to those published pieces, many unpublished bibliographical and cartographic documents went to the Yale University Library over a fifty-year period. These included notes and correspondences with scholars, book collectors and learning institutions. Axe expected more works would be published in the years following her 1968 update.; In Sixty Years of Book Collecting, his autobiography published by the Zamorano Club in 1952, Wagner states that he owned up to 100,000 books and documents at various points in his life. These included about 600 works on metallurgy, about 10,000 on economics, and between 12- 13,000 works on the histories of Mexico and Texas, among others in his earlier collections.; In 1971, Archibald Hanna Jr., curator of the \\"Western Americana\\" section at the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library of Yale, wrote the following about Wagner's book collecting: \\"If Bancroft was in a sense the grandfather of western Americana collecting, the father was undoubtedly Henry Raup Wagner.\\" Wagner was granted fellowship by the Royal Geographical Society and received honorary degrees at Pomona College in 1935, Yale University in 1946, and the University of California in 1949.; He became a member of or helped found different historical societies and bibliophile clubs including: the California Historical Society, the Bibliographical Society of America, the American Antiquarian Society, the Grolier Club, the Book Club of California and the Zamorano Club, among others. Wagner also presided over the Historical Society of Southern California in 1933‚Äì34.; The California Historical Society established the Henry R. Wagner Memorial Award, its highest accolade, in 1959. It consists of a gold medal with Wagner's profile and is presented annually by a Wagner Awards Committee to individuals who have accomplished works relating to history, cartography and bibliography within the two years preceding the handing over ceremony. Its first recipient was Carl Irving Wheat, and then over the years to individuals like Dale Morgan in 1961, and George R. Stewart (tied) in 1972, among others. On the one hundredth anniversary of Wagner's birth in 1962, Thomas Streeter received the award for his Bibliography of Texas 1795‚Äì1845, which he had dedicated to Wagner, referring to him as \\"The Old Master\\".; ; ReferencesSources     Further reading External links *Guide to the Henry Raup Wagner Collection - Online Archive of California *Guide to the Henry Raup Wagner Papers, 1912-1957 - Online Archive of California *Henry Raup Wagner Papers.

It forms part of the family Tettigoniidae, the subfamily Listroscelidinae and the tribe Terpendrini, the gum-leaf katyatids. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Chlorobalius. Description The adult Chlorobalius leucoviridis is a large, cryptically-coloured, long-horned grasshopper. The body, wings and legs are barred and spotted in green and white. The legs bear short spines and both males and females have stridulatory organs, the male has a file-and-scraper structure on the tegmen (fore-wing) while the female has pegs on the hind wing which rub against certain veins on the fore-wing. Distribution and habitat Male Chlorobalius leucoviridis is native to arid, inland regions of Australia. It is typically found high in a large bush or small tree. Behaviour Chlorobalius leucoviridis is nocturnal and occurs in small groups which move from one location to another. It feeds by catching other insects such as flies, grasshoppers and other katydids, grasping the prey with its fore-legs or first two pairs of legs, and immobilising it by biting it under the throat. The spines on the legs seem to play a part in controlling larger prey items. The male makes loud, trilling songs to lead females of its own species towards its location. The male attracts male cicadas on which to feed by mimicry, luring them to its vicinity by deception. This is accomplished both acoustically, by audible wing-clicking in a pattern similar to that used by sexually-receptive female cicadas, and visually by the use of synchronised body movements similar to those exhibited by the females. Remarkably, the katydid has the ability to mimic the sounds and movements of a number of different prey species, even some species with which it has never had direct contact.

Swann is an Associate Professor of Atmospheric Sciences and Ecology at the University of Washington. Her research group focuses on questions that examine the interactions between plants and climate.  Early life and education  Swann grew up in Glen Ellen, CA and now resides in Seattle, WA. She received her bachelor's degree in earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. She then attended Columbia University for her master's degree in earth and environmental sciences. She returned to the University of California, Berkeley to complete her Ph.D. Her thesis advisor was Inez Fung. She was also a competitive youth and collegiate sailor, winning the US Sailing Junior Women's Doublehanded Championship (Ida Lewis Trophy) and the collegiate sailing Robert Hobbes Sportsmanship Award.  Career and research  Swann is an Associate Professor of Atmospheric Science and Ecology at the University of Washington. She uses climate models to simulate the way that plants influence earth's climate. She has made a number of discoveries about how changes in the biosphere may influence our climate. For example, she predicts that the addition of deciduous forests in the Arctic may cause warming both by reducing the amount of area covered by reflective ice and by increasing the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. While additional forests in mid latitudes across North America and Eurasia, may influence forests as far away as the tropics. Her group also examines how plants adapt to shifts in climate. For example, she found that plants use less water as CO2 increases, decreasing the severity of drought response and thus changing the way climate models should be built. Her findings on the influence of plants on the environment have been reported by Quanta Magazine, Geographical Magazine, Inside Science, and multiple UW News publications. Swann serves as a co-chair of the Biogeochemistry Working Group, Community Earth System Model, and National Center for Atmospheric Research. = Notable publications =  *  Awards and honors  * American Geophysical Union Global Environmental Change Early Career Award, 2019 * Ecological Society of America Early Career Fellow, 2019 * Science News 10 Scientists to Watch, 2019 * Jon C.

It was raised in Malta, then a British protectorate, with the intention of being sent in overseas expeditions. The unit was raised following the success of the Maltese Light Infantry at the Siege of Porto Ferrajo in 1801. The regiment was established on 7 December 1804, and it appeared on the Army List of 30 March 1805. The military unit was commanded by Major General William Villettes, who was also the overall commander of British troops in Malta and had the rank of Colonel of the regiment. It was led by British, Maltese and German officers, and it mainly consisted of men discharged from the Maltese Provincial Battalions along with around 100 Sicilians and some Spaniards. Due to the Royal Regiment having higher pay, many men resigned from the Provincials to join the new regiment, such that there was a shortage of men in the Provincials and the two-battalion military unit had to be reduced to a single battalion in 1806. The regiment included a total of 514 officers and men by mid-1805, and this increased to 758 in mid-1806. The Civil Commissioner of Malta, Captain Alexander Ball, was dissatisfied with the regiment's lack of discipline, and wanted the men to be sent abroad to Gibraltar or Sicily. The Royal Regiment of Malta reached its peak strength of 942 men in 1807, when it consisted of ten companies. It took part in surrounding Fort Ricasoli during the Froberg mutiny in April 1807. On 10 November 1807, about 950 men from the regiment joined the British forces in Sicily. The men embarked from Milazzo to reinforce the garrison of Capri in September 1808, occupying the town of Diamante on the way. The companies of the Royal Regiment of Malta were distributed between the main town of Capri and the rest of the island. Two weeks after the arrival of the regiment, on 4 October 1808, a French force of 6000 soldiers landed at Capri. The French attacked Anacapri on 15 October and most of the Maltese contingent was captured or killed in the process. Sources differ as to how many men were killed: from about 75 men to three quarters of the regiment. 120 others were wounded. Around 250 men surrendered after running out of gunpowder, and they were subsequently imprisoned in Naples and Castel Nuovo. About 270 men managed to avoid capture and returned to Malta in 1809.Villettes remained in command of the unit until 3 January 1808, when he left Malta for the Colony of Jamaica and was succeeded by Gen. John Murray By 1810, the remaining men of the Royal Regiment of Malta were garrisoned at Cottonera. In March 1811 they were sent to Gozo where they guarded French prisoners, while a detachment served on a gunboat in Sicily. The regiment was disbanded by Hildebrand Oakes at Fort Tign√© on 26 April 1811, and the men were encouraged to join other British military units serving in the Mediterranean, or the Maltese Provincial Battalion.

He was famous for the song \\"Grandma's Penghu Bay\\" (Â§ñÂ©ÜÁöÑÊæéÊπñÁÅ£), which is one of the classic Taiwanese campus folk songs in the late 1970s. He was also one of the first pop singers from Taiwan to perform in mainland China in the 1980s. After the successful nationwide television performance on CCTV New Year's Gala in 1989, he became well-known on both sides of the Strait. He died from kidney cancer in 2013. Life and career=Early life= Pan An-bang was born in a military dependents' village in Magong, Penghu in 1954. He was the first of four children in the family. His father came from mainland China to Penghu as a soldier of the Republic of China Armed Forces in the 1940s. During his childhood, he often helped his grandmother to cultivate mung bean sprouts and sell them at the market. =Music career=Taiwan and Southeast Asia ‚Äì 1977 to 1986 After he graduated from high school, he left Penghu and went to Taipei for university examination. In 1976, he was scouted by a television staff and offered a job as contract singer of Chinese Television System. In 1979, he helped Ye Jia-xiu, a folk song singer-songwriter, to promote songs on television program. Ye then wrote the song \\"Grandma's Penghu Bay\\", which later became Pan's signature song, for him. After the success of the debut album, the albums released in the following years, including \\"The Voices of Youth\\" (Âπ¥Ëºï‰∫∫ÁöÑÂøÉËÅ≤) and \\"Errant Love\\" (ËÅöÊï£ÂÖ©‰æù‰æù), made him popular in Taiwan and also in Singapore and Malaysia. \\"Father's Straw Sandal\\" (Áà∏Áà∏ÁöÑËçâÈûã), which was one track from the album \\"Errant Love\\", was banned by the government of Republic of China. The song was also written by Ye and inspired by Pan's father's real life as a soldier from mainland China. The song was more popular in Southeast Asia than in Taiwan and even spread to mainland China. In 1982, Pan was invited to perform in University of California, Los Angeles. He fell in love with a student of UCLA, who was a Taiwanese American. He married her in 1986 and then he also moved to the United States, where he started in clothing industry. Mainland China ‚Äì 1989 to 1993 Not long after the ban on family visits across the Strait was lifted in 1987, Pan was invited to perform on CCTV New Year's Gala in 1989. Despite Pan's father's job at the Office of President of the Republic of China, his father encouraged him. He performed three songs, including \\"Follow Your Feeling\\" (Ë∑üËëóÊÑüË¶∫Ëµ∞), \\"Grandma's Penghu Bay\\", and \\"Sun and Moon\\", on stage. He became very popular in mainland China after the nationwide broadcast of the show. However, later in the year, Pan had been forbidden to perform on stage for about one year since 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. He reduced music activity in Asia and lived with his family in the United States in the 1990s. Comeback ‚Äì 2001 to 2013 In 2001, Pan had an aortic dissection attack in Malaysia. Since then, he had been staying in Taiwan for 2 years for treatment, which made him decide to make a comeback on stage. In 2004, Pan released a new album \\"Good Times\\" (ÁæéÂ•ΩÊôÇÂÖâ). In 2007, he had a recurrent attack of aortic dissection in Singapore and survived after an emergent surgery. Despite suffering critical illness, he came back on stage quickly. He performed at a concert held by China Central Television in mainland China in 2007, and also performed at the evening party of National Day of the Republic of China in Penghu in 2010. In 2008, he started to host a talk show \\"Heartlight in the Human World\\" (‰∫∫ÈñìÂøÉÁáà) on Beautiful Life Television, a television station established by Fo Guang Shan, until 2012. =Death= In 2011, he was diagnosed with kidney cancer. In 2013, he died of sepsis related to chemotherapy at the age of 58. Grandma's Penghu Bay Pan An-Bang Museum ‚ÄúGrandma's Penghu Bay\\" is a track from Pan's debut album released in 1979. The song was written by Ye Jia-xiu and directly inspired by Pan's childhood life with his grandmother in Penghu, which is a group of islands in the Taiwan Strait. Since the song was widely spread, tourists have come to Penghu looking for \\"sunshine, beach, waves, cactuses, and the old skipper\\" depicted in the song. After Pan's death in 2013, the house where Pan spent his childhood was renamed \\"Pan An-Bang Museum\\" to pay tribute to Pan.

A Byzantine army of 7,500‚Äì9,000 and a fleet, both under the command of general Belisarius, laid siege to the city, which refused to surrender unlike all the other Ostrogothic-held cities in Sicily. Belisarius ordered his fleet to sail into the harbor and anchor beside the wall. Small boats filled with archers were hoisted on top of the ships' masts, which surpassed the height of the parapet. The fire from the archers convinced the Ostrogoths to surrender, completing the conquest of Sicily. Prelude Upon the beginning of the Gothic War (535‚Äì554), a Byzantine army of 7,500‚Äì9,000 men under Belisarius, supported by a fleet, landed in Sicily and took over Catania with little trouble. He made the city his headquarters and moved onto Syracuse, which also fell without a fight. Belisarius' army and fleet then advanced on Panormus. Siege The Ostrogoth garrison at Panormus was confident behind the protection of its walls and refused summons to surrender. Belisarius considered a land-based siege impossible and ordered his fleet to sail into the city harbor, which was right next to the walls but outside them and without Ostrogoth guards. The masts of the Byzantine ships were higher than the parapet and Belisarius ordered small boats filled with archers to be hoisted on top of the masts. The fire from above from the Byzantine archers threw the Ostrogothic garrison into panic and convinced them to surrender. Aftermath All of Sicily was now under Byzantine control. Belisarius made a triumphal entry to Syracuse on 31 December 535, the last day of his consulship.

However, she was able to pressure lawmakers to increase the size of a relief fund for tenants and landlords in the 2021 budget bill passed during the pandemic by 90%. She also led a successful effort to include a provision that would provide Medicaid benefits to undocumented seniors in the budget bill.

Prior to becoming a rebel, he was noted to have been a leader of the Chinese community in Demak on the island of Java.Raffles, Thomas Stamford (1830) [1817]. The History of Java. 2. London: Black. OCLC 312809187. pp. 235, 236, 242-244 =Java War= Rising tensions  During the formation (through conquest and colonization) of the Dutch East Indian colony of Batavia in the 17th century, Dutch authorities decided to invite artisans from China to Indonesia. Over the next century, Chinese communities were formed across the islands Sumatra and Java. The Chinese population of the colony grew increasingly wealthy, but by the early 18th-century resentment had started to grow between the Chinese and native people of Indonesia. This was most visible in Batavia, where in the 1730s the Dutch authorities began to pass laws restricting the rights of the Chinese. The Chinese population of Batavia began protesting these actions, resulting in a further crackdown by the Dutch.Setiono, Benny G. (2008).

Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde. 139 (2/3): 268‚Äì290 In 1740, the Dutch governor-general of Java, Adriaan Valckenier, ordered the deportation or killing of all Chinese (around 10,000 people) in Batavia. This order resulted in the 1740 Batavia massacre, during which thousands of Chinese were killed. However, a group of Chinese under the leadership of Khe Pandjang fled to Java, where they formed a rebel army to fight against Dutch authorities on the island.  War  As word of the massacre in Batavia spread, Chinese communities throughout Java began to mobilize for war. In central Java, leaders (including Singseh) from several Chinese settlements met in Demark to discuss plans for an expulsion of the Dutch from Java. It was agreed that the Chinese would form alliances with local rulers, and that a new, Javanese- Chinese kingdom would be formed. According to British historian Stamford Raffles, Singseh participated in this council and was to be crowned Emperor of Java once the Dutch had been defeated. The first year of the Java War went well for Singseh and the Chinese rebels, who were able to drive the Dutch and their allies out of Demark, Tegal, Semarang, and many parts of Central Java. However, by 1742 the tide of the war was turning against the rebels. In early 1742 Pakubuwono II, a Javanese king who had tentatively supported the Chinese, surrendered to the Dutch. Khe Pandjang and his army succeeded in seizing Pakubuwono's capital of Kartosuro, but the king's defection left Singseh and his army trapped in North-central Java. By June 1842, Singseh was in command of 4000 men in Demark; however, he was quickly surrounded by pro-Dutch Javanese forces, and in late July was defeated in battle. Singseh and his forces fled east, arriving in the rebel-controlled city of Surabaya, where they were besieged by a Dutch army. Following the defeat of Khe Pandjang's forces in Southern Java in December 1742, Singseh began negotiating with the Dutch. The Dutch offered amnesty for any Chinese involved in the rebellion, and thus Singseh and his army surrendered in February 1743; this surrender marked the end of the Java War. Singseh was taken into Dutch custody and exiled to Sri Lanka, where he later died.

She was the only child of General Jos√© Mar√≠a de la Cruz and his wife Josefa Za√±artu, and granddaughter of Chilean revolutionary Luis de la Cruz.  First Lady of Chile  De la Cruz became engaged to An√≠bal Pinto after he returned from a long trip in Europe, and they married on 24 November 1855 in Concepci√≥n. The marriage had political undertones; Pinto's father, Francisco Antonio Pinto, former President of Chile, felt that the marriage would help to heal the relationship between the cities of Concepci√≥n and Santiago. Animosity had arisen between the cities as a result of the 1851 Chilean Revolution, during which uprisings had taken place in Concepci√≥n against the central government based in Santiago. The marriage would create a familial link between de la Cruz's father, Jos√© Maria de la Cruz and Pinto's brother-in-law, Manuel Bulnes, who had fought against each other in the Battle of Loncomilla. Pinto was elected President of Chile in 1876, and de la Cruz accompanied him to all government ceremonies, even inspecting the troops in his company during the War of the Pacific. De la Cruz was related by marriage to two other First Ladies of Chile: Enriqueta Pinto, Pinto's sister and wife of Manuel Bulnes, and Luisa Garmendia, Pinto's mother and wife of Fransico Antonio Pinto. Musical Composition De la Cruz was an accomplished pianist and composer. Under the pseudonym Delfina Perez, de la Cruz published 12 works throughout the 19th century, surpassed in volume only by Isidora Zegers. Her work was praised by local press in Valpara√≠so and Santiago, where she sometimes performed benefit concerts. Several of her pieces also attained international recognition, including The Star of Night (), a polka for piano which was played in Paris, as well as Armando the Gondolier (), a waltz for piano later performed in Germany. She is also the first Chilean woman to venture into the composition of choral music, at the time a male-dominated sphere.

Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics Approximate location of Mesoproterozoic (older than 1.3 Ga) cratons in South America and Africa. The S√£o Lu√≠s and the Luis Alves cratonic fragments (Brazil) are shown, but the Arequipa‚ÄìAntofalla Craton and some minor African cratons are not. Other versions describe the Guiana Shield separated from the Amazonian Shield by a depression, and the Saharan Metacraton as a part of this West African Craton. Much of the rock underlying Brazil formed during the Precambrian, including the S√£o Francisco Craton which outcrops in Minas Gerais and Bahia. In the Mesoproterozoic, the Rio de la Plata Craton (beneath southern Brazil), the vast Amazonia Craton, and the small S√£o Luis Craton and sections of the Congo Craton which form the basement rock of much of Brazil were joined with Africa. Earlier, during the Archean, the S√£o Francisco Craton developed between 3.2 and 2.6 billion years ago and grew as microcontinents collided with it, forming a series of mobile belts. The rocks became a craton, a section of stable continental crust by the end of the Trans-amazonian orogeny 1.8 billion years ago. The Borborema Province is beneath areas in the northeast, with Paleoproterozoic craton basement rock originally assembled around even older Archean rocks. It includes three zones. The Zona Transveral is in the central sub-province between the Pernambuco Shear Zone and the S√£o Francisco Craton, displaying 2.2 billion year old gneiss, a suite of metavolcanic, metasedimentary and metaplutonic rocks as well as pluton formations from 640 to 540 million years ago. Uranium-lead dating has revealed two periods of acid magmatism in central Brazil, which produced the Goias tin province in granite and rhyolite. The Pernambuco Shear Zone, or lineament, is a steeply-dipping ductile shear zone formed 600 million years ago during the Brasiliano orogeny. The zone has two 100 meter wide mylonite zones surrounding it. The Brasiliano orogeny was a South American extension of the major Pan-African orogeny during a period when the two continents were joined. The proto-South Atlantic opened and then closed with subduction by around 750 million years ago in the Katangan episode. High potassium feldspar granites, gabbro and diorite emplaced following the Pan- African orogeny 600 million years ago in Goias, in central Brazil. In the northeast, the Brasiliano-Pan-African orogeny period led to reverse-type metamorphism, similar to what is now found in the Himalayas and thrust nappe formations 150 kilometers to the west. In the southeast of the country, the remnants of two mountain belts record the collision between three sections of continental crust: the Brasilia, S√£o Paulo and Vitoria plates. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Convergent plate tectonics within the continent of Gondwana had a major influence in the Paleozoic. The Maranhao inctracratonic basin in Piaui and Maranhao, close to the mouth of the Amazon spans 600,000 square kilometers and filled with 2.5 kilometers of sandstone and shale from the Cambrian through the Devonian. The sequence is capped with Mississippian, continental, marine and fluvial sandstones. With South America and Africa still conjoined, glaciers advanced across the region in the late Paleozoic. Glacial grooves and erosion marks scored the igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks in the Parana Basin. Diamictite and sandstone from this period are common in the southeast. The Early Permian Rio Bonito Formation in the Parana Basin contains fossil charcoal left by wildfires. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= Drilling in the Parana Basin and sampling of dikes around S√£o Paulo revealed that the Serra Geral basalts and Kaoko basalts in Namibia both formed at the same time‚Äî121 million years ago‚Äîmarking the beginning of the rifting open of the South Atlantic. Elsewhere, flood basalts and hypabyssal rocks from the Mesozoic mark the opening of the ocean in Maranha in the north. The Pernambuco Shear Zone in the northeast reactivated during the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea in the Cretaceous. In the late Cretaceous, kimberlite, carbonatite, olivine melilitite and tuffaceous diatreme intruded the Sao Francisco Craton.ikcabstracts.com/index.php/ikc/article/download/2448/2448 Magmatic activity also took place in the Borborema Province in the northeast through the Jurassic and Cretaceous. For almost 50 million years after the region rifted apart from Africa, relatively little material eroded. But analysis of offshore sediments indicates a rapid increase at the boundary with Paleogene. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= Continued crustal extension tied to the opening of the Atlantic continued into the Cenozoic. Shear and extension related fractures control water well productivity in S√£o Paulo. Along the coastline of Rio de Janeiro, an alkaline igneous complex intruded older Precambrian rocks with nepheline syenite, gabbro, shonkinite and clinopyroxenite. Alkali basalt erupted in Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte. Brittle deformation and dike swarms accompanied the formation of the Ponta Grossa Arch in the Parana Basin, within sandstone and siltstone of the Piramboia and Botucatu formations and the Serra Geral Formation tholeiitic basalt. In the northeast, the 130 kilometer long Pereiro Massif was uplifted. In the Paleogene, and in the early and late Miocene, sea levels dropped, recorded in sedimentary rocks in Para in the northeast. Simultaneously, turbidites flooded into the offshore Sao Tome deep sea basin. Within the Holocene, a short run climate change associated with the draining of a glacial lake is recorded in Brazilian stalagmites, indicating an intense South American summer monsoon. Natural resource geology Formed between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, Brazil has numerous offshore basins that contain oil, related to the rifting of the Atlantic Ocean. The Sergipe-Alagoas Basin is an example of Aptian age shale, conglomerate and sandstone deposited in the final phase of rifting, while the Miranga, Aracas, Dom Joao and Agua Grande fields reflect mid-Mesozoic lake-bed shales, with high oil-content Jurassic sandstones above them.

On 23 July, a Higher Forces Command Albania (Comando Superiore Truppe Albania) with a status of a field army was established as a higher instance, but on 1 December 1939 the two commands were merged as the Higher Forces Command Albania (XXVI Army Corps). On 24 October 1940, in preparation for the Italian invasion of Greece on the 28th, the Higher Forces Command Albania‚Äîwhich soon after became the 11th Army‚Äîwas divided into the XXVI Corps and the newly created XXV Corps Ciamuria. The corps occupied the eastern (right) half of the Italian front with Greece, between the Prespa Lakes and Mount Gobellit. It comprised the 49th Parma, 29th Piemonte, 19th Venezia, and 53rd Arezzo infantry divisions. The Corps' role during the early days of the Italian offensive was to mount diversionary attacks on the Greek front, but from 1 November the Greek troops of the Western Macedonia Army Section (TSDM) launched a counteroffensive, beginning an advance into Albania that was only halted at the Lake Ohrid‚ÄìTepeleni line. The front remained relatively stable thereafter, despite the attempt of the Italian Spring Offensive in March 1941 to achieve a breakthrough. Following the German invasion of Greece on 6 April, on 10 April the Italian forces in the Albanian front began their own advance against the retreating Greeks, arriving at the old Greco-Albanian border on 23 April, the day of the capitulation of the Greek army to the Germans. On 4 May, the corps was redesignated as the Alpine Army Corps Command (XXVI) (Comando Corpo d'Armata Alpino (XXVI)) with the 2nd Tridentina and 5th Pusteria alpine divisions, until its dissolution on 15 June. XXVI Corps was reconstituted on 1 August 1941, inheriting the units of the disbanded XXV Corps, the divisions Acqui, Modena, Julia, and Pusteria. Based at Ioannina, it assumed occupation duties in western Greece (Epirus and the Ionian Islands), in a coastal defence and anti-partisan role. In 1942, Julia was repatriated, but in spring 1943, it received operational control over the 1st German Mountain Division. The corps remained in place until the Italian armistice of September 1943, when it was disbanded.

She served as a member of the German parliament (\\"Bundestag\\") between 1994 and 2002. Between 2002 and 2009 she was one of Berlin's more high-profile senators. Life=Provenance and early years= Heidi Knake was born in Tomaschow (as it was known at that time), a midsized industrial town to the south-west of Warsaw which had been in Congress Poland before the First World War, in Poland subsequently, and since 1939 part of Nazi Germany. However, by the time she was 2 extensive ethnic cleansing in what had again become Poland in 1945 had already removed most of the German-speaking population, and she grew up in Wilhelmshaven on Germany's north-western coast. Knake passed her Abitur (school final exams) in 1964 which opened the way to university-level education. She then progressed to the University of G√∂ttingen, emerging in 1969 with a degree in Social Economics. There followed a period of post- graduate research and study at Oldenburg. It was from the university at Oldenburg that in 1978 she received her doctorate in Social Sciences, and where till 1987 she stayed on as a researcher into topics such as family, education and industrial sociology. That year she switched to the University of Bremen. =Communist= Heike Knake became a DGB (trades union) member in 1969, and has been a member of a succession of unions subsequently. She joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD) in 1970, and became increasingly engaged politically, both within the party and in local politics more generally, serving for four years as a municipal councillor in Oldenburg. For some of this time she was the deputy leader of the SPD group on the council. However, at the height of the ructions over professional blocks for members of extremist political parties, in 1981 she resigned from the SPD and joined the German Communist Party. This came directly after the increasingly \\"moderate\\" SPD party executive had launched its own \\"party operation\\" (\\"Parteiordnungsverfahren\\") against the \\"renitente Linke\\" (loosely \\"reluctant left\\"). She remained a Communist Party member till 1989. The German Communist Party never gained electoral traction with West German voters, partly because of a widespread belief that across the \\"inner border\\" in East Germany the supposedly pro-communist ruling party was principally a tool of Soviet imperial expansionist ambitions. Sources are almost entirely silent about Heidi Knake-Werner's nine years as a member of the German Communist Party. In 1990 she changed her political allegiance again, joining the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), recently relaunched as a successor to the old East German Socialist Unity Party, as younger members of what had till recently been East Germany's ruling political establishment struggled to prepare for a democratic future, following the changes of 1989/90. Reunification took place suddenly, formally, in October 1990, and during the rest of that year it was still unusual for a western politician to join the PDS: most of the relatively small number who did so came not from the West German Communist Party but from the SPD. Her own transition gave Knake- Werner a reputation as a political maverick which she has subsequently seemed to relish. =Party of Democratic Socialism= At the second party conference of the PDS, held in Berlin on 26/27 January 1991, she was elected a member of the party executive, and was also one of just four PDS members from former West Germany to be voted onto the party presidium. Later that year she accepted an offer from the youthful PDS Bundestag member, Petra Bl√§ss to work as a parliamentary researcher for the PDS group in the Bundestag. For Heidi Knake-Werner it was the start of a Bundestag career that would last for more than a decade. In 1994 Knake-Werner herself was elected to the Bundestag. She stood as a list-candidate from the \\"Aschersleben‚ÄìBernburg‚ÄìQuedlinburg\\" electoral district where the party failed to clear the 5% hurdle necessary to send members to the Bundestag. However, in the recently re-established state of Saxony-Anhalt, the PDS received 18% of the total vote and was thereby entitled to nominate 4 additional members: Heidi Knake-Werner was one of those nominated. =Bundestag= During the 1994-1998 parliamentary session Knake- Werner was a deputy chairperson of the PDS parliamentary group, under the leadership of Gregor Gysi. In the Bundestag she took on responsibility for her party's \\"Labour market and social policy\\" portfolio. She also represented the PDS position to the parliamentary committee for \\"Labour and Social Affairs\\" and on the parliamentary \\"Health committee\\". That reflected several of the areas on which she had already focused while working before 1994 as a parliamentary researcher for Petra Bl√§ss. Other themes in which she took a particular interest included pensions policy, family matters and gender equality, both in the workplace and more widely. She also engaged with more overtly feminist agenda issues such as the ongoing debates about abortion legislation, an issue on respect of which the country had inherited more conventionally \\"liberal\\" laws from communist East Germany than from capitalist West Germany. The carefully detailed nature of her numerous annotation included in party archives make it clear that she contributed extensively to the content and coherence of the party's position papers on many of these topics. During the 1994-1998 Bundestag session Heidi Knake-Werner was the author or co-author of 3 draft laws, 18 parliamentary motions, 3 motions for resolution, and 30 amendments as well as of 4 major question applications and 67 minor question applications. She delivered 56 speeches in plenary parliamentary sessions and issued 135 press statements. She was also a member of the PDS parliamentary delegation that took part in the Fourth International United Nations Women's Forum held in Beijing during the first part of September 1995. In the 1998 General election Knake-Werner was re-elected. The PDS increased its share of the national vote from 4.4% to 5.1%. Breaking through to 5% hurdle significantly increased the party's strength in the Bundestag, notably in respect of appointments to parliamentary committees. In addition, for the first time the PDS was able to nominate a member to the Bundestag presidium. During the parliamentary session, till 2002, Knake-Werner served as a member of the executive of the PDS parliamentary group, and till October 2000 she was also deputy leader of the PDS Bundstag group. Then, as part of a general shake-up at the top of the parliamentary party that accompanied the unexpected resignation from the leadership of Gregor Gysi, in October 2000 she was, some felt, demoted when she became the parliamentary group's \\"First Parliamentary Business Leader\\" (\\"Erste Parlamentarische Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrerin\\"), remaining in post till January 2002. The PDS group were now able to send her as a full member to the Bundestag committee for \\"Labour and Social Affairs\\", of which till October 2000 she served as a deputy chairwoman. In respect of the deputy chairmanship role she was replaced when she became \\"First Parliamentary Business Leader\\" of the PDS, but she continued to play her part as the PDS member of the committee. Separately, by 2002 she was serving as honorary chairwomen of the German-Portuguese parliamentary group. On 17 February 2002 Heidi Knake-Werner resigned from the Bundestag in order to take up new duties as a Berlin senator. Her successor in the Bundestag was Wolfgang Bierstedt. =Berlin senate= Between 17 January 2002 and November 2006 Heid Knake-Werner served as the Berlin senator for Health, Social affairs and Consumer protection. She switched portfolios on 23 November 2006, becoming the senator for Integration, Labour and Social affairs. In the Berlin election of September 2006 she was elected a member of the City Parliament (\\"Abgeordnetenhaus\\"), but half a year later she withdrew from the chamber in order to be able to focus on her ministerial duties. Then, on 15 October 2009, she resigned her office on grounds of age. =Later years= In October 2010 she was elected to chair the Berlin region Volkssolidarit√§t (\\"People's Solidarity\\"), a welfare organisation for the over 65s which traces its origins back to East Berlin and the old German Democratic Republic, but which survived the traumas of reunification better than most of the state mandated East German institutions. In 2014 a further election confirmed her in office. By that time it was reported that the Berlin Volkssolidarit√§t was operating around 70 day centers, retirement homes and other facilities in Berlin.

History The XXV Corps was first established in Mortegliano on 10 April 1917, until its disbandment on 5 January 1919. On 24 October 1940, in preparation for the Italian invasion of Greece on the 28th, the Ciamuria Army Corps was activated in Italian-occupied Albania, with the 23rd Ferrara and 51st Siena infantry divisions and the Centauro Armoured Division. It was assigned the western (right) half of the Italian front, and on the start of the war advanced into Greek territory until it was stopped in the Battle of Elaia‚ÄìKalamas. Following the start of the Greek counteroffensive on the Italian left, covered by XXVI Army Corps, it was forced to retreat. On 17 November 1940 it was redesignated as XXV Army Corps. On 7 December it abandoned Argyrokastro, on 18 December Porto Palermo, and on 20 Himara. To shorten its front, the corps was assigned in mid-December to the sector around Mount Tomorr and the That e Progonat lines, where the Greek offensive was stopped. On 20 January 1941 it launched spoiling attacks in the Ao√∂s sector to relieve pressure on the Italian left, which was facing the final, unsuccessful Greek push towards Berat. In February, the corps was deployed from Shendeli to Kurvelesh, and opposed the Greek attacks in the Mount Trebeshin√´‚ÄìMount Sh√´ndelli area. On 8 March the corps was placed in defence of Tepeleni, while on the next day it took part in the unsuccessful Italian Spring Offensive (9‚Äì18 March).

It was built in the late 14th century, in the Genoan period, shortly before the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans. Located in Galata (Karak√∂y), it is the city's only church built in the traditional style of the Armenian church architecture‚Äînamely with a dome with a conical roof. History=Foundation= It is the oldest of Istanbul's Armenian churches (total around 35). According to a manuscript formerly kept at the Armash monastery the church was founded in 1391 by an Armenian merchant named Kozma () from Kaffa (now Feodosia) in Crimea who bought the land on which it was built. Galata at the time was a Genoese colony and the Armenians found more protection under their control rather than that of the Byzantine Empire. The blacksmith Aved built the altar of the church as well as the Holy Cross chapel near the church. First concrete evidence of the existence of the church comes from two 1431 inscriptions on the church. The date is sometimes cited as the foundation date of the church. Historian Kevork Pamukciyan believes that the current church was built on the location of St. Sargis, an Armenian church in Galata, mentioned in two Armenian manuscripts from 1360 and 1361. Side view View from above =Later history= The church and an Armenian quarter around it are recorded in an Ottoman survey from 1455 which indicated the \\"continuation of the Byzantine Armenian presence into the Ottoman period.\\" In 1635 Patriarch Grigor Kesaratsi (Gregory of Caesarea) was buried at the wall of the church by Shahin √áelebi, a wealthy Armenian. The church was often damaged by fires. It survived the Galata fire of 1660. It burned almost entirely in 1731 and was restored in 1733 by Sargis Khalfa, during the tenure of the Patriarch Hovhannes Golod. The church was again burned almost completely in 1771. It was restored 28 years later, in 1799 by the architect Minas Khalfa who added the chapel of Surb Karapet (\\"Holy Precursor\\", i.e. John the Baptist). In 1888 the church and the two chapels joined and turned into one when the interior walls were taken down. The crypt of Hovhannes Golod (d. 1741), located under the church, is decorated with black-and-white K√ºtahya and Dutch tiles. The original church, richly decorated with tiles, included French, Italian, Chinese porcelain, and Tunisian tiles. They were probably added during an 18th century restoration. The church was visited and described by European visitors such as Antoine Galland (1672), Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (early 1700s), and William Holden Hutton (). The latter wrote that it \\"contains some fine [manuscripts] and a sacred picture of Christ, of great antiquity.\\" In 1879 Malachia Ormanian, the future Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople and a historian, served as a priest at the church early in his life. =Demolition and reconstruction= The church was expropriated by the state and demolished in May 1958 to widen the street as part of large-scale reconstruction in Istanbul in the Adnan Menderes period. In 1962 architect Bedros Zobyan designed a reconstruction plan for the church. It was completed in four years due to financial difficulties. The church was reconsecrated in 1965, but the official opening ceremony took place on May 15, 1966 and was presided over by Patriarch ≈ûnork Kalustyan. The new church is almost half as wide as the original, measuring . Due to the limited space allocated for the church, a basement was built to house the chapel and the grave of Hovhannes Golod (below the bell tower) and a balcony for the choir. The church underwent renovations in 2005 and 2011. Getronagan School The Getronagan Armenian High School was established in 1886 next to the church.

While he began his career as a Catholic priest, Saurin ultimately converted and became a pastor of the Reformed Church of France.  Early life and education  Jacques Saurin was born in N√Æmes, France on January 6, 1677. He was the oldest child of Jean Saurin (1632-1705), a lawyer and the secretary of the Academy of N√Æmes, and Hippolyte de Tourni√®re. Jacques Saurin had three younger siblings: Louis, Marc-Antoine, and Anne-Marie. Saurin and his siblings were raised as huguenots. In 1685, when the Edict of Nantes was revoked by Louis XIV, Saurin and his family were forced to flee from France. The family ultimately settled in Geneva, Switzerland. There, Saurin studied theology and philosophy. Saurin's studies were briefly interrupted in 1694, when he decided to volunteer to serve in the army of Victor Amadeaus II of Sardinia during the Nine Years' War against Louis XIV. He remained in the army until the Treaty of Ryswick was signed in 1697. He then returned to his studies in Geneva where he was taught by Louis Tronchin, B√©n√©dict Pictet, and Jean-Alphonse Turretin. He completed his studies on July 5, 1700.  Career  While Saurin lived in Geneva, he embraced Catholicism and decided to become a Catholic priest after completing his studies. Specifically, he found success preaching in Montpellier. In 1700, Saurin moved briefly to Holland before settling in London, England. There, in 1701 he was appointed to serve as a pastor for a Walloon church. He also served as a chaplain for a regiment of soldiers stationed in England. London's weather unfortunately did not agree with Saurin's health, and after only four years, he decided to leave England. In 1705, he settled in The Hague. Here, he underwent a religious conversion experience and became a pastor of the Reformed Church of France.  Personal life  In 1703, Saurin married Catherine Boitoult. Together, they had five children between 1707 and 1724: Philippe, Antoine, Jeanne-Isabelle, Jacques-Antoine et Guillaume- Sicco.

Biography Son of Otto Luedeke, an officer in the US Army and a competitor in the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games, Raymond Luedeke had a peripatetic childhood. Between the ages of 5 and 8, he lived in Japan. He alludes that his first concert of classical music was heard in Tokyo and that the music was Japanese classical music. He began piano lessons in Japan but did not continue this until the family was living in Massachusetts, where he took up the clarinet at the age of nine. He was soon composing his first pieces, something he continued when the family moved to New Jersey. In 1966 Luedeke received his bachelor's degree from the Eastman School of Music, majoring in Music History. The following year he attended theUniversity of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, on a Fulbright Grant, studying composition and clarinet.

He would later receive numerous grants from Canadian Arts Coumcils, (Canada Council for the Arts, Laidlaw Foundation, Ontario Arts Council, Toronto Arts Council) The Music The music of Ray Luedeke, along with traditional elements, incorporates a variety of the techniques of 20th and 21st Century music, including metric modulation, extended or ambiguous tonality, spatial notation, and the harmonic use of pitch sets. A good deal of his music is inspired by poetry, particularly that of Pablo Neruda and of William Carlos Williams. Some of his music includes references to the music of non-Western cultures, to Japanese classical music, to African drumming, and to the Indonesian gamelan. In Kevin Vigil's doctoral thesis on the guitar music of Raymond Luedeke, the composer is asked if he has had style periods, given the variety of forms found in his music: He replies that his style is to be found in his musical line and in his personal concept of counterpoint, rather than in his musical vocabulary, which may vary. He compares his music to poetry, in which metaphors may be interpreted in various ways. He does not accept the concept of absolute music, of music that only refers to itself. Without being programmatic, his music has a narrative that can suggest a variety of interpretations.

She is the spokesperson for the presidential office in Taiwan. She has worked as a reporter for Formosa Television and a news anchor for the Taiwan Indigenous Television. She was the director for the Aboriginal People's Administration of the Taoyuan City Government. In 2016, she was elected as a non-divisional legislator and an aboriginal affairs representative of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). In 2017, she was elected as a visiting scholar of the US Department of State's International Leadership Program. In July 2018, she joined the cabinet and became a spokesperson for the Executive Yuan. She is the first Taiwanese aboriginal to hold the position.  Name  The Pangcah people (aka Amis people) pass their name in a connected system. Kolas' grandfather received the Japanese name Yoshinari during Japanese rule, so her father followed the tribal system with the name Yoshinari Yutaka (ÂêâÊàêË±ê). The family was assigned the Yo sound as the Chinese surname Yeh (Ëëâ) by the KMT government after Japanese rule ended. Kolas followed the system by using her father's name as her own, and thus got the name Kolas Yotaka. She changed her Chinese name on her household registration to her indigenous name around 2005-2006, after new legislation made it possible for indigenous people use their indigenous name legally. She uses the romanized Kolas Yotaka rather than the Chinese phonetic translation ().  Early life  She was born in Hsinchu City and belongs to the Amis Harawan tribe of Yuli, Hualien. She obtained her bachelor's and master's degree in sociology from Tunghai University in 1996 and 1999 respectively.  Journalism career  After completing her studies, she worked as a program producer and reporter on PTS and FTV. She also worked at weekly business magazine, Harvard Business Review and other magazines, as well as CNN Interactive English. She translated the book Routes: Travel and Translation the Late in Twentieth Century by anthropologist and historian James Clifford to Chinese. From 2005 to 2013, she served as the assistant, producer and anchor at Taiwan Indigenous Television. She also served as the interview leader and the anchor for the English news. She was responsible for logistics, special planning, documentary filming and international news interviews. In 2007, while she was a producer and anchor of \\"Indigenous Peoples Evening News,\\" the show received an Excellence in Journalism award. It was also nominated for the award in 2008 and 2011. In 2014, she began producing and hosting the weekly international news program \\"Mata! See the World\\". She also produced 14 documentaries on indigenous activism. This series is called \\"Indigenous Movements\\". Several of her documentaries were nominated for and received a range of awards. \\"Wounds of Sami\\" was nominated for the 2012 Award for Excellence in Journalism, \\"The Death of Wufeng\\" won the silver at the 2013 Nepal International Aboriginal Film Festival, and \\"Fight for the Island-Punsu No Tao\\" was nominated for the 2014 International Uranium Film Festival in Rio.  Political career  Kolas served as the director of the Aboriginal National Administrative Bureau of the Taoyuan City Government, the Ninth Legislative Yuan (representing the Democratic Progressive Party), and spokesperson for the Executive Yuan. = Aboriginal National Administrative Bureau of the Taoyuan City Government = At the end of 2014, Cheng Wen-tsan, then mayor of Taoyuan City, appointed her as the first female director of the Aboriginal Administration of the Taoyuan City Government; and revised the name of the institution which has been used for 14 years to ‚ÄúIndigenous Peoples Administration Bureau‚Äù. It took effect on March 11, 2015 and required the name card to be include aboriginal scripts. = Legislative Yuan = In the 2016 general election, Kolas was elected as a legislator under the DPP. The Citizens Congress Watch rated her as an outstanding legislator in the Third Session. Sometimes she write her legislative reports in Amis language. On the eve of International Mother Language Day in 2016, Kolas promoted ‚Äúmother language justice‚Äù, and proposed amendments to the ‚ÄúNames Regulations‚Äù and ‚ÄúPublic Officials' Choice of Law‚Äù. It suggested that the name of the National Identity Card of the Republic of China can be used without Chinese characters, so other writing systems (such as tribal language orthography) can to used to register the name. It is possible to include both aboriginal languages and Chinese documents together on the election gazette. In mid-December of the same year, the draft Act on the Development of the Languages of Indigenous Peoples was proposed. In May 2016, Kolas, Chen Chi-mai, and 17 other legislators proposed a bill to abolish the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. On 20 May 2016, 18 legislators including Kolas and Chen Qimai proposed the Draft Amendment to Article 16 of the Immigration and Immigration Law, which was passed on November 1, 2016. On 5 September 2016, Kolas visited the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India. She was the first Taiwanese aboriginal legislator to meet with the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama was very interested in the Amis sash on Kolas. He said that President Tsai Ing-wen's apology to the aborigines was \\"very good, it is a trend\\". On the following day, the Human Rights Network for Tibet and Taiwan held their first press conference in Dharamsala. On 15 February 2017, Kolas accompanied a Taiwanese-Tibetan family to the Executive Yuan to submit a request; on the 20th of the same month, the Ministry of the Interior's Immigration Department abolished the principle of \\"collective review of the application for residence of Tibetan spouses holding Indian travel permits\\" and established ‚Äúfollowing the Nationality and Immigration Act, Article 16, Item 4, Tibetan residents who have changed their nationality and hold Indian travel permit can apply for stay in Taiwan‚Äù. On 23 April 2017, the Ministry of the Interior, at the request of the Kolas, canceled the ceremony of the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, and the Central Government would no longer sent representatives of the Ministry to attend the Zheng Chenggong Festival, breaking the 54-year political convention and reflecting Taiwan's change in attitude to identity and multiculturalism. On 17 June 2018, Kolas was invited by the Hawaiki Project (an Indigenous social initiative) to seek funding from the Council of Indigenous Peoples to allow New Zealand MƒÅori children to come to Taiwan on 23 August 2018 for a 10-day origin trip and participate in traditional tribal ceremonies; and at the same time plan in mid-February 2019, allow Taiwanese aboriginal children go to New Zealand to experience Maori culture. = Executive Yuan spokesperson = Because of her August 2014 drunk driving record, she has expressed her willingness to serve as an anti-drunk driving volunteer for life. KMT members of the Legislative Yuan argued with the social consensus of the \\"zero tolerance\\" policy for Kolas to be dismissed. Ho Hsin- chun, the head of the Democratic Progressive Party Committee, believes that a person who admits their mistake should be given the opportunity. On 15 August 2018, when President Tsai Ing-wen passed through Los Angeles, she visited the local 85¬∞C store. Therefore, 85 ¬∞C was bombarded by Chinese netizens as a ‚ÄúTaiwan independence enterprise‚Äù. 85 ¬∞C immediately issued a statement that they ‚ÄúSupport the 1992 Consensus‚Äù. Kolas Yotaka said she \\"sympathize 85 ¬∞C very much\\" and also strongly condemns the use of self-righteous ideology in specific countries to suppress free markets and international companies. On 22 August 2018, the NgƒÅti Manu tribe of the Maori in New Zealand came to Taiwan for a cultural trace. After arriving in Taiwan, the traditional leader (rangatira) Arapeta Hamilton led the team to the Executive Yuan to thank spokesperson Kolas Yotaka, expressing their excitement in finding a link between Maori culture and Taiwanese aboriginal culture. On 20 September 2018, at the invitation of Queen Bilung Gloria Salii of the Republic of Palau, she participated in the \\"25th Anniversary Conference of the National Women's Conference\\" as the guest speaker. She was the first representative of the Taiwanese government to ever attend the conference.  Controversies  In March 2018, lawyer Jewel Chen implied online that Kolas was cohabiting with politician Icyang Parod, so Kolas sued her for defamation. On October 3, 2018, the Taiwan Taipei District Prosecutors Office pointed out that since representation of the electorate is elected by the public, the handling of public affairs, whether private or honest, will affect the purity and credit of the public office, so it must be criticized by the outside world. Even if there is a need for private inspection, it should be publicly available. In this matter, since it was implied, the lawsuit was dropped. On 6 October 2018, Kolas requested assistance from the Legal Aid Foundation with lawsuit. This action was subsequently criticized as a misuse of Legal Aid resources.  Personal life  In 2007, she was in a relationship with politician Icyang Parod.

In September 2017, Paste Magazine broke the news that Lynn and Mohr had completed the record, titled My Movie Star, which was co-Produced by the two, and that Lynn would be working with T-Pain muse GLASYS in the studio. It was also announced that the album would feature collaborations between Logan Lynn and 80s pop star Tiffany, The Dandy Warhols, Jarryd James, DoublePlusGood, Stose, Rian Lewis and others. On July 12, 2018 Billboard magazine included the pre-order for \\"My Movie Star\\" in an exclusive feature story about Logan Lynn going on tour to promote mental health advocacy. On October 12, 2018 Logan Lynn's 9th studio album was released. In a review of the record, Billboard said \\"For nearly 20 years, dance-pop artist Logan Lynn has made a career out of crafting catchy, disorderly songs that almost all include big beats, fun melodies and cheeky lyrics. But on his latest album, My Movie Star, Lynn has traded in his signature sound for a more somber, melancholy tone ‚Äî a dynamic new album consisting of Lynn's new piano-driven songs and filled with remixes and covers by other industry greats.\\" Music videos In February 2018, Logan Lynn and Jay Mohr released the \\"My Movie Star\\" featurette, which made its exclusive premiere on BuzzBands LA. The short film featured three previously unreleased songs from the album. Lynn credits Jay Mohr with inspiring the album, on which Mohr is a producer and co-writer. On August 2, 2018 Earbuddy hosted the exclusive premiere of Logan Lynn and Rian Lewis' \\"Underground\\" music video. The short film was produced by Lynn and Jay Mohr and is a stop-motion animation piece created by LAIKA Studios-trained animator Adam Taylor. Logan Lynn and Jay Mohr released two versions of the music video for \\"Nothing's Ever Wrong\\" on September 10, 2018 via Self-Titled Magazine. Starring Mohr, the video was written and directed by Lynn himself. The NC-17 Director's Cut featured full frontal nudity. The R-rated version featured backside nudity only. This is the first time Mohr had appeared fully nude in a film. In an interview with Self-Titled that ran alongside the premiere, Jay is quoted as saying \\"Logan Lynn is a loving artist. He knows he has doors to open that we can't close, so in 'Nothing's Ever Wrong' he leaves out everything but what's there. The big change to the minor chords when he sings 'cause it's not my life'.... It shook me. I mean driving-and-crying shook me. It's so beautiful. Indescribably beautiful, but it's ominous for me... foreboding. Like if he goes any further it will break your heart; a door that can never be closed if he opens it.\\" The day the album was released, Logan Lynn also released the music video for \\"This Time I Lost It All\\", which he directed himself. On October 31, Lynn released the \\"Beside You\\" music video, also self-directed, in which he shaves his beard on camera.

Traditionalist Muslims refer to themselves as ahlusunnah wal jamaah or aswaja.Bush, 2009. Traditionalism is often contrasted with modernism, which is inspired by modernity and rationalism. Traditionalism has been the most adhered Muslim religious orientation in the history of contemporary Muslim Indonesia. The extent of traditionalism widely overlaps with the influence of a socio- religious organization Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Muslim organization in Indonesia. Traditionalism is also a critical element within the Muslim intellectual movement known as Islam Nusantara. Usage of the term The division between \\"traditionalism\\" and \\"modernism\\" is widely used by both Indonesians and foreign academics to describe the chasm which has been existed among the contemporary Muslim society in Indonesia. Previously, Muslim society in Java in particular was analyzed through the division of abangan, santri and priyayi popularized by an anthropologist Clifford Geertz based on communal identity. However, this division has already been considered obsolete.Von Der Mehden, 1995. Greg Barton of Monash University states that since the 1950s and 1960s, Indonesian society could be reasonably described based on the traditionalist-modernist dualism.Barton, 1994. Definition Traditionalism is broadly defined by adherence toward four maddhabs (Islamic schools of jurisprudence) within the fiqh scholarship, especially the Shafi'i maddhab, and education based on pesantren, an Islamic boarding school system indigenous to the Indonesian archipelago.Feener, 2007. Traditionalism highly regards the position and guidance of ulamas (Muslim intellectual on religious issues) from the classical era, and local or communal kyais (an indigenous title for religious leaders). Traditionalists are also commonly understood as Muslims who are more accepting toward pluralism and interfaith tolerance. This understanding and the term itself, however, can be problematic as it doesn't always reflect the complex and diverse reality on the ground. Some other terms are often used in a similar context, notably \\"substantialist\\", \\"orthodox\\", or \\"moderate\\". History Islam in Indonesia was initially spread through merchant activity by Arab traders as well as proselytization by Sufi saints. These Sufi missionaries, along with Shafi'i maddhab they brought in, could flexibly accommodate local practices and traditions. Local beliefs or practices of Hindu or animist origins were incorporated and became part of the traditions such as saint veneration known as Ziyarat, honorific title of kyai, or pesantren as an educational institution. Ulama and kyais, mostly wealthy landowners of rural area, were authoritative figures in this system, and santri (students) learned Islam through taqlid (rote learning) and kitab kuning. Distinct characteristics of traditionalism are based on such syncretism and rural communal dynamics. From the late 19th to early 20th century, increasing numbers of Muslims have studied in the Middle East, where reformist thoughts such as Islamic modernism and Wahhabism were taking hold. These Muslims with reformist mindset, mostly highly educated urban dwellers, established the modernist organization Muhammadiyah in 1912, and advocated for purification of such traditions based on puritanical teachings derived from the Qur'an and Hadith alone. Local ulamas and kyais, threatened by such movements, have established Nahdlatul Ulama in East Java as a response (1929). Other notable traditionalist organizations included the Islamic Education Association (Perti) in West Sumatra (1930), and Nahdlatul Wathan in Lombok (1952). NotesFootnotesReferences *Barton, G.

She studied engineering at the University of Toronto where she completed her Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Her PhD on the influence of fluoride on bone quality was supervised by Marc Grynpas in the Department of Materials at Toronto. She studied Colletes bees, which create a cellophane-like substance to wrap their eggs in tunnels. The bees first create fibres of silk, followed by layers of plastics. Career and research After her PhD, Chachra joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a postdoctoral researcher. She worked in Lorna Gibson's lab on how bone responds to ageing. She looked at the shelf-life of bioprosthetic heart valves. Chachra has contributed to The Atlantic and the comic Bitch Planet. She is a trustee of the Awesome Foundation. Her newsletter Metafoundry was described by Wired magazine as being 'like being plugged Oculus-style into her brain while she meditates on science and culture'. She appeared on the PBS show If You Build It. She joined Olin College after her postdoc, working on fluoride and mineralised tissues. She was one of their founding faculty - the first class graduated in 2006. = Engineering education research = Prof Chachra's students at Olin College Chachra studies the experience of student engineers. She does not like to be referred to as a \\"maker\\" because she believes the world is associated with a male dominated culture. She is part of Olin College's Collaboratory.
