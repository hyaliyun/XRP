The law gives anyone suffering a terminal illness, with less than six months to live, the right to end their life. The law had an 18-month implementation period, and came into effect on 19 June 2019. The Bill On 20 September 2017, the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill 2017 was introduced into the Legislative Assembly of the Victorian Parliament by the Andrews Labor Government. The bill is modelled on the recommendations of an expert panel chaired by former Australian Medical Association president Professor Brian Owler. The proposed legislation was said by proponents to be the most conservative in the world; it contains 68 safeguards including measures designed to protect vulnerable people from coercion and abuse, as well as a Review Board to promote compliance. Labor and Coalition MPs were allowed a conscience vote on the Bill. The bill was debated in the lower house over three sitting days, passing the assembly without amendment on 20 October 2017 after an emotional and tense debate which lasted more than 24 hours. The bill was passed by 47 votes to 37. The bill moved to the Legislative Council for debate. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating spoke out against the passing of the bill to the upper house saying \\"the passage of the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill through the Victorian lower house is truly a sad moment for the whole country.\\" The Prime Minister at the time, Malcolm Turnbull, who is also against euthanasia, said: > It is the Victorian parliament's job to do this, I'm not a supporter of > euthanasia but I have been following the debate and it would be very > interesting to see if their upper house passes it and what follows on from > it. ... Federal law prevails over a state law but only in an area that both > the Commonwealth and the state parliament have jurisdiction, so you've got > to begin with an area where the federal parliament has jurisdiction. On 14 November 2017, the government agreed to a series of amendments designed to garner further support for the bill in the Council. For terminally ill adults in severe pain and with only 12 months to live, the deadline to access lethal drugs was cut to six months, except for sufferers of neurodegenerative conditions such as motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, an amendment restricting this scheme to people who have lived in Victoria for 12 months was accepted, as was a requirement for a death to be documented as assisted dying, in addition to noting the underlying disease. Funding for palliative care in regional areas was also increased as part of the agreement. On 22 November 2017, the bill in its amended form passed the Council by 22 votes to 18, after a marathon sitting lasting more than 28 hours. The bill returned to the Legislative Assembly for consideration of the Council's amendments. The Assembly approved of the Council's amendments on 29 November 2017. In passing the legislation, Victoria became the first state to legalise assisted suicide. The law received royal assent on 5 December 2017, and came into effect on 19 June 2019. The 18-month period allowed for implementation of the scheme including establishment of a review board. Reactions Kathy Eagar, the executive director of the Australian Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration, and director of the Australian Health Services Research Institute at the University of Wollongong, has analysed the statistics surrounding euthanasia internationally, and says the law is limited. According to Eagar, the most important reason people choose euthanasia is that they don't want to lose their independence and autonomy. She believes euthanasia is a social issue and not a health issue, and maintains that less than one in five people choose euthanasia due to pain. Lorraine Baker, the Victorian President of the Australian Medical Association, said that the passing of the legislation marked a \\"significant shift\\" in medical practice in Victoria, but the conscientious objection provisions contained in the legislation would ensure that doctors would not be forced into taking part in voluntary assisted dying. Euthanasia advocate Philip Nitschke called the law \\"beg and grovel legislation\\" because people will only be able to access it as a privilege granted in extremis rather than as a right to be accessed at a time nominated by the patient. First use Kerry Robertson was the first person to be granted a permit under the Voluntary Assisted Dying Act. Robertson was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and was declared cancer free after surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Four years later she developed a tumour in her in bones, that spread to her lungs and brain. When the cancer spread to her liver Robertson ceased treatment. Her palliative care team was unable to ease the pain. Robertson applied for the permit on the first day the act came into force, 19 June 2019, citing \\"loss of joy\\" as her reason. Robertson ended her life on 15 July 2019 at the age of 61 with her two daughters, and best friend by her side.

In April 2000, Carter's first book, No Excuses: Lessons from 21 High-Performing, High- Poverty Schools, was published by the Heritage Foundation. A review by Richard Rothstein in the New York Times challenged the book's value, citing \\"contempt for most public education\\", prompting a response from Carter published in the paper on the same day as Rothstein's subsequent column. In 2008, Washington Post education columnist Jay Mathews ran a contest to label highly-successful schools serving low-income neighborhoods. A majority of respondents endorsed Carter's \\"No Excuses Schools\\". In 2003, Carter joined the Advisory Board Company. There, he worked as a director of research in their management consulting and leadership development divisions, H*Works and The Academies. From 2005 to 2007, Carter was president of National Heritage Academies, where he oversaw corporate strategy and the implementation of educational operations with a focus on turning around low-performing schools.

It was released through Avex Trax on September 4, 2002, coinciding with the video album Hitomi Live Tour 2002 Huma- Rhythm. The two-disc compilation spanned Hitomi's eight-year career at that point; viewing it as the beginning of a fresh start, she devised a release \\"atypical\\" of the traditional greatest hits format. The first half of Self Portrait showcases material released after her previous compilation, H (1999), whereas the second half features new renditions of her earlier work, as well as one new song: \\"Vibes\\". It includes the single \\"Understanding\\", released merely weeks after her last album earlier that year, and a live recording of \\"Flow\\". Self Portrait debuted at number one on the Oricon Weekly Charts. It went on to become Hitomi's longest-charting album at twenty weeks, selling 636,000 copies in total and becoming the twenty-first highest selling album of 2002. Self Portrait received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commented on her artistic growth. At the 17th Japan Gold Disc Awards, the release received an accolade for Rock & Pop Album of the Year.  Background and development  In February 1999, Avex Trax released Hitomi's first greatest hits album, H. It chronicled her work with music producer Tetsuya Komuro, whose managerial role dissolved the year prior as Hitomi sought greater creative control over her career. Hitomi subsequently began working with Zentaro Watanabe and Dai Nagano; her next album Thermo Plastic (1999), matched the prior success she attained under Komuro, which \\"[laid] to rest fears that she would struggle without her onetime mentor.\\" In July 2002, the website Yeah!! J-Pop! reported that Hitomi would be releasing a new best album (ベストアルバム), then-untitled. In an interview with CD Data magazine, Hitomi explained that H (1999) felt like she was \\"looking back on the past,\\" whereas Self Portrait is deemed as a \\"halfway stage\\" towards \\"an ideal I want to reach,\\" further marking the release as \\"a declaration that I will continue 'sketching' from this point on, too.\\" She developed the compilation after a period of reflection, stating: Hitomi had a desire to introduce fans of \\"Samurai Drive\\" and \\"Love 2000\\" to songs like \\"There Is...\\" and \\"Taion\\" (体温, \\"Body Temperature\\"), which she considered to be \\"a selection that make up a key point in [my] past\\". From this, the idea of rearrangements came about, and Hitomi turned her focus towards fashioning a \\"rebirth\\" for her Komuro-era songs. In speaking to Beat Freak, during the album's development, it became a topic that she thought it would be \\"boring to just release an ordinary best album,\\" noting that little time had passed since H three years prior. Hitomi told the magazine that: \\"I feel that this best album is like a new start for me. [...] I've been wanting to seek someone different from who I am right now.\\"  Composition and material  Self Portrait is presented as a two-disc release, delineating Hitomi's career into two distinct periods. Whereas the second half of Self Portrait is distinguished by Hitomi's early work under music producer Testuya Komuro, the introductory half chronicles her collaboration with Zentaro Watanabe. The first disc contains nearly every single from Thermo Plastic (1999), Love Life (2000), and Huma-rhythm (2002), bar \\"Inner Child\\", \\"Wish\\" and \\"Made to be in Love\\" from their triple A-side release with \\"Kimi no Tonari\\" (君のとなり). The singles \\"Maria\\" and \\"Kimi no Tonari\\" are rearrangements found on their parent albums, with the latter being a first press bonus track originally. Furthermore, the disc includes the album tracks \\"Fat Free\\" and \\"Why?\\". The second disc is a selection of singles from Go to the Top (1995), By Myself (1996) and Déjà-vu (1997), otherwise known as her Komuro era. Each Komuro song was re-recorded, though new arrangements accompany \\"Candy Girl\\", \\"Busy Now\\" and \\"In the Future\\". \\"Go to the Top\\" is a \\"duet\\" between Hitomi's original and newly-recorded vocals. In addition, the second disc features a live recording of \\"Flow\\" performed at the Nippon Budokan, and new song \\"Vibes\\".  Release and promotion  The album artwork was photographed by longtime collaborator Hidekazu Maiyama in Sicily, Italy; a photo book chronicling the ten-day shoot was published two months later with the same cover. The concert DVD Hitomi Live Tour 2002 Huma-Rhythm, whose release coincided with the Self Portrait compilation, utilizes a similar photograph. Hitomi made extensive TV promotions throughout August and September 2002, including a performance of \\"Flow\\" on the August 26, 2002, broadcast of Hey! Hey Hey! Music Champ, and subsequent appearances on NHK Sokuhō! Uta no Daijiten! (速報! 歌の大辞テン!) on September 11, and NHK BS2 Hits on! Live on September 19, 2002. The compilation was further supported by a two-day concert at the Yoyogi National Stadium; entitled Hitomi Count Down Live 2002 Self Portrait, it was held on December 30 and 31, 2002, in the venue's second gymnasium.  Track listing  Notes * A majority of the song titles are stylized in all caps (e.g. \\"LOVE 2000\\", \\"IS IT YOU?\\", \\"SAMURAI DRIVE\\") * \\"There Is...\\", \\"Innocence\\", \\"Kimi no Tonari (Thermo Plastic Version)\\", \\"Problem\\", \\"By Myself\\" and \\"Flow\\" are stylized in lowercase letters * \\"I Am\\" and \\"In the Future\\" are stylized using sentence case (e.g. \\"In the future\\")  Chart performance  According to SoundScan Japan, Self Portrait debuted at number one and moved 275,440 copies in its first week. It held steady within the top five in its next two weeks, and marked 541,899 copies in total before it dropped out of the top twenty in its eighth week. The compilation performed similarly on the Oricon Weekly Album Chart, where it debuted at number one and charted for twenty weeks in total. Self Portrait sold over 636,000 copies in total by the end of 2002. Self Portrait debuted and peaked at number seven on the Japan Top Albums chart according to the October 5, 2002, edition of Billboard magazine.  HTM: Tiartrop Fles  HTM: Tiartrop Fles (stylized as HTM〜TIARTROP FLES〜) is a compilation album by Japanese singer and songwriter Hitomi. It was released on October 16, 2003, through Avex Trax.

Ginard took care of her siblings growing up and did embroidering to support them alongside two older sisters. But the experience at her First Communion and the example of her two nun aunts caused her to think about entering the religious life as a nun. Ginard entered a religious order in 1921 having her parents give their assent (her parents once refused this request in 1914) and she set about tasks such as embroidering cloth for the altar and preparing bread for hosts. Ginard was killed during the onslaught of the Spanish Civil War a month after having gone into hiding when the conflict broke out. Her remains were discovered a short while later for burial. The beatification for the slain nun was initiated in the 1980s and culminated in 2005 after she was beatified in Saint Peter's Basilica. Life Ángela Ginard Martí was born on 3 April 1894 in Llucmajor as the third of nine children to Sebastián Ginard García and Margarita Martí Canals. Her father's retirement from the Civil Guard saw the Ginard's move to Palma de Mallorca when she was sixteen where the three eldest sisters (including herself) helped around the house and learnt to embroider and make hats. It was after her First Communion on 14 April 1905 that she had the desire to consecrate herself to Jesus Christ and realized that it would be through the religious life as a nun. It was also after this experience that she made frequent visits to the tabernacle where she would kneel in reflection before Him to further discern her vocation and to strengthen her own faith. Even the example of her two maternal aunts who were nuns had a profound effect on her growing up. But she admired one of those aunts in particular due to the contemplative life she led in her convent. Her sisters often went out with friends to the cinema or other social engagements while she preferred to remain at home to instruct her other siblings in catechism and the lives of the saints. In 1914 she asked her parents for permission to enter the convent her aunt was stationed in but her parents (her father in particular) opposed the idea and advised her to wait and think more on it. Ginard entered the Zelatrices of the Eucharistic Devotion in Palma de Mallorca on 26 November 1921 and assumed the religious name \\"Maria de los Ángeles\\"; she assumed the habit in May 1922 and then served as a postulant for six months before commencing her period of novitiate from 1922 to 1923. It was in 1923 that she made her initial profession and renewed it in 1926 (then being moved to the house in Madrid) before making her solemn profession later in 1929 in Barcelona where she was stationed until 1932 when she returned to Madrid. Ginard did embroidering for the cloths used for the altar and also prepared the bread that would be made into the Eucharistic hosts. But the conflict forced nuns and priests alike to go underground due to the danger against them so the nuns of her convent were forced on 20 July 1936 to disperse while using disguises to flee. During the conflict she hid in an apartment but was arrested during the afternoon on 25 August 1936. The guards who raided the apartment accused a woman of being another nun but Ginard stepped forward to confirm that she was the sole nun living in the apartment. The guards escorted her outside to a waiting car and drove off with her. Ginard was shot dead in a park either in the afternoon or evening on 26 August 1936 and her remains were left at the site of the killing. The next morning the sisters were looking through files at a government building and found pictures of her corpse. The sisters went to the site to reclaim her remains for a proper burial. Her remains were exhumed moved on 20 May 1941 and again in 1984 to the convent where she lived. Beatification The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 6 February 1987 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the edict declaring \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) and titled Ginard as a Servant of God. The diocesan process was held in Madrid with Cardinal Ángel Suquía Goicoechea inaugurating the investigation on 28 April 1987 and later closing on 23 March 1990; the C.C.S. later validated this process on 18 October 1991 and received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 1993 for additional assessment. Theologians assessed and approved the cause on 11 November 2003 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 17 February 2004. John Paul II granted the final approval needed for the cause on 19 April 2004 and confirmed that Ginard would soon be beatified after determining that she had died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) meaning no miracle was required for beatification. Her beatification had been scheduled for 24 April 2005 but the death of John Paul II weeks earlier meant that the beatification was pushed back. The beatification was later celebrated on 29 October 2005 in Saint Peter's Basilica with Cardinal José Saraiva Martins presiding on the behalf of Pope Benedict XVI.

The company also owns The Negros Chronicle, the longest running weekly newspaper in the city and the province of Negros Oriental. DYEM is the first FM radio station in Dumaguete and the second to launch FM broadcasting in the Visayas, being launched on March 26, 1980, and is currently one of Dumaguete's independent radio stations, next to Top 40 stations DYSR (formerly affiliated with Quest Broadcasting Inc.) and DYFU. The station was formerly affiliated with Ultrasonic Broadcasting System, which was then broadcast as \\"96.7 Energy FM\\" from 2000 until 2010 and \\"96.7 Star Energy FM\\" from 2010 until it was relaunched as its present brand name in October 2013 as DYMD now holds ownership and rights to the \\"Energy FM\\" brand. Its studios and transmitter facilities are located at 106 EJ Blanco Drive Piapi, Dumaguete. This station operates from 3:00 AM to 11:00 PM. History DYEM was first launched on March 26, 1980, becoming the Dumaguete's first FM radio station and second to open FM broadcasts in the Visayas island, next to Cebu when DYBU-FM and DYNC started FM broadcasts in 1975, with DYBU first airing in the AM band. In the 1990s, DYEM was known as \\"Love Radio\\", not to be confused with Manila Broadcasting Company's Love Radio Network. Its format consists of adult contemporary and soft rock music, that mimics Love Radio's former format, and is similar to DYRK in Cebu. The station later became popular with listeners because of its music format, its programming, which includes a weekly countdown program, and was also the \\"official radio station\\" for concerts held in Dumaguete. The \\"Love Radio\\" branding ended in 2000. In 1991, when DYGB began broadcasting as \\"Power95\\", at 95.7 MHz, DYEM's owner, Negros Broadcasting & Publishing Inc., filed a case against the owners, Gold Label Broadcasting Inc., because the station was broadcasting nearer to DYEM's frequency. DYGB's owners later responded to DYEM's case by moving DYGB to its current frequency, 91.7. In 2000, DYEM was renamed as \\"96.7 Energy FM\\", becoming an affiliate of the Ultrasonic Broadcasting System. In 2010, it was renamed as \\"Star Energy FM\\". On November 24, 2013, DYEM was rebranded as \\"96.7 Bai Radio\\", following DYMD becoming \\"93.7 Energy FM\\" in October and to prevent confusion having both stations branded as \\"Energy FM\\".

It flowers in the autumn, the thread-like leaves appearing after the flowers. Flowers may be solitary or in a group of two or three. The flower has six milky white tepals, 8–14 mm long, each with a sharp point at the apex (at least in the outer three). Acis valentina resembles the spring-flowering Acis nicaeense in several ways, including possessing a six-lobed disc at the base of the ovary. Taxonomy Acis valentina was first described in 1914 by Carlos Pau, as Leucojum valentinum. It was transferred to the genus Acis, along with other species of Leucojum, in 2004. Its nearest relative appears to be Acis ionica, found in the Balkans. Distribution and habitat The native distribution of Acis valentina is eastern Spain, north of Valencia. It has also been recorded as occurring in the Ionian Islands of Greece; however these plants are now assigned to Acis ionica. It is found in rocky pastures.

Description It is a cylindrically shaped, slender fish, similar in shape to the bluntnose minnow (Pimephalus notatus), with a blunt snout and a slightly oblique mouth which has an upper lip which is much thicker in the middle than at the corners. It has a dark lateral band and a large eye which has a diameter of roughly a quarter of the length of the head. It has a dark- olive back and creamy white underparts with a well defined dark lateral band which terminates in a spot just before the caudal fin with a small dark spot often found on the front of the dorsal fin. The breeding male has three rows of 12 tubercles and the dorsal fin, anal fin and caudal fin become tinged with orange while the pectoral fins turn black with a white leading edge. the head often turns black too. It is the smallest species in the genus Pimephales with the adults normally being with a maximum length of . It has 8 soft rays in the rather rounded dorsal fin and seven in the anal fin. Distribution It is found in southern Missouri, eastern Kansas, Arkansas, and northeastern Oklahoma where they are restricted to the Ozarks, particularly in the drainage basins of the Red and Arkansas rivers as well as in some independent tributaries of Mississippi. It has also been recorded in a pond in the drainage of the Osage River in Kansas where it was probably released by an angler using the fish as bait. Habitat and ecology The slim minnow occurs in sand-bottomed and gravel-bottomed pools and stretches of creeks and small rivers. It is a sociable species which forms schools in the middle or bottom of the water column and, unlike other Pimephalus species can often be found swimming in the current. It breeds in May–July and spawning is thought to occur in the swifter riffles. The breeding males become territorial, establishing a nest site in a suitable crevice, for example in a stone or cobble and begin to display at females. Females approached the nest and when mating they adhered the eggs to the substrate while pressed against the male which simultaneously fertilised them. The eggs eventually form a cluster adhered to the underside of the rock and the female leaves them to be guarded, cleaned and aerated by the male. The males will try to mate with any available females. The eggs hatch after 6 days and the fry drop to the bottom after hatching, paternal care stops and the fry are often preyed upon by adult fish. Females lay between 37 and 209 eggs in a season with a mean of 83.

She decided to settle there permanently and opened her own studio where she trained a whole generation of Estonian opera singers. She organized concert performances featuring her students and also composed several art songs for them to sing at the concerts. With the Soviet occupation of Estonia, she was arrested as an enemy alien in 1941 and deported to a prison camp in Karaganda in what is now Kazakhstan. She is presumed to have died there in 1946.

The temple covers a total area of about , it preserves the basic architectural pattern of the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1912). The temple has over 400 buildings and the seven main halls along the central axis are the Guanyin Hall, Great Manjusri Hall, Great Buddha Hall, Amitaba Hall, Qianbo Hall, Copper Hall and Buddhist Texts Library. Mount Wutai has 47 Buddhist temples, it is the largest Buddhist complex in China, Xiantong Temple is the largest one with the longest history. History =Eastern Han dynasty= Xiantong Temple is situated in the north of Taihuai Town of Mount Wutai in Shanxi. The temple was first established in the Yongping period (58-75) in the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220) and initially called \\"Dafu Lingjiu Temple\\" (). =Northern Wei dynasty= In the period of the Northern Wei dynasty (386-534), the temple was expanded and renamed as \\"Huayuan Temple\\" (). =Tang dynasty= The temple was reconstructed in the period of Emperor Taizong (599-649) of Tang dynasty (618-907) with the name of \\"Great Huayan Temple\\" (). =Ming dynasty= In the period of Hongwu (1368-1398) in the early Ming dynasty (1368-1644), the temple was renovated and renamed \\"Great Xiantong Temple\\" (). The name was changed to \\"Great Jixiang Xiantong Temple\\" () in the period of Yongle Emperor (1402-1424) and \\"Great Huguo Shengguang Yongming Temple\\" () in the period of Wanli Emperor (1572-1620). =Qing dynasty= In 1687, in the period of Emperor Kangxi (1661-1722) in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), the temple was renamed as \\"Great Xiantong Temple\\" again. =People's Republic of China= After the establishment of the Communist State in 1954, the local government repaired the side halls. In 1957 the Amitaba Hall was restored. From 1974 to 1977, the West Chan Buddhism Hall was restored. In 1979, the Buddhist Texts Library was restored. In 1982, it was listed among the second group of \\"State Cultural Protection Relics Units\\" by the State Council of China. In 1983 it has been designated as a \\"National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area\\". In 1984, the granary was restored. The Mahavira Hall was added to the temple in 2004. Architecture The Xiantong temple consists of 400 buildings. The overall gorgeous and elegant colors with characteristics of the palace buildings reflect the precise layout and rich, beautiful and dignified style in the Ming and Qing dynasty (1368-1912). =Amitaba Hall= The brick Amitaba Hall () is the fourth hall along the central axis of Xiantong Temple and gets its name from the Amitaba Buddha (Vairocana Buddha; ) enshrined in it. It is also called \\"Beamless Hall\\" () since it is built with blue bricks without pillars or columns. =Qianbo Hall= The Qianbo Hall () is behind the Amitaba Hall. The hall, for the worship of a copper statue of Manjushri with a thousand alms bowls (). The statue of Manjushri has five heads stacked and six hands in front, two of which hold a gold alms bowl in each. There is a sitting statue of Sakyamuni Buddha in the bowl. A thousand hands stretch from the back of the statue with gold alms bowls of a sitting statue of Sakyamuni Buddha in each hand. The statue of Manjushri was made in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and also known as \\"Statue of Manjushri with a Thousand Alms Bowls\\" (). Its unique style is rare in China. =Copper Hall= The pure copper made Copper Hall behind the Qianbo Hall is a rarer cultural relic in China. The hall is high, wide and deep. The plane of the hall is square, nine chi wide (1 chi=1/3 meter), eight chi deep and two zhang (1 zhang=10/3 meters). Though with two-story appearance, the hall is actually one story with a room, four pillars and drum-shaped column bases inside. Upper layer of Xiantong Temple is carved with six partition boards and the lower is with eight ones. Ten thousand of golden and spectacular small Buddha statues are carved on the walls of the hall. There are also exquisite and delicate color paintings and patterns of flowers, birds and animals engraved on the columns, architraves and partition boards. The Copper Hall was mentioned in Records of Qingliang Mountain (), which read: \\"the Copper Hall was built by senior monk Miaofeng () of Mount Wutai with of copper in the period of Wanli Emperor (1573-1620) in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644)\\". =Long Toll Bell= The brass bell hanging in the Bell Tower in front of the temple was cast between 1621 and 1627 during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) weighing . Outside of the bell cast over ten thousand words of Buddhist inscriptions. When the bell rings, the toll can be heard very far away. Therefore, it is called the \\"Long Toll Bell\\" (), also known as the \\"Longevity Bell\\" () because in Chinese \\"long toll\\" and \\"longevity\\" have the same pronunciation.

The trimeric assemblies are stabilized by multiple hydrogen bonds. Influence of Ara h 3 in peanut allergies The protein Ara h 3 plays an important role in peanut allergic reactions. Ara h 3 makes up 19% of the total protein in peanut extracts and is classified as a major peanut allergen because it provokes sensitization of patients with this allergy. This protein is a very potent allergen and it causes a severe reaction. The symptoms can be: * Skin reaction: urticarial, redness or edema. * Itchy reaction: usually around the mouth and throat. * Digestive problems: such as diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting. * Breath problems: it has a relation with the inflammation reaction which causes the blockage of the air passages. * Heart problems: histamine can cause a coronary artery spasm. * Anaphylaxis: a whole-body allergic reaction that causes low blood pressure, suffocation and can bring a person to death. Treatment No treatment is currently available, avoidance is the only option for peanut-allergic individuals. Unfortunately, consumers can be inadvertently exposed to peanut allergens when food becomes contaminated from processing lines shared with other peanut products. Therefore, there can be labelling mistakes because companies may not include peanuts as ingredients.

Overview The suggested options for sending a spacecraft to ʻOumuamua within a time-frame of 5 to 10 years are based on using first a Jupiter flyby followed by a close solar flyby at 3 solar radii in order to take advantage of the Oberth effect or more advanced options such as a solar sail and a laser sail. Detail ʻOumuamua was at first thought to be traveling too fast for any existing spacecraft to reach. The Initiative for Interstellar Studies (i4is) launched Project Lyra to assess the feasibility of a mission to ʻOumuamua. Several options for sending a spacecraft to ʻOumuamua within a time-frame of 5 to 25 years were suggested. The challenge is to get to the asteroid in a reasonable amount of time (and so at a reasonable distance from Earth), and yet be able to gain useful scientific information. To do this, decelerating the spacecraft at ʻOumuamua would be \\"highly desirable, due to the minimal science return from a hyper-velocity encounter\\". If the investigative craft goes too fast, it would not be able to get into orbit or land on the asteroid and would fly past it. The authors conclude that, although challenging, an encounter mission would be feasible using near- term technology. Seligman and Laughlin adopt a complementary approach to the Lyra study but also conclude that such missions, though challenging to mount, are both feasible and scientifically attractive. One option is using first a Jupiter flyby followed by a close solar flyby at in order to take advantage of the Oberth effect. Different mission durations and their velocity requirements were explored with respect to the launch date, assuming direct impulsive transfer to the intercept trajectory. A spacecraft with a mass of tens of kilograms using a heat shield like that in the Parker Solar Probe and a Falcon Heavy-class launcher with a trajectory including a powered Jupiter flyby and a solar Oberth maneuver could reach 1I/ʻOumuamua if launched in 2021. More advanced options of using solar, laser electric, and laser sail propulsion, based on Breakthrough Starshot technology, have also been considered.

Both the genus and the species were named by the American malacologist Alan Solem. The genus is endemic to the Fijian island of Viti Levu, and ' is an endangered species. Taxonomic history Alan Solem, the curator of invertebrates at the Field Museum of Natural History, created the genus Ba for his newly-described species '. Solem based his description of the type species ' on a holotype which the American malacologist Yoshio Kondo had collected in 1938 and three paratypes. One paratype was deposited in the Field Museum; the remaining specimens in the type series were deposited in the Bishop Museum. =Etymology= Solem chose the generic name Ba after Ba District, Fiji, which extends into ' range. This led to him having an \\"irresistible impulse\\" to name the type species ', in reference to the character Ebenezer Scrooge's catchphrase \\"Bah! Humbug!\\" from Charles Dickens's novella A Christmas Carol. One review of Solem's monograph naming this species said his choice in taxa names \\"may either lighten the reader's day or engender hostility\\", giving this binomen as an example. Distribution ' is endemic to Fiji. It is found in the interior of Viti Levu, an island in Fiji, at elevations of . The holotype was collected in dense forest on Mount Nangaranambulata at an elevation of . Two paratypes were collected on the top of Mount Korobamba at an elevation of . The third paratype was collected in the Sanganaoreva area inland of Ngaloa, Nuku District at an elevation of . Description Ba is characterized by having a high spire and an umbilicus which is either completely closed or slightly laterally cracked. There are only 3⅛–3½ whorls, and its apical sculpture consists of about a dozen spiral cords. There are no barriers to its aperture. ' has a shell with a diameter of . The height-to-diameter ratio ranges from 0.752 to 0.842. Its shell is a light reddish-yellow; its periostracal extensions are an almost black dark brown. The body is yellow- white and lacks any sort of dark markings. Biology ' is sympatric with Sinployea irregularis; both species were found under the same log. It is probably strictly terrestrial due to a lack of black marks on its body. Conservation status and threats According to the IUCN Red List, ' is endangered. They note that only four specimens have been found despite many surveys on Viti Levu over a century and a half. The IUCN estimates an area of occupancy of , and its habitat continues to decline due to deforestation.

As a two-year-old in 2001 she showed considerable promise, taking the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes on the second of her two starts. In the following year she failed to win but showed top class form to finish second in four Group 1 races: the Irish 1,000 Guineas, the Epsom Oaks, the Irish Oaks and the Nassau Stakes. After retiring from racing at the end of the year she became a successful broodmare whose foals have included the Pretty Polly Stakes winner Diamondsandrubies. Background Quarter Moon is a bay mare with no white markings bred in Ireland by Premier Bloodstock, a breeding company owned by John Magnier of the Coolmore Stud and Richard Henry. During her racing career she was owned by Susan Magnier and Richard Henry's wife Roisin and was trained at Ballydoyle by Aidan O'Brien. She was ridden in all of her races by Mick Kinane. She was from the fourteenth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Quarter Moon's dam Jude showed little ability as a racehorse, failing to win in four starts before being sold to Premier Bloodstock for 92,000 guineas as a three-year-old. She made more impact as a broodmare, with her other foals including Yesterday and All My Loving (third in the Epsom Oaks). Jude's dam Alruccaba was an influential broodmare whose other descendants have included Alborada, Allegretto (Prix Royal Oak), Aussie Rules (Poule d'Essai des Poulains) and Albanova (Preis von Europa). Racing career =2001: two- year-old season= Rather than making her first appearance in a maiden race Quarter Moon made her track debut in the Group 3 Debutante Stakes over seven furlongs on soft ground at the Curragh on 19 August. Starting at odds of 5/1 she was restrained in the early stages before producing a strong late run and failing by only a head to overhaul the Dermot Weld-trained favourite Saranac Lake. Two weeks later the filly was stepped up to Group 1 class and started the 7/4 favourite for the Moyglare Stud Stakes over the same course and distance. Her sixteen opponents included Sophisticat (also trained by O'Brien), Seba (winner of the Chesham Stakes), Dress To Thrill (Tyros Stakes), High Society (Rochestown Stakes), Mahsusie (Marble Hill Stakes) and Miss Beabea (runner-up in the Phoenix Stakes). Kinane restrained the favourite in the early stages as the O'Brien-trained outsider Ardara set the pace, but made a forward move a quarter of a mile from the finish. Quarter Moon took the lead inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length and a neck from Dress To Thrill and Sophisticat. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"Quarter Moon has always looked special and is in all the top fillies races later this year. She looks a real prospect for next season\\". =2002: three-year-old season= Quarter Moon began her second campaign in the 189th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 5 May and started the 9/1 fifth choice in the betting. After pulling hard in the early stages she kept on well in the last quarter mile and finished fifth of the seventeen runners, less than two lengths behind the winner Kazzia. In the Irish 1000 Guineas three weeks later the filly was beaten into second by the British-trained Gossamer after coming from ninth place three furlongs out. Quarter Moon was then moved up in distance for the Epsom Oaks over one and a half miles on unusually soft ground on 7 June and started 15/2 fourth favourite behind Kazzia, Islington and Mellow Park. After racing towards the rear of the fourteen-runner field as Kazzia set the pace, before moving up to join the leader in the straight. The two fillies drew away from the others in the last quarter mile with Quarter Moon eventually going down to the favourite by half a length. There was a gap of more than fourteen lengths back to Shadow Dancing in third. The Guardian reported that she deserved \\"immense credit\\" for her performance. The Daily Telegraphs correspondent commented that she was \\"gallant in defeat\\", pointing out that she had been running on less favourable ground than the winner, who had raced up the stands side rail. On 14 July at the Curragh Quarter Moon started the 4/5 favourite for the Irish Oaks but after taking the lead in the straight she was overtaken inside the final furlong and beaten a length by the 33/1 outsider Margarula. The filly was then brought back in distance for the Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse on 3 August and started favourite. She appeared to be \\"reluctant\\" before the race and finished third of the ten runners behind Islington and Sulk. She failed to produce her best form in the Yorkshire Oaks later that month and came home sixth of the eleven runners behind Islington. Onher her final appearance she was sent to France to contest the Prix de l'Opéra over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 6 October and finished unplaced in a race won by Bright Sky.

The fuselage and tail of the Goose were mated to a new tilting wing and engine configuration;McGowen 2005, p.180. the maximum angle of incidence allowed was only 50 degrees; the rotorprop was expected to provide sufficient thrust to allow VTOL operations despite the low angle. Operational history Delivered in late 1959, the K-16B underwent extensive wind tunnel testing, along with some tethered hops, to evaluate the tiltwing configuration's aerodynamic characteristics. Flight testing was originally anticipated to begin in the fall of 1960, however these preliminary tests continued into 1962.

She began teaching at the age of fifteen. In 1869, she published a volume of poems, and, the same year, gave her first public lecture. Beginning in 1872, she was frequently called before the public as a speaker. Early years and education Augusta Cooper was born in Croydon, New Hampshire, April 17, 1835. She was the youngest of a family of ten children of Col. Otis and Hannah (Powers) Cooper. Her first verses were written at the age of eight, and she had poems published when only fifteen. She excelled in mathematics and showed in her early life an aptitude for logical and philosophical reasoning. The greater part of her education was acquired in a public school, but she was also a student in Canaan Union Academy and Kimball Union Academy. Career Bristol began teaching at fifteen during summer and winter for seven years. At the age of twenty-two, she married G. H. Kimball, from whom she was divorced five years later. In 1866, she married Louis Bristol, a lawyer of New Haven, Connecticut, and they removed to southern Illinois. In 1869, she published a volume of poems, of which, a review by The Congregationalist and Boston Recorder noted: \\"In Poems by Augusta Cooper Bristol, we fail to discern any remarkable poetic power. They seem to be characterized bya considerable command of language, and something of the poetic temper, with a good deal of the now fashionable cant of 'insight' and 'nature' and non-capital punishment, and things of that kind.\\" In the same year, she gave her first public lecture, which changed the course of her intellectual career. In 1872, she moved to Vineland, New Jersey, from which date she developed herself as a platform speaker before the public. For four years, she was president of the Ladies' Social Science Class in Vineland, giving lessons from Herbert Spencer and Henry Charles Carey every month. In the winter of 1880, she gave a course of lectures before the New York Positivist Society on \\"The Involution of Character,\\" followed by another course under the auspices of the Woman's Social Science Club of that city. In the following June, she was sent by friends in New York City to study the equitable association of labor and capital at the Familistère, in Guise, France, founded by Jean-Baptiste André Godin. She was also commissioned to represent the New York Positivist Society in an international convention of liberal thinkers in Brussels in September. Remaining in the Familistere for three months and giving a lecture on the \\"Scientific Basis of Morality\\" before the Brussels convention, she returned home and published the \\"Rules and Statutes\\" of the association in Guise. In 1881, she was chosen State lecturer of the Patrons of Husbandry in New Jersey. In the autumn of the following year, was employed on a national lecture bureau of that order. Augusta Cooper Bristol (1894) After her husband's death in 1882, she seldom appeared upon the platform, but was one of the speakers in the World's Congress of Representative Women at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1893). She was occupied with the care of an estate and in directing the educational interests of her youngest daughter. Some of her philosophic and scientific lectures were translated and published in foreign countries. She died May 9, 1910 in Vineland.

Fighting then broke out between the Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh as the Saudi-led coalition began bombing Houthi areas, ultimately resulting in Saleh's death and a Houthi victory.  Background  The Houthis had formed a tactical alliance with Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemeni President in 1990-2012, after he was deposed in the 2011 Yemeni revolution to which Houthis themselves had contributed. Houthis were also dissatisfied with the new Yemeni president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi who was appointed by the Gulf Cooperation Council and didn't let them a share in the government among other reasons. The dissatisfaction turned into widespread protests when Hadi government ordered removal of fuel subsidies. Houthis organized mass protests and advanced into the capital, Sanaa, taking over government buildings but Hadi and his cabinet finally suddenly resigned leaving office in the hands of Houthis. Soon afterwards, the Saudis led a military intervention in Yemen upon Hadi request against Houthis to restore him to power. Houthis and Saleh forces shared administration of the capital and the country since then. Pro-Saleh forces controlled Southern Sana'a while Houthis were in control of the northern part of the capital. The tactical alliance between Saleh, who was deposed in 2012, and the Houthis has often appeared fragile, with both groups suspicious of each other's ultimate motives and sharing little ideological ground.  Battle  Anti-Houthi protests in Sana'a. (2 December 2017) On 2 December 2017, four days after the eruption of armed conflict between the Houthis and forces loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh, he announced his readiness to start a \\"new page\\" with Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, a move which was welcome by the two governments. On 4 December 2017, Saleh officially announced the end of his partnership with the Houthis while Saudi Arabia warplanes were bombing Houthi positions in Sana'a in support of Saleh. The conflict took at least 125 lives and injured 238. According to Ra'iy al-Youm, Saleh's split was an outcome of long-term efforts by Saudi Arabia and the UAE to unravel the Houthi-Saleh alliance after their failure to defeat the Houthis militarily. It was reported on 4 December that the Bani Bahloul tribe in Yemen gained control of posts of Houthi militias in southern Sanaa. The tribes of al Hima and Hamadan reportedly controlled other Houthi posts and arrested dozens of Houthi militants, according to Sky News. Also, supervisor of the Houthi militias Abu Mohsen al Qahoum was killed in clashes with General People's Congress (GPC) forces in Sha'oub district of Sanaa. Despite this, the battle turned increasingly against the Saleh loyalists, with GPC secretary general Aref al-Zouka being killed in combat. Many GPC members and Saleh fighters also defected to the Houthis. = Death of Saleh = On 4 December 2017, having declared Saleh and his militias as \\"treasonous\\", Houthis disabled his vehicle with a rocket-propelled grenade in an ambush when he was on his way to Ma'rib while trying to flee into Saudi-controlled territories and he was subsequently shot in the head by a Houthi sniper when he was trying to leave Sana'a for Ma'arib. In response, his son Ahmed, former commander of the Republican Guard, pledged vengeance against Houthis. After Saleh's death the forces aligned with him routed and their commanders fled the city and fighting in the city subsequently ceased but Saudi-led coalition started pounding areas in the city. Saleh's death is described as an embarrassment in a long list of Saudi foreign policy failures under Mohammad bin Salman. The death toll from clashes between GPC forces and Houthi militias in Sanaa has exceeded 200. On 4 December, The Houthi leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, congratulated the people for \\"the fall of the conspiracy\\" that he alleged was instigated by Saudi Arabia and UAE. \\"We were aware of this conspiracy before it happened and we tried so hard to prevent it in a fraternal way, but the other side was always evasive. We were aware of coordination with the force of aggression and intensive military preparations before they finally reached what they did,\\" he added. Abdul-Malik also noted that it was a certain number of militias and the top leader (Saleh) of the GPC that participated in the sedition while praising \\"many honorable members of the Congress\\" who helped Houthis to settle things down.  Aftermath  alt= On 5 December, tens of thousands of pro-Houthi demonstrators took to the streets in Sanaa. Almasirah, the official Ansar Allah website, reported that the rally was held to \\"thank God\\" for the failure of the revolt. The crowd, waving Yemen's national flag, chanted slogans such as \\"ours is a free revolution, we reject colonization.. through unity and resilience, we defeated the Jewish alliance\\", according to the website. The rally was reported to have been attended by a large number of women as well as members of GPC who stated that the plot was aimed at the entire people of Yemen without exception. The celebration has been broadly confirmed by other sources. A large part of the GPC consequently pledged allegiance to the Houthis, and elected Sadeq Ameen Abu Rass as new chairman. Those GPC elements which stayed loyal to the Saleh family retreated into Hadi-controlled areas and began to rebuild their military strength to fight the Houthis.

Lankesh, in his directorial debut. He also stars, alongside Vimala Naidu and T. N. Seetharam. The film is based on his own 1967 novella Biruku (), and focuses on two lovers whose relationship ends when the man fails in life while the woman succeeds. Pallavi won three National Film Awards: Second Best Feature Film, Best Feature Film in Kannada and Best Direction. It also won five Karnataka State Film Awards: Best Film, Best Direction (Lankesh), Best Music (Rajeev Taranath), Best Screenplay and Best Dialogues (Lankesh).  Plot  Shanta (Vimala Naidu) is a bouncy university teenager who idolises film actresses. She is as idealistic as her boyfriend Chandru. The two apply for jobs; while Chandru is rejected because of his rudeness, Shanta is accepted because of her charm and self-confidence. Chandru ends his relationship with Shanta. Shanta eventually marries her boss, Jagannathan (P. Lankesh). Shanta then combines her new leisurely existence as a sophisticated wife with traditional chores and rituals. Boredom and pregnancy overcome her. Chandru suddenly resurfaces, a fugitive from justice. Shanta is initially intrigued by his attitudes which are very much in opposition to hers. But when Chandru harangues Shanta for resigning herself to security and a constricting marriage, she refuses to go with him, and accuses him of abandoning her in the first place. He threatens to destroy her world, but is finally overpowered by the police. Shanta is left to carry on with her undisturbed, uneventful life.  Production  Pallavi is novelist P. Lankesh's directorial debut. It is based on his own 1967 novella Biruku. In his 1997 autobiography Huli-Maavina Mara (), Lankesh claimed that his passion for making films led him to direct a film without any prior experience in the field. The film was produced by K. S. Indira Lankesh under the banner Indira Lankesh Productions. Cinematography was handled by S. Ramachandra. T. N. Seetharam made his acting debut with this film. Principal photography began on the same day as the declaration of \\"the Emergency\\". P. Lankesh's voice was dubbed by T. S. Ranga.  Themes  Pallavi deals with themes such as student union revolution, college life, and unemployment issues in the hands of bureaucrats. According to the 1998 edition of Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema, it was one of only three films to have direct political and formal links with the Navya Movement.  Music  The music of the film was composed by Rajeev Taranath.  Reception  Peter Cowie wrote in the book International Film Guide 1978, \\"Pallavi has some of the flaws common to a first film (Lankesh, much admired as a Kannada writer, is new to the cinema), but is actually very competent and unswerving in its denunciation of the primitive role still accorded to most Indian women.\\" At the 24th National Film Awards, Pallavi won in three categories: Second Best Feature Film, Best Feature Film in Kannada and Best Direction for Lankesh. It won in five categories at the Karnataka State Film Awards: Best Film, Best Direction (Lankesh), Best Music (Rajeev Taranath), Best Screenplay and Best Dialogues (Lankesh).  Impact  In the book A Handbook of Karnataka, historian Suryanath U. Kamath considered Pallavi, amongst many other films, to be responsible for establishing the 1970s as the \\"age of the new-wave or experimental films\\" in Karnataka.

It has been criticized for anti-male sentiment. It split from Megalia, another feminist online community based in South Korea. Overview WOMAD split from Megalia on January 22, 2016. It formed due to Megalia issuing a ban on the use of certain explicit slurs against gay men. This change in policy led to the migration of anti-transgender members. WOMAD has caused controversy due to extreme online trolling such as postings that boast animal abuse and show extreme hatred towards transgender people; for this reason, WOMAD has been called \\"Korean-style TERFs\\" It was embroiled in a number of accusations for mocking Korean War veterans and labor rights activists. A number of posts mocking the deceased actor Kim Joo-hyuk caused further controversy. Following such incidents, critics lambasted WOMAD as a \\"hateful website that is aggravating conflict and division of society\\" among South Koreans. Its tough stance is represented in several places on the web site. It uses red Hakenkreuz symbol in 'thumbs-up' button, with '워념글 추천' written below, meaning 'suggest this as an insightful article' in Korean. Its favicon is a representation of a vulva, with red dot at the center of it representing both period blood and fire. It claims to mirror misogyny in Korean society, particularly Ilbe. Incidents = Claims of murders targeting men = In 2016, multiple posts appeared on the site, claiming that they have killed men with titles such as \\"I fed men coffee mixed with car antifreeze liquid\\", \\"I killed a man by pushing him into a reservoir\\" and \\"I aborted a male baby.\\" The Ulsan Metropolitan Police Agency and the Gwangju Metropolitan Police Agency started an investigation after receiving police reports on 28 July 2016. Several shutdown requests have been made against the community, but Daum Kakao dismissed the requests stating that \\"some posts have been hidden, but there is insufficient illegal activity within the community to shut it down\\". = Child-abuse incident in Australia = On November 19, 2017, an anonymous member wrote a post on the WOMAD forum claiming that she had raped an Australian boy. WOMAD members showed support for the writer, leaving comments saying that they would pay to watch the videos of the sexual assault. News of the post quickly spread online and a petition was started on Cheong Wa Dae’s bulletin board requesting that the person responsible be caught. On November 20, 2017, a 27-year-old Korean woman identified as \\"Areum Lee\\" was arrested by the Australian Federal Police in Darwin, Northern Territory in relation to the incident. The suspect is charged with producing child abuse materials. AFP announced that she will remain in custody until a court hearing scheduled for mid-January 2018. According to interviews with the victim's parents, it is suspected that her identification and credentials are fake and that she could have broken immigration and labor laws. WOMAD members actively defended her, claimed that Areum Lee was innocent and conducted an online fundraiser for her lawyer appointment. In addition, they sent a petition to the Australian police to \\"release Areum Lee\\" and protested the victim's parents. Many were shocked by this incident.

Athens, Sokolis, 1979 Ziras Alex In 1977 he received the poetry award from the Academy of Athens for all his work and especially for his book Cloudless Silence (Greek: \\"Αιθρία σιγή\\"). In 1995, he was honoured with the Greek National Prize of Poetry.  Biography  Oikonomou was born on the Greek island of Skiathos, where he also spent his childhood years. His father was a captain and owner of a sailing ship. He died when Zisis Oikonomou was 10 years old. His mother managed to raise him and his two siblings by working on the loom and trading in carpets from Skiathos. Zisis Oikonomou belongs to the interwar generation of Greek poets. His poetic career covers a widespread thematic and stylistic range. In the literature he first appeared in 1930 with a publication of verses in the Athenian journal Nea Genia. In 1934 his first collection of poems was published. In the Greek- Italian War (1940/41) Oikonomou was an interpreter of Italian and German in the staff of the 3rd Military Corps. In 1941–45, during the Greek occupation, a small ship served as a residence for him and his wife Eugenia (née Deligianni). They travelled the islands and oceans of the northern Aegean Sea and the Gulf of Euboea – until they were suspected and harassed in interrogations by Italians, Germans and even by their own compatriots. His excellent language skills, his sincerity and fearlessness helped Oikonomou to escape the many dangerous situations of that time. Oikonomou was extremely linguistically gifted. He was fluent in 10 languages and dealt with cross- cultural, cross-class and cross-political life issues. Oikonomou was passionate about travelling. He published his experiences, insights and impressions in magazines and newspapers – with his name, but also with a pseudonym. From the mid-50s until 1976, he interrupted his publications and dealt with research on linguistics, sociology and politics. His main objective was to search for a unified worldview that draws elements from all areas of science and knowledge. Starting from the optimistic worldview of futurism and surrealism and praising modern technologies, he quickly entered into the phase of retreat and reservation against western rationalism and turned towards an individualistic worldview, influenced by the study of Eastern religions (mainly of Buddhism) and philosophers like Schopenhauer, Berdyaev and Keyserling. This search also affected his poetry, whose language became increasingly simple and effective. Oikonomou also dealt with the theatre and wrote several pieces. During his time in Athens many acquaintances and good friendships developed. Among his intellectual and literary friends in Athens were Dimis Apostolopoulos, Sarantaris, Varikas, Ritsos and Kazantzakis. Oikonomou always remained an impartial researcher. His non-conformist, free thinking and acting often aroused the resistance of his compatriots and literary colleagues. In his old age Oikonomou returned to his home island Skiathos.  Works  The literary work of Zisi Oikonomou comprises the areas of poetry, diaries, essays, studies and theatre. = Poetry = * Η εποποιία των αγενών μετάλλων. 1934. * Ο κόσμος στη δύση του. 1935. * Ανάρρωση. 1935. * Τοπία. 1936. * Η προσευχή της γης.

Then, the next day at Prayers, the other students also notice the absence of their Science mistress, but they are satisfied when the headteacher informed that she has received a resignation letter from Miss Bell. Daisy and Hazel, however, are not. Together, they work tirelessly to piece together the clues and solve the mystery. In the end, they come across an old notebook, which turns out to be the diary of Verity Abraham, the girl who was rumored to have committed suicide by jumping off the Gym some few years ago. The diary serves as evidence that Miss Griffin, the headmistress has spoken to her a few weeks ago and informed her that she was Verity’s true Mother and Mr and Mrs Abraham had adopted her. Miss Griffin had become an unmarried mother, which at the time was not considered normal and would have affected her chances of becoming headmistress. Verity forbids this fact, but Miss Griffin then provides her with evidence of her birth and the adoption, too. Then, she asks Verity to join her as her daughter, but Verity denies and says Mr. and Mrs. Abraham are her parents. Reception In its review, The Oxford Times praised Stevens for her \\"sense of place ... attention to detail, in-depth characters, authentic documents of events and, most importantly, absorbing plot\\". The website Crime Review called Murder Most Unladylike \\"an assured and capable debut\\",.

Early life  Sassolino was born in 1967 in Vicenza, Italy. He was raised in Trissino, near Vicenza, in the north-east of Italy. In his 20s, he created a three-dimensional puzzle game recalling the Rubik's Cube, and was hired by Robert Fuhrer and Nextoy, LLC, representatives of Casio Creative Products, for which worked for 6 years in New York, inventing and developing original and innovative toys and games. In 1996 Sassolino went back to Italy, where he worked on marble sculpture in Pietrasanta.  Artistic Path  In Sassolino's works the spectators find themselves in front of well known industrial materials, such as stainless steel, glass or concrete. He uses these materials into mechanical/thermodynamical fantastic machines, that make the elements reach their limits: extreme speed, friction, gravity, heat, pressure. Sassolino's sculptures are inorganic performances in which machines take life, get broken by contrast and conflict of forces, on the verge of a breakdown (which is a fundamental aspect of his work). He works around concepts such caducity, loss, unpredictability, danger, failure.

In the book, Kamin examines empirical evidence regarding IQ, a common measure of human intelligence, and concludes that there is no evidence that it is significantly heritable. As part of the book's broader critique of hereditarianism and psychometrics, Kamin also became the first to accuse Cyril Burt of scientific misconduct in his twin research. In the book, Kamin states one of its principal conclusions thus: \\"There exist no data which should lead a prudent man to accept the hypothesis that IQ test scores are in any degree heritable.\\" Reviews The psychologist Asa Grant Hilliard III reviewed the book favorably, describing it as \\"thoughtful and meticulously documented\\" and as \\"a book of profound importance for the contemporary social and professional scene.\\" In another favorable review, Raymond Lorion concluded that the book was \\"...a unique and important contribution to timely consideration of the nature-nurture issue.\\" Peter Medawar wrote in the New York Review of Books that \\"...Kamin's interpretation of the origins of hereditarian theory has about it the kind of Olympian glibness more often found in psychoanalytic theory, and it is equally difficult to refute.\\" Medawar also praised Kamin for \\"...his nice touch for allowing the subjects of his criticism to assassinate themselves.\\" David Layzer reviewed the book favorably in Scientific American, writing that \\"Kamin has made a strong negative case. He has gone back to the primary sources and demonstrated with a wealth of circumstantial detail that the data they contain cannot support the interpretation that Burt, Jensen and other hereditarians have placed on them.\\" Other reviews of the book were more mixed. The psychologist Nicholas Mackintosh wrote that \\"Whatever reservations one may have about the validity of his many arguments...Kamin has performed a notable service by subjecting the evidence on the heritability of intelligence to searching and critical analysis.\\" Economist John Conlisk commended the book for discussing a \\"broad range of issues\\" and for paying close attention to the original data, while also criticizing it for its environmentalist bias. Similarly, behavior geneticist David W. Fulker commended the book for cataloging examples of misrepresentation of IQ test scores, while also criticizing its description of research into the heritability of IQ. Writing in Social Research, psychologist Franz Samelson stated that while he agreed with the book's conclusion regarding the flaws of research on the supposed genetic basis of IQ, he found Kamin's \\"historical account\\" of IQ testing presented in the book to be \\"grossly oversimplified\\". Douglas N. Jackson criticized the book's portrayal of the developers of IQ tests, which he claimed was unfairly negative: \\"...the author's collection of historical quotations by no means represents a random sample of the views of psychologists of the past or of today...It does not follow that because some historical advocates of the heritability of IQ have espoused illiberal views and policies all have such views.\\" References 1974 non-fiction books Books about human intelligence Books by Leon Kamin English-language books ","title":"The Science and Politics of I.Q."},{"id":"55946898","text":"Johan Peter Lundgren (born 4 October 1966)Companies House is a Swedish businessman, the chief executive officer of the British airline easyJet since December 2017.

Name The older tribal autonym was Ngarabana, which may have been misheard by white settlers as Arabana, the term now generally accepted by new generations of the Ngarabana. Language Arabana, like Wangganguru with which it shares a 90% overlap in vocabulary, is a member of the Karnic subgroup of the Pama-Nyungan language. Country In Norman Tindale's estimation, the Arabana controlled some of tribal land. They were present at the Neales River to the west of Lake Eyre, and west as far as the Stuart Range; Macumba Creek. Southwards their lands extended to Coward Springs. Their terrain also took in Oodnadatta, Lora Creek and Lake Cadibarrawirracanna. The neighbouring tribes were the Kokata to the west, with the frontier between the two marked by the scarp of the western tableland near Coober Pedy. To their east were the Wangkanguru. Mythology Several traditional stories are well documented, especially that regarding a man- eating Buzzard and his Eaglehawk mate. The chief protagonists are three animals: (1) Wantu Wantu, the man-eating Black-breasted Buzzard; (2) Irritye or Irretye, a friendly Wedge-tailed Eagle; and (3) Kutta Kutta(variantly called Akwete Akwete) who, though described as a small hawk is actually the Spotted nightjar. History of Contact The Arabana were visited by Baldwin Spencer and Francis James Gillen in 1903 for a specific purpose. Their earlier work had argued that the truly 'primitive' nature of the Arrernte was indicated by the fact that their totemic identities came from the spirit responsible for making individuals’ mothers pregnant. James Frazer adopted this to buttress his theories on the development phases of 'primitive societies’. A Scottish amateur ethnographer Andrew Lang contested their interpretations of the Arrernte, arguing that they were not ‘primitive’, a label he argued was more appropriate to their near neighbours the Arabana, who traced descent through the mother and linked their totemic system to exogamy. It was to address this challenge that accounted for Spencer and Gillen’s return to Arabana lands, whose elders they interviewing Old Peake Station and Thantyiwanparda in the nearby gidgee scrub.

Basic premise Like Poul Anderson's Time Patrol, the ARC Riders are an elite time traveling force, totally dedicated to preserving history as it is, preventing (or reversing) any attempt by \\"Revisionist\\" time- travelers to change it, and severely punishing any such Revisionists which they catch. (\\"ARC\\" stands for \\"Anti-Revision Command\\"). ARC Riders was followed by a sequel, The Fourth Rome, in 1996. Plot summary The protagonist ARC Riders return from a routine mission to their 23rd Century base, to find that somebody had interfered with history. Their home base - and the entire world - are dominated by highly belligerent Orientals. They barely manage to escape, and head back to the 20th Century to locate and reverse the interference, and restore history to what it should have been. They discover that the change of history was due to the misguided efforts of a 23rd Century American nationalist. By his time, the United States had diminished to a backward, second-rate country with no influence on the global level. Seeking the reasons for the American decline, he came to the conclusion that the turning point was the Americans' failure to launch a ground invasion of North Vietnam in 1969, and that such an invasion would have enabled the US to win the Vietnam War and retain its status as the dominant world power. Obtaining a time machine he proceeds to go back to 1968, engineer a coup d'etat and have the cabal of American generals duly launch the invasion; there was no election in 1968 or any time later, with President Lyndon Johnson retained by the generals as a figurehead with no real power. However, the results were far from what the would-be savior from the future expected. When the ARC Riders emerge in a changed 1991 they find the Vietnam War still going on, further than ever from resolution. Though the whole of North Vietnam was long since occupied by American troops, the war continues unabated in central China. After decades of harsh military rule and all civil rights stamped out, the US is on the verge of collapse and a nuclear civil war. President Johnson is still kept alive by constant medical attention, with no real power and little knowledge of the acts perpetrated by generals and secret policemen in his name. The ARC Riders discover the interloper from the future responsible for all this, commanding a motley force of half-criminal anti-Communist militia in occupied North Vietnam - a scene reminiscent of Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\". Having long since come to realize the folly of what he had done, he is happy to help the agents reverse it and restore the original timeline - even though as a \\"Revisionist\\" he can expect a harsh punishment.

This led to the postponement of local government elections in the county by 12 months. The changes were confirmed by the Isle of Anglesey (Electoral Arrangements) Order 2012 in October 2012. The changes were based on proposals by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales, after a review was ordered by the Welsh Government's Minister for Social Justice and Local Government, Carl Sargeant, in March 2012. The Commission proposed replacing the 40 electoral wards, which had elected one county councillor each, with eleven multi-member wards electing 30 county councillors in total. This was ostensibly to bring the ratio of councillors closer to 1:1750 of the voting population. The proposals were revealed by the Boundary Commission in May 2012. Despite strongly opposing the changes, Anglesey County Council voted by a majority on 27 June to accept the proposals and, in September, the Wales Government agreed to enshrine them in law. As a result of the changes, Sargeant announced in January 2012 that the county council election which was due to take place in May 2012 (at the same time as other United Kingdom local government votes) would not take place until May 2013.

Throughout his stay there, the Cameroonian scored many goals for the club, including five in the 2009 AFC Cup and a hat-trick in a 4-0 win over Preah Khan Reach in the 2009 Hun Sen Cup semifinal. However, a late winner in the 90th minute opposing Khemara Keila was disallowed due to the referee's decision to mark it a offside. Expressing gratefulness to coach Chay Sichoeun and Phnom Penh Crown's staff as well as their fans, Lappe-Lappe moved to Okkthar United of the Myanmar National League in 2010, seeking a higher salary.

Since 2011 he has been the parliamentary correspondent, based in Ottawa, for the online, left- of-centre Canadian newsmagazine rabble.ca.  Filmmaking Nerenberg wrote, produced and co-directed (with Malcolm Hamilton) the feature-length documentary film Never Come Back, about the Roma (sometimes called Gypsy) communities of Canada and central Europe. Never Come Back was first broadcast by OMNI television in Canada, subsequently by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s ‘documentary’ network, and presented at a number of festivals worldwide. In 2013, Never Come Back received the award for best documentary from the Canadian Ethnic Media Association. Nerenberg also co-directed and wrote the feature-length documentary And Who Are You? which profiled four Canadians of Polish origin, two Jews and two Gentiles, as they travelled to Poland to explore their roots.  Broadcasting  From 1977 to 2000, Nerenberg worked in a number of capacities at both the English and French networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In 1990, the CBC English network weekly television program On the Road Again, of which he was executive producer, won the Gemini award for best light information series. In 1986, for the CBC French network television program Le Point, Nerenberg produced a report that exposed flaws in the Canadian airport security system. From 1992 to 2000 Nerenberg was senior editor of the CBC English radio network’s weekly show on federal politics, The House.  NGO work  Nerenberg also worked in the non-governmental sector, notably for the Canadian-based international organization the Forum of Federations, where he directed communications and worked on peace building in Sri Lanka. While at Forum, he co-edited the Handbook on Federal Countries, published by McGill-Queen’s University Press.  Notable work  In 2013, Nerenberg reported on an apology broadcaster Ezra Levant issued for derogatory comments he had made, on-air, about the Roma people. Nerenberg had earlier reported on Levant’s controversial television report \\"The Jew Versus the Gypsies\\", a broadcast that resulted in a Toronto Police and Ontario Attorney General hate crime investigation. In his story, Nerenberg pointed out a number of ways in which Levant's broadcast appeared to have violated the hate crimes provision of Canada's criminal code.  Awards  Nerenberg has won a number of awards for his work, including a Golden Sheaf from the Yorkton (Saskatchewan) film and television festival for a Canada Day special for CBC English language television entitled \\"Journey to Bacon Cove\\", and the 1985 award for best international reportage from the Communauté des televisions francophones (French language television community), for a series of reports on Apartheid era South Africa entitled \\"l’Afrique du sud: quatre portraits\\" broadcast on the CBC French network daily television program Le Point. Nerenberg appears regularly on such radio shows as The Sheldon MacLeod Show on News 95.7 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. His work for rabble.ca has been republished frequently by the Canadian news aggregator National Newswatch and a number of his articles for rabble.ca were collected into a book, Harper vs. Canada: Five Ways of Looking at the Conservative Regime.  Personal life  Nerenberg graduated from McGill University (1971). He is married and is an enthusiastic amateur jazz pianist.

The car and rocket are products of Tesla and SpaceX, respectively, both companies headed by Elon Musk. The 2008-model Roadster is personally owned by and previously used by Musk for commuting to work. It is the first production car launched into space and first to orbit the sun. The car, mounted on the rocket's second stage, acquired enough velocity to escape Earth's gravity and enter an elliptical heliocentric orbit crossing the orbit of Mars. The orbit reaches a maximum distance from the Sun at aphelion of . During the early portion of the voyage outside the Earth's atmosphere, live video was transmitted back to the mission control center and live-streamed for slightly over four hours. Advertising analysts noted Musk's sense of brand management and use of new media for his decision to launch a Tesla into space. While some commenters voiced concern that the car contributed to space debris, others saw it as a work of art. Musk explained he wanted to inspire the public about the \\"possibility of something new happening in space\\" as part of his larger vision for spreading humanity to other planets.  Background  alt=Photograph of a parking space with the words \\"SpaceX\\" and \\"reserved\\". The parking space contains a red convertible sports car with Californian license plate TSLA 10. On the rear of the vehicle are written the words \\"Tesla Roadster Sport\\". In March 2017, SpaceX's founder, Elon Musk, said that because the launch of the new Falcon Heavy vehicle was risky, it would carry the \\"silliest thing we can imagine\\". In June 2017, one of his Twitter followers suggested that the silly thing be a Tesla Model S, to which Musk replied \\"Suggestions welcome!\\". In December 2017 he announced that the payload would be his personal \\"midnight cherry Tesla Roadster\\". Later that month, photos of the car prior to payload encapsulation were released. One of the test flight objectives was to demonstrate that the new rocket could carry a payload as far as the orbit of Mars. NASA had declined SpaceX's offer to carry a scientific payload. Following the successful launch, the Roadster became the first standard roadworthy vehicle sent into space, though several special-purpose lunar and Mars rovers had previously been launched. = Roadster as payload = alt=Illustration of Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster attached to the upper stage of a Falcon rocket, with a driver wearing a white- and-black spacesuit in the driving seat and the Earth visible in the background.

Hanneke Weitering, Space.com. February 5, 2018. It was placed with the right hand on the steering wheel and the left elbow resting on the open window sill. The mannequin was named after the David Bowie song \\"Starman\\", and the car's sound system was set before launch to continuously loop the Bowie song \\"Space Oddity\\". There is a copy of Douglas Adams' novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in the glovebox, along with references to the book in the form of a towel and a sign on the dashboard that reads \\"DON'T PANIC!\\". A Hot Wheels miniature Roadster with a miniature Starman is mounted on the dashboard. A plaque bearing the names of the employees who worked on the project is placed underneath the car, and a message on the vehicle's circuit board reads \\"Made on Earth by humans\\". The car also carries a copy of Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy on a 5D optical disc, a proof of concept for high-density long-lasting data storage, donated to Musk by the Arch Mission Foundation.

Its alt=Diagram of the inner solar system with the circular orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars going around the Sun. The orbit of the Tesla Roadster is shown in red, also encircling the Sun, but in an ellipse shape that touches Earth orbit on one side of the Sun, and extends outwards beyond Mars orbit on the other side of the Sun. The US Office of Commercial Space Transportation issued the test flight's launch license on February 2, 2018. The rocket lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center at 15:45 EST (20:45 UTC) on February 6. The upper stage supporting the car was initially placed in an Earth parking orbit. It spent six hours coasting through the Van Allen radiation belts, thereby demonstrating a new capability requested by the U.S. Air Force for direct insertion of heavy intelligence satellites into geostationary orbit. Then, the upper stage performed a second boost to reach the desired escape trajectory. The launch was live streamed, and video feeds from space showed the Roadster at various angles, with Earth in the background, thanks to cameras placed inside and outside the car, on booms attached to the vehicle's custom adaptor atop the upper stage. Musk had estimated the car's battery would last over 12 hours, but the live stream ran for just over four hours, thus ending before the final boost out of Earth orbit. The images were released by SpaceX into the public domain on their Flickr account. Following the launch, the rocket stage carrying the car was given the Satellite Catalog Number 43205, named \\"TESLA ROADSTER/FALCON 9H\\", along with the COSPAR designation 2018-017A. The JPL Horizons system publishes solutions for the trajectory as target body \\"-143205\\". The Roadster is in a heliocentric orbit that crosses the orbit of Mars and reaches a distance of from the Sun. With an inclination of roughly 1 degree to the ecliptic plane, compared to Mars' 1.85° inclination, this trajectory by design cannot intercept Mars, so the car will neither fly by Mars nor enter an orbit around Mars. This was the second object launched by SpaceX to leave Earth orbit, after the DSCOVR mission to the Earth–Sun Lagrangian point. Nine months after launch, the Tesla had travelled beyond the orbit of Mars, reaching aphelion at 12:48 UTC on November 9, 2018, at a distance of from the Sun. The maximum speed of the car relative to the Sun will be at perihelion. Select \\"Aug 15, 2019 Closest to the Sun (perihelion)\\" in the \\"Past and future events\\" section to view the predicted speed at that time. Even if the rocket had targeted an actual Mars transfer orbit, the car could not have been placed into orbit around Mars, because the upper stage that carries it is not equipped with the necessary propellant, maneuvering, and communications capabilities. This flight simply demonstrated that Falcon Heavy is capable of launching significant payloads towards Mars in potential future missions. Cultural impact The car in space quickly became a topic for Internet memes. Western Australia Police distributed a picture of a radar gun aimed at the Roadster whilst above Australia. Škoda produced a parody video of a Škoda Superb being driven to Mars (a village in central France). An attempt was made by Donut Media to launch a Hot Wheels Tesla Model X to the stratosphere using a weather balloon. ToSky, a Siberian start-up, sent a scale model of a Soviet-era Lada carrying a mannequin of Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin to an altitude of 20 km to gather test data for the design of stratostats. Some news reports observed a similarity between the real pictures of a car orbiting the Earth and the title sequence of the 1981 animation film Heavy Metal, where a space traveler lands on Earth in a two-seater Chevrolet Corvette convertible. The SpaceX launch live stream reached over 2.3 million concurrent viewers on YouTube, which made it the second most watched live event on the platform, behind another space-related event: Felix Baumgartner's jump from the stratosphere in 2012.  Reactions  The choice of the Roadster as a dummy payload was variously interpreted as marketing for Tesla, a work of art, or a contribution to space debris. = Marketing = Musk was lauded as a visionary marketer and brand manager by controlling both the timing and the content of his corporate public relations. After the launch, Scientific American said using a car was not entirely pointless, in the sense that something of that size and weight was necessary for a meaningful test. \\"Thematically, it was a perfect fit\\" to use the Tesla car, and there was no reason not to take the opportunity to remind the auto industry that Musk was challenging the status quo in that arena, as well as in space. Advertising Age agreed with Business Insider that the Roadster space launch was the \\"greatest ever car commercial without a dime spent on advertising\\", demonstrating that Musk is \\"miles ahead of the rest\\" in reaching young consumers, where \\"mere mortals scrabble about spending millions to fight each other over seconds of air time\\", Musk \\"just executes his vision.\\" Alex Hern, technology reporter for The Guardian, said the choice to launch a car was a \\"hybrid of genuine breakthrough and nerd-baiting publicity stunt\\" without \\"any real point beyond generating good press pics\\", which should not detract from the much more important technological milestone represented by the launch of the rocket itself. Lori Garver, a former NASA deputy director, initially said the choice of payload for the Falcon Heavy maiden flight is a gimmick and a loss of opportunity to further advance science—but later clarified that \\"I was told by a SpaceX VP (vice president) at the launch that they offered free launches to NASA, Air Force etc. but got no takers.\\" Musk responded to the critics explaining he wanted to inspire the public about the \\"possibility of something new happening in space,\\" as part of his larger vision for spreading humanity to other planets. = Work of art = alt=Large circular disc of a fully- illuminated planet Earth floating in the blackness of space. In front of Earth is a red convertible sports-car seen from the side. A humanoid figure wearing a white-and-black spacesuit is seated in the driving seat with the right-arm holding the steering wheel, and the left-arm resting on the top of the car door. The Verge likened the Roadster to a \\"Readymade\\" work of art, such as Marcel Duchamp's 1917 piece Fountain, created by placing an everyday object in an unusual position, context and orientation. Alice Gorman, a lecturer in archaeology and space studies at Flinders University in Australia, said that the Roadster's primary purpose is symbolic communication, that \\"the red sports car symbolises masculinity – power, wealth and speedTesla Roadster gets Interplanetary ID. Leonard David. Space. 9 February 2018. – but also how fragile masculinity is.\\" Drawing on anthropological theories of symbols, she argues that \\"The car is also an armour against dying, a talisman that quells a profound fear of mortality.\\" Gorman wrote that \\"the spacesuit is also about death. [...] The Starman was never alive, but now he's haunting space.\\" = Space debris = Orbital debris expert Darren McKnight stated that the car poses no risk because it is far from Earth orbit. He added: \\"The enthusiasm and interest that [Musk] generates more than offsets the infinitesimally small 'littering' of the cosmos.\\"Is the Tesla Roadster Flying on the Falcon Heavy's Maiden Flight Just Space Junk?. Leonard David, Space, 5 February 2018. Tommy Sanford, director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, said that the car and its rocket stage are no more \\"space junk\\" than the mundane material usually launched on other test flights. Mass simulators are often deliberately placed in a graveyard orbit or sent on a deep space trajectory, where they are not a hazard. Hugh Lewis, an expert in space debris at the University of Southampton, tweeted \\"Intentionally launching a car to a long-lived orbit is not what you want to hear from a company planning to fly 1000s satellites in LEO.\\"What you need to know about SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launch. Conor Dillon, Deutsche Welle – Science. 6 February 2018. The Planetary Society was concerned that launching a non-sterile object to interplanetary space may risk biological contamination of a foreign world.Let's talk about Elon Musk launching his Tesla into space. Jason Davis, The Planetary Society. 5 February 2018. Scientists at Purdue University thought it was the \\"dirtiest\\" man-made object ever sent into space, in terms of bacteria amount, noting the car was previously driven on Los Angeles freeways. Although the vehicle will be sterilized by solar radiation over time, some bacteria might survive on pieces of plastic which could contaminate Mars in the distant future.  Orbit tracking  The car and the upper stage were passivated by intentionally removing remaining chemical and electrical energy, at which point they ceased transmitting telemetry. Based on optical observations made using a robotic telescope at the Warrumbungle Observatory, Dubbo, Australia and refinement of the orbit, a close re-encounter with Earth (originally predicted for 2073) is not possible. In October 2020, the car will make its closest approach to Mars, about away, well outside the planet's gravitational sphere of influence.Elon Musk's Tesla overshot Mars' orbit, but it won't reach the asteroid belt as claimed. Loren Grush, The Verge. 8 February 2018. The Virtual Telescope Project observed the Tesla two days after its launch, where it had a magnitude of 15.5, comparable to Pluto's moon Charon. The Roadster was automatically spotted and logged by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope operated by the University of Hawaii. The car was observed by the Deimos Sky Survey (DeSS) at a distance of with a flashing effect suggesting spinning. Through measuring changes in apparent brightness of the object, astronomers have determined that the Roadster is rotating with a period of 4.7589 ± 0.0060 minutes (i.e. 4 minutes, 46 seconds). By February 11, 2018, astrometry measurements from 241 independent observations had been collated, refining the positions to within one-tenth of an arcsecond and published by the SeeSat-L mailing list, a group of amateur satellite spotters—more accurate than for most observations of objects in space. = Future predictions = Simulations over a 3-million-year timespan found a probability of the Roadster colliding with Earth at approximately 6%, or with Venus at approximately 2.5%. These probabilities of collision are similar to those of other near-Earth objects. The half-life for the tested orbits was calculated as approximately 20 million years, but with trajectories varying significantly following a close approach to the Earth–Moon system in 2091. Musk had originally speculated that the car could drift in space for a billion years. According to chemist William Carroll, solar radiation, cosmic radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts will structurally damage the car over time. Radiation will eventually break down any material with carbon–carbon bonds, including carbon fiber parts. Tires, paint, plastic and leather might last only about a year, while carbon fiber parts will last considerably longer. Eventually, only the aluminum frame, inert metals, and glass not shattered by meteoroids will remain. = Potential followup mission = In August 2019, as the Roadster completed its first orbit around the Sun, Musk stated that SpaceX may one day launch a small spacecraft to catch up with the Roadster and take photographs.

(Original description) The shell has a fusiform shape. It is variable in contour, colour, and development of sculpture. It contains 5½ whorls, including a two-whorled protoconch, rapidly increasing and slightly shouldered. Tne protoconch is smooth, glassy and globose. The colour of the shell is variable ; sometimes entirely drab or buff, often with the protoconch and the subsutural space darker. The example figured has a ground colour of pale cinnamon, banded or spotted with pale cream, below the suture a band of chocolate, deep within the inner lip a tinge of purple, protoconch a clear hazel-brown. The sculpture, longitudinal wave ribs sharply bent near the suture, fading away on the base, and leaving a bare space behind the aperture, wider spaced above, more crowded and irregular below. On the body whorl are fourteen, on the penultimate whorl eighteen. Both ribs and interspaces are crossed by sharp, minute, close, waved, spiral grooves. The flat-topped interspaces of these grooves, four times their width, are again cross-cut by close minute furrows into oblong beads. The aperture is narrow, three-fifths of the shell's length, fortified without by a broad but low incurving varix, which rises above the suture, enclosing a shallow sinus. A layer of callus overspreads the inner lip. The siphonal canal is short and broad.Hedley, C. 1905. Mollusca from One Hundred and Eleven Fathoms, East of Cape Byron, New South Wales.

She was also the first person to provide dental services in mental hospitals in Ontario, and towards the end of her career worked exclusively in these institutions. Background Dr. Barnabas Day organized the Dental Association of Ontario (ODA) in 1867. In 1868 the ODA lobbied the Ontario government to pass the Act Respecting Dentistry, by which the dentists must be licensed in order to practice. This aimed to end tooth pulling by untrained fly-by-night charlatans. The Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario (RCDSO) was formed by ODA members to act as the governing body. In 1869 the RCDSO opened the first dental school in Canada. The first scientific meeting of the ODA was held in 1889 in London, Ontario. By the 1890s enforcement of strict compliance with the ODA code of ethics had almost eliminated false advertising by Ontario dentists. Dentistry had become a respectable occupation in Ontario. Life Caroline Louise Josephine Irwin was born in August 1856, daughter of Charles Irwin and Catherine Tyson. On 9 March 1877, she married John Wells, a dentist. They had three children. Her husband graduated from dental school as a gold medalist in 1882 but became ill. Relatives took care of the three children while Caroline studied dentistry In 1893 C. L. Josephine Wells became the first woman to graduate from the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario, which made her the first Canadian woman to graduate from a dental school.{{sfnODA's First Female Dentist (1893) She was also the first female member of the Ontario Dental Society, as it was then called. With the support of her friends Josephine Wells attended Trinity College of the University of Toronto and received her doctorate in 1899. Josephine Wells practiced as a dentist in Toronto for 36 years. She also provided dental services at the Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Women and at mental hospitals in Toronto, Hamilton and Orillia. Daniel Clark, superintendent at the Toronto Hospital for the Insane from 1875 to 1905, began to employ a dentist for paying patients in 1898, and asked for money to also be provided to treat free patients. He saw that better dental care would improve diet and help the inmate's physical and mental wellbeing. Clark employed Josephine Wells in the early years of this program. She was the first person to provide dental services in the mental hospitals of Ontario. In the ten years before she retired she practiced exclusively in mental hospitals. Josephine Wells died on 17 March 1939. She is buried in Aurora Cemetery, Aurora, Ontario. She was followed by other female dentists, breaking the male monopoly of this profession in Ontario. The youngest of her children was the Honourable Dalton C. Wells, who became Chief Justice of the High Court of Ontario in 1966.

Born in Oregon and raised in numerous states, she became a Registered nurse, joined the United States Army Nurse Corps, and moved to Hawaii. She met Hawaii's future governor John A. Burns during a picnic at Hanauma Bay, when he was a college student. Together they had four children, one of which was born premature and died when she was struck by poliomyelitis. She never fully recovered from her paralysis, but lived a full life as a wife and mother. During her tenure as the First Lady of Hawaii, she restored the governor's residence of Washington Place. Early life and marriage She was born February 20, 1906, in Sumpter, Oregon to teachers Thomas Stanton Van Fleet and Bessie Majors. The family moved dozens of times throughout California, Oregon, and Nevada. After training as a registered nurse (RN) at the San Jose Hospital School of Nursing, she joined the United States Army Nurse Corps, and was assigned to Letterman Army Hospital in San Francisco, before being transferred to Schofield Barracks on Oahu in 1930. John A. Burns (Jack) was a student at the University of Hawaii, with a night switchboard job at the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. Their first date was a group picnic at Hanauma Bay. Afterwards they continued dating, eventually deciding to marry. He dropped out of college, and quit the newspaper to take a better-paying job with the Hawaiian Pineapple Company. They married at Schofield Barracks on June 8, 1931. When the Great Depression affected jobs at the pineapple cannery, the young couple joined her parents working on a farm in Mendocino County, California. They returned to Hawaii in 1932, with Jack working at another cannery, eventually joining the Honolulu Police Department. Their first child John Jr. (Jack Jr.) was born in 1932, followed by sister Mary Beth in 1934. Polio In 1935, Beatrice became ill with poliomyelitis during her final trimester, and delivered a premature son William who died within hours. The disease left her paralyzed. Medical practice in that era dictated that she be completely immobilized; nevertheless, she became pregnant again. Advised by her doctors to abort the fetus, she and Jack opted for alternative treatment from Seishiro Okazaki of the Nikko Sanatorium of Restoration Massage in Honolulu. Okazaki freed her from the medical splits placed on her, massaged her, and used a therapy of exercise and hot seaweed-water baths. The treatments were considered a success in that Beatrice regained use of her arms and head, and began to see overall physical improvements. However, she never regained use of her legs, and spent the rest of her life in a wheelchair. Beatrice gave birth to James Seishiro Burns (Jim) in 1937. She had not converted to Jack's Catholic faith before their marriage, but did so after the birth of Jim. Political wife At the end of World War II, Jack began his rise in politics. He quit the police force and bought the Kalama Liquor Store. Jack was often away with political involvement, and hiring employees was a financial drain on the business. Beatrice eventually ran the business herself, with her youngest son Jim pushing her home in her wheelchair in the evening. When Jack ran for a seat as Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives from Hawaii Territory in 1956, Beatrice's determination to live a normal life with polio became his political asset with a write-up titled \\"The Woman Behind the Man: The Story of Beatrice Burns\\". After his election, they lived in a Washington, D.C. apartment, where Beatrice saw less of her husband. She made his meals at home, and he took her for Sunday sight-seeing trips. The Burns children were all grown and living their individual lives in the mainland United States. She entertained political wives with small gatherings in the apartment, as her husband put his legislative efforts towards helping Hawaii achieve statehood. With the Territory of Hawaii set to become the 50th state in the union on August 21, 1959, Beatrice, like many of his colleagues in the nation's capitol, thought Jack would throw his hat in the ring for the United States Senate. Instead, he chose to pursue the office of Governor of Hawaii. When she learned of it from her eldest son, her immediate response was disbelief. Jack lost the 1959 gubernatorial election to William F. Quinn. The couple celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki. When he ran for the office a second time, Jack won the 1962 gubernatorial race in Hawaii. The week before the election, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin ran cooking recopies from the wives of candidates. Beatrice's was West Indian Shrimp Curry. She was an active First Lady of Hawaii during all three of his terms as governor, hosting diplomats and legislators, and planning her children's weddings . Unlike their family home, Beatrice managed a household staff in the governor's residence of Washington Place. The Burns moved into a decaying and termite-infested house, and she was in charge of restoring it. She had learned the value of at-home entertaining as a congressional wife. Persuaded one luncheon at a time in the run-down mansion, the legislature appropriated $50,000 for repairs. At the March 1968 National Governors Conference in Washington D. C., the wives went with Lady Bird Johnson to a planting of dogwood trees on the Potomac River. It had been raining, and temperatures were below freezing, but Beatrice rolled her chair into the mud and planted trees. As they approached Jack's third gubernatorial term in 1970, Beatrice reflected with satisfaction on her overhaul of the landscaping at Washington Place. There was one gardener and no budget to cover it. The landscaping issue was solved partially through a legislative budget appropriation, but largely through volunteers. Her request for help on the lawn and gardens was met by unpaid citizens of Hawaii who regularly worked on the gubernatorial landscaping for years. Later years and death Son Jim that she gave birth to after being paralyzed by polio became Chief Judge of Hawaii Intermediate Court of Appeals, and president of the American Judicature Society. Jack was treated for cancer during his last year in office. After George Ariyoshi won the 1974 election for governor, Beatrice and son Jim represented Jack at the inaugural. Jack died on April 5, 1975, and was buried at the National Cemetery of the Pacific. Beatrice died February 28, 1988, and was buried next to her husband.

The church falls under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the diocese of Monmouth. History Although the church dates from 1108, a religious presence is thought to have existed at the approximate location for around a century prior to this. The oldest surviving part of the building, the west doorway, dates from . The building was enlarged in 1470, when a nave, tower and chancel were added. The church unusually allowed for the wives of deceased clergymen to hold its living– a Katherine Morgan of Llanrumney Hall did so in 1603. The church was extensively refurbished in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. The churchyard is believed to have been cleared of ancient burials at some point during the mid-19th Century, as no extant stone is older than this. The church had no electricity until 1931. Having anciently been part of Monmouthshire, Rumney was transferred to the jurisdiction of Cardiff in 1937, though the church remains in the diocese of its former county.

Setting The novel is set in 1934Emilio Manzotti, Introduction to the critical edition of La cognizione del dolore (Turin: Einaudi, 1987) p.XVI. in the fictitious South American state of Maradagàl but is a thinly disguised portrait of Fascist Italy,Emilio Manzotti, Ibid., p.XII. and the landscapes are those of the Brianza area, north-west of Milan. The village of Lukones is modelled on Longone al Segrino where the Gadda family owned a villa; likewise Pastrufazio is Milan, Novokomi is Como, and Terepàttola is Lecco.Mauro Bersani, Gadda (Turin: Einaudi, 2003) p.71. Main characters The main characters are Don Gonzalo Pirobutirro d’Eltino and his mother, often described simply as “the son” and “the mother”. They live in a villa outside the town of Lukones which Gonzalo's father had had built while he and his brother were children. His father is now dead, his brother was killed in a war with the neighbouring state of Parapagàl, and he and his mother live alone in the villa, though he spends much time away in the city of Pastrufazio, where he works. Around the mother and the son we meet the local doctor, the night patrolman, the fish seller, the peon, the carpenter, the sacristan's wife, and the owner of the neighbouring castle, who provide the comic element of the novel, in contrast to the tension inside the villa. Plot summary The South American state of Maradagàl is recovering from a bitter and inconclusive war with neighbouring Parapagàl. Many ex-soldiers have found work as patrolmen in provincial associations for night vigilance (Nistitúos Provinciales de Vigilancia para la Noche). The village of Lukones is patrolled by a man known as Pedro Mahagones but an itinerant cloth trader recognizes him as Gaetano Palumbo who had fraudulently claimed a war pension on the grounds of being totally deaf. The patrolman's round includes three villas that have been struck three times by lightning. One villa had been occupied by the famous poet Carlos Caconcellos and is now said to be haunted by his ghost, but its owner has managed to rent the caretaker's lodge to Colonel Di Pascuale, a military doctor who had been responsible for unmasking Palumbo's false pension claim. Doctor Higueroa, the local doctor, receives a call from José, the peon at Villa Pirobutirro, asking him to go and visit Don Gonzalo. On his way up to the villa the doctor meets Battistina who helps out at the villa. He asks what is wrong. Battistina tells him that Señor Gonzalo wanders the house like a madman and his mother is frightened of being alone with him. The doctor arrives at the villa and is greeted by Don Gonzalo. His mother has gone to visit the cemetery. The doctor examines him. He can find nothing wrong but notes his patient's anxiety and advises him to get out more often. He proposes a short excursion by motor car. Perhaps his daughter Pina could teach him to drive. Returning outside, the son worries about his mother, who has grown old, and about his own despair which sometimes develops into violence. He worries that she sleeps in the house alone. The doctor suggests they might feel safer by joining the Nistitúo. They are interrupted by the patrolman who has come to see the Señora about signing up, but Don Gonzalo becomes impatient and sends him away. The Señora wanders alone in the house, recalling her other son who had died in the war. A storm outside forces a blast of wind through a small window. On the staircase, in the gloom, she lights a candle and sees the black outline of a scorpion. The storm passes. The Señora remains there until she hears the cats waiting to be fed and the peon's clogs upstairs on the brick floor. Gonzalo appears at the door. He barely greets his mother and goes to his room. She prepares some supper for him. The son is sitting in the dining room before a bowl of soup. His mother tries to encourage him to eat. The peon comes in to light the fire but his noise and his complaints irritate the son, who orders him out of the house, telling him not to come back. The Señora pleads but Gonzalo repeats the injunction with sudden violence. He returns to his soup. Gonzalo drinks his coffee on the terrace, then appears at the kitchen. Inside are two clogged figures, Peppa and José. There is news of a theft at the nearby castle. Its owner, Caballero Trabatta, had refused to sign up with the Nistitúo de Vigilancia despite repeated visits from its most loquacious and brilliantined propagandists. Peppa comes to visit the Señora, then Poronga the carpenter with a basket of mushrooms and a filthy dog, followed by Beppina the fishwife, carrying an enormous yellow tench dangling from a metal hook. Then Pina del Goeupp, the wife of the dwarf sacristan at the parish church. Since it is Friday, there is also the peon's 83-year-old mother. The son arrives without warning to find them in the dining room. His mother offers him coffee, but he scowls and threatens hers. He packs his suitcase and leaves. At the nearby castle, at night, two watchmen hear noises outside. They follow the sounds but find nothing. They hear a door bang inside Villa Pirobutirro. On investigation, they find the French window forced open and the house in disarray. They run down to Lukones to raise the alarm. The villagers arrive, search the house and knock at the Señora's bedroom. They push open the door and find the Señora in bed, injured and barely breathing. An unfinished novel Gadda's novel was never properly finished and remains an example of Gadda's \\"open workshop where nothing was ever quite put down or properly wrapped up\\".Tim Parks, Che pasticcio!, \\"London Review of Books\\", 20 September 2007\\". Italo Calvino described The Experience of Pain and That Awful Mess in Via Merulana as novels that \\"seem to need only a few more pages to reach their conclusions\\".Italo Calvino, Introduction to That Awful Mess in Via Merulana, 1984, translated by William Weaver. Background The villa in the novel is an exact description of the villa that Gadda's father had built in the village of Longone al Segrino around 1900, where he intended to bring up his children.Mauro Bersani, Gadda (Turin: Einaudi, 2003) p.5. But Gadda hated the place. His father had overstretched himself financially and when he died in 1909 Gadda urged his mother to sell the place, but she refused.Mauro Bersani, Ibid., p.72. His mother, Adele Lehr, was of German parentage, a severe character, and the relationship between mother and son was not an easy one. In his diary Gadda wrote: “With mother I was nasty and think I always will be, since we have too many differences on everything”.Giornale di guerre e di prigionia (Florence: Sansoni, 1955). Gadda's brother Enrico died during World War I in a plane crash, a loss from which neither Gadda nor his mother recovered.Mauro Bersani, Gadda (Turin: Einaudi, 2003) pp.7-11. Despite his conflict with his mother, he found it hard to live without her: “The picture comes back to me of her, old and helpless, and above all the indescribable feelings I have of remorse at my outbursts, so pointless and vile. I suffered too much and was not in control of myself, but my anguish nevertheless is now very great.\\" Letter of 27 December 1936, in Lettere a una gentile signora (Milan: Adelphi, 1983). He sold the villa soon after his mother's death: “This year I’ve managed to sell off my tottering estate at Longone, Brianza, making an appalling deal, but freeing myself of the feudal obsession”Letter to Lucia Rodocanachi, 12 September 1937, in Mauro Bersani, Gadda (Turin: Einaudi, 2003) p.64. Publication history He began work on this novel shortly after his mother's death on 4 April 1936.Emilio Manzotti, Introduction to the critical edition of La cognizione del dolore (Turin: Einaudi, 1987) p. LX. The first seven chapters appeared in instalments between 1938 and 1941 in Letteratura, a Florentine literary journal. These chapters were published together for the first time by Garzanti in 1963, but without the two final chapters, which had been written around the same time as the first seven chapters. The novel appeared in what would be its definitive form in 1970.Mauro Bersani, Gadda (Turin: Einaudi, 2003) p.72.

He conducted the choir Kantorei Barmen-Gemarke and he is artistic director of the Kettwiger Bach-Ensemble.  Career  Born in Dortmund, Kläsener studied organ with Gisbert Schneider from 1979 and Catholic church music at the Folkwang-Hochschule from 1981, graduating in 1987. As an organist, he was recipient of the third prize at the Internationaler Johann- Sebastian-Bach-Wettbewerb in Leipzig in 1988, and of the Walter Gieseking Competition in Saarbrücken in 1989. He took a concert exam with Daniel Roth in 1990. Kläsener founded in 1984 the Kettwiger Bach-Ensemble, a chamber ensemble which received several prizes at international competitions. Besides a cappella music from all periods, they try unconventional programming. In October 2017, they performed a program for the Year of the Reformation which combined the last premiere of a work by Thomas Beimel, im anfang war das wort, with Bach's Lutherische Messe in G major and Bruckner's Mass in E minor. The composer had intended the work, based on the prologue of the Book of John, to be performed by the ensemble for his 50th birthday. He had collaborated in rehearsals, but suddenly died. The concert was held in his memory. From 1985, Kläsener was lecturer of organ and choral conducting at the Bischöfliche Kirchenmusikschule in Essen, and from 1990 lecturer of choral conducting at the Kirchenmusikschule in Rottenburg am Neckar. From 1993, he was artistic director of the Kantorei Barmen-Gemarke. He prepared the Kantorei for performances of Bach's St Matthew Passion in a danced version in 2017, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the relationship between Wuppertal and Beer-Sheva, Israel. The music was shortened and in different order, to match the retrospect narrative of the choreographer Tamir Ginz of the dance company Kamea. The production was shown in Leverkusen, in the Opernhaus Wuppertal, and in Beer-Sheva. Kläsener conducted the Kantorei Barmen-Gemarke to July 2017, and took up a new position as the church musician in Solingen's West from 9 September 2017.

Notable buildings in the vicinity include Museum of Vojvodina, Youth Theatre, Vojvodina's Museum of the contemporary arts, Museum of Novi Sad and Archive of Vojvodina.  Name  The name of the park, Dunavski park, means the Danube park. However, though near the river, the park was named after the (\\"Danube Street\\"), which encircles it on the north.  History  = Origin = Swans Isa and Bisa The Nymph In the 19th century, the area of modern park was an arm of the Danube, or liman. Neighborhood south of the park, and former municipality of Novi Sad, is called Liman today. The area was a proper, large bog, known for the abundance of reeds, willows, mosquitos and frogs. Additionally, the entire locality was lower than the surrounding land, as the earth was dug and used for the construction of the embankment on the Danube's left bank (Mostobran), across the Petrovaradin Fortress. Some paintings from the period show boats navigating through the bog. = Park = In 1895 it was decided that a park will be formed instead of a bog. The muddy and sandy watery depression was covered with earth, leaving a small body of water which was bricked and turned into a lake. A small island remained in the lake. It was named Eržebet, after the Empress Elisabeth of Austria, empress consort of Austria-Hungary. When she was assassinated in 1898, a weeping willow was planted in her honor on the island. The lake was formed on an altitude of . The lake and the island are today simply called Jezero and Ostrvce, meaning \\"lake\\" and \\"islet\\". Photographs from 1900 show people skating on the lake. The thorough arrangement of the park began in the early 1900s. The kafana Kod engleske kraljice (\\"Chez Queen of England\\") was demolished and a building of the court was built, which today hosts the Museum of Vojvodina. The grass was planted, so as new trees and the earth pathways were placed throughout the park. First sculpture, the Nymph (officially, The girl with a cornucopia, work of Đorđe Jovanović), was erected in 1912. The park was further arranged in the 1920s and 1930s. The park was originally named Promenada. In the mid-1930s the filling of the swamp was finally completed, so as the completion of the pathways and the park was renamed to Danube Park. The park was refurbished from 1958 to 1962, on the project of Ratibor Đorđević, when it was shaped in the form in which it exists today. All the sick and dried trees were removed and flower arrangements were introduced. Another major reconstruction occurred in 1978.  Wildlife  = Plant life = There are over 600 individual trees and 7,000 decorative plants in the park, with 250 different plant species. Deciduous trees include plane trees (as of 2017, some are over 100 years old), Lombardy poplar, silver linden, European nettle tree, hazelnut, birch, maple, horse-chestnut and penduculate oak, which is under protection, while evergreen trees are black pine, thuja, cypress, fir. Decorative plants include white poplar, pond cypress, cherry plum, Turkish hazel, pyramidal oak and numerous shrubs (common box, Maule's quince, common barberry, European cornel). The vegetation in park is exceptionally lush compared to the other parks in Serbia and it is not known why the trees and plants thrive more than in other similar places. The flowers, like Aztec marigold or African arrowroot last long into the autumn. The ground is wet, so one of the possible explanations is the closeness of the Danube and a fact that the land used to be a swamp. = Animal life = The lake is mostly inhabited by ducks. For a long time, a symbol of the park was a couple of swans, called Isa and Bisa. Their offspring were attacked in 2015 by the red-eared sliders, which were probably released in the lake by their owners who kept them as pets. One chick was killed and two others had their wings bitten off, one wing each. However, some experts thought that the turtles couldn't do that. Still, the lake was emptied, all sliders were removed and transferred to the Lake Palić, and only the European pond turtles which are harmless for the birds, were kept.  Characteristics  The park covers an area of , of which green area occupy . Apart from the Nymph, there are several other sculptures in the park. Busts of poets Branko Radičević (by Ivanka Acin; 1953) and Miroslav Antić (by Pavle Radovanović; 1992), bronze monument to poet and painter Đura Jakšić (by Jovan Soldatović; 1990) and a monument to the Venerable Sergius of Radonezh (by Vyacheslav Kulikov; 1992). There was another sculpture by Soldatović in the park, the \\"Roe deer\\", but it was transferred to the military complex and hunting ground of Karađorđevo later. There are also a drinking fountain and the small fountain. A white gazebo (saletla) was constructed in the park. It hosts the smaller concerts and shows, literary evenings and exhibitions. Almost all newlyweds have photo sessions in the park and in front of the gazebo. In 1998, government of the Republic of Serbia declared the Danube Park a natural monument of the II category and placed it under protection.

There is an inscription commemorating the refortification of Qanīʾ from February 530 or 531 by a Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ and his sons Shuriḥbiʾīl Yakmul and Maʿdīkarib Yaʿfur. He was the son of Laḥayʿat Yarkham, from western Ḥimyar and had been in exile in Aksum, only returning with the Aksumite invasion force. It is not certain that this was the same Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ who was or became king of Ḥimyar. It is not possible to be precise about the date of accession of Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ. A native Ḥimyarite and a Christian, he was appointed by the Aksumite king Caleb, who had defeated and killed the previous king of Ḥimyar, Dhū Nuwās, sometime between Pentecost 525 and February 531. A fragmentary inscription appears to give his full title as \\"king of Sabaʾ, of dhu-Raydān, of Ḥaḍramawt, and of Yamnat, and of their Arabs of the Upper Country and of the Coast\\". The text records the founding of a building, probably a church. After his victory, Caleb returned to Aksum but left part of his army behind as a garrison. The Roman emperor Justinian I sent two embassies to Ḥimyar during the brief reign of Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ. Sometime between April and September 531, he sent an embassy to the court of Aksum and to Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ, hoping for an alliance against Persia and for Ḥimyarite aid to the Roman ally Qays ibn Salama ibn al-Ḥārith. The Roman historian Procopius details the embassy of the ambassador Julian: > At that time, when Hellesthaeus [Caleb] was reigning over the Aethiopians > [Aksumites], and Esimiphaeus over the Homeritae [Ḥimyarites], the Emperor > Justinian sent an ambassador, Julianus, demanding that both nations on > account of their community of religion should make common cause with the > Romans in the war against the Persians. . . As for the Homeritae, it was > desired that they should establish Caïsus [Qays], the fugitive, as captain > over the Maddeni [Maʿadd], and with a great army of their own people and of > the Maddene Saracens make an invasion into the land of the Persians. This > Caïsus was by birth of the captain’s rank and an exceptionally able warrior, > but he had killed one of the relatives of Esimiphaeus and was a fugitive in > a land which is so utterly destitute of human habitation. So each king, > promising to put this demand into effect, dismissed the ambassador, but > neither one of them did the things agreed upon by them. A little later Nonnosos was sent on a mission to Kinda and Aksum, but \\"in addition to these goals [he was] to visit the Ameritae\\", that is, the Ḥimyarites. In 535, ʾAbreha, the commander of the Aksumite forces in Ḥimyar, revolted and overthrew Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ, who was imprisoned in a fortress. Caleb sent two further military expeditions to restore Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ, but both ended in failure. The details of these events are found in Procopius. In the 540s, when ʾAbreha had inscriptions added to the Maʾrib Dam to commemorate its repair, he noted his victory over a son of Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ. The Aryāṭ of later Islamic accounts may be based on Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ. Later Christian historiography generally omitted Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ in order not exposed ʾAbreha—a Christian hero in these accounts—as a usurper. This often extended to falsely lengthening the reign of ʾAbreha to include that of his predecessor. Thus, Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ is not mentioned in the Martyrion of Arethas, the Bios of Gregentios, the Chronographia of Theophanes of Byzantium or the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian. On the basis of the Laws of the Ḥimyarites, part of the Bios of Gregentios, Irfan Shahîd argued that Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ took the throne name Abraham, causing confusion between him and his successor because of the similarity of their names.

A peer of the famed Moses Sofer of Pressburg, Koppel Charif presided over what was at one time the largest and most prestigious yeshiva in Hungary.  Early years  Reb Koppel Charif was born in the city of Altenkunshtadt, state of Bayern [Baveria], Germany in 1765. (5526 on the Hebrew calendar). His father was the scholar Reb Tzvi Hirsh Altenkunshtadt. The family had resided in Altenkunshtadt for numerous generations. At the age of 10, Reb Tzvi Hirsh Altenkunshtadt sent his son to study in the yeshivah of the Gaon Rebbi Yoseph Shteinhart z”l, author of Responsa Zichron Yoseph, who led the community of Fiurda [Fürth]. After Shteinhart passed away, one year after Reb Koppel Charif's arrival, Reb Koppel Charif continued his studies under Gaon Rebbi Hirsh. In 1781 (Jewish year 5542) Reb Koppel Charif went to study under Yechezkel Landau of Prague, author of Noda biYehudah, where he soon attained the reputation of being the sharpest of all Rebbi Yechezkel Landau’s students and was awarded the title of meshuchrar (lit. free, unrestricted). The title indicated a student who had achieved full independence in scholarship and was free to attend or not attend classes as he wished. The only other student of the Gaon Noda biYehudah who earned this title was Reb Koppel Charif’s colleague, Rebbi Elyokim Götz Schwerin. During his time in Fiurda, Reb Koppel Charif's parents passed away. He lived in Prague for four years from 1783 to 1786 (Jewish years 5544 to 5547), till the age of twenty-one. In 1786 (Jewish year 5547) he became engaged to Raizel Pessels, the daughter of the scholar and merchant R’ Avrohom Pessels of Shtampfen, Hungary. As the marriage was delayed for more than a year, he studied in Pressburg at the yeshivah of the Gaon Rebbi Meir beReb Shaul, known as the Mahara”m beRebbi, Av Beis Din of Pressburg. The marriage finally took place in 1788 (Jewish year 5549). He studied in Shtampfen for a few months until he was appointed the rabbi in Karlburg which he served from 1789 until 1791 (Jewish years 5550 until 5552) at which time he was chosen to be rabbi of Verbau, Hungary.  Verbau  Beginning of eulogy of Koppel Charif by Moshe Sofer Reb Koppel Charif served as rabbi of Verbau for 45 years. He was well loved by the community and known for his humility, kindness, and accessibility. His life in Verbau was pleasant and tranquil and through him the city became famous for Torah scholarship. His yeshivah usually held about 150 students, which amounted to thousands over the decades. The yeshiva produced many scholars including Rebbi Osher Anshel HaLevi Yungreiz, author of the sefer Menuchas Osher, Rebbi Meir Eizenshtadt, Av Beis Din of Ungvar, author of Imrei A”sh, and Rebbi Itzok Aharon Landemberg. Reb Koppel Charif died 19 December 1837 (21st Kislev 5598) and was eulogized by the Chasom Sofer who had exchanged letters with him for several years. The eulogy appears in Moshe Sofer's commentary on Chumash, Toras Moshe, in parshas Vayechi. In his humility, Reb Koppel Charif did not publish his Torah or Talmudic commentary or halachic rulings. However, he sons did assemble manuscripts most of which were destroyed in a fire many years after his passing. Only his chiddushim on tractate Chullin were printed some months after his passing, by the name of Chiddushei Yaavetz on massechess Chullin. Moses Sofer wrote an approbation to that sefer. Also surviving the fire were novellae on tractate Gittin, on the three Bovos Bovo Kamo, Bovo Metzia, Bovo Basro], and on various discourses on the Talmud.  References  * C.

It contains a single species, A. tenerensis, named in 2017 by Paul Sereno from parts of the right leg, vertebrae, and ribs found in the Ténéré Desert. It was originally classified as an ornithomimosaurian, but subsequently it was argued to be an abelisauroid. Discovery and naming The only known specimen of Afromimus is a partial skeleton consisting of seven (originating from the middle of the tail and estimated to be the 15th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, 24th, and 27th tail vertebrae), bones from the right hindlimb (the , , , and ), and part of a rib, all found within a radius of . It was discovered in 1997 at the Gadoufaoua locality in the Elrhaz Formation, in the Ténéré Desert of Niger. The specimen is catalogued as MNBH GAD112 in the Musée National Boubou Hama, the national museum of Niger in the city of Niamey. Since the specimen was exposed to the elements when it was found, it may have been more complete when it was still buried. The hindlimb elements were discovered in place, although they were weathered; the tail vertebrae were out of place, and the last vertebra in the sequence was found several meters away from the rest of the specimen. In 2017, Paul Sereno published a description of MNBH GAD112 as the holotype specimen of a new genus and species, Afromimus tenerensis. The genus name combines the Latin prefix Afro- (\\"Africa\\") and the Greek word mimos (\\"mimic\\"), in reference to the interpretation of the specimen as a member of the Ornithomimosauria. The species name combines the name of the Ténéré Desert and the Latin suffix -ensis (\\"from\\"). Subsequently, in 2019, Mauricio Cerroni and colleagues published a reassessment of Afromimus as a member of the Abelisauroidea. Description Afromimus was described as \\"medium-sized\\" for an ornithomimosaur. Judging by the fusion in the vertebrae and between the fibula and tarsus of the holotype specimen of Afromimus, the individual had reached adult size before it died. The tibia has a length of . Sereno noted that the largest specimen of the ornithomimosaur Sinornithomimus (a subadult at least seven years old) had a tibia of a similar length, and concluded that Afromimus had a somewhat smaller adult size, making it half the size of Gallimimus, twice the size of Shenzhousaurus, and three times the size of Nqwebasaurus. =Tail vertebrae= Sereno identified several distinctive characteristics in the tail vertebrae of Afromimus. The 16th tail vertebra had depressions along the top and bottom surfaces of the broad , which Sereno described as \\"peanut- shaped\\". Such a structure would have stabilized the tail from flexing to the side. The depressions on the bottom surfaces are less evident towards the rear of the tail. This trait is shared with Gallimimus and an unnamed ornithomimid from the Dinosaur Park Formation, and contrasts with the less-broad centra of the abelisauroids Majungasaurus and Masiakasaurus; however, among the Abelisauroidea, the noasaurid Elaphrosaurus also has similar vertebrae. Additionally, the prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses ( at the front and rear of the vertebrae that interlock with adjacent vertebrae) are distinctive. The sides of the prezygapophyses have a rough texture, which Sereno considered to be an autapomorphy, or distinguishing trait; however, these rough surfaces are also seen in the abelisauroids Majungasaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Ekrixinatosaurus, and Cerroni and colleagues suggested that this trait may be more widespread as indications of muscle or ligament attachments. The sides of the postzygapophyses are rough as well. The facets where the prezygapophyses interlock are also distinctive — a rounded corner on the outer surface of the postzygapophysis fit into an oval facet on the inner surface of the prezygapophysis, and the tip of the postzygapophysis fit into a rimmed depression on the prezygapophysis which was situated closer to the centrum. The purpose of these structures was likely to stiffen the tail. Sereno noted that the latter trait is shared with Sinornithomimus and more advanced ornithomimids, but the same is also present in Majungasaurus, Masiakasaurus, and several Indian abelisauroids. Several processes on the tail vertebrae of Afromimus are present as low crests or ridges, including the and , although the transverse processes become smooth by the 27th tail vertebra. Below the transverse processes, the 16th tail vertebra also has an accessory ridge, accompanied by a depression below it; the depression also becomes smooth by the 27th tail vertebra. On the bottom of the vertebra, there is a pair of prominent, roughened ridges where the s attach. The pedicels, or surfaces where the chevrons articulate with their corresponding vertebrae, are fused into a continuous, crescent-shaped surface in Afromimus. Sereno considered as an autapomorphy the fact that the fused surface was half as wide front-to-back than it was side-to-side, although Ceratosaurus, Majungasaurus, and Masiakasaurus also have the same condition. Despite this, Cerroni and colleagues noted a potential distinguishing trait in that the rearward- projecting (posterior) process of the chevron is much larger than the forward- projecting (anterior) process, which is not seen in any ornithomimosaurs or abelisauroids. =Hindlimbs= At the top end of the tibia, Sereno noted an unusual elliptical attachment scar bearing a series of roughened ridges, located below the expanded lateral condyle on the outer surface of the bone. Most ornithomimosaurs lack this scar, but it is present in the abelisauroids Masiakasaurus, Ekrixinatosaurus, Skorpiovenator, and Carnotaurus, as well as to a lesser extent in Velocisaurus and Ceratosaurus. Just to the front of the scar is the fibular crest, which is shorter and narrower than those of Sinornithomimus and Gallimimus and also becomes deeper at its bottom end. This crest stretches to the top of the bone, which is typical of abelisauroids but is unusual for ornithomimosaurs and other tetanuran theropods, where it is separated by a notch from the top. Like the two ornithomimosaurs, however, the bottom edge of the lateral condyle is clearly demarcated from the shaft of the bone. The shaft of the tibia is compressed at the front and rear, and bows outwards, unlike the relatively straight shafts of the ornithomimosaurs Sinornithomimus, Gallimimus, and Beishanlong, and the noasaurid Elaphrosaurus, but like the noasaurids Masiakasaurus and Velocisaurus. The bottom end of the tibia expands outwards to form the lateral malleolus, which is one-third the width of the bottom end and is partially fused to the (one of the tarsal bones). This partial fusion is unknown in ornithomimosaurs, but it is present in Ceratosaurus, noasaurids, and the Alvarezsauroidea. The actual articulating surface of the astragalus on the tibia is roughened and bears a raised lip, the medial buttress, at its inner rim, which is unknown in ornithomimosaurs but is present in Ceratosaurus and various abelisauroids. The inner edge of the astragalus is offset from the buttress, which is similar to Nqwebasaurus. Compared to ornithomimosaurs, the articulating surface for an ascending process of the astragalus on the tibia is much smaller and lower. Accordingly, Afromimus had a small, subrectangular ascending process on the astragalus like those of abelisauroids, but unlike Sinornithomimus, Gallimimus, and Harpymimus. The (another tarsal bone) is also more exposed in Afromimus. Unlike Sinornithomimus and Gallimimus, the fibular crest on the tibia does not join with the iliofibular tubercle or anterior trochanter (the attachment of the iliofibularis muscle) on front of the fibula, because the anterior tubercle is situated further towards the rear by about . The tubercle is roughened and better developed than in ornithomimosaurs, although a well- developed tubercle is typical of Ceratosaurus and various abelisauroids. On the inner side of the fibula, there is a deep that extends smoothly onto the shaft in the form of a trough running in front of the anterior tubercle. The fossa is covered partially by the flared tibial crest, and it is also demarcated above by a crest angled upwards at the rear. There is also a roughened attachment surface below the tibial crest (considered by Sereno to be an autapomorphy). These characteristics are similar to Ceratosaurus, Masiakasaurus, Skorpiovenator, Arcovenator, and Deltadromeus. Some tetanurans, like Tyrannosaurus, Neovenator, and Beishanlong, also have the deep fossa, but lack the surrounding crests. Nevertheless, Cerroni and colleagues noted that the tibial crest covers the fibial fossa to a much greater extent than Masiakasaurus, which is an autapomorphy. The bottom end of the fibula in Afromimus is relatively expanded for an ornithomimosaur, but it resembles Masiakasaurus, Skorpiovenator, and Xenotarsosaurus in this respect. The foot claws of Afromimus show characteristics shared between abelisauroids and ornithomimosaurs. The bottom surfaces of the claws are relatively flat, which is the case for most ornithomimosaurs (except for Beishanlong and Deinocheirus) and noasaurids. There are two grooves for the attachment of a keratin sheath on the side of the claw, one near the top and one near the bottom, which is common to some noasaurids; however, many ornithomimosaurs only have the groove on the bottom. On the bottom of the claw, there is a V-shaped platform for the attachment of the sheath, with a deep pit in between. Sereno inferred that the sheath would have been a subtriangular \\"hoof\\" in life. The inner edge of the platform is a sharp ridge while the outer edge is rounded. Some noasaurids have a similar platform. The attachment for the flexor muscle at the rear of the claw is also recessed, which is seen in ornithomimosaurs. Classification Despite various characteristics shared with abelisauroids, Sereno assigned Afromimus to the Ornithomimosauria in 2017. To support this position, he stated that the \\"peanut-shaped\\" centra and the rimmed depressions on the prezygapophyses in the tail vertebrae have been reported in Sinornithomimus, Gallimimus, and other ornithomimosaurs (Deinocheirus also has broad centra, although it lacks the prezygapophyseal depressions), while the shape of the centra contrasts with the subcircular centra in Majungasaurus, Masiakasaurus, and alvarezsauroids. He also drew attention to characteristics of the foot claws, namely the flat bottom face with a V-shaped platform and the recessed flexor attachment, which are shared with ornithomimosaurs. While he noted that the first two traits are shared with abelisauroids, as well as the additional sheath attachment groove near the top of the claw, he noted that the latter condition was not consistent among abelisauroids: the grooves in abelisauroids usually reach the tip of the claw, while they dissipate beforehand in Afromimus, and an unnamed noasaurid also from the Elrhaz Formation. Sereno also noted that the expansion of the fibula's bottom end resembles Masiakasaurus, but not the unnamed noasaurid. Within the Ornithomimosauria, Sereno did not provide a concrete position for Afromimus other than noting it was a basal (early-diverging) member. He noted that the prezygapophyses were relatively short compared to Harpymimus and Shenzhousaurus, and that the ascending process of the astragalus is much less extensive in both Afromimus and Nqwebasaurus compared to most other ornithomimosaurs. Sereno concluded that the affinities of Afromimus \\"will likely be tested most effectively by discovery of new material\\". In their 2019 paper, Cerroni and colleagues systematically analyzed the traits that Sereno noted as being shared between Afromimus and ornithomimosaurs, and concluded that many of the same traits can also be found among abelisauroids (see §Description for further discussion of the analysis). In particular, Afromimus shares with abelisauroids: * Tail vertebrae with depressions in the prezygapophyses * Chevrons with fused pedicels which are short front-to-back * A fibular crest on the tibia continuous with the top end * A prominent iliofibular tubercle on the fibula * A subrectangular ascending process of the astragalus fused to the fibula * Foot claws with a recessed flexor attachment (i.e. lacking a flexor tubercle) * Foot claws with two grooves and a bump on the side To rigorously test the affinities of Afromimus, they added it to three phylogenetic datasets: two generally encompassing theropods, from Carrano et al. (2012) and Choiniere et al. (2012); and one focusing specifically on the Ceratosauria, from Brissón Egli et al. (2016). The most parsimonious phylogenetic trees for the first two analyses found Afromimus to be a member of the Ceratosauria, grouping with Masiakasaurus and Majungasaurus in the former and with Masiakasaurus in the latter. Forcing Afromimus to be an ornithomimosaur resulted in a less parsimonious tree for the latter analysis. Finally, adding Afromimus to the ceratosaur-centric matrix resulted in it being found as part of the Noasauridae in a polytomy (unresolved group). In this analysis, the inclusion of Afromimus in the Ceratosauria is supported by the prominent iliofibular tubercle; its inclusion in the Noasauridae is supported by the flattened bottom end of the tibia and the fusion of the astragalar ascending process to the fibula. The phylogenetic tree from the analysis is partially replicated below. Given these results, Cerroni and colleagues referred Afromimus to the Abelisauroidea, with a likely position in the Noasauridae. However, they maintained it as a valid taxon because of the large posterior process of the chevron and the extent to which the tibial crest of the fibula covers the fibular fossa. =Evolution of ornithomimosaurs= In 2014, Romain Allain and colleagues suggested that the close relation of the African Nqwebasaurus to Eurasian basal ornithomimosaurs indicates that the group was widespread before the breakup of Pangaea. In his description of Afromimus, Sereno suggested that southern ornithomimosaurs such as Afromimus and Nqwebasaurus, which he labelled as the only unambiguous ornithomimosaurs from the southern hemisphere, were an early phase in the group's evolution. However, the removal of Afromimus from the Ornithomimosauria by Cerroni and colleagues weakens this hypothesis, as do several analyses excluding Nqwebasaurus from the Ornithomimosauria; they considered the presence of ornithomimosaurs in the southern hemisphere to be equivocal. Paleoecology No other fossil vertebrates were found with the remains of Afromimus at the Gadoufaoua locality. However, other dinosaurs are known from Gaoufaoua: the theropods Suchomimus/Cristatusaurus, Kryptops, and Eocarcharia; the sauropod Nigersaurus; and the ornithopods Ouranosaurus, Lurdusaurus, and Elrhazosaurus. Other fauna include crocodilians, such as Sarcosuchus, Stolokrosuchus, Araripesuchus, and Anatosuchus; turtles of the genera Teneremys, Platycheloides, Taquetochelys, and Araripemys; and fish, including the coelacanth Mawsonia, the lungfish Ceratodus, and the ray-finned fish Lepidotes and Pliodetes.

It was organized by the Giles-Parscale firm in San Antonio, Texas. The campaign paid Giles-Parscale as much as $94 million for fundraising, political advertising, and digital media services, including the creation of Trump's web site. A new database of voter information named \\"Project Alamo\\" was at the heart of Giles-Parscale's efforts, allowing highly targeted advertising on social media platforms. The advertising campaigns added to the database over time, driving more effective targeting. The scale of the fundraising and political advertising campaigns on social media was massive, with hundreds of thousands of targeted ads being delivered daily. Project Alamo has been credited as an important factor in Trump's 2016 victory.  Fundraising  Giles-Parscale raised over $250 Million for Donald Trump, primarily through Facebook. Giles-Parscale used targeting tools that are part of the Facebook advertising platform to deliver carefully crafted ads soliciting small donations from specific audiences defined by demographics, interests, and affinities. When a contributor would make a small donation, that person's information would be rolled up in a database of contributors that the firm would then reach more directly for future fundraising efforts. Facebook was thus used for cost-effective donor discovery, essentially a funnel for new contributors. After the election, Brad Parscale, a principal at Giles-Parscale and the Trump campaign's Digital Director, described how the Facebook fundraising funnel worked: \\"Maybe you see an ad on Facebook and donate $5. Now you're in my system. So now it doesn't become efficient for me to get money from you on Facebook because they charge me. So I start using other means; cell phone, email and other operations to get to you to make further donations.\\" Giles-Parscale targeted fundraising ads through Facebook's \\"Lookalike Audiences\\" tool, finding new people with similar characteristics to known Trump supporters based on demographics, interests, and affinities. The inputs for lookalike targeting included a database of Trump supporters from the campaign as well as multiple data sources from the Republican National Committee. Once the lookalike audience profiles were defined, ads could then be targeted and served to them based on what was known about them. Giles-Parscale created and A/B-tested thousands of ad variants, tuning them for maximum effectiveness. Facebook allows micro-targeting down to neighborhoods (geographically) and also by very narrow interests and affinities.  Political advertising  The fundraising ads created to attract donors also contained key political messages and themes for the Trump campaign, so the fundraising ads doubled as political ads. The cost to surface a fundraising ad would naturally drop as more people interacted with the ad (through Facebook's surfacing algorithms), increasing its effectiveness as a messaging tool as well as a donor discovery mechanism. This was not a strategy that was unique to Giles-Parscale or to Trump, but the scale at which this dual strategy was used in Project Alamo was certainly notable. In addition to fundraising ads, Giles-Parscale identified 14.4 million persuadable voters in key districts of swing states and targeted political ads at them through Facebook and other social media platforms. The ads were intended to galvanize turn-out for Trump supporters and suppress turn-out for key Democratic voters. In the San Antonio Express News interview referenced earlier, Parscale said of the targeted ads, \\"That's why we won. We knew just the voters we needed to turn out and we turned them out in big numbers\\". Thousands of ad variants were A/B-tested for effectiveness. Gary Coby, director of advertising at the Republican National Committee, said, \\"On any given day…the campaign was running 40,000 to 50,000 variants of its ads, testing how they performed in different formats, with subtitles and without, and static versus video, among other small differences. On the day of the third presidential debate in October, the team ran 175,000 variations.\\" Coby called this \\"A/B testing on steroids.\\"  Dark advertising and dark posts  Most of the Giles-Parscale Facebook ads in the 2016 campaign were so-called \\"dark posts\\"; targeted Facebook ads that appear in a user's Facebook Newsfeed without visibility to anyone else on the platform (e.g. other Facebook friends) are essentially \\"unpublished posts\\" and have been called \\"dark advertising\\" or \\"dark posts\\" because of the lack of a link to the advertiser and any form of tracking or accountability. While dark posts sound nefarious, they have actually been widely used for commercial advertising, not just for political advertising. As Gary Coby says, \\"The only way an ad isn't a 'dark post' is if you're promoting an organic News Feed post. It's impossible to properly use the Facebook platform, to test or buy at scale, with just organic posts.\\" In response to the outcry over dark advertising on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg (CEO of Facebook) announced in September, 2017 that all future political ads will be linked to the advertiser. Additional details were rolled out in October, 2017: All political ads will have call-outs or banners to show who paid for them. Facebook will also aggregate every ad purchased by an advertiser on a special page and will maintain a searchable archive of each advertiser's ads going back four years.  The name \\"Project Alamo\\"  The moniker \\"Project Alamo\\" was initially attached to the database of voter information created and used by Giles-Parscale during the 2016 campaign but eventually encompassed the associated fundraising and political advertising efforts as well. The name is believed to be derived from the location of Giles-Parscale in San Antonio (which was the nerve center of the digital operations during the campaign), also the location of the Battle of the Alamo.

The Boxers, also known by various other names in both Chinese and English (see Names), was a Chinese secret society known for having triggered the Boxer Rebellion from 1899 to 1901. It became a massive movement, counting anywhere between 50,000 and 100,000 members. Though the group originally supported the downfall of the Qing leadership of China for being \\"westernized\\", the group would later support the ruling Empress Dowager to try and eliminate groups the Boxers opposed, including Christians, Europeans, Caucasians, Japanese, \\"Western\\" Chinese, and others who were determined to be detrimental to their efforts, at certain points including other secret societies. The group was all but destroyed by the end of the Boxer Rebellion, with most of its leadership and structure eliminated, though some of its former members continued their actions in various other groups across China.  Names  In the English speaking world, the society is mainly known as the Boxers, due to its members' practice of Chinese martial arts, at the time called \\"Chinese boxing\\". Though the group had existed since the mid-1880s in China, it was first reported officially as the National Righteousness Group () in an 1899 Qing report intent on solving disturbances in the Shandong and Zhili Provinces. This is later clarified in a follow-up report to have been a mistake, and that the actual name is in fact the League of Harmony and Justice (). During 1898, the group was known as the Plum Blossom Fists (), though this name would not be used into 1899 and after however. In more recent English publications, the name of the group from 1899, Fists of Harmony and Justice () or the Society of Righteous Harmonious Fists tends to be used over the yìhétuán based name. The group is also sometimes known in English by any one of its Chinese names, with more recent publications tending to use Pinyin, and older publications using Wade–Giles or other systems.  Origins  During the rule of the Qing dynasty within China, there was often significant influence and force from non-state secret societies, such as the Big Swords Society or the White Lotus Society. These groups often took advantage, through armed members, of the lack of imperial order in many areas of China, along with rampant corruption that enabled the societies to function even in well-controlled areas. Yi-he boxing, as it was later practised by the Fists of Harmony and Justice, long predated the movement. In 1779, the Qing government already investigated rumours according to which a man named Yang practised this martial arts style in Guan County, Shandong, though state authorities were unable to confirm this at the time. Though the Boxer movement would originate in Shandong and Hebei intent on lessening governmental influence throughout China by means of violence, the group would quickly include its directive to attempt to eliminate all foreign influence also, which was considered at the time to have already penetrated the imperial government. The group at this time was deeply associated with other secret societies in their efforts to eliminate Christians, as can be seen in the 4 July 1896 with attacks on German missionaries in the regions of Western Shandong that later were controlled by the Boxers. The Boxer movement first began in these areas in the mid-1880s as various group with similar aims, led by local influences such as Zhang Decheng in Hebei, and Zhu Hongdeng in Shandong, both leading small but devoted groups directly under their personal control. These small groups served as local enforcers of the Boxers' efforts to control the populace, to curtail the influence of both the Qing government and that of foreigners, particularly Christians. During 1898, the previously separate Boxer groups in Shandong and Hebei would fall under much more direct leadership, with the establishment of structure into the group in the form of ranks. This would also involve the renaming of the group into the \\"Plum Blossom Fists\\". However, the name-change was not used past 1898, with the name \\"Fists of Harmony and Justice\\" used instead. On 23 May 1898, an investigation was made by the Guangxu Emperor into disturbances in the Shandong-Zhili border region by a supposed \\"National Righteousness Group\\", with the possibility of 10,000 Boxer soldiers being under group command in this region. A representative of the monarchy, Zhang Rumei, would be sent along with an army to put down any unrest in the region. The result of the meeting was not negative, with Zhang reporting that there was no trouble in the region, along with more accurate reports on the group's smaller numbers. The movement was composed of illiterate people. First and foremost peasants, to which were added idle youth, ruined artisans, and laid off workers. Some Boxer recruits were disbanded imperial soldiers and local militiamen.  Conflict  In March 1898, the Boxers started to agitate the population in the streets with the slogan \\"Uphold the Qing, destroy foreigners!\\". Their main leader was Cao FuTian. Other leaders in Zhili Province were Liu Chengxiang, and Zhang Decheng. After a battle with the Imperial troops in October 1899, the Boxers focused mainly on missionaries and Christian activities, as they were considered \\"tainting the purity of the Chinese culture\\". The Qing government was divided towards how to react to the Boxer's activities. The conservative element of the court was in favour of them. Prince Duan, a fervent supporter of their cause, arranged a meeting between Cao and Empress Dowager Ci Xi. At the meeting, the crown prince even wore a Boxer uniform to show support. At the beginning of June 1900, about 450 men of the Eight-Nation Alliance arrived in Beijing to protect the foreign legations under siege by the Boxers and Imperial Army, in what was the Siege of the International Legations. The Boxers were at their peak, now supported by some elements of the Imperial Army. They changed their slogan to \\"Support the Qing, destroy foreigners!\\". The Boxers multiplied their murderous actions against foreigners and Chinese Christians. In Beijing, the Boxers were officially placed under command of members of the Court, such as Prince Duan. During the Rebellion, the Boxers, fighting troops of the Eight-Nation Alliance with close combat weapons or even their own hands, were decimated. After the conflict, The Empress Dowager Ci Xi ordered the repression of the remaining Boxers, in an attempt to calm the foreign nations.  In popular culture  The Boxer Rebellion is portrayed in the film 55 Days at Peking, by Nicholas Ray (1963). The Boxers are portrayed in Boxers and Saints, a comic series by Gene Luen Yang. The main character of Boxers, Lee Bao, becomes a leader of the Boxer Rebellion. The Boxer Rebellion is graphically depicted in the Shaw Brothers production of ‘’Boxer Rebellion’‘ (1976) directed by Chang Cheh. This film was distributed in the U.S. as “The Bloody Avengers” by World Northal Corporation in 1980.

The genus contains a single species, O. crassipes, named by Christian Foth and Oliver Rauhut in 2017.  Discovery and naming  194x194px It was originally misidentified as a species of a pterodactyloid pterosaur and named Pterodactylus crassipes. In 1970 it was identified as an Archaeopteryx by paleontologist John Ostrom, who called it the \\"Haarlem specimen\\", since it was kept in the Teylers Museum in Haarlem.Ostrom JH. Archaeopteryx: notice of a “new” specimen. Science. 1970;170:537–8 In 2017 Christian Foth and Oliver Rauhut concluded it was more closely related to the Chinese Anchiornis and introduced the generic name Ostromia, named after Ostrom. The only known specimen is fairly incomplete compared to most specimens of Archaeopteryx, as it only preserves limb bones, cervical vertebrae and ribs. Most bones are also incomplete, as a result of the poor preservation. A high-quality cast of the holotype (Teylers specimens TM 6928 and 6929) is in the collections of the Bayerische Staatssammlung für Paläontologie und Geologie under the specimen number SNSB-BSPG 1971 I 211. Description = Differences from Archaeopteryx = Diagram showing known remains The Haarlem specimen has many features which contrast with those of Archaeopteryx. The length ratio between the third and the first metacarpal of the hand is larger in Ostromia than in any Archaeopteryx specimen. In addition, the ungual (claw) of the first digit of the hand is smaller than the corresponding first metacarpal, while in Archaeopteryx the claw is larger. The Haarlem specimen's metatarsals are also estimated to be proportionally longer than those of Archaeopteryx specimens. Restoration In addition, the Haarlem specimen shares several features with Anchiornis. Most notably, they both have longitudinal furrows on the top and bottom sides of their manual phalanges (finger bones). While such structures can be a result of collapsed or broken bones (as is the case in several Archaeopteryx specimens), the straight, smooth edges of the furrows in Ostromia and Anchiornis indicate that they are legitimate biological features. The pubic shaft of the Haarlem specimen is also strongly flexed backwards and has a triangular pubic boot, similar to the pubis of Anchiornis but unlike that of Archaeopteryx.

Anchiornithids have been classified at varying positions in the maniraptoran tree, with some scientists classifying them as a distinct family, a basal subfamily of Troodontidae, members of Archaeopterygidae, or an assemblage of dinosaurs that are an evolutionary grade within Avialae or Paraves.  Description  Anchiornithids share many general features with other Paraves and early avialans. They were small and lightly-built feathered carnivores, similar in biology to Archaeopteryx, early dromaeosaurids like Microraptor, and particularly troodontids. They are almost exclusively known from Late Jurassic Chinese deposits, although Ostromia was discovered in Germany and Yixianosaurus (a putative member of the group only known from forelimbs) is believed to hail from the early Cretaceous. Most had long legs, arms, and hands, although some (Eosinopteryx) had slightly reduced forelimbs. = Feathering = Serikornis sungei Although it is practically certain that every anchiornithid possessed advanced pennaceous feathers, there is still much variety in feathering between genera (or between individuals in the case of numerous genera such as Anchiornis). Most had vaned tail feathers forming a frond-shaped tail, with the tails feathers of Caihong being particularly long and in some cases asymmetrical. However, Eosinopteryx, Serikornis, and Aurornis were preserved with short and downy tail feathering. Some studies on the body feathering of anchiornithids indicate that the feathers were pennaceous, but seemingly lacked barbules, making them \\"shaggy\\" or \\"silky\\" in life. Long pennaceous feathers were present on the arms of most anchiornithids. However, these feathers were slender, symmetrical, and unspecialized, probably useless for flight. They formed rows which were attached directly to a large fleshy propatagium connecting the upper and lower arm. Most anchiornithids also had dense feathering extending down their legs. A few had short leg feathering, but most (Anchiornis and Pedopenna, for example) had very long pennaceous feathers on their legs, giving them the moniker of \\"four-winged dinosaurs\\", a trait also shared by microraptorians. Eosinopteryx seemingly lacked any sort of feathers on the lower part of its legs, but its close relative Serikornis possessed both plumaceous (downy) feathers extending onto its toes as well as pennaceous feathers further up the leg. = Distinguishing features = Foth and Rauhut (2017) established several diagnostic features present in anchiornithids: * Nutrient foramina on the dentary are placed in a deep groove (also in most troodontids and some other coelurosaurs); * Anterior dentary teeth which are smaller, more numerous, and more closely spaced than those in the middle of the tooth row (also in most troodontids); * The front edge of the acromion margin of the scapula is bent or hooked outwards (also in several oviraptorosaurs and more derived avialans); * The inside surface of proximal part of the fibula is flat (also in alvarezsaurids, therizinosauroids and derived avialans); * Fan-shaped posterior dorsal neural spines (also in compsognathids and some derived avialans); * Extensive large pennaceous feathers on the foot and ankle (also in Microraptor and Sapeornis).  Systematic history  In 2015 Chatterjee created Tetrapterygidae in the second edition of his book The Rise of Birds: 225 Million Years of Evolution, where he included Xiaotingia, Aurornis, Anchiornis, and even Microraptor; together they were proposed to be the sister group of the Avialae.Chatterjee, S. (2015). The rise of birds: 225 million years of evolution. Johns Hopkins University Press, 45–48. However this family is invalid as must include the genus Tetrapteryx, which is the junior synonym of Grus – therefore Tetrapterygidae is a junior synonym of Gruidae. In their description of Wiehenvenator Rauhut and colleagues had informally called the group as \\"Anchiornithosaurs\\" which they placed outside of Avialae.Rauhut, O.W.M., Hübner T.R., and Lanser, K., 2015, \\"A new theropod dinosaur from the late Middle Jurassic of Germany and theropod faunal turnover during the Jurassic\\", Libro de resúmenes del V Congreso Latinoamericano de Paleontología de Vertebrados. 62 The clade was originally named as \\"Anchiornithinae\\" by Xu et al. (2016) and defined as for \\"the most inclusive clade including Anchiornis but not Archaeopteryx, Gallus, Troodon, Dromaeosaurus, Unenlagia, or Epidexipteryx\\". In 2017 Foth and Rauhut in their re-evaluation of the Haarlem Archaeopteryx specimen (which they classified it in its own distinct genus Ostromia) found that the anchiornithids are a distinct family closer to the ancestry of birds. They provided their own definition of Anchiornithidae as \\"as all maniraptoran theropods that are more closely related to Anchiornis huxleyi than to Passer domesticus, Archaeopteryx lithographica, Dromaeosaurus albertensis, Troodon formosus, or Oviraptor philoceratops.\\" During the description of Halszkaraptor, Cau et al. (2017) incorporated many putative anchiornithids into two different large-scale phylogenetic analyses. The first analysis was a comprehensive study of theropod dinosaurs originally designed by Lee et al. for a 2014 paper on miniaturization in theropods leading up to the evolution of birds. Cau et al.'s usage of this first analysis found support for Anchiornithidae being a distinctive family of avialans. The strict consensus tree of the first analysis is given below: The second analysis was first used in a different paper on theropod size published by Brusatte et al. in 2014. This analysis (which was updated by Cau et al. during a 2015 study on the affinities of Balaur bondoc) focused specifically on coelurosaurs and found that anchiornithids (represented only by Anchiornis, Xiaotingia, Aurornis, and Eosinopteryx in the analysis) were troodontids rather than avialans, in contrast to the first analysis. The description of Caihong by Hu et al. (2018) also implemented the Brusatte analysis and found the same result. However, this study also implemented an analysis performed by Xu et al. (2015) during the description of Yi qi. This analysis placed anchiornithids (or as the study calls them, members of \\"Anchiorninae\\") either as troodontids or unresolved paravians, depending on whether parsimony or bootstrap analyses are used. An analysis used in the description of the Jurassic bird Alcmonavis by Rauhut et al. (2019) recovered anchiornithids (represented in the analysis by Eosinopteryx, Anchiornis, and Ostromia) as the most basal avialans. Xiaotingia and Pedopenna were placed as more advanced avialans closer to Archaeopteryx. In 2019 with the description of the Late Jurassic genus Hesperornithoides, Hartman et al., using every named Mesozoic maniraptoromorph (with the addition of 28 unnamed specimens), which they scored 700 characters and 501 operational taxonomic units, found that most of the anchiornithids are members of Archaeopterygidae, with only Xiaotingia and Yixianosaurus being classified as a troodontid and a dromaeosaurid respectively, Pedopenna found in many possible positions within the Paraves phylogeny, and Ostromia described too late to include in the analysis. Below is their phylogeny: The cladogram below shows the results of the phylogenetic analysis by Cau (2020). Palaeoecology A good majority of the known anchiornithid fossils have been recovered from the Tiaojishan Formation in Liaoning, China dating back to 160 million years. The climate during this period of time would have been subtropical to temperate, warm and humid based on the plant life present in the Tiaojishan Formation. This environment was dominated plant by gymnosperm trees. There were ginkgopsids like Ginkoites, Ginkgo, Baiera, Czekanowskia, and Phoenicopsis. There were also conifers like Pityophyllum, Rhipidiocladus, Elatocladus, Schizolepis, and Podozamites. Also, Lycopsids like Lycopodites and Sellaginellities, horsetails (Sphenopsida) like Equisetum, cycads like Anomozamites, and ferns (Filicopsida) like Todites and Coniopteris. The only Chinese anchiornithid to not have been discovered in the Tiaojishan Formation is Yixianosaurus longimanus, which was found in the 125 million-year-old Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation, in the same area. Only one genus of anchiornithid has been found outside of China: Ostromia, which is found in the Painten Formation from Riedenburg, Bavaria, Germany.

By him she was mother of two countesses and grandmother of Afonso I, first king of Portugal.  Biography  Jimena's origin has been subject to scholarly discussion and debate. Her patronymic indicates that her father was named Munio, and a contemporary chronicler, Bishop Pelagius of Oviedo, called her nobilisima (very noble), while the Crónicas anónimas de Sahagún describes her similarly, muy noble. The 17th century historian Luis Alfonso de Carvallo made her sister of Galician count Rodrigo Muñoz and daughter of count Munio Rodríguez by his wife Jimena Ordóñez, granddaughter of king Bermudo II of León. In this he was followed the next century by church historian Enrique Flórez, but both the chronology and the politics would seem to militate against this placement. She would appear to be the woman of this name in charters of the monastery of San Pedro de Montes along with a Munio Muñoz and his wife Velasquita. With Munio appearing to be too old to have been her brother, historian Quintana Prieto suggested that these were Jimena's parents. He likewise suggests that Munio was the count of this name who accompanied Alfonso to Seville. Other historians have accepted this relationship, and further, have made Munio Muñoz a son of Munio Rodríguez and Jimena Ordóñez, by which connection Jimena would be a descendant of Bermudo II. On the other hand, Canal Sánchez Pagín called attention to a Jimena Muñoz who was sister of Asturian count Rodrigo Muñoz, of Urraca Muñoz, wife of count Gómez González, and of Enderquina Muñoz, wife of count Fernando Díaz, all children of nobilisimi comitis Monio Gonçaluizi (very noble count Munio González). He concluded that, among the possible solutions to the parentage of Jimena, it was most likely she was identical to the daughter of this count Munio González and his wife Mayor. In this he was followed by genealogist Szabolcs de Vajay and historian Jaime de Salazar y Acha, who further showed that a count Munio Rodríguez (distinct from the husband of Jimena Ordóñez) had two daughters by his wife Jimena Muñoz: Velasquita and Mayor Muñoz, and he also showed that the wife of Munio Muñoz was named Velasquita Muñoz. He concluded that the king's lover, Jimena, was daughter of Munio González and this Mayor Muñoz, making her niece rather than daughter of Munio Muñoz and Velasquita Muñoz. In his study of the bishops of Astorga, Quintana Prieto suggested that Jimena was a relative of bishop Pedro of Astorga, who was deprived of his seat in the early 1070s, and confined at the San Pedro del Montes monastery. The bishop's father was named Munio González. Jimeno would make donations both to the San Pedro monastery and to Astorga Cathedral, as well as to the Hospital de San Juan. Jimena is thought to have formed a liaison with Alfonso in the period between his first and second marriages, and she appears to have retired from court not long after the birth of her younger daughter and Alfonso's marriage to Constance of Burgundy. He would name his former mistress his tenente (non- hereditary feudal administrator) over Castillo de Cornatel in El Bierzo, a role she occupied from 1093 to 1108. She died in 1128.  Burial  Epitaph of Jimena Muñoz: Quam deus a pena defendat dicta Semena Alphonsi vidui regis amica fui; Copia, forma, genus, dos morum, cultus amenus, Me regnatoris prostituere thoris, Me simul et Regem mortis persolvere legem. Fata coegerunt, que fera queque terunt Terdenis demptis super hec de mille ducentis, Quator eripies, que fuit era. Scies84. Jimena would be interred in San Andrés monastery, Vega de Espinareda, in the El Bierzo region of León. Her grave, now lost, was once marked with an inscribed memorial stone that is now held by the Museo de León in that city.  Issue  By her relationship with Alfonso, Jimena Muñoz was mother of two daughters, both of whom would marry prominent counts. *Elvira Alfónsez (c. 1079aft. April 1157), who was married first to Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse and then to Count Fernando Fernández de Carrión. *Teresa Alfónsez (c. 108011 November 1130), who married Henry, Count of Portugal; they received the right to rule the County of Portugal and their eldest son, Afonso Henriques, became the first King of Portugal.

Sir Frank William Wills Kt. (17 August 1852 – 26 March 1932) of Berkeley Square, Bristol, England, was a member of the Wills tobacco family, who became a noted British architect and went on to serve as Lord Mayor of Bristol.  Early life and career  Frank Wills was born on 17 August 1852 in Bristol into a large family, as the 5th of seven children born to Henry Overton Wills II and Henry's second wife Mary Seccombe (1815–1897). There were also eleven children from Henry's first marriage to Isabella Board (1806–1843). Frank's father Henry was one of the owners of the W.D. & H.O. Wills tobacco company, which became the largest tobacco importer and manufacturer of tobacco products in late 19th-century Britain. Frank had several brothers who followed their father into the family tobacco business, but he was drawn instead to a technical career. He initially attended Mill Hill School in London and Amersham Hall in Buckinghamshire, before entering the Merchant Venturer's Technical College in Bristol, where he trained as an architect and surveyor. He ultimately became one of the most respected architects in Bristol, and built several notable buildings, including the main W.D. & H.O. Wills company factory on East Street in Bedminster, the facade of which is partially preserved in the modern building. He also worked on the Bedminster Library, several churches, part of the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, and the Bristol Grammar School. Residence - Nos 15 /16 Berkeley Square, Bristol  Later years and death  His interests turned in later years to politics and public service, which led him to serve in 1891 as president of the Anchor Society, a charitable organisation in Bristol that looked after the old and infirm. He went on to city politics, becoming in 1908 a City Councillor, then in 1910–11 the Lord Mayor of Bristol. He was knighted on 28 June 1912 by King George V during a royal visit to the opening of the Edward VII Memorial Wing of the Bristol Royal Infirmary (BRI) in Bristol. He was also a Justice of the Peace, and died a much respected citizen on 26 March 1932 in Bristol, where he is buried in the Arnos Vale Cemetery. A portrait of him by an unknown artist hangs in the Mansion House of Bristol City Council.  Family connections  Sir Frank Wills had several notable family connections. His grandfather was Henry Overton Wills I, who went from co- owning a small tobacco shop in 1786 on Castle Street in Bristol, to owning a succession of tobacco companies. H.O. Wills died in 1826 and was succeeded by his sons William Day Wills (Frank Will's uncle) and Henry Overton Wills II (Franks's father). They went on in 1830 to found W.D. & H.O. Wills, which grew to become the largest tobacco company in Britain. They were followed by Frank's cousin Sir William Henry Wills (Lord Winterstoke), who became the first chairman in 1901 of the newly created Imperial Tobacco Company, which made him essentially the head of the British tobacco industry. Frank Wills also had two half-brothers of note – Sir Edward Payson Wills and Sir Frederick Wills, who both became baronets, and like Frank were past presidents of the Anchor Society. Sir Frederick Wills also served as a member of parliament. Another half brother was Henry Overton Wills III, who became first Chancellor of the University of Bristol. He was also uncle of Gilbert Wills, 1st Baron Dulverton, Sir Ernest Wills, 3rd Baronet of Hazelwood, & Sir George Alfred Wills, Baronet of Blagdon, & great grandfather of Sir John Gilmour, 4th Baronet of Lundin & Montrave. In 1874 Frank married Sarah Rebecca Dobell, a daughter of Henry William Dobell of Sherard House, Eltham ( who was Comptroller General ) & Mary Charlotte Seth-Smith, whose father was Seth Smith (property developer), who built large proportions of Mayfair and Belgravia in the early 19th century.

The service helped develop and support the resistance by bringing in agents, wireless operators and supplies. Parachute drop was the primary method by which the Special Duties units delivered supplies and most of the agents to the occupied countries. They also developed an air taxi service to pick up agents, political leaders and special communications from occupied Europe and bring them to England. On the outward flight the air taxi service also delivered agents and high value packages to France. Special Duties flights flew to target fields in Vichy France, Occupied France, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece. By the end of the war Special Duties units were also operating in the Far East. The air units were controlled by the Royal Air Force, and worked closely with the SOE and the SIS. Formation With the fall of France in June 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill advocated the development of a resistance movement in Europe. His aim was two-fold: to develop a spirit of resistance in the Nazi occupied countries, and to develop a fifth column of resistance fighters who would be able to assist in the liberation of their countries at some future point when the British would be able to return. To support these aims a method of communication and supply to the resistance needed to be developed. To this purpose a highly secret organisation separate from MI5 was formed which had no official existence. Formed on 22 July 1940 under Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare, it was called the Special Operations Executive (SOE). Hugh Dalton, right, Minister of Economic Warfare, and Colin Gubbins, chief of SOE, talking to a Czech officer during a visit to Czech troops near Leamington Spa, Warwickshire Known only among the highest levels of the cabinet, extensive efforts were taken to keep its existence secret. The SOE cloaked itself by interacting with other agencies under multiple, seemingly unrelated names. Traditional armed service organisations might deal with the Inter-Services Research Bureau, the Joint Technical Board, or the Special Training Schools Headquarters. Over at the Admiralty the naval service dealt with the NID (Q), at the War Office the MO I(SP), while at the Air Ministry the operative entity was known as the AI IO. Most never gained an insight that these entities were all the same organisation, nor did they penetrate the nature and extent of the organisation. To support the movement forming in Europe a clandestine air service was necessary. Foreign Office officials approached the Air Ministry to ask if agents could be parachuted or flown into France and the Low Countries. They received a frosty reception. Air marshal Charles Portal, commander-in-chief of Bomber Command, balked at using aircraft just to ferry spies. His Air vice-marshal, Arthur Harris, did not want to divert airplanes and pilots needed elsewhere \\"to carry ragamuffins to distant spots.\\" Others, notably Churchill, disagreed. The SOE got its support, and the Special Duties service units were created. Harris was tasked by the Air Ministry with providing the air services support, which he did, though he continued to argue that it was taking resources away from the main task. The air units created and the missions they were performing were kept secret. This sometimes proved a challenge. In one instance in 1942 poor weather resulted in a Whitley flight having to return without dropping its agents. On the return trip the plane crashed along the English coast, killing all aboard. Among the dead were five SOE agents dressed as civilians. It was explained to the public that they were members of the press along to observe the results of a bombing raid. When a local newspaper pressed further, asking why so many press members were aboard the flight, the Army Special Investigation Branch made a visit to the paper, and the story was laid to rest. Said a pilot after the war: \\"Even when high ranking officers who were not in the know asked about the work we were doing we had to lie like old Harry. It was court martial if we breathed a word about the job. Not even the mechanics knew about the passenger flights.\\" For the special duties aircrews, who they were and what they did remained a secret till the war had been over for over 30 years. Initially a single flight of aircraft was formed on 21 August 1940 by Fighter Group 11 and set aside to support the effort. Control was transferred to No. 3 Group on 2 October 1940. The needs of the SOE grew over time, as did the air units supporting them. Eventually two \\"Special Duties\\" squadrons were created by the RAF as a link with the underground movements in the occupied countries. A third was added in 1943 to work in the Mediterranean theater. In the last year of the war a fourth was added for the Far East. The squadrons worked in support of both the SOE and the SIS, though with the SOE tasked with organising, arming and supplying a civilian army, it required the lion's share of the air transport services. The peak effort was reached just around the time of the Allied invasion of occupied Europe in June 1944. Training The first task of the RAF was to deliver agents to France trained in the selection of fields suitable for their aircraft to land and take off again. These agents had to be fluent in French to blend in. Once the agent was in place and had selected a number of potential locations for landings he was ready to receive an operation. =Operator training= French nationals trained as agents were presented to the RAF to be specially trained as 'operators', known in French as the chef de terrain. Training initially was done at 'F' section in London at Tempsford's Station 61, the so-called \\"Joe School.\\" The training was completed at RAF Tempsford, with the aid of the special duties pilots from 161 Squadron. This was done during the dark of the moon, the pilot's off periods. Commented one pilot after the war: \\"We had to have decent fields, so we brought back men of the resistance movement to teach them the sort of places to select and what to do to help us to land.\\"Stuart, James RAF Fly-by Nights Beat Gestapo Evening Standard, 16 June 1945 The operators learned what to look for in selecting a field: a clear path without trees or telephone wires, with at least 600 yards of clearing. The ground had to be firm. They were to avoid mud at all costs. The agents trained were either of French heritage, were French expatriates living in exile in England, or were resistance members picked up from France and brought back to England for training. Some of them had been pilots in the French Armée de l'Air. Agents were trained at the false airfield at \\"RAF Somersham\\" in signaling aircraft in Morse code and in laying out a flare path. Supply drop flare paths were made with 5 flashlights forming an \\"X\\". For a Lysander landing the skeleton flare path was made with 3 flashlights that formed an inverted \\"L\\". To avoid problems the RAF strongly preferred to land on fields handled by operators they had trained. If an operator started to pick out less than desirable landing fields he would be recalled to Tempsford for remedial training. Following a mission in April 1942 that almost resulted in an aircraft and pilot being lost on a boggy field the RAF insisted they would only land aircraft on fields handled by an operator that 161 Squadron had trained. If the agent failed the training he would not be allowed to manage landings. Operators who passed their training were said to be qualified to \\"lay on an operation\\". =Pilot training= The special duties squadrons had to recruit and train pilots for their command. Being a secret organisation, recruitment was a problem. Some pilots were drawn to the SD squadrons by personal contacts, others by the pilot's own experience in escaping from the continent. All of them had an \\"Above Average\\" pilot rating. Many had also qualified as navigators. Self-reliance in navigation was an important quality for the SD pilots. Many judged it a more essential skill for a successful SD pilot than piloting the aircraft itself. A pilot had to fly in the dark of night over enemy occupied territory, frequently in weather that grounded other squadrons, and navigate by himself to a small dark field in the middle of France. Pilots had to be self-reliant, capable of thinking and acting on their own. Hugh Verity wrote a set of instructions for the Lysander pilots in A Flight of 161 Squadron. These were guides offered from an experienced Lysander pilot to the novitiate, but were more helpful tips rather than a set of hard fast rules. 161 Squadron did not have rigid rules they followed, as conditions and obstacles such as bad weather, low cloud and fog, boggy landing fields, or possible enemy action were too variable. As 161 Squadron commander Charles Pickard often remarked: \\"There's always bloody something!\\" A low flying SD modified Lysander over England It took about a month for a pilot to complete the training and for the commanding officer to determine if the pilot would be able to do the job. Training required the pilot to be extremely comfortable with the layout of the aircraft's controls. He had to learn how to work out a course to his target and back. The course set was made up of a string of pinpoints, navigational terrain features which were identifiable and whose location was sure. The course was a 50 mile wide corridor designed to avoid German flak emplacements. On his trip the pilot flew from pinpoint to pinpoint, staying in the corridor defined till he reached the target area. He would practice this by flying by navigation alone over England by day, without making use of the radio to ask for a homing bearing, flying from navigation point to navigation point. The flights would be repeated at night. Next they practiced night time landings and take offs from a grass field. This training was done at \\"RAF Somersham\\", a \\"dummy\\" airfield near RAF Tempsford initially used as a decoy during the Blitz. It was later put to use by the RAF and the SOE for training of agent operators and Lysander pilots, as the rough field approximated a typical landing ground in occupied France. The final test for a Lysander pilot was to navigate over the continent through a corridor free of flak to a pinpoint target in France south of Saumur. The target was described to the pilot as a light. When the pilot arrived over the target he found a brilliantly lit rectangle. It was in fact a prison camp, whose bright lighting of the fence wire made it a \\"pinpoint\\" of uniquely brilliant quality. When the pilot returned and reported on this astonishing target he confirmed he had made it there and was made operational. Operations =Parachute drops of supplies= Jean Garcin and some of his maquis resistance fighters in 1944 Supply delivery was the primary undertaking of the Special Duties squadrons. To support the burgeoning resistance forces a great deal of material was needed, and the needs increased as numbers in the resistance increased. In May 1941 an Air Ministry staff officer estimated that to supply 45,000 resistance fighters in the field would require 2,000 sorties a year. Supplies delivered included arms, ammunition, plastic explosives, radio sets, bicycles for transportation, bicycle tires, food, clothing and medical supplies. Specialty supplies included radio crystals, printer's ink, and for the Norwegians, skis and sleds. The bulk of supplies to the resistance in France were transported to them by 138 Squadron, with the B Flight of 161 Squadron doing agent and supply drops as well. Both squadrons depended on moonlight for visibility over the landing fields and drop zones. To receive the supplies the operator on the ground would wait at a designated field. When the aircraft was heard overhead the operator would flash a prearranged Morse code letter. The supply aircraft would flash a corresponding letter using its \\"downward identification light\\". The team on the ground would light the field, using five lights placed in an \\"X\\" pattern to mark the drop target. The aircraft came over the field at very low altitude, 400 to 500 feet, and reduced speed to just above stalling to minimize scatter and damage to the cargo. The operator would have arranged means to move the supplies off to places of concealment. Stores were usually parachuted in using cylindrical containers to protect the loads. C-type metal containers were 6 feet long and could weigh up to 250 pounds. This container could be used to carry longer loads such as rifles. The \\"H\\" type had been developed by the Poles. It was the same size overall, but could be broken down into five smaller sections to make it easier to carry away and conceal. Packages delivered, on the other hand, seldom weighed more than 100 pounds. Some materials such as boots and blankets were \\"free-dropped\\" by simply throwing them bundled together out of the aircraft, often to the hazard of any receiving committee on the ground. 20% of the drop missions were aborted, either because the reception committee was not there or the weather was too poor to find the drop field. High value items, such as forged documents and money, were often transported in with an agent, often by Lysander. A Stirling at dusk, December 1943 Harris did not approve of the use of aircraft for these purposes, and in particular complained that they did nothing for 2 weeks at a time during the dark period. This was not entirely true, as the long flights of their operations had a high maintenance requirement, and they did perform training work. Nevertheless, it seemed prudent to assist, and during the dark period some of 138s aircraft contributed in the bombing campaign over Germany. With target drop zones as far away as Poland and Yugoslavia, the missions flown tended to expose the crews to a great deal of time over enemy occupied territory. Due to this their first tour was completed with 250 hours of operational flight, if that were accumulated before the 30 sorties that was the normal for marking the completion of a first tour for Bomber Command crews. The needs for supplies increased as the circuits being supported grew larger and the time of the invasion approached. 138 Squadron's lift capacity was improved with the loan of Stirlings in December 1943. The loan became permanent in 1944 when the large bombers were released from the bombing campaign, and 138 Squadron converted from Halifaxes to Stirlings. =Parachute drops of agents= The majority of agents arrived in France by parachute drop. This was not a gentle daytime float from altitude. They were dropped at night over a reception field at 500 to 600 feet, just high enough for the parachute to open a few seconds before the agent hit the ground. Some 1,500 agents were dropped into France, and many of these did several drops. The aircrews generically called the agents \\"Joes\\", and for the most part did not get to know them. If the aircraft was a little too low it made for a rough landing, and a number of agents were injured. Over the course of the war 6 agents were killed from failed drops, the result of either the aircraft being too low or the chute failing to open. Agent drop operations almost always went off during the moon period, though occasionally \\"blind drops\\" were completed to empty fields in the dark period. Said 161 Squadron's B Flight commander Bob Hodges: \\"We sometimes dropped agents in the dark period with no moon, and these were often what we call blind drops. There was no reception committee on the ground and this method had security advantages, but there was always the risk of injury in the parachute landings.\\" =Pick-up flights= Pick-up operations were initially handled by the Lysander flight in 138 Squadron. After the split to form 161 Squadron the pick-ups were handled by 161's A Flight. Each planned pick-up operation was given an operational name, and the name was used until the mission had been completed. If the pick-up failed on the first attempt due to weather, subsequent efforts to make the same pick-up were put on under the same operational name. Occupied Zone and Free Zone of France, 1940-1942 By 1942 a routine had developed for putting together an operation. A resistance group would request a pick-up, choose a landing ground and provide a detailed description and map reference to London. The field would be photographed by the RAF's Photographic Reconnaissance Unit to allow the pilot to study the appearance of the proposed field. The pilot would then make up a route map to the target field by cutting a map of France into small folding sections that could be easily held in the pilot's hand. The route chosen was made up of a series of navigation pinpoints. The best navigational pinpoints were bodies of water, such as lakes, bends in a river, and so forth. Water reflected silver in the moonlight against the dark gray of the land, and made for the easiest terrain features to identify. During the flight the pilot would hold his folding map in one hand and the stick in the other. Over the course of the trip the pilot could ensure his progress by going folded section by section, point by point. The river Loire was a frequent guide. At a point along its course just east of Blois the river takes a sharp bend and two small islands are present. This easily identifiable terrain feature became a primary navigational point for operations deep into France. Upon leaving England a pilot would drop down to 500 feet over the channel to get under German radar. Crossing the French coastline was one of the more dangerous aspects of the trip, as German forces and anti-aircraft guns were present over much of the coastline opposite England. Cabourg was the favored spot to cross into the continent, as it avoided heavy anti-aircraft guns to the northeast at Le Havre and German army forces to the southwest at Caen. From Tangmere to Cabourg was about an hour's flight in a Lysander. Flying the single engine airplane over the cold waters of the English Channel at night was a test itself. Mechanical failure and a forced ditching in the sea was unlikely to end well. The ground crews knew this, and their Lysanders never suffered an engine failure. As the pilot approached the French coastline he would climb to 8,000 feet to get above the light flak found there, then drop down to 2,000 to 1,500 feet while flying across France for ease in reading the landmarks. If the sky was clear some pilots preferred to transit at 7,000 to 8,000 feet to avoid flak and conserve fuel, but the locations of flak were known, so this was less an issue after the coastline had been crossed. Once across the French coast the pilot would hold his map on his knee and fly the aircraft with his other hand, checking off his pinpoints as he moved inland. When the pilot got close to the target there would be a near pinpoint. Identifying it, he could make a calculation based on course direction and time of flight for when he would be over the field. As the aircraft approached the field the agent laying on the operation would signal a prearranged code letter in Morse. Operating his signal key, the pilot would flash back the agreed to Morse letter response via the plane's downward light. With the correct exchange of signals the operator and his men would light the flare path. The flare path was simply three flashlights staked out to poles. The operator and waiting passengers would be to the left of the \\"A\\" lamp at the base of the landing ground. 150 meters beyond it and into the wind was the \\"B\\" light. 50 meters to the right of the \\"B\\" lamp was the \\"C\\" lamp. The three lights formed an inverted \\"L\\". A group of 161 pilots stand before Verity's Lysander in 1943 (Jimmy McCairns, Hugh Verity, Charles Pickard, Peter Vaughan-Fowler, and Bunny Rymills) With the correct code letters exchanged the pilot would fly a circuit over the field and then bring the aircraft down to land, trying to touch down at \\"A\\". The Lysander's landing lights would be switched on just before landing so the pilot might be able to see obstructions. The pilot tried to touch down at the “A” lamp, and by applying hard brake usually had the aircraft stopped by the time it reached the B lamp. Turning about the \\"C\\" lamp, he would taxi back to the \\"A\\" lamp for the exchange. The passengers would clamber down the fixed ladder to the ground. The last passenger to disembark would hand off the luggage and take aboard the outgoing luggage before he climbed down the ladder himself. Then the outgoing passengers would climb aboard. The change over of passengers and load was completed in under three minutes. Often the operator would climb up to greet the pilot. There was a quick exchange of greetings and gifts, then full power with brake on till the tail lifted. With that it was off brake and airborne again in less than 150 yards. Though a brazenly bold undertaking, on occasion landings were made at abandoned French aerodromes that the Germans were not making use of. The Lysander pilots faced a number of dangers, including flak, German night fighters, Allied night fighters, the Gestapo, poor weather and mud. Of these, the most dangerous were poor weather and mud caked fields. German flak was concentrated along the coast, over towns and over German operated airfields. However, these locations were known to the pilots, so if a pilot plotted his course carefully and did not stray from it while flying the mission he should be able to avoid most if not all flak. German night fighters posed a threat, and there were interceptions. The night fighters were concentrated to the north over Belgium and in Germany, and presented a threat more to Halifax pilots flying to Poland then to Lysander pilots flying to Vichy France. A number of pilots and their passengers were lost in this way. In the early years Gestapo efforts to capture the fliers resulted a number of close calls. Being caught on the ground and subjected to interrogations by the Gestapo was always on the minds of the pilots as they orbited over a field and touched down. If an aircraft became stuck the plane had to be destroyed, and the pilot had to look for other means to get home. Usually this meant a long trek through the escape lines to southern France, over the Pyrenees and into Spain with hopes of reaching the British consulate and a flight home. When Robin Hooper's Lysander became trapped in mud in mid- November 1943, a Lysander recovery flight was launched during the next moon period to pick him up. This was carried out successfully on 17 December 1943 by Squadron Leader Bob Hodges. Hodges knew the forecast over England for the night was poor, and purposed an early flight to get back and down before the home airfields became shrouded in fog. An hour later heavy ground fog resulted in the loss of two Lysanders and three Halifaxes in the worst night of losses in the history of the Special Duties squadrons. A Hudson at Gibraltar To minimize the risk of capture while the plane was on the ground the job of dis- embarking and boarding passengers was choreographed and practiced, so that the time the Lysander was on the ground was kept to a minimum. The goal was to complete turnover in 3 minutes. Most pilots flew with a pistol as a personal sidearm, though the pistol was rarely put to use. Pilots also carried an escape kit, in case. A muddy field causing aircraft to become stuck, trapping the pilot on the ground was by far their worst fear. This occurred to pilots a number of times. The options were to try to get the aircraft unstuck or to burn the plane and try to escape out of France. When a plane became stuck the group on the ground were working against time to get it free and up in the air, as they had to get out of France before daylight and the Luftwaffe's morning patrols. If the flight was delayed too long an alternative route home was worked out by RAF Tempsford's CO, Mouse Fielden, who when he found himself delayed in the south of France took his Hudson out over the Mediterranean to the British airfield in Algiers at Maison Blanche. From there on the next day he flew to Gibraltar and then back to England. Flights at night to make pick- ups have largely been viewed as the more glamorous duty of the Special Duties squadrons, though at the time the pilots were rarely acknowledged publicly. The Lysanders they flew had been relegated to towing targets for firing practice or performing scouting flights as part of air/sea rescue operations. Thus if a pilot was seen by a fellow aviator climbing into a Lysander they tended to get a look of slight regard. Clearly they did not appear to be on the sharp end of the war effort. Regardless of public snubbing, morale among Lysander pilots was high, and they had a great deal of satisfaction for pulling agents out of Europe right under the nose of the Gestapo. After the D-Day landings in June 1944 the favored entry point was changed from Cabourg to south of the Cotentin peninsula to avoid Allied anti-aircraft fire and night fighters. Poor weather of either cloud or fog were the most prominent reasons for failing to complete a mission. The pilot might carry on and attempt to reach the objective, calculating his position from a last known navigational point. Using the aircraft's speed, time and direction, he might estimate when he would be over the general area of the target field by dead reckoning. However he would still need a break over the target field in order to see the reception committee light and the flare path for the landing. Formations =Flight 419 and Flight 1419= The first RAF special duties formation was Flight 419, officially formed 21 August 1940 and operating out of the fighter base at RAF North Weald. Flight Lt. Wallace Farley was the commanding officer of the flight, which comprised two Lysanders. Prior to Flight Lt. Wallace and immediately before the Flight was officially formed Acting Flight Lt John Coghlan was appointed to command it. He was lost whilst flying an agent into Belgium on the night of the 17/18th August and he was then replaced by Flight Lt Wallace three days later. The first commander of this, as yet, unnamed flight was John Coghlan. By September three Whitleys and another Lysander had been added to the flight. While Flight 419 was working up the first clandestine flight was flown by Wing Commander Andrew Geddes, who took an SIS agent to a field near Tours France on the night of 3 September 1940, flying a Lysander. This Lysander was part of an Army Cooperation unit. First mission An early Lysander in flight Flight 419's first mission was undertaken the night of 19/20 October 1940 when Flight Lt. Farley set out to pick-up SIS agent Philip Schneidau. Schneidau had parachuted into France ten days earlier on the night of October 9. Before he left Schneidau and Farley had worked out how he would be retrieved. As no small wireless sets were available at that time, he had brought along 10 messenger pigeons as the means to communicate back to England. The two had worked out a 3 light flare path pattern to guide the Lysander on its landing. The simple flare path remained in use for Lysander landings without modification throughout the rest of the war. Schneidau had also made a number of modifications to the Lysander, including the welding of a ladder to the side of the fuselage to make it easier for him to climb in, which was helpful, and the removal of the aircraft's rear canopy for the same reason, which was not. The plan was for Schneidau to be retrieved on the night of the 19th. On the night of his planned pick-up, heavy wind and rain resulted in all RAF operations being cancelled. Knowing Schneidau would be waiting for him, Farley convinced his CO to let him give it a try. Though taking off in a storm, the weather cleared some over France. Farley located Schneidau's field, landed and made the pick- up. On the way out a German sentry put a bullet into Farley's plane, which entered the cockpit, passed between Farley's legs and struck the compass, destroying it. As the two men began their flight back the storm worked up into a southwesterly gale, pushing them north and east. With rain and wind pouring into the open rear cockpit, the wireless set became inoperable and Schneidau was soaked through and increasingly cold. Making their way north through the storm, the two had no reference points to guide them and soon had no idea if they were over England, the North Sea or northern Germany. The pair flew on through the night, hoping for a break in the sky. Six hours later they were running out of fuel, still with no idea of where they were, when a small break in the cloud gave them a glimpse of a small plateau at the top of steep cliffs lining a rugged coastline. With no other option available they dropped down to make a landing and crashed through a group of anti-glider posts. They had crashed six miles north of RAF Oban in Scotland, 600 miles north of Farley's home base. The two men were spotted by a pair of Scottish guardsmen whom they could not understand. They brought them into their senior officer at the RAF coastal command base at Oban as suspected spies. The station commander inquired who they were and what they were doing there. Farley limited his answer to his name and service number. Schneidau said they had been doing a special recce over the Atlantic, but he was unable to give his name. Finding these answers entirely unsatisfactory, the base commander confined them. Meanwhile, Farley's commanding officer had been searching for them, looking for signs of a wreck along the cliffs of the coast of England. He was informed that a Lysander had crashed in northern Scotland, but dismissed the wreck as being too far away. When he was told the pilot's name was Farley, he realized his man had made it back. Thus began the covert activities of the RAF Special Duties squadrons. Administration The special duties service required its own administrative support. Ordinary administrative procedures useful in the arming and targeting of large numbers of aircraft for bombing raids as practised by the RAF were unsuitable for the work of secretly moving agents, arms, supplies and special funds by solitary flights to isolated fields in France. The formation was initially under the administrative control of No. 11 Group RAF. In September 419 Flight was bombed out of North Weald and moved to Stradishall. Administrative control switched to 3 Group Bomber Command, which provided administrative support to all Special Duties squadrons til the end of the war. Two Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys were added to the flight in September. Many of the early Whitley missions were flown to Poland. In February 1941 Flight 419 had its designation changed to No. 1419 Flight RAF to eliminate the confusion that had developed with No. 419 Squadron RAF. The flight was moved to Newmarket on 22 May 1941, and in September to Stapleford Tawney till October, when it was moved back to Stradishall. =No. 138 (Special Duties) Squadron= Insignia of 138 Squadron On 25 August 1941 Flight 1419 was expanded with the addition of 5 Whitleys and became 138 (Special Duties) Squadron. Throughout the conflict 138 Squadron did the bulk of the heavy lifting of supplies and agents to France and the other occupied countries in Europe. The squadron comprised 2 Lysanders, 10 Whitleys, 3 Halifaxes and a Martin Maryland. The Squadron operated during the moon periods, flying to remote fields where they did their drops. They had no special navigational aides. The aircraft observed strict wireless silence over hostile territory, and reached their target fields by navigation alone. The aircraft flew over the continent at about 2,000 feet to navigate to the target field, but would drop down to 400 to 500 feet as the aircraft approached the drop point and reduced air speed to just above stalling to minimize scatter and damage to the cargo. The drops had to be accurate to ensure the waiting resistance agents would be able to get the materials dropped and hide them away. Agents were dropped at 600 feet, barely enough time for the parachute to open and slow the fall of the agent. If the aircraft was a little too low it made for a very hard landing, and a number of agents were injured from hard landings. The Lysanders did the pick-up operations and made up their own B Flight in 138. In February 1942 the squadron split, with its Lysanders and a number of its Whitleys and Halifaxes combining with the King's Flight to form 161 Squadron. After the split the majority of supply drops and agent drops were still handled by 138 Squadron. 161 Squadron did all of the pick-ups of personnel, and also would land agents who lacked the training to parachute in or were physically unable to do so. A month later, in March 1942, the squadron was moved to the secret airfield at Tempsford, where it remained until the end of the war. A number of Polish pilots operated in 138 Squadron. In July 1943 the Polish pilots in 138 were formed into their own unit, Flight 301. By the end of the war 138 Squadron had flown more than 2,500 sorties, dropped 29,000 containers, 10,000 packages and 995 Joes into occupied Europe, while losing 70 aircraft. Over half of these missions were in Handley Page Halifax bombers, modified to provide a parachute hatch called the \\"Joe hole.\\" As the war was coming to a close 138 Squadron was converted into a regular line unit on 9 March 1945. The squadron's insignia was of a sword cutting through a rope bind, with the motto \\"For Freedom\\".Michie, Allan A. The \\"Scarlet Pimpernels\\" of the air Bedfordshire Times, November 1945 =No. 161 (Special Duties) Squadron= Insignia of 161 Squadron Captain John Giannaris, a Greek speaking US Army officer wounded leading a team of Greek resistance fighters, arrives from the field on a 148 (SD) Lysander. He survived. 161 (Special Duties) Squadron was formed at RAF Newmarket on 15 February 1942 from 138's Lysander flight and a flight of Whitleys and Wellingtons. These were combined with pilots and aircraft from the King's Flight to create the second SD squadron. The unit was commanded by Edward Fielden, an experienced pilot who had been the CO of the King's Flight. He inherited two very experienced officers in Guy Lockhart and “Sticky” Murphy from 138. 161's A Flight was made up of 6 Lysanders, with Guy Lockhart as its commanding officer. A Flight undertook the pick-up operations. The squadron's B Flight flew two-engine Whitleys and Wellingtons, and did agent parachute drops and supply drop missions. In November 1942 the B Flight's Whitleys were replaced with the four-engine Halifax. The squadron moved to RAF Tempsford in April 1942, which remained its home base for the duration of the war. When on operations during the full moon period the A Flight would move forward to RAF Tangmere. Tangmere is on the coast, 100 miles south of Tempsford. The move extended the reach of A Flight's Lysanders into Europe.Orchard, Adrian Group Captain Percy Charles “Pick” Pickard DSO, DFC 1915 - 1944 February 2006 161 Squadron would deliver SOE agents, wireless operators, wireless equipment and weapons to assist the resistance. Out of France they transported French political leaders, leaders of the resistance, and agents whose cover had been blown. Occasionally they gave a lift out to evading Allied airmen. They had the goal of making their pick-up operations as reliable as a London taxi service. The squadron also had the responsibility for operator training. Following a poorly directed and unnecessary pick-up in April 1942 the RAF insisted on tighter control of pick- up operations, and refused to perform pick-ups except with operators that 161's pilots had trained. The squadron's insignia was of a released shackle, with the motto \\"Liberate\\". =No. 148 (Special Duties) Squadron: Mediterranean= In 1943 a special duties squadron was created for operations in the Mediterranean. The unit was formed with the conversion of 148 Squadron to 148 (Special Duties) Squadron. The squadron was sent to Algiers to support an SOE unit, which was known as Interservice Signals Unit 6, codenamed 'Massingham'. The unit's Halifaxes dropped supplies to partisans in southern France, Italy and the Balkans. In February Peter Vaughan-Fowler was selected to command a flight of Lysanders to do agent pick-up operations to Greece, Yugoslavia and southern France. It participated in the Warsaw airlift, where it suffered heavy losses. The unit continued its work through the end of the war. =No. 357 (Special Duties) Squadron: Far East= In 1944 No. 357 (Special Duties) Squadron began operations in the Far East, flying Liberators, Dakotas, Lysanders and Catalina Flying Boats in support of SOE's Force 136 in Burma and other resistance groups in Thailand and Malaya. 357 (Special Duties) Squadron dropped more supplies by unit weight in the Far East than any other RAF unit dropped in weight of bombs. Airfields =RAF Tempsford= Hangars and temporary huts in the southeast corner of RAF Tempsford, 1943 The airfield at Tempsford was located in a relatively remote part of the Bedfordshire countryside. It was built on the land of the Gibraltar Farm, which was situated across a low bog. The airfield was developed in 1940 under the specifications of an \\"A\\" class airfield, though it was kept clandestine. The locals knew there was an RAF station down a little side-road marked “This road is closed to the public”, but they knew little else. Since the flights were all undertaken at night, the local farmers saw very little of the aircraft that operated out of Tempsford. Built over a bog, this became telling later when fog proved a recurring significant hazard to landing aircraft. The airfield lay largely dormant until the arrival of the SD squadrons in 1942. 138 Squadron moved to Tempsford 11 March 1942. 161 Squadron followed 10 April 1942. The first covert supply mission flown from Tempsford was carried out by 138 Squadron in the March moon period to a drop zone in northern France, 18 March 1942. Underdeveloped, Tempsford was not a typical RAF airfield. It did have the standard three runways laid out at 60 degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern, and a perimeter track which circled the field's dispersals. Hugh Verity, the former commanding officer of 161 Squadron's A Flight, described it as \\"not much of an RAF station.\\" RAF Tempsford was designed to look like an ordinary working farm. SOE agents were lodged in a local hotel before being brought to Tempsford's farm buildings. No one was allowed to see, let alone speak to, the agents being ferried to France. One of the buildings was brick built, but had wood siding framed around the structure to disguise it. This structure was commonly referred to as the Gibraltar Farm. It was very unusual for any structure to be standing within the perimeter track of an RAF airfield, but at Tempsford the Gibraltar Farm and a number of other farm buildings were located there. After final briefings and checks at the farm, the agents were issued firearms in the barn, and then boarded onto an awaiting aircraft flown by one of a team of pilots. Though keen to discover the source of the SD flights, the Germans were never able to determine where the Special squadrons were based, though twice a German agent was picked up lurking about near the airfield. =RAF Tangmere= A Spitfire stands amidst the midday rain and fog of RAF Tangmere, winter 1940 RAF Tangmere was 100 miles south of RAF Tempsford, on the southern coast of England. It was primarily a fighter squadron base, but during the moon periods the Lysanders and their ground crews would come down to Tangmere. This placed them closer to the target field and allowed the Lysanders to extend their range over France. For much of its wartime life two Spitfire squadrons were based at Tangmere. As such Tangmere airfield attracted the attention of the Luftwaffe. After Flight 419's second successful pick-up operation Gordon Scotter returned to Tangmere to find the airfield under attack. He was obliged to orbit about while the attack was in progress, and received the ire of the base commander when he brought his Lysander in without lights after the German attack was over. When at Tangmere the Lysanders were parked off by themselves. The pilots were billeted and did their flight planning at a local home known as the Tangmere Cottage. The cottage was partially hidden from view by large hedges that had been allowed to grow up. Located opposite the main entrance to the base, Tangmere Cottage was also used by the SOE to do final checks on the outgoing agents, and to give returning agents a meal prior to taking them to London for debriefing. During the day the Lysander pilots would cross the field and take meals at the normal RAF officer's mess. The 161 pilots would fly out to Tangmere two weeks at a time during the \\"moon period\\", which was a week before and a week after the full moon. The cover story for the Lysanders given to the RAF squadrons stationed at Tangmere was that the planes were used to do \\"photographic reconnaissance by night, using special flash flares\\". The torpedo like extra fuel cylinder slung in-between the wheels of the undercarriage was said to contain special nighttime cameras. Jimmy McCairns, a Lysander pilot with 161, had accepted this story without a thought earlier in his career when he was stationed at Tangmere while flying Spitfires with Douglas Bader's 601 Squadron. Fog over England was a major hazard when attempting to locate and set down on their return flights. More special duties aircrew lives were lost from aircraft accidents due to fog over England than to any other reason. On the night of 16/17 December 1943 poor weather caused five of the Tempsford SD aircraft to be lost. 138 Squadron lost three of its Halifaxes. One was lost over the sea, one crash landed along the coast, and the crew of the third, unable to land their plane, bailed out. On the same night fog claimed two of 161 Squadron's Lysanders. Though Lysander pilots had parachutes, the passengers they were carrying did not. If they were carrying passengers the pilots were committed to trying to land the aircraft. One crashed short of the field while trying to set down at RAF Tangmere. The pilot was trapped in the aircraft when it started to burn, but his two passengers were able to get free and survived. The other had been diverted from Tangmere to nearby RAF Ford, but the pilot had become disoriented in the fog and crashed into a hillside. There were no survivors from this flight. Aircraft =Armstrong Whitworth Whitley= A Whitley warms its engines prior to a mission The Whitley was the work horse aircraft used on special duties missions for the first two years of their operations. The two-engine bomber was introduced to the service in 1937. It had a crew of five and a lift capacity of 7,000 pounds. From its conception the Whitley was intended for night operations. For special duties work the aircraft was modified by having a drop hatch, or “Joe hole”, cut into the bottom of the fuselage to allow for easy disembarkation. The Whitley was famous for carrying the paratroopers who pulled off the Bruneval raid. Though an older design, over 1,000 Whitleys were produced after the start of the war. Whitleys were used as cargo carriers and agent drop aircraft in 138 Squadron and the B Flight of 161 Squadron. 138 Squadron operated the Whitley until November 1942 when they were replaced by the four-engined Halifax bomber. =Westland Lysander= Westland Lysander Mk III (SD) Throughout the war the Lysander was the principal aircraft used for pick-ups. The Lysander had been developed as an Army co-operation aircraft, intended to act as a spotter aircraft for artillery and to shuttle personal as a liaison aircraft. In daylight service in France 1940 Lysanders were lost at an alarming rate. Their slow speed resulted in very low survive-ability in contested air space. Of the 178 Lysanders sent to France 118 were destroyed, and the type was soon retired from this role. However, the aircraft's exceptional short-field performance made it the ideal aircraft for covert ops and it was soon put to use in this role. The Lysander was ideal for landing on small, unimproved airstrips behind enemy lines. It was equipped with automatic slats which extended down when the aircraft was at low speeds to increase lift and lower its stall speed. The aircraft was modified for its SD missions. The small standard bomb racks and forward firing machine guns, mounted to each wheel fairing, were removed. The rear firing machine gun for the observer/spotter was also removed. The aircraft's range was extended by adding a 150-gallon auxiliary fuel tank underneath the fuselage, which increased its round trip range from 600 miles to 1,150 miles. The rather large service radio was replaced with a much smaller one, and a rearward facing bench for 2 passengers was installed in the observer compartment with a stowage locker underneath. At the rear of the aircraft a shelf was built which also served as an additional seat, and a ladder was affixed to the left side of the fuselage. The peak year of activity for the Lysanders was 1943, when the Moon Squadrons made 125 landings in France. =Lockheed Hudson= When the number of people needed to be picked up was more than three 161 Squadron would send two Lysanders in missions they called \\"a double.\\" The two aircraft were to coordinate their landings to minimize time on the ground and the risk of German intervention. This was difficult to do, as an aircraft in the dark of night was very hard to find, and radio transmissions brought their own risks. Consideration was given to making use of a larger aircraft. Sticky Murphy had already done a pick up using an Anson borrowed from a training unit, but the type was deemed underpowered and inappropriate for pick-ups. The squadron also had available a Lockheed Hudson brought over from the King's Flight. This proved to be an effective aircraft. A Hudson in flight The twin-engined aircraft had a range greater than the Lysander, and was faster. Its three-man crew included a navigator and a wireless operator, taking the burden of navigation off the shoulders of the pilot. Most importantly, it had the capacity to carry ten passengers, instead of the Lysander's three. On the down side the Hudson's greater weight and higher stall speed required a longer field to land on. The use of the Hudson for pick-up operations missions was developed by Charles Pickard and Hugh Verity. By trial flights Pickard learned that the Hudson's stall speed was actually some 20 mph slower than what was stated in the plane's manual. Pickard showed Verity how to land a Hudson short, and together they worked out the operating procedures that enabled this twin-engined aircraft to operate to fields in occupied France. This gave the squadron the ability to carry in and bring out groups of as many as ten people in one mission using a single aircraft. The Hudson was three times the weight of the Lysander, and required three times the length to land. To accommodate this, the flare path was extended to 450 yards by adding two lamps. The 5 lights were spaced out, with the A, B, C and D lamps 150 yards from each other, and with the E lamp 50 yards to the right of D. The first Hudson operation was completed the night of 13/14 February by Wing Commander Pickard, flying five agents into a field near the River Loire. =Handley Page Halifax= Halifax in daylight flight, 1942 The Handley Page Halifax was a four engine bomber with a lifting load capacity of 13,000 lb. It had nearly twice the capacity of the Whitley. The Halifax replaced the Whitley in the special duties squadrons in late 1942. Used for parachuting supplies and agents, the Halifax had a much better range than the Whitley and was at a distinct advantage in long missions to Poland and the Balkans. The SD Halifaxes were modified to carry metal supply containers. The C-type metal containers were 6 feet long and weighed 250 pounds. Halifaxes could carry 15 of the C-type metal containers, whereas the Whitleys they replaced were limited to 12. The Halifax worked as the primary supply transport aircraft of the SD squadrons from late 1942 through mid 1944, when they were superseded by the Stirling. =Short Stirling= An enormous Stirling is loaded with bombs prior to its use with the SD squadrons By mid 1943 the Short Stirling became available on loan from Bomber Command for service with the Special Duties squadrons. The Stirling was a large aircraft, designed in the late 1930s as the heavy bomber by which Bomber Command would conduct strategic bombing. From conception it was designed as a 4 engine bomber, and was huge. It had the capacity to lift 14,000 pounds. Though heavy and relatively underpowered, Stirlings had excellent low and medium altitude performance, were extremely maneuverable for a large plane and had a range of 3,000 miles. By the time they were in use with Special Duties the big plane's problems with its undercarriage collapsing had largely been worked out. The Stirlings could carry 20 C-type metal supply containers, 33% more than the Halifax. This aircraft became available for full-time use with the special duties squadrons in May 1944, and they began re-equipping with them. By the end of the year it had replaced the Halifax. =Douglas Dakota= The SOE used the American- supplied Douglas Dakota late in the war. It was often landed in southern France and at airfields in territory held by partisans in the Balkans. Summation RAF SD Dakotas over the Adriatic The SD pilots and aircrew received little recognition for the work they did, and certainly not at the time they were doing it. But the men that made up the special duties air units were a breed apart. As pilots they tended to be self-sufficient, able to problem solve and act on their own. Though excellent pilots and natural navigators, Hugh Verity offered that many would not have been as well suited to regular RAF officer duties. The pilots had to possess a certain intangible quality. The life of the special operations airman was that of the lone wolf. By the end of 1941 138 Squadron had moved 37 agents to France while picking up 5. 55% of their missions failed due to either bad weather or failure to make contact with the reception operator. Over the course of 1942 the two SD squadrons, 138 Squadron and 161 Squadron, had ferried to France 23 tons of supplies and 155 agents, while picking up 19. 1943 saw the SD squadrons fly 625 sorties, deliver 589 tons of supplies and carry 102 agents to France while taking out 223. By the time the SD squadrons disbanded they had flown over 13,500 sorties and brought in over 10,000 tons of supplies, 60% of these supplies delivered after the invasion at Normandy. They had parachuted in 1,800 agents and brought another 324 in by Lysander or Hudson. They had also picked up 593 politicos, French resistance agents, family members, and the odd evading RAF or USAAF airman, and brought them back to England. As for the SOE itself, the organisation was dissolved six months after the end of the war, 15 January 1946. An example of the effort given by the special duties units is the pick-up operation undertaken the night of 26/27 January 1943. René Massigli was a valued French political leader attempting to reach Charles de Gaulle in England. He had been held up by poor weather since November. It was for this reason that 161 Squadron commander Charles Pickard took up the mission himself. Taking one agent out with him in foul wintry weather, he traveled over a cloud covered France guided largely by dead reckoning and reached the target field area. Pickard was a doggedly determined aviator. Unable to see the reception committee's light, he continued to circle for two hours as his fuel level approached critical for his return flight. Finally a small break in the cloud gave him a glimpse of the signal light. He dropped through the cloud and quickly set down. Gauging his chances, Pickard gambled on a return flight to the nearest British airfield, RAF Predannack. As he made his way back he cleared France and most of the Channel, but as he approached the airfield at 3,000 feet his luck and his fuel ran out. Without power, he brought the Hudson in on a dead-stick landing, delivering his charges safely. In three weeks Pickard would fly the pick-up operation that would earn him his third DSO. A year after that he lost his life leading the Amien's prison raid. Learning of his death, Massigli offered this tribute to Pickard and the special duties units he was a part of: > \\"As one of the many Frenchman whom the RAF pilots helped to escape from > France in the recent years of affliction, may I be allowed to pay to Group > Captain Pickard my tribute of admiration, gratitude and regret? The time has > not yet come when it will be possible to reveal to the full what British > airmen did in helping Resisting France. So much courage was demanded of > them, so much ability and endurance when, on a moonlit night, they had to > discover, somewhere in the French countryside, the field or glade that was > ‘Target for tonight’. Among these admirable men, Group Captain Pickard was > one of the greatest.

Among the > brave country folk who had escorted me to a field there was one, probably > the best and the youngest, who was to lose his life last August on a maquis > battlefield.

It is native to Western Europe and North Africa but uncommon in Britain. Description This cricket is a small, dark brown, ground-dwelling, grasshopper-like insect with long, thread-like antennae. It grows to about . Neither males nor females have hind wings; in males the fore- wings extend half way along the abdomen, while in females, the fore-wings are reduced to rounded stubs. Females also have a long ovipositor at the tip of the abdomen. Distribution and habitat The wood cricket is native to Europe and North Africa. Its range includes Western, Central and Southern Europe, Corsica, Algeria and Morocco. The natural habitat of this species is forest edges and woodland clearings, where it is associated with oak, beech, hazel and holly trees and with bracken. It thrives among the leaf litter in warm, sunny spots. It is uncommon in Britain, with separate populations in the New Forest, the Isle of Wight and southern Devon. In 2001, following the clearance of coniferous woodland and rhododendron from a site near Offwell in eastern Devon, a new population appeared; the nearest previously known population had been around Harpford, some away. Male wood cricket Ecology Wood crickets live among the decaying leaf litter on which they feed. They may also consume the fungus growing among the litter. When the weather is hot enough, males stridulate (sing) during both day and night. The loud two tone call is difficult to pinpoint, especially when several are calling in close proximity. When disturbed, these crickets leap away with their powerful back limbs, or hide in the leaf litter or among low vegetation. Eggs are laid in the leaf litter in summer and autumn and the crickets overwinter as eggs or as nymphs, with the young maturing in June. Unusually for insects in the grasshopper family, wood crickets survive for two years. Being flightless, these crickets are limited in their dispersal abilities; males have been found to disperse over from the woodland edge but females and nymphs did not move nearly so far. Dispersal along the edge of woodland is more possible.

In the first round he received just 13.5% of votes (third place) and did not pass on to the second round. Despite this he would later go on to describe this campaign as a tipping point in his life. =2008 Municipal Elections= A year later, Gilles Simeoni placed second in the first round of the 2008 Bastia municipal elections, having received 14.91% of the vote. This was 5 points more than predicted by voter intention surveys and allowed him to proceed to the second round.

Within his district he outperformed predictions by coming in second to the Union for a Popular Movement's Sauveur Gandolfi-Scheit ahead of the Radical Party of the Left's Jean Zuccarelli. On a municipal level, Simeoni's party received around a thousand more votes than they had during the 2010 elections while the Radical Party of the Left saw a decline of around 250. This was a confirmation of the narrowing gap between the two parties and gave credence to the thought of an eventual victory for Simeoni and Pe a Corsica in the 2014 municipal elections. =2014 Municipal Elections and Mayor of Bastia= In the first round of the March 2014 Municipal Elections Simeoni's party received 32.32% of the vote. In the second round he picked up votes from the Union for a Popular Movement's Jean-Louis Milani and the Radical Party of the Left's François Tatti, leaving him with 55.40% of the total. The next month on the fifth of April he became the first nationalist mayor of Bastia, ending the dual reign of French Communist Party and the Radical Party of the Left who had been in control of the town since 1968. This outcome was the result of the nationalist's new electoral strategy that Gilles Simeoni had helped to design. This strategy privileged pragmatic alliances so that they could bring their ideas closer to the center of Corsican politics. =2015 Municipal Elections= During the March 2015 Departmental Elections, the municipal alliance of Bastia ran pairs of candidates in the four cantons totally or partially within the City of Bastia. They had success in three out of four cantons which further proved that Simeoni's strategy was working. However his ally Fraçois Tatti was seen celebrating the victory of François Orlandi an ally of Paul Giacobbi. Tatti's actions led Simeoni, Jean-Louis Milani and Emanuelle de Gentili (who was Tatti's former running mate) to call for his resignation. This signaled the beginning of the campaign for the 2015 Regional Elections in which the nationalists hoped to confront Giacobbi.

After the First World War the regimental headquarters moved to Aylesbury and, by the 1960s, the Hunter Street area became very dilapidated.

Members and supporters have been linked to right-wing terrorism and vigilantism, and members have been arrested with weapons and on terrorism-related charges. Experts who have studied the group say it appears to be \\"committed to violence\\". The group rose to prominence as an anti-Islam group in 2015, and shifted more towards anti-immigration in response to public sentiment and police crackdowns. History =2014: Bendigo mosque protests= Beginning in 2014, members of what would become the True Blue Crew were involved in the \\"Voices of Bendigo\\" and \\"Stop the Mosques\\" Bendigo protests. A number of far- right groups, including the Q Society, Reclaim Australia, the Australian Defence League and the United Patriots Front opposed the construction of a mosque and Islamic community centre in Bendigo, Victoria. The True Blue Crew was formed in 2015 as a splinter group from the anti-Islamic Reclaim Australia group, along with a number of small far-right nationalist groups such as the United Patriots Front. =2016: Melton mosque protests= In May 2016, the group attended an anti-mosque protest in Melton along with members of the United Patriots Front and the Love Australia or Leave Party. About 150 people attended, opposing a housing development which they falsely claimed was being built for Muslims only. As the crowd dispersed following a similar protest in August the same year, fighting broke out between members of the True Blue Crew and anti-Muslim vigilante group the Sons of Odin. =2018: Vigilantism= In January 2018, United Patriots Front and True Blue Crew were reported by Channel 7 news to be attempting to arrange vigilante patrols to monitor young African Australian men. The report led to accusations that Channel 7 were giving neo-Nazis a speech platform. Links to terrorism and violence On 25 June 2016, police seized weapons including a knife and knuckle duster during an \\"Australian Pride\\" rally. In August 2016, a member of True Blue Crew, Phillip Galea, was charged with terrorism-related offences. Police investigators said that Galea was linked to several far-right groups including Reclaim Australia, United Patriots Front, True Blue Crew and the openly neo- Nazi group Combat 18. Galea was accused of ordering ingredients for explosives and video footage seized in raids showed Galea carrying out reconnaissance of a target, the documents allege. His intended targets were various \\"leftist\\" organisations in Melbourne, including Trades Hall in Carlton, the Melbourne Anarchist Club in Northcote and the Resistance Centre in the Melbourne CBD. Police stated that “Galea outlined his intentions were to cause as much devastation to these locations as possible in a team coordinated attack, using smoke bombs and improvised explosive devices”. The Court was told that his aims were to eliminate the leaders of the left in Melbourne, blaming them for the \\"Islamisation\\" of Australia. Galea was accused of researching homemade bombs, ballistic armour and guns, and preparing a terrorist document entitled “Patriot’s Cookbook”, intended to be a how-to-guide for far-right terrorists. Galea was convicted in December 2019 of plotting terrorist attacks and creating a document likely to facilitate a terrorist act. He is due for sentencing in March 2020. =Links to Christchurch mosque shooter= In the wake of the Christchurch mosque shootings in March 2019, it emerged that the alleged perpetrator, Brenton Tarrant, had three years earlier given fulsome praise to Blair Cottrell as a leader of the far-right movements on social media. He made more than 30 comments on the now deleted UPF and TBC Facebook pages, singling out Cottrell for praise and disparaging Neil Erikson and Shermon Burgess as \\"useful idiots\\". The group was banned from Facebook after posting Islamophobic messages in the wake of the Christchurch massacre. Political links Members of TBC have been linked to One Nation candidate Nikhil Reddy, with members of both groups volunteering for one another.

It is a dicot.  Description  Cuscuta gronovii belongs to the family Convolvuaceae, including the morning glories, comprising about 200 species. It is a parasitic annual vine that infects host plants in a parasitic relationship. Its stems appear orange-yellow in color. The vine can grow up to a length of one meter or more, entangling itself around the host plant. Although it appears to be leafless, it has tiny, alternate, scale-like leaves. The vine produces white flowers with bell-shaped, five-lobed corollas, and sepals united at the base. The flowers are roughly 1/8 of an inch apart from one another. There are currently four known subspecies of Cuscuta gronovii: calyptrata, gronovii, laterifola, saururi.  Etymology  Cuscuta gronovii was named in honor of botanist Jay Fredrik Gronon. The genus Cuscuta was named after the Arabic word for \\"dodders\\", and the word dodder originates from an Old English word meaning \\"todder\\". There are four widely used common names for this species: common dodder, scaldweed, swamp dodder, and love dodder.  Distribution and ecology  The common dodder can be found in every state of the United States with the exceptions of Utah, Nevada, California, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii. It can also be found in all provinces of Canada with the exceptions of British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. The plant is native in all of these areas. This species has naturalized in France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Italy. This species is commonly found growing in temperate forest habitats. Because it requires an abundance of moisture, the common dodder is usually found in floodplains.  Life cycle  Plants within the genus Cuscuta generally do not contain chlorophyll, nor are they photosynthetically active. This species, however, does contain a small amount of chlorophyll. It is not enough to support the plant via autotrophy alone. This is why the common dodder is dependent upon other plants to survive. The life cycle begins with germination, but seeds are unable to survive long periods of time without first associating themselves with host plants. Adult plants wind themselves around their host and begin the attachment phase. Parenchymal cells begin pre-haustoria development. The next phase is referred to as the penetration phase, where the host plant is punctured through by a fully developed haustoria. This process allows for water and macromolecules to be transferred from the host to the plant. While this can be harmful for the host plant, the effects are generally not fatal. Common host plants for this species include, but are not limited to, the spotted touch-me-not, false nettle, wood nettle, square-stemmed monkeyflower, and ditch stonecrop. The plant flowers between July and October. It is pollinated by wasps.

Battle of Vingeanne Battle of Vingeanne July 52 BC In July 52 BC the Roman general Julius Caesar fought an important battle of the Gallic Wars against a coalition of Gauls led by Vercingetorix. Caesar responded to an attack against Gallia Narbonensis by leading his forces east through Lingones territory towards Sequani territory, probably marching down the Vingeanne valley. He had recently recruited (or hired) German cavalry, and they would prove decisive. The Gallic army held a very strong position guarded by high slopes, easy to defend. It was protected by the Vingeanne on the right, and the Badin, a small tributary of the Vingeanne, on its front. In the space between these two streams and the road from Dijon to Langres was an area across, slightly uneven in some parts, almost flat everywhere else, mainly between the Vingeanne and the hillock of Montsuageon. Near the road, and to the west, rise hills which dominated the ground, as well as the whole country, up to the Badin and the Vingeanne. The Gauls thought the Romans were retreating towards Italy and decided to attack. One group of Gallic cavalry blocked the Roman advance while two groups of cavalry harried the Roman's flanks. After hard fighting, the German cavalry broke the Gallic cavalry on the right and chased them back to the main Gallic infantry force. The remaining Gallic cavalry fled, and Vercingetorix was forced to retreat to Alesia, where he was besieged by the Romans. The Battle of Alesia decided the war in the Romans' favor. Lait Pur Sterilisé de la Vingeanne 'Lait Pur Sterilise de la Vingeanne by Théophile Steinlen The Quillot Brothers had a dairy in the village of Montigny sur Vingeanne where they produced sterilized milk. In 1897 they commissioned the Swiss artist Théophile Steinlen (1859–1923) to produce a poster advertising their product. The result was an endearing poster that shows the artist's daughter Colette tasting a bowl of milk before giving it to the family cats, who are waiting expectantly. Steinlen was a prolific artist, but this early work is his most successful poster. Canal Rue du Moulin bridge over the canal at Cheuge. The river is about from the canal here. The river at Villegusien-le-Lac The Canal entre Champagne et Bourgogne, crosses the Langres plateau watershed between the Marne to the northwest and the Saône to the southeast. Much of the route on the Saône side is along the Vingeanne valley. A barge travelling from the Saône up to the Langres plateau travels and passes 43 locks with a total rise of . The canal crosses the watershed through the Balesmes tunnel at an elevation of . From there it travels down to the navigable part of the Marne, and passes 71 locks with a total drop of . A dependable supply of water is needed to replace the of water lost when a lock is operated and losses from leaking lock gates and other causes. The Langres plateau has of annual rainfall, and can supply sufficient water, but seasonal variations in the flow of the Marne and the Vingeanne make the water supply in summer unreliable. Reservoirs are needed to ensure a reliable supply year round. This was recognized by Roger de Fontenay in his 1781 plan for the canal, and again by Brière de Montidour, chief engineer of the Corps des Ponts et Chaussées, in 1835. The canal designers planned four reservoirs, three on the Marne side and the Lac de Villegusien on the Vingeanne. Lac de Villegusien The Lac de Villegusien, or Réservoir de la Vingeanne, is in the upper valley of the Vingeanne about from its source. The reservoir is below the upper reach of the canal in the Balesmes tunnel, which is supplied by the higher Lac de la Liez. The cement-covered dyke of compacted clay-sand soil was built on the Vingeanne between 1902 and 1904, and was the longest in Europe at the time. The reservoir was put into operation in the winter of 1905-06, and the canal was opened for navigation in early 1907. The reservoir covers and has a capacity of . There are two intake turrets, which may send some of the water to the Moulin de Villegusien.

It was described as a new species in 2006. It is considered vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN. Taxonomy and etymology The Phou Khao Khouay leaf-nosed bat was described as a new species in 2006, based on specimens collected in central Laos in 1997 and 1998. The authors of the 2006 paper placed it in the bicolor species group of the genus Hipposideros. Its species name \\"khaokhouayensis\\" is a New Latin derivative of Phou Khao Khouay, the conservation area where this species was discovered. The authors selected this name \\"to bring attention to the potential importance of the National Biodiversity Conservation Areas network for preserving natural areas in Lao PDR, as they contain highly distinctive ecosystems, hosting many endemic species such as this one.\\" Its closest relative is the Laotian roundleaf bat; the two species have a genetic distance of 3.91-4.12%. Description When it was first encountered, researchers thought that it was the Laotian roundleaf bat, Hipposideros rotalis, as the two species are similar in appearance. The bats they found, however, were echolocating at a frequency 20 kHz above that of H. rotalis, utilizing frequencies of 87-91 kHz. In addition to its echolocation, the Phou Khao Khouay leaf-nosed bat has a smaller nose-leaf than H. rotalis. Its forearm is long; its tail is long; its ear is long. It weighs , making it a moderate-sized species of the bicolor species group. The fur on its back is long and brown; individual hairs are tricolored, with white bases, dark brown middles, and light brown tips. Fur on its belly is lighter in color than the fur on its back. Its ears are long and broad with blunt tips; they are brown in color. Biology Not much is known about its biology or reproduction. While females have been encountered in February, May, and June, no pregnant females have been observed. One female captured in May and another captured in June were lactating, though. This species has a pair of pubic nipples in addition to its pair of thoracic nipples, a feature found in all species of the following families: Craseonycteridae, Rhinopomatidae, Megadermatidae, Rhinolophidae, and Hipposideridae. The function of the pubic nipples could be to allow the pups to cling more securely to their mothers before they are able to fly. Pubic nipples could also function in feeding the pup. Range and habitat This species was first discovered in Phou Khao Khouay National Biodiversity Conservation Area. It has been captured at elevations ranging from above sea level. It has also been found near Vang Vieng, also in central Laos. It has been documented in both disturbed and intact evergreen forests. Conservation It is currently evaluated as vulnerable by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because its extent of occurrence is likely less than , it has been documented in only two locations, and its habitat is experiencing a decline in extent and quality. Even though it occurs in a protected conservation area in Laos, its habitat is still threatened due to lax enforcement of conservation laws. Phou Khao Khouay habitat is threatened by deforestation and the construction of roads and buildings.

Cumming has said that, disillusioned with TV, he was considering moving back into more fine-art oriented work until he met Chris Morris: “What Chris did was reassure me there was a way of making something on television that had wider merit. That restored my faith in television”. After Brass Eye, he worked for many years with comedian Mark Thomas, directing five series of his Mark Thomas Product series. Cumming worked with Matt Lucas & David Williams, directing their BBC series Rock Profile as well as directing specials for Bremner, Bird and Fortune, Jack Dee and Kevin Eldon.

Uoo has exhibited at 47 Canal in New York, Galerie Buchholz in Berlin, Germany, and Mendes Wood in São Paulo, Brazil, amongst other galleries. Uoo is the host of It's Gets Better, an art-performance event held every summer that showcases artists, musicians, poets, and fashion icons. Uoo lives and works in New York City.  Early life and education  Uoo was born and raised in California. Uoo graduated from California College of Arts in 2007 and went on to attend the Städelschule in Frankfurt, Germany.  Work  Titled Life is Juicy, Uoo's first solo New York exhibition opened at 47 Canal in 2012. The exhibition included three of the artist's signature cyborg mannequins cast in polyurethane resin and woven through with barbed wire and various electronics. The sculptures typically wear clothing worn down by the weather that the artist puts on their roof. Additionally, the exhibition included a video work and several pencil drawings. In 2014, Uoo had his first exhibition at Galerie Daniel Buchholz in Berlin, Germany, titled No Tears in Rain. The exhibition presented new work by Uoo: security gate sculptures altered with silicone, paint, tufts of human hair and rust. The gates were shown alongside fashion editorial-inspired photographs by Heji Shin and featured DeSe Escobar, Juliana Huxtable, and Eliot Glass. In 2015, Uoo was selected for the Forbes 30 Under 30 list. His first show in Brazil opened at Mendes Wood in São Paulo. The show was titled Viva La Juicy. Claire Rigby of ArtReview wrote of the show, \\"There's a moving ruined elegance to the paper objects, in their careful preconstruction of an imagined future world, hacked, garbled artefacts and all, that seems to signal the way forward to something potentially important.\\" In 2016, the artist received institutional recognition with appearances in MoMA PS1's Greater New York and Human Interest: Portraits of the Whitney’s Collection at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Later that year, Uoo held a two-person exhibition with mentor Franklin Williams, titled Curtains, at Canal 47. The exhibition included several of Williams' soft sculptures, called moments, that, \\"often abstract (and obsess over) an idiosyncratic, near-alien biology into a flat, pop symbolism with a spindly, almost arachnid complexity.\\" Alongside Williams' sculptures, Uoo presented similar collaged curtain works made from various sweaters and sweatpants, fleeces, fatigues, and polos. Side-by-side, the works by both artists are difficult to tell apart. The exhibition also included photographs of musician and performer Contessa Stuto as a gallery assistant. The exhibition's press release was written by Stuto and further blurred the lines of artist, artwork, and gallery. Uoo was selected to participate in 9th Berlin Biennale curated by art collective DIS. The Biennale explored a range of contemporary topics including advertising, digital technology, and the Internet. In late 2017, Uoo had a second solo-exhibition at Canal 47, titled Handmade Paper. The show included several works of handmade paper using a number of materials such as designer shopping bags, cotton, flies, dust, synthetic fibers, and cockroaches. Two cyborg mannequin sculptures were included in the show. Uoo organizes an annual performance-based event each summer titled It's Gets Better. First staged at Artists Space, New York, the performances have included a range of artists including K8 Hardy, Juliana Huxtable, Jacolby Satterwhite, Ryan Trecartin, and various members from House of Ladosha. = Themes and style = Kat Herriman of Cultured Magazine writes that Uoo's, \\"dystopian sculptures and videos offer a humorous take on contemporary issues,\\" specifically aspects of gender, sexuality, technology, and identity. Uoo often works with sculpture and video and typically includes collaborative photograph works alongside each of his shows. Cassie Packard of Hyperallergic writes of Uoo's photographs, \\"The manner in which identity is some open-ended combination of gender performance, advertising theatrics, and artificial appendages feels uncomplicated, which may be Uoo's point. A couple of decades on, Judith Butler's Gender Trouble isn't as troubling as it used to be; with networks, branding, and affective labor everywhere we look, most representations of identity we encounter are to some degree dialogic, performed, and enhanced.\\"  Exhibitions  = Solo exhibitions = * Handmade Paper, 47 Canal, New York, NY, 2017 * Curtains, 47 Canal, New York, 2016 * Viva La Juicy, Mendes Wood DM, Sāo Paulo, Brazil, 2015 * No Tears in Rain, Galerie Daniel Buchholz, Berlin, 2014 * Life is Juicy, 47 Canal, New York, NY 2012 = Two-person exhibitions = * Outside Inside Sensibility (with Jana Euler), curated by Jay Sanders, The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY, 2013 = Selected group exhibitions = * Teenscape, Schloss, 2017 * After Us, K11 Art Foundation, 2017 * High Anxiety, Rubell Family Collection, Miami, FL, 2016 * Streams of Warm Impermanence, David Roberts Art Foundation, 2016 * Baby I'm a Star, Romeo, 2016 * Good Dreams, Bad Dreams – American Mythologies, Aïshti Foundation, 2016 * All Around Amateur, Bergen Kunsthall, 2016 * Human Interest: Portraits from the Whitney's Collection, Whitney Museum of American Art, 2017 * Its Better for Sunday Sessions, MoMA PS1, 2016 * Greater New York, MoMA PS1, 2015 * Grand Opening Reception, km temporaer, 2015 * Mirror Effect, The BOX Gallery, 2015 * Artists' Film Club: Breaking Joints: Part 1, ICA London, 2015 * Looks, ICA, 2015 * Inhuman, Fridericianum, 2015 * An Interior That Remains an Exterior?, Kunstlerhaus, Halle fur Kunst & Medien, 2015 * Scan Scroll Surf: Frames and Windows, Mumok, Vienna, 2014 * 10th Gwangju Biennale: Burning Down the House, Gwangju, Korea, 2014 * Rockaway!, MoMA PS1, Fort Tilden and Rockaway Beach, 2014 * AIRBNB Pavilion, 2014 Venice Architecture Biennale, 2014 * Abandon the parents, Statens Museum for Kunst, 2014 References 1985 births Living people American male artists California College of the Arts alumni ","title":"Stewart Uoo"},{"id":"55949176","text":"Hogback Mountain is the highest peak in the northern portion of Shenandoah National Park as well as the highest point in Warren County in northern Virginia, United States.

It performed well but lacked a constructor after Samolot became insolvent in 1930, so only one was completed. Design and development The increasing number of Polish aeroclubs in the early 1930s called for a suitable training aircraft. LOPP, the group that encouraged Polish air-mindedness put out a call for suitable designs, powered by a engine, that would be cheap to buy and to run. Three designs received development contracts, the PZL 5, the Sido S.1 and the M.N.5. The latter was designed by Józef Medwecki and Zygmund Nowakowski, both of whom worked for Samolot. With the company's help, two M.N.5 airframes were built, one for static load testing and the other for flight. The wood-framed M.N.5 was a single bay biplane with stagger and a large interplane gap to ease cockpit access. The equal span upper and lower wings were both in two parts with rectangular plans out to blunted tips. They were built around pairs of spars and largely covered with fabric, together with some plywood. Upper and lower wings were braced together with conventional N-form interplane struts but in addition a long steel tube strut, larger in diameter than the others, ran in the plane of the forward spars from the top of the interplane strut down to the lower spar just outboard of the root. As well as replacing flying wires, this strut supported the leading edge of the lower wing when the wings were disconnected from the root and folded back alongside the fuselage, hinging on the rear spars. The wing root was strengthened by an inverted V-strut from its spars to the upper fuselage longeron. The upper centre section was formed by an aerofoil section fuel tank, held over the upper fuselage by three pairs of struts, the forward-most leaning rearwards to the forward spar and the others, in parallel, outwards to the rear spars. Only the lower wing was mounted with dihedral; it also carried the M.N.5's full span, narrow chord ailerons. With wings folded, the M.N.5 was wide. The M.N.5 was powered by a Armstrong Siddeley Genet five-cylinder radial engine enclosed by a Townend ring. The mostly wooden fuselage had four longerons connected by frames, though the forward part was reinforced with steel tubes. Its covering, including rounded decking, was plywood. There were two cockpits in tandem, fitted with dual control. The instructor sat in front under the wing and the student just aft of the trailing edge. Behind the pupil's cockpit there was a third seat under a detachable ply cover. Its curved and slightly pointed empennage was steel- framed and fabric-covered with a rudder that extended down to the keel. The tailplane's angle of incidence could be adjusted in flight. There were separate elevators, each identical to each other and to the rudder, keeping costs down. The M.N.5 had a wide track, divided undercarriage with mainwheels on cranked half-axles hinged from the fuselage underside centreline; a Vickers oleo strut from the stub wing and a radius arm formed a V-strut on each side. Its short tailskid had a vertical, rubber cord shock absorber. It flew for the first time on 21 August 1932 from Poznań-Ławica. Early testing revealed some stability problems which were overcome by moving the engine forward in a longer nose. The M.N.5 was then flown by both civil and service pilots, who remarked on its good handling and manoeuvrability. The Department of Aeronautics, looking for a replacement for its Hanriots, was enthusiastic and the construction of a second prototype to speed development was proposed. Unfortunately, as Samolot was in the process of liquidation, another builder had to be found. The Ministry proposed PZL who were developing the PZL 5 and showed no interest in helping a competitor, so no more N.M.5s were built. Operational history The lone example was bought by the Vilnius aeroclub in 1931 and, registered as SP-AEH, served them for many years. It took part in many rallies and competed in regional and national championships.

Pickhardt Jr. (1908-2004) was an American Social Realist painter and printmaker. He was born in Westwood, Massachusetts, in 1908 and grew up in West Newton, Massachusetts. He attended the Boston Latin School and Harvard University, graduating in 1931. He studied art under Harold K. Zimmerman, who also tutored Jack Levine and Hyman Bloom. In his paintings and prints of the 1930s and 40s, Pickhardt often depicted working-class city dwellers such as newsboys, butchers, and washerwomen. In 1942 he was awarded the Shope Prize by the Society of American Etchers at the National Academy of Design. He exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art, the 1952 International Exhibition in Japan, the 1966 American Drawing Biennial in Norfolk, Virginia, the Berkshire Museum, and other venues in Boston and New York. Pickhardt moved to New York City in 1940 but eventually moved back to Boston where he met his wife, Rosamond Forbes, daughter of Fogg Museum director Edward W. Forbes. He taught at the Worcester Museum School, Fitchburg Art Museum, and Sturbridge Art School. Carl Pickhardt’s first “Free Form” paintings pioneered the use of the shaped canvas and called for a new pictorial structure without horizontal or vertical reference. Referring to his paintings as “sculptural,” or “abstractions in new shapes,” Pickhardt fractured the space of traditional painting and paralleled the research of modern mathematicians. Pickhardt first introduced his Free Form paintings in 1953, seven years before Frank Stella’s first experimentation with “deductive” pictorial structure, and nine years before Kenneth Noland’s lozenge shaped chevron paintings. Like Hans Arp before him, Pickhardt derived pictorial structure from the physical character of the picture support itself. Each painting may be revolved a turntable, appearing in any position around the axes fixing their centers to the wall. As suggested by art historian Parker Tyler, “each outline quivers, expands and contracts, the way the heard does in a human body, sending out waves of energy.”¹ Unconstrained by the traditional boundaries of a rectangular frame, Pickhardt’s spontaneous paintings “combine the cerebral and the intuitive, with a critical independence and a controlled passion and intensity in his forms and shapes.”² His works are included in the permanent collections of the New York Public Library, the Addison Gallery of American Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Harvard University's Fogg Museum, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Brooklyn Museum, the Library of Congress, and the Museum of Modern Art. His papers are on file with the Archives of American Art.

History  Plans for the casino were revealed in 1997 by Windsor Woodmont, a company formed by several Dallas-based real estate developers. Hyatt Hotels was tapped to manage the casino. Excavation work on the site began in August 1998, but stalled later that year, reportedly because of financing problems related to the arrival of two other large casinos in Black Hawk (the Lodge and the Isle of Capri). Construction resumed in 2000. The casino opened on December 20, 2001 as the Black Hawk Casino by Hyatt. At opening, it was the largest casino in Colorado, with of gaming space, containing 1,332 slot machines, 16 blackjack tables and 6 poker tables. The casino was designed as the first phase of a destination resort, with later additions planned to include a 350-suite hotel tower, a convention center, nightclubs, a spa, and a mountaintop recreation park connected to the casino by a gondola lift. Revenue in the casino's first year fell short of expectations. As a result, Windsor Woodmont defaulted on payments towards $100 million of bonds that had been issued to finance the construction. Bondholders soon moved to foreclose on the casino, forcing the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2002. The next year, Hyatt's management agreement was terminated, the casino's name was changed to the Mountain High Casino, and Windsor Woodmont took over operations. Ameristar Casinos bought the property out of bankruptcy in 2004 for $117 million in cash plus $2.5 million in stock. It was rebranded under the Ameristar name in 2006, following an $80-million renovation. A hotel tower with 536 rooms was added in 2009 at a cost of $235 million. Pinnacle Entertainment acquired Ameristar Casinos in 2013. In 2016, Gaming and Leisure Properties bought most of Pinnacle's real estate assets, including Ameristar Black Hawk, in a leaseback transaction. In 2018, Penn National Gaming acquired the property's operations as part of its acquisition of Pinnacle.

Owen J. Roberts High School drafts students from Owen J. Roberts Middle School, which sits across the parking lot from the high school.  History  The school district is named for Owen Josephus Roberts, a supreme court justice born in 1875. He was known for being the deciding vote and controller of the majority opinion between the liberals and the conservatives. He purchased land in the Birchrunville area that was to be used for a country home, crops, and cattle, and he spent a large portion of his time volunteering in his community. He died in 1955. The current high school unit was built in 1957, though through the years many renovations have been done to accommodate for an increasing class size, including the construction of a new wing and a neighboring middle school on the property, built in 2009. Dr. Richard Marchini was the principal until he was promoted in 2018 to be the Director of Pupil Services. Also in 2018, Dr. Susan T. Lloyd was hired to be the Superintendent of Schools, replacing Dr. Michael L. Christian. Though somewhat of a contentious choice after her tenure as a principal at North Coventry Elementary School, she is working to open a dialogue and a course of action about incidents of gun-related violence in schools.  Theatre  Two straight plays are performed annually, as well as one musical. The musical directors have changed many times in the past years. The fall play—directed by Ms. Dawn Galambos—of 2017 was William Gibson's The Miracle Worker and the fall play of 2018 was Jules Tasca's Telling Wilde Tales: An Adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s Fairy Tales.

She is an epidemiologist known for her research on the prevalence of psychological disorders and psychiatric epidemiology, as it pertains to rates and risks of anxiety and mood disorders across generations. Among her many influential works are longitudinal studies of the impact of parental depression on their children. Weissman worked with Gerald Klerman in developing interpersonal psychotherapy as a short-term treatment for depression. They co-authored with Bruce Rounsaville and Eva Chevron the influential volume Interpersonal Psychotherapy of Depression: A Brief, Focused, Specific Strategy. Extending the approach to adolescents, Weissman co-authored the book Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents, with Laura Mufson, Kristen Pollack Dorta, and Donna Moreau. Other books co-authored by Weissman, including The Guide to Interpersonal Psychotherapy: Updated and Expanded Edition, offered further developments of their psychotherapeutic approach. Weissman and Klerman were jointly honored by the National Academy of Medicine in 1994 as recipients of the Rhoda and Bernard Sarnat International Prize in Mental Health. In 1996, they jointly received the Joseph Zubin Award established by the American Psychopathological Association for seminal contributions to psychopathology research. Weissman has received numerous awards for her accomplishments including the Rema Lapouse Award for significant contributions to pediatric epidemiology in 1985, the Joseph Zubin Award for lifetime achievement from the Society for Research in Psychopathology in 1995, the Distinguished Service Award from the American Psychiatric Association in 2001, the Gold Medal Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry in 2007, and the Thomas William Salmon Medal from the New York Academy of Medicine in 2009.  Biography  Weissman completed her bachelor's degree with honors at Brandeis University in 1956. She obtained a Masters in Social Work from the University of Pennsylvania in 1958, and subsequently worked as a psychiatric social worker in Chicago, IL, Glasgow, Scotland, and at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. Weissman completed her PhD in Chronic Disease Epidemiology at the Yale University School of Medicine in 1974, and subsequently joined the faculty of the Departments of Psychiatry and Epidemiology at Yale University of School of Medicine, where she remained until 1987. In 1987, Weissman became Chief of the Division of Clinical and Genetic Epidemiology at the New York State Psychiatry Institute and Professor of Epidemiology in Psychiatry at Columbia University. Weissman had four children by her marriage to Sherman Weissman, including Jonathan Weissman and seven grandchildren including Rachel Weissman. She was married to her research collaborator Gerald Klerman for seven years until his death in 1992. She later married Nobel Prize laureate Marshall Nirenberg. After Nirenberg's death in 2010, Weissman assisted in submitting his papers to the National Library of Medicine.  Research  Weissman is widely regarded as an expert on clinical depression. Her early work, in collaboration with Gerald Klerman, focused on the efficacy of interpersonal therapy as treatment for major depression and other disorders. She developed keen interest in maternal depression and its impact on the development of child psychopathology. In collaborative work, Weissman studied mother-child pairs to determine the impact of maternal depression on children's mental health, and reported increased rates of psychiatric disorders among children of mothers who remained depressed following treatment. Weissman and her colleagues examined gender differences in rates of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and other conditions, and examined genetic and psychosocial factors related to depression. Weissman led a cross- national study of the epidemiology of major depression and bipolar disorder, which documented many similarities in the diagnosis of depression and bipolar disorder across countries, including the United States, Canada, France, West Germany, Italy, Lebanon, Taiwan, Korea, and New Zealand.

The first ice patch was discovered on the mountain Thandlät, west of the Kusawa Lake campground which is west of Whitehorse, Yukon. The Yukon Ice Patch Project began shortly afterwards with a partnership between archaeologists in partnership with six Yukon First Nations, on whose traditional territory the ice patches were found. They include the Carcross/Tagish First Nation, the Kwanlin Dün First Nation, the Ta’an Kwäch’än Council, the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, the Kluane First Nation, and the Teslin Tlingit Council. Ice patches Cryologists describe how ice patches, such the rare Yukon alpine region ice patches, differ from glaciers. The latter are constantly moving; they gradually build up mass over time until they reach a certain size, when they slowly flow downhill. Unlike glaciers, ice patches do not move. As some of the snow remaining from winter accumulation melts, the rest is gradually compressed into ice. Ice patches do not achieve enough mass to flow downhill so any artifacts within are preserved intact without being crushed. History In the 1990s \\"during a period of extremely warm summer temperatures\\" with ice patches melting, the Yukon Ice Patch Project began. With contributions from Sheila Greer (Champagne and Aishihik First Nations), Heather Jones (Carcross/Tagish First Nation), Rae Mombourquette (Kwanlin Dün First Nation), John Fingland (Kluane First Nation), Mark Nelson and Jason Shorty (Ta’an Kwäch’än Council) and Tip Evans (Teslin Tlingit Council).

The message was on Whiggish principles, asking that the Tory-dominated House would turn their loyal addresses into bills of supply, to enable the King (William III) to build a standing army and forge alliances to counteract the French threat to the peace of Europe. An angry Commons declared the petition ‘scandalous, insolent and seditious; tending to destroy the constitution of Parliaments, and to subvert the established government of the realm’. The five presenters of the petition were ordered into the custody of the serjeant-at-arms, then four of them were sent as prisoners to Gatehouse Prison, where they remained till the end of the session.

She was employed by the Women's Social and Political Union and was one of the first suffragettes to be force-fed. She left the WSPU in 1912 in protest at the ejection of the Pethick-Lawrences, but continued to work for women's suffrage. Life Ainsworth was born in Blything in Suffolk in 1885, and she was brought up in Salisbury. She became a teacher but decided in 1909 to become a full time worker for the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1909. Ainsworth was drafted to co-ordinate WSPU activities in the Midlands with Gladice Keevil. She was involved in the protest on 17 September 1909 when Charlotte Marsh, Mary Leigh and Patricia Woodlock climbed onto the roof of Bingley Hall in Birmingham. They were protesting at women being excluded from a political meeting where the British Prime Minister Asquith was giving a speech. Marsh , Leigh and Woodlock threw roof tiles which they levered up with an axe at the Asquith's car and at the police.Myall, M. (2004-09-23).

Retrieved December 2017 They went to trial and were sent onto Winson Green Prison, along with Hilda Burkitt and as they arrived were singing protest songs loudly and refusing to wear prison dress claiming 'political' not criminal status. Ainsworth was with Hugh Franklin on the train that Churchill was travelling on when he challenged him on his attitude to suffragettes and caused a scene in which Franklin was arrested and went on hunger strike in prison himself . She worked at the Woman's Press shop in 1910 and was an organiser in Kent, later she left Newcastle WSPU due to split in the movement and worked for Votes for Women with National Political League. The league was started by Mary Adelaide Broadhurst and Margaret Milne Farquharson and in 1913 Ainsworth would be the NPL secretary. First force-feeding In protest about not being treated as a political prisoner she, Marsh and Leigh went on hunger strike. They became some of the first suffragette hunger strikers to be forcibly fed. Ainsworth obviously objected to being forcibly fed. After she was released she wrote an open letter to the first hunger striker, Marion Wallace Dunlop, describing her experience. Ainsworth described in how it felt when she was force fed as \\"horrible choking and stunned sensation\\" and the removal of the tube felt 'as if my inside was being pulled out' in Votes for Women 8 October 1909. The WSPU took advantage of the opportunity for publicity and after a doctor's report of physical and \\"nervous' damage, prepared an unsuccessful case for assault against the home secretary and prison authorities on their behalf. Dr Ernest Helby (who did the force feeding) wrote to the Home Office after being threatened in the street by Ainsworth and Patricia Woodlock, and later had windows broken but police kept it quiet.

The WSPU as part of their campaign of civil disobedience had decided that if women \\"didn't count, then they were not going to be counted\\". Ainsworth hired a room used by a dance academy in Jazreel's Hall (the religious folly known as Jezreel's Tower in Gillingham). Ainsworth was boarding locally with a WSPU supporter. Over 40 women gathered there to avoid being at home during the census. However they enjoyed themselves so much that the police were called and they tipped off the census enumerators and they were counted. The census return says \\"Party of Suffragettes assembled in Dancing Academy – 40 in number 1 male and 39 females\\", but carries no details of who was there. Honour Ainsworth and Marsh were invited as leading suffragettes to Eagle House in Batheaston in April. This was the home of Mary Blathwayt and her parents. They invited leading suffragettes to plant trees to commemorate their achievements. A plaque was made to record each event and Colonel Linley Blathwayt would take photographs. A Cypressus Lawsoniana Wisselii was planted to record Ainsworth's achievement and Colonel Blathwayt also took a portrait photograph.

Family and early life Elizabeth Freke was born in 1641 in Hannington, Wiltshire into the wealthy household of Ralph Freke and Cicely Culpeper. Her mother died when she was just seven years old, leaving her the eldest woman in the house of her four sisters (including Frances, later Lady Norton). Her father was a lawyer in London, England who had an estate in both Kent and Wiltshire in later years. The estate also belonged to Elizabeth's maternal aunt. In 1672, she married her second cousin, Percy Freke of Rathbury Castle county Cork, Ireland, in secret at the age of 30. At the time, this was considered to be a relatively late age for a woman to marry and start a family. They were believed to have married for love in Covent Garden. On 2 June 1675 she gave birth to their only son Ralph Freke. The marriage between Elizabeth and Percy was not very happy and was often the topic of many diary entries. In fact, they did not live in the same household for much of their marriage. Her relationship with her son was estranged due to their living apart for months at a time. Elizabeth spent her time in a Norfolk estate given to her by her father. At one point later in the marriage, Percy returned to Ireland and left Elizabeth with her son and only 15 Euros. She then left to visit her sister until 1685, and her son shortly after fell ill of smallpox, but recovered. In 1704, Percy came to live with Elizabeth in Norfolk, but due to illness, he died in her arms two years later. Personal life and death Elizabeth Freke had a somewhat rocky relationship with her husband as he financially drained her of her resources, although she had increasingly used what she had and began to be involved with the church of St. Cecilia as she spent personal time and money for its repair. As she grew more involved, she began to assert her dominance on the church as she felt she had gained the control from her financial contributions. On 14 February 1713 the Bishop of Norwich instructed the vicar of Gayton to bar her from the church entirely. In reference to her death, Elizabeth Freke had initially wanted to be buried next to her husband in the vault she had supported. As a result of her banishment from the church, she was not permitted to do such a thing due to the altercation. She evidently is currently buried in Westminster Abbey when she died in 1714 at age 69.  Elizabeth Freke's Book of Common Prayer  This common prayer book was given to West Bilney church in 1710 and is the oldest book remaining of St. Cecilia. After the death of her husband, she presented the church West Bilney with this bible and communion plate. Elizabeth Freke noted this gift as being to \\"my church of West Bilney\\" as if it were her own. She often viewed her patron efforts as a sense of ownage with which she controlled. The book was leather-bound with a piece on the front engraved with a classical temple with statues of saints. The Latin words \\"Domus Orationis,\\" or \\"House of Prayer\\" are also written. There are decorated pictorial squares throughout the book which highlight its expense and quality. The book was relatively small as it lacks metrical psalms. The book has been since repaired in 1964. There was an ongoing dispute in regard to her efforts within the church and her lack of paying the tithe. She believed that she had donated enough by paying the curate and upkeep of the church. A few years later, she was officially banished from the church and died the following year.  The Freke Papers  The Freke Papers refers to the two manuscript books that Elizabeth created. In these books, she completes many diary entries that give us an insight to how she lived her life. Also within these manuscript books, she wrote notes from published medical books to which she had access, and other recipe books she found. She collected medical remedies from these recipe books and published medical writings from her findings. With her knowledge of these precedented examples, she prepared some of her own remedies as she consulted with other physicians and medical practitioners of the time. She even kept a personal inventory list of the ingredients for her medical recipes, along with the remedies themselves. It is known that she had stockpiles of many common 'cure-all' recipes of the time like Aqua Mirabolus, Ague Water, Poppy Water, and Cowslip Wine. These recipe books were passed down from family members, where Elizabeth continued to add her writings. The original manuscript books are currently held at the British Library under archives and manuscripts; however, there is a published version edited by Mary Carbery called Mrs. Elizabeth Freke, Her Diary 1671 to 1714. Carbery transcribed from Elizabeth's original manuscripts and rewrote her entries in chronological order, leaving out some of Elizabeth's collected recipes and all of her inventory lists.

Wilkinson was a wealthy London merchant. He married Mary Thurloe (or Thurlow) at Lincoln's Inn chapel on 16 December 1735. She was an heiress and he received about £10,000 out of her fortune. In 1752, he purchased the estate Polestead or Westgate, Norfolk and built Burnham Westgate Hall in the 1750s using Matthew Brettingham, the Holkham estate architect. Country Life Burnham Westgate Hall He and Mary had two daughters and a son and he retired from business when this son died in 1760. In the 1760s he held about £50,000 of Government stock, and about £6,000 of Bank stock and when his wife died in 1771 he held her property in trust. His daughter Anne married Thomas Pitt on 29 July 1771. It was said he gave her £30,000 down, and at least as much more in expectation, and Pitt referred to \\"the great inheritance’ his wife brought\\". Wilkinson's second daughter Mary married John Smith without her parents’ consent. At the 1774 general election Wilkinson was returned by his son-in-law Pitt, who stood himself, as Member of Parliament for Old Sarum. They were returned again in 1780. Wilkinson voted with the Opposition, and apparently never spoke in Parliament. He suffered a stroke in May 1782 and was incapacitated for his last two years in parliament. Wilkinson died on 26 February 1784 aged 90. His will became a case in Chancery mainly because the Smith's had been left out of it. There were also considerable complications as to which property was his and which that of his wife. The Smith's son Sidney became a distinguished admiral.

The work was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Alan Gilbert. It was premiered by the New York Philharmonic under the conductor Edo de Waart on November 30, 2017, at David Geffen Hall, New York City. Composition =Background= Evening Land has a duration of roughly 13 minutes and is cast in a single movement. The work's commission was originally intended for Per Nørgård, a fellow Danish composer and Sørensen's former teacher, who had been awarded the 2014 Marie-Josée Kravis Prize for New Music by the New York Philharmonic. Nørgård was unable to complete the commission due to scheduling conflicts, however, and he instead recommended Sørensen for the job. The piece was inspired by an image Sørensen recalled from his childhood on the island of Zealand in Denmark. In the score program note, the composer wrote, \\"I am looking out of the window, and there is a very special evening light over the fields – far away there are trees and a cow. It is as if the world is infinite.\\" He continued: An oboe solo written near the end of Evening Land was intended as a tribute to Sørensen's father-in-law Frederik Gislinge, an oboist for the Esbjerg Ensemble in Denmark, who fell ill during the composition process. \\"I guess I hoped the solo would help him heal,\\" Sørensen wrote. \\"Unfortunately that did not happen and to our great sorrow he died before he could hear the solo and the whole work – Evening Land. Thus Evening Land encountered another evening – the evening of life – a finality.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for an orchestra consisting of two flutes (both doubling piccolo), two oboes (2nd doubling English horn), two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, percussion, timpani, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, James R. Oestreich of The New York Times called it \\"stirring work, which runs some 13 minutes, tracing a symmetrical arc, from quiet, through frenetic and eruptive activity, back to quiet. Melody is everywhere, but it comes in fragments and wisps, fits, starts and cacophonous bursts.\\" David Wright of the New York Classical Review similarly described it as a \\"lapidary score, in both its subtle daubs of orchestral color and its sudden bursts of activity.\\" He added, \\"Evening Land proved well worth additional hearings.\\" References Compositions by Bent Sørensen 2017 compositions Compositions for symphony orchestra Music commissioned by the New York Philharmonic ","title":"Evening Land (composition)"},{"id":"55950722","text":"Vulcănița may refer to the following rivers in Romania: * Vulcănița, a tributary of the Holbav in Brașov County * Vulcănița (Homorod), a right tributary of the river Homorod in Brașov County * Vulcănița, a tributary of the Vulcana in Dâmbovița County ","title":"Vulcănița"},{"id":"55950725","text":"Volevčice may refer to: * Volevčice (Jihlava District), a village in the Czech Republic * Volevčice (Most District), a village in the Czech Republic ","title":"Volevčice"},{"id":"55950727","text":"Voděrady may refer to: * Voděrady (Ústí nad Orlicí District), a village in the Czech Republic * Voděrady (Blansko District), a village in the Czech Republic * Voděrady (Rychnov nad Kněžnou District), a village in the Czech Republic ","title":"Voděrady"},{"id":"55950731","text":"Urqu Jawira may refer to: * Urqu Jawira (Aroma), a Bolivian river * Urqu Jawira (Pedro Domingo Murillo), a Bolivian river ","title":"Urqu Jawira"},{"id":"55950797","text":"Warawara Lake may refer to: * Warawara Lake (Cochabamba), Bolivia * Warawara Lake (Oruro), Bolivia * Warawara Lake (Potosí), Bolivia ","title":"Warawara Lake"},{"id":"55950823","text":"David Vlahov (born August 31, 1952) is an American epidemiologist and professor emeritus at the UCSF School of Nursing, of which he previously served as dean from April 2011 to August 2016.

During her tenure as first lady, she was responsible for furnishing and establishing the new , performing charitable works, and accompanying her husband on various diplomatic trips. Early life María Natalia Elena Gallegos Rosales was born on 15 June 1882 in San Salvador, El Salvador to Elena Rosales Ventura and Salvador Gallegos Valdés Her father was at one time the president of the Supreme Court of El Salvador and held the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Education on several occasions. Gallegos completed her basic education in San Salvador and was then sent abroad to finish her education in Paris. In 1907 when Julio Acosta García was sent to El Salvador as the Consul-General, he was introduced the Gallegos. After a three-year courtship, the two were married in April 1910. On 20 February 1911, Gallegos gave birth to twins, María, who died at birth, and Elena Zulai de Jesus Acosta Gallegos in the Santa Lucia neighborhood of San Salvador. Career In 1915, Acosta was recalled to return to Costa Rica and assume the position as Secretary of State for the Office of Foreign Relations, Justice, Grace, and Worship. Acosta was often out of the country on business, and during his term became the first Central American Minister to make official visits for all the countries of the isthmus. Gallegos was expecting another child in 1917, and gave birth to an unnamed daughter on 23 February 1917, who died at birth, barely a month after the coup d'état led by Federico Tinoco Granados on 27 January 1917. As soon as they could travel, the couple left the country and returned to El Salvador to live with Gallegos' parents. Julio initially worked as the manager of their farm, La Esperanza, but soon found work in the editorial office of the Diario del Salvador newspaper. After Tinoco was forced to resign in 1919 and the temporary president Juan Bautista Quirós Segura ceded power to interim president Francisco Aguilar Barquero, Acosta was invited to return to Costa Rica. Bringing his family back to Costa Rica, Acosta began campaigning for the presidency. He was elected with 89% of the vote and took office on 8 May 1920. The immediate problem for Gallegos, with Acosta's election was where they were to live. The , which had served as the was rejected as a residence or place to conduct business because of its association with Tinoco's dictatorship. In December 1920, the Legislative Assembly approved the purchase of a property located at the corner of 3rd Avenue and 15th Street, which had been built at the end of the 1870s by Tomás Guardia. At the time of the purchase, the building was serving as the headquarters of the Northern Railway Company. (Since 1995 the former presidential home has been the home of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal of Costa Rica). Gallegos was responsible for decorating, furnishing and organizing the Presidential House and due to the limited budget of the country, used her own funds to prepare the home in a simple but stately manner. During Acosta's presidency, Gallegos was also instrumental in bringing the religious order of the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd to Costa Rica. This group had been established in León, Nicaragua in 1911 but expansion during the anticlerical Tinoco regime, had been impossible. Concerned with the lack of opportunities for women, Gallegos and other women, who worked with the women incarcerated at the women's prison, invited the sisters to Costa Rica, with the approval of the government. The Sisters established the House of Refuge ( which was aimed at teaching reading, writing, geography and arithmetic to women prisoners. Those who were released, could remain at the refuge and were provided with room and board, in exchanged for their labor in washing, ironing and repairing clothes for public patrons. The term of presidency ended in 1924 and the family moved to Paris, where Acosta worked for the Red Cross for three years before returning to Costa Rica. From his return until 1944, when he was reappointed as Foreign Minister, Acosta held various positions with the government. Gallegos accompanied him on various diplomatic missions, including the 1945 conference in San Francisco, California for the signing of the United Nations Charter. Death and legacy Gallegos died on 30 August 1954 in San José, Costa Rica. Her only surviving child, Zulay married the Colombian diplomat, Pedro Manuel Revollo Samper.

It was built for Joseph Sappington, a relative of John Sappington who was a prominent figure in early St. Louis. It is located near Crestwood, Missouri and was added to the NRHP in 1982. History The Sappington family was a large family in early St. Louis. The patriarch, John Sappington, had seventeen children, although Joseph Sappington was not one of them. Joseph Sappington was likely the cousin or nephew of John Sappington, and he was one of the witnesses to John Sappington's will in 1815. The Joseph Sappington House is one of five pioneer houses in the Crestwood area, and was the last to be nominated on the NRHP. These houses were built in 1820 or earlier. The house was built around a minor tributary of Gravois Creek, and is located about one mile southeast of Crestwood, Missouri.  Architecture  The house is a two-story building that faces east and is originally made from logs. However, the house has been clapboarded on the exterior. Furthermore, the house had been whitewashed multiple times throughout its history, and plaster was placed over visible logs. It is likely that the house was built in multiple phases. The interior was renovated started in 1953, and it was restored to reflect its original state. The house has three log rooms that each have their own chimney.

Background Walter Heilprin Pollak was born on June 4, 1887, in Summit, New Jersey to Gustav Pollak (born circa 1849 in Vienna, Austria; died 1919) and Celia Heilprin in a family of \\"bookish, nonreligious Jews\\" who had come to the States in the 1850s. His father was an editor and writer for The Nation magazine. Walter Pollak attended DeWitt Clinton High School and then Columbia University in New York City. In 1907, he graduated from Harvard University and in 1910 from Harvard Law School. Career Pollak become lifelong friends with Benjamin N. Cardozo after working at Simpson, Warren and Cardozo in the 1910s Pollak first joined the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell but within two years had moved to Simpson, Warren and Cardozo, where he started a lifelong friendship with Benjamin N. Cardozo (who in 1913 left the firm to become a New York Supreme Court Justice). Pollak stayed on, and the firm eventually became Engelhard, Pollak, Pitcher, Stern and Clarke. During the 1920s, according to Max Lowenthal, Pollak was part of a \\"loose partnership\\" of radical attorneys that included Joseph R. Brodsky, Swinburne Hale, Walter Nelles, Isaac Shorr, Carol Weiss King, and King's brother-in-law Carl Stern. Pollak defended Communist leader Benjamin Gitlow in 1925 In 1925, on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he argued his first case before the United States Supreme Court in Gitlow v. New York, defending Communist Party member Benjamin Gitlow against his conviction for \\"advocacy of criminal anarchy.\\" The court upheld Gitlow's conviction but importantly recognized that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment incorporated and thus protected fundamental provisions of the Bill of Rights, including the freedom of speech. (New York State Governor Al Smith commuted Gitlow's sentence.) In the early 1930s, on behalf of International Labor Defense, Pollak joined the defense team of the Scottsboro Boys with Joseph R. Brodsky. He took an active part in framing the appeals in Powell v. Alabama (1932), as well as Norris v. Alabama and Patterson v. Alabama (both 1935), the latter which he argued with the support of the ACLU. In 1937, early in the Great Depression, the firm dissolved. Pollak became of counsel to Cohen, Cole, Weiss, and Wharton (which became Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison). Personal and death Louis H. Pollak, Pollak's son, was a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Pollak was the father of United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Louis Heilprin Pollak, who had served as dean of both Yale Law School and the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He was a close friend of law professor Zechariah Chafee Jr.. Pollak died age 53 on October 2, 1940, of a heart attack. See also * Louis H. Pollak * Benjamin N. Cardozo * Joseph R.

Vanity Fair, October 1, 1931. Photograph might date from 1929.Mahrenholz photographed her for UHU magazine, May 1929. She was born Elisabeth Meyer, in Berlin on 10 February 1903 and died at Herkenrath near Cologne on 21 July 1971.Adels, page 392 Von Reppert became a bit of an 'it' girl celebrity, as shown by the coverage given her by Weimar Republic era magazines such as Die Dame, Das Leben and UHU in the late 1920s. Subsequently and concurrently she went to New York and England. It isn't clear what happened during the years of war and the peace afterwards though she and her husband both died at or near his family's West German seat. New York The Balzac Galleries, on 449 Park Avenue, 102 East 57 Street, held an exhibition of her paintings from February 10 to 28 February 1931. One report on 22 Feb 1931 read: At the Balzac galleries a lady who calls herself Jack von Reppert- Bismarck, holds forth with a large show of paintings and drawings... In the current exhibition at the Balzac Galleries the face of a fat clown. the red ears of the blue frocked barker of the Cirque d'hiver, the rush of white horses, the stab of an out-thrust hand are set down with swift singing color and an unswerving line. TIME: Monday, February 23, 1931 continued: Last week at New York's Balzac Galleries, Frau Jack von Reppert-Bismarck was heralded as a great-granddaughter-in-law of the Iron Chancellor's cousin, and also as Germany's Marie Laurencin. The comparison with Laurencin is superficially apt. Both artists, charming personally, paint delicate, decadent little girls. With extreme freedom of line, the work of both is eminently suitable for arty magazines. Both have the trick of inserting self portraits in most of their pictures. But Marie Laurencin is 45, red haired, very much a woman of the world, served a long painstaking art apprenticeship before her paintings caught the public fancy. Jack von Reppert-Bismarck is bashful, blonde and 22 [28], looks about 15, and is something of a child prodigy. In May 1932 Balzac Galleries exhibited the Chinese-American avant-garde painter Yun Gee. Reppert-Bismarck and Beaton During the Friday to Monday (weekend) of May 29, 1932, Cecil Beaton, whom Jack had met in New York, on the wet Sunday set his house party the task of decorating his bedroom. Beaton wrote that the 'room was to be painted in garish colours with niches filled with circus performers, with baroque emblems, barley-sugar poles and flowered mirrors'.Ashcombe: The Story of a Fifteen-Year Lease, by Cecil Beaton, BATSFORD, London, 1949, page 47. Rex Whistler, Jack and her husband Jörg (Yorck) von Reppert-Bismarck, Oliver Messel, Lord Berners, Christopher Sykes and Beaton himself set to. Jack's piece, the equestrienne, is almost the only element to survive.Cecil Beaton at Home, An Interior Life, Andrew Ginger, Rizzoli, 2016, page 62-. Siegfried Sassoon and Edith Olivier were also of the party but did not join in the painting. Beaton's description of the transformation of his bedroom into a circus-room ends thus: 'Mme von Bismarck pictured an equestrienne on a flower-dappled circus pony, and her husband decided to portray 'the strong man of the Fair' with volute mustachios, tattoo marks, heavy ball-weights and chains. However, Yorck Bismarck eschewed the traditional circus manner of carefully finished realistic painting for the more modern slapdash strokes of the brush, and the next weekend, Rex Whistler could not resist touching up the flowing chevelure and mustachios, the better to conform with the other murals. 'Please don't, Rex' I pleaded. 'There'll be hell to pay if Yorck ever discovered you've touched the thing'. But the temptation was too great. Rex was unable to resist repainting, meticulously and realistically, the crisply waving hair, the mustachios, then of course, the column-like throat, the brawny chest, and so on down the whole over- muscular body. Unfortunately, it so happened that the Bismarcks drove over from Biddesden [ home to Bryan Guinness ] the following Sunday to admire their handiwork. Although my strong man had been made into a work of art, the Bismarck's were enraged at the indignity committed upon the 'strong man', and a nasty situation was created in the artistic world of which reverberations were heard for many weeks to come.'Ashcombe: The Story of a Fifteen-Year Lease, by Cecil Beaton, BATSFORD, London, 1949, pages 47-48.

They were led by head coach Kevin Donley, who served his 19th year as the head football coach at Saint Francis. The Cougars played their home games at Bishop John D'Arcy Stadium and were members of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA) Mideast League (MEL). The Cougars finished 2nd in the MSFA MEL division and received an at-large bid to the NAIA playoffs. The team went on to win the first football national championship in the school's history. In the 2016 NAIA Football National Championship, the Cougars defeated the Baker Wildcats, 38-17. Kevin Donley was voted by the American Football Coaches Association as the 2016 NAIA National Coach of the Year. Donley was also granted a five-year contract extension after the 2016 season. Schedule (13-1 overall, 5-1 conference) Game summaries 10/1/2016 - The #2-ranked Cougars played another historic game vs. the #1-ranked Marian Knights, undefeated conference rivals and defending NAIA national champions. Saint Francis matched up well, and they took a 21-14 lead into the half. However, USF’s second-half mistakes allowed the Knights to take control of the game, and the Knights prevailed 35-21. This year's game began a new tradition between the two Indiana perennial powers. The regular season contest will now be referred to as the Franciscan Bowl. A traveling trophy will reside with the winner until the next contest. With this year's win, Marian takes a 1-0 lead in the series. 10/8/2016 - The Cougars only fell 3 places to 5th after last week's loss to Marian. This week, Saint Francis traveled to Siena Heights to face another tough conference opponent. The Cougars led 21-10 at the half. However, a strong effort by the Saints defense in the second half made the game close. In the end, Saint Francis returned home with a victory by a score of 24-22. 10/22/2016 - The Cougars returned home after a 2-game road trip to face the 24th-ranked Eagles from Robert Morris University. The match between two Top-25 teams certainly lived up to expectations. Robert Morris took the opening kick-off and scored to take an early 7-0 lead. That score held until just before halftime when the Cougars scored to tie the game. The Cougars took the second half kick-off and scored to take the lead, 14-7, a lead that never would be surrendered. Late in the game, the Cougar defense put up a defining goal line stand. Facing 1st and goal from inside the 1-yard line, The Cougars beat back the Eagles' offense on four consecutive plays to preserve the victory. For their strong performances, each team retained their position in the weekly polls. Saint Francis broke a tie to take 4th place outright, and Robert Morris retained the 24th position in the poll. 11/19/2016 - The game started out as a shoot-out as each team scored on their first 3 possessions, resulting in a 21-20 Saint Francis lead. From that point, it was all USF. The Cougars scored on each of their 7 first half possessions, taking a 44-20 lead into the half. Their scoring continued into the second half with 35 unanswered points to arrive at the final score of 79-20. The game was played under adverse weather conditions. A clear field was quickly covered with snow at the start of the game, and neither defense was able to react to the potent offenses. Cougar quarterback Nick Ferrer threw for over 350 yards as the Cougars amassed over 600 yards of total offense. Ferrer completed 5 touchdown passes, 3 of them going to Seth Coate, who had over 150 yards of receptions for the game. For their efforts, Ferrer and Coate were named the game's offensive co-MVPs. The defensive MVP award went to Lucas Sparks. 11/26/2016 - With two teams that combined to score 145 points in the first round, this game was expected to be a high-scoring affair. This game matched the #4 Saint Francis Cougars vs the #5 Morningside Mustangs, and the two teams were expected to be evenly matched. The game started with Morningside breaking out to a 20-0 lead. Saint Francis got on the scoreboard in the 2nd quarter, and the halftime lead favored Morningside by that 20-7 score. In the second half, the Cougars finally got their offense rolling, scoring the next 14 points to set the lead at 21-20. Morningside immediately responded with a touchdown of their own. Their two-point try was good, and Morningside regained the lead, 28-21. But Saint Francis scored to tie the game again, 28-28. Then, late in the 4th quarter, Saint Francis took control of the game by scoring the next two touchdowns to generate a 14 point lead, 42-28. Once again, Morningside countered with a quick touchdown, and the gap was closed to the final score of 42-35. Saint Francis controlled the ball at the end of the game to run the Mustangs out of time-outs, and the Cougars advanced to the semifinal round. The USF offense had multiple stars in the contest. For the second straight game, QB Nick Ferrer threw for 5 TD's, 3 of them once again going to Seth Coate. But the offensive Player of the Game was awarded to Justin Green, who ran for 296 yards and 1 TD on 25 carries. The defensive award went to Eric Hemmelgarn. Of special note: The win was a milestone victory for USF head coach Kevin Donley. The win was the 300th victory in his long and illustrious career as the all time leader in wins in the NAIA division of football. After the game, Donley was presented with an encased football to commemorate the achievement. 12/03/2016 - With the upset loss by #1 Marian last week, USF missed the anticipated rematch with the Knights. Instead, the Cougars hit the road to make the 600 mile road trip to Waleska, GA to face the undefeated and #3 ranked Reinhardt Eagles. The Cougars were the last team to beat Reinhardt, in last season's FCS opening round at Saint Francis. The potent offense of the Eagles proved once again to be a tough challenge to stop. But the Cougars prevailed 42-24 due largely to big plays and turnovers. Highlights of the game include a second half 98 yard touchdown run by Justin Green on the first play after the Cougars had just completed a strong goal line stand to prevent an Eagles first down and likely score; two interceptions on back to back possessions by Saint Francis, the first being a pick-6 touchdown return and the second setting up another quick score by the Cougars; three touchdown runs by Justin Green and two touchdown catches by Seth Coate. A score in the first quarter put the Eagles in front 7-0. But Saint Francis responded quickly to tie the game, and two additional scores led to a 21-7 Saint Francis lead. This was the Eagles' largest deficit of the season and only the third time they had trailed in a ball game all season. The Eagles ended the half by kicking a field goal with zero time on the clock, an untimed down granted due to a pass interference call against USF. Each team scored once in the third quarter to take the score to 28-17. The two interceptions pushed the score to 42-17, and Reinhardt scored once again to create the final margin of victory. The Cougars will be playing in two weeks in the title game for the 4th time in their history, hoping this time to gain their first national championship. The offensive Player of the Game was once again Seth Coate, and the defensive Player of the Game was awarded to Spencer Cowherd. 12/17/2016 - For the first time in team history, the Saint Francis Cougars won their last game of the season. With their 38-17 victory over #2 Baker Wildcats, the Cougars attained their first NAIA football national championship. The win was the second for head coach Kevin Donley, having won a first title 25 years earlier while coaching the Georgetown Tigers.

Background  The exodus of Sarajevo Serbs was one of many exoduses of Serbs during Bosnian War.: \\"The exodus of Sarajevo's Serbs is just one of many Serb exoduses during this war, but it is fatal for them. The Sarajevo Serbs are the most urban, educated, and largest ...\\" Right before this exodus there was another exodus of 17,000 Serbs from Odžak.: \\"Before the exodus of the Sarajevo Serbs, the exodus of almost 17,000 Serbs from Odzak and Vukosavlje passed unnoticed in the public.\\" Both of them preceded by massive exodus of more than 250,000 Serbs from Croatia during Operation Storm which set precedents for the exodus of Sarajevo Serbs.: \\"The ethnic cleansing of the Krajina Serbs, quietly applauded by the governments of the United States and Germany, set precedents for the exodus of frightened Serbs from Sarajevo — once the beacon of Slavic and Islamic coexistence — after the Dayton accord signed December 14, 1995, in Paris. Neither the Muslim-led Bosnian Government nor the outside world, was able to offer the suburban Sarajevo Serbs — numbering approximately 150,000— convincing guarantees of safety.\\" It was reported on 1 January 1996 that 'rumours and blind panic trigger mass flight from [the] city's contested suburbs'.  Exodus  The Dayton Agreement finalized the demarcation between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS), the two post-war entities of the country. Ilijaš, Vogošća, Hadžići, Ilidža, Rajlovac and Grbavica were incorporated into FBiH, while other peripheral parts of the former Sarajevo municipality became part of RS (see Istočno Sarajevo). The Serb community massively left the FBiH part of Sarajevo for RS. Their number was first reported in 1996 as 62,000,:\\"On the other hand, Dayton's ethnic circumscription of space after the war had detrimental effects on Sarajevo, catalyzing a mass exodus in early 1996 of some sixty-two thousand Sarajevo Serbs from inside what would be the Dayton borders of Sarajevo city and its suburbs and creating today's more monoethnic postwar city (Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre 1996).\\" but it is estimated that the total number was 150,000. Australian professor Dino Murtić emphasized that exodus of Sarajevo Serbs was massive and planned and that Bosnian president Izetbegović initially demonstrated indifference about it stating that the people of Sarajevo \\"finally deserved to be free of their murderers\\".: \\"Some Serbian families even dug out and transported the remains of their ancestors from the graveyards. For them, life under the political domination of Bosniaks and/or Croats was out of question. The Izetbegovic government in Sarajevo showed indifference to this massive, planned exodus of Sarajevo's Serbs. Izetbegovic himself once said that the people of Sarajevo 'finally deserved to be free of their murderers' (Sell 1999, p. 183).\\" After some time, Izetbegović called Serbs to stay in Sarajevo.: \\"Later, he called on all Serbs to stay.\\" Some Serbs exhumated the graves of their ancestors from Sarajevo graveyards to graveyards near their new accommodation.  Responsibility  Some authors believed that all involved parties in Bosnia were responsible for the mass exodus of Sarajevo Serbs, including the officials of Republika Srpska.: \\"All sides involved in Bosnia seem set to win from such a development. Bosnian Serb authorities, international mediators, and the Bosnian federal government have all cast their shadows over the transfer of control over the Sarajevo suburbs from Republika Srpska to the Bosnian federation. All, therefore, bear some responsibility for the resulting mass exodus of Sarajevo's Serb inhabitants\\" For some authors it was difficult to determine if this exodus was voluntarily or forced.: \\"The departure of the Sarajevo Serbs after Dayton and the exodus of Serbs from Krajina further illustrate the difficulty of distinguishing between coercion and voluntarism.\\" Some authors explain that ethnic cleansing of Serbs from Croatia during Operation Storm (silently supported by major powers like United States and Germany) set precedent for the exodus of 150,000 terrified suburban Sarajevo Serbs who did not feel that a Muslim-led Bosnian government or the outside world will guarantee their safety.  Media coverage  The Western observers claimed that Serbs used mass exhumations during their exodus from Sarajevo to gain moral victory. Peter Brock argued that even after the 1996 exodus, the Western media still refused to acknowledge the flight of tens of thousands of Sarajevo Serbs that occurred at the beginning of the Bosnian War in early 1992.: \\"Years later, \\"enlightened Western\\" journalism still refused to acknowledge the flight of tens of thousands of Sarajevo's Serbs along with its entire Jewish community — both with palpable memories from World War II atrocities — on the eve of the recognition of Bosnian \\"independence\\" in early 1992. \\" Even before the exodus of Sarajevo Serbs began, another exodus of 17,000 Serbs from Odžak went unnoticed in the public. Eventually, the exodus of Sarajevo Serbs forced foreign journalists including Tom Gjelten to reconsider their initial judgement about Sarajevo being harmonious.: \\"Gjelten grudgingly conceded that \\"the Serb exodus\\" eventually forced foreign journalists \\"to reconsider their initial judgment\\" about Sarajevo's harmoniousness.\\" References  Sources    External links  * History of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina February 1996 events in Europe March 1996 events in Europe Bosnian War History of Sarajevo History of Republika Srpska 1996 in Bosnia and Herzegovina Human migration ","title":"Exodus of Sarajevo Serbs"},{"id":"55952890","text":"Hasan Tahsin Mayatepek was a Turkish diplomat.

This report became great news in Turkey and people began to believe in a common ancestor of both the Mexican Maya, and the Central Asian Turks. As a reward, Hasan Tahsin was granted the surname 'Mayatepek' (or 'Maya hill') from Atatürk himself. Afterwards Atatürk asked Mayatepek to also focus on other North American native languages like that of Inca, Aztecs and to see if a common languages was plausible between these languages and Turkish. After the fourteenth report of Mayatepek, Atatürk suspected Mayatepek of sending more of the same arguments to support this theory in order to prolong his stay in Mexico. Mayatepek was soon recalled from Mexico and no new ambassador was appointed until September 29, 1947. Influence Mayatepek laid the foundation for Mexican-Turkish relations and had a great influence in the way Mexico, and its indigenous peoples like Mayans, Aztecs, and Incas are seen in Turkey.

The canal was built as part of a construction program begun by Pope Clement XII in the early 18th century. The artificial waterway connects the Monote and Ronco rivers to the Adriatic Sea. At 11 km long, the canal is the largest artificial canal in Italy.  History  = Background = 1731 map of the canals of Ravenna. Historically, the city of Ravenna suffered episodes of destructive flooding. To combat this issue, the city of Ravenna built over the centuries a series of canals and waterways to prevent the Montone, Ronco, and Candiano Rivers from flooding. A lack of drinking water was also a chronic problem for the city, as the three aforementioned rivers are shallow, muddy, and as such provided poor drinking water. In the 7th century the Po river was diverted, leading to more sediment being swept downriver to Ravenna. Over the centuries this sediment clogged the smaller canals in the city and caused the coastline to expand outwards, disrupting the Port of Ravenna. In 1636 both the Montone and Ronco rivers flooded, destroying 140 buildings in the city. = Construction = To better facilitate the flow of water and increase access to the Port of Ravenna, a plan for a new canal was formulated in the early 18th century. The canal was constructed to tie existing canals and the three rivers of Ravenna together. When completed, the canal was planned to stretch 11 kilometers to the Adriatic. Construction was completed in 1738. The canal was named for Pope Clement XII, as at the time the Papal States controlled Ravenna. A second canal, the Panfilio Canal (known as the Canal Magne) was also constructed during this time. In the 18th century the Candiano Canal was deepened and slightly shortened as part of a infrastructure expansion project launched by Agostino Rivarola.Roberto Venturini, \\"Challenge for the primacy in Romagna\\", 17 October 2010, pg. 27. The economic importance of the Candiano Canal declined after railroads became widespread in the 19th century. However, the canal continued to service the city and the Port of Ravenna. The importance of the canal increased after the Port of Ravenna (which contained petroleum processing facilities) underwent an economic revival during the 1973 oil crisis. The canal was dredged in 2000 and in 2008, deepening it to a depth of 11.5 meters.

History  The Oghuz forebears of the Teke migrated to Transoxiana in the 7th century. Lieutenant Colonel C.E. Stuart reported that in the 1830s the Teke tribe began to settle in the lower Murghab River delta near Merv, which, he said, they destroyed around 1855. From here the Teke extended their reach to Kizil-Arvat (today's city of Serdar), ultimately splitting into the Ahal Teke, located between Kizil-Arvat and Gawars (an area Stuart called \\"Daman-i-Kuh\\"), and the Merv (today Mary) Teke, mainly between the Tejen and Murghab Rivers. Edmund O'Donovan described Merv as of 1881 as :...a heap of melancholy ruins. There are remains of baths, and palaces, and ramparts crumbling around, with nothing living but snakes and jackals to be seen, or perhaps some wandering Turkoman looking out for his sheep...This is all that remains of Merv... O'Donovan also asserted that as of 1881 : The Turkomans of Merv have only been twenty-six years in the oasis. They formerly inhabited the district around Sarakhs on the upper part of the Tejend river. They were driven from there twenty-seven years ago by the Persians, who objected to the neighbourhood of persons so disagreeable as to insist in carrying off Persian men, their wives, and daughters, and selling them at 5L per head in Bokhara. The Ahal and Mary Teke were separated by a Persian-controlled zone north of the Kopetdag Mountains called Deregez.This is a reference to the Iranian city Dargaz, which was the capital of the region described, and was called Mahometabad at that time. Though technically under Persian suzerainty, the Teke were de facto autonomous, and as O'Donovan remarked, were noted for raids to capture slaves for sale in the markets of Khiva and Bukhara. At one point the shah of Persia offered a reward of five tomans \\"for the head of each Turkoman killed raiding within his frontier.\\" O'Donovan described to the Royal Geographic Society Mary Teke inhabitants of Mäne, a village in Deregez, as \\"nominally paying tribute to Persia, but who are really independent.\\" Sir Henry Rawlinson wrote of the Ahal Teke in 1879, :\\"The original settlement of the Akhal Tekeh, on the borders of Persia, was contemporaneous with that of the Merv Tekeh, of whom they are an integral portion. The whole tribe was brought from the 'Labáb,' or banks of the Oxus... :\\"The name 'Akhal'...is borrowed from one of their chief 'obahs,' or camps, near which are the ruins of a large Persian town and mounds of fire temples...the country occupied by the 'Akhal' consists of a strip of fertile land, varying from two or three to sixteen miles in width, and extending from Kizil-Arvat, about 160 miles...to Gawars, the most easterly settlement... :\\"The number of tents of families of the Akhal are variously computed, some estimates giving as high as 20,000. A comparison of Persian and Turcoman estimates...gives an average of about 8,000 tents, or 40,000 souls, which is probably very near the truth. One-fifth of this number must be adult males. :\\"The principal settlements of the 'Akhal' are at Akhal, a permanent camp of 500 tents often increased to 1000 of various sections; Goombali, 1000 tents; Kariz, occupied only temporarily; Harrik-Kileh, Askabad, and Annau.\\" The 19th- century villages of Kizil-Arvat, Gawars, Harrik-Kileh, Askabad, and Annau cited in Sir Henry's lecture certainly correspond to the contemporary city of Serdar, village of Gäwers, Ashgabat neighborhood of Herrikgala, and cities of Ashgabat and Änew, respectively. On the map Sir Henry provided to accompany his lecture (pages 266-267), \\"Goombali\\" and \\"Kariz\\" are shown as roughly halfway between \\"Doran\\" (Durun) and \\"Yengi-Kileh\\" (Yangala), and \\"Akhal\\" as just east of Yangala, but their exact locations are uncertain. The Teke had militarily resisted Persian incursions in the 19th century intended to pacify them. The Teke came under Russian colonial rule in the 1880s. Though the Turkmen tribes defeated Russian troops during the first incursion in 1879, a subsequent invasion between 1880 and 1881, culminating in the second Battle of Gökdepe, resulted in imposition of Russian Imperial authority. Following surrender, the Teke commander, Ovezmurat Dykma-Serdar, was commissioned a major in the Russian Imperial Army. Russia's conquest of the Teke was completed in 1884 with the taking of Merv. Following this conquest, the Teke were largely pacified and reverted from slave trade to sheep raising as the main source of income. A Russian diplomat, P.M. Lessar, reported that between December 1881 and April 1882, \\"a great change had taken place\\" and \\"it became possible to travel between Askhabad and Sarakhs without escort, accompanied by only a few labourers armed with guns against chance robbers.\\"  Culture  Historically each Turkmen tribe has had its own unique carpet pattern, clothing, headgear and dialect. Teke Turkmen carpets often feature a standard Teke rosette (), called the guşly göl, which in the words of O'Bannon \\"has the least variation of all Turkoman guls [sic] and has apparently changed least through time. This is the design which is also called Royal Bokhara...It is almost always connected by intersecting blue or black lines. It is an oval- shaped octagon, usually not more than four inches high and eight inches wide. The secondary gul is a diamond-shaped form and is sometimes referred to as a 'tarantula'.\\" Typical Teke Turkmen rosette (göl) on a knotted carpet Photograph of a map of the Altyn Asyr Oriental Bazaar (Tolkuchka) in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan National flag of Turkmenistan, featuring the five rosettes of the major tribes with the Teke rosette on top The design of this rosette is reproduced in the layout of the Altyn Asyr Bazaar in Ashgabat, and is the topmost rosette on Turkmenistan's national flag.  Demographics  The Teke tribe can be subdivided in two, the Ahal Teke and Mary Teke. Lt. Col. Stuart noted as well subdivision into four clans, the Wakil (variant Wekil), Beg, Suchmuz, and Bukshi: :\\"The Wakil and Beg clans are collectively called Toctamish, as they are descended from a person of that name. The Suchmuz and Bukshi clans are collectively called Otamish...\\" Stuart estimated in 1881 the number of \\"Akhal Tekke\\" at \\"25,000 tents\\" and of \\"Merv Tekke\\" at \\"40,000 tents\\", which latter number included \\"Salor (5000 tents)\\". He estimated five people per tent, implying a total Teke tribal population of about 325,000 in that year. Today members of Teke tribe are predominantly found in the southeastern regions of Turkmenistan. They represent over a third of Turkmenistan's population (more than 1.6 million, ). Major tribes of Turkmenistan have mainly settled different parts of the country. Soviet policy on nationalities managed to diminish tribal identities in Turkmenistan, but the identities are still important in contemporary social contexts. Teke, and especially its subdivision Ahal Teke, have traditionally dominated Turkmenistan's political structure. Former President Saparmurat Niyazov was and current President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow is of the Ahal Teke tribe. Linguistics The linguist Larry Clark wrote, :\\"Teke dialect [is] spoken by members of the Teke tribe settled in the southern regions of Turkmenistan and along the northern skirt of the Köpetdag mountains, from Gizilarbat to the banks of the Murgap and Tejen rivers. This dialect has two subdialects: ::(a) Ahal: Tejen and Ashgabat districts up to Gizilarbat, including Büzmeyin, Gökdepe, Bäherdin, Bami and Goch districts. ::(b) Mari: Mari, Türkmengala, Sakarchäge, Murgap and Bayramali districts.\\" The official Turkmen language is based on the Ahal Teke and Mary Teke dialects. Stuart wrote in 1881, \\"The Turkomans speak a variety of Turki differing very little from the Turki spoken all over Northern Persia, and the Turks of Persia understand it, though there are some differences. The Persians call the Turki spoken by the Turkmans, Jagatai.\\" The common use of Chagatay as the Turkic lingua franca of Central Asia, however, changed under Soviet rule in 1924 when Russian became the common literary language of Central Asia and local dialects of Turkic languages were allowed to be used in publications. Initial efforts in the late 1920s and early 1930s to create a common literary Turkmen language incorporating elements of all major dialects failed when Joseph Stalin's purges resulted in death of the intellectuals involved. Following independence the political dominance of the Teke tribe led to de facto adoption of the Teke dialect as the standard for literary Turkmen speech and writing. As Clark put it, :\\"Standard Turkmen is regarded as their national language by all Turkmen living within Turkmenistan and, according to many Turkmen, by at least some of those living in nearby countries as well. This partly abstract standard language stands closest to the real language of the Teke dialect, and specifically of its Ahal subdialect spoken in the Ashgabat region, because many of the specialists who formulated the standard language in the 1930s were Ahal Teke, and the majority of officials, businessmen and intellectuals who routinely use the standard language, are Ahal Teke or live in Ashgabat.\\" Etymology Stuart asserted, \\"Tekke means wild goat. The word Tekke also is applied to the old he-goat that leads a flock of goats.\\" The modern definition of the word is \\"billy goat\\".

Its music was composed by Jun Satō, and its lyrics were written by Yasushi Akimoto.  Background  The song describes a school girl's desire to explore her sexuality. At the time of the single's release, Onyanko Club had 14 members. Lead vocalists (hereinafter referred to as \\"front vocals\\") for the single were Eri Nitta (number 4), Miharu Nakajima (number 5), Satomi Fukunaga (number 11) and Kazuko Utsumi (number 13). Of the 14 members, several members, such as Utsumi, Mika Nagoya (number 9) and Sanae Jounouchi (number 17), had experience in the performing arts prior to joining the group. Utsumi was selected as one of the front vocals because in the pre- Onyanko Club years she had taken vocal lessons at a music school established by Masaaki Hirao, who was a critically acclaimed singer-songwriter and music producer in the Japanese pop music industry. Also, certain members, namely Sayuri Kokusho (number 8), Sonoko Kawai (number 12) and Jounouchi, were left out of selection for front vocals because they already were under contract with CBS/Sony Records.
