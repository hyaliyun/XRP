Walk from Fremantle to Sydney De Brune left Fremantle, Western Australia on 24 November 1920 and walked to Sydney by way of Kalgoorlie, along the Trans-Australian Railway, and then via Adelaide and Melbourne, a distance of approximately 2800 miles. He walked along the railway line for most of his walk, unaccompanied and unassisted. He intended to walk the distance in eighty-five days. In the event he took 90 days, averaging about 30 miles, or 50km per day. He claimed some records for parts of his walk: *Fremantle to Kalgoorlie, 387 miles in 10¬Ω days; *Across Western Australia (Fremantle to Deakin), 841 miles in 24 days. *Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, via Trans-Australian Railway, 1051 miles in 46 days; *Nullarbor Plain, 400 miles, in 11¬Ω days; *Fremantle to Adelaide, 1710 miles, in 52 days; *Fremantle to Melbourne, 2199 miles, in 68 days; *Fremantle to Sydney, 2792¬Ω miles, in 90 days; *Adelaide to Melbourne, 489 miles, in 16 days; *Adelaide to Sydney, 1082 miles, in 38 days; *Melbourne to Sydney. 593¬Ω miles, in 22 days. Walk around Australia In September 1921 he began a walk around the perimeter of Australia, from Sydney to Sydney, anticlockwise. De Brune described his goal to be \\"to leave Sydney on foot, to walk ten thousand miles (more or less) around Australia, calling at all the ports en route on the four coasts, and to return to Sydney.\\"A Stroll Around Australia, The Moora Herald and Midland Districts Advocate, 8 June 1923. Retrieved 8 November 2018. He proposed taking twelve months to complete the walk. However, in the event, he took two and a half years, arriving back in Sydney on 4 March 1924. De Brune kept a diary during his walk, in which he made daily entries detailing the distance walked each day and the total distance to-date. He also invited people he met along the way to certify his presence at the location he was at and to make comments. After he finished his walk he donated the diary\\"Aidan Charles Francis De Brune trek round Australia, 20 September 1921 ‚Äì 1 September 1924.\\" State Library of New South Wales, Call No. B 692. and a typescript of the contents of the diary\\"Record diary of a walk around Australia.\\" State Library of New South Wales, Dewey: 980.1/D to the State Library of New South Wales. J T Beckett, a journalist, had met de Brune in Darwin, during de Brune's walk. A newspaper article written by Beckett appeared when de Brune was in Penong, South Australia, about 1700 miles from finishing his walk. Beckett concluded the article: \\"Aiden de Brune has not finished his walk but should he never move another yard further, he will have put up a record that few, if any, will ever attempt to equal.\\" Personal life De Brune was born Herbert Charles Cull in London, England and started his professional life as a printer. He married Ethel Elizabeth Crofts in 1907 and a son, Lionel, was born in 1909. In 1910 Cull went to Australia, arriving in Fremantle, Western Australia on 23 May 1910. His wife and child followed him and arrived in Albany, Western Australia on 26 November 1910. In 1912 Cull's wife and son returned to England. Cull remained in Australia for the rest of his life. In early 1920 he was working for the Bunbury Herald newspaper and wrote two serial stories: The Pursuits of Mr Peter Pell and The Mystery of the Nine Stars. The latter story was unfinished when, in November 1920, Cull left the newspaper and began to walk from Fremantle to Sydney, following the Trans- Australian Railway. When he reached Sydney, in early 1921, Cull was calling himself Aidan de Brune. After his walk around Australia, Aidan de Brune settled in Sydney and began writing serialised mystery stories for newspapers. Aidan de Brune/Herbert Charles Cull died in Sydney on 15 February 1946. His death was registered as that of Aidan de Brune. He was buried in Botany Cemetery.

Fur. 615; or ·ºôœÅŒºŒπ·ø∂ŒΩPeriplus of Pseudo-Scylax, p. 20.) was a town at the southern extremity of Argolis, in the wider use of this term, but an independent city during the Classical period of Greek history, and possessing a territory named Hermionis (·ºôœÅŒºŒπŒøŒΩŒØœÇ). The sea between the southern coast of Argolis and the island of Hydra was called after it the Hermionitic Gulf (; ), which was regarded as distinct from the Argolic and Saronic Gulfs. According to Greek mythology, Hermione was founded by the Dryopes, who are said to have been driven out of their original abodes on Mount Oeta and its adjacent valleys by Heracles, and to have settled in the Peloponnesus, where their three chief towns were Hermione, Asine, and E√Øon. Hermione is mentioned by Homer along with its kindred city Asine in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad. Asine and E√Øon were conquered at an early period by the Dorians, but Hermione continued to exist as an independent Dryopian state long afterwards. Hermione appears to have been the most important of the Dryopian towns, and to have been in possession at one time of a larger portion of the adjacent coast, as well as of several of the neighboring islands. Strabo, following ancient authorities, places the promontory Scyllaeum in Hermionis, and the Hermionitic Gulf extended along the coast of Troezen as far as this promontory. Hermione is mentioned first among the cities of the Amphictyony, the representatives of which were accustomed to meet in the adjacent island of Calaureia, from which it has been inferred that Hermione had the presidency of the confederacy, and that the island belonged to this city. It is expressly stated that Hydra belonged to the Hermionians, and that they surrendered this island to the Samian pirates, who gave it into the charge of the Troezenians. The Hermionians are mentioned as Dryopes at the time of the Greco-Persian Wars: they sent three ships to the Battle of Salamis, and 300 men to the Battle of Plataea. Subsequently the Argives took possession of Hermione, and settled there an Argive colony. There is no account of its conquest, and Pausanias supposes that the Argives obtained peaceable possession of the town; but it probably came into their power about the same time that they subdued Mycenae and Tiryns, 464 BCE. Some of the expelled Hermionians took refuge at Halieis, where the Tirynthians had also settled; and it was perhaps at this time that the lower city was deserted. Hermione now became a Doric city; but the inhabitants still retained some of the ancient Dryopian customs. Thus it continued to be the chief seat of the worship of Demeter Chthonia, who appears to have been the principal deity of the Dryopians; and we learn from a remarkable inscription that the Asinaeans, who had settled in Messenia after their expulsion from Argolis, continued to send offerings to Demeter Chthonia at Hermione.B√∂ckh, Inscr. no. 1193; Syll.¬≥ 1051 (English translation) Although Hermione had fallen into the hands of the Argives, it did not continue permanently subject to Argos, and it is mentioned subsequently as an independent town and an ally of Sparta. Around 230 BC the city was ruled by a tyrant named Xenon. The capture of the Acrocorinthus and the liberation of Argos by Aratus of Sicyon, however, convinced Xenon to voluntarily step down in 228 BC. He was the last tyrant of the Peloponnese to surrender his power. Hermione then joined the Achaean League and continued to exist long afterwards, as is evidenced by its numerous coins and inscriptions. Pausanias describes Hermione at considerable length. The old city, which was no longer inhabited in his time (2nd century), stood upon a promontory seven stadia in length, and three in breadth at its widest part; and on either side of this promontory there was a convenient harbour. There were still several temples standing on this promontory in the time of Pausanias, of which the most remarkable was one sacred to Poseidon. The later town, which Pausanias visited, stood at the distance of four stadia from this temple upon the slopes of the hill Pron. It was entirely surrounded by walls, and was in earlier times the acropolis of the city. The ruins lie about the modern village of Ermioni. Of the numerous temples mentioned by Pausanias the most important was the ancient Dryopian sanctuary of Demeter Chthonia, situated on a height of Mount Pron, said to have been founded by Chthonia, daughter of Phoroneus, and Clymenus her brother.Eur. Her. 615. It was an inviolable sanctuary; but it was plundered by Cilician pirates.Phot. Lex. s.v. ·ºôœÅŒºŒπœåŒΩŒ∑; Plut. Pomp. 24. Opposite this temple was one sacred to Clymenus and to the right was the stoa of Echo, which repeated the voice three times. In the same neighbourhood there were three sacred places surrounded with stone fences; one named the sanctuary of Clymenus, the second that of Hades, and the third that of the Acherusian lake. In the sanctuary of Clymenus there was an opening in the earth which the Hermionians believed to be the shortest road to Hades, and consequently they put no money in the mouths of their dead to pay the ferryman of the lower world. et seq.

They are all fictional characters that have appeared in more than one novel in the series. the stories move through real time and as such, some of the earlier novels are set in the Grampian Police are of responsibility, which later becomes Police Scotland. Police=Detective Inspector Logan \\"Lazarus\\" McRae= McRae was introduced in MacBride's first book in the series, \\"Cold Granite\\", as a detective sergeant. After being off work for a year recovering from serious stab wounds, he is soon labelled as \\"Lazarus\\" by his colleagues as he has risen from the deadIn the book, it is revealed that McRae actually died on the operating table, but was revived. McRae had been stabbed by the Mastrick Monster (Angus Robertson) who McRae has to interview in \\"Flesh House\\" about a suspect Robertson shared a cell with. In creating McRae, Macbride states that he wanted not just an anti- hero, but an anti anti-hero. McRae has been described as the \\"last bastion of sanity in the manic Aberdeen police department; [he is] surrounded by squabbling, heavy drinking, cursing and frequently incompetent fellow officers....\\" After the events of \\"Flesh House\\" (which while searching for a cannibal, led to McRae eating cooked human flesh), he became a vegetarian in \\"Blind Eye\\" the follow up novel. McRae donates sperm to his boss' wife (Susan) so that she can have a child. He ends up being 'father' to their two girls, Naomi and Jasmine. By the ninth book (\\"The Missing and the Dead\\"), McRae has been moved to rural Aberdeenshire (after he breaks police procedure in questioning a suspect) under what is termed a \\"development opportunity\\". After two stints in rural Aberdeenshire, McRae takes a job with Professional standards and appears briefly in \\"Now We Are Dead\\", before being back as centre story in \\"The Blood Road\\". =Detective Chief Inspector/Sergeant Roberta Steel= In the second book, \\"Dying Light\\", McRae is assigned to Detective Inspector Steel's \\"Screw-up Squad\\" after a botched raid that McRae organised, left one of his colleagues in a coma. Steel is overtly lesbian and obsessed with porn and other people's sex lives. She has an abrasive nature and has been described by some as being \\"wonderfully scabrous\\". In the books, she is always noted for her odd hairstyles and for fiddling constantly with her underwear. Louise Fairbairn, writing in The Scotsman, describes her as \\"The human tornado with a selection of ill-fitting bras...\\", and as one MacBride's \\"most beloved creations\\". It has been noted that Steel is more graphically described than McRae is and that she has \\"off-grey fillings and a yellow tongue‚Äù, exposes ‚Äúpale, hairy shins‚Äù when her trouser legs ride up, drinks whisky like there's no tomorrow and stuffs her face with sausage rolls. She's constantly digging into her cleavage to re-arrange her bra, which she swears is her girlfriend's, not hers.\\" Similarly, Sue Arnold, writing in The Guardian said of DI Steel that she was \\"[a] hard-drinking, chain-smoking, foul-mouthed but lovable lesbian...\\". Her use of language, descriptive and foul, is legendary within Grampian Police and later, Police Scotland. In \\"All That's Dead\\", Steel is quoted as saying \\"You'll no' see the bright side with your heid jammed up your arse\\". Something which prompts a detective inspector to comment wryly that she should hire herself out as a motivational speaker. After it is revealed that Steel fabricated evidence against an alleged rapist, she is investigated by Professional Standards (\\"In the Cold Dark Ground\\"), she is demoted to Detective Sergeant, but in the novel \\"Now We Are Dead\\", she is exonerated when it is found the alleged rapist was working in a team who gave him false alibis. By the third book after her demotion (\\"All That's Dead\\"), she is still a Detective Sergeant and working closely with McRae again. =Detective Sergeant Simon Rennie= Originally introduced as a detective constable, Rennie is a foil for most of the jokes and is seen as a bit of a loose chain in the link. He can be quite huffy and subscribes to New Scientist. He is the subject of much ridicule and in the second book \\"Dying Light\\" he is assigned to DI Steel's Screw-up Squad although he protests that as he has only just been made into a detective constable, he hasn't screwed up at all. Steel elucidates by saying that \\"everyone is here because they screwed up; you're here because you are expected to screw up\\". Despite this, it is later revealed during several raids that Rennie is quite accomplished with guns, much to everyones surprise. =Detective Inspector David Insch= Insch is McRae's immediate boss in some of their cases during the first four books. He is described as being overweight; he is always eating sweets and goes quite quickly from a shade of pink to purple. The after effects of the Flesh House case, see Insch leave the police after he attacks a prisoner. Insch appears in \\"Close to the Bone\\" when he is working as a production assistant at a media company. =Chief Superintendent Nigel Napier= Napier (also known as the \\"Ginger Ninja\\") works as the boss of professional standards and is always investigating Mcrae. It comes as a major surprise to McRae that Napier wishes him to transfer to professional standards as a DI during the events of \\"In the Cold Dark Ground\\". =WPC Jackie \\"Ball Breaker\\" Watson= Watson is first introduced in \\"Cold Granite\\" as an assistant for McRae (though it feels like babysitting for McRae). Watson is nicknamed \\"Ball-breaker\\", a fact that DI Insch warns McRae about (\\"they don't call her Ball Breaker for nothing\\") and by the second novel (\\"Dying Light\\") she has moved in with McRae. By the third book \\"Broken Skin\\", she is on DI Insch's team and actively pursuing a rapist. She assaults the suspected rapist more than once, causing him to be in a coma and precipitating the break-up of her relationship with McRae. Watson re- appears in \\"Flesh House\\" as a part on an internal review being carried out by Strathclyde Police into one of the Grampian Police's investigations and on \\"Close to the Bone\\" having a sexual affair with Logan while his girlfriend Samantha is in the hospital. =Detective Sergeant Bob \\"Biohazard Bob\\" Marshall= Bob works in CID alongside McRae and is famed for his telephone manner and breaking wind in the office =PC (later DC) Stewart \\"Tufty\\" Quirrel= Quirrel's first name begins with an 'S', hence the nickname. Tufty is introduced in the first book where McRae ends up in Banffshire (\\"The Missing and the Dead\\") and is later to be found working with Detective Sergeant Roberta Steel in \\"Now We Are Dead\\". Tufty is described as being \\"out of his depth\\" and, on account of his shyness (especially around women), the Pooh Bear to DCI Steel's Irascible Rabbit. =Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Finnie= Finnie ( also known as Frog-Face Finnie) is mentioned and has a small role in the first four books with a more prominent role in the fifth book, \\"Blind Eye\\" after DI Insch is sacked. =Detective Inspector Andy \\"Ding- Dong\\" Bell= Ding-Dong has some minor roles in the later books (with a more prominent role in \\"Now We Are Dead\\"), but in \\"The Blood Road\\", he is found dead in a car crash when he supposedly had already died two years earlier. Supporting=Isobel MacAlister= Isobel is a pathologist for Police Scotland based in Aberdeenshire (originally Grampian Police) who is the former lover of Logan McRae. Before the first book starts, her relationship with Logan has broken down and she has started a relationship with a journalist, Colin Miller. During Cold Granite, McRae realises that Isobel is giving Miller the inside track on some murder cases. =Samantha Mackie= A forensic technician who works for Grampian Police who is first introduced in \\"Flesh House\\" and who later becomes McRae's girlfriend. She is paralysed and left in a coma after a fire and during the events in \\"Shatter the Bones\\", and whilst she is comatose in hospital, McRae imagines having conversations with her. During his time in Banffshire, McRae is living in the police house and eating tinned soup so that he can afford to pay for her 24-hour care. At the end of \\"The Missing and the Dead\\" Samantha is kidnapped and half-drowned, which makes her seriously ill. She dies after McRae switches off her life support in the novel \\"In the Cold Dark Ground\\". =Colin Miller= A flashy journalist introduced in the first book, \\"Cold Granite\\" and who spars with McRae, but they end up being friends despite Miller setting up home with Isobel McAlister and Miller losing his fingers to torture by a gangster, an event that he holds McRae responsible for. Other characters=Sandy Moir-Farquharson= Also known as \\"Hissing Sid\\". A lawyer who frequently gets criminals off the charges laid against them by the Grampian Police (later Police Scotland). Moir- Farquharson is punched by a suspect which causes huge amounts of glee amongst the police officers especially DI Insch who acquires a video of it. Moir- Farquaharson is later engaged by McRae to defend DCI Steel when she is accused of fabricated evidence. His surname should be pronounced as \\"Facherson\\". =Wee Hamish Mowat= Hamish Alexander Selkirk Mowat is a local gangster whose chief enforcer is a \\"brute\\" called Reuben. Despite Mowat wanting them both to get along, Reuben and McRae regularly come to blows over who will take over Mowat's empire when he is gone (Mowat is on his deathbed in \\"In the Cold Dark Ground\\"). McRae does not want Mowat's empire or the money, but Mowat dearly wishes him to accept it, though that would have to be over Reuben's dead body. =Reuben Kennedy= Wee Hamish Mowat's chief enforcer; he and McRae regularly come to blows, especially in events of In the Cold Dark Ground when Wee Hamish dies and Reuben assumes control of the enterprise forcing McRae to get tough. =Susan= Steel's wife and birth mother to their two children. She is first heard of in \\"Dying Light\\" when Steel is talking to her on the phone. =Malcolm McLennan= Also known as Malk the Knife, is discussed in several books, but he only appears in one scene in \\"In the Cold Dark Ground\\" when he attends Wee Hamish Mowat's funeral. McLennan is a known gangster from Edinburgh who runs drugs, racketeering rings and sex workers.

Biography Andrej Dudrovich was born in Serbia, then part of the Austrian Empire before emigrating to Imperial Russia. Like many intellectuals of his generation who received an education abroad, he became influenced by Immanuel Kant's moral teachings. His chief work was a doctoral dissertation dealing with Kant while in the class of Johann Baptist Schad (1758-1834), a Benedictine monk who converted to Protestanism and became one of Kant's desciples in Imperial Russia. Dudrovich was a teacher at the Kharkov gymnasium, and from 1813 he was invited at Kharkov University, first as a lecturer in the department of logic, ethics or moral philosophy and natural law. The following year (1814) he published his doctoral dissertation -- \\"De philosophiae genuino conceptu nec non necessitate ejus absoluta\\" (The philosophy is not true concept and its absolute necessity) under the watchful eye of Johann Schad, his mentor. Dudrovich held that our empirical representations are inconsistent. Since things in themselves cannot be so, \\"in all probability\\" these contradictions must lie in our representations. Since reason, which is one and the same, albeit with theoretical and practical function, rejects the very possibility of knowing things in themselves, it, in its practical function, cannot convince us of their reality. Thus, all knowledge is a mere mental game, a fantasy, and in fact we truly know nothing. We do not want to know things simply appear to us; what we want to know is how things are in themselves. Timofei Fedorovic Osipovsky and other scientists at Kharkov found themselves at odds with their Kantian philosophers, particularly Atanasije Stojkoviƒá and Schad. Commenting on a physics textbook by his colleague Stojkovich in 1814, Osipovsky objected to the way it was arranged corresponding to the order of Kant's categories. Stojkovich was not the first to leave Kharkov, though it had little or nothing to do with Kantian convictions. Later, with Johann Schad's forced departure, the chair in philosophy remained unoccupied for three years until August 1819 when Dudrovich was named extraordinary professor and invited to the chair of philosophy. There, for the next 14 years he lectured on logic, psychology, metaphysics, natural law, and the history of philosophy. Dudrovich succeeded Schad in teaching philosophy at Kharkov, even though president Timofei Osipovsky of Kharkov University opposed Dudrovich who was the dean of the departments and later rector just as intensely as he had Schad. Osipovsky was the principal opponent of German idealism in all its form but especially of Kant, and of Stojkovich and Schad for that matter. In 1830, Osipovsky came into conflict with the Minister of Religious Affairs and Education (Alexander Nikolayevich Golitsyn of the House of Golitsyn) and was eventually dismissed. Dudrovich was named president of Kharkov University. He died in Kharkov in 1830. From the printed works of Dudrovich, except for his book, only one of his speeches remain, originally delivered at a solemn university meeting on August 30, 1815: \\"De studii academiae natur\\" in Latin or \\"The nature of university study\\".

After serving in a variety of posts in the Komsomol, she rose through the ranks of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and became a deputy in the Supreme Soviet from 1958 to 1974. Between 1959 and 1970, she was the Deputy Chair of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and subsequently the chair of the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet until 1974. She was purged from the Communist Party in 1988 after the death of Leonid Brezhnev (1906‚Äì1982) and during the corruption investigations in the . She was rehabilitated and restored to party membership in 1991, when the allegations of bribery against her could not be substantiated. Nasriddinova was awarded the Order of Lenin four times over the course of her career, as well as twice receiving the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. Early life Yodgor Sadykovna Nasriddinova was born on 26 December 1920 in Kokand, of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Her father, who was a loader, died three months before her birth and her 13-year-old mother named her \\"Yodgor\\", a name common in Muslim countries given to male or female orphans. She and her mother were forced to move by Nasriddinova's grandfather, who took them to another village 50 kilometers away from their home. Nasriddinova's mother remarried, but her new step-father wanted nothing to do with the child. Four years after her birth the Turkestan Autonomous SSR was divided, with the area of her birth being within the newly created Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. At the age of six, her stepfather took Nasriddinova to the side of the road and abandoned her. She was taken in by sympathetic passersby and passed from family to family until she was 11. In 1931, when the first orphanage was built in Uzbekistan, she was placed in its care and sent to study in a vocational school. She furthered her education, graduating from the Tashkent Institute of Railway Transport Engineers in 1941. Career From October 1941, Nasriddinova was employed as an engineer on the Tashkent Railway, simultaneously continuing her graduate studies at the Tashkent Institute. She worked as a foreman on the Katta-Kurgan Reservoir project and the following year she headed the crew which built the rail line between Tashkent and the Angrenugol Mine. Joining the communist party in 1942, she became the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol for Uzbek schools. Around this time, she became the second wife of (Sirodzh Nurutdinov), a war veteran and secretary of the regional party committee, who would later serve as chairman of the trade unions of Uzbekistan. Nuritdinov, was a political rival of Sharof Rashidov, based largely on an alliance over leadership positions between Uzbek elites from Tashkent and Ferghana, which emerged when the capital of Uzbekistan was moved in 1930 from Samarkand, the regional center of Rashidov's heritage. In 1946, she was appointed as the First Secretary of the Komsomol for the Tashkent Regional Committee of Uzbekistan. Graduating in 1947, she continued to rise in the Komsomol and district party holding various posts. In 1952, she headed the Ministry of Industry of Uzbekistan. Three years later, she was selected as deputy chair of the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek SSR and then in 1959 became Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR, succeeding Sharof Rashidov. Simultaneously, in 1959, she was elected as the Deputy chair of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Tensions between Rashidov and Nasriddinova had continued and after the ethnic riots of 1969, Rashidov saw a way to banish his rival by blaming her supporters for fomenting violence and security lapses. In turn, her faction blamed Rashidov, but it was Nasriddinova, who would soon leave Uzbekistan. Moving to Moscow in 1970, she became the Chair of the Soviet of Nationalities of the USSR. After Nasriddinova left Uzbekistan, Rashidov was able to widen his networks through the use of patronage, to co-opt rivals into loyal backers. He consolidated his power, by posting family and friends to high government positions and distributing resources. At the end of her term in 1974, Nikolai Podgorny, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, asked her if she wanted to retain the post. When she agreed to serve, he nominated her for consideration to the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but Rashidov, who was her political rival and at that time First Secretary of the Uzbek Communist Party, blocked the nomination, claiming that he had evidence she was involved in corruption. The central committee did not investigate at that time, but her appointment as the Deputy Minister for the USSR Building Materials Industry in 1974 and as the Chair of the Committee for Asian and African Affairs were clear signs of her decline in the favor of the party. In 1979, Nasriddinova retired, but did not return to Uzbekistan, as both of her children were living in Moscow and her husband had died in 1966. Over the course of her career, she had been awarded the Order of Lenin four times, the Order of the Red Banner of Labour twice, the Order of the Badge of Honour, among others. In 1982 Brezhnev died and Rashidov died the following year, opening the door to new investigation of the corruption which had occurred during their leadership. In 1983, and began investigating what would become known as the . They discovered records indicating that had been convinced of Nasriddinova's involvement and that intervention by Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee had stopped her arrest in 1975. Nasriddinova first learned of the investigation when the newspaper Izvestia published an article in 1987. In the article, she was accused of having taken a bribe of ‚ÇΩ100,000 and routing gold to Swiss banks, while she was the Chair of the Uzbek Presidium. Investigative journalist, Arkady Sakhnin, alleged that Nasriddinova also paid for her son‚Äôs lavish wedding with state funds, which prompted a scolding from Brezhnev, but no further action against her. In 1988, the accusations Rashidov had made in 1977 resurfaced with formal charges and she was stripped of her party membership and pension. In December 1990, they were dropped citing insufficient evidence against Nasriddinova. In 1991, she was rehabilitated, restored to party membership, and paid the pension for the 2 1/2 years it had been suspended. Nasriddinova insisted she had never been involved, that witnesses had fabricated testimony against her, and demanded that Izvestia print her answer denying all the allegations in their article. Death and legacy Nasriddinova died in Moscow on 7 April 2006 and was buried in the Kuntsevo Cemetery.

He later modified the spelling of both his middle name and surname.Australian Dictionary of Biography, William Mogford Hamlet. Hamlet was educated at a private school in Bristol where he gained some knowledge of chemistry and electricity. He also visited the laboratories of scientists which strengthened his interest in the subjects.Sydney Morning Herald, 19 November 1931, p 10. Accessed 9 November 2018. He was apprenticed to a shipping firm in Bristol. However, he continued his scientific studies and attended the Bristol trade and mining school in the evenings, where he received the Queen's medal for inorganic chemistry. He gained a scholarship, which enabled him to proceed to the Royal College of Chemistry, where he studied under Sir Edward Frankland, After an appointment as demonstrator of chemistry at the Bristol Medical School, he entered into a contract with the Bristol agents of the Peruvian Government to analyse the consignments of natural Peruvian guano, then imported from the Chincha Islands and Gua√±ape Islands. Hamlet next received an appointment as official public analyst for the town of Kings Lynn and later fitted up a research laboratory for a large London brewery. He proceeded to the West Indies as chemist and assayer for a gold-mining company, however, he was obliged to return to England owing to illness. He was advised to proceed to Australia for health reasons, and arrived in Sydney on 14 February 1884 where he was employed as a lecturer in chemistry for the Department of Education (New South Wales) and later as Assistant to the Government Analyst. In 1887, he was appointed Government analyst of New South Wales and retained the role until his retirement in 1915. Hamlet was a member of the following bodies: * Fellow of the Chemical Society of London (1875). * Member of the Royal Society of New South Wales (1887), serving on its council in 1891-1915 and president in 1899-1900 and 1908-09. * Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain (1888). * President of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, section B, chemistry and mineralogy (1892). On 19 April 1887 Hamlet married English-born Ada Murray. They had five children. The family lived at Mosman, New South Wales and later at Glenbrook, New South Wales. Hamlet was a keen recreational walker. In 1895 he was a co-founder of the Warragamba Walking Club, of which his friends Professor John Le Gay Brereton and Henry J. Tompkins were also members. In 1908, 1912 and 1914 he undertook three walking tours along the east coast of Australia. Accounts of these walks appeared under the title, \\"Pictures of Travel,\\" in The Sydney Morning Herald, during 1908, 1912 and 1914.Pictures of Travel, Walking Tours Along the East Coast of New South Wales. Hamlet was a small man, with a mustache and beard. He was widely read and was an accomplished organist.

It was produced by Jo Durden-Smith for Granada TV and directed by John Sheppard and first aired in the United Kingdom on 4 October 1968. The programme combines footage of the Doors playing live at London's Roundhouse venue, interviews with the band members and contemporary news snippets of world current affairs - protests at the 1968 Democratic Convention, French riots, statements from politicians and footage of the war in Vietnam etc. Production The Doors arrived in England on 3 September 1968 for the start of 17-date European tour (with concerts in London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm). The day the group arrived they are filmed answering questions as they come through customs at Heathrow airport and also about their music on the drive from the airport to their London hotel, the Royal Lancaster. On 4 September the band are interviewed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in central London. The ICA was hosting an exhibition by Jasia Reichardt called Cybernetic Serendipity. The group is also filmed being interviewed at Polydor Records office in London and possibly at Jim Morrison's London flat he shared with girlfriend Pamela Courson. On 5 September the group lip-synced to their hit Hello, I Love You on Top of the Pops. The group were booked to play four shows over two days - Friday the 6th and Saturday the 7th - at the Roundhouse in London. Both concerts on the Friday were filmed by Granada's Outside Broadcasting Unit for the television documentary. A soundcheck (which Jim Morrison missed) was also recorded with a rendition of Hello, I Love You sung by Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger performing an instrumental section from Little Red Rooster. The two Friday shows are filmed by four cameras - stage left and right plus a two cameras moving across the front of the stage. However a video problem meant this filming was unusable and so the cameras returned for the shows on the Saturday. The recording of the second set did not begin until one o'clock in the morning following a mammoth two-and-a-half set by the Jefferson Airplane. The band played 17 songs, not all of which featured in the documentary. The Doors followed Jefferson Airplane on the Friday and then supported them the following day. The documentary utilises only footage from the second Saturday concert. The documentary aired on 4 October 1968. The final documentary was entitled The Doors Are Open but according to Greg Shaw in his book On The Road, it was originally to be called \\"When The Mode Of The Music Changes, The Walls Of The City Will Shake\\".

Animation and distributed by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, and the thirty-second entry in the direct-to-video series of Scooby-Doo films. The film is a continuation of the 1985 animated series The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, designed to provide resolution for the show's unfinished storyline. The film was released on DVD and digital on February 5, 2019. Plot A prologue set before The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo depicts a young Vincent Van Ghoul and his partner Mortifer hunting down and successfully sealing the final ghost into the Chest of Demons. Mortifer, however, is attacked and seemingly killed by minion ghosts as a tearful Vincent makes his escape. In the opening credits, Vincent recaps the events of The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo in which the titular dog eventually set the ghosts free once more but would catch all but one with the help of his friends Daphne and Shaggy. In the present day at Old Timey Toys, Mystery Inc. is forced to retire from solving mysteries after catching a teenager-fearing Farmer Morgan and largely due to the ungrateful sheriff telling them they could be arrested for \\"criminal negligence\\". In addition, Old Timey Toys' owner Mrs. Malvo was handcuffed outside for trying to stop a deal with Farmer Morgan. The following day, they hold a garage sale and sell items from their old mysteries, even the Mystery Machine, leaving Fred depressed. They then discover the crystal ball that Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby used to contact Van Ghoul during their ghost recapturing adventures. At that moment, their old friend Van Ghoul contacts the gang about the final ghost. Daphne fills Fred and a skeptical Velma in, and unveils the red van dubbed the Misstery Machine, and the gang start on their journey to meet Van Ghoul. On their way to his estate, they are chased by a phantom car but Daphne manages to skillfully outmaneuver it. Seeing Daphne take charge only furthers Fred's existential crisis as he feels he is without a role. The gang meet Van Ghoul, but are all attacked by the thirteenth ghost: a hulking, winged demon-like creature named Asmodeus. Shaggy reveals that he sent the chest to Van Ghoul's residence in the Himalayas and the gang travels there using a flying boat. Upon arrival, they spot Bernie Alan who inquired about the crystal ball at the garage sale. Daphne, Van Ghoul, Scooby, and Shaggy tail him but are attacked by the phantom car again which uses its revving engine to create an avalanche. Vincent finds he is unable to use his magic and the four crash into a temple. Meanwhile, Fred and Velma search a seemingly abandoned post office and unknowingly meet an adult Flim-Flam who tries to sell them Chest of Demons merchandise and ghost-catching equipment. They leave but are snatched up by something even Velma can't explain and she comes to the conclusion that it must have been real ghosts. Asmodeus had been waiting for Van Ghoul and chases the four when they find the chest. Van Ghoul breaks his crystal ball and somehow transports the kids outside the temple where they meet Velma and Fred. Fred cheers for his despondent team and a restored Daphne conducts a plan. Velma visits Flim- Flam's store and takes everything. She, Fred, and Flim-Flam are once again pursued by the phantom car but are able to evade capture with the Misstery Machine's upgrades installed. Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby infiltrate the castle to help Van Ghoul and reunite with Flim-Flam, Velma, and Fred. They find Van Ghoul defeated. He reveals that Asmodeus is the demon form of his magically powerful ancestor Asomad Van Ghoul and thus blames the impending doom on himself. Asmodeus opens the Chest of Demons, something that Velma points out as being impossible, as the Chest can only be opened by the living. Asmodeus tries to run but is intercepted by Daphne and revealed as Mortifer. Mortifer wanted to sell the Chest to Alan for $10 million. but Alan reveals himself as an international agent and arrests Mortifer. However, he begins to escape in the phantom car, only to be recaptured. A visage of the real Asmodeus and Asomad briefly appears. Velma deduces from a tome that the real Asmodeus was actually watching over Van Ghoul and has achieved redemption. However, she fabricated this story to give Van Ghoul closure. She debunks the phenomenon of the first twelve ghosts as hallucinations, her own close encounter at a ski lift, and teases opening the real Chest of Demons. However, upon seeing the gang's fearful faces, she decides not to. The gang decides to continue solving mysteries.

The Habitant token were a series of tokens that were created for use primarily within Lower Canada and were issued in 1837. Produced as a successor to the popular bouquet sous, these tokens depicted a Habitant on the obverse, a traditional depiction of a French-Canadian farmer in winter clothing, and the coat of arms for the City of Montreal on the reverse. The tokens were issued in both one penny/deux sous and half penny/un sou denominations by the leading commercial banks of Montreal. They were issued in large numbers and can be easily acquired by the modern collector, though some varieties are rare and command a premium. These tokens replaced the popular bouquet sous that the banks of Lower Canada had previously introduced into circulation. The Habitant tokens were known to still be in use over 60 years after they were originally issued,Faulkner p. 87 and are known from archaeological evidence to have circulated in Upper Canada as well.Kleeberg p 165-166 These tokens are classified as \\"semi-regal\\" by Canadian numismatists, as they were authorized by the colonial government.Grawey2019 p 12 History In 1837 the Bank of Montreal applied for permission from Britain to import copper tokens to a value of ¬£5,000. Permission was granted, but only on the condition that the other major commercial banks of Montreal also participated.Cross p. 97 The other banks agreed, and an order was placed with the minting firm Boulton and Watt to produce the tokens,Willey 136 each containing the name of the issuing bank on a ribbon contained on the reverse of the token. The Bank of Montreal paid ¬£2,000 for the production of these tokens, and the other three Montreal banks--City Bank of Montreal, The Quebec Bank and La Banque du Peuple-- ¬£1,000 apiece.Willey 136 The ¬£5,000 (paid in Sterling), was for the cost of production of the tokens, which amounted to roughly ¬£7,700 of half pennies and pennies being produced against the Halifax rating, the money standard used in Lower Canada at the time.Willey 136 From these figures it has been estimated that roughly 1.8 million half pennies and just over 900,000 pennies were minted.Willey 136 The tokens arrived in Lower Canada in four separate shipments, beginning in late May 1838 and ending in late 1839.Willey 136 While the tokens were originally intended to be struck at five-sixths of the weight of British copper coins, they were struck at full weight instead, making them more substantial than the bouquet sous they were designed to replace, and closer to their actual value in copper.Willey 136 Another common name for this series of tokens was the \\"Papineau\\", named after Louis-Joseph Papineau. He was the leader of the reformist Patriote movement before the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837‚Äì1838 and was well-known for wearing habitant clothing almost as uniform.Banning 18 While including an image of an habitant as an emblem of Lower Canada was intended, it is highly unlikely that the established banks of Montreal (and particularly the politically conservative Bank of Montreal) meant their token to be identified with Papineau, with one numismatist remarking that \\"the connection between them and the great statesman is purely sentimental\\".Courteau 1 These tokens circulated long after they were originally issued, and were alluded to in an Order in Council from the Minister of Finance in August 1870: > \\"while bronze cents and the Copper coins of the United Kingdom alone are > legal tender, the principal Copper Currency consists of Bank tokens of the > Bank of Montreal, Bank of Upper Canada, Quebec Bank & Banque du Peuple, all > of which are of good quality, and all authorized by law. That these coins > are only current at the rates of a half penny & a penny old Currency, while > postage & other stamps are in cents. That it is essentially necessary to > establish a uniform Copper Currency, and after much consideration he is of > opinion that if the Government would instruct its Departments to receive the > Bank tokens at one and two Cents respectively, the public would do so > likewise, and by this means a great deal of the inconvenience would be > removed.\\"http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/orders/001022-119.01-e.php?&sisn;_id_nbr=3929&page;_sequence_nbr=1&interval;=50&&PHPSESSID;=id650s0nq4m6s19o0vdrjs9gc6 The following year (1871) the Uniform Currency Act received royal assent, which set the denominations for Canadian currency officially against a decimal-based dollar.http://coinhistory.info/canada/ =Later Production of Muled Varieties= In 1850, London engraver W.J. Taylor purchased a number of coining tools and dies from the Soho Mint, where the original Habitant tokens (along with many subsequent Lower Canadian issues) had been created. He started to create a number of restrikes of coins using the original dies. All of the varieties he produced were mules, containing the reverse from one coin design matched with the obverse of another. He is known to have created mules using the reverse of the 1837 Habitant token and the obverse of the later \\"Front View\\" Bank of Montreal penny from 1842 in copper, brass, and silver.Heritage_2018 119 Design Detail of an image of an \\"habitant\\" on the back of a Banque Canadienne One Dollar bill from the early 19th century. The design for the Habitant on the obverse of the coin was designed by James Duncan,Bell 6 and was originally used on the back of a Banque Canadienne one dollar bill, the design engraved by Rawden, Wright and Hatch of New York.Willey 136 The image depicts the Habitant wearing traditional winter clothing, including a touque, a hooded frock coat, moccasins, and a \\"ceinture flechee\\" sash.Courteau 1 He also holds a whip in his right hand.Willey 136 Above him is the legend \\"PROVINCE DU BAS CANADA\\" and the value, either \\"UN SOU\\" or \\"DEUX SOUS\\", below. First coat of arms (1833) for the City of Montreal The reverse features the original design of the coat of arms for the city of Montreal, as designed by Mayor Jacques Viger and the city council in 1833. A large Saint Andrew's Cross divides the shield into four segments, and in each of these spaces a heraldic symbol representing different settler populations: at top, a rose for the English heritage of the population, a thistle for the Scots, a sprig of clover to represent the Irish, and at bottom a beaver for the French that originally settled the territory and traded in furs. The motto surrounding the shield says \\"CONCORDIA SALUS\\", a Latin phrase meaning \\"salvation through harmony\\". A ribbon bearing the name of the issuing bank appears on a ribbon that flows across the base of the coat of arms.Grawey2019 12 The words \\"BANK TOKEN\\" appears at the top, \\"HALF PENNY or \\"ONE PENNY\\" at the bottom, along with the issue date of 1837. Numismatic Study Early Canadian numismatist Pierre-Napol√©on Breton illustrates both the half penny and penny varieties of these tokens in his book Illustrated History of Coins and Tokens Relating to Canada, originally published in 1890.Breton1894 p. 5 Despite the fact that there were four varieties of each type of token based on the bank they were issued from, Breton gave the number 521 to all of the pennies, and 522 to all of the half pennies.Breton1894 p. 37-38 At least one later catalog appends letters to Breton's numbering (i.e. 521, 521a, 521b, and 521c) to represent tokens from each of the banks.Stanley p 4 The first detailed study of the series and its variants was The Habitant Tokens of Lower Canada (Province of Quebec) written by Canadian numismatist Eugene Courteau, published in 1927.

Trajectory inference or pseudotemporal ordering is a computational technique used in single-cell transcriptomics to determine the pattern of a dynamic process experienced by cells and then arrange cells based on their progression through the process. Single-cell protocols have much higher levels of noise than bulk RNA-seq, so a common step in a single-cell transcriptomics workflow is the clustering of cells into subgroups. Clustering can contend with this inherent variation by combining the signal from many cells, while allowing for the identification of cell types. However, some differences in gene expression between cells are the result of dynamic processes such as the cell cycle, cell differentiation, or response to an external stimuli. Trajectory inference seeks to characterize such differences by placing cells along a continuous path that represents the evolution of the process rather than dividing cells into discrete clusters. In some methods this is done by projecting cells onto an axis called pseudotime which represents the progression through the process. __TOC__  Methods  Since 2015, more than 50 algorithms for trajectory inference have been created. Although the approaches taken are diverse there are some commonalities to the methods. Typically, the steps in the algorithm consist of dimensionality reduction to reduce the complexity of the data, trajectory building to determine the structure of the dynamic process, and projection of the data onto the trajectory so that cells are positioned by their evolution through the process and cells with similar expression profiles are situated near each other. Trajectory inference algorithms differ in the specific procedure used for dimensionality reduction, the kinds of structures that can be used to represent the dynamic process, and the prior information that is required or can be provided. PCA of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The vectors shown are the first (longer vector) and second principal components, which indicate the directions of maximum variance. = Dimensionality Reduction = The data produced by single-cell RNA-seq can consist of thousands of cells each with expression levels recorded across thousands of genes. In order to efficiently process data with such high dimensionality many trajectory inference algorithms employ a dimensionality reduction procedure such as principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), or t-SNE as their first step. The purpose of this step is to combine many features of the data into a more informative measure of the data. For example, a coordinate resulting from dimensionality reduction could combine expression levels from many genes that are associated with the cell cycle into one value that represents a cell's position in the cell cycle. Such a transformation corresponds to dimensionality reduction in the feature space, but dimensionality reduction can also be applied to the sample space by clustering together groups of similar cells. = Trajectory Building = A graph with six vertices. Many trajectory inference algorithms use graphs to build the trajectory. Many methods represent the structure of the dynamic process via a graph-based approach. In such an approach the vertices of the graph correspond to states in the dynamic process, such as cell types in cell differentiation, and the edges between the nodes correspond to transitions between the states. The creation of the trajectory graph can be accomplished using k-nearest neighbors or minimum spanning tree algorithms. The topology of the trajectory refers to the structure of the graph and different algorithms are limited to creation of graph topologies of a particular type such as linear, branching, or cyclic. = Use of prior information = Some methods require or allow for the input of prior information which is used to guide the creation of the trajectory. The use of prior information can lead to more accurate trajectory determination, but poor priors can lead the algorithm astray or bias results towards expectations. Examples of prior information that can be used in trajectory inference are the selection of start cells that are at the beginning of the trajectory, the number of branches in the trajectory, and the number of end states for the trajectory.  Software = Monocle = Monocle first employs a differential expression test to reduce the number of genes then applies independent component analysis for additional dimensionality reduction. To build the trajectory Monocle computes a minimum spanning tree, then finds the longest connected path in that tree. Cells are projected onto the nearest point to them along that path. = p-Creode = p-Creode finds the most likely path through a density-adjusted k-nearest neighbor graph. Graphs from an ensemble are scored with a graph similarity metric to select the most representative topology. p-Creode has been tested on a range of single-cell platforms, including mass cytometry, multiplex immunofluorescence, and single-cell RNA-seq. No prior information is required. = Slingshot = Slingshot takes cluster labels as input and then orders these clusters into lineages by the construction of a minimum spanning tree. Paths through the tree are smoothed by fitting simultaneous principal curves and a cell's pseudotime value is determined by its projection onto one or more of these curves. Prior information, such as initial and terminal clusters, is optional. = TSCAN = TSCAN performs dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis and clusters cells using a mixture model. A minimum spanning tree is calculated using the centers of the clusters and the trajectory is determined as the longest connected path of that tree. TSCAN is an unsupervised algorithm that requires no prior information. = Wanderlust/Wishbone = Wanderlust was developed for analysis of mass cytometry data, but has been adapted for single-cell transcriptomics applications. A k-nearest neighbors algorithm is used to construct a graph which connects every cell to the cell closest to it with respect to a metric such as Euclidean distance or cosine distance. Wanderlust requires the input of a starting cell as prior information. Wishbone is built on Wanderlust and allows for a bifurcation in the graph topology, whereas Wanderlust creates a linear graph. Wishbone combines principal component analysis and diffusion maps to achieve dimensionality reduction then also creates a KNN graph. = Waterfall = Waterfall performs dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis and uses a k-means algorithm to find cell clusters. A minimal spanning tree is built between the centers of the clusters. Waterfall is entirely unsupervised, requiring no prior information, and produces linear trajectories.

He is serving a twelve-year sentence in federal prison in the United States. Early life  Li was born in Chengdu, China in 1979.  Career  From Chengdu, he operated \\"CRACK99\\", a website that sold stolen software globally from 2008 until his arrest by U.S. authorities in 2011. During that time, he sold over $100 million in industrial-grade software, the access controls of which had been circumvented by software cracking. The software had civilian and military applications, including aerospace and aviation simulation and design, communications systems design, electromagnetic simulation, explosives simulation, intelligence analysis, precision tooling, oil field management, and manufacturing plant design.  Operation, Arrest and Prosecution =Investigation= One of the software titles for sale on CRACK99 was ‚ÄúSatellite Tool Kit 8.0‚Äù (‚ÄúSTK‚Äù), now known as Systems Tool Kit, designed by Analytical Graphics Incorporated (AGI) to enable the U.S. military to simulate missile launches and flight trajectories of aircraft and satellites. AGI brought this fact to the attention of U.S. Department of Homeland Security Investigations in December 2009. A team of prosecutors and agents from the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service initiated an undercover investigation in 2010. As part of that investigation, federal agents purchased STK software from the CRACK99 website, as well as other advanced software used in spacecraft design and programmable logic devices. =Lurement and arrest in Saipan= U.S. undercover agents posed as criminals who were reselling software obtained from CRACK99. Li and the agents engaged in lengthy email and Skype conversations about increasing sales by expanding the U.S. market. Ultimately, Li agreed to meet the agents in Saipan to discuss future business opportunities. On June 6, 2011, Li met with undercover agents in Saipan. Li provided agents with 20 gigabytes of proprietary data hacked from a defense contractor. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the database,‚Äù explained Li, ‚ÄúI was thinking [it] would be difficult to pass through the custom.‚Äù This data included military and civilian aircraft image models, a software module containing data associated with the International Space Station, and a high resolution, 3-dimensional imaging program. Li further advised the undercover agents: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just sell it ‚Ä¶ randomly! ‚Ä¶ Only the familiar and reliable customers‚Ä¶ The products‚Ä¶are pretty‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶like confidential. [Don‚Äôt]‚Ä¶ go and tell other people.‚Äù The agents asked if Xiang Li could get software in addition to what he had listed on CRACK99. ‚ÄúI mean as long as [you] can tell me the name,‚Äù Li said, ‚ÄúI could find a way to get it ....‚Äù Xiang Li asked the agents: ‚ÄúI want to ask a question. ‚Ä¶ Will [your] customers be able to find me? Will [they] be also contacting me? ‚Ä¶. Will [the customers] be able to locate me?‚Äù Shortly thereafter, Li was arrested, waived his right to remain silent, and confessed to his crimes. =Conviction= A federal grand jury indicted Li on multiple federal charges involving the sale of more than $100 million in stolen software. The $100 million figure was based on the results from search warrants executed on Xiang Li's email accounts, which revealed about 600 illegal transactions between April 2008 and August 2010. In January 2013, the federal district court in Delaware accepted Li's guilty plea to one count each of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, exposing him to a maximum of 25 years of incarceration. In June 2013, the court held a sentencing hearing. Li contended that software piracy was ‚Äúprevalent‚Äù in China, opining that ‚Äú[p]robably ten million people in China are doing things illegally with software.‚Äù The U.S. government agreed that cyber theft is prevalent in China, but contended that the prevalence of Chinese piracy is not a defense, and pointed the court to a report estimating that China's illegal software market reached $9 billion in 2011, out of a total market of nearly $12 billion, thus setting a piracy rate of 77 percent. The government emphasized the advanced nature of the software sold by Li and the fact that many of the software products had military applications. The court noted ‚Äúthe extensive amount of crime that the defendant was engaged in, finding: ‚ÄúThis was nothing less than a crime spree, and it was brazen.‚ÄùSentencing Transcript at 46, United States v. Xiang Li, 10-112-LPS pp. 57, 60 The court found that the software was ‚Äúhighly sophisticated‚Äù and ‚Äúended up with individuals and sometimes in countries that are not authorized to have those software materials\\". The court sentenced Li to 12 years in prison, the longest criminal copyright sentence ever imposed. The Xiang Li case was featured in the CNN series Declassified. American customers Li sold software worth over $600,000 to Dr. Ronald Best, the ‚ÄúChief Scientist‚Äù of a U.S. defense contractor involved in applications such as radio communication, radar, and microwave technology. Best used the cracked software to design components for Patriot missiles and radar for Marine One (the President's helicopter) and the Army's Blackhawk helicopter. Another U.S. customer was Cosburn Wedderburn, who purchased over $1,000,000 in stolen software. At the time, Wedderburn was a NASA engineer.

Biography  Jal Magal in Narnaul, which was built by Shah Quli Khan in the late 16th century Quli Khan was a member of the governing class of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. As a young man, Quli was a protegee of Bairam Khan, a powerful noble who served as the regent of the Mughal Empire during the early reign of Akbar the Great. Quli's connection to Bairam Khan allowed him to curry an extensive amount of favor with the Mughal court. In the 1550s, a series of wars broke out between the Mughals and the Sur Empire. Quli Khan was deployed with the Mughal army during the war, and distinguished himself during the conflicts. During the pivotal Second Battle of Panipat in 1556, Quli fought against and wounded Hemu, the commander of the Sur army. The battle was a decisive victory for the Mughal empire, and Emperor Akbar commended Quli for his role in the victory, showering him with wealth, titles, and land. In the 1570s, Quli Khan was named as the Mughal governor of Narnaul.Alexander Mikaberidze, (2011). Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World a Historical Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara: ABC- CLIO. p. 707. . As governor, Quli began a massive construction program across the territory. His first major project was to construct a tomb in his own honor. The tomb, which has been cited as an excellent example of Mughal architectural style, was built between 1774 and 1775. The tomb featured a planned garden, and was part of Quli's gubernatorial estate. Fifteen years after building his tomb, Quli Khan began constructing a palace for himself. This building would become known as the Jal Mahal. The palace was built in the middle of an artificial lake, and is adorned with art and carvings. One such carving was done in such a way as to praise Quli Khan's victory over Hemi some forty years earlier. Upon his death, Quli Khan (who was known for his generosity) donated much of his wealth to his courtiers; it has also been posited that this donation was a way to circumvent the inheritance laws of the Mughal empire.

The city, an Esan tribe, stretches through the highlands and plains of central Edo State. It is 120 kilometres north of Benin City, the capital of Edo State, having boundaries with Ekpoma in the west, Ukhun in the south, Ewu in the east and Agbede in the north. Residents are mainly farmers and grow crops, including yams, rice, cassava, taro and cocoa. The city of Idoa is currently made up of the following five clans: Afuku-N'Edo, Afokolo, Atologua, Ubi and Ofie. Religion Idoa mosque St Peters Anglican Church, Idoa Idoa people were originally herbalists. During the reign of Ifidon in the late 1890s, Islamic Religion was introduced to the community with the assistance of Oba Momodu I of Agbede. The first mosque was built in 1918. Today, Islam, Christianity and other religions are present in the community. History of Idoa Kingdom In 1460 AD, Oba Ewuare passed laws of mourning that prohibited sexual intercourse, bathing, drumming, dancing, and cooking. These laws proved too restrictive for many citizens, and these citizens fled the kingdom to Esanland. This exodus shaped Esanland's modern cultural identity and gave rise to the term \\"Esan,\\" or \\"refugee.\\" Oral tradition has heavily supported this theory. Prominent Esan and Edo historians have collected stories about this migration. During this migration it was said that three brothers, Ojie-Ekpende, Udah, and Ojieosan, left Benin and moved towards the north side called Ukukuruku. Udah stayed at Ekunma (Ekpoma), and told his brothers and their followers to move further. He told them that Ojie- Ekpende is stronger than Ojiesan, and ordered that the weaker should stay closer to him while the stronger should move further with his men (meaning Ojie-Ekpend should move further). Among them was Okolo, the father Ojie-Amen. However, Okolo could not get to Idoa land. Among Ojie-Ekpende's companions was his wife, Urabi. They settled in this land but later discovered that a group of people were already living there. With Edo people all over the Edo Region he was respected by his group and those he met. Ojie-Ekpende's people were Ojie-Amen, Oghodor, and Okokhun. These men had wives except Ojie-Amen, who lost his father on their way to Odoa. Some months later Ijiekhea, also from Edo, traced his friend Ojie-Ekpende to the land of Odoa. Ojie-Ekpende gave birth to four sons and a daughter by names: Ebe-Ehirakha-Okogimen, Enabohifor, Okpikhor, and Ailmonka while the daughter was named Udumen. Some say that the warrior by name Ijie-Akhea founded Atuogwa and Ofie, though some said that he came with a brother, Ofie. Festivals in Idoa community In all of Esan land, festivals are carried out periodically, which is a means of social interaction and promoting unity among the people. Iluoror Festival, which is held in February every year, is also called the New Yam Festival. The festival is as old as the existence of the community. It is held to mark the beginning of the planting season, to appreciate the gods for the success of the last year's planting season, and to appease the gods for strength for the next planting season in ancient times. The first meal is ihihea and eaten either with water or yams, after which every household pounds yam and slaughters animals like goats, rams, and cows depending on their financial position. From there, everyone goes to the palace for display of traditional dance according to their groups. Ilukpe festival The Ilukpe festival is held annual hi June, and it is a thanksgiving festival. In this festival, sons and daughters offer thanksgiving to their late fathers and it is normally done on eke (ize) market day. Every first son of the family slaughters a goat and a woman slaughters a hen. In a polygamous house, the first son of the late man has to slaughter the goat and send the right leg that contains the tail to the most senior living uncle, while his or her junior siblings will do the same to him. All of the meat will be used for cooking. Ihaelen Otu (age group naming ceremony) The Ihaelen Otu Festival is a festival done to name age groups in the Idoa Community. This ceremony is done when the community deems it necessary. The ceremony is carried out to give names to youths that have come of age. It is considered an initiation into adulthood. Once named, these youths (now classified as adults) are entitled to the same rights as all other adults.

It is noted for its use of biblical ingredients and the use of wild plants and roots foraged from the nearby hillsides, and for preparing traditional and innovative Levantine, Arab, and Jewish cuisine. History The Eucalyptus was founded by Moshe Basson, a native of Iraq who moved to Israel with his family as a refugee when he was an infant. Basson's parents owned a bakery in Jerusalem's Beit Safafa neighborhood, and cultivated a vegetable garden and raised chickens to supplement their government food rations. In the early 1960s Moshe planted a eucalyptus seedling in the garden. Twenty-five years later his brother Ya'acov built a restaurant around the tree, with the bole standing in the middle of the dining room and the branches extending above the roof. He brought in Moshe as the cook, and Moshe soon took over the place. Like the bakery Basson's father had owned, the restaurant initially catered to working people. The tables were covered with red-checked oilcloth that could be wiped clean rather than laundered. When Basson started flavoring his cooking with wild edible roots and plants that he gathered in the surrounding fields, the restaurant began attracting a foodie crowd. Basson closed the restaurant when he heard that the city was planning to redevelop the site into a shopping center, and traveled abroad to sample the cuisines of Cyprus, Turkey, Thailand, and Africa. According to The Jerusalem Post, The Eucalyptus was \\"an underground Jerusalem institution [that] has long been a place of pilgrimage for visiting food writers and other enthusiasts of the gastronomic experience\\", and when it closed, \\"there was mourning in the culinary community\\". Upon his return, Basson reopened The Eucalyptus in a new location at 7 Hyrcanus Street in downtown Jerusalem, which was part of a growing Israeli food scene. Four years later, he moved the eatery to an address in Safra Square. He made the restaurant kosher in 1997 after his father's death. He was forced to close the restaurant again during the Second Intifada in 2002 due to a drop-off in tourism, but reopened in 2008 back on Hyrcanus Street. As of 2015, the restaurant is located in Hutzot Hayotzer opposite the Walls of Jerusalem. After training in Peru with chef Gast√≥n Acurio, Basson's son began to work with him at The Eucalyptus. Cuisine The Eucalyptus promotes the Israeli food trend emphasizing biblical ingredients, including the Seven Species. \\"Wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olive oil, and date honey\\" are all regularly used in dishes. Basson has extensively researched biblical food preparation and eating traditions as well. In addition, Basson personally forages for wild ingredients growing on the nearby Jerusalem hills, including wild chicory, mallow, sage, purslane, lemon verbena, and other edible plants. Instead of stuffed grape leaves, for example, the restaurant offers stuffed Jerusalem sage, mulberry leaves, cyclamen leaves, and mallow. Basson serves maqluba The menu is primarily meat-based, although some vegetarian and vegan dishes are available. Tasting menus are available for different courses, such as a soup course of Jerusalem artichoke, lentil, and tomato and mint soups and a meze course of pickled green almonds, marinated black olives, and hummus and eggplant salad. Basson makes a ceremony with diner participation out of his signature dish, maqluba, a regional dish prepared by browning chicken in the bottom of a heavy pot, layering browned vegetables and rice into the pot, slow-cooking the dish without stirring it, and finally flipping it out upside down to produce a cake-shaped mound with layers of rice and vegetables topped by the chicken. Other house specialties are figs stuffed with chicken and served in a sweet and sour tamarind sauce, and neck of lamb baked overnight in a clay pot covered with pita bread. The restaurant has hosted several multi- course dinners featuring animals and birds whose kashrut status is not widely known. These include an 18-course meal in 2010 that featured pheasant and guineafowl pastries, water buffalo, swordfish, deer, and fried locust, and a 16-course \\"Feast of Exotic Curiosities\\" sponsored by the Biblical Museum of Natural History, including Asian water buffalo, kingklip fish, and Muscovy duck. When a plague of locusts swarmed into southern Israel in 2013, Basson served the kosher species of locust to customers at private dining events. Cafe Esperanza In 2013 Basson opened a 100-seat kosher dairy cafe over the restaurant. Named after Basson's mother and daughter, Cafe Esperanza's menu draws on Italian and Levantine influences. Customers can select their salad ingredients from planters lining the balcony.

In past centuries it has also been called Midleton School. Although founded in 1696, the school did not open until 1717. It went through a period of inactivity early in the 19th century, and by the 1860s had low numbers, but was reinvigorated by a new Principal and by the end of the 1870s was one of Ireland's leading schools. Originally for boys only, it is now co-educational. The school has a strong Church of Ireland tradition, and its chaplain is also priest-in-charge of the neighbouring Youghal Union of parishes.New partnership between Midleton College and the Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross is inaugurated dated 22 October 2018 at ireland.anglican.org Origins The college was founded in 1696 by Elizabeth Hamilton, Countess of Orkney, as a grammar school for boys, but was not opened until 1717.history at midletoncollege.ie, accessed 21 April 2019 Its origin came about when King William III was seeking to pension off his favourite, and former mistress, Elizabeth Villiers, granting her more than 95,000 acres of land in Ireland which had been the personal estates of King James II and later of William III's late wife, Queen Mary II. In November 1695, Elizabeth Villiers married Lord George Hamilton, who a few weeks later was created Earl of Orkney, but before marrying she put her Irish estates into a trust controlled by her brother Lord Villiers and Thomas Brodrick of Midleton, the son and heir of Sir St John Brodrick, who in 1653 had been granted the lands of Corabbey, renamed as Midleton by a charter of 1670.Midleton College, a school from scandal dated 27 September 2017 at midletonwith1d.wordpress.com With part of her new riches, Lady Orkney decided to found a school,Brendan Lehane, The Companion Guide to Ireland (Companion Guides, 2001), p. 230 offering to give land in County Cork to trustees \\"to build a free school and pay the master a salary of ¬£100\\".Parliamentary Papers: 1850-1908, Vol. 22, Part 1 (Great Britain Parliament, House of Commons, 1858), p. 114 In October 1696, her trustees Villiers and Brodrick conveyed some 1,882 acres in the baronies of Kinnelea and East and West Carbery to two further trustees, Brodrick's brother Alan Brodrick of Midleton and his brother-in-law Laurence Clayton of Mallow. Unfortunately for Lady Orkney, in 1700 the Parliament of England used an Act of Resumption to take back most of her Irish estates, but not the land she had used to endow the school, a gift which was specifically confirmed by another Act of Parliament in 1702. However, Brodrick still did not get on with building a school, claiming that he did not have enough funds in the trust and that time was needed \\"to accumulate out of the rents and profits a sufficient sum to build a School House\\". In 1710, the trustees granted leases of the school's land which later proved controversial. History Lady Orkney, founder of the school Alan Brodrick, the trustee who managed the opening of the school, who was created Viscount Midleton in 1717 Charles Robert Barry, a distinguished old boy pictured in Vanity Fair, 1889 Trevor West, an old boy who wrote a history of the school The school finally opened in 1717, in a new purpose-built limestone schoolhouse which is still in use, with the Rev. George Chinnery, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, appointed as the first Master in August 1717. Chinnery was followed in 1750 by his son, and between them the two men ran the school successfully until 1775. The most notable old boy of the Chinnery years was John Philpot Curran (1750‚Äì1817), a famous orator and wit who became Master of the Rolls in Ireland. However, after 1775 the school's fortunes suffered. Between 1804 and 1830, all teaching came to an end, with a new Master still drawing his salary but living in Dublin. According to a committee report published in 1872 In 1829, the Commissioners of Education repaired the school's main building, and in 1830 a new Master was appointed and the College was re-opened. Among the new intake of boys were Michael Roberts (1817‚Äì1882), later a notable mathematician, and his twin brother, William. However, the renewal did not last long. In 1863, the school had only one boarder and three day boys, and a new Principal was appointed, the Rev. Thomas Moore. A man of great energy, within a year Moore had increased the numbers to forty boarders and twenty-two day boys, and in 1864 the Commissioners of Education granted the funding for a new three-storey red- brick School House, providing classrooms, a dormitory, rooms for schoolmasters, and a bathroom, which was completed in 1865.Nigel Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer (London: A. & C. Black, 2006), pp. 17‚Äì18 As an Anglican institution, the school's fortunes might have suffered from the rise of Irish nationalism, and it also had new competition in the shape of the Midleton Christian Brothers Secondary School, opened in 1867, but nevertheless it continued to grow, and in 1878 there were sixty boarders and fifty-one day boys. Moore was by now employing three other schoolmasters, including the young Standish James O'Grady, as well as a housemaster to accommodate extra boarders, and the school joined the top flight of Irish schools, gaining scholarships at Dublin, Oxford, and Cambridge. It was a founding member of the Irish Rugby Football Union, being listed as a member in the first year of the IRFU, 1879.Richard M. Peter, The Origins and Development of Football in Ireland (Ulster Historical Foundation, reprint, 1999), p. 69 In 1880, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland appointed commissioners \\"to Inquire Into the Endowments, Funds, and Actual Condition\\" of all endowed schools in Ireland, and in a report in 1881 they commented The college became co- educational by first admitting girls in the 1970s.

Andes Mountains in Peru Geological history, stratigraphy & tectonics The oldest rocks in Peru date to the Precambrian and are more than two billion years old. Along the southern coast, granulite and charnockite shows reworking by an ancient orogeny mountain building event. Situated close to the Peru-Chile Trench, these rocks have anomalously high strontium isotope ratios, which suggest recent calc-alkaline volcanism. In the Eastern Cordillera of Peru, Precambrian magmatism in the Huanaco region produced ultramafic, mafic and felsic rocks, including serpentinite, meta-diorite, meta-gabbro, meta-tonalite and diorite and granite that intruded after the first phase of orogenic tectonic activity. The Grenville orogeny had a major impact in Peru. The basement of the Central Andean orogeny includes the rocks of the Arequipa Massif, which reach granulite grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies and formed around 1.9 billion years ago. Zircon grains in these rocks match those in Labrador, Greenland and Scotland, indicating that much of western South America originated as a promontory of the proto-North American continent Laurentia. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= In the Paleozoic, Peru was on the western margin of the supercontinent Gondwana. Analysis of Ordovician and Devonian sandstones in the Eastern Cordillera (spanning into Bolivia) indicates eroded zircon grains formed to the east in Brazil during the Brasiliano orogeny. By contrast, Altiplano and Coastal Cordillera sandstones seem to have originated from the Arequipa Massif. Plutonic and volcanic rocks in the Inner Arc domain (later uplifted in the Central Andean orogeny) include the high-grade, low-pressure metamorphic gabbro-granite of the San Gaban Complex and early Permian Mitu Group alkali basalts. Rocks, such as those in the Mitu Group, formed during pulses of magmatism in back-arc basins. Parts of central North America were adjacent to western South America during the late Paleozoic, helping to drive folding and metamorphism. The region was affected by the Hercynian orogeny from 550 to 220 million years ago, leading to granitoid intrusion, nepheline syenite, syntectonic granites and calc-alkaline volcanism. Along the coast, subduction produced basins on land and volcanic activity, that resulted in the two kilometer thick Yamayo Group and the overlying one to six kilometer volcanic and volcaniclastic Yura Group. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= The Andean orogeny began in the late Triassic. In the south, the two kilometer Chocolate Formation formed with sedimentary rocks into the late Triassic. Central Peru experienced less magmatic activity than during the Hercynian orogeny, but acid plutonic rocks emplaced in the center of the country. The Pucara Basin subsided on the landward side of a structural high from the Triassic into the early Jurassic. The basin filled first with carbonates and then with argillite followed by shallow water carbonates. Some carbonates were later transformed to dolomite and the basin's rocks show signs of Mississippi Valley Type lead-zinc mineralization, common in basin-forming shear zones. In the area of Puno-Santa Lucia, which was slowly being uplifted as the Andes, two kilometer Paleozoic Cabanillas Group quartzite and shale is overlain by the 1.5 kilometer Jurassic Lagunillas Group. The Huancane and Moho groups include red beds and limestone, formed in closed basin. The 1600 kilometer Coastal Batholith of Peru formed in an ensialic marginal basin in the early Cretaceous, with the emplacement of pillow lavas, gabbro and volcaniclastic rocks. In the north, it formed as new continental crust with no older continental crust beneath it, while to the south it spans thick Precambrian rocks. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago- present)= As the Andean orogeny accelerated from the Albian, rock deformation shifted toward the Amazonian foredeep. The Mara√±√≥n fold and thrust belt formed in the Eocene, bounding the Western Cordillera. Crustal shortening produced a sialic root to the Andes. Marine transgressions swept the region starting in the Eocene, emplacing conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and diatomite in the Sechura Basin and Pisco Basin‚Äîa pair of forearc basins in the north. The Miocene-aged Cordillera Blanca Batholith intrudes the Coastal Batholith over 50 kilometer thick crust, with S-type peraluminous granites produced by deformation and uplift. The majority of rocks in the batholith are high-sodium, high-silica I-type granites, with characteristics that have been interpreted as subducted oceanic crust melts. However, it does not have positioning consistent with subduction and geologists have interpreted it as underplating leading to partial melting, the formation of trondhjemitic magmas rich in clinopyroxene, garnet and amphibole. Intense volcanism, deformation and plutonism was common in the Miocene and Pliocene in central Peru. In the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary, andesite lavas erupted, forming the Arequipa and Barosso groups in the south, including partially melted Precambrian granulite gneiss, with a high lead concentration.

Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics The Cocos and Nazca plates formed in the Miocene. The Panama Microplate is made of oceanic crust basalt, similar to the basalt plateau at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea. The isthmus of Panama formed due to convergent tectonics of the eastern Pacific subduction zone, which created a magmatic arc extending from southern North America. The center of the isthmus, from Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica to El Valle volcano in Panama was uplifted during the subduction of the unusually thick Cocos Ridge oceanic crust, which also produced the four kilometer high Talamanca Range. The western edge of the Caribbean Plate‚Äîthe Central American Volcanic Arc‚Äîalso collided in the Neogene and was compressed as the South American Plate moved northward. The El Valle volcano is the easternmost stratovolcano in Central America. Dacite and andesite flows from five to 10 million years ago are the oldest rocks, followed by a period of quiet 3.4 million years ago and newer dacite domes and pyroclastic flows between 900,000 and 200,000 years ago. The volcano was the result of crust subduction. The combination of these forces produced the Isthmus of Panama and resulted in different sea surface salinity between the Pacific and Atlantic since 4.2 million years ago. It also resulted in massive interchange of species between North and South America and brought global changes in climate and ocean circulation. The Bocas del Toro Archipelago on the western Caribbean coast records local stratigraphy through this period, with Pliocene to Pleistocene coral reef carbonates overlying Miocene basalt and siliclastic shale. In the remote southeastern Dari√©n Province, crystalline basement rock of the San Blas Complex forms massifs in the northeast and southwest, dating to the Cretaceous, Paleocene and Eocene. These rocks and others in the north such as rhyolite, dacite, basaltic andesite, granodiorite and quartz diorite indicate that the region was a separate magmatic arc until 20 million years ago. In the south, pre-collision basement rocks include radiolarian chert, pillow basalt and diabase. Complex faulting and folding formed the Chucunaque-Tuira Basin includes three kilometers of sediments from the Miocene deposited during the collision with South America. Offshore of Colombia and western Panama, the Panama Basin formed between 27 and eight million years ago due to asymmetric seafloor spreading between the Nazca and Cocos plates. The Mapelo rift and the Yaquina graben in the eastern basin are remnants of old and now inactive spreading centers. Between 22 and 20 million years ago, hotspot volcanism generated the Carnegie, Cocos and Malpelo ridges.

The attacker, who can not be named in the British media due to his age, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to three years' incarceration in a Young Offender Institution. The attack happened two months after the Brexit referendum and figures in media and politics alleged that the attack was fuelled by xenophobia, which was not found to be the case in a court of law. Some commentators suggested that compared to their interest in the crime when it happened, the media took less interest in the verdict of the trial. Attack The attack took place at 11:30 pm at The Stow, a shopping precinct in Harlow. J√≥≈∫wik had two friends accompanying him and had been drinking vodka. The prosecution said that unprovoked, the defendant moved around behind J√≥≈∫wik to punch him. The defence said that according to prosecution witnesses J√≥≈∫wik and his friends were much older and larger than the defendant and his friends, and made racist remarks then \\"invited violence\\" from the youths. The judge accepted that the youth did not intend to kill J√≥≈∫wik, and that J√≥≈∫wik was intoxicated and had approached the youth. Reaction The Polish government sent two police officers to Harlow in the aftermath of the attack. EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said \\"We Europeans can never accept, never, Polish workers being harassed, beaten up or even murdered in the streets of Essex\\". Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow, considered Juncker's words to be unreflective of the town: \\"The vast majority of people are horrified as to the tragedies that have occurred. Harlow residents and the Polish community have rallied together. So what he has said, rather than help the situation has made things much worse\\". Initial reports in August 2016 alleged that J√≥≈∫wik was killed for speaking Polish. James O'Brien, an LBC radio host, said that UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage was responsible for J√≥≈∫wik's death, saying \\"Does a politician like Farage talking about people speaking foreign on a train know that this leads inexorably to young people thinking they have the right to object to people speaking foreign in public?\\". Separately, the BBC interviewed a friend of J√≥≈∫wik, who said that Farage had \\"blood on his hands\\". After the trial concluded, Farage said that this interview had been damaging to him and his family. The BBC said that it aired interviews suggesting several motives, including anti-social behaviour. In an article about another crime in April 2017, The New York Times brought up the death of J√≥≈∫wik and said he was \\"repeatedly pummeled and kicked by a group of boys and girls\\". Harlow-born journalist Jason Cowley wrote that this was inaccurate for several reasons: the group of youths was all male, only one was charged, and he threw only one punch. There was considerably less media interest in the verdict of the trial, which found that there was no xenophobic motive to the attack on J√≥≈∫wik. Brendan O'Neill wrote in The Sunday Times that after J√≥≈∫wik died \\"the media couldn't get enough of this terrible incident. The commentary was ceaseless. The killing trended. But they‚Äôve forgotten it [after the verdict]. And the reason they‚Äôve forgotten it, the reason Jozwik‚Äôs name has been all but erased from commentary circles, is pretty awful\\". Legal proceedings Six youths were arrested, and all but one were released because of insufficient evidence. He was charged with manslaughter and his trial began at Chelmsford Youth Court in January 2017. He was found guilty of the manslaughter of J√≥≈∫wik and was sentenced to three years in a Young Offender Institution. He was on bail at the time of the attack and had two prior convictions, for possession of a knuckle duster and for threatening behaviour.

It was the only game in development by Hyper Image. Assuming the role of a newcomer pilot from the titular squadron assigned to fight against an rival organization only known as The Collective in a foreign planet, players take control of a windowless VTV hovertank craft called Hunter in order to complete a series of missions and tasks, while battling against enemy VTV hovertanks. Hyper Image was originally working on a top-down shooter for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, before the team later moved to the Jaguar with Phase Zero and opted to use their own interpretation of the heightmap technique to render the landscapes and visuals, in addition of also placing emphasis on LAN play for multiplayer. Though the team at Hyper Image kept working on Phase Zero, despite not receiving anymore payment for its development in mid-1995, Atari Corp. ultimately halted and terminated the project in March 1996 along with other upcoming titles for the platform, a month before Atari merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on April of the same year. Although unreleased, a playable prototype has since been released and sold online by independent groups such as B&C; Computervisions and later Songbird Productions.  Gameplay  HUD showcases multiple gameplay elements such as the player's shield, radar, reticle, speedometer and currently selected weapon. Phase Zero is a shooter video game with action and strategy elements that is primarily played in a first-person perspective, similar to AirCars and Hover Strike, where players assume the role of a rookie pilot from the titular squadron taking control of the VTV Hunter hovertank craft on a variety of missions across several levels, such as retrieval of a lost member from the same squadron or the elimination of enemy targets. Before the start of any level, players can browse through the main menu and check the different options available such as looking at the mission briefing to learn about the main objective to complete in the current mission. Though the single-player missions can be played normally and some of the options in the main menu operate without issues, options such as the network mode crashes the game, while others like saving the game manually on the cartridge's EEPROM do not work in the unfinished release, in addition of the gameplay being prone to glitches and game-crashing bugs. The game also features support for the ProController. Players are given full control of their craft in a three- dimensional environment during gameplay, with battles taking place in real- time and featuring destructible environments. Though players could freely roam in the game's levels to find new weapons and other items, the main objective or objectives of the missions have to be completed in order to progress further. Depending on the current mission, players are given a set number of weapons that can be chosen by pressing Option and right on the controller to attack enemy crafts but once the selected weapon is depleted, it becomes unavailable unless the player finds more ammo in the level. Pressing Option and up will bring the map screen, which shows both enemies and the location of the main objective within the current level, but since the action takes place in real-time, enemies can inflict damage to the player's craft. If the player's current Hunter unit is destroyed, they are immediately ejected and evacuated from the area, forcing to restart the mission. Due to its unfinished nature, players are only able to reach the fifth mission that cannot be fully completed due to a missing objective element to progress further into the game, however, more levels can be accessed via cheat code.  History  Phase Zero was first displayed to the public at Atari Corporation's booth during the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in 1995 under the name Hover Hunter, where both attendees and the video game press covering the event immediately compared the game with NovaLogic's Comanche and its Voxel Space engine due to the voxel-like graphics, and it only featured both an \\"Adventure\\" and \\"Combat\\" game modes to play for the audience, with the latter featuring support for up to eight consoles networked for multiplayer. In a January 1995 article featured on the student publication The Diamondback, it revealed that Hyper Image Productions was a game development company formed by seven former college students who took the path of entering into the video game industry. Paul Good, then-executive of Hyper Image stated that although they were not happy with the state of Hover Hunter when showcased at Winter CES 1995, it received positive reception from the public, while also looking for a publisher to buy the rights to the project. The article also revealed that the technique used to render the in-game visuals, dubbed \\"Displacement Texture Mapping\\", was written by both Jeremy Gordon (head of the company) and Otavio Good (brother of Paul Good), allowing them to create landscapes from pixels. In two March 1995 online interviews by both Atari Explorer Online and Game Zero Magazine respectively with Hyper Image, the team spoke further about their beginnings, revealing that Andy Carlson was the composer for Hover Hunter and Jeremy divulged information in regards to the technique that he and Otavio were using to display the visuals of the game, which turned out to be their own interpretation of heightmap technique that was found in titles such as Cyberdreams' 1993 racing game CyberRace. Though the team remarked that Hover Hunter was Hyper Image's first full-fledged title for the Jaguar, they stated that a small networkable Pong game was their first project developed for the system. Jeremy also stated that the reason as to why they chose the Jaguar to develop their title was due to its powerful technical capabilities compared with other systems released at the time and the open support from Atari Corp. themselves. The game made its second and last trade show appearance at E3 1995, featuring a different set of playfields and HUD display compared to the last build seen at WCES 1995. In a post-E3 1995 interview by Atari Explorer Online with the team at Hyper Image, they spoke more in regards to their beginnings as a game development company and the title in question, with both Jeremy and Paul stating that the team was originally working on an overhead shooter on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System but they later moved to the Jaguar and opted to use heightfield instead for their next project, with Jeremy comparing it to F-Zero but \\"with heights\\", while Paul explained further that each pixel on the landscape had its own elevation value to represent a specific height from a flat terrain. However, they later found out that the terrain would get heavily pixelated when being too close to it, but Otavio managed to implement interpolated heightfields to the technique that he and Jeremy created for the Jaguar to mitigate the issue. The team also placed importance to the LAN play for multiplayer, as members of the company were fans of networking titles. The game began to be advertised in magazines between mid-1995 and late 1995, while being slated for a Q2 1995 release, but it was later slated for a September/Q3 1995 release. Internal documents from Atari revealed that the game was renamed from Hover Hunter to Phase Zero on August 1995. Although other internal documents from Atari still listed the project as in development on December of the same year, in addition of kept being advertised in magazines and showcased during the Fun 'n' Games Day event hosted by Atari, Hyper Image stopped receiving payment from Atari for the development of Phase Zero in the middle of 1995. On March 1996, a month before merging with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on April of the same year, Atari Corporation halted and cancelled all of their upcoming projects for the Jaguar platform, including Phase Zero. In the same year after it was cancelled, the trademark for its original name was abandoned, while the trademark renewals for the name of the development company were also cancelled in 2003 and 2004 respectively.  Release  When Hasbro Interactive released the patents and rights to the Jaguar into public domain in 1999 by declaring it as an open platform and opening the doors for homebrew development, it permitted independent publisher and developers to release unfinished titles from the system's past life cycle as a result. A playable but incomplete build of Phase Zero was leaked online by former Atari Explorer Online editor Mark Santora on June 24, 2000, and this same version of the unfinished title would be later published by B&C; Computervisions as a cartridge-only release on June 5, 2002 under the title Phase Zero Demo, to denote that it is not the finished product. Songbird Productions, an independent developer and publisher who specializes in unreleased titles for both the Jaguar and Atari Lynx, obtained permission from the original authors of the project to publish and sell the title under their label, with hopes of recovering the game's source code in order to complete it. In a 2018 forum post at AtariAge, former Hyper Image programmer Jamie Bible stated that a version of the game was also in development for the Sega Saturn, but it was cancelled as well.

Unlike the synthesis of 5- and 6-membered rings, the preparation of larger rings competes unfavorably with polymerization reactions. Polymers arise from coupling of long chain precursors. Such reactions are disfavored when the acyclic compounds are dilute. Although high dilution reactions can be conducted in a batch reactor with large volumes of solvent, a more practical implementation entails slow addition of reactants, under conditions that the reactants are more rapidly consumed than the rate of addition. Typically, additions use one or more syringe pumps.

His lyric poetry combines religious and folk tradition, modernist American literary practice, and Canadian landscape and atmosphere. Biography J. I. Segal was born Yaakov Yitzchak Skolar in 1896 in Slobkovitz, Podolia in the Russian Empire (now Solobkovtsy, Ukraine), the second youngest of seven children. He moved to the village of Koritz with his family at the age of three, after the death of his father. Segal immigrated to Montreal in 1911. Upon arriving in Canada, he found work as a tailor in the garment industry, and then later as a teacher at the Jewish People's School. By 1915 he had begun submitting poetry to the Keneder Adler. In 1918 he published his first collection of poetry, Fun Mayn Velt (\\"From My World\\"), which brought him immediate recognition, not only in Canada but in New York City and Poland. In 1923, Segal and his family relocated to New York, where he joined Di Yunge poet Mani Leib's shoemaker collective. After publishing two collections of poetry, Segal returned to Montreal in 1928 after the death of his young daughter, Tsharna, whom he often addresses in later poems. From 1941 until his death he was co-editor of the literary pages of the Keneder Adler along with Melech Ravitch.

Team Taisan has also participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, winning their class on their debut in . For nearly their entire career, Taisan has been sponsored by tire manufacturer Yokohama Rubber Company, often carrying the name of Yokohama's Advan brand. History The Team Taisan Endless Porsche which won the 2012 GT300 Drivers and Teams Championships The team was initially formed through and their efforts in the All Japan Endurance Championship and Fuji Long Distance Series. Taisan operated one of the teams' Porsche 962C with drivers Kunimitsu Takahashi and Kenji Takahashi. Kunimitsu went on to win the Endurance Championship three times from 1985‚Äì1987, while Nova Engineering won the team championships in the Fuji Long Distance Series those same years. Taisan expanded their program to include the Japanese Touring Car Championship in 1989 with BMW M3s, adding Briton Will Hoy to the team in 1990. A Group A category Nissan Skyline GT-R was added to the team in 1991 for Kenji Takahashi and Keiichi Tsuchiya while their BMWs continued in the lower JTC-2 category. Kunimitsu replaced Kenji in the Skyline for 1992 and 1993 before Kunimitsu and Tsuchiya left to form their own racing team and the JTCC eliminated the Group A cars from the series, leaving the team with a single Super Touring BMW for Kazuo Mogi in 1994. Taisan returned to sports car racing in 1994 in the new All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship, the team participating with one of their former 962Cs and teamed alongside a Ferrari F40. Masahiko Kondo and Anthony Reid won one race for the Porsche while Tetsuya Ota and Oscar Larrauri earned one victory in the Ferrari. A switch to a pair of Porsche 911 GT2s earned three GT1 victories in 1995 and the teams championship for the GT1 category, while the team also added a GT2 class campaign under the Team Taisan Jr. moniker for a Porsche 964. Taisan Jr. became a dominant team in the rechristened GT300 class, winning the drivers and teams championships in 1996, followed by second place in 1997 and another championship in 1998 while campaigning a new Toyota MR2 in cooperation with Tsuchiya Engineering. Taisan's success led to the team being invited to participate in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in for the LMGT category. Their Porsche 911 GT3-R, driven by Hideo Fukuyama, Atsushi Yogo, and Bruno Lambert won the category by a six-lap margin. Upon returning to Japan, Taisan began a streak of four consecutive GT300 team championships from 2000‚Äì2003, including a drivers championship with Fukuyama in 2000. Another Le Mans also earned the team a podium finish in their class for . Taisan downsized to a single Porsche team from 2004 onward as the JGTC transitioned to the new Super GT Series; Taisan eventually joined with Endless for a joint program that earned them another drivers and teams championships in 2012. The team expanded once again in 2013, retaining the Porsche in Super GT while joining the new Asian Le Mans Series with a Ferrari 458 Italia GT2, winning the series championship and earning the team an automatic invitation to Le Mans, their first since . A difficult 2014 season with a new Nissan GT-R led Taisan to take a sabbatical year from Super GT, returning in 2016 with an Audi R8 LMS in cooperation with SARD. Team Taisan also began to embrace electric motorsport by participating in the All Japan EV-GP Series in 2011 with Tesla Roadsters as well as a modified Porsche 914, winning the 2011 championship. The team also began developing electric karts. In 2018 Chiba announced an auction of many former Taisan racing cars dating back to the early 1990s, including several JGTC and Super GT machines.

Originally only in the form of a print book delivered to all households for several decades, it now also exists online. Originally named the Melbourne Telephone Exchange Company, White Pages Australia was founded in 1880 as Australia's first telephone exchange. It later became known as the Victorian Telephone Exchange Company and remained a private company until 1887, when it was purchased by the Victorian Colonial Government. White Pages Australia is part of the Sensis brand, owned in part by Telstra and in part by Platinum Equity. As a part of Telstra's carrier licence conditions, the White Pages is required to produce an annual alphabetical public number directory. This public number directory is then made available free of charge to all of Telstra's customers and the customers of other carriage service providers. In recent decades, Sensis has received extensive public critique regarding the environmental impact of producing hard copy directories. It has been estimated that over 5 million trees are cut down each year in order to publish the hard copies of White Pages, however, as of 2016 only 2 to 3 percent of households in Australia had opted out of receiving hard copies.  History of the White Pages  1880 The private Melbourne Telephone Exchange Company opened Australia's first telephone exchange in August 1800. Federation and 1901 Each of the six Australian colonies had their own telephony communications network prior to the Federation of Australia in 1901. As part of Federation the Post Master General (later to become Australia Post) took ownership of the telephone network nationally. =1920s= By the 1920s the telephone had become a crucial form of communication in Australia. At this time the Post Master General's Office started selling advertising in the exchange directory and directory based advertising was born in Australia. =1970s= The Post Master General's Office regulated telecommunications and operated all the telephone and related communications within Australia from Federation up to 22nd of December 1975. In mid 1975 the department split into two Government business enterprises: The Australian Telecommunications Commission (trading as Telecom Australia) and the Australian Postal Commission (trading as Australia Post). 1975 also saw the birth of the National Directory Service (NDS). Telecom published the first version of a category based director in Australia called the Yellow Pages. =1980s= In 1980 the White Pages was separated from the Yellow Pages in Brisbane. This continued across Australia in the 1980s until the White Pages was completely separate from the Yellow Pages. The White Pages directory became so large that it was necessary to print multiple editions, splitting the alphabet in half. =1990s= In 1994 the world's first White Pages online site was published on the World Wide Web including daily updates to the business, government and residential directory. Just a year later the White Pages directory was also offered on CD- Rom. =2000s= In the new millennium the White Pages introduced online only listings, a 'business finder' feature and the ability to clone your White Pages listing content on to the Yellow Pages online website. An 'opt in' distribution model was introduced for the residential version of the White Pages in metro Melbourne and Sydney, allowing users to decide whether they wanted to receive the residential White Pages book to their home or not. The White Pages also trialled a CD 'book view' version of the directory in the 2000s, but it did not prove to be very popular. =2010 to now= A compact version of the White Pages was trialed in September 2010 in Sydney that was 85% of the standard directory size. This would be trialed in many areas but would eventually be rolled back. In 2011 the White Pages partnered with Vision Australia to release a White Pages Accessibility Guide to help provide a business, government and residential telephone directory to the vision impaired of Australia. In March 2014, Telstra sold 70% of the Sensis business to American private equity firm Platinum Equity for $454 million. As a part of the deal Sensis would continue producing and distributing the White Pages directory as required under Telstra's carrier licence. The sale saw Sensis depart Telstra management and begin to operate as a separate entity.

Argentina has one of the biggest economies in Latin America and is rich in natural resources, which could play a large part in its future economic development.  World Bank  The World Bank is an international financial organisation. Its primary purpose is to offer loans to countries for capital projects.  Argentina  Argentina is an affluent country, but it also has high levels of poverty. From 2004 to 2008, Argentina reduced poverty levels by promoting economic growth. Average income grew at a rate of 7.6%. The lowest 40% of incomes rose by 4.2% during this period. After 2008, income growth slowed down. In 2019 Argentina‚Äôs economic freedom score was 52.2, ranking 148th globally. Its overall score decreased by 0.1 points, with plunging scores for fiscal health and government spending, outweighing improvements in monetary freedom and property rights. Argentina ranked 26th among 32 countries in the Americas region, and its overall score remained below the regional and world average. Since the 2015 presidential election, Argentina's economic policies prioritized unification of the exchange rate, reaching an agreement with international creditors, modernizing import policies, reducing inflation and reforming the national statistics system. Experts claimed these reforms would lower external tariffs, increase GDP and increase trade. In April 2017, after a long period of financial distress, President Mauricio Macri declared that \\"Argentina is in the middle of a cultural change\\" and that \\"Argentina is back in the world. Argentina wants to play a significant role in the global scenario.\\" Argentina did increase its international trade. Argentina is a member of the G20. The country is looking into the OECD to become an observer in the Pacific Alliance. At the beginning of 2019, economic growth slowed, producing forecasts of a recession. In April 2018, the Argentine peso depreciated with its value decreasing by 50% against the dollar. This caused inflation to skyrocket in June. Notwithstanding an ongoing crisis of confidence in the economy, President Macri is sticking with his government‚Äôs politically risky austerity plan of budget cuts and tax increases to close the fiscal gap.  History  The World Bank has helped Argentina on multiple occasions. It offered new loans after the economic downturn of 2017. Argentina became a member country of the world Bank group in 1956, 10 years after the inception of the banking group. The country's first projects began 5 years later in 1961, focusing primarily on infrastructure development projects. Between 1961 and 1979, all projects funded by the World Bank to Argentina focused on developing the nation's roads, highways, and agricultural production. In the 1980s, the World Bank began to diversify its projects in Argentina, funding industrial credit program, coal and oil refineries, banking loans and public sector development credits. In the 1990s, the World Bank expanded its global mission to include programs aimed at good governance (which it measures with six indicators). It asserted that governance is \\"the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development\\". In 1983, Argentina underwent a regime change from a military dictatorship to a democracy after the election of Raul Alfonsin, and experienced issues with corruption and mismanagement throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The World Bank expanded projects in Argentina over the 1990s to include judicial reform, tax reform, and general public sector reform in efforts to improve Argentina's good governance indicators. World Bank Logo In 2017, the President of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim met with Argentinian officials in Buenos Aires. During his visit, Kim made a public speech focused on trade opportunities, knowledge sharing and cutting edge technology. Kim announced that the World Bank's two billion dollar investment in Argentina would be in sectors such as renewable energy, human development, agriculture, infrastructure, and in poverty reduction. The World Bank announced in November 2018 that the first 500 million dollars of the investment would target the overall finances of Argentina. Another $450 million would go to the Children and Youth Protection Program. According to the agreement, the 32.5 year work period would be extended an additional 7.5 years if the projects do not achieve results. As of 2019, The World Bank group has committed US$ 7.7 billion to 26 active projects. The World Bank states that its investment goals in Argentina are developing health, environment, education, infrastructure, labor market and social protection. Beginning in the 1980s, Argentina has been one of the largest recipients of World Bank financial support, generally falling in the top 10 credit receiving countries.  International Finance Corporation  The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is an organization within the World Bank that specializes in investment, advisory, and asset management services and aims to promote private-sector development in developing countries. Since 2000 the IFC has partnered with the Pan American Energy group, the second largest gas and oil organization in Argentina. IFC provided a $55 million loan to Banco Industrial in Argentina to give more to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Located in Buenos Aires Banco Industrial is a private bank that focuses on short-term and well-coordinated financial products. IFC promotes the idea that smaller businesses will create jobs and drive financial growth. SMEs are one mode of Argentina economic development, which Banco Industrial has focused on as a basis for digital banking.

The establishment of the Silver Queen and the later Magma mines was the main factor of the founding if the town. Superior is located approximately east of Phoenix and the same distance north of Tucson. Within the boundaries of Superior are what remains of Pinal City a former mining town. Brief history Apache Leap MountainWilliam Boyce Thompson Among the earliest inhabitants of the area in which Superior is located were the Native Americans of the Apache Tribe, Pascua Yaqui Tribe and the Tohono O'odham Nation. During the 1870s, at the height of the American Indian Wars, a company of Apache horsemen were ambushed by the US cavalry. After losing 50 men; the Apache retreated up a mountain located within the boundaries of what in the future would become Superior. Accepting defeat; the remaining 75 Apache Warriors leaped to their death rather than being captured by the US Army and therefore the mountain became known as the Apache Leap Mountain.Arizona Commerce Authority It wasn't long before the first prospectors in search of gold arrived. Prospector Charles Mason staked the first claims in 1875. In 1880, the Silver Queen Mining Company was organized and in 1882 the town of Hastings was founded and platted in 1900. Owners of a successful silver mine named their mine \\"Lake Superior\\". These stockholders were originally from Michigan. The \\"Lake Superior Mine\\" was the main contributor to the area's economy and therefore in 1902, the community changed the name of Hastings to Superior after the mine. William Boyce Thompson bought the old Silver Queen Mine in 1910, and by 1912, the new Magma Copper Company was in production running the operations of the Silver Queen Mine. The Magma Copper Company became one Arizona's greatest copper producer after the silver vein of the Queen Silver Mine dried and ran out. One of the outcomes World War I and World War II was the increased demand of copper and as such the town flourished. However, by the 1980s the main mining operations were moved to the nearby town of Miami. The Magma Copper Company's smelter, with the exception of the historic smelter stack, was demolished. In December 2017, the Resolution Copper Project began to mine in the land where the old Magma Copper Company was once located. The Resolution Copper Project is a joint venture between Rio Tinto of London and BHP-Billiton of Australia.

Pinal City Celia Ann ‚ÄúMattie‚Äù Blaylock Earp Silver was discovered about 1 mile west of Kings Crown Peak in the fall of 1874 and initially worked until March 24, 1875. The mine which became known as the Silver King Mine was located about 3 miles north of Superior.[ https://www.mindat.org/loc-6080.html Silver King Mine] A direct result of this discovery was the establishment in 1878, of Pinal City which quickly became a \\"Boom Town\\" of about two thousand residents. General George Stoneman established a military post by the base of the mountain close to Pinal City to protect the residents and the workers of the Silver King Mine from the Apaches. The post was named Picket Post and thus, the mountain in question became known as the Picket Post Mountain. The ores were initially crushed on- site by a Blake crusher and then transported by wagon trains whose ore carts were pulled by many mules to Pinal City.Superior, Arizona: An Old Mining Camp with Many Lives, By: David F. Briggs The tracks made by the wagon trains on the soft volcanic trail are still visible. The Pinal Cemetery was established in 1878. Among those who are buried there are the following:Pinal Cemetery Graves *Celia Ann ‚ÄúMattie‚Äù Blaylock Earp (1850-1888) - Mattie was Wyatt Earp's common law wife. Wyatt abandoned her and she ended up living in Pinal City. However, she was unable to make a living and on July 3, 1888, she took a lethal dose of laudanum and alcohol. Her death was ruled as \\"suicide by opium poisoning\\". *Manuelita Guzman (1844 - 1916) - Guzman was the matriarch of the Guzman family who have spanned over six generations in Superior. *Annie Maria Weston (September 4, 1881) - She was the wife of J. E. Weston. When the mine dried out, the economic situation in Pinal City worsened. The post office was closed on November 28, 1891 and the cemetery in 1892. The town was deserted shortly thereafter and is now considered a ghost town.

It was part of the Hundred Years' War. The campaign began on 12 July 1346, with the landing of English troops in Normandy, and ended with the capitulation of Calais on 3August 1347. The English army was led by King Edward III, and the French by King Philip VI. Edward was under pressure from the English Parliament to end the war either by negotiation or with a victory. As his forces gathered, Edward vacillated as to where in France he would land. Eventually he decided to sail for Gascony, to succour the Duke of Lancaster, who was facing the much larger main French army. Hampered by contrary winds, Edward instead made a surprise landing on the nearest part of France, the northern Cotentin Peninsula. The English devastated much of Normandy, and stormed and sacked Caen, slaughtering the population. They then raided the suburbs of Rouen before cutting a swath along the left bank of the Seine to Poissy, 20 miles from Paris. Turning north, the English became trapped in territory which the French had denuded of food. They escaped by fighting their way across a ford in the Somme river against a French blocking force. Two days later, on ground of their choosing, the English inflicted a heavy defeat on the French at the Battle of Cr√©cy on 26 August 1346, before moving on to besiege Calais. After an eleven-month siege, which stretched both countries' financial and military resources to the limit, the town fell. Shortly afterwards, the Truce of Calais was agreed; it ran for nine months to 7July 1348, but was extended repeatedly over the years until it was formally set aside in 1355. Fighting continued during the truce, but not on the same scale as during the Chevauch√©e. Calais served as an English entrep√¥t into northern France that was held for over two hundred years. Background alt=A Medieval image of Philip VI seated, wearing a blue robe Since the Norman Conquest of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them vassals of the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose. Over the centuries, English holdings in France had varied in size, but by 1337 only Gascony in south western France and Ponthieu in northern France were left. The Gascons preferred their relationship with a distant English king who left them alone to one with a French king who would interfere in their affairs. Following a series of disagreements between Philip VI of France () and Edward III of England (), on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council in Paris agreed that Gascony and Ponthieu should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the Hundred Years' War, which was to last 116 years. =1345= Although Gascony was the cause of the war, Edward was able to spare few resources for it, and whenever an English army campaigned on the continent it operated in northern France. Edward determined early in 1345 to attack France on three fronts: A small force would sail for Brittany, under the command of William, Earl of Northampton; a slightly larger force would proceed to Gascony under the command of Henry, Earl of Derby; and the main force would accompany Edward to northern France or Flanders. In early 1345 the French decided to stand on the defensive in the south west. Their intelligence had uncovered the English plan for offensives in the three theatres, but they did not have the money to raise a significant army in each. They anticipated, correctly, that the English planned to make their main effort in northern France. Thus they directed what resources they had to there, planning to assemble their main army at Arras on 22 July. South western France was encouraged to rely on its own resources. Edward III's main army sailed on 29 June. It anchored off Sluys in Flanders until 22 July, while Edward attended to diplomatic affairs. When the ships sailed, probably intending to land in Normandy, they were scattered by a storm and found their way to English ports over the following week. After more than five weeks on board ship, the men and horses had to be disembarked. There was a further week's delay while the King and his council debated what to do, by which time it proved impossible to take any action with the main English army before winter. Aware of this, Philip dispatched reinforcements to Brittany and Gascony. During 1345 Derby had led a whirlwind campaign through Gascony at the head of an Anglo-Gascon army. He decisively defeated two large French armies at the battles of Bergerac and Auberoche, captured French towns and fortifications in much of P√©rigord and most of Agenais and gave the English possessions in Gascony strategic depth. Late in the year he captured the strategically and logistically important town of Aiguillon, \\"the key to Gascony\\". In October the Earl of Northampton commenced a campaign in northern Brittany, but it fizzled out in a series of failures to capture French-held Breton towns and Northampton and most of his force were recalled in the spring. Prelude= French preparations = As always, money was short for the French in 1346. In spite of borrowing over 330,000 florins (¬£ in terms) from the Pope, orders were issued to local officials to: \\"Amass all of the money you can for the support of our wars. Take it from each and every person you can...\\" It was a clear indication of the desperate state of the French finances. Nevertheless, two armies were formed, at Orl√©ans and Toulouse. Duke John of Normandy, the son and heir of Philip VI, was placed in charge of all French forces in south west France, as he had been the previous autumn. In March 1346 the French, numbering between 15,000 and 20,000 and including a large siege train and five cannon, enormously superior to any force the Anglo- Gascons could field, marched on Aiguillon and besieged it on 1April. On 2April the arri√®re-ban, the formal call to arms for all able-bodied males, was announced for the south of France. French financial, logistical and manpower efforts were focused on this offensive. Derby, now known as Lancaster after the death of his father,During the 1345 campaign he was known as the Earl of Derby, but his father died in September 1345 and he became the Earl of Lancaster. sent an urgent appeal for help to Edward. Edward was not only morally obliged to succour his vassal, but also contractually required to; his indenture with Lancaster stated that if Lancaster were attacked by overwhelming numbers, then Edward \\"shall rescue him in one way or another\\". = English preparations = In England, Parliament had voted a large war subsidy in 1344. Much of this had been spent, but some of the proceeds were still being collected. The ability to collect further revenue from English taxpayers was exhausted. As short of money as the French, the English exacted ¬£15,000 in forced loans from church officials; commensurate amounts from English towns; and confiscated a year's income from all benefices held in England by foreigners. Huge orders for military equipment and victuals were placed,Between 1341 and 1346 over one million longbow arrows were ordered. and much was compulsorily purchased. It had long been the case that all Englishmen of military age could be called to arms to defend the country against invaders; in early 1346 this was extended to a requirement to also serve overseas. The English were weary of the apparently pointless and fruitless war, and the previous Parliament, of June 1344, had demanded that Edward \\"make an end to this war, either by battle or by a suitable peace\\". The English intended to gather an even larger army in 1346 than in 1345, over 20,000 men. This was supposed to gather around Portsmouth in February, but the date was postponed for two months, and then for another month. The Scots, incited by Philip, had been perceived as a threat by the English for some time; two years earlier the Chancellor of England had told Parliament the Scots were \\"saying quite openly that they will break the truce as soon as our adversary [France] desires and will march into England\\". Edward exempted the counties north of the River Humber from sending men to join the invasion force, and some limited financial commitments were made to them. It was also feared that with military resources committed to France, the South Coast of England would be exposed to French depredations, as it had been in 1338 and 1339. Extensive measures were taken to guard against this, including placing everyone dwelling within of the sea under the control of local commanders. Both these measures reduced the force available to Edward, as did a degree of resistance to the new conscription regime. In an attempt to make up the numbers, the previous year's expedient of permitting convicted felons to enrol on the promise of a pardon if they served for the duration of the campaign was repeated, with up to a thousand being recruited. In the event he mustered perhaps half of his hoped-for total by the end of June. = Naval preparations = Despite English efforts to conceal their preparations, the French were aware of them. Given the extreme difficulty of disembarking an army other than at a port, the English no longer having access to a port in Flanders, and the existence of friendly ports in Brittany and Gascony, they assumed that Edward would sail for one of the latter; probably Gascony, to relieve Aiguillon. To guard against the possibility of an English landing in northern France, Philip relied on his powerful navy. This consisted of requisitioned merchant ships and hired war galleys. The merchant ships were cogs, with a deep draught and a round hull, propelled by a single large sail set on a mast amidships. They were converted into warships by the addition of wooden \\"castles\\" at the bow and stern and the erection of crow's nest fighting platforms at the masthead. At least 78 were taken into royal service and fitted out as warships in Lower Normandy, and more in Picardy and Upper Normandy. Galleys were oar-propelled and highly manoeuvrable, making them effective for raiding and ship-to-ship combat, but relatively expensive. The French had hired a fleet of at least 32 from Genoa, and it was contracted to arrive in Boulogne by 20 May. In the event, by early July it had not got further than the Tagus roadstead, off Portugal. It has been suggested that the extremely slow progress of the Genoese may have been the result of English bribery. Edward requisitioned the largest fleet assembled by the English to that date, 747 ships. It was scheduled to assemble by 1March; this was first postponed to 1May and then 15 May. By English common law, the king was required to compensate the owners of ships impressed into service, but in practice he paid little and late, which caused shipowners to be reluctant to answer summonses to arms. Edward himself arrived at Porchester on 1June. He had originally planned to land in Brittany, but was frustrated by Northampton's failure to capture a port. He then focused on Gascony, and decided to reinforce Lancaster and confront Duke John of Normandy outside Aiguillon. The fleet took on sufficient supplies for the journey to Bordeaux and sailed from Portsmouth on 28 June. Not all the ships had reached the assembly point and Edward paused off Yarmouth for latecomers to arrive. By the time they had, the wind was foul and the fleet sat off the north east corner of the Isle of Wight for two weeks. This was the normal duration of the whole journey, and ships ran short of food and water. After the debacle of the previous year, Edward decided not to risk disembarking his army with the intention of resupplying and setting off for Bordeaux once more. He was aware that with the French focused on Aiguillon, northern France would be effectively defenceless. So, on 11 July, with the wind still preventing movement down the English Channel, he changed his plans and sailed due south and made landfall at St. Vaast la Hogue, from Cherbourg, on 12 July. The Genoese galley fleet was still well to the south of the major French port of La Rochelle, on the Bay of Biscay. The French cogs converted to warships or in the process of being converted had not yet assembled. Campaign in France=Devastating the Cotentin= The English army was estimated to be between 7,000 and 10,000 strong and consisted of both English and Welsh soldiers combined with specialists and officials. It is considered to have been unusually well equipped for a medieval army and included miners, blacksmiths and Welsh to English interpreters. It included several Norman barons who were unhappy with French rule, including Geoffroy de Harcourt, Viscount of Saint- Sauveur. The region where they landed, the Cotentin Peninsula, was virtually undefended and the English were able to disembark on the long sandy beaches. They spent six days unloading, organising themselves, plundering the countryside and baking bread. This pause was mostly to rest the horses, who would have needed at least this long to recover from being cooped up on board ship for two weeks. The army included a sizeable supply train carrying ammunition, stores, gunpowder weapons and food; the latter could be replaced from local sources to maintain a reserve for when the army needed to concentrate and was unable to forage. Over 50 men were dubbed knights, including Edward's eldest son, in an act of ceremonial preparation for the campaign. The local French commander, Robert Bertrand, led 300 militia in an ineffective attack against the landing. Until a few days before the landing he had also had 500 professional mercenaries under his command, but they had deserted several days earlier because their pay was in arrears. The English achieved complete strategic surprise and marched south, organised in three divisions, or \\"battles\\". Edward's aim was to conduct a chevauch√©e, a large- scale raid, across French territory to reduce his opponent's morale and wealth. Several historians have argued that Edward wished to bring the French to battle, and that his chevauch√©e was intended to provoke Philip into accepting one. While wishing to seize the movable wealth of the areas he crossed, Edward issued strict instructions that no ecclesiastical properties were to be looted, no civilians were to be harmed, and no buildings were to be burnt; he set up a clear enforcement mechanism. However, the English army and the ships' crews were out of his and his nobles' control from the moment they landed. Before the army had even set off from St. Vaast la Hogue the Abbey of Notre-Dame-du-V≈ìu near Cherbourg, a foundation of Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England, was burnt down by Englishmen for the third time in 50 years; la Hogue itself was also burnt down. Once on the march, English soldiers set fire to every town in their path, looted whatever they could from the populace and from private and ecclesiastical establishments and frequently raped the women. The towns of Cherbourg, Carentan, Saint-L√¥ and Torteval were burnt as the army passed, along with many smaller places. The populations of some towns were systematically massacred, in others the bloodshed was more casual. Most French non-combatants in the path of the English fled south, and towns throughout Normandy became clogged with penurious refugees. The English fleet paralleled the army's route, devastating the country for up to inland and taking vast amounts of loot; many ships deserted, their crews having filled their holds. They also captured or burnt over 100 ships; 61 of these had been converted into military vessels. The destruction of these ships much diminished, at least temporarily, French raids against English coastal areas and attacks on English merchant shipping. Bertrand broke the bridges in front of the English army in an attempt to delay it, but they were rapidly repaired by the team of 40 carpenters accompanying the English army. The resistance to the English was weaker than it might have been as a large proportion of the fighting men of Normandy were with Duke John in front of Aiguillon. Raoul, Count of Eu, who was the Grand Constable of France, the senior position in the French military hierarchy, had been hastily transferred north from Aiguillon. He decided to resist the English at Caen, the cultural, political, religious and financial centre of north-west Normandy, larger than any town in England except London. Every available man was dispatched there, and large stocks of food were shipped in. When the English arrived on the morning of 26 July it was defended by 1,500 soldiers, strongly reinforced by the city's militia. The English immediately stormed and captured the city, subsequently looting it for five days. 5,000 French soldiers and civilians were killed as the English rampaged through the town. A small number escaped, fleeing for the nearby woods, pursued by cavalry. English losses were light. Among the handful of prisoners taken was Raoul of Eu. The English discovered a proclamation from Philip instructing Norman raiding parties to despoil the south coast of England, which the Archbishop of Canterbury publicised as evidence that Edward was protecting the Realm; it was also used by English recruiting parties for several years to stir up anti-French feeling. On 29 July Edward sent his fleet back to England, with a letter ordering that reinforcements, supplies and money be collected, embarked and loaded respectively, and sent to rendezvous with his army at Crotoy, on the north bank of the mouth of the River Somme. Money in particular was short, some units had not received their April wages, none had received their wages for the June quarter. Edward's direction of travel was clear, some modern historians argue that his eventual target was already Calais. The English marched out towards the Seine on 1August. Garrisons were left in several places, including Caen and Carenten, but they were rapidly overcome by the French once the main English force had moved on. =March on Paris= The French military position was difficult. Their main army was committed to the intractable siege of Aiguillon. After his surprise landing in Normandy Edward was devastating some of the richest land in France and flaunting his ability to march at will. On 2August a small English force commanded by Hugh Hastings and supported by many Flemings invaded France from Flanders; French defences here were completely inadequate. The treasury was all but empty. Philip immediately recalled his main army, under Duke John, from Gascony. After a furious argument with his advisers, and according to some accounts his father's messenger, Duke John refused to move until Aiguillon fell and his honour was satisfied; the main French army remained tied down in the south west. On 29 July Philip proclaimed the arri√®re-ban for northern France, ordering every able-bodied male to assemble at Rouen, where Philip arrived on the 31st. He immediately moved west against Edward with an ill-organised and ill-equipped army. Five days later he returned to Rouen and broke the bridge over the Seine behind him. On 7August the English reached the Seine, south of Rouen, and raided up to its suburbs. Philip, under pressure from two cardinals sent by Pope Clement, sent envoys offering peace backed by a marriage alliance; Edward replied that he was not prepared to lose marching time to futile discussion and dismissed them. By 12 August, Edward's army was encamped at Poissy, 20 miles from Paris, having left a swath of destruction down the left bank of the Seine, burning villages to within of Paris. The population was in uproar, swollen with refugees, and making preparations to defend the capital street by street. The English carpenters threw a bridge across the Seine after a detachment secured the far bank against strong opposition. Philip again sent orders to Duke John of Normandy insisting that he abandon the siege of Aiguillon and march his army north. On 14 August Duke John requested a formal suspension of the siege. Lancaster, well aware of the situation in the north and in the French camps around Aiguillon, refused. On 20 August, after over five months, the French abandoned the siege and marched away in considerable haste and disorder. There was confusion in Philip's council as to why he did not lead out the French army to attempt to repel the invaders. Instead Philip sent a challenge on 14 August suggesting that the two armies do battle at a mutually agreed time and place in the area. Edward indicated that he would meet Philip to the south of the Seine, without actually committing himself. On 16 August the French moved into position; Edward promptly burnt down Poissy, destroyed the bridge there, and marched north. =March north= alt=A painting of a late medieval battle scene, with knights advancing across a river and fighting on its bank In anticipation of such a move, the French had carried away all stores of food from the region the English were advancing into, forcing them to spread out over a wide area to forage, which greatly slowed them. Bands of French peasants attacked some of the smaller groups of foragers. Philip reached the River Somme a day's march ahead of Edward. He based himself at Amiens and sent large detachments to hold every bridge and ford across the Seine between Amiens and the sea. The English were now trapped in an area which had been stripped of food. The French moved out of Amiens and advanced westwards towards the English. They were now willing to give battle, knowing that they would have the advantage of being able to stand on the defensive while the English were forced to try and fight their way past them. Edward needed to break the French blockade of the Somme and probed at several points, vainly attacking Hangest and Pont-Remy before moving west along the river. On the evening of 24 August the English were encamped north of Acheux while the French were away at Abbeville. During the night the English marched on a tidal ford named Blanchetaque. The far bank was defended by a force of 3,500 French. English longbowmen and mounted men- at-arms waded into the tidal river and after a short, sharp fight routed the French. The main French army had followed the English, and their scouts captured some stragglers and several wagons, but Edward had broken free of immediate pursuit. The French had been so confident that the English could not breach the Somme line that they had not denuded the area, and the countryside was rich in food and loot. So the English were able to resupply, Noyelles-sur- Mer and Crotoy in particular yielding large stores of food, which were looted and the towns then burnt. Meanwhile, the Flemings, having been prevented from crossing the bridge at Estaires by the French, besieged Bethune on 14 August. After several setbacks they fell out among themselves, burnt their siege equipment and gave up their expedition on 24 August. Edward received the news that he would not be reinforced by the Flemings shortly after crossing the Somme. Nor was his fleet waiting with reinforcements at the mouth of the Somme. He decided to engage Philip's army with the force he had. Having temporarily shaken off the French pursuit, he used the respite to prepare a defensive position at Cr√©cy-en-Ponthieu. The French returned to Abbeville and doggedly set off after the English again. =Battle of Cr√©cy= alt=a map showing the positions and movements of the English and French forces at the Battle of Cr√©cy Having decided to offer battle to Philip, Edward chose a defensive position between Cr√©cy and Wadicourt, which each protected one of his flanks, with care. While waiting for the French to catch up with them the English fortified their baggage camp, dug pits in front of their positions and set up several primitive gunpowder weapons. Around noon on 26 August the French van came in sight of the English. At a council of war the senior French officials, who were completely confident of victory, advised an attack, but not until the next day. In the event the French attacked later the same afternoon; it is unclear from the contemporary sources whether this was a deliberate choice by Philip, or because too many of the large number of French knights kept pressing forward and the battle commenced against Philip's wishes. The French numbers are inconsistently reported, but it is clear that their army was very large for the period, and several times larger than the English force. The French unfurled their sacred battle banner, the oriflamme, indicating that no prisoners would be taken. A large force of Italian crossbowmen went forward to engage the English longbowmen in an archery duel. The longbowmen outranged their opponents and had a rate of fire more than three times greater. The crossbowmen were also without their protective pavises, which were still with the French baggage. The Italians were rapidly defeated and fled. The French then launched cavalry charges by their mounted knights at the English men-at-arms, who had dismounted for the battle. These charges were disordered due to their impromptu nature, by having to force their way through the fleeing Italians, by the muddy ground, by having to charge uphill, and by the pits dug by the English. The attacks were further broken up by the heavy and effective fire from the English archers, which caused heavy casualties. By the time the French charges reached the English infantry they had lost much of their impetus. A contemporary described the hand-to-hand combat which ensued as \\"murderous, without pity, cruel, and very horrible\\". The French charges continued into the night, all with the same result: fierce fighting followed by a French repulse. Philip himself was caught up in the fighting, had two horses killed from underneath him, and received an arrow in the jaw. The oriflamme was captured after its bearer was killed. The French broke and fled; the English, exhausted, slept where they had fought. The next morning substantial French forces were still arriving on the battlefield, to be charged by the English men-at-arms, now mounted, routed and pursued for miles. The French losses were very heavy and were recorded at the time as 1,200 knights killed and over 15,000 others. The highest contemporary estimate of English fatalities was 300. The scale of the English victory is described by the modern historian Andrew Ayton as \\"unprecedented\\" and \\"a devastating military humiliation\\". Jonathan Sumption considers it \\"a political catastrophe for the French Crown\\". The battle was reported to the English Parliament on 13 September in glowing terms as a sign of divine favour and as a justification for the huge cost of the war to date. =Siege of Calais= After resting for two days and burying the dead, the English, requiring supplies and reinforcements, marched north. They continued to devastate the land, and set several towns on fire, including Wissant, the normal port of disembarkation for English shipping to north west France. Outside the burning town Edward held a council, which decided to capture Calais; an ideal entrep√¥t from an English point of view, being already strongly defended, possessing a secure harbour and established port facilities, and being in the part of France closest to the ports of south east England. It was also close to the border of Flanders and Edward's Flemish allies. The English arrived outside the town on 4September and besieged it. Calais was strongly fortified; being surrounded by extensive marshes, some of them tidal, which made it difficult to find stable platforms for trebuchets and other artillery capable of breaching its walls. Calais was adequately garrisoned and provisioned, and could be reinforced and supplied by sea. The day after the siege commenced, the English ships expected at Crotoy arrived off-shore and resupplied, re-equipped and reinforced the English army. The English settled down for a lengthy stay, establishing a thriving camp to the west, Nouville, or \\"New Town\\", with two market days each week. A major victualling operation drew on sources throughout England and Wales to supply the besiegers, as well as overland from nearby Flanders. Parliament grudgingly agreed to fund the siege. Edward declared it a matter of honour and avowed his intent to remain until the town fell. The two cardinals representing the Pope travelled between the armies, but neither king would speak to them. French disorder Philip vacillated: on the day the siege of Calais began he disbanded most of his army, to save money and convinced that Edward had finished his chevauch√©e and would proceed to Flanders and ship his army home. On or shortly after 7September, Duke John made contact with Philip, having shortly before disbanded his own army. On 9September Philip announced that the army would reassemble at Compi√®gne on 1October, an impossibly short interval, and then march to the relief of Calais. Among other consequences, this equivocation allowed Lancaster in the south west to launch offensives into Quercy and the Bazadais; and himself lead a chevauch√©e north through Saintonge, Aunis and Poitou, capturing numerous towns, castles and smaller fortified places and storming the rich city of Poitiers. These offensives completely disrupted the French defences and shifted the focus of the fighting from the heart of Gascony to or more beyond its borders. Few French troops had arrived at Compi√®gne by 1October and as Philip and his court waited for the numbers to swell, news of Lancaster's conquests came in. Believing that Lancaster was heading for Paris, the French changed the assembly point for any men not already committed to Compi√®gne to Orl√©ans, and reinforced them with some of those already mustered, to block this. After Lancaster turned south to head back to Gascony, those Frenchmen already at or heading towards Orl√©ans were redirected to Compi√®gne; French planning collapsed into chaos. alt=A colourful image of late-Medieval knights fighting outside a walled town Philip had been calling on the Scots to fulfil their obligation under the terms of the Auld Alliance and invade England since June. The Scottish king, David II, convinced that English force was focused entirely on France, obliged on 7October. He was brought to battle at Neville's Cross on 17 October by a smaller English force raised exclusively from the northern English counties. The battle ended with the rout of the Scots, the capture of their king and the death or capture of most of their leadership. Strategically this freed significant English resources for the war against France, and the English border counties were able to guard against the remaining Scottish threat from their own resources. Even though only 3,000 men-at-arms had assembled at Compi√®gne, the French treasurer was unable to pay them. Philip cancelled all offensive arrangements on 27 October and dispersed his army. Recriminations were rife: officials at all levels of the Chambre des Comptes (the French treasury) were dismissed and all financial affairs were put into the hands of a committee of three senior abbots. The King's council bent their efforts to blaming each other for the kingdom's misfortunes. Philip's heir, Duke John, fell out with his father and refused to attend court for several months. Joan II, Queen of Navarre, daughter of a previous king of France (Louis X), and previously a partisan of Philip, declared neutrality and signed a private truce with Lancaster.  Military operations  alt= A colourful Medieval depiction of a fortification being assaulted Between mid-November and late- February Edward made several attempts to breach the walls with trebuchets or cannon, and to take the town by assault, either from the land or seaward side; all were unsuccessful. During the winter the French made great efforts to strengthen their naval resources. This included French and mercenary Italian galleys and French merchant ships, many adapted for military use. During March and April, over of supplies were run into Calais without opposition. Philip attempted to take the field in late April, but the French ability to assemble their army in a timely fashion had not improved since the autumn and by July it had still not fully mustered. Taxes proved ever more difficult to collect. Several French nobles sounded out the idea of switching their allegiance to Edward. Inconclusive fighting occurred in April and May: the French tried and failed to cut the English supply route to Flanders, the English tried and failed to capture Saint-Omer and Lille. In June the French attempted to secure their flank by launching a major offensive against the Flemings; this was defeated at Cassel. In late-April the English established a fortification on the end of the spit of sand to the north of Calais, which enabled them to command the entrance to the harbour. In May, June and July the French attempted to force convoys through, unsuccessfully. On 25 June the commander of the Calais garrison wrote to Philip saying their food was exhausted and suggesting that they may have to resort to cannibalism. Despite increasing financial difficulties, the English steadily reinforced their army through 1347, reaching a peak strength of 32,000.The largest English army to travel overseas before 1600. , Over 20,000 Flemings were gathered less than a day's march from Calais. 24,000 sailors, in a total of 853 ships supported this force.This is separate from the 747 vessels involved in shipping the army to Normandy in July 1346. On 17 July Philip led the French army north. Alerted to this, Edward called the Flemings to Calais. On 27 July the French came within view of the town, away. Their army was between 15,000 and 20,000 strong; a third of the size of the English, who had prepared earthworks and palisades across every approach. The English position clearly being unassailable, Philip finally admitted the Pope's cardinals to an audience. They in turn arranged talks, but after four days of wrangling these came to nothing. On 1August the garrison of Calais, having observed the French army seemingly within reach for a week, signalled that they were on the verge of surrender. That night the French army withdrew. On 3 August 1347 Calais surrendered. The entire French population was expelled. A vast amount of booty was found within the town. Edward repopulated the town with English, and a few Flemings. Calais was vital to England's effort against the French for the rest of the war, it being widely considered all but impossible to land a significant force other than at a friendly port. It also allowed the accumulation of supplies and materiel before a campaign. A ring of substantial fortifications defending the approaches to Calais were rapidly constructed, marking the boundary of an area known as the Pale of Calais. The town had an extremely large standing garrison of 1,400 men, virtually a small army, under the overall command of the Captain of Calais. Edward granted Calais numerous trade concessions and privileges and it became the main port of entry for English exports to the continent, a position which it still holds. The period of the chevauch√©e, from the landing in Normandy to the fall of Calais, became known as Edward III's annus mirabilis (year of marvels). Aftermath As soon as Calais capitulated, Edward paid off a large part of his army and released his Flemish allies. Several thousand pardons were issued to felons on completion of their military service. Philip in turn stood down the French army. Edward promptly launched strong raids up to into French territory. Philip attempted to recall his army, setting a date of 1September, but experienced serious difficulties. His treasury was exhausted and taxes for the war had to be collected in many places at sword point. Despite these exigencies, ready cash was not forthcoming. The French army had little stomach for further conflict, and Philip was reduced to threatening to confiscate the estates of nobles who refused to muster. He set back the date for his army to assemble by a month. Edward also had difficulties in raising money, partly due to the unexpected timing of the need; he employed draconian measures, which were extremely unpopular. The English also suffered two military setbacks: a large raid was routed by the French garrison of Saint-Omer; and a supply convoy en route to Calais was captured by French raiders from Boulogne. The cardinals acting as papal emissaries found willing listeners in September and by the 28th a truce, known as the Truce of Calais, had been agreed. The truce is considered to have most favoured the English. For its duration the English were confirmed in possession of their extensive territorial conquests in France and Scotland; the Flemish were confirmed in their de facto independence; and Philip was prevented from punishing those French nobles who had conspired, or even fought, against him. So highly regarded was Edward across Europe in the light of his chevauch√©e that he was offered the crown of the Holy Roman Empire by a group of the electors; Edward declined. It ran for nine months to 7 July 1348, but was extended repeatedly over the years until it was formally set aside in 1355. The truce did not stop the ongoing naval clashes between the two countries nor the fighting in Gascony and Brittany. After full-scale war resumed in 1355 it continued until 1360, when it ended with the Treaty of Br√©tigny. Modern historian Clifford Rogers describes this as when: Calais was finally lost by the English monarch Mary I, following the 1558 siege of Calais. The fall of Calais marked the loss of England's last possession in mainland France.

Normally associated with drought, Susna is often described as possessing a snake-like form with horns. He is an enemy of the god Indra.  Description  In Hinduism, Susna is a demon or Asura commonly associated with drought, famine, and hoarding.Chakravarty, U. (1994). INDRA'S PROT√âG√âS IN THE ·πöGVEDA. Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 75(1/4), 51-64. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/41694405 An enemy of Indra, the demon makes multiple appearances across a number of Vedic texts. He is often associated with Vritra, a large dragon which obstructs the rivers of the world. In an etymological context, Susna means \\"drought\\" from the root Sus, which translates to \\"dry up\\". = Appearances in Hindu texts = In the Brahmana and Yajurveda texts within the Vedas, Susna is described as being a bitter enemy (Dasa) of the god Indra. Susna, who is described as a horned serpent-demon, aids the Asuras in their war against Indra and his fellow Deva gods. Whenever an Asura is killed in battle, Susna uses his mystical breath (which contains the essence of the amrta, the fluid of immortality) to restore the fallen warrior to life. Indra discovers these resurrections and plots to steal the amrta for himself and his fellow gods. Thus, Indra turns himself into a globule of honey and allows the demon to consume him. Once inside of Susna's stomach, Indra turns into a falcon (or eagle), steals the amrta from the demon's mouth, and escapes to deliver the prize to the other Devas. In the Rigveda, Susna is described as being a \\"child of mists\\" similar to Vritra, a massive dragon who blocks the rivers of the world. Like Vritra, Susna is seen as a causer of drought and as a foe of Indra. However, while Indra is able to kill Vritra with a lightning bolt, Susna must be destroyed by returning water to the land. To defeat the demon, Indra destroy's Susna's fortress and, at the request of his follower Kutsa, sends rains to end the drought, defeating the demon.

Of the three victims stabbed by Ali, one of the stabbed victims died at the scene while the other two were treated by paramedics and taken to hospital. On 10 November, the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews confirmed that the attack was \\"an act of terror\\" and is being treated as such by counter-terrorism police from both the Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police. Police also confirmed that the attack was Islamic State-inspired.  Incident  On 9 November 2018, at around 4:20 pm, a man set fire to a Holden Rodeo ute on Bourke Street between Swanston Street and Russell Street, at Melbourne city centre. The attacker emerged from the vehicle before it burst into flames. Police stated that there were propane gas cylinders in the vehicle, but they did not explode.Bourke Street, near the location of the attack The man then went on a stabbing spree with a large knife and wounded three pedestrians, one of whom was later pronounced dead at the scene. The attacker was then confronted by two Victoria Police patrol officers who arrived at the scene. A member of the public also attempted to ram a shopping trolley into the attacker. After slashing at the police officers, the attacker was shot once in the chest by one of the officers. The attacker was then disarmed and restrained by Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT) members utilsing less lethal tactics before being taken to receive medical treatment under guard, but later died in hospital. On 10 November, the day following the attack, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews confirmed that \\"what we saw yesterday was an act of terror.\\" The Guardian has described that he has expressed confidence in the Victoria Police to ensure the safety of Melbourne. Officers from both the Victoria Police and from the Australian Federal Police were involved in a counter-terrorism investigation.  Perpetrator  Police identified the attacker as 30-year-old Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, who moved to Australia from Somalia in the 1990s with his parents and siblings and attended Al-Taqwa Islamic College. He was married with a young son. The Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, Graham Ashton, told the media that the attacker was known to federal intelligence agencies but was not actively monitored. The Australian Federal Police's acting national manager of counter-terrorism said Hassan's passport was cancelled in 2015 when ASIO believed he was planning to travel to Syria to fight for the ISIL terrorist group, but he was never a target of joint counter-terrorism taskforce investigations as they did not believe he was a threat. Relatives and acquaintances have described Hassan as having mental health and substance abuse issues, being delusional and agitated prior to the attack, and complaining of \\"being chased by unseen people with spears.\\" Hassan's 21-year- old younger brother, Ali Khalif Shire Ali, was arrested in November 2017 for planning to commit a mass shooting at Melbourne's New Year's Eve celebration. Ali Khalif pled guilty to preparing a terrorist attack and in May 2020 he was sentenced to ten years jail, with a seven and a half years non-parole period.  Victims  Sisto Malaspina, aged 74, was killed when the perpetrator stabbed him above his collar bone. Eyewitnesses said it appeared Malaspina was walking over to the car after it burst into flames to offer assistance when he was stabbed. A former nurse tried to revive him by performing CPR, but the knife had severed a major artery resulting in exsanguination (death due to traumatic blood loss). Malaspina was the co-owner of Pellegrini's Espresso Bar, a nearby Italian coffee bar. Flowers, messages and photos have been laid in front of the shop as a tribute. Those injured were a 58-year-old retired businessman from Launceston, Tasmania, who suffered knife injuries to the head and was taken to the Alfred Hospital for surgery and a 24-year-old security guard from Hampton Park who received lacerations and was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after being assessed by Ambulance Victoria paramedics. Aftermath On 12 November, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, who described Sisto Malaspina as a \\"Victorian icon\\", announced that Malaspina's family had accepted his offer of a state funeral. The City of Melbourne also confirmed it was considering suggestions to rename Crossley Lane, which corners Pellegrini's in honour of Malaspina, telling The Age that \\"In the coming weeks, the City of Melbourne will consider a range of measures to recognise the life of Sisto Malaspina.\\" Following the incident, Prime Minister Scott Morrison made remarks on national television suggesting that Muslim communities in Australia were responsible for the attack, citing their apparent failing to report extremism. The Australian Muslim community responded critically to Morrison's comments. Shiek Mohammed Omran, who runs an Islamic youth centre that Ali visited, replied citing the failure of Australian security agencies, who were aware of the man, for preventing the attack. The Grand Mufti of Australia, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, also responding that Morrison's statement constituted \\"serious discrimination\\" against Muslim Australians. The Mufti too pointed out the inaction of security agencies in preventing the attack.

The term can be used to describe the different causes related to coughing, the 3 main ones being; upper airway cough syndrome, asthma and gastroesophageal reflux disease. It occurs in the upper airway of the respiratory system. Generally, a cough lasts around 1‚Äì2 weeks, however, chronic cough can persist for an extended period of time defined as 6 weeks or longer. People with chronic cough often experience more than one cause present. Due to the nature of the syndrome the treatments that are used are similar however there is a subsequent number of treatments available. Signs and symptoms Common symptoms present in chronic cough include a runny or stuffy nose, a feeling of liquid running down the back of the throat (postnasal drip), frequent throat clearing (coughing) and sore throat, hoarseness, wheezing or shortness of breath, heartburn or sour taste in a person's mouth, and in rare cases coughing blood. =Complications= Long- term coughing and constant irritation of the upper airway can be problematic for individuals that have chronic cough. Due to the consistent coughing, this can interfere with an individual's daily life. This interference can thus cause additional problems such as affecting a person's ability to ensure a consistent sleep, daytime fatigue, difficulty concentrating at work or school, headache, and dizziness. Other more severe but rare complications include fainting, urinary incontinence, and broken ribs, caused by excessive coughing. Causes Possible causes alone or in conjunction can cause the chronic cough which include: * Postnasal drip, when excess mucus is produced in the sinus of the nose and drips back towards the throat, causing a cough reflex also known as upper airway cough syndrome. Postnasal drip can be caused by direct irritation of the post nasal drip or an inflammation of cough receptors in the upper airway. 34% of postnasal drip cases contribute to the cause of chronic cough. * Asthma that affects the upper respiratory tract. Other causes such as cold air or chemicals breathed in can also induce coughing. * Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a common condition where the backflow of stomach acid between the throat and the stomach causes an irritation that can lead to chronic cough. * Infections such as symptoms of pneumonia, flu, cold, or other infections in the upper respiratory tract include coughing that can persists even after the infection has subsided. It is commonly mistaken as a symptom of the infection can be chronic cough, known as whooping cough. * Blood pressure drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is commonly prescribed to individuals with high blood pressure and cardiac failure and are known to have a side effect of chronic cough. * Chronic bronchitis, an inflammation in the major airways such as the bronchial tubules that causes the coughing of coloured sputum. Most carriers of chronic bronchitis have a history of smoking. Due to the nature of chronic bronchitis, it is on a spectrum of smoking-related lung disease also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Because of this spectrum, other lung diseases on the spectrum such as emphysema can co-exist with COPD. It accounts for 5% of chronic cough. * Chemical irritants such as cigarette smoke or other irritants are a common factor that can lead to chronic cough. These irritants typically contribute towards chronic bronchitis. * Other notable rare causes include: aspiration, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, laryngopharyngeal reflux, lung cancer, non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, sarcoidosis. Risk factors Developing a chronic cough can occur from different life style choices. These include smoking cigarettes that the individual smokes themselves or breathes from second-hand exposure. Long-term exposure to smoke can irritate airways and lead to chronic cough and in severe cases lung damage. Other risk-factors include exposure to the air. Individuals that work in factories or laboratories that deal with chemicals have a chance of developing chronic cough from long term exposure. Mechanism Coughing is a mechanism of the body that is essential to normal physiological function of clearing the throat which involves a reflex of the afferent sensory limb, central processing centre of the brain and the efferent limb. In conjunction to the components of the body that are involved, sensory receptors are also used. These receptors include rapidly adapting receptors which respond to mechanical stimuli, slowly adapting receptors and nociceptors which respond to chemical stimuli such as hormones in the body. To start the reflex, the afferent impulses are transmitted to the medulla of the brain this involves the stimulus which is then interpreted. The efferent impulses are then triggered by the medulla causing the signal to travel down the larynx and bronchial tree. This then triggers a cascade of events that involve the intercostal muscles, abdominal wall, diaphragm and pelvic floor which in conjunction together create the reflex known as coughing. Diagnosis There are 3 main types of chronic cough which are the following: * Upper airway cough syndrome is the most common cause of chronic coughing. It is diagnosed when the secretion of excess mucus from the nose / sinus drains into the pharynx or the back of the throat causing an induced cough. * Asthma is the main way to identify the chronic cough as a cause from asthma is that the airflow is obstructed when coughing causes a shortness of breath, wheezing, dyspnea and coughing. * Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is identified with 2 mechanisms which are the distal esophageal acid stimulating the esophageal-treachebronchial cough reflex due to the vagus nerve and the microbial esophageal contents of the pharynx and tracheobronchial causing a cough reflex. =Imaging= * X-rays are used to check for lung cancer, pneumonia and other lung diseases are contributing to the chronic cough. X-rays on the sinus also provide evidence of an infection in the area. * CT scans are used to check the conditions of the patients lungs and to check sinus cavities for infections. * Lung Function Test is a simple test where the patient inhales / exhales into a spirometer normally used to diagnose asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. * Lab tests is a sample of the patients mucus is tested for bacteria * Scope tests is used if the above tests are not able to diagnose the chronic cough, a special test may be used involving a thin, flexible tube which contains a light and camera. This is then inserted within the patient through the respiratory tract. A bronchoscope is used for the lungs and air passages, whilst a biopsy is used for the linings of your airway. Additionally, a rhinoscope can be used to examine the upper airway tract. * Children are typically diagnosed with chest x-rays or spirometry Typical evaluation of chronic cough begins with diagnosing the persons lifestyle choices such as smoking, environmental exposure or medication. From this doctors can opt to use chest radiography if the patient does not smoke, take any angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor, or have a persistent cough after the period of medication. =Concerning findings= A prolonged cough such as one that falls under the chronic cough syndrome can become a medical emergency. Concerning symptoms are: a high fever, coughing of blood, chest pain, difficulty of breathing, appetite loss, excess mucus being coughed, fatigue, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. =Types= By diagnosing which type of cough is present during the chronic cough, individuals can further identify the cause of the chronic cough. These coughs include the following. A Dry cough is a persistent cough where no mucus is present, this can be a sign of an infection. A chronic wet cough is a cough where excess mucus is present and depending on the colour of the phlegm, bacterial infections may be present. A stress cough is when the airways of the throat are blocked to the point that causes a reflexive spasm. A whooping cough is when a ‚Äòwhooping‚Äô sound is present, this is a normally an indication of infection. Treatment * Upper airway cough syndrome treatments include avoiding environmental irritants (chemicals) and offending antigens. This involves treating the sinus with antibiotics to stop nasal drip. Individuals should avoid decongestants found in off the shelf pharmacies to allow rhinitis medicamentosa to work. In severe cases where the cause is not clear, patients should use empiric therapy which is a combination of antihistamine and decongestants. Results typically show within 2 weeks of therapy but can take up to several months for results to show. Absence of standard clinical procedure that test for rhinorrhoea and excess sputum production should not preclude an empiric trial with antihistamine decongestants as they are not effective in treating upper airway cough syndrome. * Treating children who have a non-specific chronic cough with asthma medications such as inhaled beta2-agonists (e.g., salbutamol) or inhaled corticosteroids does not improve the clinical symptoms. *Codeine-based cough medications are contraindicated for children under 12 years old due to the risk of respiratory suppression and the potential for opioid toxicity. *Leukotriene receptor antagonist-based medications and methylxanthines are not recommended for treating children with persistent non-specific cough. *Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) treatments include intense monitoring with a dual channel 24-hour pH probe for diagnosis of the severity of GERD. Other monitors such as nasopharyngoscopy can reveal glottis changes associated with the refluxes that occur. Acid suppressive medication can be taken which include histamine 2 (H2) blockers, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and prokinetic agents. This medication tends to show results within 2 weeks however 6‚Äì8 weeks is ideal for conclusive results. Patients are to remain on treatment for up to 6 months. *Moderate levels of evidence suggest that the use of a clinical pathway that includes an evidence-based algorithm (flow chart) for treating children who have chronic cough may improve clinical outcomes. *There is insufficient evidence to determine if the following approaches are beneficial for treating chronic cough: Treating childhood obstructive sleep apnoea, modifying the indoor air quality, or treatment with inhaled cromones. Epidemiology The prevalence of cough in many communities in Europe and USA is 9‚Äì33% of the population. Chronic cough is more common in those who smoke by threefold compared to people who never smoke. Data analysis shows that exposure to tobacco smoke in a home environment is a risk factor for children due to second hand smoke inhalation. Other causes of chronic cough include higher PM10 concentrations have been related to increase cough and sore throat in children. An increase in nitrogen dioxide has also show a rising association with chronic cough syndrome.  Children A cough that is 4 weeks or longer in duration is considered chronic for children. Most common causes for children include asthma, respiratory tract infections and GERD. Other causes typically diagnosed differently include viral bronchitis, post- infectious cough, cough-variant asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, psychogenic cough and GERD. Due to the way of diagnosis being invasive, typically children are not suitable for diagnosis under the ages of 15. However the bare minimum tests include chest radiography and spirometry.

She is specialist in the migration and trafficking in human beings. She is the founder of the Caminando Fronteras collective. She lives in Morocco, where she denounces the violations of Human Rights in the Western European border and works on supporting and empowerment of the sub-Saharan migrant communities during the migratory process, specially women and children victims of violence.  Trajectory  She was born in El Ejido. There, she began her contact with the migrants as a labor advisor for the Laborers of the Field Syndicate. In 2001 she moved to Morocco with her son Ernesto where she began to build friendships and partnerships with organized migrant communities. It develops research on border externalization, deportations and asylum for organizations such as Sos Racismo, Interm√≥n Oxfam or the Jesuit Refugee Service. She was a delegate in Morocco of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid (CEAR) between 2007 and 2009. She works for Women's Link Worldwide in different reports where she implements the gender perspective to analyze the migration process. Helena has conducted research in Nigeria, Colombia, Germany, Denmark, France, Morocco, and Spain, where she compares and exposes the problem of trafficking as an international and industrial framework of contemporary slavery. She also does this for the Ombudsman of Spain as one of the few external consultants of the institution, being the author of the National Monographic Report on Trafficking in Human Beings. She was a consultant for the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) for the United Nations Rapporteur on the right to international solidarity. She provides training for the General Council of the Judiciary, the Progressist Union of Prosecutors, state and municipal public administrations and social organizations of national and international scope. She writes in Spanish information media for Eldiario.es and P√∫blico. In 2017 she was elected as one of the 10 African women of the year by the newspaper El Pa√≠s. In the field of art, she participates in exhibitions such as Geography and Mobility (Vienna), Utopia (London) and the Political Art Biennial of Cairo. She is the director of several video-reports, editor of the audiovisual piece Frontera Sur, production assistant of the CNN and BBC documentary Living with illegals and screenwriter of \\"Children on the road\\" for Save The Children. In 2015, her collective, Caminando Fronteras, premiered the documentary Tarajal: Transforming pain into justice of which she is a scriptwriter and interviewer. The footage tells the events of the controversial tragedy on the Spanish beach of Tarajal through the perspective of the families of the victims, which are organized in an unprecedented process in sub-Saharan Africa to demand responsibility from European states and achieve justice. In 2020 she was chosen as a member of the expert panel of the international Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity.  Desert accident  On 1 October 2005, the migrant communities reported to Helena massive detentions in Moroccan cities. Hundreds of people were deported and abandoned in the desert, where lots of them ended up dying. By telephone, the defendant reported the situation. Journalist Luis de Vega wrote in ABC, \\"Talk to me. Tell me things to keep me going,\\" that is what they told her in desperate calls \\"24 hours a day\\", so as the journalist said. On 8 October Helena left with a commission that she had organised to take 500 rations of food from Tangier for abandoned migrants and at the same time, to document the tragedy. For the next few days, they followed the convoys with dozens of men, pregnant women and migrant children that were forced to displace themselves to the desert. \\"Valued information that left from the van to the entire world\\", the newspaper ABC told. Nevertheless, after travelling more than 6.000 kilometres by car, an accident occurred with another convoy. Those worse injured were Helena and her colleague Francisco. They were treated at a hospital in El Aai√∫n and then moved to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. She needed several months in wheelchair to recover from her wounds.  Criminalization and international support  For years, the human rights defender has been suffering from calls, persecutions and aggressions that aim to put an end to the work she does through her organization and that has endangered her own life. One of the most serious episodes was the one suffered in the neighborhood of Boukhalef (Tangier) in 2014, when Helena suffered an assassination attempt after trying to protect women and children in racists raids. In August 2017, she received a photo of a gun loaded with the message \\"I suggest silence or you will die, you are bothering the authorities\\". Social organizations launched a campaign in her behalf under the slogan ‚Äúdefend who defends‚Äù, which was signed by more than 500 entities such as Amnesty International, M√©dicos del Mundo, the Andalusian Ombudsman or political parties. Next, the World Organization Against Torture and the International Federation for Humans Rights issued a communiqu√© demanding that the states resolve political responsibilities and guarantee the safety of the human rights defender. On 5 December 2017, Helena Maleno was summoned to appear before the Moroccan judicial system in the Appeals Court. She was accused of \\"people trafficking, and being in favoring of illegal immigration\\". The charges brought against her, mean she can face up to life imprisonment, just for making calls to rescue services to alert them that people attempting to cross the sea were in danger. The judge confirmed that the accusations have been based in four criminal reports prepared by the UCRIF (unity of the Spanish Police in charge of border control). One investigation that began in 2012 without any judicial control, violates the fundamental rights of the Defendant. This was brought to light by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights Defenders of the United Nations in their respective reports on the case. The political persecution has been responded to with an international campaign of solidarity under the slogan #DefendiendoAMaleno (Defending Maleno). More than a thousand organisations and 200 personalities including Luis Garc√≠a Montero, Almudena Grandes, Javier Bardem and Joaqu√≠n Sabina among others, endorsed the manifesto in support of Helena. The case had originally been filed by the Spanish National Court (Audiencia Nacional), but because no crime had been committed, the criminal reports were sent to Morocco. In support of the accused, it was reported that 56,000 emails were sent to the Spanish Home Office and the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in less than 36 hours. These emails demanded that the case be thrown out by the Moroccan court. Institutions such as the Catholic Church, the Madrid City Council or in her hometown (known for its racist episodes), also joined he campaign, which unanimously approved motions in support of the human rights defender., The campaign was as well supported by the President of the Spanish Parliement, Ana Pastor, who declared: ‚ÄúYou are a woman who has left everything to be where help is needed, and to defend the life and the rights of people. The citizens of Span should be supporting you‚Äù. On March 11 of 2019, The Tangier court investigating the case against Maleno for alleged human trafficking overturned it, recognizing his work as a defender of Human Rights. ‚ÄúAt a time when the defense of the rights of migrants is criminalized in Europe, this case file is an exemplary statement to continue our work‚Äù, the defender said after finding out the case resolution. Morrocan human rights organizations celebrated the win as an unprecedented occurrence, that established jurisprudence for the defense of the right to life at the border. One of the main Moroccan newspapers, Akhbar Alyawm headlined: ‚ÄúMoroccan justice internationally embarrasses the Spanish police and overturns the case against Helena Maleno\\".

It is most extensively exposed within the Kahurangi National Park in the Tasman District. The terrane is mostly made up of marble and volcanic rocks but is highly variable in composition. It ranges in age from mid- Cambrian to Devonian time (510‚Äì400 Ma), including New Zealand's oldest rocks, which are found in the Cobb Valley in north-west Nelson. The Cobb Valley is also the location of \\"Trilobite Rock\\" a glacial dropstone made from the moulted exoskeletons of trilobites. Asbestos was mined in the Cobb Valley from the Takaka Terrene between the late 1880s and 1917. The Takaka Terrane is highly deformed and has been intruded by many batholiths.  Description  The Takaka Terrane has two main igneous units, the arc-related Devil River Volcanics Group (Middle to Late Cambrian) and the rift‚Äêrelated Gendarme Dolerite (latest Cambrian to Early Ordovician age). The Devil River Volcanics Group sediments contain trilobites, brachiopods and conodonts. Sedimentary units in the Takaka Terrane (Haupiri Group and Junction Formation rocks) likely formed in a back-arc basin. The distinctive Arthur Marble from Takaka Hill and Mount Arthur is of Ordovician age. It has been speculated that the Takaka Terrane is equivalent to rocks in Tasmania, Australia and was separated from them with the opening of the Tasman Sea. The Arthur Marble has been chemically weathered by rain and groundwater due to its high calcium carbonate content forming a karst geomorphology. This has led to the formation of extensive cave systems like Harwood Hole and the Riuwaka Resurgence.

Description  Gastrodia entomogama is a leafless terrestrial, mycotrophic herb that has a thick, fleshy, brittle, dark brown to blackish flowering stem bearing between five and sixty light brown to dark brown, tube- shaped flowers that are rough and warty outside and white inside. The sepals and petals are joined, forming a tube long. The petals have irregular or wavy edges. The labellum is long, wide and white with orange-coloured edges. Flowering occurs from December to January but the flowers are self- pollinating. Taxonomy and naming Gastrodia entomogama was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen he collected on Mount Franklin in 1990. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (entomogama) is derived from the Ancient Greek words entomon meaning \\"insect\\" and gamos meaning \\"marriage\\" or \\"union\\", referring to the flowers originally being described as insect-pollinated. Distribution and habitat The Brindabella potato orchid grows with shrubs and grasses in forest. It is only known for certain from a few locations in the Australian Capital Territory.

Foley's deputy Michael Daley who became acting leader upon Foley's resignation was formalised into the leadership when he won the caucus vote beating Shadow Water Minister Chris Minns, 33 votes to 12.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-10/nsw-labor-michael-daley-elected- after-luke-foley-resigns/10485066 Background Following the defeat of Labor in the 2015 election, then leader Luke Foley remained as head of the party and opposition despite being in the position for a little more than three months. In October 2018, allegations were raised by NSW Corrections Minister David Elliott about an incident Foley had \\"a little bit too much to drink at a party and harassed an ABC journalist.\\" Later that month, ABC journalist Ashleigh Raper released a statement, alleging that at an event in November 2016, Foley \\"placed his hand down the back of her dress and inside her underpants.\\" Hours later, Foley read a statement in which he resigned as leader of the Labor Party, but denied the allegation and said he would commence defamation proceedings in the Federal Court. As a result, the position of Labor leader and head of the opposition was vacated, three years after the election of Foley as leader. On 9 November, acting leader Michael Daley announced that he will contest the position and was widely tipped to succeed Foley and become New South Wales' 38th Leader of the Opposition. Later in the afternoon, Shadow Minister for Water Chris Minns announced that he intended to contest Daley for the leadership role. This spill comes four months before the March 2019 election. It marks the second time in a row that the party had to elect a new leader just months out from an election. On the previous occasion, John Robertson resigned in December 2014, three months before the March 2015 election and Foley was elected as his permanent replacement.

They are autonomous cooperatives sponsored by the U.S. Department of the Interior, and aim to develop coordinated conservation strategies applicable to large landscape areas. Partnerships are formed with governmental and non-governmental conservation organisations. Similar initiatives have been started or advocated in other parts of the world. Description In response to rapid changes in large landscapes and marine landscapes and uncertain environmental and social changes, conservation organizations need to overcome barriers to cooperation, build governance structures, combine ecological, biological and physical sciences with social science insights, and improve with new information. The Adaptive Common Governance Framework is a social network supported by different stakeholders that uses dynamic learning to provide adaptive information. Inhibitors of adaptive co-governance include deep-rooted organizational culture, conflicting tasks/jurisdiction, and different interests among stakeholders. By providing communication, a platform for building relationships and stakeholder engagement, bridging entities can promote adaptive co-governance. This paper highlights the need for institutionalization of adaptive adaptation of social ecosystems and suggests that landscape conservation cooperatives (LCCs) establish cross-border entities within a broader framework of common governance. Rural Credit Cooperatives is a network of government and non- government protection organizations that promote the protection of rapidly changing social ecosystems by providing the structure and incentives for collaboration and shared learning. Landscape Conservation Modern landscape planning and design is a work that coordinates the relationship between man and nature in the process of human development, social progress and natural evolution. Landscape planning research covers topics such as land development, land use, and environmental quality. Troll proposed the concept of ‚Äúlandscape ecology‚Äù. Think of the landscape as \\"the whole of the space and everything that the vision touches in the human living environment.\\" Buchwald believes that the so-called landscape can be understood as a comprehensive feature of a certain space on the surface. Egler proposed the concept of total human ecosystem. Dansereau advocates the use of \\"human ecology\\" to study the impact of humans on the landscape. McHarg proposed to use the entire human ecosystem as a target for landscape ecology and landscape ecological planning. The process of landscape planning is to help people living in natural systems or using the resources in the system to find the most appropriate route (McHarg, 1969). It is a plan based on ecological theory and knowledge (Sedon, 1986, Leita and Ahern, 2002). Landscape ecology considers the lithosphere, biosphere and wisdom circle in the human living space as an integral part of the overall human ecosystem, and studies the structural and functional relationships between the various landscape elements (relatively homogeneous ecosystems). Landscape ecology is the guiding theory of landscape ecological design. The landscape ecological design with the information society as the background is the process of human beings to actively arrange and coordinate the elements of the overall landscape (including natural and cultural). All elements of the landscape as a design variable and goal, ultimately optimize the landscape system structure and function. Landscape planning provides a comprehensive solution through close collaboration with spatial planning. Landscape planning has gradually expanded to the areas of river basin planning, regional planning, land planning, and ecological remediation and restoration. The objects directly faced by landscape planning have been extended to the land complex. Landscape planning is a material spatial plan with the overall goal of achieving sustainable landscapes or ecosystems through land and natural resource conservation and utilization planning. Landscape ecological planning has the following basic principles: natural priority principle, overall design principle, design adaptability principle and multidisciplinary comprehensive principle. Beta Langfi pointed out that \\"it is not only to study parts and processes in isolation, but also to study the interaction of various parts. The organism should be considered as a whole or system. Environmental protection requires systematic thinking. Landscape planning is required for overall planning.  Implementation  Maintaining biodiversity by protecting a representative and well-connected habitat network in a managed landscape requires wisely protecting, managing and restoring habitats on multiple scales. Scholars suggest that the integration of natural sciences and social sciences in the form of ‚Äútwo-dimensional gap analysis‚Äù is an effective tool for implementing biodiversity policies. The tool links biologically relevant ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù ecological issues to ‚Äúvertical‚Äù issues related to institutions and other social issues. Taking forest biodiversity as an example, it is illustrated how to combine the ecological and institutional aspects of biodiversity conservation to promote environmentally sustainable regional development. In particular, people use regional gap analysis to identify local forest types and determine habitat modeling for ‚Äúgreen infrastructure‚Äù functional connectivity as a tool for horizontal gap analysis. For the vertical dimension, it is suggested how to assess the success of social sciences in implementing biodiversity policies in real landscapes by identifying institutional barriers when implementing policies. It is believed that this interdisciplinary approach can be applied to a range of other environments, including other terrestrial biota and aquatic ecosystems, where functional habitat connectivity, non-linear response to habitat loss, and multiple economic and social benefits occur together. In the same landscape. Landscape conservation partners at Konza Prairie There is a clear need for policies and practices that integrate biodiversity issues into sectors outside the protected area, especially in view of the local authorities‚Äô extensive decentralization of land use decisions. Therefore, people must develop systematic (target-driven) protection planning products that are both user- friendly and useful to users, and are applicable to local government officials, consultants, and elected decision makers. Through the systematic conservation planning assessment of subtropical jungle biomes in South Africa, implementation opportunities and constraints are considered from the outset to work with stakeholders to develop products (maps and guides) that can be used for local government land use planning. Assessing joint input with stakeholders, developed (i) Megaconservancy Networks, a multi-ownership large conservation corridor for biodiversity processes; (ii) protection status categories for all biodiversity characteristics (extremely endangered), endangered, fragile, not currently vulnerable), achieving conservation goals based on existing habitats, and (iii) integrating (i) and (ii). The map was further explained to municipal decision makers through the corresponding land use guidelines for each type of conservation status. In order to raise awareness of the value of biodiversity and its services, a handbook was prepared, which also introduces new and upcoming environmental legislation. Within 18 months of producing these products, the evidence that maps and their guidelines are effectively integrated or mainstreamed into land-use planning is encouraging. However, there is still a need to increase efforts to raise awareness of the value of biodiversity and its services among many stakeholder groups. Despite this, the way people plan to implement by considering the needs and obligations of end users has produced positive results. Finally, suggestions for further improvements are proposed.  Influence  In 2010, Arctic LLC provided approximately $2 million in funding for climate-related research and data integration, and provided the same amount of support through in-kind contributions to the workforce and funding from other agencies and NGOs. One product of this initial cycle is the report \\"Integrating the Alaska Landscape into the Future.\\" The project uses a climate envelope model approach to assess how future climate scenarios match the average temperature and precipitation conditions from 2000 to 2009. The results indicate that approximately 60% of Alaska may be transformed into a new climatic biome in the twenty-first century. . In 2011, approximately $1.3 million in funding from the Arctic LCC and $1 million in leverage will support more than 20 different research and data integration projects. With the development of a long-term scientific plan, the ALCC Steering Committee makes a temporary selection of proposals based on responsiveness, feasibility, level of cooperation, response to management issues, and many other criteria for ALCC objectives. Currently, six technical working groups - permafrost, coastal processes, climate simulation, hydrology, Arctic biology and geospatial data - provide input for the development of the Arctic LCC Science Program, which will guide future project financing strategies. The draft plan will be published at the end of 2011. Landscape Conservation Cooperatives Influence As the area covered by natural ecosystems decreases, the protection of tropical biodiversity in agricultural landscapes becomes even more important. The Shadow Coffee Cooperative in El Salvador analyzed the impact of local livelihoods, types of cooperation and selected biophysical variables (altitude, slope, percent shade, forest distance, coffee density and coffee age) on tree biodiversity. The tree stock of 51 samples from the coffee cooperative included 2,743 individuals from 46 families and 123 identified tree species. Some cooperatives have different species richness and diameter, and the greater the abundance, the greater the stem density; other biophysical variables have little effect on diversity. The amount of shadows in coffee plantations varies among cooperatives, especially during the rainy season. Among the species recently reported in a study of neighbouring forests and cooperatives (N = 227 species), 16% were present in two locations. Three coffee plantations account for 35% of the total number of species reported by all cooperatives. Studies have shown that the number of tree species found in coffee plantations increases with the density of shady trees contained in the system. In turn, agro-ecological management influenced by farmers' livelihood strategies and types of cooperation directly affects the composition of the shady canopy. Important factors to consider are the type of farmer organization, the cost of maintaining protected species, and the potential benefits of protecting a livelihood strategy that may be for farmers.  Consequence  The field of system protection planning has matured to the extent that it can be effectively applied on the mainland. Influenced by computer science to conservation biology, it uses a quantitative geospatial approach to spatially prioritize conservation decisions (Ball et al. 2009). The basic feature is to protect ecosystems, species and processes in the network that are related to environmental change and that can adapt to environmental changes (Anderson, 2014). The LCC system is very broad in space and is well suited to applied science to achieve these outcomes: (a) the layout of core protected areas, (b) creating network connectivity to address climate change, and (c) assessing land-use vulnerability changes, ( d) combine social constraints with biodiversity and ecosystem services goals, and (e) compare options. Landscape Conservation Cooperatives Consequence While system protection plans require a large data set on protection goals, the LCC structure helps capture this data, saving money when partners share data and expertise. LCC Science is conducted by conservation scientists from academic institutions, private companies and NGOs. As stakeholder engagement improves the science of systems protection planning, this collective ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù approach provides modelers with a source of expertise that is critical to establishing conservation goals, setting goals and reviewing results. . . Finally, the LCC structure is exactly the same as the dissemination results, because the collaborators form a channel back to their institutions, organizations, institutions and the public. Twenty-two low-cost lines are further connected to the National Network Coordinator and Small Employee Network. LCC has previously implemented multi-state and non-governmental organization wildlife conservation initiatives. However, these are difficult to maintain because there are no federally-managed cooperatives to fund and organize the required spatially clear data to help prioritize regional protection spending. When rural information centers focus on the entire landscape, species and ecosystems, ecological processes, human impacts and interests, and priorities for time and space actions, they often plan (if implemented) to protect the country's biodiversity.

The text are poems by the composer based on the New Testament.  History  Messiaen composed the work at the Lac de P√©tichet in the summer of 1936, setting his own poems. He specifically called for a grand soprano dramatique (great dramatic soprano), probably with the voice of Marcelle BunletMarcelle Bunlet on Great Opera singersMarcelle Bunlet on BnF in mind, who was a notable singer of Br√ºnnhilde at the time. Messiaen dedicated the cycle to his first wife, Claire Delbos, a violinist and composer. It is one of three major song cycles, with Harawi and Chants de Terre et de Ciel, and the only one which he also orchestrated, the following year in Paris. The piano version was premiered on 28 April 1937 as a concert de la Spirale, by Marcelle Bunlet and the composer at the piano. It was published by Edition Durand. The first performance of the orchestra version took place at the salle Gaveau in Paris on 4 June 1937. The soprano Marcelle Bunlet was accompanied by the orchestra of the Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire, conducted by Roger D√©sormi√®re.  Text structure and scoring  In his poems, Messiaen paraphrases verses from the New Testament in \\"surrealist poetry\\". The poems can be seen as depicting first a couple's spiritual struggle, then their journey together. In this work, the rhythmic language uses very irregular durations, and certain processes dear to the author: added values, added points, non-retrogradable rhythms, plus some borrowings from Greek metrics and Hindu rhythmics. The \\"Mi\\" syllable of the title is a word of affection, imitating a diminutive, and the nickname of the dedicatee. # Action de gr√¢ces # Paysage # La Maison # √âpouvante # L'√©pouse # Ta voix # Les deux guerriers # Le collier # Pri√®re exauc√©e The work is scored for soprano solo, four flutes, three oboes (also Cor Anglais), two clarinets, three bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, percussion (three players) and strings. The duration is given as 32 minutes.

She was among the first four women to be elected to the Municipal Council of Frederiksberg in 1909 as well as one of the first four to be elected to the Folketing (the Danish national parliament) in 1918. Biography Born on 18 July 1859 in Ish√∏j, Karen Marie Ankersted Hansen was the daughter of the farmer Niels Hansen (died 1885) and Marie Nielsen (c.1822‚Äì1869). She was brought up in Copenhagen by a foster mother, Hanne Kopp, who was a teacher. After attending Testrup Folk High School, she trained to be a private teacher at N. Zahle's School, receiving her diploma in 1881. From 1883 to 1888, she taught at Borgerdyd School in Christianshavn, gradually gaining admission to the Copenhagen Municipality's schools authority. As a result, she taught at Gasv√¶rksvejen School and Haderslevgade School until 1916 when declining health forced her to leave. Although rather conservative in her outlook, Ankersted was a supporter of women's rights but did not campaign with the activists. By contrast, she played an active part in Copenhagen Municipality's Teachers Association on its establishment in 1891, becoming its chair for two periods (1905‚Äì1906 and 1910‚Äì1912). She also became active in the Women's Council. On the political front, she was a conservative, becoming a member of the H√∏jre party which in 1915 became the Conservative People's Party. On 1 April 1909, she was elected to the Municipal Council of Frederiksberg where she remained until 11 November 1918. Standing for Aarhus, Anhersted was elected to the Folketing in the 1918 elections, the first time women had been able to participate. She was one of four women who were elected, the others ‚Äî all standing for Copenhagen ‚Äî were Helga Larsen (Social Democrats), Elna Munch (Social Liberals) and Mathilde Malling Hauschultz (Conservative People's Party). She was not re-elected in the April 1920 election but only left the Rigsdag until the following August when she entered the Landsting for her last few months.

Biography  Arnold grew up on his parent's estate in Sontheim in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. From an early age on, he received instruction in music from his father, a music director. He studied theology and philosophy in T√ºbingen and Freiburg and received his doctoral degree in 1832. His professional life began in Cologne where he worked as a feuilleton editor, a theater and opera critic, choir director of the German Opera and as dramatic advisor. Between 1835 and 1840 he was director and co-owner of Eck & Comp., a music publisher and supplier in Cologne. During this period Arnold also wrote historical short stories and, between 1835 and 1841, published several as novellas. He also prepared a number of volumes of the music periodical \\"\\" (\\"Penny Magazine for Song and Guitar\\") as well as publishing his own arrangements for guitar, piano and violin. In 1836 he married Maria Henriette Amalia Frambach (1805‚Äì1867), daughter of the director of public finances of the city of Cologne Johann Heinrich Frambach (1771‚Äì1821). The couple had three children: Ursula (born 1837), Jakob (1840‚Äì1877) and Agnes (1843‚Äì1876). (Municipal Archive, Registry Office Elberfeld, Births 1843, Document no. 1071) Ursula, also known as Lina, received piano instruction from Clara Schumann and Johannes Brahms, with both of whom she maintained contact throughout her life.Letter to Johannes Brahms from Lina Souchon, n√©e Arnold, written January 8, 1877. The Brahms-Institut at the Musikhochschule L√ºbeck, No. 335a, 2 Jakob, who also went by the name Emil, took over his father's business after his death. In 1841 Arnold moved to Elberfeld, founded his own music business and, seven years later, a music publishing house. He published over 700 works, including pieces by Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Liszt, Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert. He had business relations and personal contact to several contemporary composers including Robert and Clara Schumann as well as Johannes Brahms. As of 1850 Arnold was increasingly occupied with research on the German folk-song. In this he collaborated with like-minded scholars such as Philipp Wackernagel, Anton Wilhelm von Zuccalmaglio, Karl Simrock, Johannes Brahms and Ludwig Uhland. One outcome of his extensive research was his folk-song collection \\"\\" (\\"German Folk-Songs from Old and New Times\\") which was published posthumously. In the late 1850s Arnold gained access to the \\"Locheimer Liederbuch\\" (\\"Lochamer Song Book\\"), a manuscript with songs from the late Middle Ages to the early Renaissance, which he began to edit. In 1863 the editor of the \\"\\" (\\"Annals of Musical Science\\"), Friedrich Chrysander, invited Arnold to submit this work for publication. Shortly before his death on February 12, 1810, resulting from a stroke, Arnold sent his manuscript to Chrysander.

Severe poisoning can result in haemolytic anaemia. Naphthalene was introduced in 1841 by Rossbach as an antiseptic to counteract typhoid fever. Although naphthalene was widely used industrially, only nine cases of poisoning have been reported since 1947. As a result, the condition has limited coverage within medical journals.  Sources of Exposure  Until the late 1950s coal tar was the principal source of naphthalene. From 1981 to 1983 the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found over 100,000 workers were potentially exposed to toxic levels of naphthalene, working primarily for major industrial and agricultural businesses. Exposure may often be a result of oral ingestion, inhalation, or through prolonged skin exposure. =Industrial chemistry= Naphthalene is a precursor in the production of phthalic anhydride. This application has been displaced by alternative technologies. =Mothballs= Naphthalene is a major component of some mothballs. It repels moths as well as some animals. Since mothballs that contain naphthalene are considered hazards, safer alternatives have been developed, such as the use of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, however, 1,4-dichlorobenzene has been declared as a potential neurotoxin. 1,4-dichlorobenzene has been linked to potentially causing depression as a form of encephalopathy. This complication resulted with an increased use of Camphor as a moth repellent. Camphor is frequently used in place of naphthalene in Asia. Regulation The European Union enforced a ban on the distribution and production of mothballs containing naphthalene in 2008, as a part of the new regulations of the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH), regulating chemical use within its representative countries. In 2014, New Zealand banned the distribution of mothballs. Mothballs are restricted within Australia, only being distributed in forms that prevent them from being ingested. =Tobacco= Tobacco is also a source of exposure, creating an estimated range of 0.3 to 4 micrograms of naphthalene inhalation per cigarette that is consumed. A regular pack a day smoker on average would be inhaling amounts of 6-80 micrograms of naphthalene daily, which is a small and negligible amount of naphthalene, and is similar in magnitude to normal exposure near highways and areas where car exhaust is frequently inhaled or consumed. The naphthalene within cigarettes is different to other sources of naphthalene. The naphthalene that is produced in cigarette smoke is bound to other particles and is not presented as a free vapour, meaning the exposure is small. Naphthalene exposure is usually insignificant unless exposed to large amounts of naphthalene within production or being near proximity of a product that contains naphthalene. Naphthalene levels within an area are very unstable and frequently change over time and space. Due to this variance, sampling protocols must be conducted carefully and are usually analysed using different analytical methods. =Natural occurrence= Naphthalene has also been found to be secreted by termites in order to protect their nests. The termites use naphthalene to repel ants and any intruders who try to invade their nests. This naphthalene produced is not only toxic for the insects but can also affect humans in the same way. Naphthalene poisoning via termite nest was featured in the eleventh episode of the first season of the American television medical drama House, \\"Detox\\", where the final diagnosis ended up as acute naphthalene poisoning as a result of a termite nest being contained within the walls of the patient's bedroom, leading him to inhale naphthalene in his sleep and becoming sick.  Treatment  Treatment of naphthalene toxicity usually follows the same treatments involved for haemolytic anaemia, which involves a series of blood transfusions, in order to restore healthy levels of haemoglobin. This may include intravenous methylene blue and ascorbic acid. The methylene blue allows the methaemoglobin to be converted to haemoglobin. Supportive treatment is also usually provided, depending on the severity of the toxicity, that resulted in the anaemia. Ascorbic acid is used to treat methemoglobinemia, a symptom of naphthalene poisoning and is used when methylene blue is not available, or in conjunction with methylene blue in order to restore haemoglobin count.  Mechanisms of toxicity  According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, naphthalene is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B), as there is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of naphthalene, however there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of naphthalene. The carcinogenicity was tested on rats in mice, via intraperitoneal administration and subcutaneous administration, of newborns and adult rats, providing evidence of tumours. The IARC also discovered that naphthalene toxicity also had potential to cause cataracts in humans, rats, rabbits and mice, however the tests were considered inefficient to substantiate a diagnosis resulting in naphthalene as a potential carcinogen classification. Likewise, the European Chemical agency classified naphthalene as Group C, a possible human carcinogen. This was classified due to lack of evidence of naphthalene alone causing carcinogenic properties in rats, and limited human contact with naphthalene within industrial environments. Haemolysis occurs either through haemoglobin defects, such as formation of Heinz bodies, or cell membrance defects, especially those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and a low tolerance to oxidative stress. This haemolysis is usually accompanied by neurological effects such as vertigo, lethargy and convulsions, usually caused by cerebral edema. Gastrointestinal bleeding may also appear as a symptom after ingestion of mothballs, especially for those who are younger. Acute exposure to naphthalene is unlikely to cause toxicity and must be ingested unless prolonged contact is provided along the skin or eyes. After ingestion of mothballs containing naphthalene, symptoms of haemolytic anaemia are presented and treated normally through the use of methylene blue and regular blood transfusions, and patients are usually released after 6-10 days depending on their haemoglobin levels. Repeated naphthalene exposure has also been found to potentially cause airway epithelial damage, aberrant repair, and inflammation. Greater numbers of peribronchial Mac-3-positive macrophages and CD3-positive T-cells were observed throughout the airways which displays acute inflammation within the airways. Naphthalene metabolites of 1,2-hydroxynaphthalene has also been found to be a mechanism of oxidative DNA damage within humans. In the presence of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH).The damaging activity of the DNA of the activity of 1,2-hydroxynaphthalene was observed at much larger levels. 1,2-hydroxynaphthalene is reduced by NADH to be formed as a part of the redox cycle, resulting in the speeding up of DNA damage, however, this is only presented within larger prolonged exposure to naphthalene, values that are unrealistic for any individual not working near a place where naphthalene production occurs. = Biomarkers of excessive exposure = 1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene has been used as a potential biomarker of excessive exposure to naphthalene levels and was tested on smokers and those exposed to naphthalene among the working population. After collecting the urine samples of multiple workers, Median 1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene values were 1012 micrograms per litre for those exposed to naphthalene and 8 micrograms per litre for those who were in the control group indicating that it is useful as a biomarker for exposure within humans. The median results for the concentrations of 1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene were about ten times the amount of the standard markers of 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol within human urine.

She was a recipient of the Om Muthu Mari Award of the University of Madras. Life Poongani was born in 1934 in Saravanan Theri near Agastheeswaram in the Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu at the tip of India. She attended school till fourth grade but family circumstances did not permit her to continue. At the age of either 10 or 12 she saw a troupe performing the villu paatu at a local temple. Two notable women exponents of the art-form, Lakshmi and Dhanalakshmi, encouraged her to pursue it. She then learned from Vedhamanikkam Pulavar and Sivalingam Vathiyar, maestros of the tradition. Poongani began performing with a troupe in which Thangapandian, a percussionist of the kudam (a clay pot instrument), was a member. They married when she was fifteen years old, and continued to perform together. Thangapandian died in 2015. Poongani lived in penury on a small pension in Kottaaram near Nagercoil, until her death on 2 November 2018, although in her final year her residence was given a polish. Lady Kash, a Tamil rapper from Singapore, visited her and cleaned her home. Her visit saw Poongani again at the centre of attention. The press reported that Lady Kash had created a song named \\"Villupattu\\" in her honour. Career The villu paatu is a long-form musical story-telling tradition. It is performed with a stringed bow, accompanied by a troupe of musicians, and involves a call and response between the lead singer and the accompanists. Poongani developed a technique of bow playing along with a unique twirl of veesukol, twin thick sticks with bells, with which she would strike the bow. The ritual song traditionally lasted three days, telling the stories of regional deities but also expanded to include tales from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. The performances were generally the curtain call to religious festivals at Mutharammam and Sudalaimadan temples. Poongani and her troupe performed around southern Tamil Nadu and Kerala for more than fifty years, until her retirement at the age of 70. Poongani was credited with knowing almost the entire classical repertoire of the villu paatu, as well developing new songs. She also taught younger generations of artistes.

MacSwiney Brugha went to live with Madame O‚ÄôRahilly, widow of The O'Rahilly, and saw her mother intermittently. Although as a child her parents decided she would speak Irish, her father's death and her mother's health meant that she was moved to Germany in 1923 and there she was moved around a lot. She learned German and spoke no English and little or no Irish. In 1930 MacSwiney Brugha was moved to Grainau, in Bavaria where she attended school. Her aunt Mary MacSwiney, a legal guardian of hers, eventually came to collect her and took her back to Ireland. This caused a court case when it was claimed her aunt had kidnapped her.

Biography John Gabor was born in Chicago, Illinois to an Irish-American family. In 1939, his family relocated to the south of San Francisco, when he was about 10. He became interested in combat fighting at a young age when his uncle brought him to boxing matches and he grew to admire profession wrestlers such as Lou Thesz and Bobby Managoff, both of whom he would wrestle with later in his career. Gabor was trained in gyms, where wrestlers \\"beat him up badly just to see how much he wanted to learn\\". According to Mercury News, \\"Von Goering is one of the few successful wrestlers who does not have an amateur background; he isn‚Äôt the product of a wrestling academy, nor did he rise up through the college or Olympic ranks.\\" Gabor started wrestling in aftermath of World War II, when it was common for heels (villains) to be portrayed as being from countries in the Axis Powers. Despite not being of German descent, he was billed as \\"Fritz von Ulm\\", until a promoter in Minnesota altered it to include the Goering surname, which was based on Nazi Party figure Hermann G√∂ring. As part of his character, he was billed as being from various German cities, but in reality had never been out of the United States at that point. Eventually his character was modified to be of East German origin, after relations with West Germany softened during the Cold War. During his career, he captured several tag team championships. In 1962, he won the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. Frequent rivals included Thesz and Managoff, as well as Dick Hutton, Pat O'Connor, and Bronko Nagurski. He was also paired against Buddy Rogers; Von Goering stated that he \\"hated [Roger's] guts offstage as well as on\\". He finished his career in Roy Shire's Big Time Wrestling promotion, where he teamed with Luke Graham. After retiring in 1973, Gabor moved to Campbell, California with his wife, Kay. He found work as a truck driver and a car salesman, which he said he sometimes found more difficult than wrestling. At the behest of Thesz, Gabor supported the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame after its creation in 1999. In 2009, he was personally inducted into the hall of fame, which typically inducts wrestlers with a background in amateur wrestling. Mike Chapman, then-executive director of the museum which oversaw the hall of fame stated: \\"Even though he never had an amateur background, Fritz was voted in quite easily, frankly, because the hall of fame recognized the kind of respect he had in the ring.\\" Championships and accomplishments *George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame ** Class of 2009 *NWA San Francisco **NWA World Tag Team Championship (San Francisco version) (1 time) ‚Äì with Gene Dubuque *Pacific Northwest Wrestling **NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship (2 times) - with Maurice Vachon (1), Kurt von Poppenheim (1) *Stampede Wrestling **Alberta Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Charro Azteca *Western States Sports **NWA International Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Mike Padosis ReferencesExternal links *Fritz Von Goering at the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum American male professional wrestlers American people of Irish descent Fictional Nazis Living people Professional wrestlers from Illinois Year of birth missing (living people) 1920s births ","title":"Fritz Von Goering"},{"id":"59009631","text":"Front view of the school (2007) Rear view (2007) Grundschule an der Herrnstra√üe (Public school on Herrnstra√üe) was founded in 1882. The school building is one of the oldest still intact Volksschule (public school building) in Munich and, at the same time, one of the oldest school buildings in the city. It is located in the northeastern Graggenauviertel of the old town.  History  The school was opened in 1882, in the middle of the old town as the second Protestant public school in Munich after the, Herzog- Wilhelm School on Glockenbach, built in 1848 by Frank Jakob Kreuter. The school survived the Second World War unscathed, although half of the houses in the city center were bombed. After the Second World War, Catholic students were also allowed to attend school. The first 40 Deutsche Mark were handed over there to the citizens of Munich after the currency reform in 1948. In the post-war period, up to 70 students were taught there in one classroom in shifts. Since 1969, the school houses the mainstream school, the Grundschule an der Herrnstra√üe and a special school, today's Special Needs Education Center Munich. The city hoard and full-time childcare were added later. The municipal kindergarten is located on the long side of the playground in the one-storey post-war pavilion. Since 2005, the special needs educational counseling center is also in the Herrnstra√üe 21. The elementary school is next to the Sinai-elementary school in the Jewish Community Center, the only one of this kind of school in the old town center. Although the number of pupils in this district has declined sharply, it has been possible to suspend the process of dissolution of the elementary school which has been initiated due to long-term unsuccessful student numbers, since there were sufficient pupils in the school year 2005/06.

History  Rancho Laguna was part of the grazing lands granted to the Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, founded in 1772 by Father Jun√≠pero Serra in San Luis Obispo County, California. These lands were lost to the Catholic Church due to the Mexican secularization act of 1833. With the Secularization act of 1833, the mission pasture and garden lands were sold or granted to Mexican citizens as ranchos over the next thirteen years. On the 16th of July, 1844, Governor Micheltorena granted to Bishop Francisco Garc√≠a Diego y Moreno the Mission San Luis Obispo a vinyard, garden and a square league of grazing land around the Laguna for the support of worship. In 1845, the buildings of Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa except for the chappel, were sold by Governor Pio Pico to John Wilson, everything except the church chapel was sold for a total of $510 (valued at $70,000 in 1845).

It arose as a result of South African government interventions into the traditional farming practices of the Basotho, specifically those that limited the number of stock Basotho could keep and required the culling of excess. Passive resistance to the government‚Äôs legislation had escalated in the 1940s to active disobedience, when in November 1950 a confrontation between police and Basotho farmers turned violent. Fourteen Basotho were killed, and eight others deemed to be ringleaders were later sentenced to terms of imprisonment and banishment from Witzieshoek. Paulus Mopeli Mokhachane, great-grandfather to leader of the 1951 Namoha resistance, Paulus Howel Mopeli Overview In the 1950s, Witzieshoek (modern day Phuthaditjhaba) was part of a parcel of land bordering Lesotho in the former Orange Free State of South Africa that was designated as a native reserve of the Basotho ethnic group. The land, approximately 40,000 hectares, had been ceded to the Basotho under Paulus Mopeli ‚Äì half-brother to King Moshoeshoe I of Lesotho ‚Äì by the president of the Orange Free State Johannes Brand, in a peace treaty known as the \\"Khotso ya Mabele\\" or \\"Peace of Millet\\" in 1866.\\"Resistance and banishment in Wietzehoek\\". SAHO. Accessed: 10 October 2018 In 1936, the Native Trust and Land Act was passed by the South African parliament. This Act effectively created a body responsible for acquiring and maintaining small strips of land intended for blacks to farm and cultivate; in the name of \\"betterment\\", the body would come to impose laws permitting the culling of stock to avoid overgrazing.\\"Witzieshoek: women, cattle and rebellion\\". BEERSTECHER, S (Pg 1). University of Cape Town. Accessed: 10 October 2018 This intervention was met with resistance by the Basotho in Witzieshoek and in the 1950s, after a series of protests and court actions, a stand-off between the community and local authorities turned violent, resulting in the deaths of more than thirteen people.Barnard, L; Stemmet, J; Semela, S (Pg 185). THE BATTLE OF NAMOHA, QWA- QWA (1950):AN ORAL HISTORY PERSPECTIVE . University of the Free State. Accessed: 10 October 2018 Disputes over livestock Under Proclamation No/ 31 of 1939, Witziehoek was declared a Betterment Territory, the first of many such schemes by the government within native reserves. With this, the government hoped to be able to concentrate the Basotho into a smaller area and, in turn, conserve the broader area with the most arable land for white farmers. By the 1940s, the state had placed a limit on the number of livestock per person living within the reserve. The authorities and locals came to an agreement where surplus cattle would be culled. But the Basotho began to regard the Betterment Scheme as a hindrance, limiting their ability to rely on their livestock for survival and destroying their traditional and cultural exchange mechanisms.Barnard, L; Stemmet, J; Semela, S (Pg 189). THE BATTLE OF NAMOHA, QWA-QWA (1950):AN ORAL HISTORY PERSPECTIVE . University of the Free State. Accessed: 10 October 2018 In 1942, the cattle-bearing capacity of Witzeihoek was identified as approximately 12,500 head, but by 1946 the reserve held 13,500 head of cattle. The state intended to cull the excess cattle and restore the reserve to its calculated maximum capacity. Their plan was met by resistance from within the reserve's community, under the leadership of Paulus Howel Mopeli, great-grandson of Paulus Mopeli. Mopeli refused to allow his cattle to be culled, and he and three other cattle owners appeared in court for disobeying the authorities, although the case was set aside. Mopeli's actions were regarded as heroic and inspired a wave of resistance across the reserve, with many other stock owners refusing to have their cattle culled.  Mass resistance By the end of 1949, the Basotho community‚Äôs defiance ranged from passive resistance to active sabotage. Approximately three kilometres of fencing running along the demarcated reserve were destroyed, and some white farmers' plantations were partially burnt. The Native Commissioner failed to heed the continuing outcry from the Basotho over the slaughtering of their cattle.Barnard, L; Stemmet, J; Semela, S (Pg 190).

Accessed: 10 October 2018 The culling that was scheduled to take place on 8 January 1950 came to mark a turning point in the Basotho resistance movement.

On 14 March, approximately three hundred men and women returned their stock cards and land allotment certificates to Native Trust officials. In response, a letter was given to them to evacuate the native reserve immediately. In October 1850, a Commission of Enquiry was launched. The Basotho, under Paulus Mopeli‚Äôs leadership, refused to recognise the Commission, claiming it was made up of white men who were not acting impartially.Barnard, L; Stemmet, J; Semela, S (Pg 191).

The men did not show up and instead held their own gathering at Namoha village. As a result, Proclamation 28 of 1950 was issued by the government, deeming public gatherings of three or more people illegal. Police reinforcements, led by Major I.P.S. Terblanche, were deployed into Witziehoek with the intention of using violence to suppress the outcry and subpoena the four men.Barnard, L; Stemmet, J; Semela, S (Pg 193).

The constable's horse was struck with a stick by someone in the crowd; the animal reared and the constable fell. Shortly afterwards, Major Terblanche ordered his men to fire into the crowd. The first casualty was Sejeso Dhlamina. Thirteen other Basotho people were shot and killed. Two black police officers were struck down. Court verdict In December 1950, Native Affairs Minister Hendrik Verwoerd signed a proclamation that enabled the arrest of the main actors of the protracted dispute.\\"Resistance and banishment in Wietzehoek\\".

Accessed: 10 October 2018 By November 1951, the deadly standoff had been brought to trial: Justice De Beer handed down sentences of imprisonment and banishment to 79 Basotho men and women. 25 of those standing trial were discharged, while the six people identified as the main actors were sentenced to imprisonment with terms ranging from 18 months to five years. Eight people, including Paulus Howell Mopeli, were banished from Witzieshoek. Mopeli himself was sent to Johannesburg to serve a prison sentence, after which he served a banishment term in Middleburg. Despite accounts from multiple witnesses that Major Terblanche fired into the crowd without warning or provocation, the judge deemed the gathering of more than 300 men in the wake of all that occurred to be a sign of the Basotho's violent intentions.

The DF-17's hypersonic armament gives China significant leverage over current conventional ABM's due to the glide vehicle's unpredictable ballistic trajectory. The DF-17 along with the DF-ZF, was officially unveiled at the National Day military parade on 1 October 2019, making this China's first operational hypersonic weapon systems and one of the world's first to be put in full initial operation.Henri Kenhmann (2019-10-07) DF-17 : Ce que l‚Äôon sait de cette arme hypersonique chinoise (translated, French: DF-17: What is known about this Chinese hypersonic weapon) Design The DF-17 uses the rocket booster from the already operational DF-16B short-range ballistic missile. As such, the design of the missile itself did not require any major changes. The biggest change however, is the obvious usage of a hypersonic glide vehicle rather than a conventional re-entry warhead(s) found in normal ballistic missiles and MIRVs. The DF-ZF HGV operates in a different manner from normal ballistic missiles or even intercontinental ballistic missiles in the first place. Rather than firing and landing in a normal arc, the DF-17's HGV suppresses its trajectory and accelerates to reach Mach 5. Due to its extreme speed and suppressed/lower altitude trajectory, intercepting the glide vehicle with ABM shielding becomes far harder and more complex than that of a conventional re- entry vehicle. This is further complicated, as the gliding makes the DF-ZF far more maneuverable; Ankit Panda (October 07, 2019) Hypersonic Hype: Just How Big of a Deal Is China‚Äôs DF-17 Missile? A conventional-weapons-only boost- glide HGV mounted on endo-atmospheric fuselage extending both its range and avoiding potential ABM shielding. As such, the DF-17 could hit regional targets despite its SRBM nature. The DF-17 can also be used to mount a more conventional re-entry vehicle than the DF-ZF. Development Testing of DF-17 prototypes was underway by 2014. At least nine test flight occurred between January 2014 and November 2017. The HGV test flight of 1 November 2017 launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Inner Mongolia. The missile's payload flew approximately 1,400 kilometers with the HGV flying at a depressed altitude of around 60 kilometers following the completion of the DF-17‚Äôs ballistic and reentry phases. The test followed the first plenum of the Communist Party of China‚Äôs 19th Party Congress in October. The missile was officially unveiled during the National Day parade on 1 October 2019.

Although nominally allied with the German Empire and the Empire of Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance, the Kingdom of Italy did not join the Central Powers; in fact, Germany and Austria‚ÄìHungary had taken the offensive while the Triple Alliance was supposed to be a defensive alliance. Moreover, the Triple Alliance recognized that both Italy and Austria-Hungary were interested in the Balkans and required both to consult each other before changing the status quo and to provide compensation for whatever advantage in that area: Austria- Hungary did consult Germany but not Italy before issuing the ultimatum to Serbia, and refused any compensation before the end of the war. Italy negotiated for a better deal with the Allies, especially in terms of gaining territory from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, Russia had its own pro- Slavic interest in that region, and complicated negotiations. Russia's negotiating position was greatly weakened by its heavy military losses. London and Paris insisted and Russia, by April 1915, abandoned its support for most of Serbia's claims and accepted terms for Italy's entry into the war, which would limit the Russian strategic presence in the postwar Adriatic.Paul Du Quenoy, \\"With allies like these, who needs enemies?: Russia and the problem of Italian entry into World War I.\\" Canadian Slavonic Papers 45.3-4 (2003): 409-440.

Italy accepted the Allies‚Äô offer in which Italy would receive a slice of Austria and a slice of the Ottoman Empire after the defeat of Austria-Hungary. This was formalised by the Treaty of London. In 1915, Italy entered the war joining the Triple Entente (i.e. the Allies).C.J. Lowe, \\"Britain and Italian Intervention 1914-1915.\\" Historical Journal (1969) 12#3 533-548. Public and elite opinion was split on the wisdom of the war, for the nation was very poorly prepared, the army was not well trained, and there was too small an industrial and financial base. However, the country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the \\"Big Four\\" top Allied powers. A handful of leaders made the basic decisions, notably Prime Minister Antonio Salandra and especially the two foreign ministers Antonio di San Giuliano and Sidney Sonnino. They optimistically expected that victory would bring new territories and new glory, thus closing some of Italy's internal conflicts. Under the Peace Treaties of Saint-Germain, Rapallo and Rome, Italy gained a permanent seat in the League of Nations's executive council and obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except Zara), allowing nationalists to redefine the result as a \\"Mutilated victory\\"; that angry sentiment helped to the rise of the fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini in 1922.H. James Burgwyn, The legend of the mutilated victory: Italy, the Great War, and the Paris Peace Conference, 1915-1919 (Greenwood, 1993). Military alignments in 1914. When the war started Italy declared neutrality; in 1915 it switched and joined the Triple Entente (i.e. the Allies). Roy Pryce summarized the bitter experience: : The government's hope was that the war would be the culmination of Italy's struggle for national independence. Her new allies promised her the 'natural frontiers' which she had so long sought- the Trentino and Trieste-and something more. At the end of hostilities she did indeed extend her territory, but she came away from the peace conference dissatisfied with her reward for three and a half years' bitter warfare, having lost half a million of her noblest youth, with her economy impoverished and internal divisions more bitter than ever. That strife could not be resolved within the framework of the old parliamentary regime. The war that was to have been the climax of the Risorgimento produced the Fascist dictatorship. Something, somewhere, had gone wrong.Roy Pryce, \\"Italy and the Outbreak of the First World War.\\" Cambridge Historical Journal 11#2 (1954): 219-27 at p. 219. online. Leadership The Italian leadership was inexperienced, unfamiliar with international affairs, and often quite ill. Forces outside the government played minor roles. The business and financial communities wanted peace, but they were ignored in the decision-making. Likewise intellectuals and foreign policy experts, as well as nationalistic pressure groups, were ignored. The King had nominal power over war and peace, but he had severe psychiatric problems in 1914, and in any case he turned over all major issues to his cabinet. Prime Minister Antonio Salandra took office in March 1914, had little experience in foreign affairs, and had no talent or taste for statecraft. The decision for war was in the hands of Foreign Minister Antonio di San Giuliano, an experienced diplomat, cynical and cautious. He was in poor health and died in October 1914. He was replaced by Sidney Sonnino, who maneuvered to join the Allies primarily to gain territory. Tommaso Tittoni, the ambassador to France, was often consulted; he also pled for joining the Allies. Civilian politicians marginalized the generals; the chief of staff died on July 1, and he was finally replaced by General Luigi Cadorna in late July. Cadorna exaggerated the Italian Army's capabilities to the unsuspecting civilians, while working hard to remove its weaknesses. All of the leaders distrusted Austria, and were eager to take control of the Austrian province of Trentino-Alto-Adige in the Alps, and the Austrian city of Trieste. They all distrusted the Ottoman Empire, and were proud that Italy had recently seized control of the Ottoman holdings in Libya. Italy, Austria and Serbia were all contending for control of Albania.Richard F. Hamilton and Holger H. Herwig, Decisions for War, 1914-1917 (2004), pp 184‚Äì89.  Prelude to war  Italy was a formal member of the Triple Alliance, alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary. However it also maintained good relations with France and Russia. The other countries understood this duality, and did not expect Italy to join in the war in 1914. Its treaty obligations did not require it to join with Germany and Austria, and it saw very little to gain from doing so. Public opinion wanted peace, and the leadership in Rome realized how poorly prepared the nation was in contrast to the powerhouses at war. By late 1914, however, Prime Minister Antonio Salandra and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino decided that major territorial gains were possible by joining the Allies, and would help calm extremely serious internal dissension, by bringing glory to the victorious army, as well as satisfying popular feeling by freeing Italian-speaking territories from Austrian rule. There were also new patronage opportunities and political victories for the politicians. They planned to argue, plausibly, that these results would be the triumph it climax of \\"Risorgimento\\" (that is, Italian unification). In December 1914 Sonnino opened negotiations in Vienna, asking for territorial compensation in return for remaining neutral. These talks were designed to conceal the government's true intentions from the Italian public opinion, and from the countries at war. In March 1915 Sonnino began serious negotiations with London and France . The Treaty of London was signed on 26 April 1915 and Italy declared war against Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. Salandra boasted that the Pact of London was \\"the greatest, if not the first completely spontaneous act of foreign policy executed by Italy since the Risorgimento.\\"William A. Renzi, \\"Italy's neutrality and entrance into the Great War: a re-examination.\\" American Historical Review 73.5 (1968): 1414-1432. online From the standpoint of its erstwhile allies, Italy's recent success in occupying Libya as a result of the Italo-Turkish War had sparked tension with its Triple Alliance allies, who had been seeking closer relations with the Ottoman Empire. Germans reacted to Italy's aggression by singing anti-Italian songs. Italy's relations with France remained tense: France still felt betrayed by Italy's refusal to help in the Franco-Prussian War back in 1870. Italy's relations with Great Britain had been impaired by constant Italian demands for more recognition in the international stage following its occupation of Libya and its demands that other nations accept its spheres of influence in Eastern Africa and the Mediterranean Sea.Richard J. B. Bosworth, Italy and the Approach of the First World War (1983) pp 101-112. Italy and its colonial possessions in 1914. In the Mediterranean, Italy's relations with Greece were aggravated when Italy occupied the Greek-populated Dodecanese Islands, including Rhodes, from 1912 to 1914. These islands had been formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Italy and Greece were also in open rivalry over the desire to occupy Albania.Bosworth (1983), pp 112‚Äì114 King Victor Emmanuel III himself was uneasy about Italy pursuing distant colonial adventures and said that Italy should prepare to take back Italian-populated land from Austria-Hungary as the \\"completion of the Risorgimento\\".Bosworth (1983), p. 119 This idea put Italy at odds with Austria-Hungary. Freemasonry was an influential semi-secret force in Italian politics with a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, as well as among the leadership in parliament, public administration, and the army. The two main organization were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy. They had 25,000 members in 500 or more lodges. Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, public opinion, and the leading political parties in support of Italy's joining the war as an ally of France and Great Britain. In 1914-15 they temporarily dropped their traditional pacifistic rhetoric and adopted the objectives of the nationalists. Freemasonry had historically promoted cosmopolitan universal values, and by 1917 onwards they reverted to their internationalist stance and pressed for the creation of a League of Nations to promote a new post-war universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations.Fulvio Conti, \\"From Universalism to Nationalism: Italian Freemasonry and the Great War.\\" Journal of Modern Italian Studies 20.5 (2015): 640-662. Internal instability A major hindrance to Italy's decision on what to do about the war was the political instability throughout Italy in 1914. After the formation of the government of Prime Minister Salandra in March 1914, the government attempted to win the support of nationalists and moved to the political right.Martin Clark, Modern Italy: 1871‚Äì1982 (1984) p. 180 At the same time, the left became more repulsed by the government after the killing of three anti-militarist demonstrators in June. Many elements of the left including syndicalists, republicans and anarchists protested against this and the Italian Socialist Party declared a general strike in Italy.Clark, Modern Italy p. 180 The protests that ensued became known as \\"Red Week\\", as leftists rioted and various acts of civil disobedience occurred in major cities and small towns such as seizing railway stations, cutting telephone wires and burning tax- registers. However, only two days later the strike was officially called off, though the civil strife continued. Militarist nationalists and anti-militarist leftists fought on the streets until the Italian Royal Army forcefully restored calm after having used thousands of men to put down the various protesting forces. Following the invasion of Serbia by Austria-Hungary in 1914, World War I broke out as Germany and Austria stood opposed to Serbia, Russia, France and Britain. Despite Italy's official alliance to Germany and membership in the Triple Alliance, it remained neutral, claiming that the Triple Alliance was only for defensive purposes.Giordano Merlicco, \\"Italy and the Austro‚ÄêSerbian crisis of July 1914\\", in VVAA, Serbian‚ÄêItalian Relations: History and Modern Times, The Institute of History, Belgrade, 2015, pp. 121-35 Gabriele D'Annunzio, national poet (vate) of Italy was the voice of nationalist revolutionaries calling for joining the Allies Society was divided over the war: Italian socialists generally opposed the war and supported pacificism, while nationalists militantly supported the war. Long-time nationalists Gabriele D'Annunzio and Luigi Federzoni and a Marxist journalist once praised by Lenin, now a new convert to nationalist sentiment, Benito Mussolini, demanded that Italy join the war. For nationalists, Italy had to maintain its alliance with Germany and Austria in order to gain colonial territories at the expense of France. For the liberals, the war presented Italy a long-awaited opportunity to use an alliance with the Entente to gain territories from Austria-Hungary, which had long been part of Italian patriotic aims since unification. Luigi Federzoni emphasized the need to join the war and warned of continued disunity if it did not: Mussolini used his new newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia and his strong oratorical skills to urge nationalists and patriotic revolutionary leftists to join the Allies: \\"Enough of Libya, and on to Trento and Trieste\\".Thayer, Italy and the Great War. (1964). p 279) Mussolini argued that it was in the interests of all socialists to join the war to tear down the aristocratic Hohenzollern dynasty of Germany because it was the enemy of all European workers.Thayer, p. 272 Mussolini and other nationalists warned the Italian government that Italy must join the war or face revolution and called for violence against pacifists and neutralists.Thayer, p. 253 Left-wing nationalism also erupted in Southern Italy as socialist and nationalist Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida saw joining the war as essential to relieving southern Italy of the rising cost of bread which had caused riots in the south, and advocated a \\"war of revolution\\".Thayer, p. 254 A Bidding war: bargaining with both sides There was no good reason for Italy to risk the horrors and expenses of war ‚Äî it joined it for new territories that would make the government look good and dissolve the intense internal disharmony. The strategy was to bargain for the best possible offer in terms of both territorial gains and coverage of Italian financial and military weaknesses.C.J. Lowe, \\"Britain and Italian Intervention 1914-1915.\\" Historical Journal (1969) 12#3, pp. 533-48.Dennis Mack Smith, Italy: A Modern History (1969), pp. 292‚Äì305. By August 1914 Russia was eager for Italia's entry into the war, expecting it would open a new front that would paralyze any Austrian offensive. Russia had nothing to give Italy, so there were no results. Rome refused to make a commitment, and there was a pause when Foreign Minister San Giuliano died in October.Lowe, pp 534-36. His replacement Sonnino planned to join the winning side in order to gain new territory. At first he expected the Central Powers to win, but the war looked more like a long one, so it was not necessary to hurry and join in. Austria had too little to offer and was showing its military weakness. Berlin pressured Vienna to make more territorial concessions to Rome, but it was too little, too late as Sonnino turned to the Allies. They were more than willing to promise large territorial spoils taken from Austria and Turkey. Italy's very long coastline made it exposed to the vastly superior power of the Allied navies. Public opinion was divided and Sonnino used that to mislead the cabinet. By February 1915 he was negotiating with both sides, but had decided that the Allies were making the better offer. He ignored the poor state of the Italian military, expecting that Britain and France would do all the fighting that was necessary. The Italian treasury could not fund a war, but again there were promises of money and munitions from London and Paris.LoweMack Smith, pp 296-305. In April 1915 Italy signed the London Pact with Britain and France. The pact ensured Italy the right to attain all Italian-populated lands it wanted from Austria-Hungary, as well as concessions in the Balkan Peninsula and suitable compensation for any territory gained by the Allies from Germany in Africa. Italy declared war a month later and invaded Austria from the south. The reaction in Italy was divided: former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was furious over Italy's decision to go to war against its two long- time former allies. Giolitti claimed that Italy would fail in the war, predicting high numbers of mutinies, Austro-Hungarian occupation of even more Italian territory. He warned that the failure would produce a catastrophic rebellion that would destroy the liberal-democratic monarchy and the liberal- democratic secular institutions of the state. Sonnino made the decision and ignored Giolitti's dire predictions, which came horribly true.Clark, Modern Italy: 1871‚Äì1982. (1984) p. 184. One major result was that Italian nationalism was greatly strengthened and became a major force at both elite and popular levels until 1945, when popular democracy became a much more important force.Massimo Salvadori, \\"Nationalism in Modern Italy-1915 and after.\\" Orbis-A Journal of World Affairs 10.4 (1967): 1157-1175.

The plateau is bordered by the Hula Valley in the north, Sea of Galilee in the south, Mount Canaan to the west and by the Jordan River to the east. It is named after an ancient Jewish settlement also known as \\"Chorazin\\". The highest point is Filon Hill, which is 409 meters above sea level. Its borders vary between different definitions, spanning an area of between 80 km2 to 135 km2. The plateau is home to a few Israeli communities, including Rosh Pinna, Hatzor HaGlilit and the Bedouin town of Tuba-Zangariyye. The plateau's rural settlements make part of the regional councils of Upper Galilee, Mevo'ot HaHermon and Emek HaYarden. Several important archaeological and historical sites are located on the plateau, including Tel Hazor, Daughters of Jacob Bridge, Mount of Beatitudes and Jubb Yussef. Historically the plateau also served as a transit region for the valleys to the north and south, and the heights to the east and west. Armies passed through the plateau towards the Golan during the Palestine Campaign of World War I in 1918, the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war, Six Day War and Yom Kippur War. Geography 400px The Korazim Plateau is a distinct geographical region, that is not part of either of the regions that surround it.Stepansky, 2002, p.5 According to Yosef Stepansky of the Israel Antiquities Authority who made extensive research of the region, as well as Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, the borders of the plateau are the Hula Valley to the north, the Sea of Galilee to the south, the Jordan River to the east, which separates it from the Golan Heights, and to the west by Mount Canaan, as well as parts of the Safed Mountains. Stepansky measured the area of the plateau at 135 km2. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, which excludes the shore of the Sea of Galilee and the slopes of the mountains to the west, the area of the plateau is 117 km2. According to Mapa, which marks the northern border at the Mahanayim stream, the area of the plateau is only 80 km2. Geomorphology The term Korazim Plateau is used to define a geomorphological feature set between the Hula Basin and the Sea of Galilee. It is an elevated pressure-ridge within the Dead Sea Transform (DST) which acted as a barrier towards the waters of the Mediterranean when these flooded the lower-laying part of the DST, between what are now the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea basins, during the Pliocene transgression. The Korazim block as well as the higher elevation of the Hula Basin meant that the latter did not receive any marine water during that process. Geology Geologically, the plateau is divided into two main sections. The southern two- thirds are covered in layers of basalt. The basalt area falls from a height of 409 meters above sea level to 210 meters below sea level at the coast of the Sea of Galilee. The basalt is aged between 1.6 and 2.9 million years in the northern part as measured near Kfar HaNassi, and 3.5 to 5 million years in the lower part as measured near the village of Korazim. Some volcanic cones were found near Tel Ruman, Filon Hill and probably also in Tel Nes and Tel Ya'af. The origin of the young basalt is probably from these volcanic cones, but the older part of the basalt is part of a big layer of basalt which also covers the Golan Heights and southern Syria.Stepansky, 2008, p.271Stepansky, 2002, p.11 The basalt part of the plateau is very similar to the nearby Golan with its rocky landscape, the characters of the ancient settlements found there, as well as the abundance of dolmens found here. The northern third of the plateau is characterized by lower hills of limestone, conglomerate and some young basalt near Yarda. The height of this part ranges between 100 and 250 meters above sea level. On this area, the city of Hazor was established, which was an important city in ancient and biblical times. Some limestone layers can also be found in around the banks of the Jordan River (such as the area of the Daughters of Jacob Bridge). The plateau is bounded by faults to the east (the Jordan River Valley) and to the west (on the slopes of Mount Canaan). Other signs of fracture in the basalt indicate recent tectonic activity in the region, which may be the cause of the Galilee earthquake of 1837. Water Mahanayim River valley The rivers of the Korazim Plateau flow eastward to the Jordan River, and southward to the Sea of Galilee. The biggest river in the region is the Rosh Pinna River, which is 13 kilometer long and has a water basin of 40 square kilometers, which flows to the Jordan. Other rivers include the Mahanayim River and Tubim River, which flow to the Jordan as well, and the Korazim River, Or River and Koach River which flow to the Sea of Galilee. Next to these rivers, there are plenty of springs, around which plenty of ancient settlements existed.Stepansky, 2002, pp.12‚Äì13 History=Archaeology= During the 19th century, the Korazim Plateau, as well as the rest of the country, was surveyed by European explorers. French explorer Victor Gu√©rin and the PEF Survey of Palestine headed by Claude Reignier Conder and Herbert Kitchener described the various sites in the plateau. In the early 20th century the area was studied by German explorer Paul Karge and British archaeologist Francis Turville-Petre. During the late 20th century, Israeli and European archaeologists made extensive excavations in the major sites of Tel Hazor, Tel Kinrot and Daughters of Jacob Bridge, all on the edges of the plateau. In 1990 a systematic and extensive survey project began headed by Yosef Stepansky.Stepansky, 2008, p.271‚Äì272 Although the Korazim Plateau is considered a peripheral area, for the most part, it was a dense region where some 100 settlements existed. The rural basalt regions in the center and south of the plateau were inhabited by semi-nomadic people. The plateau also served as a transit region for the valleys to the north and south, and the heights to the east and west. =Chalcolithic period= The plateau was first settled extensively during the Chalcolithic period (4th millennium BCE). Over 25 settlements were established in that period in the plateau's basalt areas. These settlements resemble the Golan Heights, Hula Valley, and the Dalton Plateau's Chalcolithic cultures, with unique rectangular houses and pottery. =Bronze Age= Through the Early Bronze Age settlement continued to exist only in some of the Chalcolithic sites, and a few new sites were formed, mostly in the northern part of the plateau. During Early Bronze Age II (3000‚Äì2700 BCE) the city of Hazor was first established, while in the rest of the plateau there were between 10 and 15 settlements. In that period there was a growth in the settlements in the southern slopes of the plateau on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. As Hazor grew to be one of Canaan's largest and most influential cities, the settlements in the Korazim Plateau became its suburban area. During Early Bronze Age III (2700‚Äì2200 BCE), the city of Hazor grew to the size of an urban settlement with an area of between 100 and 150 dunams, while all of the plateaus settlements were depopulated. During Middle Bronze Age I (2200‚Äì2000 BCE), Hazor shrank to a small village, while in the plateau there was only one settlement in Khirbet Berech. In that period hundreds of megalithic tombs called \\"Dolmens\\" were built in the southern part of the plateau. During Middle Bronze Age II (2000‚Äì1550 BCE) the size of Hazor reached its peak as a metropolis of 800 to 1000 dunams. Some 15 to 20 small villages existed on the plateau during that period, most of which next to springs. In total their combined size was between 100 and 150 dunams. During the Late Bronze Age (1550‚Äì1200 BCE), the city of Hazor became smaller but still was the largest in Canaan at 700‚Äì800 dunams. Only two settlements existed in Tel Kinnarot and Kfar Nahum. =Iron Age= After the Late Bronze Age collapse and during Iron Age I (1200‚Äì1000 BCE) the city of Hazor was destroyed and replaced by a semi-nomadic settlement, while the settlement in the Korazim Plateau flourished, with 10 settlements with a combined area of 100 dunams and a city in Tel Kinnarot of 100 dunams alone. Between 1000 BCE and the Assyrian conquest in 733, Hazor became a royal center, while the settlement in the plateau increased with 20 settlements, some of which were fortified and they had a combined area of 200‚Äì250 dunams.Stepansky, 2008, pp.275‚Äì282 Modern settlement Because the soil is difficult to cultivate, and there is a lack of water sources, the number of settlements oin the Korazim Plateau is low. These are, from north to south: Ayelet HaShahar, Gadot, Mishmar HaYarden, Mahanayim, Hatzor HaGlilit, Kfar HaNassi, Rosh Pinna, Tuba-Zangariyye, Elifelet, Karkom, Ami'ad, Korazim, Almagor and Amnun. All of the settlements are Jewish and rural, except for the Muslim Bedouin town of Tuba-Zangariyye.

Fried also earned a master's degree in political campaigning from the University of Florida.Dan Sweeney, Where does Nikki Fried go from here?, South Florida Sun-Sentinel (November 22, 2018). Career After graduating in 2003, Fried worked at the law firm of Holland & Knight. She became a public defender for Florida's eighth judicial circuit in 2006, covering Alachua County and other counties. Fried was a foreclosure defense lawyer from 2009 until 2011, when she joined the law and lobbying firm of Colodny Fass. Fried worked as a lobbyist for many interests, including the school boards, foster children, and later the marijuana industry. Among her clients as a lobbyist were the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority, Walt Disney Co., Duke Energy, and HCA Healthcare. In 2016, Fried established her own lobbying firm; her main client was the School Board of Broward County.

Fried ran on a platform in favor of removing obstacles to medical marijuana in Florida, criticizing the state government's inaction in implementing the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative (Amendment 2), in which Florida voters approved the right of qualified patients to use marijuana.Nikki Fried, fellow Democratic candidates call for a state-run bank to manage medical cannabis funds, Orlando Weekly (October 30, 2018). Fried described herself as \\"a fierce advocate for expanding access to medical marijuana for suffering Floridians\\" and called for placing regulation of medical marijuana in the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services rather than the Department of Health.Jessica Weiss, Agriculture Commissioner Candidates Discuss Medical Marijuana, Guns, WLRN (October 19, 2018). Along with other Democratic candidates, Fried supported a state-run bank to provide financing for the marijuana industry, noting other banks' policies serving marijuana-related businesses. During her 2018 campaign, Fried also pledged to \\"ensure full background checks are completed on gun permits\\"; in Florida, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is charged with issuing concealed carry permits, and incumbent Commissioner Adam Putnam was criticized after it was revealed in 2018 that his office failed to complete background checks before issuing tens of thousands of permits. In fact,it was less than 300 which were revoked when the mistakes of 3 civil service employees were caught during an audit. Applications aren't handled directly by the Ag Commissioner. They are handled by state civil service employees working under an FDACS \\"bureau chief\\" over CCW licensing. Fried also pledged to \\"put science before politics and put our waterways first\\" if elected. Fried also endorsed Amendment 4, which would automatically restore voting rights for most felons after the completion of their sentences (see felon disenfranchisement in Florida). Fried was endorsed by the Tampa Bay Times, the Sun Sentinel,Nikki Fried offers ideas, Matt Caldwell offers the usual, in race for Florida Agriculture Commissioner, Sun-Sentinel (October 2, 2018). and the Palm Beach Post.Editorial: Fried offers fresh direction as Agriculture Commissioner, Palm Beach Post (October 1, 2018). Fried received the endorsements of the Everglades Trust, Sierra Club, Equality Florida, and Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, while Caldwell received the endorsements of business and industry groups, including the Florida Farm Bureau's political action committee, the Florida Chamber of Commerce and Associated Industries of Florida. Fried won an extremely tight election. While initial returns on Election Day showed Caldwell in the lead, by the completion of the count Fried narrowly pulled ahead with a margin of just 0.06% of votes separating the two candidates: Following a machine recount and a manual (hand) recount, Fried maintained and slightly expanded her lead, ultimately winning by 6,753 votes (0.08%). While Caldwell initially sued the Broward County supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes over the counting of ballots, Caldwell dropped the lawsuit and conceded defeat on November 19. Fried became the first Democrat to win the Commissioner of Agriculture position since 1998, the only Democrat to win a statewide race in Florida in 2018, and the first Democrat elected to a statewide executive position in Florida since Alex Sink served as Chief Financial Officer from 2007 to 2011. =Tenure= Fried opposed the United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement (USMCA), the 2019-20 free trade agreement that officially amended the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 2019 Fried crafted legislation with Democratic State Rep. Javier Fernandez targeting Florida gun laws. HB 809 would have required retention of fingerprint records, require proof of completion of firearms safety training for a license to be renewed, and reduced the term for a concealed-weapons permit from seven to five years. It did not pass the legislature in 2019. In 2020 Fried's office requested and was granted federal waivers to provide free meals to students despite schools being closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Almost 86% of the almost 287 million school lunches in the 2018-2019 Florida academic year were free or reduced lunches, serving 2.9 million students. The waivers and distributions are meant to make sure lower income students are not going hungry while schools remain closed. Fried was selected as one of seventeen speakers to jointly deliver the keynote address at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Controversies Shortly after entering office in 2019, Fried's office redesigned the Department of Agricultures certified gas-pump stickers, which verify to customers the gas pump has been approved by the state. Previous Agriculture Commissioners had put their own names on the stickers for decades, but Fried was the first to put a color photograph of herself smiling on the sticker. The decision sparked allegations by the Florida GOP, who accused Fried of using taxpayer funds to increase her political exposure. The Florida legislature quickly passed a law limiting the taxpayer-funded stickers to only ‚Äúa combination of lettering, numbering, words, or the department logo.‚Äù The stickers then began to be replaced with a new design that does not have her photograph. In August 2019 the department appointed two registered lobbyists for the Florida Sugar Cane League to consult on the Lake Okeechobee System Operating Manual Project Delivery Team, which was set to advise the United States Army Corps of Engineers on procedures for lake levels. Environmentalists have called for lake levels to be lowered to prevent harmful discharges, while the sugar industry has advocated for keeping levels high to avoid the threat of low water supply for farmers and municipalities. U.S. Congressman Brian Mast (FL-18) sent a letter to the Corps of Engineers seeking the lobbyists removal, alleging the appointments were an attempt to force sugar industry influence into the process. Seven Florida environmental groups, including Friends of the Everglades and Everglades Trust, called for the members to be removed and criticized their appointment. While Fried originally defended the appointments as expert consultants, she later fired their consulting firm and removed them from working on the project. In December 2019 Fried abstained from a cabinet vote on the nominee for state Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) Commissioner, in apparent contravention of Florida state law. Florida law states cabinet officials \\"may not abstain\\" from cabinet votes unless there is a conflict of interest. Fried said she had concerns over the transparency of the nomination and said her interpretation of the law did not mandate her to vote yes or no. Two experts contacted by the Tampa Bay Times found her argument legally \\"shaky\\" and contrary to the purpose of Florida's open government laws.

Horton (born 1949) is an American golf administrator who was inducted into the 2019 Tennessee Golf Hall of Fame. Horton served for 35 years as the executive director of both the Tennessee Golf Association (TGA) and the Tennessee Section PGA (Professional Golf Association of America) . He was one of the first fifteen full-time PGA Section executive directors in the U.S. and he gained national attention by bringing together golf's formerly competitive and often-contentious factions: professional golfers (PGA) and amateur golfers (TGA). He became executive director of both organizations and eventually was able to put all of the state's collective golf operations under one roof. Starting as a one-man operation in a bedroom office, he took the sport of golf in Tennessee from a largely structureless environment into the era of modern commercial golf. A skilled fundraiser, he secured enormous donations that allowed him to act on his ideas of the future for golf administration‚Äî he created a single golf complex called \\"Golf House Tennessee\\" which served to administer all golf activities in the state, including pro golf, amateur golf, women's golf, junior golf, and turfgrass research. It was the only facility of its kind at the time. Horton's success influenced other states to follow his blueprint. Tennessean sportswriter Joe Rexrode calls Horton \\"the Godfather of Tennessee Golf\\". Early life Horton was born in 1949 in Hamilton, New York, a small town that is the home of Colgate University, about 40 miles southeast of Syracuse. His father was a photographer who made composite photographs for college fraternities. His mother worked for Colgate, and this gave him access to the university's golf facilities. At age eight, Horton began playing at a nine-hole course owned by the university and later worked many summers at another university course called \\"Seven Oaks Golf Club\\", designed by Robert Trent Jones. Horton mowed and watered the course and sold golf balls he fished out of the lake. He played on his high school golf team and competed in several New York State junior championships. He attended Wake Forest University with hopes of playing college golf there, but failed to qualify as a walk-on. Horton graduated from Wake Forest cum laude in 1971 with a major in Latin. After obtaining a teaching certificate, he taught seventh and eighth graders and coached baseball in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He knew this was not what he wanted as a career. He got a golf-related job in junior golf for a while, but the Atlanta-based company went out of business; however, it was through that position that he heard about a golf administration job opening in Nashville. Career choice In 1973, at age 24 and with a Beatles haircut, Horton applied for a job in Tennessee as a golf administrator‚Äî an interview was scheduled. In preparation for the interview, Horton visited Jack Horner who had a similar job in North Carolina. Horner gave him some tips on what the job entailed along with an outline of what Horner had been hoping to accomplish. Later, at Horton's job interview, he found that the Tennessee PGA officials needed administrative help but were not exactly sure about what they wanted him to do, so Horton revealed a plan for the future based on his North Carolina visit. He spoke of adding a $4 fee to every pro-am entry fee, getting into the golf handicap business, and starting golf camps‚Äì ideas that no other candidate had. \\"When he left, we kind of looked at each other and said, 'I think we've got our man'\\", said Joe Taggert, selection committee member.\\" Other selection committee members were Willie Gibbons, Bill Hunt, Cotton Berrier, Bill Garner, and Hollis Morlow. After landing the job, Horton said, \\"They said there was [only] enough money to pay me for six months. I had those six months to somehow raise the other half of my salary.\\" That 1973 budget of $3,500 by the Tennessee PGA has grown to $22 million for the state's collective golf organizations in 2018. When hired for these positions in 1973, Horton was one of only 15 full-time PGA executive directors in the United States, but for Tennessee, he was the first paid employee. Taggart and Gibbons gave him some hand-me-down items, a mattress, and some dishes with a local country club logo. He rented an apartment and worked as a one-man office in a bedroom with the PGA paying for part of the rent. It took four years before Horton got an actual office. In 1993, Horton and his staff moved to the Legend's Golf Club in Franklin, Tennessee. In 1973, Horton met his future wife, Connie Prince, who was working at the pro shop at Nashville's Hillwood Country Club. They were married in December, 1974. Their daughter, Margaret, became a skilled player in her youth, and Horton admitted that having a daughter sparked his interest in his creating a girls' junior golf camp. Golf Administration It is well-known in the golf world that professional golfers and amateur golfers often have a contentious relationship. Sportswriter Joe Rexrode said, \\"... from what I can gather, it's like the Jets vs. Sharks while wielding pitching wedges\\". In the mid-1970s computers were just becoming widely used and Horton found that the PGA (professionals) and the TGA (amateurs) were in head-to head competition for the computerized golf handicap business, each negotiating with competing vendors. Horton helped convince the two factions to join forces, pick one vendor and divide the proceeds. The TGA golfers saw the early administrative success the PGA was having and inquired whether they might share Horton's services. With some concern over a previously strained relationship, the PGA agreed to \\"lease\\" his services to them. The final arrangement was to have the PGA technically be Horton's employer, but let the amateur TGA pay part of his salary and that Horton would have the title of \\"executive director\\" of both organizations. The existing TGA secretary/treasurer was told to surrender everything to Horton, including all the records and organization's bank account. Retired USGA official Larry Adamson said, \\"Some people just have people skills and Dick was honest, he was straight, he was able to look at both groups and tell them the benefits of being together.\\" As of 2002, Tennessee was one of only four U.S. states to have joint administration of pros and amateurs. This model has been copied by several other states and several have hired Horton's people to run them. Horton also persuaded the men's and women's amateur groups to unite. In 2000, the TGA(men) and WTGA (Women's Tennessee Golf Association) merged, making one governing body for amateur golf in the state. The trend continued in other states. Youth golf Horton was one of the first in the nation to organize youth summer golf camps which introduced many youngsters to the sport. The rise of skilled young players helped assure the sport's future popularity, identifying future golf champions and golf teachers. Junior golf in Tennessee came into being in 1974 when Dave Noble, the golf pro at Fall Creek Falls State Park in central Tennessee offered Horton the site to become the \\"PGA Junior Golf Academy\\", one of the nation's first. It had 98 boys the first year and Horton rented the cabins for them at the park. After 21 years there the golf academy was moved to new facilities. As of 2018, the junior golf program has had more than 15,000 graduates . Horton initiated other golf programs including a junior tour sponsored by PGA tour member Brandt Snedeker; a Ben Hogan Tour event; and the Nashville Golf Open Web.com Tour event. Snedeker himself was a youngster in Junior Golf and knew Horton then. Snedeker said, \\"We have a bunch of kids who are going to be on the (PGA and LPGA) tour because of the pipeline Dick started.\\" Golf House Tennessee Tennessee Golf Hall of Fame at Golf House Tennessee, Franklin, 2018In 1992, Horton visited Chattanooga philanthropist and Coca-Cola heir Jack Lupton with four bold requests: * land and a building to be a home for all golf operations in the state (Golf House Tennessee) * a new place for the Junior Golf Camp with a dormitory * a dedicated golf course, for the camp and for turfgrass research * a state golf hall of fame Lupton agreed and pledged $5 million, provided that the foundation would raise money from other sources that would start an endowment fund. Thus the Tennessee Golf Foundation, a non-profit, was incorporated in 1990 with Horton as president. A 15-acre tract with an ante- bellum home was purchased adjacent to the Vanderbilt Legends Golf Course in Franklin, Tennessee, near Nashville. The Vanderbilt Legends course, designed by Bob Cupp and Tom Kite, served as the Tennessee Golf Foundation's temporary headquarters while the land next door was being developed. The house and adjacent land was known as \\"Aspen Grove\\"‚Äî built in 1830s by Thomas McEwen who fought alongside Andrew Jackson in the Indian wars. Expanded and restored, it was named \\"Golf House Tennessee\\" and became the 21,000 square foot centerpiece of all golf operations in the state and opened in April, 1995. As of 1995, Golf House Tennessee was the only facility of its kind. The original structure now houses the Tennessee Golf Hall of Fame. The added administrative center, named for Horton, also contains the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, the Volunteer Chapter Club Managers Association of America, and the Women's TGA (WTGA) among others. Golf architect Bob Cupp was told to design a par-three course adjoining the Golf House. The first design did not suit benefactor Jack Lupton, who wanted the course to \\"require use of every club in the bag\\". Cupp went back to lengthen one hole to 226 yards (thus requiring a Driver), and to make double greens (one green serving two golf holes) to accommodate Lupton's request. The course was named \\"the Little Course at Aspen Grove\\". A 64-bed dormitory was built nearby to house the Junior Golf Camp attendees. Musician Vince Gill is another key player in the success of this endeavor. Gill, a scratch golfer, began hosting an annual golf tournament in 1993 known as \\"The Vinny Pro-Celebrity Golf Invitational\\" whose primary beneficiary is the Tennessee Golf Foundation. This tournament has raised over $8 million for Junior Golf to pay for staffing of the golf academy and for \\"The First Tee\\" projects and the Vince Gill Junior Tour. Gill received the PGA Distinguished Service Award in 2003, the PGA's highest honor. Other endeavors Lupton invited Horton to serve with him on the board of the \\"Arnold Palmer Golf Company\\". Horton saw it as a possible conflict of interest, but received permission from his other golf endeavors and took the position. He served for 5 years and said it was an unforgettable experience to sit on quarterly board meetings with Arnold Palmer and Nancy Lopez. Over the years he has been recruited to work for other states (California, Florida), or be director of the inaugural Ben Hogan Tour (later known as the Nike Tour) all of which he declined. He is a member of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, Scotland and was president of the International Association of Golf Administrators. Horton retired in 2018, after 45 years of golf administration.

Giedroyƒá did not have any great accomplishments, but his life followed Devotio Moderna, a movement calling for genuine pious practices such as humility, obedience, and simplicity of life. Giedroyƒá was born to nobles in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. One of his feet was paralyzed and he had to use crutches when walking. He later became a religious in the Canons Regular of the Penitence of the Blessed Martyrs, an Augustinian order. In 1460, he moved to Krak√≥w, Kingdom of Poland, where he received a university degree and remained until his death. He lived an austere life as a hermit in a hut attached to the where he served as a sacristan. He practiced self-flagellation. He was said to have received a vision from Jesus Christ and to have the gift of prophesy. His cause for canonization was launched sometime after his death and his relics were raised and enshrined in 1624. However, the beatification stalled and was abandoned in the 17th century. The cause was revived in the 1980s and in 2001 he was recognized as a Servant of God. On 7 November 2018, Pope Francis authorized equipollent beatification upon him due to recognition of his longstanding local cultus (veneration). Life Micha≈Ç Giedroyƒá was born around 1420‚Äì1425 to the princely Giedroyƒá family of Lithuanian nobles. His place of birth is usually indicated as Giedraiƒçiai, but some researchers suggest it could be Videni≈°kiai. His year of birth is estimated based on his signature witnessing a donation by the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family to the Franciscans in Vilnius in 1439 ‚Äì i.e. he had to be at least 15-years old. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was officially converted to Catholicism only in 1387, making Giedroyƒá only the second generation to be baptized. He suffered from frail health including lower than average height. A childhood accident left one of his feet paralyzed and he had to use crutches. Later examination of his remains revealed one of his legs was much shorter than the other. His disability likely influenced his later hermit tendencies and his devotion to crucified Christ. He did not want to be a burden and wanted to serve others. Therefore, he started making likely wooden boxes for the Eucharist that could be bought to the sick in their homes. Painting of Giedroyƒá from Videni≈°kiai with silver plated riza from mid-18th century He joined the Canons Regular of the Penitence of the Blessed Martyrs, an Augustinian order that had a convent in in present-day Belarus. They wore a white robe with a symbol of a red heart in front and thus were known as the White Augustinians. In 1460, together with the general superior of an Augustinian monastery and several other novices, he left for Krak√≥w and the following year enrolled into the Jagiellonian University. He studied the liberal arts and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1465. However, Lithuanian researcher argued that the university records related to a different person as his early hagiographies (written by university professors) mentioned nothing about his university education and student lists were publicized by Albert Wijuk Koja≈Çowicz in 1650. He became close friends with the and also knew fellow Augustinian . His contemporaries in Krak√≥w included John Cantius, Stanis≈Çaw Kazimierczyk, Szymon of Lipnica, and Ladislas of Gielni√≥w. The group was said to bring Felix saeculum Cracoviae (the happy age of Krakow). After his studies, Giedroyƒá became a sacristan at the . He received permission from his superiors to live as a hermit in a tiny hut attached to the church. He was not ordained to the priesthood and remained a religious brother helping clean, maintain, and decorate the church. He lived a reclusive and austere life and practiced mortifications and self- flagellation. Attracted by his charism, people started seeking out Giedroyƒá for his advice and prayer as they believed that he could prophesy. He ate poorly, refusing meat and often fasting on bread and salt alone. He most frequently prayed to the crucifix and image of the Madonna. The image of the Madonna is now known as the Madonna Giedroyciowa or Matka Boska Giedroyciowa. His prayers to Christ were so intense that he is said to have received a vision and heard Christ speak from the cross. According to a latter tradition, Christ spoke the words from the Revelation 2: Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. The crucifix now hangs in the main altar of the church. Giedroyƒá died in 1485 and his remains were interred in the Church of Saint Mark. He was buried in the presbytery, on the left to the main altar. According to his hagiography, the message to bury him in such a prominent place was delivered by . Veneration and miracles Painting of Giedroyƒá's vision with twelve scenes from his life and of other miracles The first mention of Giedroyƒá and his pious life comes from Chronica Polonorum written by Maciej Miechowita in 1519. A complete hagiography was written by , a professor at the Jagiellonian University, in 1544. Published in 1605 in Latin and in 1615 in Polish, it remains the main source of information on Giedroyƒá's life. There is evidence that there was an earlier manuscript written right after Giedroyƒá's death but it was burned in a church fire in 1494 or 1520. His grave was first opened in 1521 and his remains were found in good condition. The first known votive painting is from 1521. It was gifted by a city resident in gratitude for reviving her stillborn child and depicted the miracle. In 1614‚Äì1615, five soldiers of the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War (1605‚Äì1618) left votive paintings in gratitude for surviving the war. Researchers count five published biographies of Giedroyƒá in the 17th century, eight in the 18th century, and fourteen in the 19th century. His tomb was reopened again on 4 June 1624 and his relics were translated to a new sarcophagus suitable for public veneration on 11 August 1625. A late Renaissance tomb which survives to this day was built at the same time. In 1624, a large painting was completed depicting key scenes from Giedroyƒá's life. The central part depicts the key miracle ‚Äì the message from the crucified Jesus. In a window behind him, there are burning houses and people rushing away ‚Äì a reference to the tradition confirmed by Miechowita that Giedroyƒá was an effective patron from fires. Twelve smaller scenes illustrate episodes from his life on the left and miracles attributed to him on the right. These episodes include the miraculous rescue of the church of St. Mark from a fire, satanic torture that Giedroyƒá experienced during his prayers, prophesying to city residents. His posthumous miracles include the message delivered by ≈öwiƒôtos≈Çaw MilczƒÖcy regarding the proper burial place for Giedroyƒá, healing Katarzyna Rybarka (she was a possessed woman and it was the first recorded posthumous miracle attributed to Giedroyƒá), saving two young boys from drowning (a son of a Hungarian merchant who drowned in the Danube and a boy in the village of Spytkowice), and reviving a stillborn child. At the bottom, there are portraits of six other holy men who were Giedroyƒá's contemporaries in Krak√≥w. His cult continued to center in Poland and particularly Krak√≥w, but also spread to Lithuania in the 17‚Äì18th centuries. Paintings of him can be found in churches of Videni≈°kiai, Giedraiƒçiai, and Tvereƒçius. His paintings were mentioned in church records but do not survive in Veliuona, J≈´≈æintai, and Papilys. The church in Videni≈°kiai was founded by his relatives, voivode and bishop Merkelis Giedraitis. In 1617, Martynas Marcelis also founded a monastery of the Canons Regular of the Penitence in Videni≈°kiai. The painting of Giedroyƒá originally hung in a chapel-mausoleum where members of the Giedroyƒá family were interned. In September 2019, a relic of Giedroyƒá was solemnly installed in the , by Archbishop Gintaras Gru≈°as. Beatification Faelix Saeculum Cracoviae: holy men who lived in Krak√≥w in the 15th century. Giedroyƒá is on the left Giedroyƒá's burial in the presbytery might be an indication of plans for his beatification already at the time of his death. However, the Protestant Reformation attacked the cult of saints and there were no new canonizations between 1523 and 1588. Cardinal Jerzy Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (1556‚Äì1600) investigated the possibility of his canonization. The 1620s saw a surge in his veneration, but Pope Urban VIII issued a decree in March 1625 that codified rules of beatification and restricted certain signs of veneration or holiness (e.g. depiction of haloes) only to those who were officially beatified or canonized. In 1634, the pope further removed bishops' right to beatify people and reserved it to the pope. It is likely that Giedroyƒá's beatification efforts were abandoned because of these new rules. His congregation, the Canons Regular of the Penitence, declined and was suppressed by the authorities of the Russian Empire in 1832. The cult of Giedroyƒá was revived in 1980s largely due to efforts of Wac≈Çaw ≈öwierzawski who became rector of St. Mark's in 1968. He organized a small sanctuary known as Giedroycianum and regular Masses in Giedroyƒá's honor. The sanctuary consists of three rooms: the Hall of Roots with memorabilia of the Canons Regular of the Penitence, the White Room with a Gothic and Renaissance triptych from 1520 which depicts Giedroyƒá with Casimir Jagiellon before the Mother of God, and a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Giedroyƒá (Matka Boska Giedroyciowa). The 500th anniversary of Giedroyƒá's death in 1985 was marked with a large ceremony presided by Cardinal J√≥zef Glemp at the St. Mary's Basilica, Krak√≥w. Pope John Paul II sent a letter supporting renewed interest in Giedroyƒá. His beatification case was re-launched by Cardinal Franciszek Macharski alongside fellow Cardinals J√≥zef Glemp and Henryk Gulbinowicz. The Krak√≥w Archdiocese closed the diocesan stage on 24 April 1998. Giedroyƒá became a Servant of God on 27 July 2001 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (CCS) issued the nihil obstat (no objections) decree which meant the beatification cause could go ahead. In 2017, the postulation submitted the positio dossier to the CCS for further assessment. On 7 November 2018, Pope Francis beatified him and authorized the CCS to promulgate the decree on his heroic virtues and on the confirmation of his cult since time immemorial (i.e. equipollent beatification which is used when a canonical process is not possible due to the lack of sufficient historical sources).

Institute of Zoology at Ilia State University  History  The cave was discovered and studied by Georgian speleologists (consisted of the leader Mr. Jumber Jishkariani and the members: Tamaz Kobulashvili, Amiran Jamrishvili, Vakhtang Kapanadze, Kote Nizharadze) in the early 1980s. It is part of a large cave system, united by one underground river. Currently, about 30 km of the river has been investigated, which is about half the length of the entire cave system. In 1985 the conversion of the cave into a sightseeing tourist destination began. By 1989, a pedestrian route was laid in the cave for about 1 kilometer, stairs and paths were built, and a 150-meter tunnel was punched out at the exit and the construction of ground-floor buildings began. The cave was equipped with temporary lighting, and small groups of tourists started to visit. In 1990, due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and a lack of funds, the project was closed. For several years a local citizen protected the cave from vandals, as memorialized by a statue of him and his dog at the cave's entrance. In 2007, 17 years after the closure of the project, the Georgian authorities returned to the idea of the conversion of the cave into a tourist destination once again. President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili, who visited cave in 2010, gave an impetus to cave transformation into a tourist object, and suggested new name ‚Äî Prometheus Cave, since the legendary antique protagonist Prometheus was chained to the mountains approximately in this area. ( Local legend makes Prometheus enchained to the bluffs of Khvamli, being perpetually tortured by a raven.Comments of Association Green Alternative and CEE Bankwatch Network on Namakhvani HPP Cascade Project Draft Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Report dated April 2011.

He became internationally known for his hip house music.  Biography  Tony Scott is a Kalina Amerindian who was born in Moiwana, Suriname. He immigrated with his parents to Amsterdam, Netherlands at a young age. As a thirteen-year-old, he became a member of an electric boogie crew, followed by joining the beatboxing group 2-Tuff E-nuff. After he had rapped in a jingle for the radio station where his brother was working, the 16-year-old Scott was offered a contract by the owner of the Dutch record label Rhythm. His first single that was released was \\"Pick Up the Pieces\\", a remake cover of the Average White Band song. Even though the single did not become a commercial success, it ensured that he could perform a lot. In 1989, he released his next single, a double A-side with the songs \\"That's How I'm Living\\" and \\"The Chief\\". The latter song was written as an ode to his indigenous Kalina heritage. The single was a success in the Netherlands, but also received attention in the United Kingdom and the United States. In the same year, he released his first album The Chief, with his regular producer Fabian Lenssen. The album was released as That's How I'm Living in the United States, because he was better known for that song with the same name. It contained twelve hip house/hardcore rap tracks. In 1990, Scott released the single \\"Get Into It\\", which became his most successful song. He was invited to perform at the New Music Seminar in New York. Even before his trip to this music fair, the rapper had another hit, \\"Gangster Boogie\\". In the same year, he released the single \\"Move to the Big Band\\" with Ben Liebrand. Afterwards, Scott released several singles and changed his sound numerous times, but none of his products equaled the success of the first few singles. In 1991, he released his second album Expressions from the Soul and his third album Chameleon was released in 1993. In 1994, Scott and Fabian Lenssen wrote the single \\"Gangsterdam\\" for the Dutch children's choir Kinderen voor Kinderen. In 1996, he released a theme song for the American football team Amsterdam Admirals. In 2000, Scott became a music teacher in Amsterdam.

She is currently Dean of the College of Earth, Ocean and Environment at the University of Delaware. She is also an adjunct professor at both the University of Waterloo and the Missouri University of Science and Technology. Before joining the University of Delaware in 2017, she was the Department Head of the Boone Pickens School of Geology at Oklahoma State University. She is a Regents Distinguished Professor and a Clyde Wheeler Sun Endowed Chair at Oklahoma State University, where she maintains an adjunct appointment. Atekwana has also been a faculty member at Missouri University of Science & Technology, Indiana University- Purdue University Indianapolis, and Western Michigan University.  Biography  Atekwana grew up in Cameroon and obtained her B.S. in Geology from Howard University in 1983 as a first-generation college student. At Howard University, Atekwana started in a pre-med program before switching to a geology major. She credits a teacher in the 1970s for inspiring her to pursue geology when they said that girls weren't suited for field work. She set out to prove the teacher wrong. After earning her B.S., Atekwana completed an M.S. in geology, also at Howard University in 1986. In 1991, Atekwana completed a Ph.D. in Geophysics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. After completing graduate school, she became an assistant professor at Western Michigan University. On a sabbatical in 1999 Atekwaka was a visiting professor at the University of Botswana. After leaving Western Michigan University in 2003 she taught at Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis and Missouri University of Science and Technology before starting at Oklahoma State University's Boone Pickens School of Geology in 2007. Atekwana's efforts in diversity in the geosciences and capacity building in developing countries have been recognized with outstanding educator awards from both the Association for Women Geoscientists and the Society of Exploration Geophysicists. She serves on numerous professional committees including the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Honors and Awards committee and the U.S. National Committee for the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).  Research interests  Atekwana is a pioneer in the multidisciplinary field of Biogeophysics, which uses geophysics to understand the biogeochemical interactions occurring at contaminated sites. Atekwana's biogeophysical research investigates the effects of microbial-mediated processes on geological media. Some of her research evaluates the utility and resolution of in situ resistivity measurements combined with surface geoelectrical measurements to map contaminant distribution in the subsurface. Atekwana also uses the geoelectric and geophysical signatures of contaminated sites to investigate relationships between biological processes and their impact on electrical properties of geologic material. Atekwana also uses geophysics to investigate tectonic processes. Her geophysical studies reveal crust and upper mantle structures that inform the geodynamic processes associated with incipient rifting of continental crust. For example, Atekwana and colleagues show how geophysically imaged pre-existing basement structures in Malawi and Botswana influenced strain localization during early rifting. Another case study from the nascent Okavango rift in northwest Botswana provides evidence that pre-existing basement structures control rifting. Atekwana is also involved in a project to use smartphones with geophysical sensors to potentially provide a more affordable approach to the acquisition of geophysical data, highlighting the application at academic institutions with limited access to expensive geophysical equipment.

Career  Moses started his professional career as a trained accountant in Uganda‚Äôs capital, Kampala, and worked in that role for three years from 2006 to 2009. He left that career in 2009, after visiting his family in the countryside in Western Uganda and meeting his 12-year old sister: she had to travel 10 km on foot to purchase firewood for the family instead of attending school. At that point, Moses decided to invest all his life savings ($500) in the creation of an affordable alternative to wood-based fuel. In 2010 he launched EFA and produced the first kilns and briquette machines. EFA is a social enterprise selling clean-fuel to approximately twenty thousand families in Uganda and employing 120 people. The EFA business model created revenue for hundreds of local women retailers, who sell clean cooking charcoal (biochar) briquettes, and for thousands of farmers suppliers, who produce biochar from agricultural waste employing EFA's kilns technology. Moses worked with engineers to develop kilns and briquetting machines to produce affordable biochar. He aims to make this technology available to other sub-Saharan rural populations with a similar lack of affordable, clean bio-fuel. Moses has established that EFA's environmental policy include the reinvestment of part of its profits in Uganda reforestation.

Elected from among those among the Venetian patriciate who already had some naval experience, the sopracomito was an important position and stepping- stone in the naval cursus honorum of the Republic of Venice. It entailed considerable responsibilities for crewing and maintaining a galley as well as great expenses, which made it increasingly the province of the wealthier patricians. Eligibility and selection Like all naval officers, the sopracomiti were always chosen from among the Venetian patriciate; while the right of election of some naval officers passed to the Venetian Senate in the 18th century, the sopracomiti of the galleys continued to be selected by the Great Council of Venice. Only in the case of the bastard galleys that were used as flagships (generalizie) by the squadron commanders (the Capi di Mare) was the selection of the captain (termed a governatore or direttore) in the hands of the respective commander. Galleys equipped by the cities subject to Venice were commanded by nobles from these cities, which often led to friction with the Venetian patricians. Election to the post required a minimum of four years' prior service as a nobile (patrician cadet officer) on a galley (to avoid nepotism, sons of a sopracomito were prohibited from serving on the ship of their father). Apart from rare exceptions, patricians were not appointed to the post before their 20th year. In turn, the post of sopracomito served as a stepping-stone for higher commands; to be eligible for them, a sopracomito had to have actively served at least four years as captain of a galley. Duties and responsibilities The appointment typically lasted from 3 to 5 years. However, election as a sopracomito did not automatically mean command of a galley; years might pass before a sopracomito was appointed to command, allowing a galley from the Venetian Arsenal to be put at his disposal, and for money for hiring a crew made available. The responsibility of recruiting a crew was in the hands of the sopracomito, who with his paymaster set up a bench on the Molo in front of the Doges' Palace to attract crewmen (galeotti). In order to recruit a good crew, a sopracomito eager to distinguish himself often had to provide bonuses from his own pocket, hoping to be reimbursed by the government later. Furthermore, while the government provided allotments of hardtack, all other expenses for feeding the crew and maintaining the ship had to be paid by the sopracomito, to be later‚Äîoften with considerable delay, up to a few years‚Äîreimbursed by the government. A monthly stipend (sovenzion) was provided by the government, but often this could only be claimed at the end of the campaign season, after the galley had returned to its home port to be demobilized. As a result, only the wealthier patricians could afford to become sopracomiti, and sometimes wealthy families were deliberately selected by the government for that purpose, although cases are known where sopracomiti tried to use the post for their own financial gain, by imposing loans on their crews and pocketing government money while claiming inflated expenses for their ship. Originally, selection for the post could not be refused by the candidate, particularly at wartime, but the exorbitant expenses made it an onerous duty that many tried to avoid. By 1686, refusal to serve was accepted against a fine of 500 Venetian ducats. In 1696, the penalty for refusal during wartime was sharpened further by deprivation of the right to sit in the Great Council for the duration of the conflict. Because the crew represented a considerable investment, captains were sometimes reluctant to risk them in battle; after the defeat at the Battle of the Oinousses Islands in 1695, a special commission considered that reluctance, as well as the scarcity of wages for crews, as the main reasons for the defeat. Because of this, the last centuries of the Republic increasingly saw the phenomenon of patricians (as well as foreigners) serving as \\"mercenaries\\" (venturieri) in various positions, including that of sopracomito. When in active service, the sopracomito was obliged to always remain on board his ship, and was prohibited from bringing along his family or even having an accommodation on land. Likewise, severe restrictions were placed on the luxuries permitted a sopracomito, such as a ban on gilding, engravings, or silk furnishings on the ship. Nevertheless, the frequency with which the Venetian Senate issued instructions on the matter points to widespread violation of these regulations in practice. On the return, the sopracomito had to report to the board of the Provveditori all'Armar, officials responsible for the supply of the fleet, to account for the number of his crew, and claim the sovenzione due; if he failed to do this within fifteen days, he was barred from participating in the deliberations of the Great Council.

She provided art for many different publishers, including Ace Magazines, Fiction House, and Atlas Comics (later to become Marvel Comics). Brewster is most notable for illustrating romance comics. After a career as penciller and inker for comics, she transitioned to illustrating novels and children's magazines before retiring in 1980.  Personal life  Ann Brewster was born Shirley Sonya Zweifach to Abraham Marks Zweifach and Anna Silverman on November 20, 1918. She spent part of her life in the Bronx borough of New York City before moving to Mount Vernon, New York in 1927. After graduating from Lincoln Elementary School of Mount Vernon, Brewster developed an interest in fashion design while a student at the Wilson Junior High School of Mount Vernon. Though she originally pursued a career in fashion design, her time at the Cooper Union Art School ultimately led to a career in illustration. Her career spanned from 1941 to 1980. She never married nor had children. Ann Brewster died on July 9, 2005 in New York City. = Family influence = Brewster's father, Abraham, owned a women's coats manufacturing factory. Brewster's brother, Ira Stanley Zweifach, collected rare books. He was also interested in the publishing industry. Ira went on to become a magazine photographer, followed by a career in publishing.  Career  Ann Brewster spent forty years as an artist for comic books, magazines, and novels. = Comics = Throughout her career as a cartoonist, Brewster worked on many different comics for a variety of publishing houses. Her career began in Jack Binder's \\"Binder Comic Shop\\" in 1941. The Binder Comic Shop was responsible for supplying artwork to comic book publishers. It was while working at Binder Comic Shop where Brewster received her first credit as an artist in Samar for Quality Comics in 1941. In March 1942, Brewster created her first comic art for Fiction House's Sheena comics. She was the artist for 15 Sheena comics between 1942 and 1946. Young Romance #1 (1947) by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby: The first romance comic In 1944, Brewster joined Jerry Iger's S. M. Iger Studio. The Iger Studio supplied work for larger publishing houses like Quality Comics, Holyoke and Gilberton. During this World War II era, Iger hired many female artists, including Brewster, which led to an influx of female characters written and drawn by female artists. While working for Iger, Brewster created art for Bulletman and Mr. Scarlet comics published by Fawcett. Bulletman and Mr. Scarlet were both superhero comics published during the Golden Age of comic books. Shortly after, Brewster became an inker on several more comics: Blackstone for Street & Smith, Rip Carson for Fiction House, and The Hawk, also published by Fiction House. She also created the art for issue #9 of Kitty Kelly Yankee Girl, wartime heroine. While part of the Iger Studio, Brewster was the artist for Gilberton's Classics Illustrated series. She worked with Robert Hayward Webb to produce the issue retelling Frankenstein by Mary Shelly, which was adapted for comics by Ruth A. Roche. Brewster moved on to Ace Magazines in 1948. This comic book publisher's longest running series are made up of the romance comics created under their imprint Ace Periodicals. Among these lasting titles, Ann Brewster created art for Glamorous Romances, Love at First Sight, Love Experiences, and Real Love. In her seven years at Ace (1948-1955), Brewster was the artist behind 59 issues of Ace's romance comics. In 1955, she was featured as the artist for several Young Romance comics. Young Romance, originally created by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon in 1947, is credited as the first romance comic. Brewster's art was used to create a number of covers for Kirby and Simon through the Prize Group, an imprint of Feature Publications, including Young Romance #77 and #79. The 1950s was also spent creating comics for Timely/Atlas Comics romances. Between September 1949 and July 1958, Brewster was the artist for 74 issues of Atlas, now Marvel, Comics. Some of these titles include Love Tales and My Own Romance. In addition to romance, Brewster dabbled in Atlas' other genres, including sci-fi/horror comic Journey Into Mystery and crime drama All-True Crime Cases. Journey into Mystery would become an important comic to Atlas, as it later introduces the Norse mythological god turned superhero, Thor. Brewster's comic art for \\"Foster's Fate!\\", part of Journey Into Mystery Issue #25, was reprinted in 2010 for Marvel Masterworks: Atlas Era Journey Into Mystery #3, both the Regular and Limited Variant Edition. Brewster's final collection of comic publications was for Gilberton's The World Around Us series in 1961. = Other publications = The last two decades of Brewster's career featured her as an illustrator for various novels and magazines. Bible Stories to Read Aloud (1962), curated by Oscar Weigle, was Brewster's first children's novel illustration. Brewster also illustrated Animal Atlas of the World (1969) written by E.L. Jordan and published by the Hammond Map Company and The Dell Encyclopedia of Dogs (1974) distributed by Delacorte Press. Silver Wolf (1973) by Paige Dixon has a cover and illustrations by Brewster. Humpty Dumpty's Magazine for Little Children featured \\"The Nighthawks\\" by Helen Hoover and \\"The Nest Builders\\" by Hal Borland, both illustrated by Ann Brewster. What is a Mammal? (1975) published by Golden Look-Look Books and written by Jennifer W. Day was illustrated by Brewster as well. Brewster retired from artistry in 1980. = Critical reception = World War II called for women to enter the job force and resulted in an increase of women in the comic book industry. The art of romance comics was often stylish and elegant. Women artists drew graceful, dramatic portrayals and close-ups of a woman's face. Among these artists was Ann Brewster. Ann Brewster contributed to 36 comics for Fiction House, most while an artist for Jerry Iger's studio. Fiction House was more inclined to publishing comics about heroic women who are both strong in character and depicted in the popular \\"good girl\\" art style. The Iger Studio became synonymous with this \\"Good Girl Art\\", and Brewster's work depicted that of the sexy heroine. Brewster's work for Fiction House includes art for: Jane Martin, The Hawk, Rip Carson, Sheena, and ZX-5 Spies in Action. In his novel commenting on the Classics Illustrated series, William B. Jones, Jr. regarded Brewster's work in various Gilberton comics as clean yet detailed. The 1973 New York Times article \\"Wolves Named Silver\\" comments on Brewster's work in Paige Dixon's Silver Wolf. The article discusses the wolf's rise in popularity and pop culture, including reviews of three novels published for young readers. Writer Jean Craighead George describes Silver Wolf as a dramatic rise-to-power adventure story featuring the clean-lined illustrations of Ann Brewster. In his 1974 issue of Who's Who of American Comics, historian Hames Ware recorded artist Lou Cameron's account of Ann Brewster and her work. Cameron said that Brewster was hard working, dedicated, and faithful to her art. He described her style as being similar to \\"Hollywood actress Ann Miller ... if she had shopped at Klein's and if she wore her hair like ten years out of style\\". Cameron continues on to mention that Brewster was considered an excellent children's novel illustrator. The Who's Who of American Comics was a four part publication created in collaboration with Jerry Bails. Columbia University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library now houses the notes curated by Ware in his efforts to record the biographies of various artists.  Notable works =Frankenstein (1945)= Classic Comics No. 26: Frankenstein cover art and illustrations by Ann Brewster and Robert Hayward WebbGilberton reprinted Frankenstein for Classics Illustrated nineteen times between 1945 and 1971. The cover was redesigned and repainted by artist Norman Saunders in 1957. The interior remained unchanged. The comic was originally printed under Classic Comics, but the title changed to Classics Illustrated in March 1947. Comic book writer Donald F. Glut identified Brewster's and Webb's adaptation of Frankenstein's monster as having dark gray coloring and bare feet to differentiate from Boris Karloff's version of the monster. Glut also notes that Brewster and Webb dressed the characters in clothing more closely related to the Regency style of the early 19th century, as opposed to remaining true to the original novel's 18th century style.

The women are always in charge and unafraid of conflict, never in need of a rescuer. Sheena, Queen of the Jungle quickly became Fiction House's lead heroine and is credited as the first female super-heroine with her own titular comic. Though considered an important milestone for women in comics, Sheena's character is also largely problematic for her depictions of nonwhite characters. More recent versions of the character aim to rectify the character's past by avoiding the \\"jungle girl\\" stereotypes and focusing on environmental issues. Brewster was a featured artist in 15 issues of Sheena, the most she contributed for any one comic book title.

Both islands are the above water limestone \\"caps\\" of now inactive volcanoes. The two islands are the surface features of the undersea Barbuda Bank and have karst limestone landscapes. Barbuda is primarily flat and formed from coral reefs. The Middle Miocene Highlands Formation has limestones which are the oldest rocks on the island, rising 120 feet above sea level. The Beazer Formation and the Codrington Formation are both from the Pleistocene and include reef and lagoon related rocks. The geologic record of Antigua indicates a transition from island arc volcanism to limestone deposition in the Late Oligocene. Hence the island is characterized by a Basal Volcanic Suite (BVS) on the mountainous southwest, a Central Plain Group (CPG) extending from St. Johns to the southeast, and the Antigua Formation on the northeast portion of the island in the direction of regional dip. The CPG consists of siliciclastic and limestone, marine and non- marine sedimentary rocks, containing petrified wood and gastropods within chert. The Antigua Formation includes benthic foraminifers and molluscs, scleractinian corals, echinoids, crabs, bryozoans, crinoid columns and sponges. The limestone Devil's Bridge, is an example of this formation. On Antigua, the south of the island is mainly calc-alkaline volcanic rock such as dacite and quartz basalt or andesite, along with limestone lenses, agglomerate and tuff formed during the Oligocene. Generally andesite dominated volcanism across the island gave way to limestone and chert formation. Between 200 and 500 CE, native peoples on Antigua were active in lapidary, working local diorite, shells and carnelian as well as imported nephrite, amethyst, turquoise and serpentinite.https://www.gia.edu/doc/Pre-Columbian-Gems-and- Ornamental-Materials-from-Antigua-West-Indies.pdf References Antigua and Barbuda ","title":"Geology of Antigua and Barbuda"},{"id":"59010944","text":"Marion Baumann-Parkhurst (August 21, 1912 ‚Äì April 6, 2009) was an Olympian, registered Nurse, Writer, and survivor of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camps during the Holocaust. Early life Her parents were Frieda and Julius Rosenthal in K√∂nigsberg, Prussia. Marion grew up with a middle-class childhood until the Nazi years. She trained as a 1936 Summer Olympics contestant until her participation was rejected because she was Jewish. When the 1934 Nuremberg Laws went into effect, the Nazi government often refused to accept an honour won by a Jew. These laws cancelled the family's German Citizenship. Jews began to abandon Germany due to the escalation of Nazi cruelty, but Marion's family decided to remain. Soon after the government seized her father's advertising business, they finally decided to flee to the still-free country of Holland. While living there, Baumann-Parkhurst met and later married Walter Baumann. Most Jews in Germany were sent to concentration camps. Marion, her husband, and her parents joined them. Both her parents lost their lives there. Marion and Walter were sent to Bergen-Belsen until they were freed by Allied forces towards the end of the war. = Post-war = They returned to Holland as displaced and stateless people.

She became known to larger audiences for her autobiographical account of the persecution of jews in Nazi Germany, which was published posthumously.  Early life  Jalowicz was born Jewish in Berlin, Germany. When she was 11 the Nazi Party came to power and began to imprison her family members. By age 20, she was forced to fend for herself. She survived by assimilating into German life, pretending to be a non-Jew. She died in Berlin. Her mother died of cancer in 1938. Her father died in 1941. She is survived by her only son, Hermann Simon.  Holocaust and survival  Just before her death in 1998 she recorded 77 cassette tapes of audio with her son, Hermann, for the first time chronicling her experience during the Nazi reign. They were later compiled into a book: Underground in Berlin: A Young Woman's Extraordinary Tale of Survival in the Heart of Nazi Germany. Jalowicz was a forced labourer at the Siemens arms factory in Berlin, but left after the death of her father (a sympathetic supervisor fired her, as forced labourers were not allowed to resign). In 1941, a postman tried to deliver a letter from the job centre and Jalowicz told him her \\"neighbour\\", Marie Jalowicz, had been deported.

Kang grew up in Hong Kong and was bullied as a young girl for being overweight. These tough moments in her youth soon caused an eating disorder and by the time she was 13, Mia had halved her weight, and was soon scouted as a model. She modeled across Asia and Europe through her high school and college years. Kang got a master's degree in finance and financial law in England, and left modeling to work as a commodities trader, before returning to modeling in New York City and winning the 2016 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue model search and being named a 2017 Rookie. Despite her modeling success, Kang was miserable with the eating disorders that she felt the modeling industry demanded to stay thin, until she took up the martial art Muay Thai in Thailand. Training and fighting gained her respect for her body, healthy eating habits, weight and muscle. She now advocates for women's body confidence, while continuing to model at her larger size, and hosting Spy Games, an American reality competition television series.  Early life and modeling  Kang on Uproxx in 2017 Mia Kang was born and raised in Hong Kong, though she has Swiss nationality. Her father is British and her mother is South Korean; they met while living in Taiwan, then moved to Hong Kong for business. Both parents were academics, with her father being a physicist from Oxford University. She has four older half-siblings (two half-sisters with the same father and a Taiwanese mother, and two half- brothers with the same mother and a different British father), but they lived in other parts of the world as she was growing up. As a teenager, Kang studied at and eventually graduated from the international Island School in Hong Kong, but never felt like she fit in. She says the Asian kids would socialize together and the western kids would socialize together, but she was half Korean and half British, and never felt she belonged with either. Kang grew up bullied and overweight, though a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover with model Tyra Banks hung on her wall. When she was 13, a doctor told her she was obese, and at risk of weight related diabetes. So she went to the other extreme and halved her weight in a couple of months, using fasting, purging, and laxatives. She says that she was around before dropping to around ; she was size 14 and became size 0. Also available as At the same time, she grew . The boys who had bullied her now asked her out on dates. Getting thin led to her being scouted as a model while still 13 years old, by her dance teacher. One of her first jobs was a Levi's campaign, and she remembers being surprised seeing her picture in shops in Times Square. After graduating high school, Kang modeled abroad, in Tokyo, Singapore, Milan, and London. For several years she was signed with the London Models 1 agency.  Higher education and finance career  Despite Kang's modeling success, her father advised her to go to college, since modeling could be a short-lived career. So Kang also studied philosophy and economics at Bristol University, earning a bachelor's degree, then got a master's degree in finance and financial law at the School of Oriental and African Studies. She says her education is the thing in her life that she is proudest of, and intends to return one day for a doctorate or an MBA. After graduating, Kang left modeling to use her degree in finance as a London commodities trader. She was on the path to becoming a derivatives consultant in her mid-20s, when she realized she felt stifled and decided to try the modeling profession one more time.  Return to modeling  Kang in swimsuit in 2017 In 2015, Kang signed with Trump Model Management and moved from Hong Kong to New York City, home of most of the world's top models. Sports Illustrated was her first New York City modeling assignment, and she was the first Hongkonger to become a Sports Illustrated model. She also worked in three campaigns for Guess. In August 2016, she defeated five other models from around the world in a public vote and was named the winner of the magazine's Swimsuit 2016 Model Search, to be featured in the 2017 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. She was also declared a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue 2017 Rookie. However, she was very unhappy. She was being asked to starve herself, and go on 10-day liquid diets between photo shoots. It was normal for her to go four days without eating. She was obsessed with being thinner, and living off of \\"Marlboro Lights, black coffee, and alcohol.\\" At her low point, she was contemplating suicide.  Muay Thai and body confidence  Kang in Muay Thai training in 2017 Kang's family have a home in Koh Samui, an island off the east coast of Thailand. Kang was taking a 10-day holiday from modeling there in 2016, when she noticed young fighters from a local gym training in the combat sport Muay Thai by the side of the road, and asked if she could try it; initially just to help her lose more of the weight that she was told she needed to. The coaches were impressed enough by her workout that they suggested she join. The 10 days turned into a six or nine-month training camp, of six day a week routines. The martial arts training taught her to respect her body. The workouts were so intense she forgot she smoked. She stopped restricting what she ate, added 20-30+ pounds, became more muscled, and gained definition. Her dress size went from a size two-four to a size four-six. Kang in Muay Thai training in 2017 Kang began to alternate her time between training and returning to New York for modeling. She kept training in New York with Phil Nurse at The Wat, and Hollywood Hino of Church Street Boxing, for about three hours daily, and in Thailand at the Bangkok Yokkao and her first gym, Yodyut, on Koh Samui, for about six hours each day. She decided to compete in her first professional Muay Thai fight in May 2017. She would have done it earlier, but her modeling agency objected strenuously; the money wasn't much compared to US modeling fees, and being injured in a fight would put her career in doubt. At least she needed to first shoot the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Sports Illustrated promised to film the fight for a digital documentary. She took a month long training with legendary Muay Thai fighter Saenchai to prepare for her fight. Kang's first professional fight was on 7 May 2017. She was matched against Thai fighter Nong B, who had 5 bouts experience. Kang took an elbow to the eye in the first round, which, she says, made her mad, since her face is her livelihood. She won the second round, then went in with \\"heavy hands\\" in the third round, hitting her opponent hard, and winning by technical knockout. After her victory, Kang was excited to continue into mixed martial arts, and signed with manager Malki Kawa of leading MMA agency First Round Management. Kang in Muay Thai training in 2017 Kang credits Muay Thai for teaching her to love her body and even saving her life. She became a body confidence advocate, encouraging all women to have strong and healthy bodies. She started her own all-female boxing club in SoHo, New York, called \\"Killa Girl Gang\\", after her fighting name, \\"Killa Kang\\", for all levels of fitness. She hosted a body positivity retreat on Koh Samui with travel agency 109 World.

Also available as Also available as Kang was named a 2018 Today Show Style Hero, and the 2019 Self magazine New Year's Challenge star. Kang continues to model, but says that her new size, eight or ten in 2018, puts her above the standard model sizes, and yet below the plus-size model sizes, so clients ask that she either gain or lose weight. In 2020, Kang became the host of Spy Games, a reality competition television series on the American television channel Bravo, in which ten contestants compete in spy-inspired exercises for $100,000.  Charity work  Kang tries to work with a charity in every country she models in. She supports the Wor Watthana Muay Thai gym that helps children in an impoverished region of northeast Thailand.

Holbrook's work examines the relationship between humans and the night sky, and she has produced scientific publications on cultural astronomy, starburst galaxies, and star formation regions.  Early life and education  Jarita Holbrook was born in 1965 in Honolulu, Hawaii and grew up in San Bernardino and Los Angeles, California. Holbrook comes from a family of academics: her grandparents, James and Mary Holbrook, were both professors at Alcorn State University, her aunt, Edna Holbrook, is an assistant professor in the Mathematics department at Jackson State University and both of her parents obtained science degrees. Holbrook studied physics at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and earned a B.S. in 1987. After completing her undergraduate studies, Holbrook (RPCV) did her Peace Corps service as a science teacher in Fiji at the Ratu Navula Secondary School. She then continued her physics education at San Diego State University leading to an M.S. in Astronomy in 1992. After completing her M.S., she worked at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Holbrook received her PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1997 where she investigated star formation efficiency in the infrared focusing on Orion BN-kl and GL 2136.  Career  Post-PhD, Holbrook shifted focus to the interdisciplinary field of cultural astronomy and she began laying the foundation for encouraging research on African Indigenous Astronomy. During this time, Holbrook worked at UCLA's Center for the Cultural Studies of Science, Technology, and Medicine as an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Fellow with Sharon Traweek. She also did postdoctoral work at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science. After completing her postdoctoral work, Holbrook took a position at the University of Arizona in the Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology. Her work examined indigenous African astronomy and how celestial navigation continues to be practiced regardless of electronic navigational aids such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). In addition, she studied navigation by the stars among ocean-going communities in Fiji, Tunisia, and the USA; organized the first African Cultural Astronomy conference in Ghana (2006); and began research on diversity issues among astrophysicists. This work led to her attaining academic positions in applied Anthropology (UA) and Gender studies (UCLA).

Early life and education  Gordon Awandare was born in Kandiga, a small village in northeastern Ghana. During childhood, he contracted malaria several times a year, at a time when treatment for the disease was scarce. Awandare was awarded a BSc in Biochemistry in 1998 and an MPhil in Biochemistry in 2002 from the University of Ghana. In 2003, he was alerted to PhD positions at the University of Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania, USA) earmarked for African fellows, and moved to the USA just eight months later. In 2007, he graduated with a PhD in Infectious Diseases and Microbiology from the School of Public Health, with a thesis on severe malarial anemia. . Following his doctoral studies, he spent three years at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (Maryland, USA), where he continued studying malaria, focusing on the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. He returned to the University of Ghana in 2010 to establish his own research group . Without start-up funding, he used US credit cards to support his work whilst applying for grants, and two years later received funding from both the Royal Society and the National Institutes of Health.  Parasitology research  Awandare's research focuses on the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the infection it causes in children. His work focuses on both the immune response of the patient to infection, and the pathogenic processes of the parasite itself. In particular, he studies cell-surface receptors that could be potential vaccine targets and his studies use parasites from infected children in Ghana, so that any vaccines developed will be applicable to real- life cases.  WACCBIP  In 2013, Gordon Awandare led a consortium from the University of Ghana in a proposal to set up a new African Centre of Excellence to research infectious pathogens in Africa. The consortium consisted of faculty from the Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology (BCMB) and the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR), with support from staff of the University of Ghana Computing Systems (UGCS). Following the award of $8 million from the World Bank in November 2013, Awandare became the Founding Director of The West African Center for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens (WACCBIP). The organization has since received further funding from the World Bank ACE project and the Wellcome Trust DELTAS programme. The mission of WACCBIP is to \\"improve the diagnosis, prevention, and control of tropical diseases in sub-Saharan Africa by providing advanced-level training and research excellence in cell and molecular biology\\" , with a remit to build capacity by training African scientists at masters, doctoral and post-doctoral levels. The center has expanded to study malaria, Buruli ulcer, HIV, and tuberculosis.  Awards and recognition  In 2015, Awandare was awarded the Royal Society Africa Award, which recognises innovative biological research scientists whose research also contributes towards significant capacity building in Africa. The award was made for \\"achievements in molecular and cellular studies of malaria, including how malaria parasites invade red blood cells and cause disease\\".

Its apparent visual magnitude varies between 6.67 and 6.76 in a cycle of 69.51 days. It is classified as an Œ±2 Canum Venaticorum variable. System The HN Andromedae system is triple, as seen in periodic radial velocity variations. The primary component is a star that is leaving the main sequence with an absolute magnitude Mv=, dominates the observed spectrum and its spectral classification is A2pSrCrEu, meaning that it has stronger than usual absorption lines of strontium, chromium and europium. It is also a chemically peculiar star and classified as an Ap star. The other two components contribute just 0.23 magnitudes to the apparent magnitude of HN Andromedae. One has an orbital period of 106.3 days, and some orbital parameters can be computed. The other has an orbital period longer than 5000 days. Variability The variability of HN Andromedae can be totally ascribed to the primary component, and is compatible with its stellar rotation; this gives the classification as an Œ±2 Canum Venaticorum variable. Magnetic fields in this star are strong and variable, and this is thought to happen when the magnetic dipole axis in the star is not aligned to the rotation axis. Also, the distribution of metals, and consequently the surface brightness, is not uniform on the surface, and this causes the brightness observed variation.

Ybarra is also Research Director of the adaptive social cognition lab, and he was Director of Innovate Blue, an organization focusing on innovation and entrepreneurship education. He has also been a visiting professor at Southwest University in Chongqing, China. His research largely revolves around the impact that social connections and social dynamics have on individuals and groups, particularly how patterns of social interaction influence individual cognition, how social media and social networking sites affect wellbeing, and how perceptions of trust and threat affect interpersonal and intergroup relations. Ybarra is also the co-founder of cred-ABLE LLC, a company that designs research-based assessments for individuals, teams, and small to mid-size companies. Early life Ybarra was born and raised in Alpine, Texas. He attended Alpine High School, where he played football and baseball and was a percussionist in the band. He's a first generation American, as his parents moved to the United States from northern Mexico. His grandfather Ram√≥n was a rancher who raised cattle to be sold both in Mexico and the United States. Ybarra has two older brothers and a younger sister. He's a first-generation college student. Education Ybarra did not finish high school and got his GED instead. He took a few years before starting college at Sul Ross State University (SRSU). He initially focused his studies on biology, but eventually became interested in psychology. Ybarra earned a B.A. in psychology, and in 1990 earned a master's degree in political science. He then started graduate work at New Mexico State University. In 1996 he received his PhD in experimental social psychology, focusing on social memory processes that can impair the development of trust in relationships. Research Ybarra directs the Adaptive Social Cognition Lab (ASC Lab), a lab that pursues various research programs related to social networking and interpersonal connection. Ybarra's research primarily focuses on people's interactions and the development of relationships, examining how interpersonal and intergroup sentiments facilitate or impair the development of meaningful relationships, and the effect that such relationships have on people's ability to manage their attention, reason well and make good decisions, and maintain one's wellbeing. Publications Ybarra has studied and written about general cognitive functioning being promoted by socializing, social network site use and wellbeing, cross cultural differences and group dynamics, and judgement and interpersonal processes. His research has received much national and international media coverage, and his research findings on older adults and cognitive functioning have been used in U.S. congressional hearings. Future projects Ybarra maintains several research collaborations and a large collection of research and writing projects. These include ongoing research on socializing and the risk of developing dementia (which he conducts with his colleague Hiroko Dodge in neurology), how and when social networking sites influence wellbeing (a long-term collaboration with colleagues Ethan Kross, John Jonides, and Phillippe Verduyn), the basis of a sense of meaning and purpose in life, and the importance of executive functions in effective leader behavior (with colleague Todd Chan). He is also currently working on two book projects, one dealing with the cultivation of skills that allow people to be adaptive in their career paths, and another dealing with the \\"two educations\\" all students entering college should get.

She served as a union organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in El Paso, Texas. She organized the 1965 strike at Hortex Manufacturing Company and the 1971 strike at Levi Strauss.  Early life  Gonzales was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1920 and raised on a ranch outside of Von Ormy, Texas. She was one of two daughters among the four Gonzales children. She attended high school in Somerset, Texas, near modern day San Antonio, and enjoyed sports, including volleyball and basketball. Her siblings became her earlier influences by joining the Amalgamated Butchers of America Union. She dropped out of high school after tenth grade when she turned eighteen. She then moved to San Antonio with one of her brothers.  Career  In 1956 Gonzales began working for a sweater company in San Antonio. After 3 years she became involved with ILGWU as its first female Mexican-American organizer. After 10 years with the union, the Tex-Son Garment Company in San Antonio began outsourcing labor to non-unionized firms out of state, prompting the San Antonio IGLWU local to go on strike. In 1959 Gonzales organized and led the effort, achieving a boycott of the company's products across Texas, and employing clever tactics to pressure the company. Joined by both white and Latina women (a heretofore unprecedented phenomena) Gonzales utilized fashion to dispel accusations of unladylike behavior attributed to the female strikers and to reinforce the women's persona as workers, including many spouses and mothers. During the strike, Gonzales made news describing the violent interactions between the strikers and the workers. Gonzales claimed that the workers meant to beat her up but failed. Instead they sent down voodoo dolls with stick pins.Irene Ledesma, Unlikely Strikers: Mexican American Women in Strike Activity in Texas, 1919‚Äì1974 (Ph.D. dissertation, Ohio State University, 1992) The doll was dressed as Gonzales and she posed for a photo for the local newspaper to taunt the workers. However, the state's anti-union tendencies along with increasing counteraction from the owner and dissenting employees caused Gonzales to withdraw from the strike one year before its unsuccessful end in 1963. Gonzales' talents were next deployed by the ACWA and the Federation of Union Representatives. From El Paso, Texas Gonzales became involved in important strikes against companies including Hortex Manufacturing Company, Levi Strauss and Farah Manufacturing Company over an 18-year span from 1965 to 1983 when she retired. During this period, she helped lead, organize, and implement effective boycotts. Her tenacity is said to have played a role in inspiring female strikers to join strikes and testify, overcoming their hesitancy to incur criticism from their male managers.  Personal life  Little is known of Gonzales‚Äô personal life other than that she was married to George Gray for 4 years in 1941 and, later, to Tony Moreno in 1955. She first married at age 21 and bore two sons, George, Jr. and Daniel who served in the Air Force. Her second marriage to Moreno lasted for 15 years until 1970. In an interview with Irene Ledesma, Gonzales divulged that Moreno was jealous and possessive, even requesting that she drive more often, rather than sit in the passenger seat, so that she would not wave to other men on the street. Gonzales lived in El Paso until her death in San Antonio in 1995.  Legacy  Gonzales is remembered as an innovative union organizer and champion of female participation in labor union activities. Hailed with a plaque bestowed upon her by the ACWA in 1983, Gonzales is credited in organizing the Tex-Son strike which saw the first cooperation of Caucasian and Latina women in a strike in the country. She was the first female ILGWU union organizer.

Discovered in 1959 and brought into production in 1970, Kapuni remained New Zealand's only producing gas- condensate field until the offshore Maui gas field began production in 1979.  Geology = Geologic history = During the Lower Cretaceous (~150-100 Ma) Rangitata Orogeny, an accretionary wedge accumulated and was uplifted on the margin of Gondwana in present-day New Zealand. The resulting topography was eroded throughout the Cretaceous. After the Rangitata Orogeny, seafloor spreading commenced during the Middle Cretaceous. This resulted in the formation of the Tasman Sea as New Zealand separated from Australia. Normal faults, including the Manaia Fault, formed as the Taranaki Basin developed during seafloor spreading. Rifting continued until the Eocene (~56 Ma), when the Taranaki Basin underwent passive subsidence. Kapuni collected abundant organic material under coastal plain and fluvio-estuarine environments during much of the Eocene. A broad marine transgression occurred in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene (~28-20 Ma), and mudstones were deposited on top of the Eocene organic-rich shales and sandstones. Cretaceous to Paleocene rift- related normal faults were reactivated in the Late Eocene (~40-34 Ma) and experienced substantial basin inversion in the Late Miocene (~12-5 Ma). During this time, north-plunging inversion structures, including the Kapuni Anticline, developed along the Manaia Fault and other rift-structures in the Taranaki Basin's Eastern Mobile Belt. Further west, in the Taranaki Basin's Western Stable Platform, Cretaceous rift-related faults experienced little strain. Cenozoic compression in the Taranaki Basin has generally been attributed to a change in stress regime caused by the development of the Hikurangi Subduction System between the Pacific and Australian Plates off the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. Late Eocene compressional structures in the Taranaki Basin correspond with a period of elevated uplift rates along the Alpine Fault on New Zealand's South Island that has also been attributed to the nearby subduction zone. Kapuni is located on the Australian Plate, west of the plate boundary zone and above the subducting Pacific Plate. Current geothermal gradients in the Taranaki Basin vary from 33-35 ¬∞C/km offshore near the Maui Field and in northern portions of the Taranaki Peninsula to 25 ¬∞C/km in Kapuni and other southeast portions of the Taranaki Peninsula. = Source Rocks = Kapuni's source rocks are a series of type III kerogen-rich coal sequences in the Eocene (~56-34 Ma) Mangahewa Formation of the Kapuni Group. These coals were deposited under coastal plain and fluo-estuarine environments and reach up to 10 m in thickness. alt= = Reservoirs = Like its source rocks, Kapuni's reservoir layers are located in the Eocene Mangahewa Formation and were deposited as part of a general transgressive sequence. The reservoirs are predominantly sandstones, shales, and coals deposited in shore, fluvial, and estuarine environments. Kapuni's reservoirs are located below a depth of 3000 m. They range in average thickness from 20 m to 130 m, average natural- gas fraction from 0.06 to 0.95, and average porosity from 12.2% to 16.8% by volume. = Kapuni Anticline = Hydrocarbons of the Kapuni Field are trapped by the Kapuni Anticline, in the hanging wall of the east-dipping Manaia Fault, a reverse fault in the Eastern Mobile Belt. The Kapuni Anticline is asymmetric, doubly-plunging, and approximately 18 km long and 8 km wide. The Manaia Fault initially developed as a normal fault bounding the Manaia Graben during Cretaceous to Early Eocene rifting associated with the opening of the Tasman Sea. Dextral transpression associated with the Hikurangi Subduction System caused fault reactivation and basin inversion during the Eocene and Miocene, resulting in the development of the Kapuni Anticline. Maximum throw on the Manaia Fault is 900 m. = Seal = Middle Oligocene (~30-25 Ma) mudstones of the Otaraoa Formation overly the Mangahewa Formation, sealing Kapuni's reservoirs. These mudstones were deposited under a continental shelf environment as part of the same broad transgressive sequence under which the Mangahewa Formation was deposited. = Faulting = Faulting is pervasive in the Kapuni Group and predominantly consists of southwest-northeast right- lateral and northwest-southeast left-lateral strike-slip faults. These faults were formed under transpressional and compressional stress regimes during the Late Eocene to Late Miocene and are indicative of an east-west direction of maximum compressive stress. In the northern portion of the Kapuni Anticline, these two dominant fault trends become nearly orthogonal to one another. This is a result of fault block rotation that produced necessary extension along the anticline's younger units during fold growth. = Secondary porosity = Kapuni's gas is CO2-rich, containing approximately 40-45 mol% CO2. This has facilitated significant diagenesis and the development of secondary porosity, especially in the K3E reservoir, one of the field's main producing reservoirs. Beginning approximately 5 Ma, thermal maturation of source rocks expelled CO2, which dissolved into groundwater. The acidic groundwater migrated updip towards the crest of the Kapuni anticline, dissolving feldspar and carbonates along its route. Intervals of coarser clasts experienced net dissolution, while finer-grained intervals experienced precipitation of authigenic clays, carbonates, and quartz. Precipitation of quartz and carbonate cements began approximately 4 Ma at temperatures exceeding 100 ¬∞C. The carbon isotope signature of carbonate cements in the K3E reservoir suggests an intraformational origin. As a result of diagenesis, the K3E reservoir contains areas exhibiting significant secondary porosity and enhanced reservoir quality along with tight, cemented regions of poor reservoir quality.  Production history  399x399px New Zealand's first natural gas field, Kapuni was discovered in 1959 by a team consisting of Royal Dutch/Shell, British Petroleum, and Todd Energy. Production of oil (mainly condensate and natural gas liquids) began in 1970, and production of natural gas began in 1971. Production peaked in 1977 at over 64 PJ/year of gas and nearly 31 PJ/year of oil. Kapuni's production declined precipitously after the more productive, offshore Maui gas field began producing in 1979. British Petroleum sold its ownership of Kapuni to Royal Dutch/Shell and Todd Energy in 1991, and Todd Energy became the field's sole owner in 2017. As of 2011 Kapuni produces nearly 18 PJ/year of natural gas and 2.25 PJ/year of oil. This accounts for 9.9% of New Zealand's natural gas production and 2.3% of New Zealand's oil production. As production has naturally decreased over time, Kapuni's ownership has implemented hydraulic fracturing, water shutoffs, gas re- injections and other supplemental production techniques since the 1980s. With four wells having been established by the end of field appraisal in 1963, Kapuni has grown to presently consist of twenty wells across nine wellsites. Natural gas and liquids are separated, processed, and treated for CO2 onsite.

The oldest rocks are 615 million year old metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks, intruded by diorite and trondhjemite in the Cap de Miquelon Group. The metamorphic rocks are descended from an earlier volcanic arc-marine platform, rather than more ancient basement rock from the Avalonia microcontinent. The St. Pierre Group formed 581 million years ago with felsic and pyroclastic flows. Together with mafic rocks and andesite, they are evidence of back arc environment. The late Neoproterozoic Belle-Riviere Group includes bimodal volcanic rocks such as basalt and rhyolite overlain by terrestrial sedimentary rock. Belle-Riviere Group rocks partially overlie the Tommotian Fortune Group and the early and middle Cambrian Langlade Group, which have fossiliferous limestone beds and siltstone. Discordant contact between older Precambrian rocks and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks as well as thrust faults indicate Acadian orogeny related deformation.

History In 1947 the country decided to rebuild its infrastructure and re-opened the local chemical plant which manufactured explosive materials in 1947. In 1949 its employees registered a sports club under the name Ko≈Ço Sportowe Wis≈Ça ≈Åƒôgnowo or KS Wis≈Ça for short. The club was re-registered as Unia ≈Åƒôgnowo in 1951. In the 1950s and 1960s, the club played in the lowest regional competitions. The matches were played on a grass pitch at ul. Hutnicza, near the gate of the plant of Zak≈Çady Chemiczne Zachem. A significant increase in the sporting level took place in the mid-1970s after the club's name was changed to BKS Chemik, incorporated into the parent multi-sports club which base was expanded to include a football stadium in Wy≈ºyny along with a training ground complex. In the 1976/1977 season the players played for the first time in the third league, and in the 1979/1980 season they participated for the first time in the second league. In 1979, to celebrate the promotion of Chemik to the second tier, a friendly match was played with the West German club FC Oberrot, which was won 8:0. The match was watched by 10 000 fans. The 1980s saw Chemik back in the third division. After obtaining sponsorship from Weltinex in 1991, they were promoted back up for two seasons (1991‚Äì1993). In the 1991/1992 season they reached the highest league pyramid position in the club's history, 5th in the second tier. Then, for 13 seasons (until 2006) they played in the third division. In the years 2001‚Äì2004 they performed under the name of Chemik / Zawisza Bydgoszcz after a controversial merger with Zawisza Bydgoszcz. Zawisza's reserve team was initially meant to be called Zawisza-Chemik, although ultimately the reserve team remained as simply \\"Zawisza\\". The merger turned out to be very unsuccessful, and the Zawisza's senior side started anew from the bottom of the league pyramid, with the senior merged side reverting to \\"Chemik\\", leaving the reserve team in the fifth division, which subsequently became Zawisza's senior team. After the autumn round of 2011, the team withdrew from the fourth league, falling into the district league as a result. Since 2015, the team has been promoted every year. In the 2017/2018 season, the club has climbed back into the fifth division.

In an introductory note the author explains that the quotations within the text are taken from various versions, both medieval and modern, of the Tristram romance. US first edition Plot Ellen Pascoe, a working class Cornish woman of 33, had endured a difficult childhood: first in her father's small cottage in a village near Land's End; then in St Ives where she had helped gut and clean the fish brought back by the fishing fleet, helped by her close childhood friend Susan Pengilly; and then, after her father's death, caring for her elderly grandmother in an isolated cottage on Bodmin Moor. For years she had been intending to marry Derek Tregonny, one of the fishermen, a man severely affected by his wartime experiences 20 years earlier and who had become taciturn and sometimes surly. Their poverty had over the years always prevented them from naming a specific date for their wedding. When Ellen secures a job as a live-in waitress at a hotel in Tintagel, and Derek unexpectedly finds a local market for his lobsters, the couple at last have sufficient funds, and they decide to marry later that year on Michaelmas Day. One of the hotel's guests, an American academic, tells Ellen about Lyonesse and Tintagel's mythological past, and encourages her to read the romance of Tristram and Iseult. He investigates a local stone with a hole in it that is reputed to grant the wish of anybody who climbs through, and he offers to climb through on her behalf. She makes a secret wish. As Ellen's knowledge increases and her outlook expands, she feels herself to be awakening and capable of thoughts and ambitions previously unknown to her. She decides to stay in Tintagel, to get Derek a job in the local quarry, and to rent a small cottage nearby. She hopes to be able to enthuse Derek with her new-found outlook and ambitions, but is assailed by doubts and misgivings. A postcard unexpectedly arrives for her at the hotel. Sent by Susan, it informs her that Derek has drowned. The manager allows Ellen a short period of leave, and she takes the next charabanc to Land‚Äôs End where the burial is to take place. On the way, the driver, who does not know of her connection with the dead man, informs her that Derek committed suicide. After the burial, she goes back with Susan to the house of Derek's mother who bitterly blurts out her wish that Derek had married one of the two women, rather than being ‚Äòopen- handed‚Äô and giving himself to both of them. Susan stays silent. Later that evening, Susan confesses her ‚Äòwickedness‚Äô in having persuaded Derek to be unfaithful to Ellen. She talks guiltily of the happy times they had had walking in the countryside, with Derek gradually opening up and becoming happier, as if emerging from a prison. Susan fearfully tells Ellen of the ‚Äòwicked wish‚Äô she had made one day when they had visited the holed stone together, that Derek and Ellen should never marry: a wish that came true. But instead of angrily rejecting Susan, as she had expected, Ellen tells her that she is happy to hear that Derek did not remain shut up in himself, even for a short while. Ellen realises her hopes and visions for Derek had come alive, and she tells Susan that she too had made a wish on the stone that had come true. She invites Susan to join her in Tintagel. Critical reception Writing in The Rotarian in 1939, the reviewer William Lyon Phelps considered the author to have created out of Tristan and Iseult and the situation of two ignorant waitresses and a laborer a structure of ineffable grace. Kirkus Reviews considered the book to be an \\"effective piece of work, quiet, simple, poetic\\". Adaptation In 1946 the novel was adapted by Thomas Job as a Broadway play entitled Land's End, with Shirley Booth as Susan and Helen Craig as Ellen.

It is found on the seabed in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is a suspension feeder and catches food particles floating past with its branching feeding tentacles. Description Thyone fusus has an oval body up to long. The anterior (front) end has a mouth surrounded by a circle of ten branching tentacles while the posterior (back) end bears the anus and is bluntly rounded. There are a few tube feet, and these may be arranged in longitudinal rows. The skin is smooth and fine with few calcareous spicules; these spicules are usually table-shaped, with four holes and a pair of fused rods making a spire, and may also be present in the tube feet. The colour of this sea cucumber is usually some shade of brown, pink or white. Distribution and habitat Thyone fusus is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, its range extending from Norway southwards to Madeira. In the British Isles it is present from the Shetland Isles southwards along the east coast of Scotland to Northumberland. Its depth range is from . It is found in sheltered positions on shelly and muddy seabeds where it lies buried with just the tentacles and anterior end exposed. Ecology Thyone fusus is a suspension feeder, consuming diatoms, single- cell algae and drifting organic particles, as well as zooplankton such as copepods, ostracods, protozoans, nematodes, jellyfish and larvae. The two ventral feeding tentacles are much shorter than the others and have forked ends. Each large tentacle in turn shrinks and folds and is pushed into the mouth. A small tentacle is held close to the mouth and cooperates with each of the others by scraping off any food particles that are still adhering to the large one when it is withdrawn from the mouth. On the western coast of Ireland, these sea cucumbers bury themselves in the sediment between October and February and go into a form of hibernation. They do not feed during this time and their body wall condition deteriorates, but the gonads continue developing, and spawning takes place in early spring.

Brauman is an American scientist who uses an interdisciplinary tool set to examine the interactions between land use change and water resources. Brauman is the lead scientist for the Global Water Initiative at University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment. Early life and education Brauman, daughter of two chemists (John I. Brauman and Sharon K Brauman), grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and had mixed feelings about being a scientist. She notes that it was her undergraduate mentor, Robert Pollack who helped her see the connections between her desire to be creative and affect things that people care about, with science. Brauman graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Science and Religion from Columbia University in 2000. After college she worked at the Natural Resources Defense Council from 2001 to 2004 where she was the Membership and Public Education Senior Associate. She credits her time at the NRDC for making her realize that the environment, in particular water and energy, are areas that people care deeply about; plus questions around water and energy need to be approached from multiple angles: biophysical, economic, and social, to find real-world solutions. After her time with the NRDC, she went on to get her Ph.D. at Stanford University, funded by the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship and the Lucille Packard Stanford Graduate Fellowship, within the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources with an emphasis in hydrologic ecosystem services in 2010. Brauman's interdisciplinary dissertation, under the direction of Gretchen Daily and David Freyberg, brought together elements of hydrology, ecohydrology, and economics to understand the impacts of water extraction on the Big Island of Hawai'i. Career and research Currently, Brauman is the Lead Scientist of the Global Water Assessment under the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota. Brauman's research incorporates economics and policy into her examination of the availability of water resources. Much of her work examines how human changes to our landscape, in particular through the growing of food, affect the quality and quantity of our water resources. Brauman's interest in understanding and valuing the ecosystem services of landscapes runs through much of her work - whether it be provisioning drinking water, irrigation water, carbon sequestration, or food security. Her research, at the intersection of society and science, provides critical information to resource managers (e.g. agricultural producers) that can improve water use efficiency. Brauman also works collaboratively with multiple international groups examining ecosystem services globally. She is part of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), a group advocating for recognition of the value of nature to human populations. =Notable publications= Brauman's work, published in a variety of peer- reviewed journals (e.g. Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy Sciences, Environmental Research Letters, Water Resources Research) is highly cited.

Ward claimed that could have been the largest network of licensed cannabis professionals in the world at its peak. Purpose On Colorado Badged Network, members find jobs, employees, legal advice, compliance updates, industry events, and friends. It's been called the \\"water cooler of the industry\\", and the goal is to keep is accessible to everyone with a Colorado Department of Revenue Occupational License, which is known as a \\"badge\\" in Colorado. History The group was first created as Colorado Badged Jobs in 2015, in order for Webb to find employees to work in his cannabis grow warehouse. He quickly brought in co-founders Maccarone and Witherell to help. The organization grew steadily for its first year, and it became used for more purposes than just job-searching, such as removing cannabis smell for clothing, what are the best trimming shears, how to best budtend, announcing new products, and venting about Metrc. In early 2017, the three co-founders decided to rename the group to Colorado Badged Network to better reflect its new identity. This has been a volunteer position for them through 2018, without any financial compensation; they're cannabis industry members themselves. Members In June 2018, the group had over 5000 members. By November 2018, the Colorado Badged Network grew to more than 6100 members. CBN is very active, being described as \\"robust\\". As of June 2018, there were about 40 posts per day. Representatives from Mary‚Äôs Medicinals, Bronnor Corporation, the Cannabis Connoisseurs‚Äô Coalition Committee have expressed that they find high value in the group. Criticism Some badge-holders have refused to join the group due to \\"privacy concerns\\", because the co-founders verify unique badge numbers. The State of Colorado keeps a database of every occupational license holder, which is searchable by both name and badge number. Witherell has made a statement about these privacy concerns, clarifying, \\"We only verify publicly accessible information to grant access to the network.\\" See also * National Cannabis Industry Association * Colorado Department of Revenue * Cannabis product testing * Budtender ReferencesExternal links Facebook Group: CBN Official Organizations established in 2015 Organizations based in Denver Cannabis in Colorado Cannabis companies Cannabis culture 2015 in cannabis Companies based in Denver ","title":"Colorado Badged Network"},{"id":"59012036","text":"Meuser is a surname.

It has silvery, oval leaves of 5‚Äì8 cm (2.0‚Äì3.2 in) long and ‚Äì4 cm (1.0‚Äì1.6 in) wide, with one large tooth supported by two smaller teeth near the tip, at an upward angle and somewhat overlapping each other. The inflorescences are set just below the growing tip, are cylinder-shaped, 10‚Äì12 cm (4‚Äì5 in) high, topped by a crest of small, more or less horizontal, pinkish-purple tinged leaves. It consists of several flower heads in the axils of golden leaves with a pinkish wash that form a hood shielding the underlying flower head. Each flower head contains eight to twelve individual flowers, with amber-colored styles topped by blackish purple pollen presenters and grey silky perianth lobes. It is endemic to the Fynbos ecoregion of South Africa, being confined to the Kogelberg mountain range. The mace pagoda was twice presumed extinct, but reappeared in its natural habitat from seed, after a wildfire several decades later.  Description  Mimetes stokoei is an evergreen, upright, slender, column-like, mostly unbranched shrub of 1‚Äì2 m (3‚Äì ft) high, with the main stem up to cm (1 in) thick at ground level. In the upper part it may sometimes have up to three, felty hairy branches ‚Äì cm (0.2‚Äì0.3 in) thick. The pointed, ovate or broadly oval leaves are set alternately along the branches, at an upward angle and somewhat overlapping, and lack both stipules and petioles. They are 5‚Äì8 cm (2.0‚Äì3.2 in) long and ‚Äì4 cm (1.0‚Äì1.6 in) wide, silvery due to a dense layer of silky hairs, have a slightly heart-shaped base, and an entire margin with a prominent tooth at the tip, secunded by two smaller teeth. The inflorescences are set just below the top of the branches; they are broadly cylinder-shaped, 10‚Äì15 cm (4‚Äì6 in) high, and topped by a flattened crest of smallish, horizontal, pinkish-purple tinged leaves. It consists of several flowerheads in the axils of golden yellow leaves with a pinkish-purple wash during flowering, at a moderate upward angle that form a hood shielding the underlying flower head. Each flowerhead contains eight to twelve individual flowers. The outer whorl of involucral bracts, that encircle the flower heads, are oval to rounded, 1‚Äì cm (0.4‚Äì0.6 in) long and ‚Äì cm (0.3‚Äì0.6 in) wide. The bracts on the inside of the head are oblong or bluntly line-shaped, ‚Äì2 cm (0.6‚Äì0.8 in) long and 3‚Äì8 mm (0.12‚Äì0.32 in) wide. All have some silky hair on the outer surface and a dense row of equal length, silky hairs along its rim. The bract subtending each flower is line-shaped or long spoon-shaped with a blunt tip, ‚Äì cm (0.6‚Äì0.7 in) long and 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) wide, and covered in dense soft matted hairs. The 4-merous perianth is ‚Äì cm (1.4‚Äì1.8 in) long. The lower part, a tube, that remains merged when the flower is open, is about 5 mm (0.2 in) long, square in cross-section, hairless at the base becoming felty at the top. The four segments in the middle part (or claws), are thread- to line-shaped and densely felty. The segments in the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are difficult to distinguish from the claws, threat- to line-shaped with a pointy tip, felty and 6‚Äì8 mm (¬º‚Äì‚Öì in) long. The four anthers lack a filament and are directly connected to the limbs, with black connecting tissue at the tip broadly arrow- to spade- shaped. From the centre of the perianth emerges a style of 5‚Äì cm (2.0‚Äì2.4 in) long. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is inverted cone-shaped with ring at its base, and a narrower neck, and a pointy pappilus at its tip that has a groove that functions as the stigma across the tip. The 1‚Äì2 mm (0.04‚Äì0.08 in) long ovary is difficult to distinguish from the style, and is subtended by four pointy, line-shaped scales of about 3 mm (0.12 in) long. = Differences with related species = The mace pagoda can be distinguished from other Mimetes species by its monopodial, columnar habit, the silver-haired oval leaves, with a large tooth in the middle and two smaller teeth, and the rounded bracts of the involucre.  Taxonomy  As far as known, the mace pagoda was first collected by Thomas Pearson Stokoe, who found just a single specimen somewhere in the Kogelberg mountains above Kleinmond in February 1922. He sent it to the herbarium at Kew in London, where it was described by Edwin Percy Phillips and John Hutchinson, naming it after its collector M. stokoei in 1922.  Distribution and habitat  M. stokoei is endemic to the Kogelberg Nature Reserve, Western Cape province of South Africa, where it only occurs in one location on the Paardeberg, in the upper reaches of the Palmiet river near Kleinmond. It grows on a gentle slope of weathered Table Mountain Sandstone that is dry in the summer and wet during the winter at an altitude of . The species is fast growing and relatively short-lived. Specimens were observed to start flowering at an age of around four years. Apparently, it is present in the soil seed bank for decades, until a suitably intense fire triggers germination. Flower heads may develop at any time during the year. It is assumed that like other Mimetes species, the mace pagoda is pollinated by birds and the seeds are distributed by ants.  Conservation  Following his initial find, Stokoe tried to locate further specimens, but failed to do so until he spotted it in one of the buckets of a female wild flower vendor on Adderley Street Flower Market, Cape Town, in 1925. After much persuasion, the lady guided him to a small stand of this species. At that time, these were already aged plants. In 1959 all plants in this location had died, and as no other population was known, the species was presumed extinct. In an effort to make better use of the horticultural potential and curb the general deterioration of the Cape flora, Oudenbos, a farm to experiment with growing Proteaceae, was established in 1964 in the upper Palmiet River Valley. Some of the terrain was burned to clear the natural vegetation. In 1965 a rogue seedling was discovered on the edge of a planthole, that was identified as a mace pagoda. The plant snapped on a plant support during a storm, and again M. stokoei had apparently died out. The location was given up when in 1973 another experimental farm was started. In 1999 a particularly intense wildfire swept the upper Palmiet Valley, and in January 2001 twenty four silvery seedlings of the mace pagoda were found. These plants started flowering in 2005 and blooming reached a peak in 2007. By 2009 only five plants were still alive. In 2011 a new, less intense fire destroyed the remaining plants. The continued survival is somewhat less threatened since horticulturalists have succeeded in grafting cuttings of the mace pagoda on the rootstock of Leucospermum hypophyllocarpodendron. The mace pagoda is considered critically endangered due to its minute distribution area of only and its small, fluctuating population. The species was probably threatened by the collection of flowers in the wild. Current threats include too high frequency wildfires and the root disease Phytophthora.

Early life John Thompson was born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. His father, John Anderson Thompson, owned and operated a typewriter store there. His mother, Grace George, was active in promoting early childhood education. She died when he was five years old, a devastating loss and the subject of his posthumously published novel Things to Put Away. Thompson attended Sigsbee School (1924-1930) and Ottawa Hills High School (Michigan) (1930-1936), where he wrote and produced Paul Bunyon, a verse play with music from Stravinsky under the tutelage of his beloved teacher Mary Baloyan. Education Thompson attended Grand Rapids Junior College for two years and was then admitted on full scholarship to Kenyon College to be a student of John Crowe Ransom. There he lived at Douglass House, the writer's house, with Robert Lowell, Peter Taylor (writer), Robie Macauley, and Randall Jarrell. Saunders p. 240. He graduated magna cum laude in 1940. He was admitted to Columbia University for graduate studies but deferred for military service from 1941 to 1945. At Columbia, Thompson studied poetry and literature and received his Ph.D. in 1957 under the mentorship of Lionel Trilling. He taught as an English instructor at Bard College (1946-1947), Sarah Lawrence College (1947-1949), as well as at Columbia University (1949-1956) while doing graduate studies. His dissertation, an analysis of the origins of poetic metre, was published in 1961 as The Founding of English Metre by Columbia University Press (New York) and Routledge and Kegan Paul (London). It was reprinted in 1966 by Columbia with an introduction by John Hollander. Career As early as 1952 Thompson began publishing scholarly articles in Partisan Review and Hudson Review which brought him to the attention of the New York literary circle. (Saunders p. 241). Thompson was hired as Executive Director of the Farfield Foundation, a CIA-funded organization which gave small grants to third world writers and intellectuals. He worked there from 1956 until 1965, frequently traveling to Africa (Saunders p. 137-138). He continued publishing literary criticism and essays and stories during this time and throughout his life in numerous journals including Poetry Magazine, The Kenyon Review, The New York Review of Books, Commentary, Harper's, The New York Times Book Review, Parnassus, Shenandoah (magazine), and The American Scholar (magazine). (See Bibliography.) After leaving Farfield, Thompson was hired as full Professor of English Literature at Stony Brook University in 1965. He retired in 1983. Personal life Thompson met his first wife, Helen Louise Keeler (Dilly), when he was home on furlough in 1944. She was a Grand Rapids native, and a recent graduate in the first graduating class of Bennington College who was teaching at Grand Rapids Art School. They married in June 1944, three months after they met. After the war, they moved to New York so that Thompson could do his graduate work at Columbia. They had three children, Louise Steketee Thompson, Keeler George Thompson, and Peter Spaulding Thompson, who was named after his close friend, Peter Taylor (writer). Peter died in a car accident at nineteen in 1972. Thompson and his wife were divorced in 1962. Thompson married Susan Otis in 1963. Susan Otis Thompson later studied at Columbia University School of Library Service where she obtained her Ph.D. and taught until her retirement. Her dissertation, American Book Design and William Morris, was published in 1977 by R.R. Bowker. Thompson died in New York at his home in Manhattan on June 24, 2002 at the age of eighty-three.

Although he never won a Group 1 race he was rated at his peak as one of the best middle distance horses in the world. He was variously described by the men who rode him as \\"quirky\\", \\"a bit of a monkey\\" and \\"a lazy little devil\\". After winning one minor race as a juvenile in 2005 he improved in the following year to win the Chester Vase and the King Edward VII Stakes. He was even better in 2007 when he took the Princess of Wales's Stakes and the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. In 2008, as a five-year-old he failed to win a race but produced a career-best performance when narrowly beaten by Duke of Marmalade in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He made very little impact as a breeding stallion. Background Papal Bull is a bay horse with a narrow white blaze bred in England by B H & C F D Simpson. As a foal in November 2003 the colt was offered for sale at Tattersalls and was bought for 20,000 guineas by Highfort Stud. A year later he was returned to the Tattersalls auction ring and was sold for 100,000 guineas to the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne, who was acting on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore Stud. Unlike the majority of Coolmore's best horses which are trained at Ballydoyle, Papal Bull was sent into training with Michael Stoute at the Freemason Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Montjeu whose wins included the Prix du Jockey Club, Irish Derby, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. As a breeding stallion his other progeny included Motivator, Authorized, Pour Moi, Camelot, Scorpion, Masked Marvel, Hurricane Fly, St Nicholas Abbey and Hurricane Run. Papal Bull's dam Mialuna was an unraced daughter of Mamaluna, a mare who won the Nassau Stakes and finished third in the Epsom Oaks. As a descendant of the American broodmare June Rose (foaled 1916) Mamaluna was distantly related to Creator and Mecca's Angel. Racing career=2005: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut Papal Bull started at odds of 6/1 for a minor race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse 3 September and finished fourth of the eight runners. Later that month at Salisbury Racecourse he started odds on favourite for a maiden race but after disputing the lead for most of the way he was beaten one and a half lengths into second place by Botteen. At Leicester Racecourse on 11 October the colt was ridden by Kieren Fallon and started 8/13 favourite for a maiden. He led from the start and won by two lengths from Cousteau despite being eased down in the final strides. =2006: three-year-old season= Papal Bull began his second campaign in a ten furlong handicap race at Newmarket on 20 April in which he carried 130 pounds and started the 5/1 second choice in the betting. He was restrained by Fallon before taking the lead and winning by one and a quarter lengths from Linas Selection and eight others. On 11 May, the colt was stepped up in class and distance for the Group 3 Chester Vase (a trial race for the Epsom Derby) over one and a half miles at Chester Racecourse and started 6/4 favourite ahead of the Sandown Classic Trial winner Primary. Ridden by Fallon he started slowly but moved up to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Dragon Dancer. Stoute described the winner as \\"still a bit babyish\\" whereas Fallon was more enthusiastic, saying \\"he'll look better on a galloping track. He has a great attitude, he's improving with racing, and he has shown he stays\\". On 3 June Papal Bull started at odds of 11/1 in an eighteen-runner field for the 2006 Epsom Derby. He looked to be making good progress on the inside in the straight but was badly hampered two furlongs out and came home tenth behind Sir Percy. Three weeks later at Royal Ascot the colt was partnered by Fallon in the King Edward VII Stakes and started the 5/4 favourite ahead of eight opponents including Youmzain, Sixties Icon and Red Rocks. After tracking the leaders he went to front approaching the final furlong and held off the challenge of Red Rocks to win by a neck. Fallon commented \\"I thought he was going to do it easier but he's obviously a lazy little devil. He's got a big future, he's a playboy but great to ride. He's a natural and does everything for you\\". At York Racecourse in August Papal Bull started favourite for the Great Voltigeur Stakes, a major trial for the St Leger, but ran poorly and finished unplaced in a race won by Youmzain. The colt was then sent to France for the Prix Niel over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 10 September. He was in second place for most of race but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fifth of the seven runners behind Rail Link. In the 2006 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings Papal Bull was rated the 130th best racehorse in the world. =2007: four-year-old season= Papal Bull was well beaten on his first two starts as a four-year-old finishing fourth to Sixties Icon in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket on 6 May and then running fifth behind Take A Bow in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown Park later that month. Ryan Moore took the ride when the colt started at odds of 11/1 for the Group 2 Princess of Wales's Stakes over one and a half miles on good to firm ground at Newmarket on 12 July. Sixties Icon started favourite while the other ten runners included Lucarno and Laverock (Prix d'Ispahan). After being restrained by Moore in the early stages he began to make progress approaching the final quarter mile and took the lead a furlong out. Despite hanging left and then right in the closing stages he kept on well to win by two and a half lengths from Laverock. After the race Stoute said \\"He's been a very, very consistent horse but we were baffled after he ran at Sandown but he wasn't right afterwards\\". In August Papal Bull was moved up in distance for the Geoffrey Freer Stakes over thirteen and a half furlongs at Newbury Racecourse and started the 6/4 favourite ahead of Classic Punch (Fred Archer Stakes). Ridden by Moore, he took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths from Shahin. Moore commented \\"He's got his quirks, but you've just got to let him get on with it. If he wants to do it, he will\\". At the same track in September he started favourite for the Dubai Duty Free Arc Trial over eleven furlongs but despite a strong late run he finished third, beaten a neck and a short head by Halicarnassus and Soapy Danger. For his final run of the year the colt was sent to Tokyo Racecourse to contest the Japan Cup on 25 November and went off a 51/1 outsider in an eighteen-runner field. He tarted lowly and never looked likely to win but stayed on well in the straight to finish seventh, five lengths behind the winner Admire Moon. Papal Bull's rating of 116 in the 2007 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings made him the 112th best racehorse in the world. =2008: five-year-old season= In early 2008 the horse's ownership passed to the Papal Bull Syndicate. On his first run as a five-year-old Papal Bull contested the Coronation Cup at Epsom Racecourse on 6 June and came home fourth of the eleven runners behind Soldier of Fortune, Youmzain and Macarthur. On 10 July he was made the 2/1 favourite as he attempted to repeat his 2007 success in the Princess of Wales's Stakes but was beaten into second place by Lucarno having struggled to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile. Sixteen day after his defeat at Newmarket, Papal Bull started a 14/1 outsider for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot and was ridden by Olivier Peslier in what proved to be the best performance of the horse's career. After being restrained at the rear of the eight-runner field he was switched to the outside and swept past his rivals, overtaking the odds- on favourite Duke of Marmalade to take the lead inside the final furlong. Duke of Marmalade however, rallied in the final strides, regained the advantage and won by half a length. There was a gap of nine lengths back to Youmzain in third while the other beaten horses included Lucarno, Ask and Macarthur. When interviewed after the race Peslier smiled, shrugged and commented \\"He is good, and a bit of a monkey too. Another time, I come even later. Maybe I even win\\". In August Papal Bull was sent to Germany and started 4/9 favourite for the Rheinland-Pokal over 2400 metres but finished a distant third behind Oriental Tiger and Kamsin. He was later promoted to second as the \\"winner\\" failed a dope test. On 5 October he ran in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse but made no impression as he came home twelfth behind Zarkava. Papal Bull ended his racing career on 30 November with a second crack at the Japan Cup but ran unplaced behind Screen Hero beaten eight lengths by the winner. In the 2008 World Thoroughbred Rankings Papal Bull was given a rating of 124, making him the thirteenth-best racehorse in the world. Stud career At the end of his racing career Papal Bull was retired to become a breeding stallion. He sired numerous minor winners both on the flat and over jumps but no top-class performers.

Members of the church are encouraged to be active participants in their community, and as a result of this they have contributed in a variety of ways to events throughout the twentieth century. As different wars were fought in the 1900s the involvement of the church and its members has been substantial as the members often participated in the armed forces and the church has sought to give guidance to its members living both in the United States or in other countries around the world.  World War I  Participation Latter-day Saints in World War I can be shown by direct member involvement and the effects that the war had on the church as a whole. = Member involvement = Joseph F. Smith was the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during World War I Joseph F. Smith was the president of the LDS Church during the time of World War 1. Even though he was an advocate for peace, when the United States entered WWI by declaring war on Germany, Smith supported the cause. He supported patriotism and responsibility, and pertaining to the two he once said, \\"a good Latter-Day Saint is a good citizen in every way.\\" Smith showed this support by providing Latter-day Saint chaplains for active duty military units. This was the first time that the United States Military allowed the LDS Church to directly select active duty member chaplains, and they have continued to allow this practice to the present day. The first three LDS chaplains selected by the church were Calvin Schwartz Smith, Herbert B. Maw, and B. H. Roberts. Even though there were only three chaplains for the 15,000 LDS members in the war, these men labored diligently to contribute to the war effort by religiously strengthening the LDS soldiers.Mangum, James I. ‚ÄúThe Influence of the First World War on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.‚Äù Brigham Young University, 2007. Members of the LDS Church also contributed to the war on the homefront. Latter-day Saints along with the rest of the Americans were encouraged by national and local leaders to live more frugally during the war. The United States war effort required a lot of food and supplies for its soldiers, which caused shortages in supplies among Americans. Local LDS leaders began teaching a more thrifty way of living, which taught LDS members how to have what they needed even with the decrease in resources. Latter-Day Saints also practiced controlled conservation of their food and resources in order to contribute to the needs of the U.S. military. Members encouraged food production, used less fuel, purchased war bonds, and contributed supplies to show support for the war and their soldiers. = Effects on the Church = Joseph F. Smith and other church members had many concerns about the entrance of the United States into the war. Smith quickly began organizing the removal of Latter-day Saint missionaries from Europe. He considered evacuation as a necessary step to ensure the safety of the American church missionaries. This was a major set- back in LDS missionary work as LDS missionaries could no longer proselytize in European countries, but the war provided a new way for members to share their beliefs. Within the ranks of the U.S. forces, church members were able to tell fellow soldiers about their religion as well show them that Latter-day Saints did have feelings of national loyalty, as many Americans believed the LDS Church to be against nationalism. Many LDS soldiers were killed in the conflict overseas, and were greatly mourned along with the other lost American lives. Also causing large casualties during this time was the influenza epidemic in Europe. WWI soldiers lived in close quarters, where germs were rapidly spread. The influenza disease was underestimated at first, but caused the death of hundreds of soldiers on all sides of the war, LDS soldiers included. Throughout World War I, approximately 700 Latter-day Saint soldiers lost their lives from either warfare or disease.  World War II  Involvement of this community during World War II can be categorized in two ways: Church involvement as a whole, and the involvement of individual members. Effects on the church are generally much more broad, but individual members participated in the war effort in their own ways. = Member involvement = Many members of the church served during World War II as members of the armed forces, and 45 different members served as chaplains during World War II. Many of them received awards for their service and acts during the war, including two who received Silver Stars, four who received Bronze Stars, and one who was awarded a Purple Heart. Members in countries other than the United States also participated in this conflict in vastly different ways. A particularly noteworthy example is that of Helmuth H√ºbener, a German youth who opposed the Nazi Regime by writing and distributing pamphlets with anti‚ÄìNational Socialist material. He was later arrested and executed. Other German members of the church were drafted into the army, and some enlisted of their own accord.Hansen, Lynn M, and Faith D Hansen. ‚ÄúSurviving by Faith: German Latter-Day Saints and World War II.‚Äù BYU Studies Quarterly, vol. 51, no. 2, 2012. Many German church members also said that the years of the war were very difficult, but they also said that many of the hardships they experienced strengthened their faith. = Effects on the Church = Members of the LDS Church believe that they have the \\"duty to preach the gospel\\" (or in other words, share their beliefs) to the world. As a result of this belief, many members choose to serve full time proselytizing missions in certain areas assigned to them by leaders of the church. As tensions rose in Europe before the start of World War II the United States issued a warning to all citizens living abroad, especially in Germany, to leave Europe for their own protection. This directly affected missionaries for the church as most of them originated from within the States. On August 24, 1939, the church removed any missionaries that were in Europe in order to preserve their safety. In August of the following year, missionaries were evacuated from South-African and Pacific areas and later South America. As conflict increased and the US officially entered the war, the church made official statements encouraging its members to serve their country in the armed forces.

Both types of privacy fall under the umbrella of information privacy. Privacy concerns regarding search engines can take many forms, such as the ability for search engines to log individual search queries, browsing history, IP addresses, and cookies of users, and conducting user profiling in general. The collection of personally identifiable information of users by search engines is referred to as \\"tracking\\".Pekala, Shayna. 2017. ‚ÄúPrivacy and User Experience in 21st Century Library Discovery.‚Äù Information Technology and Libraries36(2):48‚Äì58. This is controversial because search engines often claim to collect a user's data in order to tailor better results to that specific user and provide the user with a better searching experience. However, search engines can also abuse and compromise its users' privacy by selling their data to advertisers for profit. In the absence of regulations, users must decide what is more important to their search engine experience: relevance and speed of results or their privacy, and choose a search engine accordingly.Lenard, Thomas M. and Paul H. Rubin. 2010. ‚ÄúIn Defense of Data: Information and the Costs of Privacy.‚Äù Policy & Internet2(1):1‚Äì56.

An Originalist Interpretation of the Fourth Amendment in Online Communication Cases.‚Äù Berkeley Technology Law Journal22(1):447‚Äì75. The most popular search engines collect personal information, but other search engines that are focused on privacy have cropped up recently. There have been several well publicized breaches of search engine user privacy that occurred with companies like AOL and Yahoo. For individuals interested in preserving their privacy, there are options available to them, such as using software like Tor which makes the user's location and personal information anonymousRidgway, Renee. 2017. ‚ÄúAgainst a Personalisation of the Self.‚Äù Ephemera: Theory & Politics in Organization17(2):377‚Äì97. or using a privacy focused search engine.  Privacy policies  Search engines generally publish privacy policies to inform users about what data of theirs may be collected and what purposes it may be used for. While these policies may be an attempt at transparency by search engines, many people never read themStrahilevitz, Lior Jacob and Matthew B. Kugler. 2016. \\"Is Privacy Policy Language Irrelevant to Consumers?\\" The Journal of Legal Studies45(S2). and are therefore unaware of how much of their private information, like passwords and saved files, are collected from cookies and may be logged and kept by the search engine.Dolin, Ron A. 2010. ‚ÄúSearch Query Privacy: The Problem of Anonymization.‚Äù Hastings Science and Technology Law Journal2(2):137‚Äì82.Nissenbaum, Helen. 2011. ‚ÄúA Contextual Approach to Privacy Online.‚Äù Daedalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences140(4):32‚Äì48. This ties in with the phenomenon of notice and consent, which is how many privacy policies are structured. Notice and consent policies essentially consist of a site showing the user a privacy policy and having them click to agree. This is intended to let the user freely decide whether or not to go ahead and use the website. This decision, however, may not actually be made so freely because the costs of opting out can be very high.Tene, Omer. 2008. ‚ÄúWhat Google Knows: Privacy and Internet Search Engines.‚Äù Utah Law Review2008(4):1433‚Äì92. Another big issue with putting the privacy policy in front of users and having them accept quickly is that they are often very hard to understand, even in the unlikely case that a user decides to read them. Privacy minded search engines, such as DuckDuckGo, state in their privacy policies that they collect much less data than search engines such as Google or Yahoo, and may not collect any. As of 2008, search engines were not in the business of selling user data to third parties, though they do note in their privacy policies that they comply with government subpoenas. = Google and Yahoo = Google, founded in 1998, is the most widely used search engine, receiving billions and billions of search queries every month. Google logs all search terms in a database along with the date and time of search, browser and operating system, IP address of user, the Google cookie, and the URL that shows the search engine and search query.Church, Peter and Georgina Kon. 2007. ‚ÄúGoogle at the Heart of a Data Protection Storm.‚Äù Computer Law & Security Report23(5):461‚Äì65. The privacy policy of Google states that they pass user data on to various affiliates, subsidiaries, and \\"trusted\\" business partners. Yahoo, founded in 1995, also collects user data. It is a well-known fact that users do not read privacy policies, even for services that they use daily, such as Yahoo! Mail and Gmail. This persistent failure of consumers to read these privacy policies can be disadvantageous to them because while they may not pick up on differences in the language of privacy policies, judges in court cases certainly do. This means that search engine and email companies like Google and Yahoo are technically able to keep up the practice of targeting advertisements based on email content since they declare that they do so in their privacy policies. A study was done to see how much consumers cared about privacy policies of Google, specifically Gmail, and their detail, and it determined that users often thought that Google's practices were somewhat intrusive but that users would not often be willing to counteract this by paying a premium for their privacy. = DuckDuckGo = DuckDuckGo, founded in 2008, is known for being privacy focused and not tracking its users.Hands, Africa. 2012. ‚ÄúDuckduckgo http://www.duckduckgo.comor http://www.ddg.gg.‚ÄùTechnical Services Quarterly29(4): 345-347.Allen, Jeffrey and Ashley Hallene. 2018. ‚ÄúPrivacy and Security Tips for Avoiding Financial Chaos.‚Äù American Journal of Family Law101‚Äì7. DuckDuckGo does not collect or share any personal information of users, such as IP addresses or cookies, which other search engines usually do log and keep for some time. It also does not have spam, and protects user privacy further by anonymizing search queries from the website the user chooses and using encryption. Similarly privacy oriented search engines include StartPage and Disconnect.  Types of data collected by search engines  Most search engines can, and do, collect personal information about their users according to their own privacy policies. This user data could be anything from location information to cookies, IP addresses, search query histories, click-through history, and online fingerprints.Wicker, J√∂rg and Stefan Kramer. 2017. ‚ÄúThe Best Privacy Defense Is a Good Privacy Offense: Obfuscating a Search Engine User‚Äôs Profile.‚Äù Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery31(5):1419‚Äì43.Squitieri, Chad. 2015. ‚ÄúCONFRONTING BIG DATA: APPLYING THE CONFRONTATION CLAUSE TO GOVERNMENT DATA COLLECTION.‚Äù Virginia Law Review101(7):2011‚Äì49. This data is often stored in large databases, and users may be assigned numbers in an attempt to provide them with anonymity. Data can be stored for an extended period of time. For example, the data collected by Google on its users is retained for up to 9 months.Viejo, Alexandre and Jordi Castell√†-Roca. 2010. ‚ÄúUsing Social Networks to Distort Users‚Äô Profiles Generated by Web Search Engines.‚Äù Computer Networks 54(9):1343‚Äì57.Evans, David S. n.d. ‚ÄúThe Online Advertising Industry: Economics, Evolution, and Privacy.‚Äù The Journal of Economic Perspectives23(3):37‚Äì60. Some studies state that this number is actually 18 months.Chiru, Claudiu. 2016. ‚ÄúSEARCH ENGINES: ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS.‚Äù Economics, Management, and Financial Markets11(1):162‚Äì67. This data is used for various reasons such as optimizing and personalizing search results for users, targeting advertising, and trying to protect users from scams and phishing attacks. Such data can be collected even when a user is not logged in to their account or when using a different IP address by using cookies. = Uses = User profiling and personalization  What search engines often do once they have collected information about a user's habits is create a profile of them, which helps the search engine decide which links to show for different search queries submitted by that user or which ads to target them with. An interesting development in this field is the invention of automated learning, also known as machine learning. Using this, search engines can refine their profiling models to more accurately predict what any given user may want to click on by doing A/B testing of results offered to users and measuring the reactions of users.van Otterlo, Martijn. 2014. ‚ÄúAutomated Experimentation in Walden 3.0. : The Next Step in Profiling, Predicting, Control and Surveillance.‚Äù Surveillance & Society 12(2):255‚Äì72. Companies like Google, Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon have all started personalizing results more and more. One notable example is how Google Scholar takes into account the publication history of a user in order to produce results it deems relevant. Personalization also occurs when Amazon recommends books or when IMDb suggests movies by using previously collected information about a user to predict their tastes. For personalization to occur, a user need not even be logged into their account.  Targeted advertising  The internet advertising company DoubleClick, which helps advertisers target users for specific ads, was bought by Google in 2008 and was a subsidiary until June 2018, when Google rebranded and merged DoubleClick into its Google Marketing Platform. DoubleClick worked by depositing cookies on user's computers that would track sites they visited with DoubleClick ads on them. There was a privacy concern when Google was in the process of acquiring DoubleClick that the acquisition would let Google create even more comprehensive profiles of its users since they would be collecting data about search queries and additionally tracking websites visited. This could lead to users being shown ads that are increasingly effective with the use of behavioral targeting. With more effective ads comes the possibility of more purchases from consumers that they may not have made otherwise. In 1994, a conflict between selling ads and relevance of results on search engines began.  Improving search quality  Besides ad targeting and personalization, Google also uses data collected on users to improve the quality of searches. Search result click histories and query logs are crucial in helping search engines optimize search results for individual users. Search logs also help search engines in the development of the algorithms they use to return results, such as Google's well known PageRank. An example of this is how Google uses databases of information to refine Google Spell Checker. = Privacy organizations = There are many who believe that user profiling is a severe invasion of user privacy, and there are organizations such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Privacy International that are focused on advocating for user privacy rights. In fact, EPIC filed a complaint in 2007 with the Federal Trade Commission claiming that Google should not be able to acquire DoubleClick on the grounds that it would compromise user privacy.  Users' perception of privacy  Experiments have been done to examine consumer behavior when given information on the privacy of retailers by integrating privacy ratings with search engines.Tsai, Janice Y., Serge Egelman, Lorrie Cranor, and Alessandro Acquisti. 2011. ‚ÄúThe Effect of Online Privacy Information on Purchasing Behavior: An Experimental Study.‚Äù Information Systems Research22(2):254‚Äì68. Researchers used a search engine for the treatment group called Privacy Finder, which scans websites and automatically generates an icon to show the level of privacy the site will give the consumer as it compares to the privacy policies that consumer has specified that they prefer. The results of the experiment were that subjects in the treatment group, those who were using a search engine that indicated privacy levels of websites, purchased products from websites that gave them higher levels of privacy, whereas the participants in the control groups opted for the products that were simply the cheapest. The study participants also were given financial incentive because they would get to keep leftover money from purchases. This study suggests that since participants had to use their own credit cards, they had a significant aversion to purchasing products from sites that did not offer the level of privacy they wanted, indicating that consumers value their privacy monetarily.  Ethical debates  Many individuals and scholars have recognized the ethical concerns regarding search engine privacy. = Pro data collection = The collection of user data by search engines can be viewed as a positive practice because it allows the search engine to personalize results. This implies that users would receive more relevant results, and be shown more relevant advertisements, when their data, such as past search queries, location information, and clicks, is used to create a profile for them. Also, search engines are generally free of charge for users and can remain afloat because one of their main sources of revenue is advertising, which can be more effective when targeted. = Anti-data collection = This collection of user data can also be seen as an overreach by private companies for their own financial gain or as an intrusive surveillance tactic. Search engines can make money using targeted advertising because advertisers are willing to pay a premium to present their ads to the most receptive consumers. Also, when a search engine collects and catalogs large amounts of data about its users, there is the potential for it to be leaked accidentally or breached. The government can also subpoena user data from search engines when they have databases of it. Search query database information may also be subpoenaed by private litigants for use in civil cases, such as divorces or employment disputes.  Data and privacy breaches = AOL search data leak = One major controversy regarding search engine privacy was the AOL search data leak of 2006. For academic and research purposes, AOL made public a list of about 20 million search queries made by about 650,000 unique users. Although they assigned unique identification numbers to the users instead of attaching names to each query, it was still possible to ascertain the true identities of many users simply by analyzing what they had searched, including locations near them and names of friends and family members. A notable example of this was how the New York Times identified Thelma Arnold through \\"reverse searching\\". Users also sometimes do \\"ego searches\\" where they search themselves to see what information about them is on the internet, making it even easier to identify supposedly anonymous users. Many of the search queries released by AOL were incriminating or seemingly extremely private, such as \\"how to kill your wife\\" and \\"can you adopt after a suicide attempt\\". This data has since been used in several experiments that attempt to measure the effectiveness of user privacy solutions.P√†mies-Estrems, David, Jordi Castell√†-Roca, and Alexandre Viejo. 2016. ‚ÄúWorking at the Web Search Engine Side to Generate Privacy-Preserving User Profiles.‚Äù Expert Systems with Applications64:523‚Äì35. = Google and Yahoo = Both Google and Yahoo were subjects of a Chinese hack in 2010.Trautman, Lawrence J. and Peter C. Ormerod. 2016. ‚ÄúCORPORATE DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' CYBERSECURITY STANDARD OF CARE: THE YAHOO DATA BREACH.‚Äù SSRN Electronic Journal66(5). While Google responded to the situation seriously by hiring new cybersecurity engineers and investing heavily into securing user data, Yahoo took a much more lax approach. Google started paying hackers to find vulnerabilities in 2010 while it took Yahoo until 2013 to follow suit. Yahoo was also identified in the Snowden data leaks as a common hacking target for spies of various nations, and Yahoo still did not give its newly hired chief information security officer the resources to really effect change within the company. In 2012, Yahoo hired Marissa Mayer, previously a Google employee, to be the new CEO, but she chose not to invest much in the security infrastructure of Yahoo and went as far as to refuse the implementation of a basic and standard security measure to force the reset of all passwords after a breach. Yahoo is known for being the subject of multiple breaches and hacks that have compromised large amounts of user data. As of late 2016, Yahoo had announced that at least 1.5 billion user accounts had been breached during 2013 and 2014. The breach of 2013 compromised over a billion accounts while the breach of 2014 included about 500 million accounts. The data compromised in the breaches included personally identifiable information such as phone numbers, email addresses, and birth dates as well as information like security questions (used to reset passwords) and encrypted passwords. Yahoo made a statement saying that their breaches were a result of state sponsored actors, and in 2017, two Russian intelligence officers were indicted by the United States Department of Justice as part of a conspiracy to hack Yahoo and steal user data. As of 2016, the Yahoo breaches of 2013 and 2014 were the largest of all time. In October 2018, there was a Google+ data breach that potentially affected about 500,000 accounts which led to the shutdown of the Google+ platform. = Government subpoenas of data = The government may want to subpoena user data from search engines for any number of reasons, which is why it a big threat to user privacy. In 2006, they wanted it as part of their defense of COPA, and only Google refused to comply. While protecting the online privacy of children may be an honorable goal, there are concerns about whether the government should have access to such personal data to achieve it. At other times, they may want it for national security purposes; access to big databases of search queries in order to prevent terrorist attacks is a common example of this. Whatever the reason, it is clear that the fact that search engines do create and maintain these databases of user data is what makes it possible for the government to access it. Another concern regarding government access to search engine user data is \\"function creep,\\" a term that here refers to how data originally collected by the government for national security purposes may eventually be used for other purposes, such as debt collection. This would indicate to many a government overreach. While protections for search engine user privacy have started developing recently, the government has increasingly been on the side that wants to ensure search engines retain data, making users less protected and their data more available for anyone to subpoena.  Methods for increasing privacy = Switching search engines = A different, although popular, route for a privacy centered user to take is to simply start using a privacy oriented search engine, such as DuckDuckGo. This search engine maintains the privacy of its users by not collecting data on or tracking its users. While this may sound simple, users must take into account the trade-off between privacy and relevant results when deciding to switch search engines. Results to search queries can be very different when the search engine has no search history to aid it in personalization. = Using privacy oriented browsers = Mozilla is known for its beliefs in protecting user privacy on Firefox. Mozilla Firefox users have the capability to delete the tracking cookie that Google places on their computer, making it much harder for Google to group data. Firefox also has a button called \\"Clear Private Data\\" which allows users to be more in control of their settings. Internet Explorer users have this option as well. When using a browser like Google Chrome or Safari, users also have the option to browse in \\"incognito\\" or \\"private browsing\\" modes respectively. When in these modes, the user's browsing history and cookies are not collected. = Opting out = The Google, Yahoo!, AOL, and MSN search engines all allow users to opt out of the behavioral targeting they use. Users can also delete search and browsing history at any time. The Ask.com search engine also has AskEraser, which, when used, purges user data from their servers. Deleting a user's profile and history of data from search engine logs also helps protect user privacy in the event a government agency wants to subpoena it. If there are no records, there is nothing the government can access. It is important to note that simply deleting your browsing history does not delete all the information the search engine has on you, some companies do not delete the data associated with your account when you clear your browsing history. For companies that do delete user data, they usually do not delete all of it keeping records of how you used the search engine. = Social network solution = An innovative solution, proposed by researchers Viejo and Castell√†-Roca, is a social network solution whereby user profiles are distorted. In their plan, each user would belong to a group, or network, of people who all use the search engine. Every time somebody wanted to submit a search query, it would be passed on to another member of the group to submit on their behalf until someone submitted it. This would ideally lead to all search queries being divvied up equally between all members of the network. This way, the search engine cannot make a useful profile of any individual user in the group since it has no way to discern which query actually belonged to each user. = Delisting and reordering = After the Google Spain v. AEPD case, it was established that people had the right to request that search engines delete personal information from their search results in compliance with other European data protection regulations. This process of simply removing certain search results is called de-listing.de Mars, Sylvia and Patrick O'Callaghan. 2016. \\"Privacy and Search Engines: Forgetting or Contextualizing?\\"¬ù Journal of Law and Society43(2):257‚Äì84. While effective in protecting the privacy of those who wish information about them to not be accessed by anyone using a search engine, it does not necessarily protect the contextual integrity of search results. For data that is not highly sensitive or compromising, reordering search results is another option where people would be able to rank how relevant certain data is at any given point in time, which would then alter results given when someone searched their name. = Anonymity networks = A sort of DIY option for privacy minded users is to use a software like Tor, which is an anonymity network. Tor functions by encrypting user data and routing queries through thousands of relays. While this process is effective at masking IP addresses, it can slow the speed of results. While Tor may work to mask IP addresses, there have also been studies that show that a simulated attacker software could still match search queries to users even when anonymized using Tor.Petit, Albin et al. 2016. ‚ÄúSimAttack: Private Web Search under Fire.‚Äù Journal of Internet Services and Applications 7(2):1‚Äì17.Peddinti, Sai Teja and Nitesh Saxena. 2014. ‚ÄúWeb Search Query Privacy: Evaluating Query Obfuscation and Anonymizing Networks.‚Äù Journal of Computer Security22(1):155‚Äì99. = Unlinkability and indistinguishability = Unlinkability and indistinguishability are also well-known solutions to search engine privacy, although they have proven somewhat ineffective in actually providing users with anonymity from their search queries. Both unlinkability and indistinguishability solutions try to anonymize search queries from the user who made them, therefore making it impossible for the search engine to definitively link a specific query with a specific user and create a useful profile on them. This can be done in a couple of different ways.  Unlinkability  Another way for the user to hide information such as their IP address from the search engine, which is an unlinkability solution. This is perhaps more simple and easy for the user because any user can do this by using a VPN, although it still does not guarantee total privacy from the search engine.  Indistinguishability  One way is for the user to use a plugin or software that generates multiple different search queries for every real search query the user makes. This is an indistinguishability solution, and it functions by obscuring the real searches a user makes so that a search engine cannot tell which queries are the software's and which are the user's. Then, it is more difficult for the search engine to use the data it collects on a user to do things like target ads.  Legal rights and court cases  Being that the internet and search engines are relatively recent creations, no solid legal framework for privacy protections in terms of search engines has been put in place. However, scholars do write about the implications of existing laws on privacy in general to inform what right to privacy search engine users have. As this is a developing field of law, there have been several lawsuits with respect to the privacy search engines are expected to afford to their users. = United States = The Fourth Amendment  Main article: The Fourth Amendment The Fourth Amendment is well known for the protections it offers citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures, but in Katz v. United States (1967), these protections were extended to cover intrusions of privacy of individuals, in addition to simply intrusion of property and people. Privacy of individuals is a broad term, but it is not hard to imagine that it includes the online privacy of an individual.  The Sixth Amendment  Main article: The Sixth Amendment The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is applicable to the protection of big data from government surveillance. The Confrontation Clause essentially states that defendants in criminal cases have the right to confront witnesses who provide testimonial statements. If a search engine company like Google gives information to the government to prosecute a case, these witnesses are the Google employees involved in the process of selecting which data to hand over to the government. The specific employees who must be available to be confronted under the Confrontation Clause are the producer who decides what data is relevant and provides the government with what they've asked for, the Google analyst who certifies the proper collection and transmission of data, and the custodian who keeps records. The data these employees of Google curate for trial use is then thought of as testimonial statement. The overall effectiveness of the Confrontation Clause on search engine privacy is that it places a check on how the government can use big data and provides defendants with protection from human error.  Katz v. United States  Main article: Katz v. United States This 1967 case is prominent because it established a new interpretation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, specifically that people had a reasonable expectation of it. Katz v. United States was about whether or not it was constitutional for the government to listen to and record, electronically using a pen register, a conversation Katz had from a public phone booth. The court ruled that it did violate the Fourth Amendment because the actions of the government were considered a \\"search\\" and that the government needed a warrant. When thinking about search engine data collected about users, the way telephone communications were classified under Katz v. United States could be a precedent for how it should be handled. In Katz v. United States, public telephones were deemed to have a \\"vital role\\" in private communications. This case took place in 1967, but surely nowadays, the internet and search engines have this vital role in private communications, and people's search queries and IP addresses can be thought of as analogous to the private phone calls placed from public booths.  United States v. Miller  Main article: United States v. Miller This 1976 Supreme Court case is relevant to search engine privacy because the court ruled that when third parties gathered or had information given to them, the Fourth Amendment was not applicable. Jayni Foley argues that the ruling of United States v. Miller implies that people cannot have an expectation of privacy when they provide information to third parties. When thinking about search engine privacy, this is important because people willingly provide search engines with information in the form of their search queries and various other data points that they may not realize are being collected.  Smith v. Maryland  Main article: Smith v. Maryland In the Supreme Court case Smith v. Maryland of 1979, the Supreme Court went off the precedent set in the 1976 United States v. Miller case about assumption of risk. The court ruled that the Fourth Amendment did not prevent the government from monitoring who dialed which phone numbers by using a pen register because it did not qualify as a \\"search\\". Both the United States v. Miller and the Smith v. Maryland cases have been used to prevent users from the privacy protections offered under the Fourth Amendment from the records that internet service providers (ISPs) keep. This is also articulated in the Sixth Circuit Guest v. Leis case as well as the United States v. Kennedy case where the courts ruled that Fourth Amendment protections did not apply to ISP customer data since they willingly provided ISPs with their information just by using the services of ISPs. Similarly, the current legal structure regarding privacy and assumption of risk can be interpreted to mean that users of search engines cannot expect privacy in regards to the data they communicate by using search engines.  Electronic Communication Privacy Act  The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 was passed by Congress in an effort to start creating a legal structure for privacy protections in the face of new forms of technologies, although it was by no means comprehensive because there are considerations for current technologies that Congress never imagined in 1986 and could account for. The EPCA does little to regulate ISPs and mainly prevents government agencies from gathering information stored by ISPs without a warrant. What the EPCA does not do, unsurprisingly because it was enacted before internet usage became a common occurrence, is say anything about search engine privacy and the protections users are afforded in terms of their search queries.  Gonzales v. Google Inc.  The background of this 2006 case is that the government was trying to bolster its defense for the Child Online Protection Act (COPA). It was doing a study to see how effective its filtering software was in regards to child pornography. To do this, the government subpoenaed search data from Google, AOL, Yahoo!, and Microsoft to use in its analysis and to show that people search information that is potentially compromising to children. This search data that the government wanted included both the URLs that appeared to users and the actual search queries of users. Of the search engines the government subpoenaed to produce search queries and URLs, only Google refused to comply with the government, even after the request was reduced in size. Google itself claimed that handing over these logs was to hand over personally identifiable information and user identities. The court ruled that Google had to hand over 50,000 randomly selected URLs to the government but not search queries because that could seed public distrust of the company and therefore compromise its business.  Law of Confidentiality  While not a strictly defined law enacted by Congress, the Law of Confidentiality is common law that protects information shared by a party who has trust and an expectation of privacy from the party they share the information with. If the content of search queries and the logs they are stored in is thought of in the same manner as information shared with a physician, as it is similarly confidential, then it ought to be afforded the same privacy protections. = Europe = Google Spain v. AEPD  Main article: Google Spain v. AEPD The European Court of Justice ruled in 2014 that its citizens had the \\"Right to Be Forgotten\\" in the Google Spain SL v. Agencia Espa√±ola de Protecci√≥n de Datos case, which meant that they had the right to demand search engines wipe any data collected on them. While this single court decision did not directly establish the \\"right to be forgotten\\", the court interpreted existing law to mean that people had the right to request that some information about them be wiped from search results provided by search engine companies like Google. The background of this case is that one Spanish citizen, Mario Costeja Gonzalez, set out to erase himself from Google's search results because they revealed potentially compromising information about his past debts. In the ruling in favor of Mario Costeja Gonzalez, the court noted that search engines can significantly impact the privacy rights of many people and that Google controlled the dissemination of personal data. This court decision did not claim that all citizens should be able to request that information about them be completely wiped from Google at any time, but rather that there are specific types of information, particularly information that is obstructing one's right to be forgotten, that do not need to be so easily accessible on search engines.  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  The GDPR is a European regulation that was put in place to protect data and provide privacy to European citizens, regardless of whether they are physically in the European Union. This means that countries around the globe have had to comply with their rules so that any European citizen residing in them is afforded the proper protections. The regulation became enforceable in May 2018.

B. p. 52ff. Life=Provenance and early years= Klementyna Maria Czarkowska-Golejewska was born into a local land owning family in Wysuczka, a small settlement between Lviv and Ternopil in Galicia. This is the where she grew up on her father's family estate, which she later described as \\"a paradise\\". Since 1945 the region has been part of Western Ukraine, but at the time of her birth it was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. During the interwar period it was part of Poland which had been restored to independence after the First World War. Klementyna was the second daughter of Cyryl Czarkowski-Golejewski (1885‚Äì1940) by his marriage to Izabela Jaxa-Ma≈Çachowska (1885‚Äì1958). She herself married at the start of 1933. She and her husband were both 23 when they married, and her husband, Count Andrzej Mankowski (1910‚Äì2001) was still completing his university studies of law and economics at the nearby university. For Klementyna the marriage meant moving away from her own family, to live in the western part of Poland. Andrzej was content to entrust the management of the Mankowski family estate at Winna G√≥ra near Pozna≈Ñ to his young wife. By 1939 they were living there with their two sons. The family were well connected both in Poland and internationally. Andrzej Mankowski had attended the international Benedictine school at Bruges in Belgium between 1922 and 1928, and the staff on the family estate included a German nanny called Teta who took care of the boys. =War= Early in September 1939 war arrived from the west and, sixteen days later, from the east. An early taste of war came to Winna G√≥ra later that month when Lieutenant Andrzej Ma≈Ñkowski (as her husband had by now become) was seriously shot and for the time being immobilised by his own subordinates because he had angrily upbraided a group of Polish soldiers for mistreating a captured German officer in ways that would have offended his own conscience and breached the Geneva Conventions. The German prisoner had been stabbed in the eye with a bayonet. At this stage they were playing host to two \\"old school\\" German officers who had arrived on a couple of motor bikes six days after the launch of the German invasion, and who were surprised to find Klementyna Mankowska and her children ensconced in the castle. Others, elsewhere in the area, had already fled. Beyond the estate, the village was deserted. The officers assured the Ma≈Ñkowskis they would need only one of the three floors of the castle, modestly furnished. There are powerful indications of a brief but intense romance involving one of them. A month later the Gestapo arrived and the family were thrown out of their home at Winna G√≥ra. The castle had been selected as a present/trophy for Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel. One of the German officers, Harold von Hoepfner, proposed a joint trip to Italy in order to protect Klementyna. However, her husband had been badly injured when shot by a Polish soldier under his command, and was still critically ill, by now in a hospital somewhere near Kutno. She turned down von Hoepfner's invitation: \\"I do not think the Wehrmacht officer would want me to give up, for him, a man who stood up heroically in defence of the German soldier\\". Klementyna had resolved to stay with Andrzej, but there was no longer any place for them in their home, so they moved with their children to Warsaw where they stayed with the ballerina Olga S≈Çawska, a family friend. In early October 1939, the Germans captured Warsaw and the Mankowskis moved on to stay with a cousin, Teresa ≈Åubie≈Ñska whose spacious apartment home at \\"ulicy 6 sierpnia\\" (\\"6 Sierpnia Street\\") in the city centre, close to Zbawiciela Square, had become a refuge for well-connected Poles dispossessed by the war. It pulsated with social gatherings. But it quickly became clear that the men who arrived at Cousin Teresa's apartment several evenings each week were not simply party goers. They were members of a newly formed anti-Nazi grouping known as the \\"Muszkieterowie\\" (\\"Musketeers\\"), identified variously as a \\"resistance group\\" (\\"Widerstandsgruppe \\") or as an \\"intelligence organisation\\" (\\"Nachrichtendienstorganisation\\"). The \\"Muszkieterowie\\" recruited mainly from the Polish nobility. Klementyna Mankowska joined. She was a talented linguist and her activities were focused on \\"courier services\\": she smuggled documents, microfilms and messages concealed in rolls of toilet paper to France and Britain. However, that was very far from the full extent of her involvement. The \\"Muszkieterowie\\" were led by Stefan Witkowski an engineer-entrepreneur believed to have had long-standing connections with British intelligence. Details of his contacts are uncertain and remain, eighty years later, controversial: they were conducted independently of the (till June 1940 Paris based) Polish government in exile, and British public archives covering the relationship remain firmly closed to researchers.Cl√©mentine Mankowska: Espionne malgr√© moi, Editions du Rocher, Monaco 1994, z. B. S. 52ff. Witkowski very soon recognised Mankowska's potential and put her in touch with resistance activists Aleksander Wielkopolski and Karol Anders. After this she was included in discussions on the importance of surveillance and of setting up an espionage network. One incident, in particular, convinced Wielkopolski of Mankowska's talent for espionage. The high-ranking German officer Harold von Hoepfner, returning from Milan, turned up unexpectedly in Warsaw to see Klementyna Mankowska. He arrived, en route to Berlin, with flowers, wine, and cheesecake. Listening from an adjacent broom cupboard, Witkowski and Wielkopolski were amazed to hear the brazen combination of grace and charm that Mankowska applied to extracting information from her German friend about an end to the \\"Sitzkrieg\\" in the west, and the forthcoming German invasion of France. (They may or may not have been aware already that von Hoepfner and Mankowska had almost certainly, briefly, been lovers during the early weeks of the war.) The German officer's information had been precise in respect of dates, though he seems to have kept to himself any knowledge he might have had about strategic detailed planning for the invasion. Witkowski nevertheless took the decision to hand over the information he had on the German plans for the invasion of France to British intelligence. Witkowski now embarked on a perilous and lengthy tour of western Europe, using the fake identity of a high-ranking SS-officer called August von Thierbach. His project was nothing less than the creation of an espionage network across Europe. He sent Klementyna Mankowska to Brittany in north-western France. Her mandate was to take charge of communications in the event that the French government should be obliged to escape abroad - presumably to or via Britain. Andrzej and Klementyna Mankowski, like many members of the Polish aristocracy at the time, were both completely fluent in French. Andrzej Mankowski joined the Polish expatriate division in Marseilles while the couple's two sons were placed in the care of Mankowska's mother, at this stage still in eastern Poland. =Noirmoutier= The Germans quickly overran northern France and Mankowska found a job as a translator-interpreter with the mayor, under the new administration, at the prefecture on the strategically important Island of Noirmoutier off the Atlantic coast. She did nothing to conceal her Polish provenance, nor, indeed, that she was a Countess. The German's were impressed by her easy fluency in French and German, and by her commitment and diligence. Despite her gender, beauty and aristocratic bearing, she was very happy to travel to military bases in order to provide translation services. The Germans were unaware of the extent to which she remembered what she saw. She accompanied the German regional governor, Karl Maier, on a visit to Saint- Nazaire because there were \\"lots of French\\" there. She accompanied him into a large covered hangar containing two of the latest Type VII submarines. Later she had time to sit and wait in the car: using the backs table-napkins Ma≈Ñkowska was able to sketch plans of the interior configurations and staircases of the submarines as well as the external doors. She was interrupted when Maier stuck his head through the car window to ask her \\"what is this fellow on about?\\". The fellow, a small Frenchman with a mustache, was venting his rage because his time off to be with his wife for the birth of their child had been cancelled. Maier puffed out his already puffy face and rolled his eyes deep into his skull. \\"This is war, boy\\", he sighed. There are reports that notes provided by Mankowska ware later critical to the planning of a major allied raid on the Saint-Nazaire submarine base. After a few months Klementyna Mankowska applied to her German employers for permission to take a break, back in occupied Poland. She was keen to meet up with \\"Muszkieterowie\\" comrades. While she was awaiting a response to her application she spotted a large German car on Noirmoutier. Noirmoutier was then as now, for many purposes, something of a backwater, and the presence of two important German officers in the island's best restaurant, with their staff car waiting outside, was noteworthy. Through the window of the restaurant, she could see two German colonels were using very broken French to try and order their meal from a waiter, who was successfully understanding nothing. She entered and offered her services as translator. The officers were delighted by the timely if unexpected appearance of this helpful and beautiful Polish countess, who was able quickly to smooth out any misunderstandings with the waiter. They invited her to join them. As they ate, drank and chatted, Mankowska worked her charms: she learned from her dinner companions that they were part of the German High Command. The officers also found out some things about the countess. She told them she was terrified of the end of the war, because she had no idea who would be around to look after her. A few letters of commendation from field commanders would be of limited usefulness. The men were sympathetic. Then one of them had an idea. He said he would issue her with a document, bearing the seal of the German High Command, attesting to her pro-German credentials and requesting \\"all military and civilian institutions to provide her with advice and assistance\\". Mankowska gratefully accepted the offer. An genuine seal of the German High Command would be particularly useful to the \\"Muszkieterowie\\". It helped Stefan Witkowski create high quality fake seals of his own which he used for his clandestine missions in different parts of Europe. Ma≈Ñkowska's leave was authorized soon afterward. By the time she arrived in Warsaw she was convinced that she had been tracked during the train journey. A German staff officer sat down next to her and asked what she was reading. He seemed unable to get over the fact that she was traveling in a first class carriage normally reserved for German military personnel. (Travel arrangements had been made by helpful field commanders in Noirmoutier.) Eventually her travelling companion stood up, bowed, and explained that he had to leave the train, \\"but we will definitely see each other again\\". In Poland she met up with Witkowski and told him about her travelling companion. \\"Not Gestapo, they never promise anything. Might be a coincidence, one more German officer who spotted your 100% Aryan beauty\\", was Witkowski's assessment. She told him where she had been and what she had been doing. She was able to hand over various details and plans on the rapidly growing Saint-Nazaire naval base. Witkowski was particularly thrilled when she handed over the seal of the German High Command. A week after she got back to western France she was arrested and taken to the Gestapo detention centre in Nantes where she was held overnight. Everyone was scrupulously polite: the arresting officer was merely following orders. He had no idea why Ma≈Ñkowska was being arrested. Ma≈Ñkowska behaved like a countess, insisting on packing in a small suitcase her night gown, her bathrobe, four pink jars of Elizabeth Arden cosmetics and a napkin to cover the table in the cell to which, presumably, she was about to be driven. On reaching the cell she asked the guard for an extra blanket and a sheet. This was not usual behaviour for people arrested by the Gestapo, but unwilling to risk inadvertently upsetting someone higher in the hierarchy, the confused guard obliged. After her night in the cell at Nantes she was transported to Paris where a dungeon awaited her. Almost immediately she met Sturmbannf√ºhrer Karl Schwerbel, the head of the Gestapo office in Paris for Polish affairs and people. It turned out that she was not, as she had anticipated, about to be interrogated about her \\"Muszkieterowie\\" activities and then shot. The matter was more mundane: well-intentioned German officers on the ground in Noirmoutier had concealed Ma≈Ñkowska's Polish nationality when referring to her in their reports. Their wish to avoid causing trouble for her had had the opposite result. Nevertheless, she had no difficulty in convincing Schwerbel that she had been unaware of the subterfuge, and he unhesitatingly declared her innocent. Despite her complaints about the cost in time and money involved in arresting and detaining her and then sending her by car to Paris, he now expended more of the Gestapo budget in order to send her back in a first-class train compartment to the west of France and her base on the Island of Noirmoutier. The picture postcard that Ma≈Ñkowska received in Noirmoutier may not have come as a total surprise. The picture was of a seaside scene. The sender had written his message on the back: :\\"You may not remember our meeting, but I fell in love at first sight. I expressed surprise that you travelled in a carriage reserved for German soldiers. I said then that we would meet again because I was counting on it. I am still counting. Doctor Alexander. PS Heil Hitler\\" Doctor Alexander's visit to Noirmoutier was, formally, a purely social affair. He emerged from his car wearing the same staff officer uniform and badges he had been wearing on that train. During dinner he talked about himself. He liked to call himself \\"Doctor\\": his full name was Wallraf Hans Alexander. He talked with passion of his time as a soldier during the Great War and about the old days under the Kaiser. He mentioned that he had placed \\"Heil Hitler\\" on his post card only for the benefit of the censors, which tended to confirm Ma≈ÑkowskƒÖ's suspicion that his current employer might be some kind of intelligence agency. He was, perhaps, working for the British. =Berlin= Meanwhile, German intelligence, convinced of Klementyna Mankowska's pro-German sentiments, selected her as a potential agent. In June 1941 she started a new job, based in Berlin and working at the Foreign Ministry. It was the first stage in her training. While she was in Berlin she remembered a card that had been delivered for her attention a few months earlier care of her coursin Teresa ≈Åubie≈Ñska. Harold von Hoepfner was still alive and he was in town. At dinner, with the same casual boasting that he had employed to give her advance notice of the French invasion in May 1940, he openly talked of his imminent posting as part of the vast army that would shortly be invading the Soviet Union. Mankowska had been welcomed into the Hoepfner family's Berlin apartment as a longstanding family friend. It was important, von Hoepfner, pointed out, that the invasion of Russia should be launched soon so that they did not get caught out by the Russian winter like Napoleon. Later the name of Rudolf \\"Dolf\\" von Scheliha came up in conversation. Von Scheliha had worked as a German diplomat in the Warsaw embassy between 1932 and 1939. He had regularly participated in hunting parties at aristocratic estates in the vast Polish countryside. He was, it turned out, a mutual friend. Mankowska would love to meet up with him again. Von Hoepfner disappeared to make a few 'phone calls. He returned with good news. Von Scheliha was working for the Foreign Ministry, and just now he was in town. Harold von Hoepfner jotted down a telephone number and handed it over. Dolf von Scheliha was expecting her call. When they met up she saw a stooped sixty-year-old man. (He was actually in his mid-40s.) He insisted that they should talk to each other exclusively in French, and proposed a walk around Berlin's famous Tiergarten (zoo park). It had been made clear that for security reasons Mankowska should not expect to be contacted directly by German intelligence during her internship with the Foreign Ministry. However, the guidelines for it had been planned in advance. During her two-month internship she would be provided with her own desk and she would be permitted to take her own notes. Information about the imminent invasion the Soviet Union - some of the information - would be made available to her. But that was far from being the only topic on which she would become better informed. Two days after the internship began three million German soldiers crossed into the Soviet Union on a mission of conquest. That day Dolf von Scheliha placed several folders market \\"secret\\" on Ma≈Ñkowska's desk in the ministry. They did not concern the invasion. It appears they were preliminary detailed plans for the extermination of Europe's Jews. There were indications of the number of people to be packed into ghettos, the most effective ways of implementing mass-killings, transport planning and of plans to create a \\"death factory\\" near Warsaw at Treblinka. Ma≈Ñkowska saw these planning documents six months before the Wannsee Conference at which the various government departments were presented with them. She herself later stated her belief that she had been the first foreigner to learn that the German government were planning mass-murder on a truly unprecedented scale. Despite the times and events through which she lived, Klementyna Mankowska always maintained a resolutely positive view of human nature, but as she would write many decades later in her memoirs, faced with the evidence of the Holocaust plans, she was forced to recalibrate her optimism. It later turned out that von Scheliha had not consulted with German intelligence before passing files about the planning for the Holocaust to Ma≈Ñkowska. He had his own agenda, and believed ‚Äì probably correctly ‚Äì that passing the information to Ma≈Ñkowska was tantamount to passing the information to Polish and British intelligence. Over the next few months, his continuing careful documentation of National Socialist atrocities in Poland created one of the most comprehensive records of the subject ever compiled. His own efforts to alert foreign governments to what was going on became increasingly intense and were probably effective. Several times he travelled to Switzerland as part of his mission to warn, but he always returned home to Berlin. In the end it became clear that Rudolf von Scheliha had become identified by the authorities as an \\"anti-Nazi\\", and had himself been under surveillance by the German authorities for a long time: sources indicate ‚Äì without providing much detail ‚Äì that he had been passing information to \\"Moscow\\" since the 1930s. He was detained, given a brief trial and on 22 December 1942 executed by guillotine at Berlin's Pl√∂tzensee prison. During her internship with the Foreign Ministry in the middle part of 1941 Klementyna Mankowska had to take a few days off work and stay home with acute food poisoning. That, at least, is what she told management. She travelled to Warsaw in order to discuss with Stefan Witkowski the rich possibilities that had been opened up through her recruitment by German intelligence. A career as a double agent beckoned. The first visitor she received at Teresa ≈Åubie≈Ñska's Warsaw apartment was not Witkowski, however. A short plump Polish civilian knocked on the door while she was taking a cup of tea with her cousin. Uninvited, the new visitor installed himself in an armchair and introduced himself as \\"Witold\\". He enquired directly about the well-being of \\"Stewit\\" (Witkowski) and his network of \\"agents scattered all over Europe\\". He urged Mankowska not to worry, insisting that he and she were on the same side. \\"Adolf nicht gut\\". Mankowska was unsure what to make of the visitor and his message, the oblique delivery of which suggested that he was on a mission, probably, on behalf of British intelligence. He certainly did not appear to be operating according to the Gestapo rule book, and she could think of no reason why the German intelligence services should bother to follow her all the way to Warsaw just to convey a gratuitously opaque message that they knew she was not staying home with food poisoning. That evening Witkowski came round. He was very happy that Mankowska had been recruited by German intelligence but he did not hesitate to let her know how this added to his problems. There was an inherent rivalry between the \\"Muszkieterowie\\", with their longstanding direct links to British intelligence and the \\"Dw√≥jka\\", till 1939 the Polish Military Intelligence agency, and since the Fall of France in 1940 represented in significant numbers by political exiles living in London alongside members of the Polish government-in-exile. In London, the \\"Dw√≥jka\\" struggled jealously for recognition as the only credible Polish anti-Nazi espionage organisation, while Witkowski was convinced that much of the intelligence they picked up through their various connections was less directly sourced and more out of date than information that the \\"Muszkieterowie\\" could provide using their own network. Witkowski admitted that Mankowska's work as a double agent was going to be affected and possibly compromised by the intensifying rivalry between two very differently configured Polish intelligence organisations. \\"For them, you are an internal enemy, just like me. When is this Alexander fellow going to send you to Great Britain?\\" For Witkowski, Klementyna Mankowska's transfer to England as an agent of German intelligence (\\"Abwehr\\") would provide a welcome opportunity to establish direct contact with General Sikorski, leader of the Polish government-in-exile in London. But before that could happen she needed to undergo her Abwehr training. Witkowski believed she was at considerable peril as long as she remained in Warsaw where at any time someone associated with the \\"Dw√≥jka\\" might decide she was collaborating with the Nazis and carry out a death sentence against her. He urged her to conclude her \\"food poisoning\\" incident without delay and return to her desk in Berlin. The meeting with Witkowski may well have been a little rushed and it is impossible to know whether Mankowska alerted him to the files she had received containing plans for the forthcoming Holocaust. It seems possible she did not. There were at this time many people, including the leaderships of foreign governments, who were unable or unwilling to believe the scale of the Shoa being planned by the German authorities, however persuasive and complete the evidence may have appeared in retrospect to those who only became aware of the atrocities after many of the mass-murders had already been committed. There is speculation that Mankowska herself may have been among those who found it impossible to take at face value the evidence contained in the files that Dolf von Scheliha had left on her desk at the ministry. It was anticipated by German intelligence that when she reached London Mankowska would be able to obtain a position of trust with an appropriate ministry or government agency, and it would then be important to be able to encrypt the contents of stolen documents. Much of her training involved mastery of the necessary encryption techniques and the associated rotating sipher tables. She was taught about important codes, addresses and pseudonyms for German intelligence contacts in London. During breaks in her study, Alexander came to explain various tools of the trade including the wooden box which, using easily replaceable ingredients such as lemon juice, alcohol and cotton wool, contained the necessary elements for written communication using \\"invisible ink\\". There was a close-range miniature dart shooter disguised as a pen. There was a lipstick canister that was actually a small bullet canister. As Ma≈Ñkowska completed her training at the Abwehr training camp in Berlin it became apparent that a final decision still had not been taken over whether to send her to London. On a further visit to Cousin Teresa's apartment in Warsaw she discussed the possibilities with Witkowski. It was not impossible that the Germans had found out about her \\"Muszkieterowie\\" connections, possibly from other Polish agencies. Witkowski thought it unlikely that the \\"Dw√≥jka\\" had \\"such long arms\\". The Abwehr option was the only chance the \\"Muszkieterowie\\" had to infiltrate an agent into Britain. The other possibilities were all too risky. It was fruitless to speculate on the background to any delays on the part of German intelligence bosses in reaching the necessary decision. Over the next twenty minutes, he handed over various items to be delivered when she reached London. His personal letter for General Sikorski described the increasingly perilous impact on the ground of the competition for influence between the \\"Dw√≥jka\\" and the \\"Muszkieterowie\\". He handed over microfilms, which she herself had prepared some time earlier, showing German bases and fortifications along the French Atlantic coastline, and including drawings of the dry dock at St. Nazaire. There were microfilmed texts to be personally handed over to the British intelligence officer who would, he assumed, question her on her arrival in England. Unfortunately the microfilm machine had broken down, however, so the final four pages had been sewn into a navy blue ribbon which formed the bottom part of a stylish petticoat that she should wear for the journey, but which was not yet ready. A few days earlier Mankowska had received a visit from someone whom \\"Doctor Alexander\\" identified simply as \\"my boss\\". His uniform was faded, and his sweater was patched. Wilhelm Canaris served as head of German military intelligence between 1935 and his spectacular fall from grace early in 1944. His loyalties may already have been more conflicted than the German government appreciated. It is believed by some that there were aspects of National Socialist Germany that horrified him. He sat down beside Mankowska and shared his thoughts: \\"You do not have to go. We are wondering whether to take this risk. You are prepared, but it is not clear whether the need exists to launch this mission.\\" There was no direct answer to Mankowska's question, \\"Then why have I been trained?\\". \\"But if you do go, do you have any wishes before the trip? It might end in tragedy.\\" Mankowska replied that she would like to see Warsaw again, and a two-day holiday to the city was duly arranged. There is speculation that Mankowska's true mission, from the point of view of the Abwehr, was to be available in England as a backup in case of a failure by Halina Szyma≈Ñska's espionage mission. Halina Szyma≈Ñska was another spy of Polish provenance, who at different stages seems to have been working for more than one national intelligence agency at a time. By the time of Mankowska's proposed mission to London, Szyma≈Ñska's close connections to Wilhelm Canaris already went back several years. That final two-day break in Warsaw provided an opportunity for Witkowski to hand over the elegant petticoat with documents secured in the thick blue ribbon round the hem. She rearranged herself to put on the petticoat while he gave her a final briefing. He reassured her that she would not be arrested when she arrived at the airport in London. Two days after her arrival three men would stop her and apparently arrest her. A brief Reuters news item would be transmitted on the late evening radio news that evening by the BBC, stating that a German spy had been intercepted and detained. That would be a message to the \\"Muszkieterowie\\" that she had arrived safely, and a message to the Abwehr that she had been arrested and her spy mission was over. She should then contact the British intelligence services before attempting to make contact with anyone else. After that she should try and arrange a personal meeting with General Sikorski and spell out the ever more dangerous situation between the \\"Dw√≥jka\\" and the \\"Muszkieterowie\\". On 24 March 1942 at 3.30 in the morning Mankowska was awakened in her room at the training centre and told to get dressed. Her mission was about to begin. The instruction was not wholly unexpected and she was ready in two minutes. After half an hour her driver delivered her to the little airport where she received her final briefing from \\"Doctor Alexander\\": \\"If things go wrong, please don't take chances. If you feel threatened, your first priority is to look after yourself. You're flying via Nice in \\"Vichy\\". There we'll help you to get a legal British visa.\\" Squashed between the front seats of a Ju 52 transport plane, a few hours later she landed at Nice. Somehow Witkowski had found out that the route arranged by the Abwehr to London would include a stop-over in Nice. He arranged for Mankowska to have a breakfast meeting with Juliusz Kleeberg, who had been one of the most important Polish generals in the fight against the German/Soviet invasion in September 1939. He was one of those Polish ex-military personnel now living in precarious exile in Vichy France. Although Witkowski through his network was well informed on much that happened in countries under German occupation, his information on the situation in London seems to have been relatively sketchy. Kleeberg was able to provide Mankowska with more up to date background. The leaders of the London-based Polish government in exile, Generals Sikorski and Sosnkowski were at the centre of a small close-knit group of insiders, determined to protect their powerbase for the future, and intolerant of dissent. Their focus was on how they would govern Poland after the war. Kleeberg's words were not encouraging: \\"Look and listen ... All who stand in their way are little by little eliminated. Witkowski is doing very valuable work for the allies, but Poles cannot forgive him for maintaining direct contacts with the English. Things may end badly for him\\". =London= Mankowska's first few weeks in London were choreographed - presumably by the British authorities - exactly as Witkowski had told her. After her \\"arrest\\", news of it was carried in a brief item on the late evening BBC news, and she was taken to what one source describes as \\"the Patriotic School, an enormous red brick building occupied by MI5\\". Her interrogator introduced himself as Captain Malcolm Scott. The interrogation lasted for four weeks. She was carefully and systematically questioned about the training she had received from German intelligence and about the tasks that she had been assigned by the Germans. At one of the sessions Captain Scott provided two pieces of surprising information of his own: the first was more welcome than the second. Her husband and sons were also in London. Her husband had made his own way to England. Her sons had appeared separately and the British authorities had no idea, at least officially, how they had managed to make the journey. Unofficially it was presumed that they had arrived, somehow, courtesy of German intelligence. It turned out that the head of German intelligence, Wilhelm Canaris, had already given Mankowska his personal promise that if she went ahead with the mission to England, the boys would be sent to join her. The information that they were already safely in England came as a great relief but it was not, under all the circumstances, a complete surprise. The second piece of information was less welcome than the first but also, perhaps, not totally unsurprising. Scott knew that the German intelligence agencies had tried to obtain her a set of identity documents for her, but they had been unsuccessful. The British authorities had been willing to provide her with a British passport, but the move had been opposed by the London-based Polish government in exile once they found out that she had been sent by the \\"Muszkieterowie\\". Scott said that the British authorities had been trying to convince the Polish leaders in London that Mankowska was an Abwehr (German) agent, but the Poles remained implacably hostile to her presence in England. Because of this Scott urged her to leave London as soon as possible. After leaving the sessions at the Patriotic School had concluded Mankowska managed to arrange a meeting with General Sosnkowski, a leading member of the Polish government in exile. He made it clear that she was very unlikely to be able to arrange a meeting with the Polish leader, General Sikorski. He added that neither the Polish Government in exile nor the intelligence division of the Armia Krajowa (\\"Home Army\\"), the main underground resistance movement inside Poland, found it unacceptable that Stefan Witkowski maintained his own direct contacts with British Inelligence. He concluded with a piece of personal advice, which was the advice she had already received from her British interrogator, \\"Captain Scott of MI5\\", although Sosnkowski chose different words: \\"Please leave ... in London there is something else. An accident is not so difficult. Please eat eggs: it is harder to poison them ... Naturally I'm kidding\\". A few months later, at his home in Poland, Stefan Witkowski was shot dead. He was shot in the back of the head, but when it was found his body had been turned over in order to give greater prominence to the accompanying card which carried the descriptive message \\"Najwiƒôkszy polski bandyta\\" (\\"The greatest Polish bandit\\"). It would never become entirely clear whether Witkowski was killed by the AK (Polish resistance), or if the AK had simply led the Gestapo to him. Either way, directly after his shooting, surviving \\"Muszkieterowie\\" members in Poland, including Teresa ≈Åubie≈Ñska, started to be rounded up by the Gestapo. Stories circulated that Witkowski had been in touch not merely with British intelligence and Soviet intelligence. There are also hints that he may have collaborated with the Germans, who occupied the western half of Poland, against the Soviets, who occupied the eastern part and, as matters turned out, would turn out to be the more enduring threat. Although the mutual antipathy between the men who hoped to lead Poland's post-war government Stefan Witkowski is well attested, the precise details of the circumstances leading to Witkowski's killing remain unclear. =Edinburgh= Klementyna Ma≈Ñkowska remained in Britain till 1948, but she moved to Edinburgh, far from London and far from the Polish government in exile. Andrzej continued to be based in London where he made himself useful to the authorities, but he was able to visit his wife in Edinburgh at weekends. The couple's two sons attended a British boarding school. Their daughter, Maria, was born in Edinburgh on 20 June 1944. Klementyna worked in an Edinburgh hospital, undertaking translation work for Polish doctors unable to communicate in English. She would never again resume her prewar role as a lady of the manor. =Later years= In 1948 the family moved to Congo. There are indications that at this stage they were still legally stateless. Andrzej obtained a well-remunerated job with one of the colonial governments in Africa. The family were evidently accompanied in the Congo by Klementyna's mother who died at √âlisabethville (as it was then known) at the end of 1958. By 1997, which is when G√ºnter Blaurock, the German consul general in Lyon presented Mankowska with the Order of Merit (Bundesverdienstkreuz Erster Klasse) on behalf of President Herzog, in respect of her wartime exploits, the ceremony took place in the presence of the Polish ambassador and Prince Bismarck at Mankowska's home, the Ch√¢teau de Sermoise, near Nevers. (The Mankowski's daughter married a French aristocrat in 1970.) Her story had become better known to younger generations as a result of the publication of her autobiographical work Espionne malgr√© moi, prefaced by Michel Poniatowski, in May 1994 (published the next year in German as Odyssee einer Agentin). The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, in a book review, described her life story as \\"too fantastic for a novel\\".https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/politik/rezension-sachbuch-klug- und-weiblich-11308834.html The work wasn't published in her native Poland until January 2003. There is no English version. Andrzej and Klementyna Mankowski died respectively in 2001 and 2003. They both died at Sermoise near Nevers in central France.

A sequel to the maxi-series Crisis on Infinite Earths, this book's purpose was to remove the Justice Society of America from the DC universe, because the writers felt that the team of aging heroes had become irrelevant in the post-Crisis world. However, it was done in such a way that the JSA could be brought back in the future, should any writer wish. Main characters The following heroes take part in the main action of the book: * Atom (Al Pratt) * Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson) * Doctor Mid-Nite (Charles McNider) * Flash (Jay Garrick) * Green Lantern (Alan Scott) * Hawkgirl (Shiera Sanders Hall) * Hawkman (Carter Hall) * Hourman (Rex Tyler) * Power Girl * Sandman (Wesley Dodds) * Sandy the Golden Boy * Spectre (Jim Corrigan) * Star- Spangled Kid (Sylvester Pemberton) * Starman (Ted Knight) * Johnny Thunder and his Thunderbolt * Wildcat (Ted Grant) The following heroes appear in the 1945 flashback: * Batman (Earth-Two) * Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane) * Superman (Earth-Two) * Wonder Woman (Earth-Two) The following members of Infinity, Inc. make two cameo appearances: * Brainwave, Jr. * Fury (Hippolyta Trevor) * Jade * Northwind * Nuklon (Albert Rothstein) * Obsidian * Silver Scarab The principal villain of the story is Adolf Hitler, as he was depicted in All-Star Squadron. Plot Fifteen members and associates of the Justice Society‚ÄîHawkman, Hawkgirl, Flash, Green Lantern, Sandman, Sandy, Starman, Dr. Mid-Nite, Dr. Fate, Atom, Johnny Thunder, Hourman, Wildcat, Power Girl, and Star-Spangled Kid‚Äîare gathered for a private memorial service for the Robin and Huntress of Earth-Two, who had recently been killed in the Crisis. Feeling redundant in a world filled with younger heroes, the JSA is about to officially disband, when suddenly The Spectre appears to them, apparently fatally wounded despite being a ghost. In an instant of psychic communion, he puts a message into Dr. Fate's head, and then dissipates. Dr. Fate then psychically shares this information with all the others, and elaborates as he casts a spell to transport them all through time and space to Berlin on April 15, 1945. The message was that, while The Spectre was lying unconscious in the cosmic void in the aftermath of the Crisis, his unchecked energy had reached out in space and time, making contact with the Spear of Destiny in 1945 while Adolf Hitler was trying to use it to bring about the end of the world. The Spectre's power, added to that of the Spear, enabled it to bring about Hitler's \\"Twilight of the Gods,\\" destroying the Earth and the universe, and fatally wounding The Spectre in the process. He'd managed to reach the modern- day JSA and warn them of this disaster just before the altered past caught up with the present. The heroes arrive at their destination just in time to see Hitler start his spell, opening a whirling hole in the sky. The JSA fly up through the hole and find themselves in the realm of Asgard, home of the Norse/Teutonic Gods, who are about to fight their final battle (i.e., Ragnar√∂k). To prevent the Norse Gods from losing, and thus prevent the destruction of the Earth, Dr. Fate uses his magic to physically merge the other heroes with the Gods, adding to their might and willpower. Many of the heroes/Gods are killed in the battle, but the remaining ones fight on, determined to change its predetermined outcome. During the battle, days pass on Earth; Hitler's spell fails, Germany is defeated by the Allies, and Hitler and Eva Braun commit suicide. The heroes defeat almost all of the enemy, but they still have to beat Surtur, the fire-giant who's determined to burn away all life on the battlefield (and also the Earth). Due to the non-linear nature of time in the Asgardian realm, Dr. Fate is able to bring the slain heroes back to life, and together they fight and kill Surtur. However, because Ragnar√∂k is a never-ending battle, the battle starts all over again, and the heroes must re-fight it forever to prevent the end of the world. Dr. Fate sends Power Girl and the Star-Spangled Kid back home against their will, saying the young must sometimes be spared the fate of the old; Fate then prepares to enter the eternal battle alongside his comrades, when The Spectre‚Äîapparently fully healed‚Äîstops him, saying that Fate's magic is needed to eternally sustain the other heroes. Against his will, Fate is sent back home by The Spectre, who says that he himself has been called home by his Master. Dr. Fate finds himself back at the site of the memorial service along with Power Girl and Star-Spangled Kid. Seven members of Infinity, Inc. are also present, having shown up late for the service, and Fate psychically shows them everything that has happened. They walk away, along with PG and SSK, to grieve for the loss of their families and allies, leaving only Dr. Fate behind. Lying at his feet are chessmen shaped like the eternally-battling heroes. Notes * In the story, Hitler's Ragnar√∂k spell took place on the day of Franklin D. Roosevelt's funeral, at which the then-current roster of the JSA (including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Mr. Terrific) served as an honor guard. According to DC Special #29 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1977), Roosevelt played a major part in the original formation of the JSA.DC Special #29 at GCD * In The Sandman #26 (May 1991), which is collected in The Sandman: Season of Mists, it was revealed that the realm in which the heroes were trapped was actually a simulation created by Odin as a way to thwart the actual Ragnar√∂k.What world did Odin offer Sandman? at SciFi.StackExchange.com * In 1992, the miniseries Armageddon: Inferno brought the heroes out of Ragnar√∂k and back into the DC universe; this led directly into the 1992 Justice Society of America series.

An alternative version of the same hymn begins \\"En clara vox redarguit.\\" History The original version of the hymn dates from the 6th century. Whilst it has been attributed to a number of different authors, including St Ambrose, it is generally recorded in modern books as \\"anonymous.\\" As a result of Pope Urban VIII's revision of the Breviary, the hymn was re-written in a more classical Latin style and published in 1632, with the opening line \\"En clara vox redarguit.\\" Style The hymn is written in iambic dimeter and it is a retelling of the preaching of John the Baptist, announcing the coming of Christ in Luke's Gospel. Latin versions of the Hymn Vox clara ecce intonat > 1 VOX clara ecce intonat, obscura quaeque increpat: procul fugentur somnia; > ab aethere Christus promicat. 2 Mens iam resurgat torpida quae sorde exstat > saucia; sidus refulget iam novum, ut tollat omne noxium. 3 E sursum Agnus > mittitur laxare gratis debitum; omnes pro indulgentia vocem demus cum > lacrimis, 4 Secundo ut cum fulserit mundumque horror cinxerit, non pro reatu > puniat, sed nos pius tunc protegat. 5 Summo Parenti gloria Natoque sit > victoria, et Flamini laus debita per saeculorum saecula.

English Versions It is estimated that there are at least 27 English translations of the hymn. The following examples were widely used in the nineteenth and twentieth century. John Henry Newman > 1 Hark, a joyful voice is thrilling, And each dim and winding way Of the > ancient temple filling ; Dreams depart, for it is day. 2 Christ is coming ‚Äî > from thy bed, Earth-bound soul, awake and spring ‚Äî With the sun new-risen to > shed Health on human suffering. 3 Lo, to grant a pardon free, Comes a > willing Lamb from heaven ; Sad and tearful, hasten we, One and all, to be > forgiven. 4 Once again he comes in light Girding earth with fear and woe ; > Lord, be thou our loving might, From our guilt and ghostly foe. 5 To the > Father and the Son And the Spirit, who in heaven Ever witness, Three and > One, Praise on earth be ever given. John Mason Neale > 1 A THRILLING voice by Jordan rings, rebuking guilt and darksome things: > vain dreams of sin and visions fly; Christ in His might shines forth on > high. 2 Now let each torpid soul arise, that sunk in guilt and wounded lies; > see! the new Star's refulgent ray shall chase disease and sin away. 3 The > Lamb descends from heaven above to pardon sin with freest love: for such > indulgent mercy shewn with tearful joy our thanks we own. 4 That when again > He shines revealed, and trembling worlds to terror yield. He give not sin > its just reward, but in His love protect and guard. 5 To the most high > Parent glory be and to the Son be victory, and to the Spirit praise is owed > from age to age eternally. Amen Edward Caswall > 1 Hark! a herald voice is calling: 'Christ is nigh,' it seems to say; 'Cast > away the dreams of darkness, O ye children of the day!' 2 Startled at the > solemn warning, Let the earth-bound soul arise; Christ, her Sun, all sloth > dispelling, Shines upon the morning skies. 3 Lo! the Lamb, so long expected, > Comes with pardon down from heaven; Let us haste, with tears of sorrow, One > and all to be forgiven; 4 So when next he comes with glory, Wrapping all the > earth in fear, May he then as our defender Of the clouds of heaven appear. 5 > Honour, glory, virtue, merit, To the Father and the Son, With the co-eternal > Spirit, While unending ages run.

He worked as a writer and editor for Spanish-language newspapers in the United States. He advocated for working class Cubans of color. He was a key figure in New York City, contributing to a larger movement for Cuban Independence happening across the United States.  Early life  Rafael Serra was born Jos√© Rafael Sim√≥n Agapito in the Monserrate neighborhood of Havana, Cuba on March 24, 1858. His surnames were Serra and Montalvo. He was born while slavery continued in Cuba. At age thirteen, his father died and he was forced to abandon his studies to help support his family. He found employment as a cigar factory apprentice. He later married Mar√≠a Gertrudis Heredia in 1878, and they had four children, including a daughter, Consuelo. A short time later he moved from his hometown to Matanzas. At the age of 21 he established the Harmony Society for Instruction and Leisure, where he taught classes to children in the day and day laborers at night. The school offered, among other activities, free classes to 48 black and white children.  Career  Rafael Serra played a prominent role in raising awareness and support for the efforts that led to the Cuban War of Independence during the 1880s and 1890s. Working alongside Jos√© Mart√≠ and other Cuban Americans in New York City, Serra was a political journalist who wrote for and edited several newspapers in the United States, including La Doctrina de Mart√≠. On August 5, 1883, an organization called El Club de los Independientes was formed by several Afro-Cuban migrants. Rafael Serra served on the Board of Trustees along with pro-independence and pro-labor revolutionaries Justo Lanigua, Mart√≠n Mor√∫a Delgado, and Vicente Diascosmas. They organized themselves so that they could aid in the efforts toward Cuban Independence, hoping to use their experiences to inform Cubans about the harsh realities of life in the United States. Racial inequality persisted while Serra lived in New York City. Afro-Cubans experienced harsh discrimination and segregation and were often left to work difficult, labor-intensive jobs at restaurants and cigar factories. Serra once wrote that, \\"through no fault of their own, Afro Cubans remained the poorest and most uneducated element of Cuban society.\\" Devoted to promoting the interests of black Cubans, Serra emphasized the importance of education founding educational institutions such as La Liga de Instruccion.  Life Work = La Liga de Instruccion = La Liga de Instruccion was an educational institution founded by Rafael Serra, designed to \\"elevate the character of men of color born in Cuba and Puerto Rico\\". La Liga held its first official meeting on January 22, 1890. Black Cuban and Puerto Rican men living in New York City came to study, where they learned how to fight for social justice, equality and labor rights. Serra's goal was to provide black Cuban men with the proper tools to defend themselves. =La Doctrina de Marti= Serra founded La Doctrina de Marti, inspired by his friend Jos√© Mart√≠. The first volume issue was published on July 25, 18976. The newspaper circulated throughout Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. It was noted as \\"an important newspaper for all Cubans\\" by Jos√© A Malberti, the president of El Club Pol√≠tico Cubano Bartolome Mas√≥, based in Mexico. The paper had a central focus on educating the working class on political and cultural justice issues.

Weare was a wooden sternwheel steamship built in 1892 for service on the Yukon River. She played a notable role in the Klondike gold rush, being the second ship to bring news of the Klondike gold strike and an estimated $1 million in gold down the river in 1897. This set off the gold rush. The vessel carried freight and passengers up the Yukon to Dawson City and later Fairbanks. She was abandoned in 1926 or 1927, after the need for steamboat transport to the interior declined.  Construction  Chicago Businessman Portus B. Weare Portus Baxter Weare (January 1, 1842 - February 23, 1909) was born in a log cabin at Otsego, Michigan, then a remote settlement. His wilderness childhood led him into an early career as a fur trader. He met Captain John Jerome Healy at his trading post at Fort Benton, Montana and the two men began to work together in the fur trade. By the mid-1880s, many of the peltries were in decline due to over hunting, so Weare moved on to grain trading in Chicago. He was a success, and became wealthy. He was a member of the Chicago Board of Trade for over forty years. In 1892 Healy visited Weare at his Chicago office. They had not seen each other since 1874, but subsequent actions suggest there was a trusting relationship between the two. Healy had moved from Montana to Dyea, Alaska and established a trading post. There he met prospectors returning from the interior who brought news of the Fortymile gold strike in the Yukon drainage. Healy was searching for financing to exploit this find and turned to his old friend Weare to propose an investment. To back up his story, Healy placed a buckskin bag of gold dust and nuggets on Weare's desk. Healy succeeded in raising $50,000 to start the venture. Weare, Healy, and John and Michael Cudahy, fellow members of the Chicago Board of Trade, founded the North American Transportation and Trading Company. Weare was named Chairman of the Board of Directors. The goal of the company was not to mine for gold, but to provide goods and services to the anticipated rush of miners in the same way that Weare traded with fur trappers and grain farmers. Weare, Healy, Weare's son, William, Captain J. C. Barr, and Charles H. Hamilton set off to Seattle. Here Weare contracted with John J. Holland, a well-regarded shipwright, to build a steamer that could travel upstream from the Pacific Ocean to the gold fields in the Yukon. The Weares, Healy, Holland and a crew of 14 of his shipyard workers, all the materials for the ship, the ways on which to build it, and 300 tons of trade goods and supplies were loaded onto the schooner-rigged steamship Alice Blanchard. She sailed north on July 6, 1892 and reached St. Michael Island, about 80 miles north of the mouth of the Yukon, on August 10, 1892. A settlement on St. Michael Island, called St. Michael, was founded by the Russian-American Company in 1835 to trade with Yupik natives, but by 1892 it had been taken over by the Alaska Commercial Company. Weare had hoped to use this trading post as a base for his shipyard, but the Alaska Commercial Company had a virtual monopoly on the Yukon steamship business and saw Weare as a competitor. It refused to cooperate. The Alice Blanchard was forced to anchor two miles offshore and to ferry supplies to the beach in the ship's boats and a 40' scow built on site. Weare started a new trading post about a mile north of St. Michael. It took a month to unload at Weare's new settlement, which was dubbed Fort Get There. Holland and his crew had completed parts for the ship at his Ballard shipyard before sailing north, so rather than building it from raw materials, the job at Fort Get There was to assemble the parts. Even this task was fraught with difficulty, however, because the competitors at the Alaska Commercial Company tried to hire Holland's men at double their wages. Thankfully for Holland and Weare, the US Revenue Cutter Bear sailed in to St Michael. Its captain, Michael A. Healy, was reported to have threatened the laborers with hanging if they did not get to work, and offered some of Bear's tools and crew to help with the job. Nonetheless, it is a testament to Holland's skill that, despite the complete lack of any facilities and the labor unrest, the Portus B. Weare was launched on September 17, 1892, less than two months after arriving on St. Michael Island. She was 175 feet long, but drew only 4 feet of water when fully loaded (and a mere 16 inches without freight aboard), allowing her to safely navigate the shallow and uncharted river. Weare, Holland, and fourteen other men not headed up the Yukon returned to San Francisco aboard Bear.  Operation  Above all, navigation on the Yukon was a seasonal enterprise. The river froze over in late September or early October and became unnavigable until the ice broke up in June. Even when it was flowing, the river was deeper in the spring as the snow melted and shallower in the summer and fall. There were no charts, buoys, or other aids to navigation. Grounding on sand bars was a common occurrence and freight was often off-loaded to lighten the steamers sufficiently to refloat. As a rule, Yukon steamers did not run at night due to the navigational difficulties but this did not present much of a constraint because at the high latitudes of the Yukon it was light during most of the time the river was unfrozen. Portus B. Weare would typically take between two and three weeks to ascend the river from St. Michael to Dawson City, and somewhat less heading downstream. During her service on the Yukon she would typically make 2-3 round trips per season, but in at least one year made four deliveries to Dawson City. Steamers on the Yukon, including Portus B. Weare, often towed, pushed, or were lashed to barges to increase the freight they could move. Portus B. Weare, like all the steamers on the river, was wood fired and would stop every six hours or so to pick up wood that had been precut and to gather driftwood. She burned 25 to 30 cords of wood per day when underway on the river. Captain Benjamin Franklin Horn earned the nickname \\"Driftwood\\" by grounding Portus B. Weare on a sand bar while engaged in gathering fuel. Passengers would often leave the ship to pick berries, hunt ducks, or just stretch their legs on shore while the crew was \\"wooding up\\". Mosquitoes were a constant complaint on these occasions. = 1892 - 1896 = Portus B. Weare immediately after launch in September 1892 leaving St. Michael Island for the Yukon Immediately after launching and sea trials, the new steamship was loaded with trade goods. Captain J. C. Barr and John Healy took her up the Yukon, crossing the bar at the river's north mouth on September 28, 1892. By October 1, Portus B. Weare was about 500 miles up the river, but by October 5, when she was about 800 miles up the Yukon, the thickness of the ice made further travel impossible. She was frozen in for the winter. Charles H. Hamilton snowshoed from the ship to Dyea via Chilkoot Pass, reaching Seattle on April 11, 1893. He reported the status of the venture to Weare in Chicago, and then returned to the St. Michael with another load of provisions for Portus B. Weare to take up the river in the spring of 1893. The energetic Hamilton later became secretary of the North American Transportation and Trading Company, and had one of its Yukon Steamers named after him. After the break-up of the ice in the spring of 1893 made the Yukon navigable again, Healy went on to establish a new trading post, Fort Cudahy, near the mouth of the Fortymile River and stocked it with food and mining supplies carried by Portus B. Weare. Healy undercut the prices of the Alaska Commercial Company trading post across the river, and his goods sold well. During the winter of 1893 - 1894, the ship was moored in a slough near Fort Cudahy. Healy sailed out of the interior in the fall of 1894 for the first time since ascending the Yukon on Portus B. Weare's first trip in 1892. He reported back to Weare in Chicago about his success selling goods to the miners. Additional capital was raised and Healy returned to St. Michael with more trade goods for the spring of 1895. With the additional capital, he had a second steamer built at Fort Get There, J.J. Healy, in 1895. Placer gold strikes at Birch Creek and Fortymile River brought more miners to the region. The strikes also brought the North-West Mounted Police. There were several thousand men in the Canadian portion of the Yukon and, as of 1894, exactly one policeman. The Dominion of Canada correctly predicted that the new strikes would draw yet more miners to the region and decided to place a post on the river with 20 men. On July 5, 1895 Portus B. Weare left St. Michael with the Canadian contingent. The ship reached Fortymile River on July 24, 1895 and the Canadians unloaded their supplies near Fort Cudahy. The ship took eight of the men further upstream to Twelve Mile River where they cut timber which was floated back down to Fort Cudahy. The Mounties rented the North American Transportation and Trading Company sawmill there, and used the lumber they produced to build Fort Constantine, the first police post in the Yukon. = 1897: Klondike gold strike = Portus B. Weare spent the winter of 1896 - 1897 frozen in at Dawson City. The ice went out of the Yukon about June 15 and she started down the 1600 miles to the sea. On June 27, 1897, Portus B. Weare reached St. Michael with 60 miners on board and an estimated $1 million in gold dust and nuggets from the Klondike gold fields. She was the second steamer to bring news of the new strike, arriving two days after the Alaska Commercial Company's steamer Alice. When the miners and their gold reached Seattle and San Francisco, the Klondike gold rush began. Portus B. Weare was loaded with passengers and 300 tons of provisions at St. Michael. She sailed up the river again on July 3, 1897. There was real concern that starvation could be a problem in the gold fields and the Alaska Commercial Company and the North American Transportation and Trading Company cooperated to get supplies to the interior before the river froze over in late September. She reached Dawson City On July 25, 1897. On her return voyage, she took more miners and their gold back to St. Michael. Twenty miles below Circle City, Alaska she grounded on a sand bar and was stuck there for 19 days. She was forced to shift her passengers to J.J. Healy to continue their journey. The ship took more than a month to reach St. Michael. On her final passage up river in 1897 there was more trouble. When Portus B. Weare stopped at the company's trading post at Circle City she was boarded by a committee of the local miners. They were just as short of supplies as the miners in Dawson City and winter was approaching. After some unsatisfactory negotiations they decided to take what they wanted by force. On September 20, 1897 fifty armed miners surrounded the ship and began unloading supplies, taking 30 tons. Attempting to seem reasonable in their piracy, the miners took only what they believed they needed, so as not to starve other miners in Dawson City, paid for the goods, and even looted an Alaska Commercial Company steamer, Bella, so as not to seem unfair to either company. Despite all the obstacles in the voyage, Portus B. Weare did reach Dawson City before the river froze. Unfortunately, after the miners in Circle City helped themselves to her cargo, the supplies aboard skewed toward mining equipment and whiskey rather than food. Faced with potential scurvy and starvation in Dawson, the ship was loaded to over capacity with miners and sailed back down the river. The fee for the trip was $50. She did not make it back to St. Michael, for the river froze while she was en route. She spent the winter of 1897 - 1898 at Circle City. Many of her passengers took off in small boats and on foot. The piracy on Portus B. Weare and other incidents where desperate miners had taken trading posts by force showed that Alaska and the Yukon were essentially lawless. The 20 Mounties at Fort Constantine were no match for tens of thousands of miners spread over hundreds of miles of wilderness. Understandably, Weare became concerned with security. He is reported to have purchased a Maxim machine gun in 1897 for Portland, the sea-going vessel he chartered for runs between Seattle and St. Michael. Nonetheless, the gold rush was undeniably good for business. The fare from Seattle to the goldfields, including board, was advertised at $1,000 in August 1897, but had been lowered to $700 by September = 1898: Klondike gold rush = By 1898 the North American Transportation and Trading Company fleet had grown to six steamers. The company had offices at 618 First Avenue in Seattle, where it took bookings from Yukon bound travelers. It offered a complete suite of services to miners including ocean transport to St. Michael, a hotel at Fort Get There, river transport up the Yukon, food, mining supplies, and financing for mining ventures. It even had a rather unusual real estate business buying gold mines from departing miners to sell to newcomers. The company also offered employment to miners in the winter chopping wood to fuel the next year's steamboats. Its first ship headed to Alaska in 1898 left Seattle on June 10, and additional ships followed every ten days. On a summer run from St. Michael to Dawson City in 1898, Portus B. Weare was loaded with whiskey. The ship was met by Portus B. Weare himself about 100 miles up the river. He had come overland via Chilkoot Pass. No doubt the whiskey would have sold well, but given the ongoing issue of food shortages in the interior, Weare ordered the ship back to St. Michael to change her cargo for more practical provisions. The ship finally left St. Michael on July 22, 1898 for her trip up the Yukon. She arrived at Dawson with 300 tons of freight in early August. She carried no passengers up river, so as not to exacerbate the potential of starvation in the gold fields during the coming winter. = 1899 - 1927 = In 1898 gold was found at Nome, and by the spring of 1899 the Nome gold rush had begun. The new strike diverted miners away from the Yukon gold fields. Steamboat traffic on the river slumped. The miners already in the Klondike had gold to spend, however. Portus B. Weare transported $1 million of gold earned by the trading posts of the North American Transportation and Trading Company down the Yukon in the spring of 1899. Portus B. Weare spent the winter of 1900 - 1901 at St. Michael. In 1903, traffic to the Klondike had fallen so far that the North American Transportation and Trading Company lost $400,000. Portus B. Weare had difficulties in his grain trading business at the same time, leading ultimately to his expulsion from the Chicago Board of Trade and personal bankruptcy. He was in no position to rescue the company he had initially financed. In 1904 the company closed three of its trading posts and leased its fleet of steamers to individual captains. A bit of good news came in 1902 when gold was discovered in Fairbanks, Alaska, on the Tanana River, a tributary of the Yukon about 900 miles from St. Michael. In these later years, supplying Fairbanks with goods from the outside became much more important than the gold fields. In February 1911 the North American Transportation and Transport Company, including Portus B. Weare, was acquired by the Merchants' Yukon Line. At the time of the sale the estate of Michael Cudahy was the largest shareholder. One of the two partners who organized Merchants' Yukon Line was the same energetic Charles Hamilton who had walked out from the frozen-in Portus B. Weare in 1892. Under its new ownership, Portus B. Weare made the first delivery of the year of livestock to Fairbanks on July 10, 1911. This included 100 head of cattle and 75 - 80 hogs. It took her 15 days to reach Fairbanks from St. Michael. Two days later she headed back down the river to take cargo off another Merchants' Yukon Line steamer, J. P. Light. Off-loading the deeply laden vessel allowed the two ships to bring the full load up the shallow Tanana to Fairbanks. She returned to Fairbanks with another 200 tons of freight on July 19, 1911. By August 7, 1911 Portus B. Weare was back at St. Michael. The ship may never have sailed again. Although still documented by the Bureau of Navigation, she was listed as not operating in 1912. Portus B. Weare was abandoned at St. Michael in 1926 or 1927. At the time she was one of the oldest steamers on the river and her design and machinery were obsolete. Furthermore, the Alaska Railroad had reached Fairbanks, reducing the need for steamboat transportation to the interior.  Captains  Captain John J. Healy Historical sources give us a partial list of the captains of Portus B. Weare. The title \\"captain\\" is somewhat ambiguous in that it was applied to both the master in charge of the vessel and the pilot, who focused only on the tricky navigation of the river. 1892: Captain John Jerome (\\"Johnny\\") Healy, the general manager of the North American Transportation and Trading Company, is credited by some sources as taking the vessel up the Yukon immediately after its construction. Other sources credit Captain John Christie Barr, who was without doubt also an important figure at the company since it named one of its later ships after him. In fact, one captain may have acted as master, while the other acted as pilot. 1895: Captain William E. Geiger 1898: Captain E. D. Dixon served briefly, but clashed with John Healy. He quit and joined the Alaska Commercial Company as a steamship captain. Captain John Christie Barr is also listed aboard Portus B. Weare in 1898. 1899: Captain Benjamin Franklin (\\"Frank\\") Horn earned the nickname \\"\\"Driftwood\\" by grounding Portus B. Weare while collecting fuel for the boilers. Captain Thomas A. Hoy is also listed aboard in 1899. 1906: Captain John M. Gilham 1907: Captain A. Medley 1911: Captain Thomas S.

The post initially headed the galley squadron manned by convicts and captives rather than free crewmen. Convicts (condannati) and Muslim captives began to be employed as rowers in the Venetian navy , when the first institutions to administer them are also attested. The post of governatore dei condannati was also created at this time. The use of convicts to row the galleys increased over time, except for the flagships and the galeasses. Finally, as the number of galleys in the Venetian fleet diminished in favour of sailing ships of the line, after 1721 all Venetian galleys were exclusively manned by convicts. Like all squadron commanders of the rowed fleet (armata sottile)‚Äîthe Provveditore d'Armata, the Capitano delle galeazze, and the Capitano in Golfo‚Äîhe hoisted his ensign on a bastard galley, with striped red-and-white sails and tents. As his distinctive signs, the flagship of the governatore dei condannati carried a single lantern and the standard of Saint Mark on a plain-topped staff aft, and on the foremast a square ensign of Saint Mark with an egg-shaped tail. His staff included a chancellor (cancelliere) or a secretary nominated by the Council of Ten, an adjutant (ammiraglio), a quartermaster (sopramasser), and a standard- bearer. For his personal service he had a head of household (maestro di casa), a steward (scalco), a cook (cuoco), a wine steward (canever), and two orderlies (fanti di pizzuol). In addition he had at his disposal a boat (felucca) with twelve boatsmen (caiccheri) and a rowed frigate with a captain (padrone), two steersmen (timonieri), two artillerymen (bombardieri) and 18 rowers (galeotti).

The east of the island is the only area with volcanic rocks exposed at the surface, including basalt, ash and breccia. Phyllite shale spans the north coast. Laventille Formation limestone is associated with these rocks and contains a gypsum layer. Flysch, dark shale and quartzite deposited during the Cretaceous, followed by Naparina Hill Formation argillite.

Clastic material and conglomerate marked a shift to erosion in uplifted areas in the late Eocene. The Central Range was uplifted in the Oligocene, although deep water clay and marl suggests a deepening of basins such as the Northern Basin. The oil bearing Herrera sands are part of the largely Miocene age Cipero Formation. The Lengua and Tamana formation marks a shift back to deep-water clays along with reef limestones. Shallow deposition prevailed in many parts of the island into the Pliocene. Successive uplift and erosion became common in the Pliocene after the main phase of the Andean orogeny ended to the south. Changes in sea level during and since the Pleistocene have played a key role in deposition. Tobago terrane The island of Tobago is situated on the Tobago terrane, a section of crust bounded by the South American and Caribbean plates. It is bounded by faults formed from the Cretaceous to the present and comprises Cretaceous oceanic crust, volcanogenic and pelagic marine sedimentary rocks, late Cretaceous and Paleogene island arc volcanic rocks and overlying sedimentary rocks from the Neogene. The original mafic oceanic crust formed more than 120 million years ago and was then underplated and deformed by the continental Araya-Margarita Terrane 90 million years ago, which drove volcanic activity and formed a forearc basin. In the Paleogene, the region was denuded by erosion and then overridden by the Paria- Trinidad Terrane. Extensive erosion and faulting has affected the southern part of the terrane since the Neogene. The Mesozoic rocks on the island are divided into the North Coast Schist, mafic plutonic rocks, the Tobago Volcanic Group and mafic dikes.

Accessed 12 October 2020. Early Years Figueroa was born in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1851 and is believed to have studied at the Rafael Cordero school in San Juan. In his youth, he was apprenticed to the office of the typographer in the capital printing press of the liberal and Puerto Rican abolitionist, Jos√© Juli√°n Acosta, a former student of maestro Rafael Cordero.  Writing  Before moving to New York, Figueroa‚Äôs first job as a writer in Puerto Rico was in Ramon Mar√≠n‚Äôs print shop, Establicimiento Tipogr√°phico; there he wrote pieces for La Cr√≥nica and El Pueblo and acted as editor of these in Mar√≠n's absence. Figueroa began a print shop, after moving to New York in 1889; Imprenta America would serve as the publishing house for revolutionary newspapers such as Jose Mart√≠‚Äôs La Patria and El Porvernir. After the Cuban War of Independence, Figueroa moved to Cuba and often published articles in Cuban newspapers such as El F√≠garo, La Discus√≠on, and La Gaceta. He died in 1923 and in 1977 his book, La Verdad De La Historia was published in Puerto Rico posthumously. =Ensayo Biogr√°fico (Biographical Essay)= Months before he left Puerto Rico for the United States, Sotero began writing Ensayo Biogr√°fico (Biographical Essay) in which there were biographical sketches of those ‚Äú...who had most contributed to the progress of Puerto Rico.\\" This work offers a set of laudatory biographies that acknowledge the heroism of several Puerto Rican Creoles. In the Biographical Essays, there are also passages about race, castes, and slavery in Puerto Rico citing laws that make poor black men inferior. As a black man living in Puerto Rico, he often wrote about how unfairly he and his fellow men were treated. This Essay is the best known work of Figueroa. =Don Mamerto= Figueroa also wrote the zarzuela, \\"Don Mamerto\\" in 1886, which was presented at the Teatro La Perla in Ponce, Puerto Rico with music by the Ponce composer, Juan Morel Campos. This work was a scathing satire of those who betray their ideals because of political opportunism, or by being blinded by materialism or social aspirations.  Emigration and Politics  Sotero Figueroa (3rd standing, L-to-R) shown with the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York in 1895 Figueroa emigrated to the city of New York in 1889. Arriving in New York City, he joined the Antillean separatist movement and established a close friendship with the exiled Cuban patriot, Jos√© Mart√≠. There he met several other Puerto Rican patriots involved in the separatist movement, among them Francisco Gonzalo (Pach√≠n) Mar√≠n and Arturo Alfonso Schomburg. Sotero Figueroa‚Äôs writings were also tied to his political beliefs. Figueroa, Ram√≥n Mar√≠n, and Francisco Gonzalo (Pach√≠n) Mar√≠n together worked to reform politics in Puerto Rico in the late 1800s. Their mission was make equality a reality by expelling the ideals of rank and class and promoting instead a focus on ‚Äúindividual merit‚Äù. They believed that castes that existed were put on the public by Spanish colonial control and limited the Puerto Rican population‚Äôs growth economically, politically, and physically. At age 22, Figueroa was chosen as an assembly leader under Rafael Primo de Rivera, the new liberal Governor of Puerto Rico. In 1892, he collaborated in the founding of the Borinquen Club, the first of several Puerto Rican clubs affiliated with the Cuban Revolutionary Party (PRC). The PRC was founded by Jos√© Mart√≠ that same year to promote the independence of Cuba. Figueroa would later become secretary of the Executive Board of the PRC.

The concept of storing carbon dioxide in the ocean was first proposed by Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti in his 1976 paper \\"On Geoengineering and the carbon dioxide problem.\\" Since then, the concept of sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide in the world's oceans has been investigated by scientists, engineers, and environmental activists. 39,000 GtC (gigatonnes of carbon) currently reside in the oceans while only 750 GtC are in the atmosphere. Of the 1300 Gt carbon dioxide from anthropogenic emissions over the last 200 years, about 38% of that has already gone into the oceans. Carbon dioxide is currently emitted at 10 GtC per year and the oceans currently absorb 2.4 Gt carbon dioxide per year. The ocean is an enormous carbon sink with the capacity to hold thousands more gigatons of carbon dioxide. Ocean sequestration has the potential to decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations according to some scientists. __TOC__ Ocean chemistry thumb After atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolves into the ocean, the aqueous carbon dioxide reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid.Adams, E. Eric, and Ken Caldeira. ‚ÄúOcean Storage of CO2.‚Äù Elements, vol. 4, October 2008, pp. 319‚Äì324., doi:10.2113/gselements.4.5.319. As carbonic acid continues to interact with water molecules, carbonate is formed, which increases the concentration of hydrogen ions in the ocean and consequently reduces ocean pH. Therefore, increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere decreases ocean pH.Caldeira, Ken, et al. ‚ÄúIPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage: Ocean Storage.‚Äù International Panel on Climate Change, 2005. However, calcium carbonate acts as a buffer to large decreases in pH. As pH decreases, calcium carbonate dissolution increases. The IPCC uses 0.1 pH as a marker for acceptable change in ocean pH comparable to natural pH fluctuations without noticeable environmental effects. With a 0.1 pH change, the IPCC estimates that 1000 GT of carbon could be stored in the ocean and decrease negative environmental effects if the same quantity of carbon remained in the atmosphere. If carbon dioxide remained in the atmosphere, the resulting change in ocean pH would also be similar as ocean mixing would eventually absorb excess carbon dioxide.  Dilute carbon dioxide injection and storage  Dilute carbon dioxide injection requires injection at depths where carbon dioxide can be dispersed by ocean currents and ocean mixing. Upon injection, waters interact and mix based on density and dilute the concentration of carbon dioxide. Boat based carbon dioxide injection distributes low carbon dioxide concentrations in open waters while moving to increase carbon dioxide dispersal area. carbon dioxide dispersal via boat can also occur by a pipe attached to the ship injecting a dilute carbon dioxide mixture into the water column. The carbon dioxide is usually injected at 1000 m depth to reduce carbon dioxide bubble escape. As injected carbon dioxide bubbles rise, dispersal increases up the water column. Large dispersal areas and low concentrations of carbon dioxide significantly decrease any significant changes in local pH and resulting effects on marine ecosystems. Wickett et al. used measurements in natural pH fluctuations from atmospheric carbon dioxide to suggest that dilute carbon dioxide injection at 0.37 GTC/ yr would have a negligible effect on ocean pH. Dilute ocean injection requires little infrastructure in comparison to other forms of ocean injection. The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D; Programme estimates that dilute carbon dioxide injection would cost $70 per tonne of carbon dioxide including costs of carbon capture, transport, and storage before boat dispersal.  Release of solid carbon dioxide at depth  Carbon dioxide ocean storage can occur through solid or solid hydrate of carbon dioxide. The solid state density of carbon dioxide is approximately 1.5 times greater than seawater and thus tends to sink to the ocean floor. The dissolving rate at the surface is about 0.2 cm/hr such that a small quantity of carbon dioxide can be completely dissolved before reaching the sea floor. In addition to solid carbon dioxide injection, carbon dioxide hydrate is another popular method for storage. Hydrate formation takes place when the dissolved concentration of liquid carbon dioxide is around 30% and 400 meters below sea level. Hydrates form as an external layer around liquid carbon dioxide droplets or as a solid mass. The molecular composition is composed of carbon dioxide and water, carbon dioxide‚Ä¢nH2O (n ‚âà 5.75). The resulting density is denser than seawater by approximately 10%. Compared to liquid carbon dioxide, the hydrate form dissolves significantly slower in seawater, at about 0.2 cm/hr as well. Additionally, the hydrate remains immobile on the seafloor and forms hydrate cap, forcing liquid carbon dioxide to only move laterally. The overall molecular stability relies on the temperature and pressure of the environment, and hydrates only dissociate when placed in direct contact with additional heat and water at concentrations below its equilibrium concentration. However, due to its crystalline structure, pure hydrate doesn't travel through pipes. Given that 100% efficiency is extremely difficult to achieve, in reality, both laboratory and field experiments suggest that sinking reaction efficiency is approximately 15-25%. Any kind of instability of hydrates is likely to cause dissolution and dispersion during the descending or injection process.  Mineralization and deep sea sediments  Similar to mineralization processes that takes place within rocks, mineralization can also occur under the sea. The rate of dissolution of carbon dioxide from atmosphere to oceanic regions relies upon the circulation period of the ocean and buffering ability of subducting surface water. Researches have demonstrated that the carbon dioxide marine storage at several kilometers deep could be viable for up to 500 years, but is dependent on injection site and conditions. Several studies have shown that although it may fix carbon dioxide effect, carbon dioxide may be released back to the atmosphere over time. However, this is unlikely for at least a few more centuries. The neutralization of CaCO3, or balancing the concentration of CaCO3 on the seafloor, land and in the ocean, can be measured on a timescale of thousands of years. More specifically, the predicted time is 1700 years for ocean and approximately 5000 to 6000 years for land. Further, the dissolution time for CaCo3 can be improved by injecting near or downstream of the storage site. In addition to carbon mineralization, another proposal is deep sea sediment injection. It injects liquid carbon at least 3000 m below the surface directly into ocean sediments to generate carbon dioxide hydrate. Two regions are defined for exploration: the negative buoyancy zone (NBZ), which is the region between liquid carbon dioxide denser than surrounding water and where liquid carbon dioxide has neutral buoyancy, and hydrate formation zone (HFZ), which typically has low temperatures and high pressures. Several research models have shown that the optimal depth of injection requires consideration of intrinsic permeability and any changes in liquid carbon dioxide permeability for optimal storage. The formation of hydrates decreases liquid carbon dioxide permeability, and injection below HFZ is more energetically favored than within the HFZ. If the NBZ is a greater column of water than the HFZ, the injection should happen below the HFZ and directly to the NBZ. In this case, liquid carbon dioxide will sink to the NBZ and be stored below the buoyancy and hydrate cap. Carbon dioxide leakage can occur if there is dissolution into pore fluid or via molecular diffusion. However, this occurs over thousands of years.  Carbon dioxide plumes  Researchers have been able to show in lab and in small in situ experiments that carbon dioxide can be injected into oceans as rising or sinking plumes. The plume will sink if it is more dense than seawater. This should occur if the plume, a mix of carbon dioxide and seawater, is injected at depths of 3 km. As the plume moves vertically, it will dissolve at least partially due to convective mass transfer with the passing seawater. Dissolution is increased by increased currents perpendicular to the vertical water column containing the plume because of the increase convective mass transfer. For sinking plumes, minimal horizontal currents are desired so that the plume can sink to the ocean floor for longer term sequestration. The opposite is desired for rising plumes, which similarly to other previously mentioned dilute ocean storage techniques, relies on the dispersal to make the change in carbon dioxide concentration in the ocean low enough to not affect the marine biosphere significantly. The proposed method of injection is droplets of supercritical carbon dioxide mixed with seawater. Plumes can be engineered to dissolve at different rates based on the size, concentration, and rate of injection of the carbon dioxide/seawater droplets. For rising plumes which rely on dissolution to sequester carbon dioxide, a smaller droplet with a greater rate of injection is better because it leads to faster dissolution. Sinking plumes ideally form lakes of carbon dioxide on the ocean floor for more long term sequestration.  Carbon dioxide lakes  Carbon dioxide lakes will form on ocean floors in depressions or trenches in the seabed. These lakes sequester carbon dioxide through isolation. The deep ocean has a very slow rate of mixing with the surface ocean. Additionally, the surface of the carbon dioxide lake will form a layer of crystal hydrates that will slow dissolution of carbon dioxide into the above ocean. Convective motion over the surface of the lake due to ocean bottom storms or normal sea currents will increase dissolution. Without any bulk flow over the lake, the storage timeline of the carbon dioxide is 10,000 years for a 50 m deep lake. This number is decreased by more than 25 times with currents from ocean bottom storms. Sites would be chosen based on ocean floor depth, seismic and volcanic activity, and the presence of CaCO3 deposits that could increase the rate of carbon mineralization. Some sites proposed for storage at depths greater than 6 km include the Indonesian Sunda trench, the Japanese Ryukyu trench, and the Puerto Rico trench. Environmental impacts of deep-sea ocean sequestration Researchers are studying how ecosystems are affected before and after injection of liquid carbon dioxide through \\"process studies, surveys of biogeochemical tracers, and ocean bottom studies.\\"IPCC, 2005: IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage. Prepared by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Metz, B., O. Davidson, H. C. de Coninck, M. Loos, and L. A. Meyer (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, 442 pp. The challenge comes from the spatial range of the ocean and the time-scale at which effects would be taking place, making it difficult to detect these effects precisely. There is very limited knowledge as to what organisms and ecosystems exist in this unexplored area and the interdependence of such ecosystems. The following is specifically pertaining to deep ocean sequestration through dilute injection, but touches on alternate methods (injection by towed pipeline, injection by stationary pipeline, use of hydrates). Due to the size of the ocean, the predictions and conclusions regarding the environmental risk of this sequestration process are based on small-scale experiments that have been extrapolated to show possible results on a scale as large as the ocean. =Deep sea biota= Ocean sequestration in deep sea sediments has the potential to impact deep sea life. The chemical and physical composition of the deep sea does not undergo changes in the way that surface waters do. Due to its limited contact with the atmosphere, most organisms have evolved with very little physical and chemical disturbance and exposed to minimal levels of carbon dioxide. Most of their energy is obtained from feeding off of particulate matter that descends from the surface water of the ocean and its ecosystems. Deep sea ecosystems do not have rapid reproduction rates nor give birth to many offspring because of their limited access to oxygen and nutrients. In particular, species that inhabit the 2000-3000m deep range of the ocean have small, diverse populations. Introducing lethal amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment of such a species can have a serious impact on the population size and will take longer to recover relative to surface water species. = Effects of pH vs. carbon dioxide= Acidification of the environment weakens metabolic processes in organisms; enzymes and ion transportation require specific pH levels to continue functioning properly. However, organisms are not only affected by the acidification of water in the presence of heightened carbon dioxide (carbon dioxide) levels. carbon dioxide itself interacts with the physiological function of individual organisms. These effects are more damaging than those associated with changes in pH of environment. When carbon dioxide enters organisms, through diffusion across tissue, it becomes internally accumulated which can then cause anesthesia and, depending on the concentration of carbon dioxide, death. The internal accumulation will also cause organisms to experience blood acidification. This weakens organisms' ability to uptake oxygen and consequently weakens their performances. This effect is more so detrimental to more complex and larger species that require a greater exertion of energy to move and perform vital bodily functions. =Long term effects= If deep-sea ocean sequestration becomes a common practice, long term effects will continue to be investigated to predict future scenarios of deep sea impacts by carbon dioxide. Ocean sequestration of liquid carbon dioxide would not only impact deep-sea ecosystems, but in the long-run would begin to affect surface-water species. It is estimated that organisms not fit for high carbon dioxide levels will begin to experience permanent effects at levels of 400/500ppm of carbon dioxide and/or shifts of 0.1-0.3 units in pH. These levels of carbon dioxide are predicted to be met solely as a result of atmospheric carbon dioxide acidifying the surface waters over a matter of a century, without considering ocean sequestration effects. Although the long- term effects are the most relevant to understand, they are also the most difficult to predict accurately due to the scale of the ocean and the diversity in species sensitivity to elevated carbon dioxide levels. Surface sea organisms have been better studied than deep-sea animals in terms of consequences due to prolonged carbon dioxide exposure and have been proven to experience \\"reduced calcification\\" and damage to their skeletons. This more seriously affects shelled animals' mortality and growth rate. Adult fish showed remarkable tolerance to elevated carbon dioxide levels, only when dissolution of carbon dioxide occurred at a slow rate. Developing fish showed less tolerance than their adult fish counterparts. Acidification of the blood in these species also results in weakened metabolic rates; this stunts protein formation and thus hinders growth and reproduction of organisms. Although individual physiological effects are known, in order to understand how these individual species are interconnected and dependent of each other, field studies would have to be conducted. Different amounts and concentrations of sequestered carbon dioxide will affect each ecosystem and species differently such that a general, universal limit of carbon dioxide to be sequestered doesn't exist. Corporations in favor of ocean sequestration, such as ExxonMobil,Supran, Geoffrey. Oreskes, Naomi \\"Assessing ExxonMobil's climate change communications\\" Environmental Research Letters. (1977-2014) (http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/12/8/084019) argue that the uncertainties involved with such predictions instill doubt in the conclusions of the research. Supporters of ocean sequestration argue that because of the ocean's size, diluted carbon dioxide injections will not be enough to create an actual impact on ecosystems and that species can evolve to these increased levels of carbon dioxide eventually. Scientific research shows that sites of injection are spatially specific and ecosystems that happen to inhabit the site of injection can suffer immediate consequences. Affected areas will experience acidification, due to the augmented bicarbonate levels, and in turn a decrease in calcium carbonate levels. This will cause sediments and shells of organisms to more quickly dissolve. The capacity of deep-sea organisms to acclimate to the injection of carbon dioxide has not been investigated and the hypothesis that they will evolve in time lacks scientific support. = Minimal impact methods = The use of clathrate hydrates can be implemented in order to reduce speed of dissolution of carbon dioxide.Brewer, Peter G. \\"Direct Injection of Carbon Dioxide into the Oceans.\\" The Carbon Dioxide Dilemma: Promising Technlogoies and Policies. (2003) The hydrates give carbon dioxide a negative buoyancy, allowing injection to occur at surface levels rather than through pipelines. Experiments showed that the use of clathrate hydrates minimized the rate at which the injected carbon dioxide spread throughout the ocean floor.Israelsson, Peter. Chow, Aaron. Adams, Eric. \\"An updated assessment of the acute impacts of ocean carbon sequestration by direct injection.\\" Energy Procedia. 2009https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2009.02.324 This rate proved to minimize impact on deep sea organisms. The intactness of the hydrates relies heavily on the ocean current's magnitude at the site of injection. The carbon dioxide dissolved into surface waters before the hydrate was able to sink to the deep ocean (10%-55% of carbon dioxide remained stuck to the hydrate at depths of 1500m into the ocean). In laboratory experiments, continuous streams of hydrates have not yet been achieved. Studies show that delivering liquid carbon dioxide by a towed pipeline (attached to boat traveling perpendicular to the current), can minimize \\"clumps\\" of highly concentrated carbon dioxide levels. Delivery by fixed pipe would be confined to a small region of the ocean and in turn instantly kill sensitive species inhabiting the region. Theoretically, if we assume future anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide drop drastically and only 0.37 Gt of liquid carbon dioxide were to be injected each year through a towed pipe, only 1% of the ocean would be affected. There is consensus among scientists that ocean sequestration of carbon dioxide is not a long-term plan to be relied on, but may solve immediate atmospheric concerns if implemented temporarily. Scientists believe that it is possible to engineer ways to discharge carbon dioxide at rates that resemble the natural fluctuation of carbon dioxide in the oceans.  Blue carbon capture in ocean  Carbon cycle diagram showing the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere. Ocean storage refers to the use of large water bodies and marine lifeforms to capture carbon by exploiting natural and geological mechanisms. Oceans cover slightly more than 70% of the total surface area of the Earth, and plays a major role in helping to stabilize Earth's climate. This presents itself as a readily available carbon sink to store and capture atmospheric carbon dioxide. Due to the solubility of carbon dioxide in water, CO2 naturally dissolves in oceanic waters to form an equilibrium. With an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the position of equilibrium pushes the equilibrium in the direction such that more CO2 dissolves into the water. Utilizing this mechanism, more than 500 Gtons of carbon dioxide (amounting to a total of 140 Gtons of carbon) of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions released over the past 2 centuries have been absorbed by the oceans. With increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations released due to human activities as compared to levels before the Industrialization, oceans are currently absorbing 7 Gt carbon dioxide per annum.https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special- reports/srccs/srccs_chapter6.pdf To enhance the natural mechanism of CO2 dissolving in water, several methods have been proposed by the scientific community. These include the use of iron fertilization, urea fertilization, mixing layers, seaweed,De Vooys, 1979; Raven and Falkowski, 1999; Falkowski et al., 2000; Pelejero et al., 2010 as well as direct carbon injection into the sea floor  Iron fertilization = Role of iron in carbon sequestration = Ocean iron fertilization is an example of a geoengineering technique that involves intentional introduction of iron-rich deposits into oceans and is aimed to enhance biological productivity of organisms in ocean waters in order to increase carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake from the atmosphere, possibly resulting in mitigating its global warming effects. Iron is a trace element in ocean and its presence is vital for photosynthesis in plants, and in particular phytoplanktons, as It has been shown that iron deficiency can limit ocean productivity and phytoplankton growth. For this reason, ‚Äúiron hypothesis‚Äù was put forward by Martin in late 1980s where he suggested that changes in iron supply in iron-deficient ocean-waters can bloom plankton growth and have a significant effect on the concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide by altering rates of carbon sequestration. In fact, fertilization is an important process that occurs naturally in the ocean waters. For instance, upwellings of ocean currents can bring nutrient-rich sediments to the surface. Another example is through transfer of iron-rich minerals, dust, and volcanic ash over long distances by rivers, glaciers, or wind. Moreover, it has been suggested that whales can transfer iron-rich ocean dust to the surface, where planktons can take it up to grow. It has been shown that reduction in the number of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean has resulted in a 200,000 tonnes/yr decrease in the atmospheric carbon uptake, possibly due to limited phytoplankton growth. = Carbon sequestration by phytoplankton = An oceanic phytoplankton bloom in the North Sea off the coast of eastern Scotland. Phytoplankton is photosynthetic: it needs sunlight and nutrients to grow, and takes up carbon dioxide in the process. Plankton can take up and sequester atmospheric carbon through generating calcium or silicon-carbonate skeletons. When these organisms die they sink to the ocean floor where their carbonate skeletons can form a major component of the carbon-rich deep sea precipitation, thousands of meters below plankton blooms, known as marine snow. Nonetheless, based on the definition, carbon is only considered \\"sequestered\\" when it is deposited in the ocean floor where it can be retained for millions of years. However, most of the carbon-rich biomass generated from plankton is generally consumed by other organisms (small fish, zooplankton, etc.) and substantial part of rest of the deposits that sink beneath plankton blooms may be re-dissolved in the water and gets transferred to the surface where it eventually returns to the atmosphere, thus, nullifying any possible intended effects regarding carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, supporters of the idea of iron fertilization believe that carbon sequestration should be re-defined over much shorter time frames and claim that since the carbon is suspended in the deep ocean it is effectively isolated from the atmosphere for hundreds of years, and thus, carbon can be effectively sequestered. = Efficiency and concerns = Assuming the ideal conditions, the upper estimates for possible effects of iron fertilization in slowing down global warming is about 0.3W/m2 of averaged negative forcing which can offset roughly 15-20% of the current anthropogenic CO2emissions. However, although this approach could be looked upon as an alternative, easy route, to solving our carbon emission crisis and lower concentration of CO2in the atmosphere, ocean iron fertilization is still quite controversial and highly debated due to possible negative consequences on the marine ecosystem. Research on this area has suggested that fertilization through deposition of large quantities of iron-rich dust into the ocean floor can significantly disrupt ocean's nutrient balance and cause major complications in the food cycle for other marine organisms. Since 1990, 13 major large scale experiments have been carried out to evaluate efficiency and possible consequences of the iron fertilization in ocean waters. A recent research conducted on these experiments determined that the method is unproven; sequestering efficiency is low and sometimes no effect was seen and the amount of iron deposits that is needed to make a small cut in the carbon emissions is in the million tons per year.  Urea fertilization  According to Ramsay et al., urea fertilization could cause damage to the rich marine biodiversity of the Sulu sea (including its coral reefs). In waters with sufficient iron micro nutrients, but a deficit of nitrogen, urea fertilization is the better choice for algae growth. Urea is the most used fertilizer in the world, due to its high content of nitrogen, low cost and high reactivity towards water. When exposed to ocean waters, urea is metabolized by phytoplankton via urease enzymes to produce ammonia.CO(NH_2)_2 + H_2O ->[urease] NH_3 + NH_2COOH NH_2COOH + H_2O -> NH_3 + H_2CO_3 The intermediate product carbamate also reacts with water to produce a total of two ammonia molecules. In 2007 the 'Ocean Nourishment Corporation of Sydney' initiated an experiment in the Sulu sea (southwest of the Philippines), were 1000 tons of urea was injected into the ocean. The goal was to prove that urea fertilization would enrich the algae growth in the ocean, and thereby capture CO2 from the atmosphere. This project was criticized by many institutions, including the European Commission, due to lack of knowledge of side effects on the marine ecosystem. Results from this project are still to be published in literature. Another cause of concern is the sheer amount of urea needed to capture the same amount of carbon as eq. iron fertilization. The nitrogen to iron ratio in a typical algae cell is 16:0.0001, meaning that for every iron atom added to the ocean a substantial larger amount of carbon is captured compared to adding one atom of nitrogen. Scientists also emphasize that adding urea to ocean waters could reduce oxygen content and result in a rise of toxic marine algae. This could potentially have devastating effects on fish populations, which others argue would be benefiting from the urea fertilization (the argument being that fish populations would feed on healthy phytoplankton.  Seaweed fertilization  In order to mitigate global warming, seaweed farming is both a possible and plausible way. This method was adopted in early ocean algae proposals to mitigate global warming. This is done through commercial kelp farms designed to take up tens of thousands of square kilometres of the open ocean. Through this method, seaweed beds will perform as an effective sinks by decreasing the level of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the ocean. Seaweed in Ensenada, Baja California. Seaweeds do the above by removing carbon through the process of photosynthesis, taking in excess CO2 and producing O2. Facts and figures have shown that 0.7 million tonnes of carbon are removed from the sea each year by commercially harvested seaweeds. Even though seaweed biomass is small as compared to the coastal region. They remain essential due to their biotic components, the ability to provide valuable ecosystem services and high primary productivity. Seaweeds are different from mangroves and seagrasses, they are photosynthetic algal organisms and non-flowering. Even so, they are primary producers that grows in the same way as their terrestrial counterparts, both of which assimilate carbon by the process of photosynthesis and generates new biomass by taking up phosphorus, nitrogen, and other minerals. The attractiveness of large-scale seaweed cultivation is proven over the years, with low-cost technologies and the multiple uses that can be made of its products. Today, seaweed farming made up approximately 25% of the world's aquaculture production and its maximum potential has not been utilised. Currently in the world, seaweeds contributes approximately 16‚Äì18.7% of the total marine-vegetation sink. In 2010 there are 19.2 √ó 10^6 tons of aquatic plants worldwide, 6.8 √ó 10^6 tons for brown seaweeds; 9.0 √ó 10^6 tons for red seaweeds; 0.2 √ó 10^6 tons of green seaweeds; and 3.2 √ó 10^6 tons of miscellaneous aquatic plants. Seaweed is largely transported from coastal areas to the open and deep ocean, acting as a permanent storage of carbon biomass within marine sediments.  Mixing layers  Mixing layers involve transporting the denser and colder deep ocean water to the surface mixed layer. As the temperature of water in the ocean decreases with depth, more carbon dioxide and other compounds are able to dissolve in the deeper layers. This can be induced by reversing the oceanic carbon cycle through the use of large vertical pipes serving as ocean pumps, or a mixer array. When the nutrient rich deep ocean water is moved to the surface, algae bloom occurs, resulting in a decrease in carbon dioxide due to carbon intake from Phytoplankton and other photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms. The transfer of heat between the layers will also cause seawater from the mixed layer to sink and absorb more carbon dioxide. This method has not gained much traction as algae bloom harms marine ecosystems by blocking sunlight and releasing harmful toxins into the ocean. The sudden increase in carbon dioxide on the surface level will also temporarily decrease the pH of the seawater, impairing the growth of coral reefs. The production of carbonic acid through the dissolution of carbon dioxide in seawater hinders marine biogenic calcification and causes major disruptions to the oceanic food chain.

Act I The Royal Park A marriage has been arranged between Mica√´la, the King's daughter, and Don Ga√´tan, Crown Prince of a neighbouring country. Mica√´la is not enamoured of palace life and escapes when possible to join her friend Jos√©fa, the gardener. Ga√´tan arrives, angry at being forced into an arranged marriage. He is of a romantic disposition and wants a love-match. He escapes the discreet supervision to which he is subject; the King orders that he be sought and found promptly. Ga√´tan evades those looking for him and emerges from his hiding place. He meets Mica√´la who, wearing Jos√©fa's clothes, passes for a gardener. They are immediately attracted to each other. Ga√´tan tells Mica√´la that he is doomed to marry the princess for reasons of state, but will not even look at her during the whole ceremony. There are noises off, and Ga√´tan has only time to declare his love to Mica√´la. She flees and the King appears, pleased to have tracked down his future son-in-law. Act II A Great Hall of the Royal Palace Scene from original production, 1882 It is the day of the wedding. On the same day Jos√©fa has married her lover, Moral√®s. Faithful to his promise, Ga√´tan declines to look at Mica√´la during the service or to dance with her afterwards. He cannot escape from the palace as all doors are guarded, but he is determined not to consummate his marriage. Trying to cause a scandal to wreck the marriage he makes a pass at Mica√´la's formidable duenna, expecting her to make a tremendous fuss, and he is horrified when she responds eagerly. He evades her. Jos√©fa's wedding night seems to be as unpromising as Ga√´tan's. Her new husband, Moral√®s, is in charge of the palace guard, and cannot leave the premises to join his bride. Finding Mica√´la's and Ga√´tan's nuptial chamber unoccupied Jos√©fa and Moral√®s yield to the temptation to put it to use themselves. The King, snooping in the hope of hearing evidence that the royal marriage is proceeding as he hoped, overhears Mica√´la's and Ga√´tan's billing and cooing and happily assumes that his plans are succeeding. Ga√´tan returns and meets Micaela, once again disguised as a gardener. Their encounter rapidly becomes amorous and they embrace. Act III A camp, Ga√´tan's headquarters During a grand military manoeuvre, Mica√´la and her suite have retired to a nearby convent. She frequently absents herself to be with Ga√´tan, who still thinks she is a gardener. The King comes to tell Ga√´tan that the princess is pregnant. Ga√´tan is puzzled. Moral√®s apologises to him for having, on the wedding night, used the nuptial chamber for personal purposes, and Ga√´tan now thinks he knows who is the father of the future Crown Prince. Everything becomes clear when Mica√´la enters, no longer in disguise. Ga√´tan realises he has unknowingly married the women he loves. The soldiers fire a salute to the unborn heir and the opera ends in general rejoicing. ::Source: Acad√©mie Nationale de l'Op√©rette.

Source: Vocal score.Lecocq, introductory page Revivals and adaptations Two rival productions of the opera were seen in New York in February 1883, under the titles Hand and Heart and Mica√´la. There were two further revivals in New York in 1883 and 1884. The work was not seen in London until ten years after its Paris premiere. It was presented in a heavily revised form as Incognita in October 1892. F. C. Burnand revised the book, Harry Greenbank wrote new lyrics, and there were musical contributions from Isaac Alb√©niz in Act II, and Hamilton Clarke, Alfred Moul and the conductor of the production, Herbert Bunning, in Act III.Clark, p. 85 In their 1988 study of musical theatre Kurt G√§nzl and Andrew Lamb record no further performances of the piece, in Paris or anywhere else. Lamb, writing in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, counts it the last of Lecocq's real successes. Critical response Lecocq's view of Le coeur et la main was: > A nice piece whose first two acts are the best. The third has never > satisfied me. The success was very great, and Madame Vaillant-Couturier, an > excellent singer, a very pretty woman, who was making her debut in operetta, > made an excellent impression. All the roles were well played, the staging > admirable, and I count this work among my most successful. In spite of the > excellent box-office takings, the director of the theatre, for > administrative reasons known to him, abruptly interrupted the run after the > hundredth performance to stage another piece. According to the critical consensus, at the time and subsequently, Le coeur et la main is too noticeably similar to its predecessors, musically and dramatically. In his survey of operetta (2016), Richard Traubner concurs with the composer's view that the third act is weak, and remarks on \\"a tendency to bawdiness\\" that had not marred Lecocq's previous works, and a lack of the composer's earlier \\"melodic sparkle\\".Traubner, p. 79 References and sources ;References ;Sources  1882 operas French- language operas Operas by Charles Lecocq Operas ","title":"Le coeur et la main"},{"id":"59013283","text":"Trebnje Castle is a smaller castle located in a Slovenian town Trebnje, positioned on a plateau on the right bank of river Temenica. Sources claim that the castle was built around year 1000, which makes it one of the oldest Slovenian castles.[1] The castle has changed several owners over the years, ranging from local nobility, Habsburgs, and a missionary Frederick Baraga. Today, while the castle's fate remains uncertain, its condition is visibly deteriorating.  History  It is believed that the castle was built around year 1000 by the Patriarchate of Aquileia and managed by their local vassal knights named de Treuen. Records attest that the castle's first vassal was Konrad de Treuen, who was then followed by Bernard, Henrik and Ulrik de Treuen between the years 1243 and 1245. A record from 1349 mentions the knight Hajncel, and Aquileian charters from 1358 refer to the knight Johannis de Treuen as the castle's overseers. First mentions of the castle however date back to 1386 and 1436, and refer to it as Turn ze Treuen and turn zu Trefen mit dem purkchstal vnd dem pawhof, respectively. According to a historian Valvasor, after the decline of knights of Treuen, the castle's ownership first passed to Counts of Ortenburg, and then to Counts of Celje, who owned the castle until 1456. With the demise of Counts of Celje, the castle was handed over to the Habsburgs as part of an inheritance agreement. Valvasor's Topographia Ducatus Carnioliae modernae from 1679 In the Early modern period the castle changed several hands. Written recordings list the following owners: * 1601: Gabrijel Kri≈æaniƒç; * 1652: Jurij Jankoviƒç; * 1679: Wolf Konrad Jankoviƒç; * 1685: Matej Kowatschitsch pl. Schmiedhofen, who was a toll collector of provincial tollhouses in Jesenice and imperial tollhouse; * 1699: Stiƒçna Abbey; * 1731: Jankoviƒç family; * 1734: Jo≈æef Mihael pl. Wallensberg; * 1767: Filip Mihael pl. Wallensberg, a son of Jo≈æef Mihael pl. Wallensberg; * 1799: Janez Nepomuk Baraga; * 1812: Frederick Baraga, a missionary and a son of Janez Nepomuk Baraga; * 1824: Jo≈æek Gressel, a brother in law of Frederick Baraga; * 1842: Anamalija Gressel, the wife of Jo≈æek Gressel; * 1869: Karel Gressel, a son of Ana Malija and Jo≈æek Gressel; * 1863: Marija Gressel, a widow after Karel Gressel; * 1896: Matija Hoƒçevar and Franc Hren. The last owner before the Second World War was a Czeck Evgen Evgen ≈†oulavy, after the war the castle was nationalized. For some time, the castle hosted the Trebnje primary school; later it was turned into social housing. Today, the castle is again in private hands.  Architecture  Historians believe that the castle was initially built as an unfortified tower. Later, in 1530, the tower needed to be significantly fortified because of the threat of Turkish invasions. It was re-made in a massive renaissance four-tract building with three quadrangle and one circular tower. Today, the castle comprises four one-floor living areas that surround rectangular inner courtyard. Three corners of the courtyard are strengthened with towers. One enters the castle through a spacious, arched slit with two baroque portals on the left and the right. The courtyard is enclosed with arcades. The arcades on the left, nordern side of the courtyard are hexagonal, supported by load-bearing walls and in the size of the ground floor. A taller set of arcades leads to a staircase that connects the ground floor with the upper floor. Arcades of the eastern area are also hexagonal and supported by the load-bearing walls. Compared to the load-bearing wall on the northern side, these walls are placed in bigger intervals, causing arches to be pent-in instead of semicircular. Both southern and eastern arcades of the courtyard are walled. Pillars of the arcades are circular. It hasn't been determined yet whether the castle incorporates any construction elements from the Middle ages. During a probing inspection, researchers found remains of 2.36m-thick foundation of an unidentified wall south of the wall, and remains of a 10m-wide moat with an adjacent external trench.

His most important field of work was physical geodesy, where he worked after his dissertation on earth tides with geophysical measurements up to global models of the earth gravity field.  Life and career  Hans-Georg Wenzel was born on 3 February 1945 in Hahnenklee- Bockswiese. From 1962 to 1964 Wenzel trained as a surveying technician. Until 1967 he studied surveying at the Staatliche Ingenieurschule f√ºr Bauwesen in Essen and at the Technische Hochschule Hannover, which he graduated in 1972 with a Dipl.-Ing. degree. He then worked at the Institute for Geodesy at Leibniz University Hannover, first as a scientific assistant, later as a scientific assistant, chief engineer and finally as an academic councilor. In 1985 he habilitated with his thesis Hochaufl√∂sende Kugelfunktionsmodelle f√ºr das Gravitationspotential der Erde (High Resolution Spherical Harmonic Models for the Gravitational Potential of the Earth). In 1988 he was appointed Professor of Gravimetry and Geodynamics at the Geodetic Institute of the University of Karlsruhe and Director of the Geophysical Observatory in Schiltach in the Black Forest.

MicroED is a form of electron crystallography where thin 3D crystals are used for structure determination by electron diffraction. The method was developed for structure determination of proteins from nanocrystals that are typically not suitable for X-ray diffraction because of their size. Crystals that are one billionth the size needed for X-ray crystallography can yield high quality data. The samples are frozen hydrated as for all other CryoEM modalities but instead of using the transmission electron microscope (TEM) in imaging mode one uses it in diffraction mode with an extremely low electron exposure (typically < 0.01 e‚àí/√Ö2/s). The nano crystal is exposed to the diffracting beam and continuously rotated while diffraction is collected on a fast camera as a movie. MicroED data is then processed using traditional software for X-ray crystallography without the need for specialized software for structure analysis and refinement. Importantly, both the hardware and software used in a MicroED experiment are standard and broadly available.  Development  The first successful demonstration of MicroED was reported in 2013 by the Gonen laboratory. The structure of lysozyme, a classic test protein in X-ray crystallography. Earlier in 2013, the Abrahams group independently reported 3D electron diffraction data using a Medipix quantum area detector on lysozyme crystals but were unable to solve the structure due to technical limitations. Experimental setup Detailed protocols for setting up the electron microscope and for data collections have been published. = Instrumentation = Microscope  MicroED data is collected using transmission electron (cryogenic) microscopy. The microscope must be equipped with a selected area aperture to use selected area diffraction.  Detectors  A variety of detectors have been used to collected electron diffraction data in MicroED experiments. Detectors utilizing charge-coupled device (CCD) and complementary metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (CMOS) technology have been used. With CMOS detectors, individual electron counts can be interpreted.See also https://www.gatan.com/ccd-vs-cmos and https://www.gatan.com/techniques/imaging. = Data collection =Still diffraction The initial proof of concept publication on MicroED used lysozyme crystals. Up to 90 degrees of data were collected from a single nano crystal, with discrete 1 degree steps between frames. Each diffraction pattern was collected with an ultra-low dose rate of ‚àº0.01 e‚àí/√Ö2/s. Data from 3 crystals was merged to yield a 2.9√Ö resolution structure with good refinement statistics, and represented the first time electron diffraction had been used successfully to determine the structure of a dose-sensitive protein from 3D microcrystals in cryogenic conditions. Continuous stage rotation Shortly after the proof of principle paper MicroED was improved by applying continuous rotation during the data collection scheme. Here the crystal is slowly rotated in a single direction while diffraction is recorded on a fast camera as a movie. The methodology is like the rotation method in x-ray crystallography. This led to several improvements in data quality and allowed data processing using standard X-ray crystallographic software. Benefits of continuous rotation MicroED include a decrease in dynamical scattering and improved sampling of reciprocal space. Continuous-rotation is the standard method of MicroED data collection since 2014. =Data processing= Detailed protocols for MicroED data processing have been published. When MicroED data is collected using continuous stage rotation, standard crystallography software can be used. Differences between MicroED and other electron diffraction methods Other electron diffraction methods that have been developed for material science of radiation insensitive material like inorganic salts include Automated Diffraction Tomography (ADT) and Rotation Electron Diffraction (RED). These methods significantly differ from MicroED: In ADT discrete steps of goniometer tilt are used to cover reciprocal space in combination with beam precession to fill in the gaps. ADT uses specialized hardware for precession and scanning transmission electron microscopy for crystal tracking. RED is done in TEM but the goniometer is coarsely tilted in discrete steps and beam tilting is used to fill in the gaps. Specialized software is used to process ADT and RED data. Importantly, ADT and RED were developed and tested on radiation insensitive inorganic materials and salts and have not been demonstrated for use with proteins or radiation sensitive organic material studied in a frozen hydrated state.  Milestones = Method scope = MicroED has been used to determine the structures of large globular proteins, small proteins, peptides, membrane proteins, organic molecules, and inorganic compounds. In many of these examples hydrogens and charged ions were observed. =Novel structures of Œ±-synuclein of Parkinson's disease = The first novel structures solved by MicroED were published in late 2015. These structures were of peptide fragments that form the toxic core of Œ±-synculein, the protein responsible for Parkinson's disease and lead to insight into the aggregation mechanism toxic aggregates. The structures were solved at 1.4 √Ö resolution. =Novel protein structure of R2lox = The first novel structure of a protein solved by MicroED was published in 2019. The protein is the metalloenzyme R2-like ligand-binding oxidase (R2lox) from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. The structure was solved at 3.0 √Ö resolution by molecular replacement using a model of 35% sequence identity built from the closest homolog with a know structure. This work demonstrated that MicroED could be used to obtain unknown structure of protein.

Early life St. John's Cathedral. Front of St. John's Cathedral. Potter was born in New York City on May 6, 1859. He was the son of Virginia (n√©e Mitchell) Potter (1827‚Äì1890) and Democratic U.S. Representative Clarkson Nott Potter (1825‚Äì1882). Among his siblings was Maria Louisa Potter, who married Joseph Leslie Cotton of Boston; Virginia Potter, who did not marry, Eleanor Potter, and Clarkson Alonzo Potter. Upon his father's death in 1882, he shared in his estate valued in excess of $1,000,000. His paternal grandparents were Sarah (n√©e Nott) Potter (daughter of Eliphalet Nott, the longest serving college president in the United States) and Alonzo Potter, the Episcopalian Bishop of Pennsylvania. His maternal grandparents were Matthew and Louisa (n√©e Kidd) Mitchell of Philadelphia. Among his many prominent relatives were uncles Howard Potter, a New York City banker, Robert Brown Potter, a General in the American Civil War, Edward Tuckerman Potter, an architect, Henry Codman Potter, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, Eliphalet Nott Potter, who served as President of Union College and Hobart College, and William Appleton Potter, also an architect who designed the Church of the Presidents in Elberon, New Jersey. Potter was educated in private schools in New York, then \\"fitted for college\\" under Dean Oliver. He entered Union College and graduated in 1881 with an A.B. degree. After Union, he went abroad for several years until he returned in 1890 to attend Columbia College to study architecture. He returned to Europe to finish his education.

The company is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as an offshore company. As of 2016, Rosewood Hotel Group was owned by Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, having acquired Rosewood Hotel Group in 2015 from Chow Tai Fook Enterprises' listed associate company New World China Land for HK$1.96 billion.

She was appointed as the executive vice-chairman of New World Hotel Management Limited in February 2009 and one of the executive director of New World China Land, the parent company at that time in January 2010. History=Predecessors= New World Hospitality and New World Hotel Management could be traced back to New World Hotel (later renamed to and demolished in the 2010s along with the rest of New World Centre) that opened in the 1980s, Hotel Victoria in Shun Tak Centre (which the hotel became defunct, the building was refurnished as an office tower), as well as the listed real estate developer New World Development and its subsidiaries New World Hotels (Holdings) and New World Hotels International Limited. The latter was incorporated in 1983. In 1987, The Harbour View Hotel (now Renaissance Harbour View Hotel) in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, was also planned to be manage by New World Development group themselves, via New World Hotels International. In parallel with the acquisition of Ramada-Renaissance Hotels in 1989, New World Development had established its own team in hotel investment and management. In the 1990s, New World Development entered Mainland China market as hotel manager. In 1990, the group managed 6 hotels in Mainland China, namely Jing- guang New World in Beijing, Yangtze New World in Shanghai, China Hotel in Guangzhou, Dragon Hotel in Hangzhou, Gui-shan Hotel in Guilin as well as New World Dynasty Hotel in Xi'an. Currently, the management contracts for those 6 hotels (except Jing-guang New World which was owned by NWD group) were no longer owned by NWD group. In 1995, NWD group split the Renaissance Hotels into two parallel subsidiaries: a hotel property holding company Hotel Property Investment (BVI) Limited and a hotel management company Renaissance Hotel Group N.V.. New World Hotels International Limited, another hotel management company of the NWD group, became a subsidiary of Renaissance Hotel Group instead. Renaissance Hotel Group became a listed company on the New York Stock Exchange on 27 September 1995. Renaissance Hotel Group also acquired the minority interest of New World Hotels International from several people that connected to NWD group, such NWD directors Stewart Leung Chi-kin, Chan Kam- ling, as well as William Doo Wai-hoi, son-in-law of the patriarch of NWD group, Cheng Yu-tung. The hotel management company Renaissance Hotel Group was sold in April 1997, for US$491 million (approx. HK$3.8 billion). The Hong Kong incorporated New World Hotels International Limited was also renamed to Renaissance Hotels International Limited in 2005 and RHIL Limited in 2007. Despite NWD group parted away from Renaissance Hotels, 2 out of 4 hotels of New World China Land (a sub-holding listed company of New World Development) in mainland China, were still managed by Renaissance's buyer Marriott International, under Courtyard brand as of 2003‚Äì04 financial year. The other two hotels were Mayfair Hotel in Shanghai (it shared the same Chinese name with department stores of sister company New World Department Store China) and New World Hotel in Shenyang. A strategic alliance was also formed with Marriott International in 1997‚Äì98 financial year. The management contracts of the Courtyard hotels of the NWD group had expired in years 2010 to 2011. The Courtyard by Marriott Beijing became pentahotel Beijing in 2010‚Äì11 financial year, while New World Courtyard Hotel, Shunde became New World Hotel Shunde. Both hotels were managed by New World Hotel Management, a unit of NWD group at that time. =New World Hotel Management= Circa 2006, New World Development group started to focus on re-expanding its own hotel management unit for new hotels of New World China Land (NWCL), as well as for those hotels that the management contract were expiring. The unit, known as New World Hotel Management Limited, was incorporated in Hong Kong in 2005.Data in Hong Kong Companies Registry The 65% stake of the parent company of the unit, New World Hotel Management (BVI) Limited, was acquired by New World China Land along with Beijing New World Property Management Limited for HK$1.404 million in August‚ÄìNovember 2006. The stake of New World Hotel Management (BVI), that owned by NWCL, was increased to 70.5% since February 2008. It reached 100% in January 2009. It was reported that the minority shareholder was William Doo, Jr., son of William Doo Wai-hoi, vice-chairman of New World China Land.

Early life and education Peirce, born in Salem, 30 September 1778, was the son of Jerahmeel and Sarah (Ropes) Peirce. After graduating from Harvard College at the head of the class of 1801, he returned to Salem and entered the India trade with his father. He was a representative to the Massachusetts General Court from Salem for several years and a Massachusetts State Senator from Essex County in 1811. Career But neither a mercantile nor a political life fully satisfied him and he was glad to accept in 1826 the position of Librarian at Harvard. He at once set about the preparation of a catalogue of the Library which was published in 1830-31 in four volumes : the first two containing an alphabetical catalogue by authors, the third a systematic index, and the fourth a catalogue of maps. It was, perhaps, partly the labor involved in making this catalogue that caused his health to break down. The last volume had hardly come from the press, when Peirce died, 26 July 1831, aged 53. He had left in manuscript a great part of a History of Harvard University, from its foundation, in the year 1636, to the period of the American Revolution. This was edited by his friend John Pickering, and published in 1833 (Cambridge; Brown, Shattuck and Company. 8¬∞. pp. XX., 316, 160). Quincy, in his History of Harvard, describes the book as \\"of great merit and usefulness, possessing the traits of that soundness of judgment and accuracy of investigation so eminently his characteristics.\\" He also published an Oration delivered at Salem, 4th of July, 1812.

Bring the digital and physical worlds together using tactile controls. Similar to Haptic Technology, as both focus on touch interactions with technology, but whereas Haptic is simulated touch, Tactile is physical touch. Also similar to Augmented Reality, but rather than using a digital interface to interact with the physical world, it does the opposite - a physical interaction that triggers a digital reaction. The word 'tactile' means \\"related to the sense of touch\\" or, \\"that can be perceived by the touch; tangible\\".  Benefits  Touch is incredibly important to human communication and learning, but increasingly, most of the content we interact with is purely visual. Tactile Technology presents a way to use the advances we have made in technology and combine it with a much more primordial instinct - touch. Studies show that humans work and learn better in a multi-sensory environment. Something as simple as having toys (like the fidget spinner) in the workplace, or using physical props to teach children in schools, can have significant impacts on productivity and information retention. Connected to the Multisensory learning theory. As stated in one article, ‚ÄúMany teachers are turning to tactile learning and evolving technologies as a way to engage students across different learning styles and needs. As part of a multi-sensory learning approach, tactile technology can help students across a range of skill development areas and a broad range of subjects.‚Äù  Implementations = Buttons = At the simplest level, a physical trigger that can be used to create a technological reaction is nothing new: it can be as basic as a button, or switch. More modern versions of buttons include conductive paint and projectors - these are both tools that can be used to make a non-digital surface act like a touchscreen, turning anything from tables to sculptures into interactive displays. * Fujitsu Laboratories uses projectors to turn a physical piece of information into a digital file. Mark a field you want to copy or display from a piece of paper with your finger, and the projector will copy that area into a digital file. * L√º - projection games for school = Gaming = Games are an example of a field that transformed from entirely tactile to largely digital, and where the trend is now turning back to a more multi-sensory experience. With video games, players want the element of touch that controllers provides, while researchers suggest that incorporating an element of physical interaction to digital games for children may mitigate concerns about excessive screen-time. For example: * Microsoft developed a mat called Project Zanzibar that uses capacitive touch and NFC technology to track objects placed on it and to record movements. By playing with physical toys on the mat, children can make movies or play games with visual and sound effects on a Microsoft tablet. There are also educational activities; the child can trace a letter on a physical card placed on the mat and the digital screen will mimic their gesture to make sure it was correct. This is a way for children to play with physical toys while still benefiting from the vast information available on a digital device. * Similarly, Lego has a product called Lego Fusion that lets children build using physical toys and then scan their creation into an app - they can then interact with the world they created digitally and share it with friends. * Keyboard companies have experimented with creating inflatable buttons for phones, that have been designed for those who miss the tangible aspect of typing or playing games. Logitech also recently game out with a keyboard that includes a large button/ dial for increased tangible control. = Textiles = Technology is increasingly being incorporated into physical objects that we already use - and one of the most significant examples of this is in the Textile industry. Companies are creating curtains that control light or detect smoke, clothing that monitors temperature, or fabric that integrates lighting. This is a swiftly growing field of \\"smart\\" apparel and home goods. This is also an example of wearable technology. = Art installations and museums = In order to experience art or communicate information, art galleries and museums are increasingly incorporating technology, especially as it makes art and education more immersive and personalized. * The Tate created something called a Sensorium, an art display that included all 5 senses. * teamLab Borderless Digital Art Museum * The Rain Room in the Barbican Centre in London - people walking through the space control the experience through their motion, as they walk through a rainfall but don't get wet. \\"The unique installation is yet another example of how the role of digital technology is taking audience participation, response and interaction to the next level within the world of art. The audience‚Äôs response becomes a crucial part of the installation, as the rainfall responds to their reactions through motorised mirrors, and in this way the audience become the subject of the artwork\\". * Brands using digital art and interactive digital experiences to engage consumers. Perrier, for example, had an interactive art wall for attendees to draw on. * SXSW combining art, cutting edge technology, and multi-sensory interaction.

The Cayman Ridge and Bartlet Trough formed from longitudinal faults at the crest of the uplift. Deformation in the Cretaceous brought granite intrusions, particularly in what is now Nicaragua. Much of the terrain and coastline of the country is defined by volcanoes and volcanic deposits produced from the subduction of the Cocos Plate. On the surface, rocks in El Salvador primarily date to the Pliocene and early Pleistocene and are typically volcanic. Some of the oldest surface exposures are in the Metapan area, with pre-Mesozoic monzonite together with Cretaceous marine limestone, overlain by Paleogene volcanic and terrestrial sedimentary rocks. The 650 foot thick Paleogene sandstone and conglomerate are above an unconformity with 30 feet of gray andesite, 400 feet of limestone and additional sandstone, conglomerate and calcareous shale.

Massive pyroclastic and ignimbrite eruptions caused the caldera to collapse although most of the material it erupted has been basalt. Analysis of an eruption of the caldera in 1772 indicates perhaps the highest rate of lava effusion in Central America. Another active volcano is the San Cristobal Volcanic Complex in the northwest, which erupted in the 1500s and 1600s and again at a reduced level in 1971, with tholeiitic, calc-alkaline and andesite material. Natural resource geology Nicaragua has 94 metal deposits and 46 non-metallic deposits. It is the leading gold producer in Central America from deposits in Bonanza, La Libertad and Limon, in epithermal and mesothermal vein deposits, as well as skarn and placer deposits. Eight million ounces of gold have been extracted since 1930. Copper, zinc, silver, limestone, aggregate, clay and gypsum are also important resources. Between 1943 and 1977, seismic and drilling surveys were done on the Miskito Basin off the eastern shore in search of oil. The Momotombo geothermal field was discovered in 1970, 50 kilometers northeast of Managua adjacent to Momotombo Volcano. Thirty three wells were drilled by 1981 with more than 100 megawatts of energy potential.

He served as Minister of Economic Coordination and Planning of the Republic of the Congo from June to September 1960 and again from February 1961 to July 1962.  Biography  Alo√Øs Kabangi was born on 1 August 1922 in Lusambo, Belgian Congo. He received a Catholic education at the Ecole Moyenne Officielle de Lusambo, studying there for four years. He subsequently became a clerk in the colonial administration. In 1945 he served as a member of the Cercle d'Agr√©ment Prince L√©opold III de Lusambo. He was a member of the founding committee of the short-lived Union des Populations rurales et extra rurales du Congo. In 1959 he was made attache to the cabinet of the Governor of Kasai Province. In March 1960 the Mouvement pour l'Unit√© Basonge (MUB) was founded in Kabinda and he became its president. Worried about worsening tribal conflict in Luluabourg, he and other leaders of the MUB formed a cartel with Patrice Lumumba's Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) on the guarantee that the latter would support the creation of Province of Basonge. In the general elections of May 1960 Kabangi was elected to the Chamber of Deputies on a Cartel MUB/MNC-Lumumba ticket in the Kabinda constituency, winning with 12,480 preferential votes. He was appointed by Prime Minister Lumumba to serve as Minister of Economic Coordination and Planning in his government of the newly independent Republic of the Congo. The government was officially invested by Parliament on 24 June 1960. The handover in the Ministry of Economic Coordination and Planning under Kabangi's leadership was relatively smooth, and the department busied itself with organising the distribution of foreign food aid to the interior of the Congo. As Lumumba became increasingly radical, Kabangi, a more moderate politician, grew distant from him. In September Lumumba was dismissed and replaced with Joseph Il√©o. Il√©o retained Kabangi as Minister of Economic Coordination and Planning, but he refused to accept the position. Il√©o appointed him to the same post on 9 February 1961 in his second government. In July 1962 Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula appointed him Minister of the Civil Service. On 17 April 1963 Adoula appointed him Minister of Public Administration. After the creation of the Province of Lomani, Kabangi served as its de facto indirect ruler. He used his position in the central government to ensure that the territory received improved transportation infrastructure and was appropriated needed funds. Kabangi also instructed the special commissioners tasked with keeping order in the province to keep the civil service under the control of the provincial secretary, ensuring continuity and stability in the local administration. In 1964 Kabangi brought the MUB into the Comit√© D√©mocratique Africain, a national political coalition. He was later made a member of the political bureau of the Mouvement Populaire de la R√©volution (MPR). In December 1970 the bureau was reorganised and he was dismissed from his position. Kabangi was awarded a gold medal of civic merit in January 2012. He died on 27 April 2014 at the Ngaliema clinic in Kinshasa while awaiting a flight to South Africa for medical care. A funeral was held on 20 May.

LOHCs can therefore be used as storage media for hydrogen. In principle, every unsaturated compound (organic molecules with C-C double or triple bonds) can take up hydrogen during hydrogenation. The sequence of endothermal dehydrogenation followed by hydrogen purification is considered as the main drawback which limits the overall efficiency of the storage cycle.G. Sievi, D. Geburtig, T. Skeledzic, A. B√∂smann, P. Preuster, O. Brummel, ... & J. Libuda (2019). Towards an efficient liquid organic hydrogen carrier fuel cell concept. In: Energy & Environmental Science, 12(7), 2305-2314. An alternative, innovative and highly promising approach to convert LOHC-bound hydrogen into electricity is proposed recently. The new unloading sequence consists of an almost thermoneutral catalysed transfer hydrogenation step converting ketone (acetone) to secondary alcohol (2-propanol) by contacting hydrogen-rich carrier (H18-DBT), and the secondary alcohol is then directly consumed in a PEMFC (direct isopropanol fuel cell; DIPAFC).2-propanol fuel cells, HI ERN. It is a CO2 emission-free, external energy input-free, and safe sequence with no molecular hydrogen at any point during hydrogen releasing. The \\"direct LOHC fuel cell\\" based on the LOHC-DIPAFC coupling concept is a very attractive solution for the on-board generation of electric energy in mobile applications, and it's driving researchers to focus on the topic.New systems for hydrogen chemical storage without molecular hydrogen.

Hyundai Motor invests in the development for stationary and on-board LOHC-systems.Hyundai Motor invests in Hydrogenious LOHC Technologies, Bioenergy International, 2020-06-04. Principle of LOHC-based hydrogen storage To absorb hydrogen, the dehydrated form of LOHC (an unsaturated, mostly aromatic compound) reacts with the hydrogen in a hydrogenation reaction. The hydrogenation is an exothermic reaction and is carried out at elevated pressures (approx. 30-50 bar) and temperatures of approx. 150-200¬∞C in the presence of a catalyst. The corresponding saturated compound is thereby formed, which can be stored or transported under ambient conditions. If the hydrogen is needed again, the now hydrogenated, hydrogen-rich form of the LOHC is dehydrogenated, with the hydrogen being released again from the LOHC. This reaction is endothermic and takes place at elevated temperatures (250-320¬∞C) again in the presence of a catalyst. Before the hydrogen can be used, it may have to be cleaned of LOHC steam. To increase efficiency, the heat contained in the hot material flow exiting the release unit should be transferred to the cold material flow consisting of hydrogen-rich LOHC entering the release unit in order to keep the energy requirement for preheating it before the reaction low. In particular, the heat released by the hydrogenation reaction when the hydrogen is absorbed can in principle be used for heating purposes or as process heat.D. Teichmann, K. Stark, K. M√ºller, G. Z√∂ttl, P. Wasserscheid, W. Arlt: Energy storage in residential and commercial buildings via Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC).

The company is headquartered in the British Virgin Islands, operated from its corporate office in Florida and has its stocks traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and BDR on the B3.  Operations  The company's producing assets include the San Andres gold mine in Honduras and the Ernesto/Pau-a-Pique gold mine in Brazil. On July 16, 2018, the company announced the results of the NI 43-101 Feasibility Study for the restart of operations at its Aranzazu mine in Zacatecas, Mexico. The company is conducting an exploration program at its Sao Francisco gold mine in Brazil to determine if a re-start of the mine is feasible. In addition, the company has two additional gold exploration projects in Brazil, Almas and Matup√°, and one gold project in Colombia, Tolda Fria. In Brazil, the company owns the Minera√ßƒÅo Apoena subsidiaries, which operates the SƒÅo Francisco gold mine in Nova Lacerda, Mato Grosso.  History  Formerly, Canadian Baldwin Holdings Limited, the company changed its name to Aura Gold, with former-Yamana Gold CEO Victor Bradley as its new CEO, and listed shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2006 in order to pursue exploration of gold properties in Brazil. In 2016, the company re-located its corporate offices from Toronto to Miami, Florida and, re-incorporated under the BVI Business Companies Act with its headquarters in Road Town, British Virgin Islands. Minera√ßƒÅo Apoena, a subsidiary of Aura, closed the SƒÅo Vicente gold mine, located in Nova Lacerda, in July 2013. The closure is due to the natural depletion of the mine. The mine started commercial production in 2009 and in the first year of operations produced 49,584 ounces of gold from 2.16 million tons of ore with a 0.43 grams of gold per tonne content. In early 2014, Aura Minerals reported that its mines hit record production in 2013. 206,700 ounces of gold were produced, an increase of 20% from the 172,500 ounces produced in 2012. The Aranzazu mine, which produces copper in Mexico, had its activities suspended in January 2015. The company said ait would spend the first half reviewing the development plans, costs and expenses of the project In May 2015, Aura Minerals signed an agreement with Serra da Borda Minera√ßƒÅo e Metalurgia (SBMM), a subsidiary of Yamana Gold, to acquire the Ernesto / Pau-a-Pique gold mine, located near Pontes e Lacerda, through the issuance of shares, call options and payment of royalties on future production. The operation was approved by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) in July 2015. In March 2018 the company completed a merger with TSX-listed Rio Novo Gold Inc in an all-stock deal with former Rio Novo shareholders forming 22% of the new Aura Minerals.

In the late Cretaceous, an oceanic trench or backarc system formed in connection with a subduction zone, situated where the Isthmus of Panama is now located. Into the early Paleogene, deep sea, open ocean sediments and basalt lava accumulated in the backarc. Volcanic activity was intense in the Cretaceous, Paleocene and Eocene. The volcanic arc that built up during the period overthrust onto the southern margin of North America. During the Oligocene, the offshore Pacific Plate fragmented into the Cocos Plate and Nazca Plate, divided by the east- west Colon spreading ridge. The tectonics of Costa Rica are more complicated because the Cocos Plate subdivided into two blocks separated by the Costa Rica Fracture Zone (running northeast onto land), with the northern block being subducted. Submarine canyons have been used to infer the path of the Panama Fracture Zone running along the coast creating wrench faults. On the Osa Peninsula, the Nicoya Complex preserves oceanic crust with basaltic lava, dolerite, gabbro, limestone, chert and argillite, obducted onto land before the Oligocene and then rearranged by Miocene wrench faults. In the Neogene the low angle subduction of the Cocos Plate led to volcanism in the now extinct Cordillera de Aguacate chain in the center of the country. The Valle Central basin formed as volcanism shifted northeastward in the Quaternary. In the Pleistocene, calderas ejected huge quantities of silica-rich ash, filling the Valle Central basin, affecting the Tarcoles Gorge and generating the Orotina debris fan at the coast. Streams rearranged and flowed more toward the Pacific, downcutting existing channels. In the past two million years, Costa Rican volcanoes have erupted andesite, rhyolite and dacite with geochemical patterns that suggest the magma may have come from the melting of metamorphosed basalt. Marine geologists have found mound-like structure offshore due to subduction related fluid venting. A lack of chlorine suggests a freshwater origin.

Its main charge was the Lion of Saint Mark, symbolizing Mark the Evangelist, the patron saint of Venice. A distinguishing feature of the flag is its six fringes, which were added to represent the original six sestiere of Venice. The fringes also serve to prevent damage being caused to the central section of the flag by wind. During times of peace, the Lion of Saint Mark was depicted alongside an open Bible. However, when the Republic was at war the Bible was replaced with the lion grasping an upright sword. The flag inspired the modern Flag of Veneto region in Italy.  History  It is unclear as to when the Republic officially adopted the flag. One chronicler, John the Deacon, described how in 998 Doge Pietro Orseolo II was presented with a \\"triumphale vexillum\\" (triumphal banner) before leading a naval expedition against the Narentines, pirates who moored off the eastern coast of the Adriatic and harassed Venetian seamen. However, this chronicle does not explicitly mention the use of the Lion of St. Mark within the flag or mention the colours used upon the banner. The first definitive recording of the usage of the Lion of Saint Mark on a red field dates back to the late thirteenth century. Genoese archivist Jacopo da Varazze explicitly makes reference to the Lion of St. Mark as the official symbol for Venice. He also mentions the how phrase \\"PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEUS\\" was found on the flag. The winged lion was chosen as a symbol of Venice due to its connotations with Saint Mark. Venetian tradition states how Saint Mark was travelling from Aquileia to Rome when an Angel appeared whilst he was in the lagoon of Venice and stated 'Pax tibi, Marce, evangelista meus. Hic requiescet corpus tuum' (Peace be with thee, O Mark, my evangelist. Here thy body will rest). The legend was used in 828 by Venetian merchants Rustico da Torcello and Bon da Malamocco to justify their journey to Alexandria to return the corpse of Saint Mark to Venice and inter it within the city. From that moment Saint Mark became the patron saint of Venice and thus began the association between the city and the winged lion. Vexillologist Whitney Smith suggests that the colours chosen, red and gold, were selected on the basis that they were the colours of the Byzantine Empire, the previous rulers of the region. For 337 years 12 Gonfaloniera, mercenaries from Perast (modern day Montenegro), were appointed by the Venetian senate to guard the flag of the Republic at all times on the pain of death. 8 were executed in 1571 after the Battle of Lepanto for failing to protect it. Following the fall of the Republic of Venice in May 1797 by France and Austria, the Lion of Saint Mark was suppressed throughout Venice. As a result, the traditional flag of the Republic of Venice was abolished and replaced with two equal horizontal bands of blue on top of yellow. Usage of the Lion of Saint Mark in the flag of Venice would not return until 1848, when it appeared in the canton of the flag of the Republic of San Marco.  Modern usage  The flag enjoys continued usage throughout the city of Venice. It can be found flying from the balconies of homes, hotels, and government offices. Some residents of the city also elect to fly the flag as an ensign from the stern of private boats, whilst some gondoliers choose to attach the flag to their gondola. On some occasions, the flag of the Republic of Venice flies atop a flagpole outside St. Mark's Basilica in Piazza San Marco. Usage of the flag has also been adopted as a symbol by some claiming to represent the Venetian regionalist movement. The flag of the Republic of Venice appears alongside the flag of Genoa, the Cross of Pisa, and the flag of the Republic of Amalfi on the ensign of the Italian navy.

In 1981, she became the first Hispanic woman to serve on the city council of San Antonio, where she served District One for ten years before running for mayor in 1991. In a campaign that garnered national attention, Berrioz√°bal led a field of 11 candidates before being narrowly defeated in a run-off. She became a local activist for the Chicano movement aligning with notable members of the Raza Unida Party such as Rosie Castro.  Early life and education  Berrioz√°bal's grandparents moved to Laredo, Texas from Mexico during the Mexican Revolution of 1910 and the family moved to San Antonio in 1942. When she was young, she attended Christ the King Private School and later graduating from Providence High School. After graduation from high school at age eighteen, she went to work and took college courses at night. It took her 20 years to earn a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Texas at San Antonio.  Career  Berrioz√°bal worked with The Salvation Army for seven years and was offered a job from John A. Daniels, chair of the Democratic Party in Bexar County. Her duties were, but not limited to, ‚Äú‚Ä¶typing contracts between Hemisphere ‚Äô68 and foreign governments, state of Texas, concessionaires, exhibitors, and the U.S. government, as well as translating documents from Spanish to English that arrived from Mexico and Argentina.‚Äù After an internal feud between conservative and liberal Democrats, John Daniels was ousted, but transferred to help Hubert Humphrey's campaign; Berrioz√°bal joined as the campaign manager within Bexar County. After Humphrey's loss, Berrioz√°bal was hired to be Judge Blair Reeves‚Äô ‚Äú‚Ä¶executive secretary at the county courthouse‚Ä¶‚Äù for seven years. She interned with Councilman Henry Cisneros and obtained a job with the San Antonio Census Bureau because of her past experiences. After assisting Henry Cisneros with his campaign to become mayor of San Antonio, Berrioz√°bal sought to obtain the vacant seat of District 1 councilperson. At first, she doubted herself due to not having enough money and political science colleagues warning about the cost of a campaign, but, when Al Peeler began to run for the position, Berrioz√°bal decided she was best fit to run due to ‚Äú‚Ä¶her thirty-nine years of living, serving, and knowing the people in her community‚Ä¶‚Äù After campaigning through the assistance of John Garcia, John Alvarado, Sylvia Rodriguez, and Luz Escamilla, Mar√≠a won the position for District 1 with 55% of the vote. She credits her values from her ‚Äú‚Ä¶childhood, the dreams of [her] family, and the history of a people to [her] work. The democratic principles [she] had studied in college became guidelines for [her] service, along with the values of Catholic social justice.‚Äù Her public service includes appointments as the U.S. representative to the Inter-American Commission for Women, an agency within the Organization of American States, and as a delegate to the United Nationals' Fourth World Conference in Beijing, China.  Later life  In 1993, Berrioz√°bal was honored with the Benetia Humanitarian award for her efforts within the community such as organizing the Sisters of Charity, served as the Visitation House's president of the board, and creating the Hispanas Unidas organization located at Our Lady of the Lake University. While Berrioz√°bal ran and lost for mayor of San Antonio after Henry Cisneros completed his term, she went on to become the U.S. Representative to the Inter-American Commission on Women of the Organization of American States agency and member of the U.S. Official Delegation to the Fourth World Conference on Women contributing to the world movement to improve on the conditions of women throughout other countries. Berrioz√°bal helped found the Santuario Sisterfarm to promote ‚Äú‚Ä¶a holistic understanding of justice, which embraces social justice principles, cultural diversity, and biodiversity.‚Äù She currently advocates for human rights, cultural diversity, and economic justice within the city of San Antonio, such as, protesting for nine hours, alongside fifteen students, outside the office of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for her support on the DREAM Act in 2010.  Personal life  While meeting Bishop Patricio Flores of Our Lady of Guadalupe church about the Mexican American Cultural Center, Manuel Berrioz√°bal arrived to seek a job at the University of Texas. Mar√≠a recalls after meeting him, ‚Äú‚Ä¶I knew the evening I met him that I was going to marry him, the very evening that I met him.‚Äù Maria and Manuel Berrioz√°bal married in 1975 and moved to New Orleans where Manuel was teaching at Tulane University.
