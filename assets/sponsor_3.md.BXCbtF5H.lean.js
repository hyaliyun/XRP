Astrue, 662 F.3d 700 (4th Cir. 2011), was a landmark Social Security Disability Insurance case argued in federal court, resolving a conflict within the circuit over the summary denial of requests for review when new evidence is submitted to the Appeals Council. After suffering severe injuries in an accidental fall, Maurice Eugene Meyer applied for Social Security Disability insurance benefits. An administrative law judge (ALJ) denied his claim, noting that Meyer failed to provide an opinion from his treating physician. When Meyer requested review of his claim by the Appeals Council, he submitted a letter from his treating physician detailing the injuries and recommending significant restrictions on Meyer's activity. The Appeals Council made this letter part of the record but summarily denied Meyer's request for review; thus, the ALJ's decision denying benefits became the final decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Meyer appealed, on the grounds that the Appeals Council did wrong in failing to articulate specific findings justifying its denial of his request for review. The court rejected this argument and ruled that the Appeals Council did not have to explain its reasoning when denying review of an ALJ decision, but because in this case the court could not determine if substantial evidence supported the denial of benefits, the court reversed and remanded.  Background  In December 2004, Meyer fell 25 feet out of a deer stand while hunting and suffered significant injuries. He fractured three lumbar vertebrae, which required reconstructive surgery. He also fractured his left wrist and injured his left shoulder, requiring additional surgery. At the time of his fall, Meyer was 51 years old and owned and operated a rural feed store. On December 13, 2004, Dr. Byron Bailey, an attending neurosurgeon at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, performed Meyer's back surgery. On December 26, Dr. Bailey discharged Meyer from the hospital, and referred him for physical and occupational therapy. Dr. Bailey observed Meyer in clinic for post-surgical follow-up through the spring of 2005, and reviewed Meyer's post-operative progress through at least April 2006. Following his surgery, Meyer underwent extensive physical therapy at the Rehabilitation Centers of Charleston, averaging between five and 10 visits per month until his discharge in June 2006. At that time, Dr. Bailey referred Meyer to the hospital's pain management clinic. Dr. Arthur R. Smith, an anesthesiologist, treated Meyer in clinic with various injections that provided Meyer \\"short-term relief\\" from his pain. In August 2007, however, Dr. Smith ceased the injections, acknowledging that they failed to provide Meyer with any \\"long-term benefit.\\" On July 13, 2005, Meyer filed a claim for disability insurance benefits with the Social Security Administration. Meyer‚Äôs Appeal Process After both his initial claim and request for reconsideration were denied, Meyer requested a hearing. The ALJ heard Meyer's claim and issued an unfavorable decision on June 5, 2008. In his opinion, the ALJ followed the federal regulations governing administrative review of Social Security Disability claims, proceeding through the customary five-step sequential analysis. Applying the first three steps, the ALJ determined that Meyer (1) had not engaged in \\"substantial gainful activity\\" since the date of his accident, (2) had the \\"severe impairments\\" of degenerative disc disease and a history of left wrist injury, but (3) did not have an impairment \\"that meets or medically equals\\" an impairment that the federal regulations define as disabling. As the regulations instruct, the ALJ evaluated Meyer's \\"residual functional capacity\\" before proceeding to step four. The ALJ concluded that Meyer could perform \\"the full range\\" of \\"light work,\\" which involves \\"lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds,\\" and \\"a good deal of walking or standing, or . . . sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls.\\" In reaching these conclusions, the ALJ found Meyer's assertion that \\"he suffered from constant, unrelenting\\" pain not entirely \\"credible\\" because it was \\"inconsistent with the medical evidence of record,\\" including Meyer's \\"reports to his physicians, and the treatment sought and received.\\" The ALJ relied on evidence that between August 2005 and June 2006, Meyer reported improvements in his condition, decreased pain, and less use of pain medication, and clinical observations that during this time Meyer was \\"in no apparent distress\\" and appeared \\"generally healthy.\\" The ALJ also cited a June 2006 one-page physical therapy discharge form noting that Meyer \\"was able to perform his activities of daily living independently; had no work/recreational restrictions; and could ambulate independently.\\" Further, the ALJ considered Meyer's testimony that he was able to drive and assist his wife in caring for their horses and dog, and evidence suggesting that Meyer continued, although to a lesser degree, to ride horseback and operate his tractor. The ALJ emphasized that \\"[g]iven the claimant‚Äôs allegations of totally disabling symptoms, one might expect to see some indication in the treatment records of restrictions placed on the claimant by a treating physician,\\" yet a \\"review of the records . . . reveals no [such] restrictions.\\" Meyer had asserted before the ALJ that although he sought opinions from Dr. Bailey and Dr. Smith, his treating physicians, it was their policy not to provide such opinion evidence in these types of proceedings. Meyer did submit the findings of Dr. Barry Weissglass, who, at Meyer's request, performed an independent occupational evaluation of Meyer in November 2007. Dr. Weissglass opined that Meyer was incapable of performing the functions of light work and recommended restrictions on his activities that were consistent with that finding, including that Meyer not lift more than 10 pounds and refrain from extended sitting or standing. However, the ALJ accorded Dr. Weissglass's opinion \\"only minimal evidentiary weight as it is inconsistent with the other evidence of record,\\" i.e., that detailed above. Proceeding to step four of the analysis, the ALJ concluded that Meyer was unable to perform his past relevant work of operating a rural feed store or being a marine machinist. At the fifth and final step, the ALJ considered Meyer's residual functional capacity for light work, his age of 51 years, and his \\"limited education,\\" and, based on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, which take administrative notice of the availability of job types in the national economy, concluded that Meyer was not disabled. After issuance of the ALJ decision on June 5, 2008, Meyer timely sought review by the Appeals Council. With his request for review, Meyer submitted new evidence not before the ALJ, including an opinion letter from his treating physician, Dr. Bailey, dated August 18, 2008. In the letter, Dr. Bailey described Meyer's back injury and surgery and explained that Meyer's \\"post-operative course has been complicated by chronic, debilitating back pain which was anticipated due to the magnitude of his injury.\\" Dr. Bailey opined that Meyer's \\"long term restrictions include no lifting greater than 10 pounds, avoid bending, stooping, squatting, and no sitting, standing or walking for more than 30 minutes without rest periods.\\" He explained that Meyer \\"will continue to require frequent follow-up and medical management\\" and \\"will [likely] require further surgical intervention in the future.\\" At the close of his letter, Dr. Bailey noted his \\"agreement with the majority of [Dr. Weissglass‚Äôs] findings.\\" On October 24, 2008, the Appeals Council denied Meyer's request for review. In doing so, the Appeals Council noted that it made Dr. Bailey's letter a part of the record. But in the Notice of Appeals Council Action, the Appeals Council \\"found that this information does not provide a basis for changing the [ALJ]‚Äôs decision\\" and so \\"the [ALJ]‚Äôs decision is the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security in [Meyer‚Äôs] case.\\" Meyer then filed this action. A magistrate judge recommended affirmance of the Commissioner's decision, concluding, inter alia, that Dr. Bailey's letter should be accorded only minimal weight because he was not one of Meyer's treating physicians. Meyer objected to the magistrate's recommendation but the district court entered a final order affirming the Commissioner's decision. Meyer timely noted this appeal. As the Appeals Council properly informed Meyer, because it denied review, the decision of the ALJ became \\"the final decision of the [Commissioner].\\" We uphold the factual findings underpinning the Commissioner's final decision \\"if they are supported by substantial evidence and were reached through application of the correct legal standard.\\" In making this determination, we \\"review the record as a whole\\" including any new evidence that the Appeals Council \\"specifically incorporated. In the end, Judge Dana L. Christensen of the United States District Court, D. Montana, Missoula Division agreed with Judge Lynch and upheld the magistrate's decision and denied Meyer's claim.

His son was the well-known illustrator and cartoonist, Rodolphe T√∂pffer, who is sometimes called the \\"father of the comic book\\".  Biography  He was the son of a German tailor from Schweinfurt, who had come to work in the Republic of Geneva for a few years, but decided to stay and become a citizen. After showing some talent for art, he was apprenticed to an engraver and later studied at the \\"Society of Arts'. Brief biography @ the Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz. View of Mont Blanc from Geneva He worked as an engraver in Lausanne for a short time, then went on an Alpine expedition with Horace-B√©n√©dict de Saussure; making sketches. In 1786, members of the Society, impressed with his work, recommended that he go to study in Paris and offered a scholarship. While there, he attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, where he studied with Nicolas Delaunay (1739-1792) and learned watercolor technique from Jean-Thomas Thibault. When he returned home in 1789, he found the city in turmoil from the effects of the French Revolution and was unable to find regular employment, so he did his best to make a living from teaching drawing and doing the occasional portrait. He held an exhibit of these in 1792, then accompanied the painter Pierre-Louis de la Rive (1753-1817) on his travels, becoming interested in landscapes and what would later be called plein-air painting. In the early years of the 19th Century, when the political situation had settled down a little, his works began to be successful, especially abroad. Some of his paintings were purchased by Empress Maria Feodorovna and the former Empress, Jos√©phine de Beauharnais. In 1812, he was awarded a gold medal at the Salon. He became a caricaturist and political cartoonist during the final years of the French Occupation and was sometimes called the \\"Hogarth of Geneva\\". For a time, some drawings from this period were mistakenly attributed to his son. He arranged for his daughter to marry a wealthy art collector and, after forty years of teaching and chairing the art society, died wealthy himself at the advanced age of 81, surviving his even more famous son by over a year.

This genus consists of several species that were previously described as Sphaerosyllis and as Sphaerosyllis erinaceus sub-species, differing by the compound chaetae. In 2005, San Mart√≠n argued these differences were sufficient to consider them as different species, trigerring a taxonomic redescription of the Syllidae, and describing this genus, Erinaceusyllis. Erinaceusyllis is similar to Sphaerosyllis. Species of Sphaerosyllis, however, always exhibit papillae on the pharyngeal opening, their pharyngeal tooth is conical and is always located on or very near to the anterior margin of the pharynx. They usually count with a short proventricle, itself provided with large muscle cell rows, large posterior acicula (which is distally bent at 90¬∞), blades of compound chaetae which are short and unidentate, and offspring developing ventrally, females without capillary notochaetae, only present on males. Sphaerosyllis horrockensis, Sphaerosyllis belizensis, and Sphaerosyllis centroamericana were transferred to Erinaceusyllis under these distinguishing characteristics. At the same time, Prosphaerosyllis is close to Erinaceusyllis, but its species' pharyngeal teeth are rhomboidal to oval and located near the middle of their pharynges; also their antennae are short, tentacular and their dorsal cirri have a bulbous cirrophore and retractile cirrostyle. Their papillae are larger in number and of different sizes. Description The species' body is minute, densely covered by papillae which are small, short, sometimes being distributed on cirri and parapodia. Its prostomium possesses three antennae, four eyes and two anterior eyespots. Its peristomium is large, covering the posterior margin of the prostomium, and in cases forming two dorsolateral wings covering the nuchal organs; it counts with only one pair of tentacular cirri. Dorsal cirri on its second chaetiger 2 are either absent or present, depending on the species, although they are usually absent. Its antennae, tentacular and dorsal cirri are spindle-shaped to pyriform, with somewhat bulbous bases. It carries a single pair of anal cirri similar to dorsal cirri although a bit longer. Its compound chaetae are heterogomph, with short or long blades, sometimes bidentate, unidentate, or a combination of both. Its pharyngeal tooth is small, conical to rhomboidal in shape, located near the pharyngeal anterior margin, sometimes near its middle. The pharynx usually shows no papillae around its opening, but they are present in larger species. Its proventricle is long and wide, barrel-shaped, with thin muscle cell rows, counting with around 15 to 22. Mature males exhibit natatory chaetae, while females brood eggs dorsally by means of capillary notochaetae. Distribution Erinaceusyllis is a marine genus, while some of its species are possibly cosmopolitan. Species Its type species is Erinaceusyllis erinaceus, formerly Sphaerosyllis erinaceus (Clapar√®de, 1863). It is thought to inhabit waters of Normandy, but is suspected to be cosmopolitan. In 2005, San Mart√≠n argued the original description was incomplete, stating the species has been reported worldwide, but that those records likely represent a complex of different species that need to be re-examined. Up to 2015, at least 12 species have been described, namely E. belizensis, E. bidentata, E centroamericana, E. cirripapillata, E. cryptica, E. erinaceus, E ettiennei, E. hartmannschroederae, E horrocksensis, E. kathrynae, E. opisthodentata, E. serratosetosa.

Directed by Jason Wise, a sequel, Somm: Into the Bottle, was released in 2015 and a third film, Somm 3, came out in October 2018.http://www.samuelgoldwynfilms.com/somm-3/ A TV series based on the movie launched on the Esquire Network in November 2015. In 2019, SOMM TV was launched by creator Jason Wise with original shows.https://www.foodandwine.com/wine/sommtv-streaming-wine-app Synopsis The movie begins in the San Francisco Bay Area briefly touching on the history of wine and the existence of the prestigious Master Sommelier exam. The film‚Äôs main characters, Ian Cauble, Dustin Wilson, DLynn Proctor, and Brian McClintic are introduced along with their various family members, wives, and girlfriends who all vouch for just how invested they really are in preparing for their Master Sommelier diploma. Every one of them has a different motive for wanting to pass, whether it is for their wife‚Äôs sake, an obsession with the idea of passing, or simply wanting to be seen as the most dapper guy in a restaurant. The candidates repeatedly assert that they have to know everything about wine, while the film jumps back and forth between wine makers in the United States, Italy, France, and Germany to illustrate that knowing everything about wine is virtually impossible. SOMM begins a countdown leading to the exam at the end of the film. With just three weeks left until the three-part exam (theory, service, and blind tasting), the audience begins to see the lifestyle this exam forces on its subjects. Common study techniques include tracing Internet maps for color-coding wine regions, making an absurd amount of flashcards, even Skyping with each other at 2:30AM for mock quizzes. They also begin practice tasting exams with current Master Sommeliers. With 10 days left, tensions are high and everyone is on edge as each tries to cram the extensive history, geography, and culture of wine into their brain before exam day that takes place in Dallas, Texas. The candidates' emotions are mixed with hope and fear as their mentors give them one last impossibly hard round of situational testing in service and tasting, including an exercise in just how fast one can get a bottle of wine cold. During a practice tasting with a Master Sommelier, Ian Cauble becomes convinced that someone has switched his wines. Brian speculates on the worst-case scenario of two of the three close friends becoming a Master Sommelier, leaving one behind who must continue training alone. When everyone finally arrives in Dallas for the test, Dustin Wilson decides to room with another candidate named Sabato Sagaria, leaving Brian McClintic to room with Ian. Ian Cauble comes prepared with a suitcase full of 16 pounds of wine for review. They all spend 6- to 10-hour days tasting, studying flashcards, and speculating on each other‚Äôs sanity. Ian Cauble stays up the entire night studying flash cards as his stress level builds. At the end of the movie Brian and Dustin end up passing and are welcomed into the organization, leaving DLynn and Ian on the outside and realizing Brian‚Äôs worst-case scenario. In a coda to the film, one year later Ian reattempts the exam and becomes the 197th Master Sommelier, and DLynn is still busy studying. Cast The four candidates appearing as themselves are Ian Cauble, Brian McClintic, Dustin Wilson and DLynn Proctor. In addition to friends and family members, several notable sommeliers are interviewed, including Fred Dame, Peter Neptune, Michael Jordan and Geoff Kruth.  Critical response  The film received mostly positive reviews. Esquire Magazine's Cal Fussman praised the film as \\"...a great film..\\" \\"..with a tense arc that pushes you to the edge of your seat...\\". Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 79% based on reviews from 24 critics, with an average rating of 6.7/10. Variety called the film \\"A stimulating intro course on wine appreciation\\" and praised its \\"accessible subjects and sparkling execution\\". The LA Times' critic Kenneth Turan called the film \\"glib but ultimately engaging.\\" The NY Post praised the film for doing \\"..a fairly impressive job of making wine tasting somewhat cinematic despite its being essentially unfilmable.\\" The NY Times' critic Rachel Saltz called the film \\"less about wine fetishism than about the fetishism of mastery\\" but felt the candidates were painted as \\"one dimensional jocks\\". She did note that the film was \\"an entree into a little-known world.\\" Awards The film was named best documentary feature at the 2013 San Luis Obispo Film Festival. Sequels In January 2015, distributor Samuel Goldwyn Films announced they had acquired exclusive rights to a sequel entitled Somm: Into the Bottle, with a theatrical release planned for later in the year.

It is considered a spiritual successor to 2011's Grand Knights History. Gameplay Players engage in turn-based battles where they command groups of mercenaries (referred to as squads) who are able to attack using weapons and magic attacks (depending on the specific combat class each unit belongs to) as well as support, defense, and healing moves. Battles involve arranging the positions of units into formations and executing action techniques.Dengeki PlayStation volume 593 (July 2015 issue), page 8-9. Each unit, which includes humans and demons, has a unique set of moves to employ in combat; for example, Medics can use medicine to heal allied units, set traps, or attack enemies, while Challengers can sacrifice themselves to inflict damage over a large area. Status conditions such as confusion, blindness, or poisoning, which affect the movement and strength of units, can help tip the odds in favor of either side. Obstacles and traps can be placed onto the field itself to hinder formations, as well as flags that change how units can be directed and commanded. When not battling, squads are represented as chess pieces, with a limited number of turns allowed per mission. If they run into an enemy piece, a battle is triggered. Alternatively, if they encounter an allied piece, they can be healed, usually for a fee. If squads encounter a roadblock like a tornado or a fierce storm, they can choose to force their way through it (and lose health), go through it slowly (and lose some turns), remove it with an item, or find another way around. During certain quests, enemy forces will deploy armaments such as cannons or catapults, which will periodically launch attacks in the middle of battles that occur within their aiming radius. These armaments can be destroyed if the squads manage to defeat the enemies guarding them. In addition to the standard campaign mode, there are also quests assigned by different nations with specific objectives, or the player can choose a region for their units to freely move around in. Within these areas, the squads can collect resources, battle enemies, open chests to obtain rare items, take part in fights for money or prizes, and defeat \\"bounty\\" squads for rewards. If there's a contract between the squad and a nation, additional quests can be unlocked as well. If these quests are completed successfully, extra money and rewards will be distributed; alternatively, if there is a high rate of failure, then the contract may not be renewed. Outside of quests, players will have the opportunity to travel to the capitals of the four nations, where they can purchase items, form contracts, obtain new equipment from blacksmiths, and review their war records. The Guild, which serves as a home base for all units, also offers its own merchant shop with unique items and training camps where units can learn new skills for the field, and can provide information on rival squads working for other nations. At launch, the game supported single player and online multiplayer modes, where players could fight against other players belonging to other nations, and expand the territory of their nation via invasions.Dengeki PlayStation volume 593 (July 2015 issue), page 6-7. There was online cross-play support for PS4 and Vita players. However, as of October 1, 2019, the online servers have been shut down by NIS America. Setting Grand Kingdom is set on the fictional continent of Resonail, where four nations are vying for dominance: Landerth, a cosmopolitan society built on commerce and manufacturing, Valkyr, a kingdom with a strong culture of warfare, Fiel, an isolated nation that acts as a refuge for those fleeing conflict, and Magion, which prides itself on its mastery of magic and magic- based technology. One hundred years after the fall of the Uldein Empire that once unified Resonail, mercenaries fight in battles throughout what remains of the region, all seeking to expand the territory of the four nations. As a rookie mercenary leader, the protagonist becomes involved in an incident which affects the whole continent, involving a legendary mercenary leader, the remnants of the Uldein imperial family, and the true history of the empire's collapse. Development Development of this game was first publicly revealed within a June 2015 weekly issue of Famitsu. The game was directed by Tomohiko Deguchi, a former employee of Vanillaware who had previously worked as a system planner for 2009's Muramasa: The Demon Blade and the director of 2011's Grand Knights History, for which Grand Kingdom is considered a spiritual successor. Chizu Hashii is responsible for character designs, while the audio is composed by Basiscape. Reception Four Famitsu reviewers scored Grand Kingdom 8, 7, 8 and 8 out of 10, for a total score of 31/40.

The policy is characterized by two numbers and , S geq s, such that when the inventory level falls below level , an order is issued for a quantity that brings the inventory up to level , and nothing is ordered otherwise. Gallego and Sethi Gallego, G. and Sethi, S. P. (2005). K-convexity in ‚Ñún. _Journal of Optimization Theory & Applications,_ 127(1):71-88. have generalized the concept of K-convexity to higher dimensional Euclidean spaces.  Definition  Two equivalent definitions are as follows:  Definition 1 (The original definition)  A function g: mathbb{R}rightarrowmathbb{R} is K-convex if :g(u)+zleft[frac{g(u)-g(u-b)}{b}right] leq g(u+z) + K for any u, zgeq 0, and b>0.  Definition 2 (Definition with geometric interpretation)  A function g: mathbb{R}rightarrowmathbb{R} is K-convex if :g(lambda x+bar{lambda} y) leq lambda g(x) + bar{lambda} [g(y)+K] for all xleq y, lambda in [0,1], where bar{lambda}=1-lambda. This definition admits a simple geometric interpretation related to the concept of visibility. Let a geq 0. A point (x,f(x)) is said to be visible from (y,f(y)+a) if all intermediate points (lambda x+bar{lambda} y, f(lambda x+bar{lambda} y)), 0leq lambda leq 1 lie below the line segment joining these two points. Then the geometric characterization of K-convexity can be obtain as: :A function g is K-convex if and only if (x,g(x)) is visible from (y,g(y)+K) for all ygeq x.  Proof of Equivalence  It is sufficient to prove that the above definitions can be transformed to each other. This can be seen by using the transformation : lambda = z/(b+z),quad x=u-b,quad y=u+z.

Property 2  If g_1 is K-convex and g_2 is L-convex, then for alpha geq 0, beta geq 0,; g=alpha g_1 +beta g_2 is (alpha K+beta L)-convex.  Property 3  If g is K-convex and xi is a random variable such that Eg(x-xi)<infty for all x, then Eg(x-xi) is also K-convex.

Vakhtang was in opposition to his elder brother, King Bagrat III of Imereti and eventually had to flee to the Kingdom of Kartli, followed by many Imeretian noblemen. In 1512, Bagrat with his army crossed into Kartli, attacked Vakhtang at his base in Mokhisi and defeated him. Through the mediation of King David X of Kartli, the brothers reconciled and Vakhtang returned to Imereti. In the late 1540s, Vakhtang was placed at the head of an Imeretian detachment of 500 men sent by Bagrat in response to the cry for help from Rostom Gurieli, Prince of Guria, who was pressured by the Ottoman advance into his possessions around Batumi. Since Gurieli also appealed for help to Levan I Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, Vakhtang received a clandestine instruction from his brother not to allow any accord between Gurieli and Dadiani, who were defiant vassals of the king of Imereti. In the meantime, Gurieli succeeded in rolling back the Ottoman forces beyond the Chorokhi before the reinforcements arrived, but he failed to cross the swollen river, thus losing Gonio and Adjara to the enemy. His hopes that the Mingrelians and Imeretians would eventually come to aid were dashed. Through Vakhtang's intrigues, Dadiani, camping at the mouth of the Rioni at Poti, went back to Mingrelia; Vakhtang too, seeing an untenable situation of Gurieli, returned to Imereti.

He announced his resignation on 21 October 2019 and left office on 27 November 2019.  Early life and career Mashaba was brought up in near-poverty in GaRamotse in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria by his sisters while his absent domestic-worker mother worked to provide for the family. His older brother dropped out of school at 15, going from one unsubstantial job to another. Mashaba realised that acquiring an education would be crucial for him to break out of the cycle of poverty. He graduated from high school but did not complete his tertiary education. From a young age, he was a strategic thinker - he bought a car without having a license and drove out of the dealership without ever having learned to drive. He drove himself from one selling job to another, in the process confirming for himself that he was a natural salesman with an unswerving instinct for business. He started selling \\"SuperKurl\\" African hair-care products and became their number-one earner. He soon realised that these products excited him and that he wasn't content to be just an employee.(Book titled \\"South Africa's Greatest Entrepreneurs\\", compiled by Moky Makura, article written by Isabella Morris) His company, Black Like Me, was launched on Valentine's Day in 1985 with a loan from his friend, businessman Walter Dube. Mashaba is also a music lover. After five years of secret lessons, he revealed himself as a pianist.  Politics  From 2012 until May 2014, Mashaba served as chairman of the Free Market Foundation (FMF). He stepped down from his position when he joined the Democratic Alliance as an \\"ordinary card-carrying member\\", citing the need for the Foundation to remain politically impartial. Mashaba announced in December 2015 that he would accept a nomination to stand as a Democratic Alliance mayoral candidate for the City of Johannesburg in the 2016 local government elections. The other possible DA candidate was Rabelani Dagada.  Mayor of Johannesburg  In the municipal election on 3 August 2016, the ruling party, The African National Congress, lost their majority in Johannesburg, taking only 44.12% of the vote with the Democratic alliance taking 38.33%.http://www.elections.org.za/content/LGEPublicReports/402/Detailed%20Results/GP/JHB.pdf The Democratic Alliance entered into conversations with the Economic Freedom Fighters to form a coalition. Whilst the EFF declined the offer, they agreed that they would vote for Mashaba as the Mayor of Johannesburg, despite misgivings. On 22 August 2016, Mashaba was sworn in as a Johannesburg City Councillor. Later that day, he was sworn in as the Mayor of Johannesburg, the first non-ANC Johannesburg mayor since 1994. On 21 October 2019, he announced his resignation as mayor because of differences with DA party leadership. His resignation took effect on 27 November 2019.  Labour  Mashaba has characterised the ANC's post-Apartheid labour laws as \\"draconian\\". He led a Constitutional Court challenge by the FMF, arguing that Section 32 of the Labour Relations Act is unconstitutional. The FMF argued that the bargaining council process reduces competition, as smaller businesses may not be able to afford the higher wages agreed on between larger businesses and unions, contributing further to South Africa's unemployment rate. Post-mayoral career Mashaba formed The People's Dialogue, a medium to interact with ordinary South Africans and discuss social and civil issues, which launched on 6 December 2019, and closed on 29 February 2020. He has also said that he is willing to run for Mayor of Johannesburg under a different party banner. He added that he would be forming a political party in early 2020. On 29 August 2020, Mashaba launched the new political party, ActionSA.  Public profile   Allegations of xenophobia  Mashaba has made numerous public comments and actions that have been considered xenophobic and have been linked to incidence of xenophobic attacks and anti-migrant sentiment. He has said South Africa has \\"nothing to apologise for\\" in reference to xenophobic violence occurring during his tenure as Johannesburg mayor While its said Mashaba leaves a xenophobic legacy he has attended a sensitivity program on diversity by the Human Rights Commission.

Early life Tanner in the 1914 Brigham Young University yearbook Vasco Myron Tanner was born to John Myron and Lois Ann Stevens Tanner on October 29, 1892, in Payson, Utah. He spent his childhood in farms in Indianola and Fairview, Utah. His younger brother Wilmer Webster Tanner became a noted herpetologist. In 1909 at age 17 he moved to Provo, living with extended family while he attended Brigham Young High School for two years. He finished high school at the newly established North Sanpete High School. College and teaching In 1912 he attended college at Brigham Young University for three years, where he majored in biology. He received a scholarship which paid for two years of his tuition there. He graduated from Brigham Young University in 1915.Brigham Young University Commencement Exercise, 1915. Tanner finished coursework for his master's degree in Geology from the University of Utah in 1916. While he was writing his thesis on the deltas of Lake Bonneville, he taught at Dixie Junior College in St. George, Utah. Tanner helped Ernest M.

Also in 1920, Tanner went back to Dixie college to teach after supervising agricultural projects in Moroni for two years and became a state crop pest inspector for Washington county, Kane county, and Iron county. He began work on his PhD at Stanford in the summers of 1921 and 1923, where David Starr Jordan, then president of Stanford, befriended him and convinced him to study entomology.Oral history interview with Vasco M. Tanner, conducted by Millard L. Meanea on 12 August 1975 for the Joint Oral History Program of the Brigham Young University Alumni Association Emeritus Club. MSS 6743 He earned his PhD from Stanford in 1925 in zoology and entomology with G. F. Ferris as his dissertation adviser. Tanner's dissertation was on the morphology of the genitalia of female beetles. Later in 1925 he accepted an appointment to be a professor of zoology and entomology at Brigham Young University and chairman of the same department. Brigham Young University and civic work Tanner was the chair of the zoology and entomology department until 1958. He helped construct a lakeside biological laboratory where the Provo river empties into Utah lake, where he and students studied fish and birds. He founded, published and edited The Great Basin Naturalist starting in 1939, through which he published many of his own papers. Tanner studied beetles, especially darkling beetles and weevils, as well as herpetology and natural history of the Great Basin. By 1970 he had described around 65 species and one genus of beetles, and was commemorated in the scientific names of five species. He directed the research of 48 graduate students, and published nearly 150 articles. The university's insect collection doubled from 300,000 insects to over 650,000 between 1951 and 1971 when he helped collect specimens for the university. His students praised his dedication to encourage individual students and his passion for zoology. In 1972 he received the Karl G. Maeser award for teaching excellence. He was a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society and the Entomological Society of America. While Tanner stopped teaching at age 78 in 1970, he continued work as a curator of entomology until 1981. In 1932, the Tanners built a home in Provo at 70 E 800 N designed by Joe Nelson Tanner served for 35 years as chairman of the forestry and flood control committee in Provo's chamber of commerce. As part of his work to reduce flood risk, he oversaw terracing, development of recreational facilities, and cessation of mountain grazing and planting of grasses in the Provo canyon and surrounding areas. He was also chairman of the city utilities board for 20 years. There is an electrical substation named after him at the mouth of the Provo canyon, which reduced blackouts in Provo. Tanner was a member of the Utah state parks and recreation commission for four years, and was president of the Sons of the Utah Pioneers for three years. He was secretary and editor for the Utah Academy of Arts and Sciences for 12 years. He was a Democratic state congressman candidate in 1964. Family life and legacy Tanner met his wife Annie Atkin at Dixie college the first year he taught there. They were married on June 7, 1917. They had five children together. The Tanners also helped raise Ahmed Shayesteh from age ten, at the request of Ahmed's father, United States Minister from Iran, and BYU President Franklin S. Harris. On family camping trips, Vasco still prioritized specimen collection, enlisting his children to aid his search for new desert species. Annie wrote that \\"in the mind of a zoologist, the female of the species is only important for the part she plays in reproducing the species. This part I have played.\\" When Annie Atkin Tanner died in 1972, Vasco gave $2000 to create the Annie Atkin Tanner literary award at Dixie college.

The three-storey building was constructed as a private residence, Church Hill House, in 1820, when Handsworth Wood was part of Staffordshire. It has a stucco finish, a slate roof and porch with doric columns. Around the 1880s, it was occupied by the Muntz family, George Frederic Muntz' second son William Henry Muntz having married Alice Parker, the second daughter of its occupant, George Parker, in 1846. It subsequently became a hotel, known as the Hill House Hotel and then the Endwood Hotel, before being purchased in 1937 by the brewers Butlers of Wolverhampton, who used it as a pub. That company, and thus the Endwood, was acquired by Mitchells & Butlers in 1960. It was given listed building status in July 1982. A 2001 proposal to convert the building into flats was dismissed. In June 2015, a planning application was submitted to Birmingham City Council, for use of the building as an education centre. The building sits immediately opposite the site of the defunct Handsworth Wood railway station (1896‚Äì1941), and the railway line passes beneath the house in a short tunnel.

He is wanted for killing approximately 184 people, about half of whom were police officers, including senior police and forest officials. He was also wanted for poaching about 200 elephants and smuggling ivory worth US$2,600,000 and about 10,000 tonnes of sandalwood worth approximately US$22,000,000. In 1991, Veerappan and his chief Intel Gandhi (Sadh Orhan), behead IFS Officer P. Srinivas (Gadda Viji). Years later, Veerappan avenges the death of his close associate Gandhi by misleading Special Task Force (STF) personnel in their covert operation, through Gandhi's unnamed notorious informer (Aziz Naser). The covert mission led by T. Harikrishna S.P. (Rockline Venkatesh), and his informer S.I. Shakeel Ahmed (Rajesh Nataranga) to kill Veerappan fails miserably. Veerappan, and his army brutally assassinate all the STF officers in the operation, and snatch their arms. The Tamil Nadu STF chief K. Vijay Kumar I.P.S. (K. S. Sridhar) appoints his associate, an undercover I.P.S. spy in the Karnataka region, a master- strategist (Shiva Rajkumar), who puts in place the Operation Cocoon through a network of tribals, and informers, such as Deputy spy (Sanchari Vijay), a woman STF spy and landlord, Shriya (Parul Yadav), who befriends and rents out house to Muthulakshmi-the wife of Veerappan (Yagna Shetty). On the other hand, a team of loyal undercover cops led by Rambo Krishna (K Gopalakrishnan), leave Palar base of STF, near M. M. Hills, from Kollegal of Karnataka along with a team of 41 members which includes police from two states, forest officials, forest watchers and informers. The team travels in two vehicles, of which one is a bus carrying most of the team members, and a jeep carrying K.Goplakrishnan, the IPS officer. Veerappan gang plants landmines on the road in more than 14 places to halt their approach, and during the Palar blast, K.Gopalakrishnan, standing on the foot board of the jeep is thrown out, and suffer severe injuries, leaving the police to retaliate and ultimately prevent the snatching of arms. After few failed attempts, including the one led by another undercover cop (Gundragovi Satya), disguised as a subordinate to Muslim underworld Don-Kadaani (Ramesh Pandit), to negotiate arms deal with Veerappan's gang, the STF team led by master-strategist, and an ex-spy turned timberyard owner-Kumar (K. S. Iyengar), finally succeed on 18 October 2004. On that day, Veerappan is escorted out of the forest by Kumar who earlier infiltrates Veerappan's gang in disguise to negotiate another arms deal with Velupillai Prabhakaran. Subsequently, veerappan and his men board an ambulance stationed at Papparapatti village in Dharmapuri district, Veerappan and his men are first warned and then asked to surrender, which was denied, and the men start firing at the STF personnel. The STF retaliate by firing grenades and gun fire, subsequently Veerappan and his men are killed on the spot.  Cast  * Shiva Rajkumar as an unnamed STF master-strategist, touted to be based on N. K.

Lyrics  Somewhere far away, Somewhere in the fray, Many boys are over the sea, Fighting for you, fighting for me. They're all proud to carry a gun. Their work will soon be done. CHORUS \\"Homeward Bound\\" Someday they'll hear that welcome sound, For while the shot and the shell are flying, For the ones at home they're sighing: And tho' the skies seem grey, There's bound to be a brighter day, For when the dove of peace flies over the land, They all will hear the general give the command, \\"We are \\"Homeward Bound'.\\" That's a wonderful, wonderful sound. When the moon looks down On the battleground, By the campfires' flickering gleams, They think of home in all their dreams. Of the future naught can they learn. Let's pray for their return. REPEAT CHORUS AD LIB: RECITATION: \\"Homeward Bound\\" There's so much meaning in the sound. To all those faithful one, those noble sons, upon the battleground, For tho' their minds are on their duty And the fight that must be won, There are times they can't help but wishing, That their mighty tasks were done. Even tho' you're not a soldier, tho' you're not across the sea, There is something in these words that takes you back to mother's knee So let's keep the home fires burning, with the hope in every heart, That they'll soon will be returning to us, nevermore to part.

Its name derives from its type locality (Levantine Basin), levantina being the feminine form of a neo-Latin adjective meaning \\"pertaining to the region where the sun raises\\"; the adjective is feminine to agree with the feminine genus name, Syllis being a river nymph in Greek mythology. While Faulwetter et al. researched the soft bottom benthos of Haifa Bay, several individuals of the Sphaerosyllis exhibited features which did not correspond to any known Sphaerosyllis species. These characteristics were: falcigers with prominent serration and with a subdistal spine present in all chaetigers; a subdistal spine on the blades of some of its falcigers (also found in S. hystrix and S. boeroi). The authors then re-examined material of Sphaerosyllis hystrix from previous finds, which revealed some individuals possessed a subdistal spine on the blades of anterior falcigers and also in posterior chaetigers. To clarify the relationship between the new specimens and the 2 described species possessing falcigers with a subdistal spine, the scientists conducted a morphometric analysis. Description The animal counts with 25 chaetigers over a length of with palps but without anal cirri. Its width at its sixth chaetiger is 250¬µm without parapodia. It has a small and thin body, widest at its proventricle. It shows irregular dorsal papillation on its anterior chaetigers, while its ventrum does not show papillation. Its prostomium is wider than long, with 4 coalescent lensed eyes arranged trapezoidally; anterior eyespots are absent. It counts with pyriform antennae with bulbous bases and elongated tips, its median antenna measuring 40 ¬µm long, while lateral ones measure 33 ¬µm, which is longer than its prostomium and palps together. Its median antenna is inserted between its anterior pair of eyes, the lateral ones attached on the anterior margin of its prostomium. The animal's palps are ventrally-directed, fused along their length and with a dorsal notch and few small papillae. Its peristomium shows a dorsal fold partly covering the prostomium. It counts with one pair of tentacular cirri, which are shaped like the antennae but are shorter. Its second chaetiger lacks dorsal cirri but has a large papilla instead. The dorsal cirri are shaped similarly to the tentacular cirri. Its ventral cirri are conical and half as long as its parapodial lobe. Its anterior parapodia possess 4 to 5 (in rare cases 6) falcigers per fascicle; its blades are thin and unidentate, with their lengths showing dorso-ventral gradation, dorsal ones measuring a maximum of 14 ¬µm, while ventral ones 10 ¬µm. Posterior dorsal blades have a similar length 13 ¬µm. S. levantina's ventral simple chaeta on the posterior chaetigers are sigmoid and smooth. Anteriorly, the parapodium exhibit two aciculae, one distally bent at a right angle, with an acuminate tip, the other being straight and blunt; posterior parapodium shows only one acicula as previously described. Its pharynx occupies three chaetigers, with a width spanning more than ¬æ of the width of the proventricle. Its pharyngeal tooth is located on its anterior margin, surrounded by a crown of soft papillae. The proventricle possesses 15 to 17 muscle cell rows. The pygidium is papillated, with two anal cirri twice as long as the dorsal cirri. Sphaerosyllis levantina and Sphaerosyllis minima are alike, by having serrated blades of falcigers throughout the body. S. minima, however has a stronger dorso-ventral gradation of the falcigers' blades. Sphaerosyllis capensis, Sphaerosyllis taylori, and Sphaerosyllis sandrae also show similarities with S. levantina, especially with regards to the shape and serration of the falcigers' blades, but S. capensis has all antennae positioned in line, and S. taylori shows no dorso-ventral gradation of the falciger blade length, while S. sandrae has smooth falcigerous blades posteriorly and parapodial glands with hyaline material. All of these species differ from Sphaerosyllis levantina by lacking a subdistal spine on the falcigers' blades. Three species of Sphaerosyllis are known to possess this spine: S. hystrix, Sphaerosyllis parabulbosa and S. boeroi. S. parabulbosa differs from S. levantina by carrying minuscule dorsal cirri and antennae, by the exhibiting a subdistal spine only the posterior falcigers' blades and by the smooth blades of its posterior falcigers. S. boeroi, in turn, differs from S. levantina in having significantly longer falciger blades, which simultaneously show more pronounced dorso-ventral gradation. S. hystrix can be distinguished from S. levantina by showing smooth or finely serrated posterior falcigers, even when the spine is present. Concomitantly, blades of the dorsalmost falcigers show anteroposterior gradation in length in hystrix, whereas in levantina they are of similar length throughout its body. S. hystrix also possesses a considerably narrower pharynx. Distribution S. levantina was found in fine to medium sands in Haifa Bay, at a depth of . Its distribution includes the Israeli coast (Levantine Basin).

He created a new technique for reducing metacarpophalangeal dislocation and was the first surgeon to open an abscess at the hip joint. Crosby was also the first surgeon in the United States to be sued for medical malpractice.  Early life and education  Crosby was born February 8, 1800 at Sandwich, New Hampshire, United States. His parents were Dr. Asa Crosby and Betsey (Hoit) Crosby. Just before his birth, there was concern among his parents. Asa wanted a boy and Betsey wanted a girl. It turned out the new baby was a boy and Asa, the elated father, exclaimed \\"Dixi\\" in an overjoyed voice (Latin Dixi, \\"I told you so\\"). Dixi became the child's name. He received the typical education of the time when he grew up in the village where the family lived. It is not known if he was a graduate of any school. He did go into his own ventures to make money when youthful, but failed due to lack of experience in business. He then pursued his father's trade as a surgeon.  Medical career  Crosby was 20 when he took up the study of medicine with his father. He began practicing surgery within a year from when he seriously took up his medical training. One example of a successful surgery in his first year of practice was when he performed an amputation of a leg to save a patient. His father and other surgeons had already declared that the patient could not survive such an operation ‚Äì but Crosby saved his life. Crosby studied at Dartmouth Medical School and eventually received his degree from that college in 1824. He practiced his medical profession for fourteen years in various places within the state of New Hampshire and then moved to Hanover, New Hampshire. He was promoted in 1838 to the chair of surgery at the Dartmouth Medical School, which position he held until 1841. To this position was added obstetrics and other diseases of women and children. He lectured in these fields for 27 years. Crosby led the successful drive to found a society supporting total abstinence from alcohol at Dartmouth in 1844. Crosby created a new technique of reducing metacarpophalangeal dislocation. He was the first surgeon to open an abscess at the hip joint. Crosby was the first surgeon in the United States to be sued for medical malpractice.  Later life and death  Crosby served in the provost marshal's office by day during the Civil War, and attended to his medical practice at night. The honorary doctor's degree of LL.D. was given to him by Dartmouth College in 1867. He ultimately turned over his medical lectures in 1868 to his assistant. Crosby retired in 1870 and was appointed emeritus professor of surgery. He lectured then from time to time whenever he desired. Crosby died at Hanover, New Hampshire, September 26, 1873.  Personal  Crosby was cumbersome and awkward in his walk, although a well- dressed man. He had a large head with his hair in back reaching his coat collar. Crosby had a curly shaggy reddish beard that was never combed. He kept his upper lip clean-shaven so that no hair would obstruct his lecture speaking in the medical school. He had a positive attitude that was especially apparent when he talked as he walked. Crosby married Mary Jane Moody of Gilmanton, New Hampshire, in 1827. They had two sons. The first son, Albert H. Crosby (1828‚Äì1886) of Concord, New Hampshire, became a medical doctor even though he initially trained as a lawyer. The other son, Alpheus Benning Crosby (1832‚Äì1877), became a professor of surgery at Dartmouth College.

Following heavy rains, Gujarat was affected by floods. The flood is also known as the June 2015 Gujarat flood or 2015 Amreli flood. Flooding in the Amreli district was reported to be the worst in 90 years; 600 of the district's 838 villages were affected, 400 of which were rendered inaccessible by land. At least 80 people died in the region, with Saurashtra suffering the greatest losses. The wild life of Gir Forest National Park and the adjoining area was also affected. Ten Asiatic lions, an endangered species with only 523 living individuals documented in May 2015, died during the floods while more than a dozen remain missing. The Gujarat government estimated damage at (); however, Congress MLA Paresh Dhanani claimed damage to be as high as (). Meteorological history The monsoon in Gujarat typically starts in mid-June every year. Following a series of monsoonal disturbances, a fresh wave of thunderstorms organized into an area of low pressure on 21 June in the Arabian Sea, off the coast of Gujarat. Deep convection persisted to the west of the system while the circulation continued to develop over the next 24 hours, and the IMD started tracking it as a depression, with the identifier ARB 02. ARB 02 continued to develop and by the night of 22 June, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system, while it was west-northwest of Mumbai. Impact Flood affected areas of Amreli district on 24 June 2015 There were heavy rains on 23 and 24 June 2015 across Gujarat.Saurashtra and south Gujarat received 65.99% and 37.82% respectively of their average monsoon season rainfall in June. Central- East Gujarat received 19.92%, north Gujarat 7.45% and Kutch 7.30% of their average monsoon season rainfall. Overall Gujarat received 33.95% of its average monsoon season rainfall. These large amounts of rain falling in a short period of time resulted in flooding in Saurashtra region. Torrential rains battered Gujarat, with peak accumulations of in Bagasara, in Dhari, and in Variyav. Severe flooding ensued across the region, isolating many villages in the Saurashtra region. In Saurashtra, Amreli district was badly affected, facing its worst flood in ninety years. Nearly 600 of the 838 villages in the district were flooded. More than 400 villages were inaccessible as road and rail connections were washed away due to flash floods and they had no electricity. Shetrunji river and its tributaries were flooded. A railway bridge near Gavadka collapsed and a railway line was washed away near Borala village near Savarkundla. Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (PGVCL) declared 705 electricity poles damaged. In Rajkot district, more than 1700 houses sustained damage. Jetpur town was flooded as the floodgates of Bhadar dam were opened. There was severe damage to crops and a large number of cattle died. The flood and heavy rain resulted in 81 deaths across Gujarat. The preliminary damage estimated by the government were at 1650 crore (US$260 million), but The Indian Express estimated the damage at 7000 crore (US$1.1 billion), much higher than the government's estimation. However, Congress MLA Paresh Dhanani claimed damage to be as high as (). The Gir Forest National Park and adjoining area housing Asiatic lions, an endangered species with only 523 living individuals documented in May 2015, was severely affected. The carcasses of 10 lions, 1670 Nilgai, 87 spotted deer, nine black bucks, six wild boars and some porcupines were also recovered. A total of 112,217 farmers suffered major or minor damages, while 134,007 hectares of land were eroded. Aftermath People being rescued by Indian Air Force helicopter The state government deployed the Indian Air Force (IAF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) for rescue and relief operation. On 25 June 2015, IAF helicopters delivered more than 200,000 food packets to villages affected by the flood. Around 4,000 people were evacuated from seventeen villages downstream of Bhadar dam. More than 200 people were rescued from various places affected by the floods. The Chief Minister of Gujarat, Anandiben Patel declared Rs 400,000 as compensation to the kin of each of the deceased. The Government of Gujarat announced a 300 crore relief package which included 150 crore from the National Calamity Relief Fund. Another flood affected Gujarat a month after this storm.

More recent genealogy, currently established in Georgia and based on the identification of Khosro as a cousin of George II in a contemporary document, considers Khosro as a son, not a grandson, of Prince Vakhtang.

Career  In 1568, Khosro led a revolt of the Imeretian nobles against King George II. A major driving force behind the rebellion was Levan I Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, who made common cause with the Imeretian opposition. George was betrayed by one of his men and Khosro and Varaz Chiladze led the rebels in a \\"treacherous\\" attack on the king at Ianeti. George won, however, forcing the rebels into flight.

Personal life Nakayama was born to Japanese parents in Koreatown in Los Angeles. Her parents worked as fish distributors (now run by her older brother) and ended up divorcing when Nakayama was 12. She later attended culinary school in Pasadena, after which she worked at Mori Sushi. \\"Committed to exploring new techniques,\\" she then began a three-year working tour of Japan, where she immersed herself as much as possible \\"in the essentials of Japanese cuisine.\\" While there, she cooked at Shirakawa-Ya Ryokan under Chef Masa Sato, a Japanese country-style inn owned by her cousins that was renowned for its kaiseki cuisine. Her experiences with Japanese cuisine deeply influenced her, and upon returning to California, opened Azami Sushi Cafe (known for its all female staff) with the stressful help of her family. Ultimately, she opened her now famous n/naka restaurant in Los Angeles, where she works with her wife, Carole Iida, who is a partner and sous chef at n/naka. Nakayama and Iida reside in Arcadia, California. Restaurant & cooking style Nakayama serves a multi-course Japanese menu which features seasonal ingredients and multiple preparation styles that showcase the chosen ingredients. This way of cooking is known as kaiseki. N/naka is known for serving 13 course meals, in which all the dishes have a natural flow and progression to them, and uses highly seasonal ingredients, some of which come from Nakayama's own home garden which provides plenty of vegetables and herbs. Her \\"menu emphasizes seasonality, and the courses are structured to showcase ingredients using a sequence of preparations: A raw dish is followed by a grilled dish, then a braised or steamed dish, then a fried dish and so on, from light to heavy to light again. Designed to accompany tea ceremonies in monasteries, kaiseki began in 16th- century Japan as beautifully presented yet austere vegetarian fare. Over the centuries, the cuisine evolved to encompass a nearly opposite concept: food as luxury, a feast for a crowd. (There are actually two different ways of writing the word kaiseki in Japanese: One refers to the simple, monastic interpretation, while the other refers to a banquet.) Nakayama makes what she calls \\"modern kaiseki,\\" grounded in the Buddhist custom but open to interpretation.\\" Nakayama's style of kaiseki is expressive of her own belief that the chef should never lose track of the ingredient's integrity, and that guest's experience in her restaurant is of the utmost importance. In 2019, n/naka was one of six Los Angeles restaurants to receive two stars in the Michelin Guide. Also in 2019 n/naka was named to Food & Wine's 30 best restaurants in the world. Despite n/naka's critical acclaim, Chef Nakayama's cuisine was not always met with such positive reviews. Being a woman in the typically male-dominated world of high-end cuisine is usually difficult enough, but being a female chef in the predominantly male world of Japanese cooking gave her an additional set of obstacles, requiring her to constantly prove her abilities as a chef. While working at Azami, \\"a Japanese man once walked in, saw [Nakayama] behind the counter, did an about-face and left. [Nakayam said that:] \\"He thought, 'This can't be a real sushi restaurant--or a good sushi restaurant.' \\" Due to such sexist attitudes, Nakayama has since decided to work in closed kitchens, where patrons and diners cannot see her, and therefore, cannot take her gender into consideration when judging her cuisine, she says that \\"It's better that the guests just focus on the food versus who's making the food. With Japanese food, it's so easy to have an idea of what your chef should look like.\\" Television In 2015 Nakayama was featured on episode four of the first season of Netflix's Chef's Table series in which she discusses her career and the many obstacles she has overcome, as well as the many influences that have shaped her into the renowned chef she has become. She was the culinary consultant for the 2019 Netflix film Always Be My Maybe. Personal life Nakayama is married to Carole Iida-Nakayama, who serves as her sous chef.

They have toured Europe and Asia and have made festival appearances at Reading and Leeds, Download and Ghostfest. They have also been covered in magazines such as the NME and Kerrang!.  History  The band was formed in 2005 by guitarist James Goodman and drummer Adam Evans, the lineup was completed by bassist Dale Williams and vocalist Gareth Arnold. With this lineup they played shows in the South Wales area and recorded the Life Is Our War EP. This lineup lasted the rest of the year and then members left for various reasons. 2006 saw Goodman link up with new vocalist Ajay Jones who would become the face of the band for the next eight years. He also brought bassist Emlyn Lamb into the fold and with this lineup they recorded the Never Turn Back EP and started making a name for themselves nationwide touring with bands such as Baysix. Further lineup changes saw Evans being replaced on drums by Richard Dyas and the addition of Jordan Murray on second guitar. With this lineup they recorded the rare South Wales Kings EP and continued to make a name for themselves on the UK scene. They remained quiet until 2008 when Nick Rix joined the band and push it to a darker side of hardcore releasing the Forgotten Soul record on Purgatory Records. Marc Richards would then replace Richard Dyas on drum duties and him and Rix worked forward towards the release of The Root Of All Evil in 2010 and Scatter The Ashes in 2012. The band supported the releases by touring extensively around the UK, gaining a reputation due to their intense performance and the tightness and got themselves places at many festivals (including headlining the Red Bull Stage at Hevy Fest 2012) and touring with bands such as The Acacia Strain, Cancer Bats and Terror.  Vocalist departure, change and new album  In 2012, it was announced that Ajay Jones had left the band, who justified this due to the increasing time pressure of the musician and his interests otherwise the band. Louis Gauthier having already filled in on tour duties replaced Jones and joined the band. The band toured all over the world making their mark; appearing at bigger festivals such as Reading and Leeds, Download, Brutal Assault etc. In early 2017, they released the album In Dark Places, which took a much darker and somber tone to previous releases, ditching the faster and aggressive hardcore style they had before, for a doomy more groove oriented sound but still managing to keep their recognizable hardcore tone they were known for.

The genus contains only one species, Pappochelys rosinae, from the Middle Triassic of Germany, which was named by paleontologists and Hans-Dieter Sues in 2015. The discovery of Pappochelys provides strong support for the placement of turtles within Diapsida, a hypothesis that has long been suggested by molecular data, but never previously by the fossil record. It is morphologically intermediate between the definite stem-turtle Odontochelys from the Late Triassic of China and Eunotosaurus, a reptile from the Middle Permian of South Africa. Description Life restoration Pappochelys had a wide body, small skull, and a long tail that makes up about half of the total body length, which is up to . The skull is pointed with large eye sockets. Several turtle-like features are present, including expanded ribs and gastralia that seem to be precursors of a shell. As is the case in Eunotosaurus, each rib is flattened into a broad blade-like structure with bumps and ridges covering its outer surface and a ridge running down its inner surface, forming a T-shape in cross section. The gastralia (rib-like bones covering the abdomen) are tightly packed and occasionally fused together, forming a structure similar to the plastron of turtles. Unlike turtles, Pappochelys has teeth in its jaws and two pairs of holes in the back of the skull called temporal fenestrae. The presence of two pairs of fenestrae make the skull of Pappochelys diapsid, as opposed to the anapsid skulls of turtles that lack any temporal fenestrae. Discovery Reconstructed skeleton of Pappochelys, with expanded ribs highlighted in yellow and gastralia in red Fossils of Pappochelys come from a rock group in Germany called the Lower Keuper, which dates to the Ladinian stage of the Middle Triassic, approximately 240 million years ago (Ma), and are restricted to a layer of organic-rich claystone in an outcrop of the Erfurt Formation in the town of Vellberg. Paleontologists have studied the Lower Keuper extensively since the early nineteenth century and the claystone layer has been subject to intensive fossil collecting since 1985, yet it was not until 2006 that the first fossils of Pappochelys were found. Since then, excavations by the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Stuttgart have uncovered 20 specimens of Pappochelys representing most of the skeleton. Relationship to turtles The placement of turtles on the reptile evolutionary tree has been a point of contention in the past few decades because of a disagreement between morphological and molecular data. Based on anatomical data alone, turtles appear to fall within Parareptilia, which is a basal clade or evolutionary group within Sauropsida (Sauropsida is the reptile clade). Parareptiles are generally characterized by the lack of temporal openings in their skull (but now most of them are known to have at least a lower temporal fenestra,) and lie outside the main group of reptiles, Diapsida, which includes all other living sauropsids (lizards, snakes, crocodilians, and birds) and is characterized by two pairs of temporal openings. In contrast, molecular data suggests that turtles lie within Diapsida, either as a subset of the Lepidosauromorpha (which includes lizards and snakes)‚Äîsupported by one microRNA analysis‚Äîor the clade Archosauromorpha (which includes crocodilians and birds)‚Äîsupported by almost all molecular analyses. Fossil of Eunotosaurus, a reptile less closely related to turtles than Pappochelys Fossil of Odontochelys, a reptile more closely related to turtles than Pappochelys Of the reptiles that most closely resemble Pappochelys, Eunotosaurus was originally classified as a parareptile and Odontochelys has always been classified as a stem-turtle (stem-turtles are taxa more closely related to turtles than they are to any other living reptile group, but are not themselves turtles). Since Eunotosaurus possesses both turtle-like and parareptile-like features, it has often been used to justify a parareptilian ancestry for turtles. The discovery of Pappochelys, which is clearly a diapsid, provides the first strong evidence from the fossil record that turtles belong within Diapsida. In 2015, Schoch and Sues incorporated Pappochelys, Eunotosaurus, and Odontochelys into a phylogenetic analysis along with parareptiles, turtles, and many other reptilian taxa to elucidate their relationships. Their analysis found support for a diapsid clade containing Eunotosaurus, Pappochelys, Odontochelys, and turtles, and placed this clade within Lepidosauromorpha. This clade was only distantly related to parareptiles, which was recovered as the most basal group within Sauropsida. Unlike previous morphology-based phylogenies (hypotheses of evolutionary relationships), Schoch and Sues's phylogeny was in agreement with molecular data. Below is a cladogram or evolutionary tree showing the results of their analysis, with stem-turtles denoted by the green bracket: Paleobiology The claystone bed in which fossils of Pappochelys were found was likely deposited in a lake setting, suggesting that Pappochelys may have been semi-aquatic like modern turtles. Although Pappochelys lacked a fully formed shell like modern turtles, its thickened bones may have helped reduce the body's buoyancy, making it a more adept swimmer. However, otherwise the anatomy has few adaptations for swimming. In addition, a histological study found that its limb bones had a thick outer wall and small, open (rather than spongy) medullary cavity, like only a few aquatic reptiles and completely unlike modern aquatic turtles. These features have also been recorded in terrestrial reptiles such as the modern lizard Sceloporus and Eunotosaurus, another genus of pantestudine with burrowing adaptations. This may indicate that Pappochelys had a burrowing or modestly aquatic lifestyle, rather than a fully aquatic one.

Broomfield was the first U.S. citizen to die fighting for the YPG during the Syrian Civil War. Biography Keith Broomfield was born in 1979 in Westminster, Massachusetts to Tom and Donna Broomfield. He worked as the production manager for the family's manufacturing firm Broomfield Laboratories in Bolton, Massachusetts. After a motorcycle accident and rediscovering his faith, Broomfield told his father he was called to fight in Syria. He joined the YPG on February 24, 2015 under the nom de guerre Gelhat Raman. Kobane On arriving to Kobane in February, 2015, he was transferred to the military academy of Kantona Kobane. He received his month-long basic training and had a translator on hand to help him. By March, Broomfield, now Gelhat, wanted to go to the frontline near Sexler, on the Euphrates River to the west of the city of Kobane. After several more weeks, with a new operation \\"Rubar Qamishlo\\" beginning, the axis of attack for the canton switched from west to south-east and east. By April, Broomfield reached the front line after joining the Kobane Sniper unit. There were a number of foreigners already there, as well as English-speaking Kurds. Broomfield chose to stay continuously in the front line from April until his death in June 2015. Despite lacking traditional military training, he adapted himself very well. Many of his comrades spoke highly of him as a great shot and a hard-worker. His Kurdish also slowly improved as well. However, the Kobane Sniper Unit was taking increasing casualties. Their commander, Heval Herdem (known as Musa the Sniper) was killed in early April. This was followed by the deaths of three more of the snipers, two more were wounded in explosions, another was shot through the chest, and several returned home or to Cizre Canton due to combat fatigue. On or around June 3, 2015, Broomfield was killed by enemy sniper fire.

Historical development During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the papacy amassed considerable power, as monastic reformers saw it as a way to counter corrupt bishops while bishops saw it as an ally against the interference of secular rulers. As early as the fourteenth century, opposition to this centralization of papal authority had developed, with Bishop Guillaume Durand proposing at the Council of Vienne that local hierarchies and regional synods be strengthened. This opposition to centralization was tested when a group of cardinals, allied with secular rulers, called a council to resolve the Great Schism of the Western Church (1378 ‚Äì 1417), in which several rivals had claimed to be pope. The Councils of Pisa and Constance claimed authority to judge the popes, deposed various claimants, and elected Pope Martin V. The Council of Constance also claimed that all Christians, including the Pope, were bound to obey councils \\"in matters pertaining to faith, the ending of the schism, and the reform of the church.\\" This claim was short-lived and the conciliar movement soon ran out of steam. The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a period some church historians have called the \\"long nineteenth century,\\" saw a further consolidation of papal authority. In 1870 the First Vatican Council decreed the infallibility of the Pope's teachings, although during the council Cardinal Filippo Maria Guidi, O.P., of Bologna objected that the Pope teaches in consultation with other bishops. A further addition to papal power took place in 1917, with the publication of a new Code of Canon Law which gave the pope universal power to appoint bishops, ignoring the traditional principle of free election of bishops. This system of appointments, coupled with modern communications and the system of papal nuncios who could override local decisions, reduced the power of bishops and made the popes the \\"last absolute monarchs.\\"  Vatican II to 2013  Bishops who objected to this recent consolidation of papal authority proposed at the Second Vatican Council to use the traditional collegial model to limit the centralizing tendencies of the Roman Curia; unlike the conciliarists, who had maintained that an ecumenical council was superior to the pope, the advocates of collegiality proposed that the bishops only act with and under the pope (cum et sub Petro). Collegiality became one of the principal elements of the reform agenda and one of the primary points of conflict with the traditionalist minority at the Council. The reformers did not see this as undermining church tradition, but as going back to the original practice of Peter and the college of the Apostles. The traditionalist minority, however, opposed collegiality as undermining the authority of the Pope and changing the church from \\"monarchical to ‚Äòepiscopalian‚Äô and collegial.\\" In 1964 the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Lumen gentium, set forth the general principle that the bishops formed a college, which succeeds and gives continuing existence to the college of the apostles. The next year Pope Paul VI issued a letter on his own initiative, Apostolica Sollicitudo, which established the synod of bishops, while the Council's Decree on the Pastoral Office of Bishops, Christus Dominus, established general rules for national and regional conferences of bishops, urging their formation where they did not already exist. Since Vatican II there has been an ongoing debate about the authority of bishops' conferences between advocates of centralization of authority in the Vatican, who play down the importance of bishops' conferences, and supporters of decentralization, who emphasize their importance. In 1998, Pope John Paul II issued a motu proprio On the Theological and Juridical Nature of Episcopal Conferences (Apostolos suos), which has been described as \\"probably the most important post-Conciliar papal document on episcopal collegiality.\\" He stated that the declarations of such conferences \\"constitute authentic magisterium\\" when approved unanimously by the conference; otherwise the conference majority must seek \\"the recognitio of the Apostolic See,\\" which they will not receive if the majority \\"is not substantial.\\"  Pope Francis  From the beginning of his papacy Pope Francis, who had twice been elected head of the Argentine Bishops' Conference, has advocated increasing the role of collegiality and synodality in the development of Church teachings. He put this concern into practice when he urged the Synod of Bishops to speak with parrhesia (\\"boldly\\") and without fear, unlike the situation in earlier synods where officials of the curia would rule out discussion of contentious issues. A further example is the unprecedented degree to which he drew on the teaching documents of fifteen national bishops' conferences and two larger regional conferences from Latin America and Asia for his encyclical on the environment, Laudato si'. The Council of Cardinals examined the themes of synodality and the \\"healthy decentralisation\\" of the church during its meeting of February 2016. In September 2017, Pope Francis issued a Motu proprio, Magnum principium, in which he amended the Code of Canon Law to increase the responsibility of national conferences of Bishops for liturgical translations. The change has been described \\"as one of Pope Francis‚Äôs strongest moves yet in terms of fostering greater collegiality in the Catholic Church.\\" In September 2018 by the apostolic constitution Episcopalis communio, Francis introduced a more direct process whereby a final synodal document becomes a part of the Church's magisterium simply by receiving papal approval. The new constitution also provides for the laity to send their contributions directly to the synod's secretary general.

Education  Fernandes professionally trained as a ballet dancer, and would bind his feet in order to improve his form. Unfortunately, he tore his hamstring during his senior year in college, thus ending his dance career. He then went on to train as a visual artist and completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at York University in Toronto, and then pursued a Master of Fine Arts at the University of Western Ontario, in London, Ontario.

Noted for her eclectic style, she painted in many styles including cubism, futurism, fauvism, and orphism, she was one of Ireland's first abstract painters. Early life and education Mary Swanzy was born in Dublin on 15 February 1882, the second of three daughters of Sir Henry Rosborough Swanzy, an eye surgeon, and his wife Mary (n√©e Denham). The family residence was at 23 Merrion Square. Swanzy attended Alexandra College, Earlsfort Terrace, a finishing school at the Lyc√©e in Versailles, France, and a day school in Freiburg, Germany. This education meant that Swanzy was fluent in French and German. She went on to take art classes at Mary Manning's studio, under the direction of John Butler Yeats. Manning encouraged Swanzy to study modelling with John Hughes at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art. Living within walking distance of the National Gallery of Ireland, she spent a lot of time studying and copying the great masters. Swanzy's first exhibition was with the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) in 1905 with Portrait of a child, continuing to exhibit portraits every year until 1910. In 1905 she went to Paris, and worked at the Delacluse studio. She went on to attend the studio of Antonio de La G√°ndara in 1906, and took classes at Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re and Acad√©mie Colarossi. Whilst in Paris Swanzy was exposed to the works of Gauguin, Matisse, and Picasso, which made a lasting impression on her. Artistic career On her return to Dublin, Swanzy painted portraits and genre scenes and held her first show at Mill's Hall, Merrion Row in 1913. She held another show there in 1919, where she exhibited nearly 50 pieces. This exhibition was reviewed by Sarah Purser who noted the lack of melancholy and light optimism in Swanzy's Irish landscapes. Swanzy painted in a number of styles, often reflecting the major art developments in Paris. After the deaths of her parents, Swanzy was financially independent and could travel, spending her time between Dublin and Saint-Tropez during World War I whilst continuing to paint. She also exhibited with the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants in 1914 and 1916, being elected to the committee in 1920. Whilst visiting her sister who was involved with the Protestant relief mission in Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, Swanzy painted landscapes, village life, and peasant scenes. These works were shown in the autumn of 1921 in the Dublin Painters' Gallery with six other artists including Jack Butler Yeats, Paul Henry, and Clare Marsh with whom Swanzy shared a studio. Swanzy began to travel to more exotic countries from the 1920s, Honolulu around 1923, and later Samoa. As a result, she painted local tropical flowers, trees, and native women, with a palette and style similar to that of Fauvism. She stayed for a time in Santa Barbara, California, working in a local studio and exhibiting some of her Samoan work at the Santa Barbara Arts Club Gallery. She returned to Ireland in February 1925 and exhibited three of her Samoan paints at the RHA, and 14 at her one- woman how in the Galerie Bernheim Jeune, Paris in October 1925. Gertrude Stein wrote to Swanzy to congratulate her on her Paris exhibition. In the mid 1920s Swanzy settled in Blackheath, London, making regular trips to Dublin and abroad. In 1932 Purser held an exhibition of Swanzy's work for invited guests in her house. Purser's drawing room was the subject of one of Swanzy's work. At this time Swanzy's painting was influenced by orphism and was reviewed positively. Her work became more allegorical in later years, with The message in the Hugh Lane Gallery demonstrating this. During World War II Swanzy stayed with her sister in Coolock for three years. In 1943, she held a one-woman show at the Dublin Painters' Gallery, and she was also featured at the first Irish Exhibition of Living Art. She was exhibited at St George's Gallery, London in 1946 along with Henry Moore, Marc Chagall, and William Scott. Later life Swanzy was made an honorary member of the RHA in 1949, showing with them in 1950 and 1951. She did not exhibit in Ireland for a number of years, but the Hugh Lane Gallery held a major retrospective of her work in 1968. Following this she held two one woman shows at the Dawson Gallery in 1974 and 1976. In 1975 she was featured at the Cork ROSC and resumed showing with the RHA. She continued to paint until her death at her home in London on 7 July 1978. In 1982 the Taylor Galleries held her exhibition to mark the centenary of her birth. More recently Swanzy was featured in the Irish Museum of Modern Art 2013 exhibition Analysing Cubism. From October 2018-February 2019, also in IMMA, she was the subject of the solo exhibition Mary Swanzy Voyages.

It is often described as an Indonesian coconut pancake. Dadar gulung is one of the popular snacks in Indonesia, especially in Java. In Indonesian, dadar literally means \\"omelette\\" or \\"pancake\\" while gulung means \\"to roll\\". The pancake usually has a green colour, which is acquired from daun suji or pandan leaves. It is a green- coloured folded omelette or pancake made of rice flour, filled with grated coconut and palm sugar. It is commonly found in Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. The snack is commonly found in traditional marketplaces and Warung in Indonesia, especially in Java, Bali and other regions. In Malaysia and Brunei, it is known as kuih gulung, kuih ketayap and kuih lenggang. In Sri Lanka it is known as surul appam. Similar to Indonesia, in Singapore it is known as kuih dadar. Ingredients and cooking method Indonesian popular kue; nagasari, kue ku and dadar gulung. The batter is made from the mixture of flour, salt, eggs and coconut milk. Mix the batter with suji or daun pandan paste as green food colouring. To make the filling, combine the grated coconut flesh, palm sugar, salt, cinnamon and water in a pot on the stove. A tied pandan leaf is usually added to the mixture for aroma. The green-coloured batter is then cooked on a flat frying pan with a small amount of margarine, much in the same fashion as baking a thin pancake or omelette. Afterwards, the sweet coconut filling is placed upon the flat green pancake, and then folded on each side just like a tortilla, to create an elongated rectangular shape.

He made his film debut in the 1923 silent melodrama, The Bright Shawl, which starred Richard Barthelmess, Dorothy Gish, William Powell, Mary Astor, and Edward G. Robinson. Over the next 50 years, Rivero would appear in well over 200 films and television shows. He only made a handful of appearances in silent films. With the advent of sound films, he would appear in both English language films, as well as the Spanish language versions of English films, such as As√≠ es la vida, which was Spanish version of the 1930 film, What a Man. Life and career Born on July 25, 1890, in San Francisco, California, Rivero did not enter the film industry until he was in his 30s. Before making his start in films, Rivero studied to become a Shakespearean actor with the famous stage actor Robert B. Mantell. His first appearance was in a small role in the 1923 film, The Bright Shawl, which was produced by Inspiration Pictures, and east coast film company, and was shot in Cuba. His first featured role was in the 1924 western, Fast and Fearless, which starred Jay Wilsey (known by his stage name as \\"Buffalo Bill, Jr.\\") and Jean Arthur. He entered sound films in 1930 in the Spanish language films As√≠ es la vida and El presidio (the Spanish version of The Big House. During the early 1930s, while Hollywood was still making versions of films in different languages, Rivero continued to be cast in Spanish language films, his final one being 1934's Nada m√°s que una mujer, the Spanish version of Pursued. His first sound film in English was God's Country and the Man (1931), written and directed by J.P. McCarthy. During the 1930s and 1940s many of his roles were in westerns. Some of his more notable films during those decades include: the 1932 drama, Winner Take All, starring James Cagney; a small role in the 1935 biopic Diamond Jim, starring Edward Arnold and Jean Arthur; the role of Santa Anna in the 1937 historical drama Heroes of the Alamo; he had a small role in Betty Grable's first starring vehicle, Down Argentine Way (1940); he appeared in the bullfighting film, Blood and Sand (1941), starring Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell; he had another small role in the 1942 remake of Rio Rita, starring Abbott and Costello; he played one of the Spanish officials in the Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn comedic film, Woman of the Year (1942); he played a monk in The Song of Bernadette, starring Jennifer Jones; he played a waiter in the final Laurel and Hardy film, The Bullfighters (1945); he played a government clerk in Anna and the King of Siam, starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison; as a manservant in the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road picture, Road to Rio (1947); and the barber in John Huston's classic western, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). In the 1950s, he continued appearing in small roles in films, as well as acting in numerous television programs. His appearances in more notable films during that decade include: Broken Arrow (1950), starring James Stewart and Jeff Chandler;Angela Aleiss, \\"Hollywood's Ideal of Postwar Assimilation: Indian/White Attitudes in Broken Arrow\\", MFA Thesis, Columbia University, 1985, pp. 9‚Äì22, 25‚Äì43.

Rivero began appearing in television shows during the 1950s. His many roles during the decade include guest appearances on The Adventures of Kit Carson, Adventures of Superman, The Lone Ranger, Broken Arrow, and Rawhide. Rivero took a break from acting from 1960 through 1964, returning to his career in 1965. During the remainder of the 1960s and into the 1970s, Rivero worked almost exclusively on the small screen.

First performed on 24 December 1910 in Amsterdam, it is one of Heijermans' lesser-known plays. Plot The play follows the family of Prosper Bien Aime, who own a run-down pension. Their lives are turned upside down when Prosper's estranged brother unexpectedly shows up and dies at the dinner table, leaving the others to sort out what to do with his sizable inheritance. Another unexpected guest, the brother's wife Pollie, disturbs these plans, especially when it turns out she's pregnant (leading Prosper to call for beschuit met muisjes, a traditional Dutch snack served when babies are born). Performances The play has been performed by Amsterdam company Toneelgroep Oostpool (and its predecessor, Toneelgroep Theater). In 2014 Oostpool presented the play on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Heijermans' birth, in a performance praised in de Volkskrant. A review by Henri Drost for the Theaterkrant was strongly negative, and said the strong text deserved a better production.

Abee is known for writing poetry, short stories, and novels. He often draws on Los Angeles culture for his imagery and inspiration.  Writing style  Abee is known predominantly as a Los Angeles writer. His poetry is known for its sense of place, focusing on the day-to-day of Southern California life. In a review of Abee's volume of poetry King Planet, Salon wrote that \\"Abee chronicles the pavement and hills of Southern California.\\" His writing style has been characterized as \\"neo-beat,\\" with accessible, everyday language. Abee's novel, Johnny Future, received mixed reviews. The book follows the adventures of its Nyquil-guzzling, hallucinating, titular character, Johnny Future. MostlyFiction described the character as a mix between Holden Caulfield and Huckleberry Finn, and praised the character's uniqueness. Publishers Weekly, on the other hand, found that the main character lacked depth and was too bizarre to make the book enjoyable. Abee began writing while working as an 18-year-old orderly at St. John's Hospital. He told the Los Angeles Times that experiences such as \\"pushing bodies down to the morgue\\" helped inspire him.  Personal life  Abee was born at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California. His maternal grandmother moved to Southern California in the 1940s, and Abee says his family has lived all around the Los Angeles area. Abee grew up in Southern California, but went to Santa Cruz for college, where he discovered that people disliked Los Angeles, he told KCET. This animosity toward his home deepened his affection for it. Abee lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two daughters. He is a high school English teacher.

In 1887 he was elected second of the three members for Paddington and all three were members of the Free Trade Party. His elder brother William was a member of the Protectionist Party and had campaigned unsuccessfully against Alfred in 1887.

Campbell House is a historic house on Main Street in Cherryfield, Maine. Built in 1828 as a Federal-style structure, it was altered in the mid-19th century to include a significant number of Italianate features. Built by a member of the locally prominent Campbell family, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 for its architectural significance, and is a contributing member of the 1990 Cherryfield Historic District. Description and history The Campbell House is set on the east side of Main Street, just south of the public library. The main block is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof that has a center gable at the front, twin end chimneys, and a square cupola. A long series of ells lengthen the house to the rear (east). Most of the house is finished in wood clapboards; the front is finished in flushboard. The entrance is centered on the western facade, sheltered by a hip-roof porch with turned posts and a spindled frieze. The front and side gables are fully pedimented, with round-arch windows within the field. A porch on the south side features Italianate brackets and chambered posts. The interior retains a significant amount of Federal period woodwork, but the dining room was clearly updated in the mid-19th century. The main block was built in 1828 by David W. Campbell, a descendant of General Alexander Campbell, a prominent local citizen during the American Revolutionary War. The ells and much of the Italianate styling were added in the mid-19th century, and the front porch, whose styling is more Queen Anne, was probably added in the late 19th century.

Biography He was born in the Spanish town of Montoro (C√≥rdoba) in 1930, and 1939 he moved to M√°laga with his family. In his youth, Estero studied Journalism and Political Science. He also studied piano, organ, and musical composition. He began his literary career in 1963, with poetry, a novel, and several plays which were systematically prohibited by censorship. Due to his grotescomaquias during the decades of 1960s and 1970s, Romero Esteo was considered as an eccentric due to the scandals caused by his works. Along with Antonio Mart√≠nez Ballesteros, he configured the Young generation drama of the protest theatre and critical to the political system, within the so-called New Spanish Theatre. His second work, Pontifical, which he sent to the New Theatre Festival of Sitges in 1966, caused a heated fight in the jury among the loyals to the Francoist regime and neoliberals. This 450-page grotescomaquia would overstep all the time limits of a play with a duration of eight hours. The play's immediate prohibition by censorship helped Pontifical secretly circulate among students in duplicate copies and become a symbol of the oppressed protest theatre. In 1967, he began working as an editor in the Madrilenian newspaper Nuevo Diario, from which, through his articles, he helped the authors and the most innovating trends of worldwide dramaturgy become known in Spain. In 1972 he premiered Paraphernalia de la olla podrida, la misericordia y la mucha consolaci√≥n, a show which was subsequently taken to Paris. In 1973, he premiered Pasodoble at the Teatro Alfil during the New Theatre Festival of Madrid. Both plays are performed throughout the national territory for several years. In the 1980s, he combined his job as a university professor in the Faculty of Philosophy and Arts of the University of M√°laga with his job as an author of theatre plays and stage director. With the performance of El vodevil de la p√°lida, p√°lida, p√°lida rosa, Romero Esteo premiered for the first time in a Spanish commercial theatre ‚Äìit was at the Teatro Jacinto Benavente in March 1981. Between 1983 and 1984 he was the director of M√°laga International Theatre Festival. In 1985, he was awarded from Strasbourg the Europe Prize for his work, published in 1983, Tartessos. On 15 July 1995 his play Pasodoble was performed in the hall Strassenbahndepot of Berlin. On 20 October 2008, he won the Spanish National Prize for Dramatic Literature, awarded by the Spanish Ministry of Culture for his work Pontifical, forty-two years after sending it to that New Theatre Festival in 1966. Work Romero Esteo cultivated the dramatic genre, but also he often approached the essay and more occasionally to poetry and novel. The Spanish linguist and academician Fernando L√°zaro Carreter said about Romero Esteo's work that he ‚Äúhad never seen our theatre go such a long way, neither in such an audacious and intelligent manner‚Äù and that ‚Äúin some of Romero Esteo's works we can find some of the greatest summits ever of European literature‚Äù. * El romancero de la mar y los barcos.

Cohen's h, on the other hand, quantifies the size of the difference, allowing us to decide if the difference is meaningful.  Uses  Researchers have used Cohen's h as follows. * Describe the differences in proportions using the rule of thumb criteria set out by Cohen. Namely, h = 0.2 is a \\"small\\" difference, h = 0.5 is a \\"medium\\" difference, and h = 0.8 is a \\"large\\" difference. * Only discuss differences that have h greater than some threshold value, such as 0.2. * When the sample size is so large that many differences are likely to be statistically significant, Cohen's h identifies \\"meaningful\\", \\"clinically meaningful\\", or \\"practically significant\\" differences.  Calculation  Given a probability or proportion p, between 0 and 1, its \\"arcsine transformation\\" is : varphi = 2 arcsin sqrt{p} Given two proportions, p_1 and p_2, h is defined as the difference between their arcsine transformations. Namely, : h = varphi_1 - varphi_2 This is also sometimes called \\"directional h\\" because, in addition to showing the magnitude of the difference, it shows which of the two proportions is greater. Often, researchers mean \\"nondirectional h\\", which is just the absolute value of the directional h: : h = left varphi_1 - varphi_2 right In R, Cohen's h can be calculated using the \`ES.h\` function in the \`pwr\` package or the \`cohenH\` function in the \`rcompanion\` package  Interpretation  Cohen provides the following descriptive interpretations of h as a rule of thumb: * h = 0.20: \\"small effect size\\". * h = 0.50: \\"medium effect size\\". * h = 0.80: \\"large effect size\\". Cohen cautions that: Nevertheless, many researchers do use these conventions as given.

Although the bridge has a 20th-century wooden deck on rubblestone abutments and pier, it is functionally similar to the bridge's original deck, which was also a wooden structure that may have existed as early as 1774. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a rare example of a bridge in the state with some essential 18th-century elements intact. Description and history The Grist Mill Bridge is located in a rural part of far eastern Lebanon. The Little River Road runs generally southward, roughly following the course of the eponymous river as it makes its way south to the Salmon Falls River in Berwick. A short way south of the Lebanon-North Berwick Baptist Church, the road crosses the river at a point where it makes an S-shaped bend to the west. Just downstream (west) of the bridge stands the Old Grist Mill, which was built in 1774. Documents describing this mill indicate that a bridge was already standing at this location when it was built. State records of the bridge include photographic evidence from 1924, and records noting replacement of its deck in 1885. Documentary references to bridges at or near this location were also made in 1792 and 1822, but none of the documentation predating 1885 is conclusively connected to the present structure. The stonework of the bridge supports bears some resemblance to that of the mill foundation and what remains of its dam. The bridge's oldest features are its abutments and single pier, all of which are dry laid rubblestone. These elements place the wooden bridge deck about above typical water level. The southern abutment includes a wing wall that extends for some as a base and retaining wall for the roadway. The bridge deck is long and about wide.

Open to the public and free of charge to both patrons and artists, the gallery was privately established for the benefit of lesser- known artists in Brooklyn by its founder and director, Sylvia Dwyer. The Gallery's exhibits of paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, and ceramics reflected many artistic movements of that era, including expressionism, realism, modern, non-objective, and abstraction. Throughout the 1960s, the gallery remained a center for artists and was heralded for its cultural influence on the neighborhood.Muir, Hugh O., March 27, 1964, Brooklyn World Telegram, EditorialHughes, Cindy (March 20, 1964), Brooklyn World Telegram. History Like many local artists, Ms. Dwyer displayed her work at the Washington Square Outdoor Art Exhibit in Greenwich Village. In 1957 she sold a painting to a lawyer who worked in a professional building in Brooklyn Heights. He then showed it to an attorney colleague, Alfred Lo Schiaro, and the two of them provided the seed money for the gallery. They introduced her to a dentist who had an office in their building, Dr. Samuel Bark, who opened his reception area to house the gallery‚Äôs first show.Walton, Richard J.

In June 1959, the landlord of the gallery's building filed a court case against the gallery, contending that it was an illegal tenant because the building was for \\"Professionals Only\\". The landlord attempted to evict the gallery and the ensuing legal battle was covered by local television and newspaper outlets. The case was heard by Municipal Court Judge S. Reymart Alter, although he was ultimately unable to render his decision as claimants withdrew their complaint. Judge Alter was quoted to say, ‚ÄúI regret the question was dropped.

She served the Royal Navy during the French Revolutionary wars and the early part of the Napoleonic wars before being sold in 1809 for breaking up. Design Hobbs & Hellyer built six vessels to Bentham's design. Dart was the second of a two-vessel class of vessels that the Royal Navy classed as sloops, and she and her classmate were the largest of the six vessels. The design featured a large breadth-to-length ratio, structural bulkheads, and sliding keels. The vessels were also virtually double-ended. French Revolutionary Wars  Dart was commissioned in August 1796 under Commander Richard Raggett. On 8 May 1798 Dart participated in Admiral Home Popham's expedition to Ostend to destroy the sluice gates of the Bruge canal. The expedition landed 1,300 British Army soldiers under the command of Major General Coote. The troops burnt the ships in the harbour and blew up the locks and gates on the Canal, but were then forced to surrender as adverse winds prevented their re-embarkation. In May 1799 Commander Patrick Campbell replaced Raggett. Campbell was in command when Dart was among the vessels that participated in what became known as the Vlieter Incident. On 30 August a squadron of the navy of the Batavian Republic, commanded by Rear-Admiral Samuel Story, surrendered to the British navy. The incident occurred during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland and took place near Wieringen on a sandbank near the channel between Texel and the mainland that was known as De Vlieter. Around this time Dart captured the sloop Jonge Jan. Dart also shared with gunboats , , and in the proceeds of the capture of the Hell Hound. This may have occurred on 7 October when the boats of Dart, Defender, Cracker, and Hasty, and the schuyt Isis cut out four gunboats from the Pampus, in the Zuiderzee. Three of the gunboats were schuyts, but one was a new, purpose-built gunboat armed with two 18-pounder guns in her bow and two 18-pounder carronades in her broadside. The three schuyts also carried four guns and carronades each. The vessels had crews ranging in size from 20 to 30 men. The British suffered no casualties.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.141. On 8 May 1800 Dart captured the Kaufhandel. Dart, captured D√©sir√©e on 8 July 1800 in the Raid on Dunkirk. D√©sir√©e was armed with 40 guns, those on the main deck being 24-pounder guns, and had a crew of 250 men under the command of Citizen Deplancy. However, a number of her crew were on shore. Dart lost one man killed and 13 wounded, including two officers badly wounded. Although several other vessels that participated in the raid had some wounded, Darts capture of Desiree was the raid's only real accomplishment. This capture resulted in Campbell's promotion to post captain and command of the frigate . French casualties were heavy. One account states that all the French officers, save a midshipman, were killed, and that casualties amounted to almost 100 men killed and wounded.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.77. Lloyd's List reported on 11 July that the \\"Grand Desiree\\", prize to the Dart, had arrived in the Downs, and that the French captain and about 50 men had been killed, and nine wounded.Lloyd's List, no.4067 ‚Äì accessed 25 June 2015. The French commander was capitaine de fr√©gate Lefebvre de Plancy, and French records show that he was mortally wounded in the action.Fonds Marine, p.235. The Royal Navy took Desiree into service, and many British vessels shared in the proceeds of the capture. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the NGSM with clasp \\"Capture of the D√©sir√©e\\" to all surviving claimants from the raid. Commander John Ferris Devonshire replaced Campbell in August 1800. Dart participated in the Battle of Copenhagen where she had an officer and two men killed, and one man wounded.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp. 66‚Äì80. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp \\"Copenhagen 1801\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. The Admiralty promoted Devonshire to post captain on 27 April for his role in the battle.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, pp.411‚Äì4. In June Lieutenant William Homan (acting) replaced Devonshire. In October 1801 Commander William Bolton replaced Holmann. Bolton paid off Dart in October 1802. Napoleonic wars Dart was fitted at Deptford between August and November 1803. Commander William Brownrigg commissioned her there in October, for the Downs. On 8 December 1804 Home Popham, in , sent Dart to provide support to the explosion ship Susannah and two carcasses in their attack against Fort Rouge and the pile battery there that protected the entrance to Calais.Fort Rouge was a seafort, built of wood and standing on piles. It was armed with 12 cannons and had a garrison of 50 soldiers. The carcasses were intended to set fire to the piles, but one carcass did not reach its target and the other, though it reached the piles, did not ignite and was retrieved. Susannah did reach its target. When it exploded it destroyed much of the west part of Fort Rouge, according to report from the cutter Fox which sailed in the next day on a reconnaissance. Brownrigg died in December 1805. Commander Joseph Spear was appointed to command Dart in January 1806. However, for much of the first half of the year he was acting captain of Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane's flagship, the 74-gun . Spear took part in the pursuit of a French squadron in June 1806 which had recently arrived in the Caribbean under Jean- Baptiste Philibert Willaumez. Spear then briefly became acting captain of the 74-gun . During this time Dart was under the command of Commander James Brown. Around this time Dart recaptured the Caledonia and sent her into Antigua. Caledonia had been sailing from New Brunswick to Antigua when a French privateer had captured her and sent her to Cayenne.Lloyd's List, no.4102 ‚Äì accessed 25 June 2015. After Spear returned to command Dart, with in company, captured the 8-gun schooner privateer Jeune Gabriella on 9 November 1806 at . Jeune Gabriella had thrown half her guns overboard during the chase. She was under the command of M. Auguste Boufford and had a crew of 75 men. She was out of Guadeloupe and had not made any captures. On 30 November there occurred an unfortunate incident when Wolverine fired on a British merchant vessel engaged in lawful trade. At 10pm, she and Dart came upon a ship that they suspected was a French privateer and that kept up a running fight until morning, only surrendering after her captain and several of her crew had been wounded, of whom six later died. The vessel turned out to be the British 24-gun slaver , out of Liverpool, under Captain Hugh Crow.Clowes (1897‚Äì1903), pp.394‚Äì5The slave trade was not, in 1806, illegal. The British Slave Trade Act 1807 abolished the trade by degrees, beginning in 1807. He had thought that the two vessels chasing him in the dark were French privateers out of Cayenne and was determined not to surrender his vessel without a fight. Commander Spear gave him a letter of praise for his determined resistance and the fight became something of a sensation; on his return home Crow received honour, glory and a substantial reward for his gallantry.The Archer's Register (1864), p.235-6 Also, \\"many of the wretched negroes were killed or injured.\\"Crow was a slaver who had earlier fought in two other engagements. The French vessel Robuste, of twenty-four 12-pounders and 150 men, had captured him in 1794. Then on 21 February 1800, as captain of Will, of eighteen 6-pounders and 50 men, he fought off a French privateer with the loss of three crewmen and two slaves killed and 10 wounded. He recounts his career and the fights in detail in his autobiography (Crow 1970). In January 1808 Lieutenant Thomas Pinto was promoted to Commander and given command of Dart.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 19, p.262. He took command on 9 February;Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, p.366. he paid her off in November. Fate Dart was broken up at Barbados in 1809. A statement during a Parliamentary debate in 1811 reports that, before she was broken up, Dart was serving as a guard ship in Carlisle harbour. One evening, while her captain was ashore, a seaman under confinement for disorderly behavior started making a great deal of noise. The officer on duty, a Lieutenant William Richards, had the man gagged which had the unintended result of the man dying, presumably of suffocation. The subsequent court martial acquitted Richards of murder, but dismissed him from the service.Cobbett (1812), pp.1028‚Äì34.

There was never a reason cited for why the festival was canceled, with SCMF's announcement only saying, \\"...the Disco and SMG teams work diligently to ensure every single time you enter the gates of Sun City Music Festival, the best possible experience awaits you. Throughout the calendar year, the SCMF team works extremely hard to meet this momentous task with rigorous standards in place. Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt believe that goal can be accomplished in 2018.\\" As of August 2020, the last update on the festival was by Disco Donnie stating: \\"*SCMF - its [sic] complicated *Starting A New Festival During a Pandemic - its [sic] complicated...

As a speaker, he helps groups understand the importance of perception in their daily lives through the art of magic and sleight of hand. In January 2006, he became the youngest magician to be featured in a Magic Magazine cover story centered upon his technical skills and early business success. In August 2015, Kimlat fooled the legendary magician duo Penn & Teller with an original card trick on their TV show, Penn & Teller: Fool Us. The appearance was notable for the duo's extreme reaction of bewilderment, with Entertainment Weekly describing Kimlat as the series' \\"best fooler yet.\\"  Early life  Kimlat was born in Kiev, Ukraine in 1983, and immigrated to Orlando, Florida with his parents, sister, and grandmother in 1992. His parents wanted a life away from Communism and the lingering effects of the Chernobyl disaster, and a life in which the family's Judaism would no longer be called into question. Both of his parents, Irina and Boris, had earned master's degrees in engineering in the Soviet Union. Boris had received two such degrees and held multiple engineering patents. According to Kimlat, \\"... that didn't matter when we got here. So they just started all over.\\" Kimlat first became interested in magic when he was 12 years old from watching The World's Greatest Magic on television. At age 14, he was regularly working in restaurants and at private events as a sleight-of-hand magician. By age 18, after graduating Winter Park High School, Kimlat had written his first book of magic and toured the United States lecturing to other magicians. He attended the University of Central Florida, where he studied philosophy, psychology, and literature. Kimlat graduated with an honors degree, after completing a thesis on the connection between philosophy and magic.  Business Highlights  Kimlat is the CEO of Event Magic International LLC, including sub-brands See Magic Live, Restaurant Magic Business, and ThinkMagic.  Businesses  = Keynote Speaking = Kimlat travels the country delivering corporate and sales trainings and keynotes of his trademarked Think Like A Magician‚Ñ¢ presentation, which combines his magic talents with business-focused presentations. > \\"The biggest lesson for businesses, or really, for anybody, is that you have > the ability to influence people's perception with your language, the way you > walk, the way you talk, the way you present yourself,\\" Kimlat said. > \\"Everything we do creates perception.

Book  Think Like a Magician is the title of Kimlat's best-known keynote presentation and forthcoming book. Kimlat helps businesses drive relationship- based growth by using the lessons of magic to see things from another person's perspective.  Television Appearances  Kimlat appeared on Season 2 of Penn & Teller: Fool Us on The CW Network and fooled Penn & Teller. On the episode, Kimlat performed a card trick using an original method, which involved shuffling a deck face-up-into-face-down, and then making all of the cards instantly face the same direction, except for Penn & Teller's selected cards. Penn, failing to understand how the trick worked, reacted with mock anger, lifting his stool over his head and throwing cards in Kimlat's face, while Teller reacted with delight, emitting audible giggles (rare for the typically silent performer). Penn highlighted Kimlat's performance on his podcast, Penn's Sunday School: > We did that exact trick on The Today Show. Teller and I know every method of > doing that trick. We know it inside out. That was [Kimlat's] kind of 'oh > well, that trick you did on The Today Show? I'm now gonna show you how it's > done.' When Teller saw his name pop on the introduction ... I saw Teller > just go, 'we've lost.' You know he's just that good. And when I finally > found out how he did it, I was so much more amazed. I wanted to run up and > tell people, 'do you know that he actually did this?' It's mind-blowing. Kimlat returned to Penn & Teller: Fool Us in 2018. This time, he performed an effect in which he \\"dribbled,\\" or cascaded a deck of cards from his hand down to the table. From the middle of the falling deck, he plucked out Penn's chosen card. The duo correctly guessed that Kimlat was not, in fact, performing a \\"trick,\\" but displaying a talent of skill. Penn said, \\"We don't think there was a trick. We think you actually did what you actually said you were going to do.\\" In reference to not fooling Penn & Teller the second time, Kimlat said: > It was a huge compliment. I selected this trick, knowing that if they > figured it out, they would essentially be acknowledging to the world the > time and effort that went into it. This was the rare opportunity to have the > method be acknowledged publicly and serve a greater purpose‚Äîto showcase to > the public the work that goes into perfecting a magic effect. After the \\"bust\\" Penn & Teller left their seats to shake Kimlat's hand on stage, an honor typically reserved for those magicians who fool them. While walking back to their judge seats, Penn told the audience, \\"He's better than you think, I'm telling you that.\\"  Community Involvement  Kimlat's team of See Magic Live magicians regularly perform at Orlando-area non-profit fundraisers.

He arrived in New South Wales around 1861, worked for a period as a porter and then became a tobacconist at Enfield. On 28 August 1865 he married Martha Nairn at Redfern; they had ten children. He was a local alderman and served as mayor of the Municipality of Enfield in 1889. He was a candidate at the 1891 election for the district of Canterbury. Whilst he was a Free Trader, he was not one of the four candidates nominated by the party, and was supported by a local branch, the Canterbury Electoral Freetrade Council. The election had been close with only 105 votes separating Thomas Bavister elected 2nd and Eve in 5th place, five votes behind John Wheeler, one of the official Free Trade candidates, who had been elected 4th. Eve lodged a petition against the election of Wheeler. The Elections and Qualifications Committee conducted a re-count which overturned the result and declared that Eve had been elected. He did not contest the 1894 election, but ran unsuccessfully in 1895 (Marrickville), 1898 (Burwood) and 1907 (Ashfield). Eve died at Mosman on 25 September 1911.

The Portico of Glory () of Santiago de Compostela Cathedral is a Romanesque portico and the cathedral's main gate created by Master Mateo and his workshop, on the orders of King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n. The king donated to Mateo one hundred maraved√≠s annually between 1168 and 1188. To commemorate its completion in 1188, the date was carved on a stone set in the cathedral and on the lintel that supports the richly ornamental tympanum. Under the contract made in 1168, if Mateo was to renege on the deal to create the portico at any time, he would have to pay 1,000 gold pieces (aureos). The complete three-piece set took until 1211 to completely finish; when the cathedral was consecrated in the presence of King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. Originally projected as a four-part division, it was modified into a three-part format, which changed the proportions of the entire portal. With over 200 Romanesque style sculptures, the portico is the artistic high-point of the cathedral and often considered the greatest work of Spanish Romanesque sculpture. The P√≥rtico de la Gloria consists of an inner double-arched porch and finished with an outer western fa√ßade. The lateral archivolts were left undecorated, which might have been due to time restraints to finish the gate for the Jubilee of 1182 and formal procession of pilgrims. The pure Romanesque fabric was altered slightly and later encased with a Baroque facade. Before the facade was erected, the portico would be seen from afar and would take pilgrims up a large flight of stairs to approach it. Without door valves, the three large arches were decorated with angels and foliage and framed the ciborium and altar at the end of the nave. Prophets and apostles form the columns and jambs welcoming pilgrims inside the church. Mestre Mateo inside the church on the opposite side of St. James Though the portal was originally poly-chromed, the numerous traces of the remaining paint seen today are due to later interventions. Records show that the portico was repainted often with contracts surviving from the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries. Two types of paintings are distinguishable now on the structure. On some of the figures, the paint is powdery; the colors are light, soft and clear without any additional ornaments. This dates back to the fifteenth or sixteenth century. The more enamel-like painting is harsher and darker with ornamental patterns dated back to the 17th century in a similar style to offering boxes in 1656. Concealed now by the Churrigueresque west front, the porch or narthex is no longer viewable from the exterior. The church is responsible for the preservation of the portal to this day. The doors were never closed day or night in the Middle Ages.In 1866, London's South Kensington Museum (today the Victoria and Albert Museum) displayed a full-scale though unpolychromed replica of the Portico de la Gloria, which exemplified the twelfth-century Iberian Romanesque.  Architecture  Rendering: Jenaro P√©rez Villaamil, Palacio de la Moncloa, Madrid Before initiating the work on the portico, Maestro Mateo's (Master Matthew) workshop finished the naves of the Cathedral by building a new crypt beneath the nave and the surrounding terrain. The portico consists of an undercroft that is used as a chapel called the catedral vieja. The width of the portico was governed by the western edge of the towers and limits its view; the porch measures approximately 57 ft by 13.5 ft. Because Mateo was confined by the horizontal space, he designed upwards and higher. He used an abundance of sculpted reliefs and three round arches that correspond to the three naves of the church, supported by thick piers with pilasters. Master Mateo was also influenced by the local tradition and sculpture of the Puerta de las Plater√≠as and the C√°mara Santa of the cathedral of Oviedo. French influence is seen in the iconography and composition with decorative sculpture similar to the details of the cloister of Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey. Style and technique are completely unique to Master Matthew and his group of masons and sculptors of varying skill level. At the time, design and iconography were decided by the archbishop, his canons, and Maestro Mateo. The Archbishop Pedro II was a francophile and a main influencer of the iconography on the portico. Examples include the simple, yet expressive monsters on the bases and the crude human figures. The portico seems to be the last known work of Master Mateo, although his studio continues to work under his name. Many diverse architectural features are combined including Cistercian and proto-gothic structures of France. The ribbed vault is large in scale and the first of its kind in Spain. The figure's style shows a combination of the humanistic tendencies used in manuscripts beginning in 1160 and the pilgrimage style of depicting individuals of early-twelfth century Compostela. There is a similarity in architecture between the south transept and the inner portal facing east. Capitals in the crypt transept and ambulatory have been linked to similar capitals in the Burgundian design and continues with the portico's large, rounded tympanum and double-storied jambs. The figures of the tympanum are made up of a large number of individual reliefs set up side by side. Those on the innermost jamb are not attached to the columns but rest like plaques. The portico represents the Written Law, the Law of Grace and the Natural Law, what can be called Glory. The central arch represents the final destination of true Christians: glory and resurrection. The left arch is decorated with sculptures of patriarchs of the Old Testament and Jewish people waiting for arrival of the Christ. The right arch represents the New Testament and the Final Judgement. Four angels blowing trumpets are carved in the four angles of the porch and symbolize the four corners of the world. The angels are not centered directly under the ribs and therefore do not support the weight of the vaults. The P√≥rtico de la Gloria operates as a highly symbolic narrative whose function is to combine the present and the individual act of pilgrimage with meaning; by inscribing them within the universal and the eternal. The pilgrimage to Compostela is a reenactment of the pattern of the life of Christ and the microcosm of Salvation. This suggests that individual pilgrimages achieve transcendence through its recapitulation of sacred events. Mateo's work on the portal inspired such great works as the western portal of San Vincente of Avila. Mateo's figures in the P√≥rtico de la Gloria were the first manifestations of the Gothic spirit in European sculpture. Mateo's style and that of his studio are materialistic in representation with plastic accentuation of the folds in the garments. After his death, his workshop suffered and a lesser quality can even be seen at the tympanum.  Central Arch  Christ with Evangelists and angelsThe central arched opening, twice as wide as the other two, has a tympanum and is divided by a central column‚Äîa mullion or trumeau‚Äîcontaining a depiction of Saint James. Its lower part is formed by the bases of the columns and decorated with fantastic animals. The middle portion consists of columns adorned with statues of the Apostles on the right and Prophets on the left. The sculpture is intended to serve as an iconographic representation of various symbols derived from the Book of Revelation and the books of the Old Testament. The Glory of Christ and the salvation of man are depicted in the central portal. Four beasts and 24 elders combine with the angels of the passion of Christ as an apocalyptic vision. This theme was first created at Abbot Suger's church of St. Denis near Paris.Below the Christ figure, Master Mateo has placed Santiago (St. James). In the Byzantine tradition, representations of Santiago as an apostle or evangelist bear no distinguishing features, apart from context, to differentiate James from other apostles. The trumeau statue of Santiago in the P√≥rtico de la Gloria, depicts a seated James, with nimbus, holding a scroll in one hand and a Tau-shaped staff in the other. Numerous sculptures of James bear witness to the Transfiguration, like the one which the Pilgrim's Guide describes as adorning the west front of the Cathedral at Compostela in the early twelfth century as a participant in the Last Supper.  Central Tympanum  The Tympanum with Christ Pantocrator shown as larger than the other characters.The arrangement of the tympanum is based on the description of Christ that John the Evangelist makes in Revelation (Chapter 1 v 1 to 18). In the center, the Pantocrator is shown, displaying in his palms and feet the wounds of crucifixion. Christ sits and occupies the center at nearly four yards in height. The Evangelists form a tetramorph around Christ and have emblematic animals on their knees: St. John, an eagle; St. Luke, a lamb; St. Mark, a lion; St. Matthew writes on a scroll. Eight angels stand on the base of the tympanum with four on each side holding the instruments of the Passion. On the far left, a small figure kneels and supports the column. Two angels stand to the left of Mark and Luke, holding a cross between them. The next angel holds a crown of thorns. The four angels on the right are all standing. The first holds four nails in his right hand and a spear in his left. The next angel holds the jar of vinegar (Gallegan jarro or water-pot) in his left hand and the scroll on which Pilate wrote Christ's sentence. The letters \\"I N R I\\" can be seen on the scroll. The next angel holds the thong used at the flagellation. The last angel on the right corresponds to the small size of the far left angel and carries the rod with the sponge. The angel's feet stand on clusters of foliage. Behind the two raised hands of Christ are two angels bearing censers. The space remaining on either side of the tympanum above the angels is filled with thirty-eight small figures, nineteen on either side of Christ. These figures are believed to represent either the citizens of the Holy City of Isaiah redeemed by their savior or the \\"ten thousand times ten thousand\\" who sing a new song. They are crowded with some holding their hands in prayer, some carrying scrolls, others books, and eyes carved looking at Jesus. The far left and right end of the tympanum bears archangels and hold the symbols of the Passion on the capital of the third shaft of the left and central arch. Both angels are holding a naked figured representing a human soul towards Christ. These naked figures symbolize the Gentiles on the right of Christ and the Jews on the left. On the outside of both these angels are two more angels of the same size. The angel on the left is leading two children and the one on the right leading three and holding one in his arms. This illustrates Isaiah's prophecy \\"the barren woman should have more children than she who had a husband.\\"  Central Archivolt  Musicians using string and various other instruments. The central opening is composed of three rows of radial archivolts decorated with a great amount of foliage. Flowers cover the vault while angels carry and lead souls to Paradise, symbolizing the Day of Judgment and praising the lord. Above the heads of these angels, two large groups of souls of the blessed, forty in all. Around the inner side of the arch contains the elders of the Apocalypse. Each is holding a musical instrument, as if preparing a concert in honor of God. Among instruments, ducal crowns are placed on their heads and some carry vessels. The figures are seated on a divan and are conversing two by two with the exception of the eleventh figures from each side. The elder's instruments include an organistrum, guitar, cittern, harp, aulos, and eight violas along with percussion instruments including bells, tambourines, and castanets. One of the instruments is an early vihuela, which is a stringed instrument and one of the earliest incarnations of a guitar.  Mullion  St. James in central column to welcome travelers The portal's doorway is so broad that its lintel must be supported by a trumeau or mullion in the form of a huge composite column. In the mullion, the figure of Saint James is seated with a pilgrim's swagger stick in one hand, as a patron of the basilica where pilgrims kneel and kiss or touch on their way into the nave. He holds a scroll in the other hand which contains the words \\"Misit me Dominus\\" (the Lord sent me). He wears a crystal studded nimbus which dates later than the figure. Two lions support the legs of his chair. The capital above his head represents the temptations of Christ. On the side facing the inside of the temple, two kneeling angels pray. At the foot of the saint is another capital with the figures of the Holy Trinity. Beneath this is the tree of Jesse, the name given to the family tree of Jesus Christ from Jesse, father of King David. This symbol of the human genealogy of Christ is the first time that this subject is represented in religious iconography in the Iberian Peninsula. The column rests on a base where there is a bearded figure (perhaps an image of Noah) with arms extended over two lions with open jaws. The writing here is no longer legible. At the foot of the central column looking towards the main altar of the cathedral, is a secular, kneeling figure of a young man with curls symbolizing Master Mateo, holding a sign that is written \\"Architectus\\" and an inscription dating the completion of the principal portal. This image is popularly known as \\"Santo dos croques\\" with the tradition of students rubbing their heads against the figure for wisdom and allowing pilgrims to this day to come and rub their little one's heads against that of Maestro Mateo, believing it will increase their understanding. This tradition was adopted later by pilgrims, although steps are being taken to remove access to stop the deterioration of the work.  Jambs  In the columns of the central door and the two side doors, are figures of apostles, prophets and other figures with their symbolic attributes. All are topped with their own elaborately carved capital, which depict different animals and human heads with leaf motifs. The names of some of the figures are on the books or scrolls that they hold in their hands. The scrolls symbolize the Old Testament while closed books are meant to be the Apostles or the New Testament. Four Apostles: Saints Peter, Paul, James and John the Evangelist. (from left to right) The columns display lifelike figures continuing the size of the St. James on the central shaft. The jambs on the left have Jeremiah, Daniel, Isaiah and Moses from left to right.Jeremiah is the figure holding a scroll written \\"Hieremias Propheta.\\" Next, Daniel is displayed as a handsome young man with smiling face. To the right of him is Isaiah with a scroll in his right hand, a turban on his head to show rank and his left hand raising his cloak to his shoulders. Closest to the door is Moses, who holds the Tables of Stone with the word \\"Honora\\" (\\"Honor\\") visible. Isaiah, Daniel and Jeremiah carry scrolls with painted names probably copying the originals. St. Peter is the furthest on the left in pontifical dress holding three keys. Second, St. Paul has a book in his hands that can be read as the beginning of the Epistle to the Hebrews, \\"Multifarium multisque.\\" Next is St. James dressed in a double tunic with the inner tunic white and is carrying a scroll with the words \\"Deus autem incrementum.\\" The opposite columns on the right of the central arch are the four Apostles: Saints Peter, Paul, James and John the Evangelist.The double representation of St. James is mirrored in the braided scarf depicted on both columns. The farthest on the right is St. John who stands on an eagle. He opens a book to the words of the Apocalypse, \\"Vidi civitatem sanctem Hierusalem.\\" All of these figures are standing with realistic expressions, discussing together like worldly sages. The support of the lateral arches have four figures on the pillars with two figures on either side that correspond with the columns of the central arch. The figures below the northern arch are possibly Amos and Moses on the left side and Obadiah and Joel on the right. Below the southern arch on the left are the apostles Philip and Andrew followed by Bartholomew and Thomas on the right.Left of central arch: prophets Jeremiah, Daniel, Isaiah and Moses. The coloring once common to much Romanesque sculpture has been preserved. There are three more statues on either side of the outer doors corresponding to the column figures. On the left, there is Queen Esther, Judith and Job or Tobias. On the right, there is St. John the Baptist, St. Luke and St. Mark. Only three shafts besides the central one are carved. The shafts to the left and right of the central column are spiral carved bas-relief. On the left, the sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham is represented. On the right are the Counsels given to the church in the Epistle to the Ephesians. The last shaft carved is to the right of the north arch and shows a medieval tournament and is believed to have replaced a non-decorated shaft at a later date. The shafts have strong verticals accents and emphasize strength and support of the piers.  Left door  The arch of the left door, the northern portal, depicts scenes from the Old Testament, with an upper and lower band with the righteous awaiting the arrival of the Savior. In the center of the lower archivolt is God the Creator who blesses the pilgrims and holds the Book of Eternal Truth. To his right is Adam (naked), Abraham (with his index finger raised) and Jacob. With them are two figures that could be Noah (new father of humanity to save from the flood) and Esau or Isaac and Judah. To the left of God there is Eve, Moses, Aaron, King David and Solomon. Above that, the second archivolt has twelve small figures representing the twelve tribes of Israel. Angels lead figures to paradise surrounded by foliage in the north portal. The figures in dense foliage holding scrolls contain the word of God as revealed to the Jews, but are bound by heavy moldings symbolizing the Judaic Law which imprisons them. Right door Right Door with two busts in each archivolt The arch of the right door, the southern portal, represents the Last Judgment. The double archivolt is divided into two equal parts by two heads in the center flanked by cartouches. Some authors identify these heads with the figures of archangel Michael and Christ. For others, they are Christ-Judge and an angel or may indicate God the Father and God the Son. To the right of these heads, Hell is represented with figures of subhuman monsters or demons that drag and torture the souls of the damned enslaved by passions representing Violence, Cruelty, Rapine and Gluttony. On the left, Heaven is represented with the elect, with figures of angels with children symbolizing the saved souls. Four angels trumpet the Last Judgment while the rest of the angels sing. The two busts of Christ symbolize his presence that brings mercy and salvation for all. His physical body is unnecessary and not represented here.  Bases  The four pillars of the porch are sustained on strong plinths carved with groups of various animals: six eagles, a bear, four lions and two indeterminate animals, as well as three human heads with beards holding the entire portico up on their backs. In these grotesque animal figures, there are images of demons and symbolize the weight of the glory crushing sin. Other sources give an apocalyptic interpretation with wars, famine and death (represented by the beasts) and situations that can only be saved with human intelligence represented by the heads of old men.

Composed between 1893 and 1895, it is Satie's only liturgical work and the culmination of his \\"Rosicrucian\\" or \\"mystic\\" period. It was published posthumously in 1929. A performance lasts around 18 minutes. History Erik Satie, c. 1895 In the early 1890s, Satie's fascination with medieval Catholicism, Gothic art and Gregorian chant led him to explore religious influences in his life and music. At first he was drawn to Jos√©phin P√©ladan's Rose + Croix movement, for which he acted as official composer from 1891 to 1892, and after breaking with P√©ladan he associated with the occultist writer Jules Bois, publisher of the religious esoteric journal Le coeur. At the same time he was immersed in a bohemian lifestyle as a pianist at Montmartre cabarets, where his already eccentric behavior took on a growing penchant for buffoonery and exhibitionism.Patrick Gowers and Nigel Wilkins, \\"Erik Satie\\", \\"The New Grove: Twentieth-Century French Masters\\", Macmillan Publishers Limited, London, 1986, p. 131. Reprinted from \\"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\", 1980 edition. This paradox came to a head in October 1893 when Satie founded his own mock religious sect, the √âglise M√©tropolitaine de l'Art de J√©sus Conducteur (Metropolitan Church of Art of Jesus the Conductor), with himself as High priest, choirmaster, and sole member. It was a spoof of the flamboyant P√©ladan, whose Rose + Croix creed (\\"the transformation of society through art\\") and habit of \\"excommunicating\\" his critics in bombastic letters to newspapers Satie gleefully adopted.Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\\", Oxford University Press, 1999, pp. 162-163, 170-171. He carried the charade into his daily existence, dressing in monkish robes and referring to his tiny room at 6 Rue Cortot as his abbatiale (abbey). \\"[Satie] liked to affect the unctuous manners of a priest,\\" his friend Francis Jourdain recalled. \\"They suited him so well, he played his part so accurately - being careful not to overdo things - that the question arose as to whether a slightly false air was not innate in him.\\"Quoted in Robert Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", Faber and Faber Ltd., 1995, p. 39. Against this background, Satie's motives for writing the Messe des pauvres - the sole composition linked to his church - are obscure. Originally entitled Grande Messe de l'Eglise M√©tropolitaine d'Art,Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 352, note 16. it was his most ambitious work to date, although there was no evident prospect of having it performed.Schwandt, \\"A New Gloria for Satie's Messe Des Pauvres\\", p. 38. Satie authorities Ornella Volta and Robert Orledge believe he conceived the mass to occupy his mind following his recent breakup with the painter Suzanne Valadon, which had left him emotionally devastated.Ornella Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, New York, 1989, p. 48.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 211. At the midpoint of their turbulent six-month affair in March 1893, Satie had composed his Danses gothiques as a \\"Novena for the great calm and profound tranquility of my Soul\\"; similarly, the first mass movement he completed (in late 1893) was the Pri√®re pour le salut de mon √¢me (\\"Prayer for the salvation of my soul\\").Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 279. It is unknown how the mass assumed its final title Messe des pauvres. The texts Satie chose make no reference to the poor at large, giving further weight to speculations that, impoverished as he was, he essentially wrote the mass for his own solace. 6 Rue Cortot in Montmartre, Paris, where Satie lived from 1890 to 1898. The Messe des pauvres was composed here In 1895, a substantial cash gift from a friend enabled Satie to publish a series of tracts in which, under the guise of his church, he criticised those of whom he disapproved. Portions of the Messe des pauvres appeared in two of them: an extract from the Commune qui mundi nefas in a pamphlet of the same name (January 1895), and the complete Dixit Domine - calligraphed in faux Gregorian notation by Satie - in the brochure Intende votis supplicum (March 1895).Facsimiles of both scores appear in Nigel Wilkins (ed.), \\"The Writings of Erik Satie\\", Eulenburg Books, London, 1980, pp. 38-42. The only contemporary account of the mass is an article by the composer's brother, Conrad Satie, published in the June 1895 issue of Le coeur. He described it as a work in progress, humbly scored for organ and a choir of children's and men's voices. \\"This mass is music for the divine sacrifice, and there will be no part for the orchestras which, I'm sorry to say, find their way into most masses,\\" he wrote.Conrad Satie, \\"Erik Satie\\", Le coeur, June 1895, pp. 2-3. Quoted in Robert Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", Faber and Faber, London, 1995, pp. 49-50. He also made an intriguing statement about its structure: \\"Between the Kyrie and the Gloria a prayer is inserted called Pri√®re des orgues.\\" The Gloria movement was not found in Satie's posthumous papers and is considered lost. Soon after his brother's article appeared, the unpredictable Satie lost interest in his church, the mass, and in composition altogether. That same month he exchanged his robes and religious affectations for the seven identical sets of corduroy suits that would come to define his \\"Velvet Gentleman\\" phase,Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. xxiii, xxiv. and for the better part of two years he wrote nothing. In his next important work, the Pi√®ces froides for piano (1897), Satie revisited the pre-Rose + Croix style of his Gnossiennes and turned his back on the mystical-religious influences he would later dismiss as \\"musique √† genoux\\" (\\"music on its knees\\").Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 73. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. The mass was not performed during his lifetime. After Satie's death in 1925, his friend and music executor Darius Milhaud brought the forgotten manuscript of the Messe des pauvres to light. Three of the movements (the Pri√®re des orgues, Commune qui mundi nefas, and Pri√®re pour le salut de mon √¢me) were premiered by organist Paul de Maleingreau at the Concerts Pro Arte in Brussels, Belgium, on May 3, 1926. An early complete performance was led by Olivier Messiaen at the √âglise de la Sainte-Trinit√©, Paris on March 14, 1939.Peter Hill, Nigel Simeone, \\"Messiaen\\", Yale University Press, 2005, p. 82. The work was first recorded in 1951. Setting The published score presents the mass in seven movements:According to Robert Orledge, Satie listed the opening organ solo (Prelude) as a separate movement, even though it serves to introduce the material of the Kyrie which follows without a break. With the missing Gloria the mass would have had nine movements. See Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 279. :1. Kyrie eleison (Lord, have mercy) :The most substantial movement and the only surviving section set to the :Ordinarium. A lengthy organ prelude establishes six motifs inspired by :the words \\"Kyrie eleison\\", which are then alternately sung by low and high voices :2. Dixit Domine (The Lord said) :The opening words of Psalm 110 (Vulgate 109), the first psalm of Vespers on Sundays :and major feast days, sung in unison by the choir. The original publisher garbled the text, :which should read \\"Dixit Dominus Domino meo / Sede a dextris meis\\"Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 280. :3. Pri√®re des orgues (Organ Prayer) :Organ solo :4. Commune qui mundi nefas (Thou, that Thou mightst our ransom pay) :Organ solo. The title is Line 9 of the hymn Creator alme siderum, used at Vespers during :Advent :5. Chant eccl√©siastique (Ecclesiastical Chant) :Organ solo, on two-stave score for the manuals alone. \\"Chant eccl√©siastique\\" :is (or was) a generic French term for Gregorian plainsong :6. Pri√®re pour les voyageurs et les marins en danger de mort, √† la tr√®s bonne et tr√®s auguste ::Vierge Marie, m√®re de J√©sus (Prayer for travellers and sailors in danger of death, to ::the very good and very august Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus) :Organ solo, manuals only :7. Pri√®re pour le salut de mon √¢me (Prayer for the salvation of my soul) :Organ solo, manuals only As Conrad Satie noted, the work was intended for organ, children's choir and men's voices, but as the score designates only basses and dessus (high) vocal parts a mixed adult choir is commonly used in performance. The choral writing is strongly reminiscent of plainsong. Caeremoniale Parisiense (1662) In its existing state - two choral movements followed by a series of organ solos - the Messe des pauvres does not conform to any liturgical tradition; but this is partly a result of circumstance. Satie's probable model was the organ mass,Douglas Earl Bush, Richard Kassel, \\"The Organ: An Encyclopedia\\", Psychology Press, 2006, pp. 384-385. in which instrumental pieces (versets) were composed to replace sections of the Ordinarium or Vespers (evening service) that were otherwise chanted or sung; these were performed in alternatim with the chorus and usually improvised by the organist.Bush and Kassel, \\"The Organ: An Encyclopedia\\", pp. 384-385. The genre was most prevalent in France from the mid-1600s. While the French Catholic church attempted to regulate the alternation of chant and organ in mass performance, beginning with the Caeremoniale Parisiense of 1662, its edicts were commonly ignored as regional parishes established their own alternatim mass traditions. Famous Parisian organists such as Claude Balbastre and Louis James Alfred Lef√©bure-W√©ly introduced dances and other secular influences into their liturgical improvisations.David Ponsford, \\"French Organ Music in the Reign of Louis XIV\\", Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 188.Barrett-Benson, \\"The Effects of the Revolution on the Organ Mass in France\\". Pope Pius X would ban the alternatim practice altogether in 1903,Joseph Peter Swain, \\"The A to Z of Sacred Music\\", Rowman & Littlefield, 2010, p. 157. but in the meantime the flexibility the French variety offered can only have appealed to Satie, who was never content with rigid musical forms of any kind. Then there is the loss of the Gloria, the original fourth movement of the Messe des pauvres. Its inclusion would have made the work acceptable for use in a church service as a missa brevis, albeit a rather unorthodox one.Schwandt, \\"A New Gloria for Satie's Messe Des Pauvres\\", p. 39. Examining the score in the 1980s, Robert Orledge found \\"sprawling uncertainties\\" in its \\"assortment of movements\\" and believed the mass was left unfinished.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 164 and p. 352, note 16. Sketches of two or three pieces from Satie's notebooks of the period may relate to the work, but whether he planned to expand it or to provide plainsong-like text settings for some of the organ solos must remain speculative.The sketches are titled Spiritus sancte deus miserere nobis, Harmonies de Saint-Jean, and Mod√©r√©. See Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 280.Schwandt, \\"A New Gloria for Satie's Messe Des Pauvres\\", pp. 39, 44. The mysterious stasis of the music, and Satie's unique reimagining of medieval modes with some of his most innovative harmonic writing, give the mass a haunting, timeless quality that is very effective in performance.Richard Langham Smith, Caroline Potter (ed.), \\"French Music Since Berlioz\\", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006, p. 178. Wilfrid Mellers saw in the works of the mystic period \\"a necessary step in Satie's creative evolution...technically they link up with plainsong and organum...not in any antiquarian spirit but rather because Satie saw in the impersonality, the aloofness, the remoteness from all subjective dramatic stress of this music qualities which might, with appropriate modifications, approximate to his own uniquely lonely mode of utterance.\\"Wilfrid H. Mellers, \\"Erik Satie and the 'Problem' of Contemporary Music\\", Music & Letters 23 (1942), p. 212. Reception An anomaly in both Satie's output and in liturgical music in general, the Messe des pauvres remains one of his lesser known large scale works. His first biographer, Pierre-Daniel Templier (1932), was almost apologetic over Milhaud's decision to publish the score, even though he found \\"real gems\\" in some of the movements.Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, p. 85. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932. Nevertheless, it has long had its advocates among Satie devotees. There are several arrangements, from musicians as diverse as David Diamond (1949) and Marius Constant (1970). Edgard Var√®se enthused, \\"I've always admired Satie and above all the Kyrie of the Messe des pauvres, which has always made me think of Dante's Inferno and strikes me as being a kind of pre-electronic music...\\"Ornella Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, New York, 1989, p. 106. And Virgil Thomson defined the inscrutable qualities of the mass thus: \\"It does not invoke the history of music. Its inner life is as independent of you as a Siamese cat.\\"Quoted by Alex Ross, \\"Critic's Notebook; Of Mystics, Minimalists and Musical Miasmas\\", New York Times, November 5, 1993. Thomson was one of Satie's most influential champions in the United States. The Messe Des Pauvres was performed at his memorial service in 1989.

Members of this corps may be tapped by the state for literacy and civic welfare activities. In 2010 the NSRC was mandated to be accredited and mobilized for the delivery of disaster risk reduction programs and activities. History The NSRC was created by virtue of Republic Act 9163, known as the National Service Training Program or NSTP Act of 2001. The NSTP Act mandated that all graduates of the non-ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) component of the NSTP, namely CWTS and LTS, shall constitute the National Service Reserve Corps. ROTC graduates on the other hand, shall become reservists of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The NSTP Law made ROTC a non-compulsory training component at the tertiary level of education. Furthermore, it made NSTP mandatory for all students in all higher education institutions (HEIs) and technical-vocational educational training institutions (TVETs) for courses of two or more years. Students have the freedom to choose among the three NSTP components. Since the enactment of the NSTP Law in 2001 until 2011 - a period of 10 years, the NSRC was never implemented despite the issuance of a joint memorandum from the Department of National Defense, Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) for its implementation. In May 2010, a new law was enacted - RA 10121. Known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010, this law mandated that the National Service Reserve Corps be accredited and mobilized for the delivery of disaster risk reduction programs and activities. Categories The NSRC units are classified into two categories: *Community- Based NSRC Reservists Units (CBNRUs). These are units organized at the barangay, municipal, city and provincial level. Graduates of the CWTS and LTS components of NSTP who are residents of these respective localities constitute the membership of the CBNRUs. *School-Based NSRC Reservists Units (SBNRUs). These units are organized by higher education institutions under CHED and technical-vocational education and training institutions under TESDA. Its membership is composed of graduates of the CWTS and LTS who are still happen to be enrolled in the said schools.

Anaya is an independent, non-political, non-profit organization. It is an active organization within Cambodia and in countries with a Cambodian population that has been scattered. Anvaya has over 300 registered members, collectively called ‚ÄúAnvayiste‚Äù or \\"Diaspora\\", across the world.  Origin of name and emblem  The name Anvaya (in Khmer script: ·û¢·ûì·üí·ûú·ûô·üà) comes from the Sanskrit language and means family or lineage. The Anvaya's emblem is a set of three lotus flowers, each symbolizing one of the continents of the Diaspora (Europe, America, or Oceania) which together represent Cambodia.  Creation  Anvaya was created in 2010 by Soreasmey Ke Bin, a French-Cambodian, and David Yim, a Cambodian-American. Upon returning to Cambodia in the early 2000s, they observed that Cambodians that wished to return to their roots had no kind of support system to help them. They then launched Anvaya as a free social network to gather people looking to return to their roots at regular events. In 2013, Anvaya became a fully legal registered association established by Soreasmey Ke Bin, its founding president. In 2013, Anvaya was legally registered as an association by its president, Soreasmey Ke Bin.  Organization  Anvaya is managed by a steering committee of 6 directors, each of which are elected by 30 members of the permanent council of the association with a two-year mandate. As of August 2016, the president of the association is one of the original co-founders, Soreasmey Ke Bin.  Mission  The main goal of Anvaya is to \\"ease the return of the Cambodian diaspora\\".A duty to our Homeland, a tribune by Mitty Steele, Anvaya's vice- president http://www.banyanblog.com/home/a-duty-to-our-homeland Anvaya's 4 key objectives are to: * Foster a sense of community among returnees through this social and professional network * Encourage and support overseas Cambodians in their effort to return * Inform overseas Cambodian about business, social and employment opportunities in Cambodia * Develop opportunities for overseas Cambodians to return, especially young professionals Anvaya aspires to catalyze and facilitate the rebirth of Cambodia through the collaboration and support of partners in the private sector, international institutions and government.  Members  All the members of Anvaya originate from Cambodia and have lived among the Cambodian diaspora communities. They may be in Cambodia or overseas. In March 2015, Anvaya had 300 members. Since the beginning of its official registration, Anvaya has counted on the support and the membership of leading characters of the Diaspora, such as the Cambodian society. Current prominent members include: * Two Cambodian government ministers: Sun Chanthol, Minister of trade; and Dr. Ing Khantha Phavi, Minister of Women * French-Cambodian film directors and producers, Rithy Panh, Davy Chou, and Visal Sok * Artists like Peap Tarr, Fonki, the cartoonist S√©ra, and singers such as Tony Keo (Canadian) and Laura Mam (USA) * Professional athletic members include Tep Rivihit, the general secretary of the Cambodian tennis federation and the N¬∞1 Cambodian professional tennis player Kenny Bun (French), as well as French-Khmer football/soccer players Thierry Chantha Bin, and Boris Kok. * Pily Wong, the former president of the French Chamber of Commerce, is an Anvaya counselor. * Entrepreneur and investor Thierry Tea is the founder of the PhilJets Group and Agama Investments, People of the Year awardee in the Philippines, and also a Foreign Trade Adviser for France. * The current president of Anvaya, Soreasmey Ke Bin, is also the secretary general of the French Chamber of Commerce  Financing  The association is financed by donations and membership fees. In 2015 the French Member of Parliament, Thierry Mariani subsidized Anvaya on his diplomatic reserve.  Activities  Anvaya has several types of activities to support their members in Cambodia and overseas, including: * An Afterwork event every second Thursday for members residing in Cambodia, * A monthly dinner revolving around Cambodian personalities from the government or from Cambodian society, including the French Ambassador, Mr. Jean-Claude Poimboeuf, the director Rithy Panh, the deputy Hun Many or the deputy from the opposition, Mu Sochua. * Symposiums on the purpose of the Diaspora at the French Institute of Cambodia in July 2012 and April 2013, * Khmer courses, both oral and literature, for Anvaya members in Phnom Penh, Anvaya also holds regular cultural and sporting outings. Some examples include: * Members accompanied Father Fran√ßois Ponchuaud to recall the events of April 1975, * Treks and outings in the forest such as tree planting or environmental-site cleaning projects to support community development. Anvaya furthermore has a football team in Phnom Penh, called Anvaya Keila, which may be replicated in Lyon (France). Besides this, some Anvaya members are distinguishing themselves in different sport competitions (tennis, half-marathon etc....)  Relationship with authorities  Although Anvaya is non-political, it keeps a strong open dialogue with Cambodian authorities within the government. For example, in October 2012, Anvaya went to the Royal Palace to pay tribute to the King Father Norodom Sihanouk. Anvaya was invited to this time of remembrance by Prince Norodom Ranariddh to be present in the capacity of an element of the civil society. A MOU was signed in March 2014 with the Cambodian Olympic Committee in which Anvaya was to recruit athletes from Diaspora for future sporting events such as the SEA Games and the Olympic games. In November 2013, Anvaya signed an agreement with the French Embassy to build a memorial for the victims of the Khmer Rouge. The monument was designed by Ing S√©ra, a French-Cambodian artist. The project was recognized by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia as a meaningful reparation for Khmer Rouge victims. The construction started in summer 2015, a first piece has been installed in June 2017, and the official inauguration is planned for October 2017.  Anvaya Reatrei  In March 2015, Anvaya organized its first Gala known as Anvaya Reatrei. This event gathered more than 150 people and awarded the \\"Members of the Year\\". Rithy Panh was awarded \\"Best Director\\", and Thierry Chantha Bin was awarded \\"Best Athlete\\". The French-Cambodian Borany Mam was awarded the best activist for her association ASPK and their efforts to restore and protect the painting at the National Museum of Phnom Penh. Tony Keo, a Canadian singer, won an award for musical performance. American-Cambodian Chanda Hun won \\"Best Entrepreneur\\", and Peap Tarr won \\"Best Designer\\".

IDM Project. Retrieved 4 August 2016  Characteristics   Individual  By assessing poverty at the individual level, the Individual Deprivation Measure enables accurate disaggregation of data by sex, age, disability, and geographic location.  Multidimensional  The IDM considers a wide range of factors as relevant to measuring poverty, assessing 15 key economic and social dimensions, including some especially important for revealing gender disparity (voice in the community, time-use, family planning and personal relationships).  Gender Sensitive  The IDM can be sex-disaggregated across 15 dimensions of life, including dimensions important to a gender sensitive understanding of poverty such as time-use, voice in the community and violence, generating a poverty-relevant gender equity measure.  Intersectional  The IDM collects data on 15 dimensions from each individual, so it can reveal the impact of intersecting deprivations and inform targeting of deprivations impacting particular populations.  Scalar  The measure uses a 0 to 4 poverty scale to assess the intensity of an individual‚Äôs poverty. Knowing how poor an individual is, and in what dimensions, matters for targeting policy and programming, and assessing the effectiveness of action.  Policy Relevant  The IDM can help governments and organisations target poverty more effectively as well as help them measure success or failure, revealing what aspects of poverty are changing, by how much and for whom.  Grounded in Participatory Research  The IDM is the first poverty measure in the world based on the views of women and men with lived experience of poverty. The dimensions were informed by how women and men think poverty should be defined and what needs to improve in order to move out of poverty.  History  The first research phase of the Individual Deprivation Measure started in 2009. It was a four-year, international, interdisciplinary research collaboration, led by the Australian National University, in partnership with the International Women's Development Agency and the Philippine Health and Social Science Association, University of Colorado at Boulder, and Oxfam Great Britain (Southern Africa), with additional support from Oxfam America and Oslo University. It was funded by the Australian Research Council and partner organisations. The research collaboration involved thousands of participants across 18 sites in six countries. Subsequent IDM research undertaken in Fiji was led by the International Women‚Äôs Development Agency in partnership with the Fiji Bureau of Statistics with contributions from the State, Society and Governance Program at the Australian National University. It was funded by the Australian Government‚Äôs Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development program. In 2016, the Australian Government provided significant investment in further development of the measure with the goal that by 2020 the IDM is ready for global use as an individual measure of deprivation and a tool for tracking progress against the 2030 Global Goals. This program is a partnership between the Australian National University, the International Women's Development Agency and the Australian Government through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Supporting the Global Goals  The Individual Deprivation Measure has the potential to help achieve the objectives of the 2030 Global Goals for Sustainable Development. The Global Goals require data and evidence to inform prioritising, action and monitoring if they are to be achieved. Recent adoption of the indicators for the Global Goals for Sustainable Development has underlined the importance of individual-level data to support targeting of policy and programming towards achieving the Global Goals, and ensuring that no one is left behind. The IDM can support the Global Goals by reducing the gender data gap, providing rich, multidimensional data about the lived experience of individual women and men in relation to core economic and social dimensions that people experiencing poverty have identified as important for defining and measuring poverty and deprivation. The IDM can also complement existing and improved gender-sensitive data collection, by showing how national results are translating into change for specific individuals and groups, and the relationship between dimensions and how this varies (for example, by age, disability, sociocultural background or rural/urban location).  Limitations  Additional IDM data collection is under way to inform further refinement of the measure with the goal that by 2020 the IDM is ready for global use as an individual measure of deprivation.

Temperance Hall Temperance Hall and the Colyer Refreshment Rooms, circa 19121 The site had long been associated with the temperance movement, having formerly been occupied by the Temperance Hall operated by the Brisbane Total Abstinence Society and located directly opposite the People's Palace (another temperance hotel operated by the Salvation Army). The foundation stone for the Temperance Hall was laid on 28 March 1864 by the Queensland Governor George Bowen, at which time the site was criticised as scarcely so central as one might desire. However, the Temperance Hall itself was not built until 5 years later at a cost of ¬£716. Planning for a temperance hotel William Robert Black ca. 1898 George Marchant The Canberra Hotel was built by the Queensland Prohibition League (later the Queensland Temperance League). The foundation stone was laid on Saturday 30 July 1927 by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane William Jolly with the intention to build a 5-storey building at a cost of ¬£95,000; coins found buried under the foundation stone of the old Temperance Hall were reburied under the Canberra's foundation stone along with current newspapers and documents relating to the affairs of the Queensland Prohibition League. The architect was Arnold Edwin Brooks. The building was financed by private benefactors, particularly William Robert Black and George Marchant, and through a low-interest loan from the Independent Order of Rechabites (a friendly society committed to temperance). There was ill-feeling that Black and Marchant were levied for gift tax by the Queensland Government in relation to their donations, but in July 1929 as the building neared completion, an act of parliament was passed to exempt these donations from gift tax. In January 1928, it was decided to add two more storeys to the building (seven in total) and to provide hot and cold water into each room, increasing the cost to ¬£120,000. The opening The seven-story concrete-reinforced building was constructed by Blair Cunningham and the Canberra Temperance Hotel was officially opened on 20 July 1929 by George Marchant. Portraits of the benefactors Black and Marchant were unveiled in the dining room; these had been commissioned from Sydney artist Norman St Clair Carter in January 1929. The dinner to celebrate the opening was marred by the Queensland Treasurer Walter Henry Barnes and Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Mick Kirwan walking out after the loyal toast. They had noticed that the order of proceedings had the toast to the Queensland Parliament as the last toast (after the toasts to the benefactors, the temperance league and associated societies, the architect and builder); they felt this was a serious breach of protocol insulting to the Queensland Parliament. Operations Despite doubts expressed by others, the Canberra Hotel proved that a high quality hotel could be successful without the sale of alcohol. It was very popular, attracting 442,001 guests between 1930 and 1935. In 1934, a decision was made to add a further 3 storeys with 200 beds in larger bedrooms with private bathrooms; the original architect Arnold Brooks had designed the building to be structurally able to be extended in this way. The extensions would make it the largest hotel in Australia. The Lamplight Bar at the Canberra was the first non- alcoholic bar in Queensland and specialised in virgin cocktails and was claimed to have the widest range of non-alcoholic beverages in Australia. As it did not serve alcohol, it was a popular choice for school formals and Methodist weddings. The wedding of Joh and Flo Bjelke-Petersen was held at the Canberra in 1952. In September 1952, it was announced that a second 11-storey block would be built in Ann Street between the existing hotel and the Brisbane School of Arts to provide another 200 rooms at the cost of ¬£200,000. Closure and demolition The temperance league sold the hotel in 1985 and the new owner applied for a liquor license and served alcohol for the first time on the premises on 3 March 1986. Mincom building, 2004 In 1987, the hotel was closed and demolished to build a 104-storey office tower called Central Place, which would have been the world's tallest building at that time; however; that project never commenced. Later an office tower for software developer Mincom was built on the site. Canberra Hotel (on the right), Toowoomba, Queensland, circa 1948 Other Canberra Hotels were established or planned in other Queensland towns by the temperance league. The Queensland Temperance League expanded its range of intervention and support programs from alcohol to include drugs and mental health. In 2015, it operates as Healthy Options Australia and is one of Australia's leading service providers in the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services in these areas.

He is a former member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from the 84th District, serving from 2014 to 2017. He is a member of the Republican Party. Corley resigned from the State House in early 2017 amid domestic violence allegations, to which he pled guilty. He resigned his seat before expulsion hearings could begin. Early life and career Corley was born in Augusta, Georgia to Kyle Corley and Shirley Corley on September 12, 1980. Corley graduated from Midland Valley High School in 1998, from the University of South Carolina Aiken in 2002 with a degree in political science, and in 2008 from the University of South Carolina School of Law. He was previously the youngest registered lobbyist in Washington, D.C. He also owned the Law Offices of Christopher Corley in Augusta, Georgia. Corley lives in Graniteville with his wife and three children. Electoral history In 2014, Corley defeated Adam Mestres, Rick Turnbull, and Lance Weaver in the Republican primary for the 84th district, which includes an area of South Carolina northeast of Augusta, across the Savannah River. Corley defeated Rosie Berry in the general election. In the 2016 South Carolina House of Representatives election, Corley ran unopposed. Corley has served on the Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Environmental Affairs committees. Political positions Corley introduced a series of bills proposing drug testing for recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) assistance, as well as limiting the benefits that able-bodied adults can receive. Corley supported a law granting reciprocity to gun owners from Georgia, as well as a failed effort to allow reciprocity for all concealed weapons permits. Corley had previously expressed skepticism about laws restricting individuals accused or convicted of domestic violence from possessing firearms. During the 2016 Republican Presidential primaries, Corley supported then-candidate Donald Trump and was his co-chairman in Aiken County. Confederate flag controversy Corley is an opponent of South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, the governor having previously implored \\"anyone\\" to run against Corley during his re-election campaign. In July 2015, he suggested the State of South Carolina should fly a white flag of surrender on the State House grounds in place of the Confederate Flag which was removed by the South Carolina General Assembly following the Charleston church shooting. Corley later sent Christmas cards featuring the Confederate Flag to his fellow Republican lawmakers, suggesting they \\"take this joyous time as an opportunity to ask for forgiveness of all your sins such as betrayal\\". Admission of guilt in domestic abuse In December 2016, during an argument with his wife in which she accused him of infidelity, Corley allegedly punched her in the face, pointed a Smith & Wesson SD9 VE 9mm pistol at her, and threatened to kill her in the presence of two of their children. Corley was arrested and charged with first-degree criminal domestic violence. Following a hearing, he was released on bond. The felony charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Corley could also have been suspended from the House of Representatives. On January 4, 2017, Corley was indicted on domestic violence and weapons charges and suspended from duties of office. He could have faced up to 25 years in prison. Later that month, on January 24, Corley resigned from the South Carolina House of Representatives. On August 7, 2017, Corley pled guilty to charges of first degree domestic violence and in exchange was given five years probation.

Bigge owned the manor of Little Benton and was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1750/1. He also by the late 1730s owned collieries, at Little Benton, Heddon-on-the-Wall, and East and West Heddon. In the early 1750s, Bigge acted as an agent for Charles Brandling, then a minor, making land purchases around Hunslet in Yorkshire. These were associated with the development of the Middleton Colliery. He was involved also in the construction of the Military Road, with its eastern end at Heddon-on-the-Wall. His brother Edward was a solicitor to the Commissioners for the construction.William Lawson, The Construction of the Military Road from Newcastle to Carlisle, 1751‚Äì1758 (1971), Durham University (PDF), pp. 228 and 53 Bigge enlarged his house at Benton House and bought into Witton and Coldcoats.

Practiced/Practitioners in the Philippines  Systems which directly originated from the Philippines and have practitioners residing in the Philippines. Not all systems have particular names as older practitioners only called their arts generic names like arnis, baston, escrima, etc. * Arnes Diablo - a style from Cebu focused on knife fighting taught by Lorenzo \\"Insiong\\" Saavedra to Zimo Saavedra then to Lucresio \\"Okit\\" Albano and Gregorio \\"Goyong\\" Ceniza. Senior students: Felipe Dabor, Cronie Cabatingan, Vernon Ompoc and Rene Capangpangan. *Balintawak Eskrima - Founded in 1952 by Venancio \\"Anciong\\" Bacon after internal dispute amongst some of the original founders of the original Doce Pares club. * Balintawak Sugbu - Balintawak Sugbu follows the original teaching method of Villasin Balintawak. Founder GM Carlo \\"Kaloy\\" Campa√±a *Bakbakan International - Founded by Antonio Diego, Rey Galang, Christopher Ricketts, senior students of Tatang Ilustrisimo. *Biagtan Ayura Cinco Teros - Founded by Maestro Raysaldo Biagtan, former Team Muaythai Philippines, ISKA Champion, World Silver Medalist, also founder of Biagtan Muaythai MMA and Author of the book \\"The Art Of Cinco Teros\\" Northern Philippines System. * Black Scorpion Arnis founded by Capt. Arthur Cuadrante Teodosio, reserve officer of the Philippine Army, in 1969. *De Campo Uno-Dos- Tres Orihinal (De Campo 1-2-3) - founded by Jose Caballero. * Derobio escrima - founded by grandmaster Braulio Pedoy. *Doce Pares Eskrima - Originally encompassed 12 styles and was founded by the Saavedra and Ca√±ete families in 1932. There are now several Doce Pares groups headed by various members of the Ca√±ete family. *Eskrido - Founded by Ciriaco \\"Cacoy\\" Ca√±ete, the last remaining founder of Doce Pares Eskrima. *Garimot Arnis - Led by Gat Puno Abon \\"Garimot\\" Baet. *Kalis Ilustrisimo - Founded by Antonio \\"Tatang\\" Ilustrisimo; important as the ancestor of many current eskrima systems. Some senior students are Antonio \\"Tony\\" Diego, Epifanio \\"Yuli\\" Romo, Christopher \\"Topher\\" Ricketts, Rey Galang and Romeo Macapagal * Jose Rizal practiced Arnis de Mano from Laguna * Kombatan - founded by Ernesto Presas, brother of Remy Presas. * Lameco Eskrima - Founded by Edgar Sulite.

Lightning Scientific Arnis is a system that revolves around the concept of Tercia Serrada Cadenilla y Espada y Daga which is a method of intercepting and redirecting attacks and blind-siding the opponent by going to the off-side and blanketing him with a barrage of continuous strikes. * Modern Arnis - Founded by Remy Presas, which has roots in the Presas family and Balintawak system. It is revolutionary for having pioneered a system that made teaching of Arnis easier for students as old-school systems were often very painful for the student, thus making it hard to attract students and keep the arts alive. * Pekiti Tirsia Kali - Founded by Conrado Tortal and carried on by Leo Tortal Gaje, inheritor of the family system of the Tortal clan. The name means \\"to cut into pieces at close range\\", although it includes techniques for all ranges. One of the most recognized blade-oriented systems.

Filipino-American Systems/Practitioners * Arnis Balite - founded by Pundador Manuel Aguillon in Zambales, currently carried on by Punong Guro Steven K. Dowd, publisher of FMA Informative. Aside from practicing Arnis, Aguillon was a boxer who was said to move so fast that he was nicknamed \\"Kid Balite\\", after the Balete tree which is said to be the dwelling place of ghosts and spirits in Philippine folklore. * Bahala Na Escrima - Founded by Leo Giron, named after The Bahala Na (Come what may) Intelligence Company which he was a part of in World War II. Giron and his company were the eyes and ears of Gen. Douglas MacArthur and were infiltrated into the island of Luzon where they fought hand-to-hand against katana- wielding Japanese troops. * Burton Richardson * Cabales Serrada Escrima - brought to Stockton, California by Angel Cabales * Dog Brothers - a group notorious for their Gatherings, which feature full-contact stick fighting and minimal protection. * Floro Villabrile * Inosanto Kali - developed by Dan Inosanto from various other styles; he does not call it a system in its own right, but rather a blend of systems from John Lacoste and others. * Integrated Eskrima - Integrated Eskrima is a pan-Philippine method of Filipino weapon training as developed and taught by Dr. Mark V Wiley. As a master practitioner of several systems of Eskrima and Arnis, Dr. Mark studied under the direction of the legendary masters Angel Cabales, Herminio Binas, Antonio Ilustrisimo, Benjamin Luna Lema, Ramiro Estalilla, Remy Presas, and Florendo Visitacion. * Juanito \\"Johnny\\" LaCoste * Ben Largusa *Latigo y Daga - Whip and dagger method founded by Tom Meadows. * Brandon Lee - age eight, Dan Inosanto started training the film actor.

The fire started on June 17, 2015 and burned over 31,359 acres before it was fully contained on July 21, 2015. The fire was first reported at 4 p.m. on June 17, 2015 just South of Big Bear Lake in San Bernardino County, and grew extremely quickly in the surrounding densely wooded mountain areas at an elevation of between 6,000 to 9,000 feet. At around 1,500 acres Aerial firefighting operations had begun including approximately eight tankers and a DC-10 Air Tanker from Medford, Oregon loaded with 11,600 gallons of Fire retardant. But due to heavy smoke, aerial operations were having trouble seeing the blaze but estimated that if left unrestrained, the area it could burn in two days could exceed 50,000 acres. With the help of firefighting and fire prevention efforts the actual two day fire progress reached about 15,000 acres. An additional two tankers had been brought in to help combat the fire, but were soon grounded along with the others due to there not being enough firefighters on the ground to take advantage of the retardant. Under the Command Incident Commander Norm Walker, over 1,900 firefighters fought tirelessly against the blaze aided by aerial operations. On June 24th a hobby drone Quadcopter flying in the area forced air operations to shut down immediately as a collision between the drone and aircraft could be fatal to those onboard. United States Forest Service Aviation Officer Mike Eaton said a tactical group supervisor flying an aircraft at 11,500 feet spotted the drone flying between his plane and another firefighting plane flying at 10,500 feet. Eaton said the presence of the drone kept firefighters from delivering 5,000 gallons of fire retardant on the flames and shut down subsequent missions that could have contained a part of the fire. Later that day, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department initiated a mandatory evacuation for the Burns Canyon and Rimrock areas. More evacuations soon followed as the burn area reached approximately 30,000 acres, and included areas along Hwy 38 east of Angelus Oaks, Barton Flats, Seven Oaks, South Fork, Heart Bar and Rainbow Lane. As of June 26th firefighting resources on scene included: 153 Fire engines, 4 air tankers (including one DC-10), 18 helicopters, 4 support fixed wing planes, 54 handcrews, 18 Water Tenders, 8 Bulldozers, and 2,116 personnel. Around this time the containment fell from 27% to 19%. As July 2nd rolled around, the majority of the fire had reached a containment level of 70% and the U.S. Forest Service reduced the personnel deployed to fight the blaze to just more than 1,400, down from nearly 2,300 personnel assigned to the fire just a few days before. By July 13, 2019 fire investigations had determined that human activity - likely arson- was the cause of the blaze that destroyed at least 4 buildings and over 30,000 acres. On July 21 the fire was fully contained and while there were no fatalities or serious injuries, 6 minor injuries were reported during the battle with the inferno. The operation to control the blaze cost $39.9 million.

Need for a Non-Pairwise Additive Theory  The van der Waals force between two molecules, in this context, is the sum of the attractive or repulsive forces between them; these forces are primarily electrostatic in nature, and in their simplest form might consist of a force between two charges, two dipoles, or between a charge and a dipole. Thus, the strength of the force may often depend on the net charge, electric dipole moment, or the electric polarizability (alpha) (see for example London force) of the molecules, with highly polarizable molecules contributing to stronger forces, and so on. The total force between two bodies, each consisting of many molecules in the van der Waals theory is simply the sum of the intermolecular van der Waals forces, where pairwise additivity is assumed. That is to say, the forces are summed as though each pair of molecules interacts completely independently of their surroundings (See Van der Waals forces between Macroscopic Objects for an example of such a treatment). This assumption is usually correct for gasses, but presents a problem for many condensed materials, as it is known that the molecular interactions may depend strongly on their environment and neighbors. For example, in a conductor, a point-like charge might be screened by the electrons in the conductance band, and the polarizability of a condensed material may be vastly different from that of an individual molecule. In order to correctly predict the van der Waals forces of condensed materials, a theory that takes into account their total electrostatic response is needed.  General Principle  The problem of pairwise additivity is completely avoided in the Lifshitz theory, where the molecular structure is ignored and the bodies are treated as continuous media. The forces between the bodies are now derived in terms of their bulk properties, such as dielectric constant and refractive index, which already contain all the necessary information from the original molecular structure. The original Lifshitz 1955 paper proposed this method relying on quantum field theory principles, and is, in essence, a generalization of the Casimir effect, from two parallel, flat, ideally conducting surfaces, to two surfaces of any material. Later papers by Langbein, Ninham, Parsegian and Van Kampen showed that the essential equations could be derived using much simpler theoretical techniques, an example of which is presented here.  Hamaker Constant in the Lifshitz Theory  An Ion of charge Q and a nonpolar molecule of polarizability alpha. The Lifshitz theory can be expressed as an effective Hamaker constant in the van der Waals theory. Consider, for example, the interaction between an ion of charge Q, and a nonpolar molecule with polarizability alpha_2 at distance r. In a medium with dielectric constant epsilon_3, the interaction energy between a charge and an electric dipole p is given by :U(r)=frac{-Qp}{4 pi epsilon_0 epsilon_3 r^2} with the dipole moment of the polarizable molecule given by p=alpha_2 E, where E is the strength of the electric field at distance r from the ion. According to Coulomb's law: :E = frac{Q}{4 pi epsilon_0 epsilon_3} frac{1}{r^2} so we may write the interaction energy as :U(r)=frac{-Q^2 alpha_2}{(4 pi epsilon_0 epsilon_3)^2 r^4} The nonpolar molecule is now replaced with a dielectric medium (in grey); the force experienced by the molecule can be found using the method of image charges. Definition of integration variables x and z. Consider now, how the interaction energy will change if the right hand molecule is replaced with a medium of density rho_2 of such molecules. According to the \\"classical\\" van der Waals theory, the total force will simply be the summation over individual molecules. Integrating over the volume of the medium (see the third figure), we might expect the total interaction energy with the charge to be :begin{align} U(D)&= frac{-2pi Q^2 alpha_2 rho_2}{(4 pi epsilon_0 epsilon_3)^2} int limits_{z=D}^{infin}dzintlimits_{x=0}^{infin}dx frac{x}{(z^2+x^2)^2}  & = -frac{pi Q^2 alpha_2 rho_2}{(4pi epsilon_0 epsilon_3)^2} frac{1}{D} end{align} But this result cannot be correct, since It is well known that a charge Q in a medium of dielectric constant epsilon_3 at a distance D from the plane surface of a second medium of dielectric constant epsilon_2 experiences a force as if there were an 'image' charge of strength Q'=-Q(epsilon_2-epsilon_3)/(epsilon_2+epsilon_3) at distance D on the other side of the boundary. The force between the real and image charges must then be :F(D)= frac{-Q^2}{(4pi epsilon_0 epsilon_3) (2D)^2} frac{epsilon_2-epsilon_3}{epsilon_2+epsilon_3} and the energy, therefore :U(D) = frac{-Q^2}{(4pi epsilon_0 epsilon_3) 4D} frac{epsilon_2-epsilon_3}{epsilon_2+epsilon_3} Equating the two expressions for the energy, we define a new effective polarizability that must obey :rho_2 alpha_2 = epsilon_0 epsilon_3 frac{epsilon_2-epsilon_3}{epsilon_2+epsilon_3} Similarly, replacing the real charge Q with a medium of density rho_1 and polarizability alpha_1 gives an expression for alpha_1 rho_1. Using these two relations, we may restate our theory in terms of an effective Hamaker constant. Specifically, using McLachlan's generalized theory of VDW forces the Hamaker constant for an interaction potential of the form U(r)=-C/r^n between two bodies at temperature T is :A = pi^2 C rho_1 rho_2 = frac{6pi^2 k_B T rho_1 rho_2}{(4pi epsilon_0)^2} sum_{n=0,1...}^infty frac{alpha_1 (i u_n) alpha_2 (i u_n)}{epsilon_3^2} with u_n = 2pi n k_B T / h, where k_B and h are Boltzmann's and Planck's constants correspondingly. Inserting our relations for rho alpha and approximating the sum as an integral k_B T sum_{n=0,1...}^infty rightarrow frac{h}{2pi}intlimits_{ u_1}^{infin}d u, the effective Hamaker constant in the Lifshitz theory may be approximated as :A approx frac{3}{4} k_B T left( frac{epsilon_1-epsilon_3}{epsilon_1+epsilon_3} right) left( frac{epsilon_2-epsilon_3}{epsilon_2+epsilon_3} right) + frac{3h}{4pi} intlimits_{ u_1}^{infin} d u left( frac{epsilon_1(i u)-epsilon_3(i u)}{epsilon_1(i u)+epsilon_3(i u)} right) left( frac{epsilon_2(i u)-epsilon_3(i u)}{epsilon_2(i u)+epsilon_3(i u)} right) We note that epsilon(i u) are real functions, and are related to measurable properties of the medium; thus, the Hamaker constant in the Lifshitz theory can be expressed in terms of observable properties of the physical system.  Experimental Validation  The macroscopic theory of van der Waals theory has many experimental validations. Among which, some of the most notable ones are Derjaguin (1960); Derjaguin, Abrikosova and Lifshitz (1956) and Israelachvili and Tabor (1973), who measured the balance of forces between macroscopic bodies of glass, or glass and mica; Haydon and Taylor (1968), who measured the forces across bilayers by measuring their contact angle; and lastly Shih and Parsegian (1975), who investigated Van der Waals potentials between heavy alkali-metal atoms and gold surfaces using atomic- beam-deflection.

Black mottling on the dorsal side is also present in smaller rockfish of less than 40 cm. The head has three distinct dark bands. The lateral line sports a thin pink-red line down its length. The peritoneum is silver with black dots. The lower jaw is long and has a moderate to small symphyseal knob. Individuals have thirteen dorsal and three anal spines. The mean weight of yellowmouth rockfish is 1.467 kg. Yellowmouth rockfish have been known to live up to 99 years, and reach a maximum length of 54 to 60 cm.Sebastes viviparous reproduction Distribution and habitat Yellowmouth rockfish are an east Pacific saltwater species that range from the Gulf of Alaska to San Francisco, California, and are commonly found from southeast Alaska to Oregon. Yellowmouth rockfish are widely distributed along the west coast of Canada, with highest densities in Queen Charlotte Sound. Yellowmouth rockfish are estimated to inhabit 11,000 to 34,000 of the estimated 48,000 square kilometers of potential habitat available to them in Canada. Yellowmouth rockfish occur along the continental slope at depths of 100 to 431 meters, with a preferred range of 180 to 275 meters. Juvenile yellowmouth rockfish are pelagic whereas adult yellowmouth rockfish are benthic and are frequently found inhabiting hard substrates such as bedrock and gravel. Biology Yellowmouth rockfish are viviparous. In British Columbia, fertilization events occur in February and females bear live young from early spring through June. Immature yellowmouth rockfish are pelagic for up to one year. During the pelagic stage, immature yellowmouth rockfish larvae mature into juveniles, and then into adults. Juvenile yellowmouth rockfish are vulnerable to predation by other fish, such as Pacific Hake and Chinook Salmon, as well as by seabirds. Once they reach adulthood, yellowmouth rockfish become benthic and settle on rocky substrates along the ocean floor. Yellowmouth rockfish achieve 50% maturation when the average lengths of females and males average 38 and 37 cm, respectively. On average, it takes them 10 years to reach these lengths. Yellowmouth rockfish are slow-growing, and have a generation time of 30 years. Interspecific interactions Yellowmouth rockfish are social, and are typically found in multispecies complexes. In British Columbia, yellowmouth rockfish are frequently caught along with Pacific Ocean perch, arrowtooth flounder, and redstripe rockfish. Deepwater uellowmouth rockfish assemblages along the west coast of the US and the Gulf of Alaska typically consist of a variety of rockfish species, including chilipepper and darkblotched rockfish. Commercial importance Yellowmouth rockfish support the third largest rockfish fishery in British Columbia, after Pacific Ocean perch and yellowtail rockfish, with an annual total allowable catch of 2,444 t. From 2007 to 2008, the total Canadian catch of yellowmouth rockfish was valued at $1.5 million. Bottom and midwater trawlers are the preferential method used to catch this species. Threats The primary threat to yellowmouth rockfish is commercial fishing. Bottom trawling is the preferred method of catching yellowmouth rockfish along the continental slope in British Columbia, and very little of this area receives habitat protection. In 2006, the Seafood Watch Program of Monterey Bay Aquarium classified all slope rockfish as high conservation concern and inherently vulnerable. In 2010, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada officially declared yellowmouth rockfish along the Pacific coast of Canada as threatened. Rockfish traits of slow growth, delayed maturity, and longevity make them vulnerable to overfishing, habitat loss from bottom trawling, and environmental change. Yellowmouth rockfish are susceptible to infection by common marine fish pathogens.Heidel, Jerry R., et al. ‚ÄúVisceral Nodular Cartilaginous Metaplasia in Rockfishes (Sebastes Spp.) in the Eastern North Pacific Ocean.‚Äù Journal of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation, vol. 14, no. 6, Jan. 2002, pp. 495‚Äì497. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/104063870201400608 Out of the yellowmouth rockfish surveyed for pathogens off of the coast of Oregon in 2001, 10% were found to be infected with Ichthyophonus and 2% with Mycobacterium. The spleens and kidneys of rockfish infected with these pathogens contained multiple, discrete nodules of cartilaginous metaplasia. Like other rockfish, yellowmouth rockfish have swim bladders that are unable to adjust to rapid pressure changes. Consequently, yellowmouth rockfish are extremely vulnerable to injury when caught from deep water, and bycatch mortality for most rockfish species is close to 100%.

Alonso Sordo Noriega, who would go on to found XEX-AM, was the first host of the program.RTC: History of La Hora Nacional The vision of the hour-long program was to create a link between the federal government with Mexican society and foster national formation. La Hora Nacional emerged during a decade when the Mexican government under L√°zaro C√°rdenas further entered the medium of broadcasting. Programming on La Hora Nacional has varied widely throughout its history, including classical music, popular music and live remotes from various locations in Mexico; it has also tended to change significantly in accord with larger political changes. In the 1950s, La Hora Nacional emphasized Mexican music and dedicated entire programs to different Mexican states. In the 1960s, La Hora Nacional became more of a radio magazine program, with dramatizations of historical events. Later decades would add cultural and sport sections, poetry, interviews, and segments that summarized the activities of the President of Mexico. For 30 years, La Hora Nacional was broadcast live. On July 26, 1987, La Hora Nacional celebrated its 50th anniversary with a radical change in format. Previously the entire hour program was originated from the RTC in Mexico City. However, from 1987 onward, the second half of the program would be produced by each of the states and broadcast within each state. Currently, 29 of the 32 Mexican federative entities produce their own half-hours; stations in Baja California Sur, Campeche and Tabasco air a second \\"complementary\\" half-hour produced by the RTC, as those states do not originate opt-outs. The name of the program has changed throughout its history. At one point, it was known as the Army-Navy Hour; at another, it was the Weekly National Magazine.Sinton√≠a Libre, Radio Educaci√≥n: Historia de La Hora Nacional See also *A Voz do Brasil, a similar program in Brazil References External links * Mexican radio programs 1937 establishments in Mexico ","title":"La Hora Nacional"},{"id":"47074929","text":"Rampur is a small yet prosperous and economically developing village in the Samastipur district in the Indian state of Bihar.

From 1851 to 1875 he was actor-manager in Edinburgh, where notable plays of the day were performed and where Henry Irving's early career took place. Early career Wyndham was born in Dublin in 1814. He made his first stage appearance in Salisbury in 1836, paying the theatre manager so he could play the long-studied role of Norval in Douglas. Six years later he played Romeo at Birmingham to the Juliet of Ellen Tree, and subsequently was seen at the Tuileries Garden before Louis Philippe I as Colonel Freelove in A Day after the Wedding. During 1844 he appeared at the Adelphi, Glasgow, and next year he fulfilled his ambition of making a prominent debut at Edinburgh (filling the place vacated by Leigh Murray who moved to London): he appeared as Sir Thomas Clifford in The Hunchback by Sheridan Knowles to the Julia of Helen Faucit at the Theatre Royal, and made a favourable impression. Among the parts allotted to him during the ensuing season were Mercutio, Charles Surface in The School for Scandal, and Rashleigh Osbaldistone in Rob Roy by William Henry Murray. In 1846 he married Rose, daughter of minor actor William Saker and sister of Edward Saker. She developed a special aptitude for training juvenile troupes in ballet and pantomime. In May 1849 Wyndham appeared at the Adelphi Theatre, Edinburgh, as Orlando, and in 1850 he was Brycefield in Marston's Strathmore. Manager of the Adelphi, Edinburgh On 27 December 1851 Wyndham opened the Adelphi as actor-manager, in succession to William Henry Murray, with The School for Scandal, playing Charles Surface, and following the comedy up with Gulliver, arranged as a pantomime, for which Mrs. Wyndham trained the children. The task of succeeding so successful a manager as Murray was an arduous one. Wyndham had to be leading comedian, acting manager, and stage manager in one; also a transition period was at hand which witnessed the increasing demand in Edinburgh for the theatrical \\"stars\\" of London, and the increased facilities afforded for touring companies by the railway. For the first ten years of Wyndham's management, however, the old system that had prevailed under Murray was little affected. In February 1852 Wyndham produced Macbeth with scenery that was thought to surpass any yet seen upon the Edinburgh stage; in May he was seen as Claude Melnotte in The Lady of Lyons for his wife's benefit; in June he was Robert in Robert the Bruce; in August Rashleigh Osbaldistone; and in October, for his benefit, Henry, prince of Wales, in Henry IV. The Royal The Adelphi was destroyed by fire on 24 May 1853. Fortunately for Wyndham, who was insured, but could not afford a holiday, the Royal Theatre was lying vacant. He promptly leased it, and opened on 11 June, in the part of Charles Bromley in Simpson & Co., which he followed up by Captain Absolute in The Rivals. The Adelphi, now renamed The Queen's, was reconstructed during 1854‚Äì5, and Wyndham for a time managed both theatres concurrently, but the Royal remained his headquarters until it was taken down in 1859. John Lawrence Toole was one of Wyndham's first stars at his new house, appearing at the Royal on 9 July 1853 in Dead Shot. Henry Irving, fresh from his debut at Sunderland, made his first appearance as a member of Wyndham's company on 9 Feb. 1857 as Gaston, duke of Orleans, in Richelieu. Henry Irving remained with the Wyndhams as \\"juvenile lead\\" until September 1859. In November 1856 Wyndham was Rolando in Tobin's The Honey Moon; in May 1857 he revived Macbeth, with Mrs. Wyndham as Lady Macbeth and Irving as Banquo; in December of that year they were successful with the pantomime Little Bo Peep, with Irving as \\"Scruncher, captain of the Wolves\\". A final performance at the Royal, doomed to destruction in order to make way for a post-office, took place on 25 May 1859, when Wyndham played Sir Charles Pomander in Masks and Faces; Mrs. Wyndham played Peg, and Irving played Soaper. The Queen's Wyndham now returned to the Queen's (the old Adelphi). He opened his first season there under royal letters patent on 25 June 1859, as Felix Featherley in Everybody's Friend. This was followed in July by The Heart of Midlothian, in which Montagu Williams and F. C. Burnand appeared as \\"distinguished amateurs\\"; and then London Assurance, with Williams as Charles Courtly, Irving as Dazzle, and Mrs. Wyndham as Lady Gay Spanker. In June 1860 Wyndham was Rory in Rory O'More, in June 1861 he played Myles in The Colleen Bawn, and in February 1862 Salem Scudder in The Octoroon. The Queen's was burnt down on 13 January 1865 during the run of the Christmas pantomime, Little Tom Tucker. It was rebuilt and reopened as The Royal on 2 December 1865, in time for the next yearly pantomime, Robin Hood. A handsome presentation was made by the citizens of Edinburgh to Wyndham for his services to the drama in 1869. In 1871 he revived a number of Waverley dramas upon the occasion of the Scott centenary; but the star system was already in the ascendant, and this form of entertainment showed a diminished success. On 6 February 1875, during a run of Jack and the Beanstalk (in which A. W. Pinero was one of the performers), the Royal shared the fate of its predecessors, the Queen's and the Adelphi, the theatre upon this site being burned down for the third time under Wyndham's management. Wyndham made his last appearance upon the Edinburgh stage on the opening night of the new Edinburgh Theatre, Castle Terrace, on 20 December 1875. As an actor, he was versatile, but is said to have excelled in light comedy and in Irish gentlemen. A year later he retired from his long and, upon the whole, successful management. Retirement He left Edinburgh and settled in Sloane Street, London, where he renewed relations, under altered circumstances, with Henry Irving. He became a familiar figure at the Garrick Club, and is described as one of the youngest- looking men of his age. Wyndham died at his home aged 80, on 16 December 1894, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery on 20 December. By his wife he had two daughters and one son. Frederick W. P. Wyndham (1853‚Äì1930), his son, began as an actor and later, with John B. Howard (1841‚Äì1895) managed several theatres; in 1895 they formed the theatre management company Howard & Wyndham Ltd.Howard and Wyndham Limited 1888 - 1948 its-behind-you.com, accessed 20 July 2015.

Life Saker was born in Bethnal Green in London, son of William Saker, a well-known low comedian at London minor theatres and later a tobacconist and news-vendor. Edward's elder brother Horatio Saker (1824‚Äì1861) also became an actor. He was placed with a firm of architects, but early showed a strong taste for a theatrical career, which he adopted when about twenty-five years of age. Edward Saker and Lionel Brough in Box and Cox, caricatured in 1883 In 1857 he joined a theatre company in Edinburgh, then under the management of Robert Henry Wyndham, his brother-in-law. He learnt his profession here, and soon became a useful member of the company; he was also treasurer of the company for several years. He made a tour in Scotland with Henry Irving, when the latter played Robert Macaire (in Charles Selby's play of that name) to Saker's Jacques Strop. With Lionel Brough he also gave an entertainment, under the name of The So-Amuse Twins. He first attempted management during a summer season in 1862, when he rented the Edinburgh Royal from Wyndham, and opened with The Lady of the Lake. In 1865 he moved to Liverpool, and after two years there as an actor he became manager of the Alexandra Theatre in December 1867, and remained as manager until his death on 29 March 1883. On 16 February 1874 he married Emily O'Brien (1847‚Äì1912), an actress who had joined the company of the Alexandra Theatre in 1872. Her stage name was Marie O'Berne, and she was known as a comedian. After their marriage, they first appeared together at the Alexandra in Thomas Morton's farce A Roland for an Oliver, opening on 2 March 1874. As an actor Saker was most successful in parts requiring drollery and facial expression. His Shakespearean clowns were notable examples of low-comedy acting. However, he made his chief reputation as a manager. His period of management at the Alexandra, Liverpool, was rendered notable by a series of revivals of Shakespearean plays, including The Winter's Tale, Much Ado about Nothing, A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Comedy of Errors In all his undertakings he was ably assisted by his wife, who survived him.

He is one of only 147 Master Sommeliers in North America, as of June 2015, and is the founder of the Orange County, CA-based Neptune School of Wine. He appeared on and off Broadway in 1984-85, appeared in numerous television movies and series from 1988-90, and appeared as himself in the 2013 wine documentary SOMM. Life and career  Neptune was born in Newport Beach, California on July 10, 1956. He started learning about wine and food while working at a Laguna Beach, CA restaurant called Tivoli Terrace, owned by his mother June. Acting career In 1979, Neptune moved to NY City to become a theater actor. He studied acting with Wynn Handman at The American Place Theatre. He was a featured actor in playwright Cynthia Heimel's play A Girls Guide to Chaos, and also originated the role of Jeff Barry in the 1984 Off-Broadway production of Leader of the Pack, appearing in the 1985 Broadway production as well. He also appeared in a variety of television productions. He filmed a number of programs in NY and also commuted back to LA. Programs included the television action film C.A.T. Squad: Python Wolf (1988), the television biopic Rock Hudson (1990), as well as guest appearances in television series such as L.A. Law (1988), Tour of Duty (1988), Hardball (1989) and Life Goes On (1989). He also made a guest appearance as Crewman Aron on Star Trek: The Next Generation, in the second season episode The Dauphin (1989). While pursuing acting opportunities, he supplanted his income by working in restaurants. He convinced the manager of a high-end restaurant to allow him to manage the wine program, even though he had relatively little experience with wine. In 1989, after ten years working in various productions while also working as a sommelier in restaurants, he returned to Orange County, California. Soon after moving back, he was up for a leading role in a television series, but when he didn't get the part after multiple callbacks, decided to forgo his acting career and devote himself full time to wine. Wine sales and education In the mid-'90s, starting out as a wine salesman, he became more educated about wine, and realized that he could be as good if not better than many of the experts. He traveled to NY to take his first wine exam, and after failing, studied intently and eventually passed. He joined Benicia, CA-based Henry Wine group and eventually became their Senior Vice President of Corporate Training, training and educating fellow employees as well as retail customers about wine. Neptune School of Wine In 2003, Neptune launched the Neptune School of Wine, the first school in Southern California dedicated to teaching the wine curriculum established by London-based Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET), considered the world's foremost wine education group.J. Robinson (ed), The Oxford Companion to Wine, Third Edition, p. 769, Oxford University Press 2006, The school administers WSET wine education programs, as well as the French Wine Scholar program and exam offered by the Washington, DC-based French Wine Society. Master Sommelier In 2005, Neptune passed the notoriously difficult Master Sommelier exam, becoming one of 229 certified Master Sommeliers worldwide, as of June 2015. He was the first person in decades to pass the exam while living in Southern California. As of June 2015, he was one of the teaching Masters at the Court of Master Sommelier Intro and Advanced Courses, and was an examiner at the Certified, Advanced, and Master Sommelier Examinations. SOMM It was through Neptune's participation as a Master Sommelier examiner that he met director Jason Wise, who with Neptune's help was given permission to film part of the Master Sommelier examination for SOMM, a 2013 documentary following four candidates through the process. Wise featured Neptune in the documentary, playing himself, along with fellow Master Sommeliers Michael Jordan, Fred Dame and Geoff Kruth. Neptune was recognized for the passion and enthusiasm he showed for wine while giving his filmed interviews. Additional wine credentials In addition to his Master Sommelier Diploma, Neptune holds the title of Certified Wine Educator (CWE) with the Society of Wine Educators, has a diploma in Wine and Spirits from the London-based Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET), is recognized as an Associate of the Institute of Wines and Spirits (AIWS), a title bestowed upon wine experts who complete WSET's diploma, and holds the credential French Wine Scholar, with Highest Honors. Wine consulting As a certified Master Sommelier, Neptune acts as a wine program consultant for a variety of hotels and restaurants nationwide, including Fairmont Hotels and Resorts' properties the Fairmont San Francisco and the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, as well as the Terranea Resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, CA, and the restaurant One Pico at the Shutters Hotel in Santa Monica, CA, where LA Times restaurant critic S.

Rigas in person, during his interrogation by the Austrian authorities after his arrest, claimed that he published the Maps purely for commercial reasons, and the authorities accepted his claim.Karamberopoulos, D.

The addition of the portrait of the ruler of Wallachia, the votive inscription and the indication ‚Äúto the Greeks and philhellenes‚Äù allow us to think that the Map was created on demand of Alexander Ypsilantis. Through the position he held, Alexander Ypsilantis contributed to the awakening of the Greeks, in book publishing and dissemination of literature. Furthermore the symbolic representations accompanying the Map have led to the conclusion that the publishing of the Map is part of the ideological context of Rigas Velestinlis for the formation of a creative and liberal state in the Balkans which would be called the Greek Republic and would include all Christian Ottoman conquered lands. The Map of Moldova and the New Map of Wallachia were not released in the Danubian Principalities since shortly after their release, Rigas was arrested and all copies were confiscated, making them unique and very hard to find today.

Ingalba Nature Reserve is situated 10 kilometres west of Temora and Pucawan Nature Reserve a further 6 km west. Big Bush Nature Reserve is 15 kilometres northwest of Temora. All three reserves are located within Temora Shire. They are managed concurrently by the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service. The reserves are linked by corridors of vegetation in adjacent private land and along roads and Travelling Stock Routes.http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/parks/ingalbaNrPom.pdf History Ingalba Ingalba Nature Reserve (4013.5 ha) lies 10 kilometres west of Temora on the Burley Griffin Way, and was gazetted in three stages. On 17 July 1970, 3,440.5 ha. of the former Temora State Forest was gazetted, and further additions followed. On 1 October 1976 (16.19 ha) of the former Trigonometrical Reserve at Wharrun Trig was adjoined to Ingalba, and on 7 January 1983 additional amounts (556.8 ha) were added following the acquisition of private land. Ingalba Nature Reserve is intersected by and excludes the Burley Griffin Way (Griffith‚Äì Temora Road) and an easement through the southern part of the reserve east from Kellows Lane. Pucawan Pucawan Nature Reserve (274 ha) is a further 6 km west on the Coolamon Road, and was gazetted on 11 March 1988. Prior to gazettal the area was vacant Crown land, part of which was proclaimed as a Rifle Range. Big Bush Big Bush Nature Reserve (640 ha) is 15 km north-west of Temora on Thanowring Road, 7 km north of Ingalba Nature Reserve, and was gazetted in four stages. On 23 November 1984 the 42.09 ha. of Crown land gazetted as a Native Flora and Fauna Reserve was revoked and proclaimed as Big Bush Nature Reserve. Adjoining private land was purchased and gazetted on 31 January 1986 (67.68 ha.), 30 October 1987 (98.63 ha.) and on 1 October 1999 (431.53 ha.). Geology The reserves consist of flat to gently undulating terrain at a slight elevation above the surrounding land. Ingalba Nature Reserve has the most varied topography, containing small drainage lines, and with elevations from 315m to 402m at Mt Wharrun. The other reserves are of slightly lower altitude. The landscape is characterised by a complex system of sedimentary, volcanic and igneous rocks of the Lachlan Fold Belt. Pucawan Nature Reserve and the southern part of Ingalba Nature Reserve have an Upper Ordovician geology of quartzite, shale, slate, phyllite and schist. There is an indistinct boundary with the Upper Silurian geology predominant in Big Bush and Ingalba Nature Reserves. These areas consist of sandstone, shale, siltstone, slate, conglomerate and limestone, with some volcanics. Abundant but poorly preserved fossil graptolites are found in a disused quarry in Pucawan Nature Reserve. These fossils (an extinct group of oceanic colonial organisms) have been dated from the late Ordovician period. The soils are of intermediate loamy texture. Crest soils are mostly shallow, with broken shales and siltstone present on the surface. On the gentle slopes and flats, deposition of alluvial materials has produced deeper, dark brown soils. The surrounding cleared land supports rich crops on red-brown earths and red earth soils. Minor erosion is present in gullies. Biology Flora Two distinct vegetation communities occur on the reserves: tall open woodland and low open woodland with dry heath. These communities are considered regionally significant due to their remnant status. The tall woodland vegetation is dominated by mugga ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon) and western grey box (Eucalyptus microcarpa). It also supports white cypress pine (Callitris glaucophylla) on lower slopes, with black cypress pine (Callitris endlicheri) common on upper slopes and ridges. Shrubs include quandong (Santalum acuminatum), native cherry (Exocarpus cupressiformis), rough wattle (Acacia aspera), bent-leaf wattle (Acacia genistifolia), hakea wattle (Acacia hakeoides), and wedge-leaf hopbush (Dodonaea cuneata). The mugga ironbark - western grey box woodland community was considered to be inadequately conserved in NSW and vulnerable to further loss by Benson in 1989. As there has been little addition to the area conserved since that time, this is still the case. Dry heathland or low open woodland is found on ridgetops and exposed upper slopes. This community is characterised by Allocasuarina diminuta, with scattered scribbly gum (Eucalyptus rossii) and Dwyer‚Äôs mallee gum (Eucalyptus dwyeri). There is frequently a dense shrub layer with common species being heath myrtle (Calytrix tetragona), urn heath (Melichrus lanceolatus), daphne heath (Brachyloma daphnoides) and rusty spider flower (Grevillea floribunda). Big Bush Nature Reserve contains green mallee (Eucalyptus viridis). This mallee species has a restricted range in NSW and is poorly represented in conservation reserves. The reserves are three of only four reserves known to conserve Cootamundra wattle (Acacia baileyana) as an endemic species. Whilst no plant species listed under the Threatened Species Act 1995 or rare or threatened Australian plants have been recorded, twelve plant species are considered regionally significant due to limited distribution (Porteners 2001). =Introduced flora= Weed infestations are concentrated in areas of previous disturbance, particularly in past grazing areas, and along current agricultural boundaries. The reserves contain limited discrete patches of weeds including Paterson‚Äôs curse (Echium plantagineum) and horehound (Marrubium vulgare). Bridal creeper (Myrsiphyllum asparagoides) occurs along roadsides adjacent to Ingalba Nature Reserve. There have also been minor occurrences of bathurst burr (Xanthium spinosum), galvanised burr (Scerolaena birchii), saffron thistle (Carthamus lanatus) and of pasture species. Fauna The vegetation communities of the reserves provide a range of habitats for native fauna. Seventeen animal species listed under the Threatened Species Act 1995 have been recorded on the reserves. Known resident species include the Gilbert‚Äôs whistler (Pachycephala inornata), barking owl (Ninox connivens), superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii), turquoise parrot (Neophema pulchella) and diamond firetail (Stagonopleura guttata). A number of declining eastern woodland birds also occur, including the hooded robin (Melanodryas cucullata cucullata), grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis temporalis) and black-chinned honeyeater (Melithreptus gularis gularis). The painted honeyeater (Grantiella picta) is often present in spring. Autumn and winter flowering eucalypts, especially mugga ironbark, occasionally attract the endangered swift parrot (Lathamus discolor), and on rare occasions regent honeyeaters (Xanthomyza phrygia). Malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) were once present at Ingalba and Big Bush Nature Reserves, but individuals or active breeding mounds have not been observed for over twenty years and it is considered to be locally extinct. Seven amphibians, 12 reptiles, 16 mammals (including 8 species of bats) and 164 native bird species have been recorded from the reserves (NPWS Wildlife Atlas). The reserves are connected by narrow vegetation corridors allowing movement of some fauna species between the three areas. =Introduced fauna= Introduced animals occurring within the reserves include foxes, rabbits and cats. Feral goats and deer have been sighted occasionally in Ingalba Nature Reserve, but are not resident. The lack of permanent water sources in the reserves restricts the occupation of the reserve by feral animals. Human use Cultural heritage includes both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal history and associated activities and works. It comprises important sites, structures and relics that may have aesthetic, historic, scientific and social significance to present and future generations. The geology, landform, climate and plant and animal communities of the area, plus location, have determined use by humans. Main forms of past disturbance include clearing (especially in southern portions of Ingalba and Big Bush Nature Reserves), sheep grazing, and logging for fences and firewood. Mugga ironbark, grey box and white cypress pine have been extensively logged at Ingalba Nature Reserve. Regeneration since reservation has resulted in a progressive increase in vegetation density with significant tree and shrub regrowth. Ingalba Nature Reserve contains disturbed areas relating to its logging past, including historical rubbish piles, trails and cleared areas. Quarrying and fire have also shaped the landscape. Pucawan Nature Reserve was formerly used as a quarry site. There is a registered apiary site in Pucawan Nature Reserve. Truck stopping areas are located adjacent to Ingalba Nature Reserve on both sides of the Temora-Griffith Road. Aboriginal heritage Knowledge of past use is limited. Scarred trees and open campsites are the only registered sites known in the area. Sites are likely to have been widespread throughout the reserves, but the ground has been disturbed by past land use such as logging. On lands adjoining Ingalba Nature Reserve, scattered stone artefacts have been found. The reserves lie within the area occupied by the Wiradjuri people. Today Pucawan and Ingalba Nature Reserves lie within the area of the Narrandera Local Aboriginal Land Council, while Big Bush Nature Reserve is within the area of the Young Local Aboriginal Land Council. Historic sites All three reserves have previously had timber cut, especially Ingalba and Big Bush Nature Reserves. Timber was removed for many purposes, such as fencing posts, firewood, charcoal for farm forges, shed poles and railway sleepers. Today regrowth from tree stumps serve as reminders of this past use. Subsidiary material, such as tins and bottles, has been left behind from logging activities and these are scattered throughout Ingalba Nature Reserve. Both Ingalba and Pucawan Nature Reserves also served as a depository for rubbish dumping by many generations of neighbouring farmers. The Casuarina Track in Ingalba Nature Reserve is part of an old horse-drawn vehicle route between Temora and Mimosa Station. A stock route runs between the two sections of Big Bush Nature Reserve along Cedar Road, formerly called Campbell‚Äôs Stock Route. Two small peaks in Ingalba Nature Reserve, Northcote and Mt Wharrun, were used for Trigonomic surveying and state surveying markers remain in these points. Pucawan Nature Reserve was used as a rifle range in 1917, as a means to maintain rifle skills in the post-World War 1 period, and is still known locally as ‚Äòrifle butts hill‚Äô. A target mound, and shooting mounds at set distances from the target still remain. Ongoing management NSW Parks and Wildlife aims to preserve, conserve and enhance the parks through ensuring that human impact is managed appropriately. Key activities include weed and pest eradication and control, fire track management, road user management and enhancement of the public knowledge of the reserves. Given the proximity of privately owned, uncleared land (often neighbouring the reserves and in the case of Ingalba and Big Bush, linking them) there is a possibility that the size of the reserve could be increased through purchase or donation of the land to the NSW Parks and Wildlife Service.

He was a younger son of King Alexander V of Imereti, of the Bagrationi dynasty. He was a major supporter of his brother, Solomon I of Imereti, in his efforts to consolidate royal authority.  Career  Joseph was born in the family of Alexander V, King of Imereti in western Georgia, and his wife, Tamar Abashidze. He pursued a clerical career, mostly at the major cathedral of Gelati near Imereti's capital of Kutaisi, and rose through ranks from a protoiereus to a bishop. In 1766, he was a chief negotiator on behalf of his brother, King Solomon I, who had been driven out of his capital in an Ottoman-supported coup in favor of his cousin, Teimuraz of Imereti. To help Solomon recover his crown, Joseph, went to Tbilisi, to King Heraclius II of Kartli and Kakheti, and then, accompanied by Heraclius's envoy, traveled to Constantinople for the negotiations with the Ottoman government. In the meantime, Solomon was able to defeat Teimuraz and focused on his recalcitrant subject Rostom, Duke of Racha. Rostom dispatched his brother Besarion, Catholicos of Abkhazia and, hence, the head of an Orthodox church in western Georgia, to the Ottoman pasha in Akhaltsikhe to ask aid against Solomon. In a countermove, Solomon dispatched Joseph with the promise of peace in exchange for the arrest of Catholicos Besarion. Solomon‚Äôs diplomacy won and Besarion was cast in prison in Akhaltsikhe, but he escaped to the Principality of Mingrelia and declared himself \\"catholicos\\" of the local Orthodox church. In his place, Solomon appointed Joseph, then aged 30. He was crowned at Gelati in March 1769. In May 1769, Solomon sent Joseph to Racha to make peace with Rostom. The catholicos swore at the Barakoni Church that his brother king guaranteed security. Rostom agreed eagerly, but he was betrayed by Solomon, who had him captured during a banquet and had his eyes burned out. The duchy of Racha was abolished and its lands confiscated; some were granted to Joseph. In the years that followed, Joseph pushed for efforts to persuade the Mingrelian government to abolish the rival catholicate established by Rostom's fugitive brother Besarion. The negotiations were fruitless, but, after Besarion's death in 1773, no attempt was ever made to install a catholicos in Mingrelia. Catholicos Joseph spared no effort to aggrandize his cathedral at Gelati. A new wall was constructed around it; several new estates, serf households, precious liturgical items, and a collection of manuscripts, including the 13th-century Vani Gospels, were donated to it. Donations were also sent to the Bichvinta Cathedral, an erstwhile seat of the catholicoi of Abkhazia. Joseph died in 1776, at the age of 37. He was buried at the Gelati monastery.

After evolving toward a memorial site and a museum of the Bible and of Protestantism, the project was abandoned. In 2000, unable to participate in the creation of an actual museum on the history of Protestantism, the Foundation decided, with the Historical Society of French Protestantism, to set up a museum on the Internet: the Virtual Museum of French Protestantism, which seeks to share the specific characteristics of Protestants through the history of Protestantism. The museum site, which can be visited free of charge, opened in January 2003. It quickly attracted a wide audience, which increased with the offering of English and German versions of the site, thanks to the support of the √éle-de- France region and the Ministry of Culture. In 2014, the design and navigation of the site were completely revamped while preserving the existing content. Content The Virtual Museum of Protestantism offers over a thousand articles, classified into four headings, illustrated by 3,000 images. The articles are augmented with video clips, documents and bibliographic references and are accessible in French, English and German. The articles can also be organized into tours that group these articles by theme in a relevant order, similar to guided tours. On the home page, a time line illustrates the major dates of the history of Protestantism. The four main headings of the museum are the following: # History, # Key figures, # Themes, # Art ‚Äì Heritage. A few exhibits that have been presented by Protestant museums are also offered with specific articles. Since May 4, 2015, the Museum has offered an online tour for the class on the Protestant Reformation specially designed for French fifth form junior high school students with adapted educational articles containing numerous audio components, images, video clips and documents designed for teachers and a learning assessment questionnaire.

Fecal sludge is a mixture of human excreta, water and solid wastes (e.g. toilet paper or other anal cleansing materials, menstrual hygiene materials) that are disposed of in pits, tanks or vaults of onsite sanitation systems. Fecal sludge that is removed from septic tanks is called septage. FSM is necessary in densely populated areas where a proportion of the population is not connected to a sewerage network, and the covering and rebuilding of pit latrines is not possible. This is the case in most urban areas in developing countries, but such services are also used in developed countries where sewerage systems are unavailable. FSM services are usually provided by formal and informal private sector services providers, local governments, water authorities and utilities. However, in many developing countries FSM services are often unavailable, or if they are available are often informal, unregulated, unhygienic and unsafe. This can lead to surface water and groundwater pollution, the spreading of pathogens into the environment and adverse public health impacts. It can also result in unreliable services with relatively high costs to the households which need them. Fecal sludge collection services can be made available on a scheduled basis or on a call-for-service basis (also known as on-demand, on- request or non-scheduled services). The collected fecal sludge may be transported to treatment plants using a vacuum truck; a tank and pump mounted on a flatbed truck; a small tank pulled by a motorcycle; or in containers on a hand cart. Mobile or permanent transfer stations can be used to improve the efficiency of fecal sludge transportation by transferring the waste to larger tankers for haulage to treatment. The wider use of multiple decentralized sludge treatment facilities within cities (to avoid long haulage distances) is currently being researched and piloted. The collected fecal sludge should preferably be processed at dedicated fecal sludge treatment plants, instead of being co-treated with sewage in municipal sewage treatment plants, unless these plants are able to take the additional load, and facilities to separate liquids and solids are available.Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014). Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) book - Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation , Chapter 9. IWA Publishing, UK () A variety of mechanized and non-mechanized processing technologies may be used, including constructed wetlands, anaerobic digestion, and waste stabilization ponds. The treatment process can produce useful products such as treated effluent that can be used for irrigation. Another possibility is to use the treated fecal sludge after composting as a soil conditioner or for the production of biogas, charcoal, biodiesel, powdered industrial fuel and electricity. Historically, the term night soil was used for fecal sludge. Resource recovery from fecal sludge can also be for building materials, protein, animal fodder, and water for irrigation.

Vacuum truck to transport septage, Highland, Michigan Fecal sludge management (FSM) requires safe and hygienic septic tank and pit latrine emptying services, along with the effective treatment of solids and liquids and the reuse of treated produce where possible.Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014). Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) book - Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation . IWA Publishing, UK () It may include a range of options including on-site and offsite treatment, and the dispersal or capture and further processing of the products of the treatment process into such as biogas, compost and energy. FSM is used synonymously with the term \\"septage management\\", but they are not the same. Septage is a specific type of fecal sludge: it is the partially digested fecal solids that accumulates in septic tanks. Fecal sludge from pit latrines may have a lower water content compared to septage and may contain more solid waste. Pit latrines generate fecal sludge, and these are sometimes classified as dry toilets, although wet pits are also common, especially in Asia. However, other types of dry toilets - those that are designed to be easily emptied without the addition of water - do not generate fecal sludge but generate instead dried feces (in the case of urine-diverting dry toilets) or compost (in the case of composting toilets), for example. In the case of Arborloo toilets, nothing is ever extracted from the pit and, instead, the lightweight outhouse/superstructure is moved to another shallow hole and a tree is planted on top of the filled hole. Collectively, the collection, transport, treatment and reuse of excreta constitute the \\"value chain\\" of fecal sludge management. In India some government policy documents are using the term FSSM for \\"Fecal sludge and septage management\\".National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) and Urban Management Centre (UMC) (2018). Faecal Sludge and Septage Management: An Orientation Module. National Institute of Urban Affairs, New Delhi Septage Septage or \\"septic tank sludge\\" is partially treated sludge that is accumulated and stored in a septic tank or similar onsite sewage facility. Septage is a by-product from the pretreatment of household wastewater (sewage) in a septic tank. After a few years of accumulation, septage is usually pumped out of a septic tank by a vacuum truck. Septic tanks receive blackwater from flush toilets, as well as greywater. This means that septage only contains the kind of solid waste that can be flushed, such as toilet paper. Septage may also include \\"scum\\", which is material that floats at the top and contains fats, oil and grease as well as any floating solid waste. The term \\"septage\\" has been used in the United States since at least 1992.USAID (1992) Guide to Septage Treatment and Disposal, United States Environmental Protection Agency, USA It has also been used in projects by the United States Agency for International Development in Asia.AECOM International Development, Inc. and the Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (Sandec) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) (2010) A Rapid Assessment of Septage Management in Asia, Policies and Practies in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam Another definition of septage is: \\"A historical term to define sludge removed from septic tanks.\\"Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., L√ºthi, C., Reymond, Ph. and Zurbr√ºgg, C. (2014). Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies (2nd Revised Edition). Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland Septage waste is periodically removed (with a frequency depending on tank capacity, system efficiency, and usage level, but typically less often than annually) from the septic tanks by specialized vehicles known as vacuum trucks. They pump the septage out of the tank, and transport it to a local sewage treatment plant. It can also be used by farmers for fertilizer, or stored in large septage waste storage facilities for later treatment or use on crops. Background Lack of fecal sludge management: Discharge of fecal sludge into the environment in Burkina Faso Example of lacking fecal sludge management: Fecal sludge collected from pit latrines is dumped into a river at the Korogocho slum in Nairobi, Kenya Worldwide there is an increasing interest and awareness of FSM issues, particularly in Africa and Asia.Oxfam (2016).

WRC Report No. KV 340/15, prepared for the Sanitation Research Fund for Africa (SRFA) Project of the Water Research Commission (WRC), Pretoria, South Africa, This is evidenced by some large- scale research and development projects occurring in the area of FSM. Such research is being carried out and funded by several organizations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Chowdhry, S., Kon√©, D. (2012). Business Analysis of Fecal Sludge Management: Emptying and Transportation Services in Africa and Asia - Draft final report. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA In many developing countries, fecal sludge is not properly managed. This may be due to a lack of mandated institutions and low awareness of the impact of poor sanitation; a lack of technical expertise and experience; an inability to source funds for to purchase of vacuum trucks and treatment, as well as a lack of knowledge necessary to initiate and implement successful FSM programs. This can result in the poor performance of onsite sanitation facilities (OSSFs), septic tank and pit latrine overflows, the unsafe emptying of pit latrines, and the dumping of untreated pathogenic fecal sludge into the environment.WIN-SA (2011). What happens when the pit is full? - Developments in on-site faecal sludge management (FSM). Water Information Network South Africa  Purposes  Desludging using proper personal protective equipment in Dumaguete, Philippines Goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals for (water and) sanitation has helped to increase awareness of the risks of poor sanitation management along the entire sanitation chain. It has provided a motivation to many countries, cities and organizations to improve the range of improved sanitation services available. Among these are FSM programs designed to: * Improve the functioning of onsite sanitation systems and to reduce the potential for human contact with fecal-borne pathogens; * Minimize odors and nuisances, and the uncontrolled discharge of organic matter from overflowing tanks or pits; * Support the upgrading of onsite sanitation upgrading programs; * Safeguard public health against indiscriminate disposal of collected fecal sludge; * Derive agricultural products, including soil conditioner from composting or co-composting materials and energy products such as biogas, charcoal pellets, industrial powdered fuel etc. * Stimulate economic development, and job creation and livelihood opportunities, while addressing the issues of the social stigma and operator health and safety that continue to impact informal workers. FSM programs can be drivers of sanitation improvement in different ways. They can encourage OSSF upgrades that reduce (or increase) the frequency of desludging and therefore operational and environmental costs. They can also be drivers of economic development along the sanitation value chain. This can include the provision of materials and parts for new toilets and septic tanks. This can also include jobs for contractors and equipment installers; for sludge collection personal including drivers and emptiers; and for treatment and reuse systems operators. This can also include the production and sale of the end-products of the sludge treatment process. These products may include recycled water for agriculture and industry, soil conditioners, biogas, biodiesel or electricity. There are currently large numbers of pilot, demonstration and full-scale FSM programs operating in Asia and Africa, however to date few that have demonstrated a sustained impact upon the value chain.  Elements of successful programs  Desludging truck (vacuum truck) in action in Nepal FSM services can be provided as demand based (often called on-request, on-call, on-demand, ad-hoc or non-scheduled) or scheduled (also known as regular) desludging, or a combination of both. Under either mechanism, OSSFs are desludged on a periodic basis or when the household requests it or due to inspection by a competent authority indicates desludging is needed. An analysis of 20 FSM Innovation Case Studies and research and advocacy of successful programs carried out by Oxfam Philippines has demonstrated that common elements for successful FSM programs include: * Well formulated and practical policy, rules and regulation: While these are essential they are almost useless, even counterproductive, on their own, and must be supported by complementary factors such as those below; * Local leadership and clearly mandated and resourced institutions to manage services, even where actual services are delivered by the private sector; * Partnerships between stakeholders contributes to developing services at scale, building community confidence and achieving sustainability; * A sustained program of community engagement, marketing and awareness raising is as essential to FSM as sludge treatment ‚Äì but is frequently under-valued, under-budgeted and sometimes abandoned after an initial period; * Capacity-building for FSM service providers helps ensure that they can effectively meet all segments of demand and achieve long-term viability. This may include training in both technical matters and business management, and the facilitation of capital formation through grants, equipment leasing, loan guarantees and other financial instruments; * Tariffs that are pro-poor and representative of operational costs for providing the service; * Technology that is appropriate to the capacity to operate and maintain the system and the realities of the value chain.  Characteristics of fecal sludge  Fecal sludge (FS) is the human waste, wastewater, trash and debris that accumulates in pit latrines and septic tanks or other onsite sanitation systems. Fecal sludge is an offensive material that contains pathogens, can generate odors and cause surface water pollution, as well as groundwater pollution. Characteristics of fecal sludge may vary widely due to climate, toilet type, diet and other variables. Performing a waste characterization study to understand local conditions provides data that factors into treatment plant sizing, as well as estimating the value of the products that can be derived from the treatment process. The main physico-chemical parameters commonly measured to characterize fecal sludge include: BOD, total suspended solids, % solids, indication of sand, COD, ammonium, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG), Sludge Volume Index (SVI), pH, alkalinity. System designers often use default values, such as 2,000 mg/l for BOD and 5,000 mg/l of TSS (which might be an average country-wide) in order to size the treatment system. If no such data exists, or if local conditions are not adequately reflected in assumed values, a waste characterization study can be conducted. Relatively little data exists on pathogen content in fecal sludge. One study from rural Bangladesh determined 41 helminth eggs per g of fecal sludge from pit latrines. The characteristics of fecal sludge may be influenced by: * Methods, techniques and the skill levels of personnel conducting the desludging; * The efficiency of the different types of equipment used in desludging; * Seasonality - presence of groundwater or flood water that may infiltrate into tanks and dilute the contents; * The last time the tank was desludged (age of fecal sludge). More research into conducting waste characterization studies in developing countries is needed. For developed countries, more data is available.Bilhimer, D. (2001) Washington State Septage Characterization Analysis, Washington State Department of Ecology, Solid Waste & Financial Assistance Program Current practice Sanitation workers Sanitation workers are the people responsible for cleaning, maintaining, operating, or emptying a sanitation technology at any step of the sanitation chain.World Bank, ILO, WaterAid, and WHO (2019). Health, Safety and Dignity of Sanitation Workers: An Initial Assessment. World Bank, Washington, DC. These workers contribute to safe fecal sludge management. Cities Fleet of vacuum trucks used for desludging services by Manila Water in Manila, Philippines FSM is a critical sanitation service in cities and towns in all countries where households use onsite sanitation systems.Peal, A., Evans, B., Blackett, I., Hawkins, P., Heymans, C. (2015). A Review of Fecal Sludge Management in 12 Cities - (Final Draft). World Bank - Water and Sanitation Program Citywide FSM programs may utilize multiple or one treatment facility, use stationary and mobile transfer stations, and engage with micro, small and medium-sized enterprises that may conduct some or all of the services. Programs may be phased in over time to accommodate growing demand. Peri urban areas Peri urban areas are often less densely populated than urban centers. Therefore, they have more space and on-site sanitation systems can be effective for solid and liquid treatment. In most such peri-urban areas, it is less likely that they will be connected to a conventional centralized sanitary sewer system in the short or medium term. Therefore, these areas will rely on a mix of onsite- sanitation systems and services, decentralized wastewater management systems, or by condominial or simplified sewerage connected to decentralized or centralized treatment. In all of these situations, FSM is a necessary service to keep the sanitation systems functioning properly. Rural areas Bad practice example: A worker removing fecal sludge out of the pit of a pit latrine without wearing any personal protective equipment (in a village in Burkina Faso). Rural areas with low population density may not need formal FSM services if the local practice is to cover and rebuild latrines when they fill up. However, if this is not possible, rural areas often lack treatment facilities within a reasonable (say 30 minutes drive) distance; are difficult for tankers to access and often have limited demand for emptying making transport and treatment uneconomic, and unaffordable for most people. Therefore, options such as relocating latrines on-site, double (alternating) pit or Arborloo toilets could be considered. Also sharing decentralized FSM services and sludge treatment between nearby villages, or direct safe removal burial of waste could be considered and organized.  Design considerations  Selecting the operator of FSM services FSM services are usually provided by formal and informal private sector service providers, local governments, water authorities and utilities. Water utilities with a high percentage of water connectivity (homes with piped water connections) are logical operators of FSM programs. If water is sold to customers through a tariff, an additional tariff to cover FSM services may be added. For larger cities, it is usually the water and sewerage service provider that will be the most appropriate operator. Local governments may choose to provide services by using their own staff and resources for collection, transportation and treatment. This is often the case in smaller cities or municipalities where the water utility may not have a broad reach. In many cases, cooperation between the city government and the water utility may be strategically advantageous. Dumaguete City, Philippines is one example where the Water District (utility) and Local Government have joint ownership and responsibilities for the FSM program.City Septage Management Program a Galing Pook, Youtube video (2013), City Planning and Devt. Office Dumaguete City, Philippines. Organized larger scale FSM programs may be able to provide the service more cheaply and more hygienically than the independent private operators working on an ad hoc basis. Ensuring services are affordable is an important selling point when promoting the program to citizens and encouraging them to participate. The local private sector is an important player in providing FSM services. In such cases, private sector contractors may work directly for households (under regulation) or bid on desludging contracts let by the city. The private sector can also provide services in operating and maintaining the treatment works, and in processing and selling the commodities resulting from the treatment process. San Fernando City, La Union, Philippines is an example of a local government that has contracted out the treatment facility construction and collection program to the private sector.  Synergy with other programs  FSM is but one aspect of citywide sanitation that also includes: * Municipal solid waste management; * Drainage and greywater management; * Wastewater collection and treatment including effluent overflows from on-site systems where soils based dispersal systems are insufficient to assimilate the volume; * Water safety; and * Food safety. There are important synergies between many of these services and FSM, and investigating co-management opportunities can yield benefits. MSW can often be co-managed with fecal waste, especially when thermal treatment technologies are used. Food waste from restaurants and markets can be co-composted with fecal waste to produce a high value soils amendment. Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG) from commercial grease traps can be added to biodigesters to increase methane production, or used in conjunction with fecal sludge as a feedstock for biodiesel production.David M. Robbins, Owen George, Rachel Burton (2011) Developing Programs to Manage Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG) for Local Governments in India, VthWorld Aqua Congress‚ÄîNew Delhi, India, November 2011 Water supply is also closely linked with FSM as it is often the water utility that will manage programs and their customers that will pay for services through tariffs.  Scheduled desludging programs  Scheduled desludging is a planned effort by the local government or utility to ensure regular desludging of septic tanks. In this process, every property is covered along a defined route and the property occupiers are informed in advance about desludging that will take place. The actual desludging (or emptying of septic tanks) can be done through a public private partnership (PPP) arrangement. In Southeast Asia, there is (in 2016) increasing interest in scheduled desludging programs as a means of providing services. A WSP study recommended that efforts to introduce scheduled emptying should focus first on areas where demand was greatest, moving on to other areas when the success of scheduled emptying had been demonstrated in these areas. Analysis of pit and tank desludging records for Palu in Indonesia revealed that existing demand for desludging services varied between sub-districts, with demand being greatest in well-established areas and least in urban fringe areas. There are multiple benefits of scheduled desludging services in the Indian context: Achieves the norms through regular desludging, reduces high prices of desludging, removes the need for manual labor, improves environmental and public health impacts, links with local taxes rather than with user charges. Scheduled desludging has been initiated in several Asian counties including the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India. A program by SNV (Netherlands Development Organisation) has developed scheduled emptying services in Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh as part of a broader urban sanitation programme during 2014-2017.ISF-UTS and SNV (2019). Scheduled emptying services as an entry point for change. The Hague: SNV  Co- treatment at wastewater treatment plants  Co-treatment of septage at wastewater treatment plants may be considered where the volume of septage removed from on-site facilities is small, as will be the case in situations where most households have access to sewerage. However, the high strength of septage and fecal sludge means that relatively small volumes of both can have a large impact on the organic, suspended solids, and nitrogen loads on a wastewater treatment plant. Possible consequences include an increase in the volume of screenings and grit requiring removal; increased odour emission at headworks; increased scum and sludge accumulation rates; and increased organic loading, leading to overloading and process failure, and the potential for increased odour and foaming in aeration tanks. Because of their partly digested nature, septage and fecal sludge will usually degrade at a slower rate than municipal wastewater. Therefore, their presence is likely to have an adverse impact on the efficacy of treatment processes. The intermittent nature of fecal sludge and septage loading can also amplify the problems identified above. Despite these possible drawbacks, wastewater treatment facilities with spare capacity are a potential resource to be investigated. Even where co- treatment is not an option, existing wastewater treatment plants may provide land in strategic locations, close to areas of demand for septage management services. Separate preliminary treatment and solids-liquid separation facilities should always be provided for septage/fecal sludge. Solids-liquid separation will reduce both the overall load and the proportion of digested material in the liquid fraction and will thus lessen the possibility that it will disrupt wastewater treatment processes. Separated solids can be treated along with the sludge produced in sedimentation tanks during the wastewater treatment process.  Technology components and infrastructure  Collection vehicles and equipment The \\"Gulper\\", a device for manual pumping of fecal sludge from pits used in eThekwini (Durban), South Africa. If the fecal sludge is liquid enough, it is usually collected by using vacuum pumps or centrifugal style booster pumps. A variety of manual and motorized devices designed to excavate thick and viscous sludge and accumulated trash are also available in the market. After sitting for years in septic tanks and pit latrines, the accumulated sludge becomes hardened and is very difficult to remove. It is still common that workers enter pits in order to desludge them, even though this practice is generally unsafe and undesirable (in India, this practice is called \\"manual scavenging\\"). A number of low-cost pumping systems exist to remove this hardened sludge hygienically from the ground surface, although many of them are still in the experimental stage (e.g. Excravator, Gulper, e-Vac). Fecal sludge can also be treated inside the tank or pit as well, by use of the \\"in-pit lime stabilization process\\", which treats the waste before it is removed from the tank or pit. This methodology was first pioneered by iDE Cambodia in 2010.iDE Cambodia (2013) Treating waste with lime, Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDGefsKq8vM Once removed, it is transported to onsite or off site treatment and processing facilities. Some advanced transfer stations and vacuum trucks can dewater fecal sludge to some extent, and this water may be placed in sewer lines to be treated in wastewater treatment plants. This allows more sludge to be dealt with more efficiently and may constitute one of the best cases of co-treatment of fecal sludge in wastewater treatment plants. Transfer stations Transfer stations are intermediary drop off locations often used where treatment facilities are located too far away from population centers to make direct disposal feasible. In other locations, traffic concerns or local truck bans during daylight hours may make transfer stations feasible. In addition, municipalities where a significant percentage of homes cannot be accessed by tanker truck should utilize transfer stations. Transfer stations are used if: * More than 5% of the homes are inaccessible by a vacuum truck; * The treatment plant is too far away from the homes for transport in one haul to be practical; * Trucks are not permitted on the streets during the day; or * Heavy traffic during daylight hours impedes the movement of vacuum trucks. = Mobile transfer stations = Mobile transfer stations are nothing more than larger tanker trucks or trailers that are deployed along with small vacuum trucks and motorcycle or hand carts. The smaller vehicles discharge to the larger tanker, which then carries the collected sludge to the treatment plant. These work well in scheduled desludging business models. = Fixed transfer stations = Fixed transfer stations are dedicated facilities installed strategically throughout the municipality that serve as drop off locations for collected fecal sludge. They may include a receiving station with screens, a tank for holding the collected waste, trash storage containers, and wash down facilities. These may be more appropriate for FSM programs using the \\"call-for-service\\" business model. While static transfer stations are fixed tanks, mobile transfer stations are simply tanker trucks or trailers that work alongside the SVVs and actually do the longer haul transferring of the waste from the community to the treatment plant. Mobile transfer stations work best for scheduled desludging programs where there are no traffic restrictions or truck bans, and a relatively large number of homes that are inaccessible to the larger vehicles. Treatment processes Drying bed for emergency fecal sludge treatment by Oxfam in the Philippines Drying bed for fecal sludge in Bangladesh Fecal Sludge is often processed through a series of treatment steps to first separate the liquids from the solids, and then treat both the liquid and solid trains while recovering as much of the energy or nutritive value as possible. Common processes at fecal sludge treatment plants include: * Fecal sludge reception - where the truck interfaces with the treatment plant and sludge is unloaded. * Preliminary treatment - to remove garbage, sand, grit, and FOG (fats, oil and grease); * Primary treatment - simple separation by physical means, or separation with microbial digestion; * Liquids treatment - for example by using constructed wetlands, waste stabilization ponds, anaerobic digesters; and * Solids processing - using the solids resulting from fecal sludge treatment for beneficial use where possible. Constructed wetlands are gaining attention as a low-cost treatment technology that can be constructed in many instances using local materials and labor. For sites with enough land and a ready supply of gravel and sand, this technology offers low cost, scalability, and simple operation.Thammarat Koottatep, Chongrak Polprasert and Nguyen Thi Kim Oanh, Design considerations of constructed wetlands for septage treatment at the AIT pilot plant =Technology selection= Training of enumerators for a survey regarding fecal sludge management needs in Nepal A formal process should be used for making an informed technology selection for the treatment of the fecal sludge. It is usually a collaborative process conducted by stakeholders, consultants, the operator and the future owner of the facility. The process is based on a long term vision planning with stakeholders as part of citywide sanitation planning. The expected waste flows (volume), their strength, characteristics, and variability in each area need to be known. A formal and transparent process for developing appropriate plans and designs for wastewater and fecal sludge treatment plants will achieve local buy-in and ownership of technology decisions, which is critical for the long term success and sustainability of the program. = Drying beds = Simple sludge drying beds can be used for dewatering and drying, as they are a cheap and simple method to dry fecal sludge (they are also widely used to dry sewage sludge). Drainage water must be captured; drying beds are sometimes covered but usually left uncovered. Drying beds are typically composed of four layers consisting of gravel and sand. The first and second layers are composed of coarse gravel that is 15 to 20 centimeters thick followed by fine gravel 10 centimeters thick. The third layer is sand that can be between 10 and 15 centimeters thick and acts as filter between sludge and gravel. Sludge dries up and water percolates to the first layer and collected at the drainage pipe located below every layer. Fecal sludges behave differently during dewatering processes than wastewater sludges. The amount of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) can be an important predictor for faecal sludge dewatering performance. Fecal sludge from public toilets took longer to dewater than sludge from other sources, and had turbid supernatant after settling. = Emerging technologies = Emerging technologies for fecal sludge treatment include: * Technologies that can produce a dried or carbonized solid fuel from fecal sludge include: drying, pelletizing, hydrothermal carbonization, and slow pyrolysis. *Thermal processes which can achieve cost effectiveness by eliminating the need for separate processes. They convert the fecal sludge along with certain fractions of sewage sludge or municipal solid waste to produce energy or fuel by using certain sewage sludge treatment technologies. * Biodiesel can be manufactured by using fats, oils and grease as feedstocks. Research by RTI International is being conducted to use fecal sludge for biodiesel production. * Electricity can be produced by thermal processes that burn fecal and solid waste together to maintain stable combustion and the heat is used to make steam that drives generators. Reuse options Sludge pellets after processing (including heating, drying and pelletizing) in a LaDePa process, eThekwini Municipality (South Africa) Resource recovery from fecal sludge can take many forms, including as a fuel, soil amendment, building material, protein, animal fodder, and water for irrigation. Some of the by-products from fecal sludge treatment processes have the potential to offset some of the costs of collection and treatment, thereby reducing tariffs for the households. However, value addition all the way to biogas, biodiesel and electricity is difficult to achieve in practice due to technological and operational challenges. = Composting = Composting is a process whereby organic matter is digested in the presence of oxygen with the byproduct of heat. For fecal sludge, the heat deactivates the pathogens while the digestion process breaks down the organic matter into a humus-like material that acts as a soils amendment, and nutrients that are broken down into a form that is more easily taken up by plants. Properly treated fecal sludge can be reused in agriculture (see also reuse of excreta). Fecal sludge is rich in nitrogen. When fecal sludge is mixed with materials that are rich in carbon, such as shredded crop wastes, the composting process can be maximized. Proper mixture to achieve a ratio of 20 to 1 to 30 to 1 of carbon to nitrogen is best. = Solid fuel = Resource recovery as a solid fuel has been found to have high market potential in Sub-Saharan Africa. The selection of the fuel type will depend on: (1) the intended use of the fuel (e.g. combustion technology, user/handling requirements, and amount required); and (2) the properties of the input fecal sludge (e.g. level of stabilization, sand content, and moisture content). Once suitable technology options are identified, they must subsequently be evaluated for best fit in the local context (e.g. local capacity for electricity, land, and technical (operation and maintenance) requirements). = Others = Biogas is a renewable energy that is a byproduct of the anaerobic digestion process. Treated effluent can be used for agricultural or landscape irrigation.  Costs and fees  FSM is considered an entry point for sanitation improvement programs that are led by local governments. Such programs may include tariffs or user fees, promotions campaigns to raise the willingness to pay for the service, and local ordinances that define the rules and regulations governing FSM. In the Philippines, tariffs around US$1 per family per month are generally enough to achieve full cost recovery within a period of 3 to 7 years. Promotional campaigns are used to raise the willingness to pay for services, and local procedures and ordinances provide additional incentives for compliance.  Examples   Dumaguete, the Philippines  USAID has supported efforts to introduce scheduled desludging services in some countries in Southeast Asia. The first of these was in Dumaguete in the Philippines. The programme was run jointly by the city government and the Dumaguete City Water District, with the former operating the treatment plant and the Water District conducting the desludging.ADB (2016). Financing Mechanisms for Wastewater and Sanitation. Asian Development Bank (ADB), Mandaluyong, Philippines. License: CC BY 3.0 IGO. Blackett, I. and Hawkins, P. (2017). FSM Innovation Case Studies - Case Studies on the Business, Policy and Technology of Faecal Sludge Management (second edition). Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA, The cost of the scheme was covered by adding a tariff of 2 pesos (about 5 US cents) to the water bill for each cubic meter of water consumed (about one US dollar per family per month). This approach was possible because around 95% of residents had a connection to the Water District reticulation system. Trucks were to move from neighbourhood to neighbourhood on a scheduled cycle, emptying pits on a regular 3-4 year cycle. This approach requires a database of all pits and septic tanks requiring desludging. However, Dumaguete has by 2018 reverted to an ‚Äòon-call‚Äô system, the cost of which is still covered by the surcharge on the water tariff. It seems that users prefer this small regular payment to having to make large payments when tanks require desludging.

SMBA was founded in 1993 and is part of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. It is the uccessor of Museum Fodor, a platform for young Amsterdam artists that ceased to exist in 1992. The goals of SMBA are to stimulate and signal contemporary art in Amsterdam and to create an international stage for this. SMBA organizes eight to ten solo and group exhibitions annually. The current head of Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam is Jelle Bouwhuis. Activities SMBA is situated at Rozenstraat 59 in Amsterdam. Apart from exhibitions other activities such as lectures, debates and (book) presentations are held here. Throughout the city of Amsterdam different projects that were made possible by SMBA take place. Examples of such projects are the residency programme BijlmAIR (in collaboration with Centrum Beeldende Kunst Zuidoost) and Artist in Residence Zuidas. Artists are invited to live and work for six months in one of the residencies and to make a work that reflects on aspects of that part of the city. SMBA is also involved with Stichting Postivisme, a programme foundation that stimulates the production and development of electronic, audiovisual, and performance art and new media. Publications On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of SMBA '10 Years SMBA, We Show Art' was published. This publication contained SMBA's newsletters until the end of 2003. The SMBA newsletter is published six times a year and gives explanation on current projects. It contains contributions by national and international specialists in the field. Some exhibitions are, apart from the newsletter, accompanied by book publications. Exhibitions Project 1975 Project 1975 started in 2010 as a two-year project with the intent to explore the relationships between contemporary art and postcolonialism. In this project the role of art and visual culture in the context of colonial practices was explored.Bouwhuis, Jelle. 'Preface'. Project 1975. Conemtporary Art and the Postcolonial Unconscious, 2014. Black Dog Publishing Limited, London, UK. The project consisted of multiple exhibitions, seminars, reading groups, articles, and a blog. \\"1975\\" refers to the year that Suriname gained independence (the independent Republic of Surinam was founded in 1975) and the Netherlands thus became to some extent \\"post-colonial\\". In relation to the project it refers to the unsettled issues that arose from colonialism and the problematic aspects of the term \\"postcolonialism\\". The project broadened SMBA's focus, traditionally on artists based in Amsterdam, to include artists and people who were new to the city but wanted to contribute to the artistic and cultural environment. Consequently, themes that had not previously been addressed in art institutions in Amsterdam found a place to be discussed at SMBA. Many questions were raised in this project. Artists and critics responded to questions such as \\"Do colonial mindsets persist in art and in its institutions?\\".Bouwhuis, Jelle. 'Preface'. Project 1975.

With a total length of 10,500 m, Yagodinska is the third longest cave in the country after Duhlata and Orlova Chuka and the longest in the Rhodopes. Yagodinska Cave is home to 11 species of bats.  Location  Yagodinska Cave is on the right bank of the river Buynovska, a tributary to the Vacha, on the slopes of the Buynovo gorge ‚Äî the longest gorge in Bulgaria. It is in Smolyan Province at 20 km to the south of the town of Devin and 3 km to south-west of the village of Yagodina. The cave is accessible through the road Devin‚ÄìDospat and has a parking lot. The cave entrance is at an altitude of 930 m.  Exploration and description  Cave pearls in Yagodinska cave The exploration of the cave commenced in 1963 by the Speleological Club of Chepelare led by Dimitar Raychev. Initially 8,500 m have been explored and 2,000 m more galleries were discovered during the second mapping of the cave in 1982-1986. The age of the cave is estimated at 275,000 years. Yagodinska Cave is 10,500 m long and has three levels, of which only a 1,100 m path in the lowest level was electrified in 1971‚Äì1982 and opened for tourists. The entrance and the exit for that level are artificial tunnels with a length of 150 and 80 m respectively. The altitude of the entrance and the exit is 930 m and 937 m respectively. The temperature in the show cave is constant all year round at 6¬∫–°; the humidity is 85%‚Äì91%. Yagodinska contains a very large number of cave formations, or speleothems, including stalactites, stalagmites, stalagnates, flowstone, draperies and cave pearls. The natural entrance leads to the uppermost level, where an ancient dwelling dated to the 4th millennium BC was discovered. Excavations have proven that the dwelling was an important centre producing ceramics. The clay was extracted from the interior of the cave and from the bed of the Boynovska River. The pottery was baked in clay furnaces. The inhabitants abandoned the site as a result of a collapse caused by an earthquake.  Fauna  Yagodinska Cave is an important site for bats due to the large length of its galleries. The cave is home to 11 species of bats. Of these, six species are of conservation importance in Europe: the greater and the lesser horseshoe bats, the greater and lesser mouse-eared bats, Bechstein's bat and Geoffroy's bat. List of the recorded species: * greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) * lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) * Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii) * Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus) * greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) * lesser mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythii) * whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) * Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) * serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) * brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) * grey long- eared bat (Plecotus austriacus) See also *Geography of Bulgaria *List of caves in Bulgaria *List of protected areas of Bulgaria *List of rock formations in Bulgaria  Citations   External links   Show caves in Bulgaria Rhodope Mountains Landforms of Smolyan Province Tourist attractions in Smolyan Province Caves of Bulgaria ","title":"Yagodinska Cave"},{"id":"47075356","text":"Penicillium parvum is an anamorph species of fungus in the genus Penicillium which was isolated from soil in Papua New Guinea.ATCC Penicillium parvum produces ferrichrome siderophores Phytochemical investigation of the soil microfungus Eupenicillum parvum led to the isolation of two new compounds: a chromone derivative euparvione and a new mycophenolic derivative euparvilactone, as well as thirteen known compounds.

The Oeconomist took a moralising as well as a political tone. Scrivener identifies its values as pastoral, the intended audience being those engaged in farming. Its thought was taken from the Country Party and physiocrats. Practical arrangements In London The Oeconomist was circulated by Joseph Johnson. For towns not handled by Johnson there were separate arrangements with other booksellers, such as Joseph Cottle; the announcement in the Newcastle Courant of 9 December 1797 mentioned Benjamin Flower. It was subsidised by funds raised from Bigge, Wyvill and others. The price was reduced, from 3¬Ωd. to 2d., in February 1799; or raised from 1¬Ωd. to 2d.Eneas Mackenzie, 'Trade and manufactures', in Historical Account of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne Including the Borough of Gateshead (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1827), pp. 715‚Äì730 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical- account/pp715-730 [accessed 23 June 2015]. The woodcut for the cover was the work of Charlton Nesbit in 1797‚Äîit was attributed though to Thomas Bewick in the 19th century. The publication lasted until the end of the year, printed by M. Angus. Ritchie identifies the editor of The Oeconomist, working with Losh, instead as Thomas Bigge the brother of John Thomas Bigge, i.e. Thomas Hanway Bigge. Related political tracts A political tract, full title Considerations on the State of Parties, and the Means of effecting a Reconciliation between them and often dated 1794, spoke of a balanced tension within British politics. Its author was described as Thomas Bigge A.M.; and the same author was also responsible for An Address to the Inhabitants of Northumberland and Newcastle upon Tyne, who petitioned against the two bills depending in parliament (1795). Both works were favourably noticed in The Monthly Review; the second also in The Critical Review. and The Analytical Review.

It shows architectonical integration of many styles through different centuries. Although the monastery was founded in the 16th century, it was modified by two natural disasters in the 17th century. In 1669 the 1669 Etna eruption surrounded the city of Catania, widening the coast for more than 1 km, and the monastery too. So the monastery was not destroyed by the lava but the area around was completely modified by a lava bench 12 meters high. In 1693 the earthquake of Val di Noto destroyed the entire east coast of Sicily and Catania. The monastery was terribly damaged and the only floor that survived was the basement. In 1702 the rebuilding started and lasted until 1866 (when the new Reign of Italy confiscated the monastery).

Warrington & Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust claims it has permitted them to reduce the use of bank and agency staff. Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust has established a Responsive Workforce Model using HealthRoster Software and SafeCare, which they say has been crucial in permitting them to reduce expenditure on agency staff, ensured quality and freed up nurses for hands-on care.

Rembrandt van Rijn, 1636, St√§del Frankfurt Blinding is a type of physical punishment which results in complete or nearly complete loss of vision. It has been used as an act of revenge and torture. The punishment has been used since Antiquity; Greek mythology makes several references to blinding as divine punishment, which reflects human practice. In the Byzantine Empire and many other historical societies, blinding was accomplished by gouging out the eyes, sometimes using a hot poker, and by pouring a boiling substance, such as vinegar, on them. Examples In mythology and religious law Oedipus gouged out his own eyes after accidentally fulfilling the prophecy that he would end up killing his father and marrying his mother. In the Bible, Samson was blinded upon his capture by the Philistines. Early Christians were often blinded as a penalty for their beliefs. For example, St. Lucy's torturers tore out her eyes. In history In the Middle Ages, blinding was used as a penalty for treason or as a means of rendering a political opponent unable to rule and lead an army in war. Byzantine general Belisarius ( - 565) is said to have been blinded at the order of the Emperor Justinian. Vazul (before 997 ‚Äì 1031/1032) of the Hungarian royal House of √Årp√°d was blinded at the order either of his cousin King Stephen I or of his queen, Gisela. After the Battle of Kleidion of 1014, the Byzantine Emperor Basil II had captured several thousand soldiers from the Bulgarian Empire. He put them into groups of 100 and blinded 99 in every group. The last soldiers had only one eye gouged out, and these one-eyed men were ordered to lead their blind friends back to their commander. This earned Emperor Basil II the nickname of 'the Bulgar Slayer'. According to some accounts of the story, Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria died from a heart attack upon seeing the returning blind soldiers. In the 11th century, William the Conqueror used blinding as a punishment for rebellion to replace the death penalty in his laws for England. King William was also accused of making the killing of a hart or hind in a royal forest into a crime punishable by blinding, but the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle claims that this was made up to tarnish the King's reputation. Henry I of England blinded William, Count of Mortain, who had fought against him at Tinchebray in 1106. He also ordered blinding and castration as a punishment for thieves. Prince √Ålmos and his four-year-old son B√©la II of Hungary were blinded in 1113 by √Ålmos' brother Coloman. Modern Era Blinding survives as a form of penalty in the modern era, especially on the Indian Subcontinent. In 2003, a Pakistani court sentenced a man to be blinded after he subjected his fiancee to an acid attack resulting in loss of vision. The man who blinded Ameneh Bahrami in an acid attack was sentenced to blinding by an Iranian court in 2009; Bahrami eventually pardoned the attacker.

Common in the arid lowlands of the Gal√°pagos, its relatively large yellow flowers make it easy to identify. Description Cordia lutea grows as a shrub or a small tree, up to tall. The young branches are hairy. The undivided leaves are arranged alternately, and are long, ovate to round in shape, with very finely toothed margins. The upper side of the leaf is rough in texture but hairless; the lower side bears hairs. The yellow flowers are arranged in cymes and are sweetly scented. The petals of each flower are fused together to form a trumpet shape, across at the mouth, which has five to eight lobes. Inside the flower there are five to eight stamens. After fertilization, a globular white fruit (a drupe) forms, across, containing from one to four seeds. The fruit has a fleshy pulp that is initially slimy when the fruit is opened, but becomes sticky on exposure. Cordia lutea 150521.jpgIn habitat on the edge of a beach, with Cryptocarpus pyriformis, Santa F√©, Galap√°gos Cordia lutea flowers 150521.jpgFlowers Taxonomy Cordia lutea was first described scientifically in 1791 by the French botanist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, with its origin said to be Peru. The specific epithet lutea means \\"yellow\\", more usually a deep yellow. In 1852, the Swedish botanist Nils Johan Andersson collected in the Gal√°pagos Islands, and in 1855 described Varronia flava, now considered to be the same species as Cordia lutea. In regions such as the Gal√°pagos, where several species of Cordia occur, C. lutea is said to be easy to identify, \\"due to its showy yellow flowers\\". Phylogeny A molecular phylogenetic study in 2005 suggested that Cordia lutea is most closely related to C. dentata, both from the New World, and that these two are the sister of a large clade of Old World species, together forming the Myxa clade within the genus. It is suggested that the origin of the clade was in the New World, from where it was dispersed to Africa and beyond by birds. Distribution and habitat Cordia lutea is native to Ecuador, both the western part of the mainland and the Gal√°pagos Islands, Peru, and the Marquesas Islands in Polynesia. It grows in arid regions. In the Gal√°pagos, it is found in the lowlands, often close to the sea.

It lasted from 987 to 1030, during the reign of the Ottonian emperors Otto III and Henry II as well as of their Salian successor Conrad II. Background The conflict flared up for the first time in 987, when Sophia, a daughter of late Emperor Otto II who had been raised in Gandersheim since 979, should become invested as a canoness. Aware of her royal origin, she refused to become invested by the local Bishop Osdag of Hildesheim and insisted on an ordination by the Mainz archbishop Willigis. Diocesan territories of Hildesheim (violet) and Mainz (yellow) before German mediatization The Mainz archbishop took the occasion to file a claim to the jurisdiction over the Gandersheim estates: the monastery had been founded in 852 at nearby Brunshausen, which belongs to the Diocese of Hildesheim, however, four years later the canonesses had moved to the present location in Gandersheim, thereby crossing the border with the Archdiocese of Mainz. The bishops of Hildesheim continued to exercise episcopal authority, though against the will of the Mainz archbishops. Empress dowager Theophanu, acting as regent for Sophia's brother Otto III, arbitrated between the parties and reached an agreement under which both bishops, Willigis of Mainz and Osdag of Hildesheim, invested Sophia as a canoness. Consequently, the conflict was averted for the time being. When the Saxon noble Bernward, a close friend to King Otto III, became Bishop of Hildesheim in 993, he initially maintained friendly relations with Archbishop Willigis. However, Sophia displeased him when she stayed at the royal court of her brother for two years between 995 and 997, a very unusual behaviour for a canoness. Bishop Bernward sent Sophia back to Gandersheim, in consequence she got infuriated. Furthermore, he intrigued against Willigis, as Bernward felt that the archbishop had tempted Sophia to leave her monastery, and arranged his removal from the group of advisors to King Otto. Continuation On 14 September 1000 the rebuilt premises of Gandersheim Abbey, which had been destroyed by a fire in 973, were supposed to be consecrated again. Meanwhile, Sophia undertook the tasks of the Abbess Gerberga II, who had fallen seriously ill. She wanted Archbishop Willigis to consecrate the newly erected abbey church and Bernward was convinced that the consecration of the abbey fell into the Mainz area of responsibility. Sophia only involved Willigis into the planning of the ceremony and sent Bernward an invitation. Bernward accepted and announced his arrival on September 14. Later however, Archbishop Willigis postponed the celebrations by one week to the date of September 21, when Bernward was tied up by other commitments at the imperial court. Bernward appeared in Gandersheim on the original date, but had to realize that the ceremony had not been prepared. So he hold a holy mass and lamented that Sophia denied him the right to consecrate the abbey. The mass turned into a riot and Bernward left Gandersheim without having achieved anything. One week later, Archbishop Willigis arrived in Gandersheim. Bernward did not appear due to his other commitments, so Willigis demanded for him being present the next day, otherwise he would consecrate the abbey all by himself. Bernward, however, had anticipated Willigis plans by sending the Schleswig bishop Ekkehard as his representative. With reference to canon law, Ekkehard was able to prevent the consecration by Willigis. Holy Roman Empire, 972‚Äì1032 Furious, Willigis convened a provincial synod in Gandersheim on November 28, where Bernward did also not appear as he was already on the way to Rome to tell Pope Sylvester II and Emperor Otto III about the incidents. He reached Rome on 4 January 1001, just two days later, a legate of Bishop Ekkehard appeared and reported the arguments at the Gandersheim synod. Both the pope and the emperor were angry about the happenings. On January 13, a papal synod nullified all Gandersheim proceedings. In a sharp letter, Archbishop Willigis was reprimanded and urged to hand off the rights about Gandersheim. Willigis, however, did not react and still hindered Bernward from doing his official duties ‚Äì with the support by Sophia, who had provoked the collegiate chapter against him. Another synod was held by a papal legate at P√∂hlde on 21/22 June, where Willigis armed followers aborted the reading out of the papal letter. More meetings were necessary to solve the conflict: Willigis invited Bernward to a synod in Frankfurt on August 15, however, the Hildesheim bishop fell ill and again sent Ekkehard of Schleswig and his confidant Thangmar; much to the annoyance of Willigis, who questioned Bernward's disease and demanded an oath by his representatives. The meeting failed and Emperor Otto called for another convention at Todi on December 27. Given the weather conditions, few bishops had arrived by then; the meeting was postponed to 6 January 1002 and finally cancelled when the emperor died on January 24. Therefore, the Gandersheim Conflict remained unsolved. Under Otto's successor, King Henry II, the conflict was still smouldering. The situation between the Mainz and Hildesheim dioceses remained tense. In view of this circumstances, Henry invited both bishops on Christmas 1006 to P√∂hlde. Both bishops appeared and deferred to the will of the king. The new date for the consecration of Gandersheim Abbey was scheduled on 5 January 1007; Bernward had the task to plan the ceremony. Henry II participated in the consecration and during the mass he officially declared that the jurisdiction over Gandersheim was the task of the Hildesheim bishops. Willigis reluctantly had to agree to the compromise; in turn, he had the honor to officiate at the consecration of the abbey. The archbishop died in 1011. Neither he nor his successor Erkanbald resumed the quarrels. Resolution The conflict again flared up, when upon Erkanbald's death in 1021 Aribo became archbishop. Though he had vowed to Emperor Henry not to resume the Gandersheim Conflict, he asked the new Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim to enter in negotiations. Gotthard was invested by Archbishop Aribo of Mainz in 1022, whereby he forbade the new Hildesheim bishop any official act or religious ceremony in Gandersheim. Godehard referred to the 1007 compromise and lodged a complaint with Emperor Henry II, who had to resolve the crisis again before he died in 1024. Tables seemed to turn under Henry's successor, the first Salian king Conrad II, who was crowned King of the Romans by Aribo at Mainz Cathedral. The archbishop was already one of his closest friends, had ensured the new king's election, and now saw the opportunity to get the jurisdiction over Gandersheim again. Bishop Godehard, however, became aware of his plan and invited Conrad and his followers to Hildesheim. During his stay in Hildesheim in January 1025, Aribo lamented that he and not Godehard was the authorized bishop of Gandersheim. Conrad II gave both bishops his promise that he would solve the conflict at a diet in the nearby Palace of Goslar on January 27. Here both bishops were deprived of their authority over Gandersheim, which temporarily was assigned to Bishop Branthog of Halberstadt. Nevertheless, when Conrad proceeded to Gandersheim the next day, Godehard hurried ahead to receive him with much pomp as a host, to the annoyance of the king and Archbishop Aribo. After Bishop Godehard had fallen prostrate at Conrad's feet requesting his mercy, the king at a synod in March 1025 decided in favor of Hildesheim. Archbishop Aribo initially made no protest but in summer asked for another convention. While his relations with Conrad and also with Abbess Sophia deteriorated, he and Godehard met in the Eichsfeld, though no solution was found. Another rapprochement initiated by King Conrad on 21 September 1026 in Seligenstadt failed too. The jurisdiction of Hildesheim was confirmed by a 1027 synod in Frankfurt, while Aribo continuously tried to have the resolutions revoked. Finally Conrad pushed both sides to a compromise, that finally was found during another meeting in P√∂hlde: Hildesheim was given the jurisdiction over Gandersheim, conversely Mainz was vested with several surrounding estates. On 17 May 1030 the emperor celebrated Pentecost at Merseburg Cathedral, whereby he proclaimed the solution of the long-time quarrels. Later Aribo's successor Archbishop Bardo officially renounced any claims to Gandersheim Abbey. Thereafter the conflict did not arise again.

According to another thesis the name derives from the Greek œÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ ŒïŒπŒ∏Œ∑ŒªŒøœÇ (Polizzello), although so far there is no archaeological evidence that may indicate the presence of a Greek settlement in the area. The site is located on a hill at 877 m above sea level and is near Mussomeli in the Province of Caltanissetta. The site is great for a human settlement for its easily defensible position and for the presence of water sources. It consists of two plateaus of which the upper smallest one is home of Acropolis and place of the first protohistoric and archaic settlement, moreover; the site has an east‚Äìwest orientation with a single access from east. Historically, the site had three significant phases: # Early Bronze Age (19th-16th centuries BC), of which remain some chamber tombs of Castelluccio period and a circular hut with ornaments placed on the eastern side of the mountain. # 11th-9th centuries BC with the creation of an Acropolis placed on top of the hill. # 8th-6th centuries BC, period of maximum development of the center, of which remains a monumental fence that runs along the edge of the terrace on the hill and a series of circular buildings: Sacelli, places of worship.

Lynch had been a class leader in the Methodist church, but following an 1887 angelic vision became convinced that salvation was impossible without Holiness (c.f. Holiness movement). Lynch was rejected from the Methodist church for his belief, along with his growing number of followers. The movement established by him and his colleague Sarah Collins (sanctified in 1889) became known as the Sanctified Band, Sanctification Band, or Lynchites. The group drew attention for its unusual practices: they lived in houseboats based on the Biblical Ark. The community's belief in sanctification was taken to mean that acts that would normally be sinful are not sinful to the sanctified, and thus they had customs which their neighbors interpreted as free love and bigamy such as the \\"watch mate\\" practice where spouses from different married couples would spend time alone together. Members of the movement were killed by local vigilantes, and Lynch, Collins, and two other men were arrested for free love offenses, and jailed and fined by the authorities. There precipitated a migration of Lynch's followers out of the area, selling their possessions and relocating to other Southern states. Lynch died in Fernandina, Florida of typhoid fever in 1900. Movement today The movement, Christ's Sanctified Holy Church, continues to exist in parts of the Southern United States, with some 15 churches.

The Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) estimates, based on Qatar¬¥s Foreign Aid Report 2013, that USD 1.3 billion of Qatar's foreign aid can be considered as Official Development Assistance (ODA).Benn, J. and W. Luijkx (2017), \\"Emerging providers‚Äô international co-operation for development\\", OECD Development Co- operation Working Papers, No. 33, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/15d6a3c7-en. According to the UN OCHA‚Äôs Financial Tracking Service, Qatar‚Äôs international aid increased from less than $10 million annually in the pre-Arab Spring period to the hundreds of millions following the event. For example in 2012, according to the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the country donated more than QAR3 billion (or c. ¬£524 million) through both governmental and non-governmental aid to nearly 100 countries across the globe. Qatari leadership has since pledged publicly to reduce the suffering of victims and to achieve and support global partnerships for the achievement of foreign countries‚Äô Millennium Development Goals. The state is currently engaged in investments in a wide range of humanitarian and developmental sectors. Aims According to the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs, helping countries achieve internationally agreed development goals is the main objective of the program. Additionally, poverty reduction, including through employment creation in rebuilding and infrastructure projects, improved health and education as well as better management of the environment, are the main areas of focus of Qatar's international cooperation. Qatar also promotes dialogue through soft power diplomacy initiatives in regional and international affairs, hoping to consolidate peace and stability, in addition to good relations with neighbouring countries and strategic alliances with major powers. Areas of focus Qatar's foreign aid focuses principally on the Arab world. For example, in 2013, around 93 percent of Qatar's Official Development Assistance (ODA) went to countries in the region. Syria was the largest recipient, receiving $422 million, with much of this going towards humanitarian needs. Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Yemen and Lebanon were among the other main recipients. The Arab world =Syria= Since the Syrian revolution of 2011, Qatar's stance has been well known to the international political scene, making repeated calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and for new elections. Qatar has donated in excess of $1.6 billion to Syria in humanitarian aid for victims of the conflict in Syria, according to an article by Qatar's foreign minister in Britain‚Äôs Daily Telegraph in February 2015, despite allegations in 2013 that $650m pledged to the UN remained undelivered. =Gaza (Palestine)= In the aftermath of the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, Qatar was the biggest aid donor with a pledge of $1 billion. Much of this funding went towards the construction of destroyed homes, as well as towards the repair and construction of two vital roads in the region, the Saladin and al-Rashid highways. In August 2019, Qatar increased the number of beneficiaries of aid in the Gaza strip from 60,000 up to 100,000 families. Each family received $100 in cash, the seventh such distributions in a year. = Lebanon = Qatar contributed $3mn in funding to the restoration of Lebanon following the 2006 Lebanon War, and financed the reconstruction of over 12,000 residential units and a number of buildings in 195 villages in southern Lebanon. =Egypt= Following the overthrow of Egypt‚Äôs President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, Qatar provided loans worth $4 billion and aid totalling $1 billion to help Egypt manage its political instability. =Yemen= Qatar has donated $500 million in humanitarian aid to two Yemeni provinces to help people displaced by the Houthi rebellion. International Powers and Strategic Partners =United States of America= Following Hurricane Katrina in 2007, the former Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani donated $100 million to afflicted areas around New Orleans and beyond. =Japan= Qatar donated to Japan after the earthquake in March 2011. In addition to providing natural gas shipments to the country, Qatar also hosted a high-profile football charity match in order to raise funds. This support was also formalised through the establishment of the Qatar Friendship Fund. Major crises regardless of location =Nepal= In 2015, Qatar provided material and logistical assistance to Nepal following the earthquake. A total of QR12 million (c.¬£2.09 million) was also raised. =Philippines= Qatar provided significant relief to the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. The Qatar Red Crescent donated around $70,000 in immediate aid, while an appeal to raise a further $2 million was launched. Qatar's Ministry of Foreign affairs sent two planeloads of aid to affected areas. = Haiti= The Prime Minister of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani announced a $20 million donation in 2010 to Haiti following the earthquake. Non-governmental donations A large share of Qatar's total international assistance comes from private non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and foundations. In 2013, slightly more than one-fifth of the total aid was made by these NGOs, the largest of which are: * Qatar Charity * Sheikh Eid bin Mohammad Al Thani Charitable Association * Foundation Sheikh Thani Ibn Abdullah for Humanitarian Services (RAF) * Reach Out To Asia * Qatar Red Crescent See also *Aid *Foreign relations of Qatar *Humanitarian aid during the Syrian Civil War *Arab League peace plans for Syria *Saudi foreign assistance *Administration of federal assistance in the United States References Contributions to foreign aid by country Foreign relations of Qatar ","title":"Qatari foreign aid"},{"id":"47076314","text":"Field hockey at the 2014 Asian Games for women was held in Incheon, South Korea from 22 September to 1 October, 2014.

Built c. 1826, the building is a fine blend of late Federal and Greek Revival styling. It is most significant as the longtime home of Henry Knox Thatcher, an admiral in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Thatcher House stands at the northeast corner of Main and Elm Streets, on the eastern edge of Mercer's rural village center. The main block is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. It faces west, toward the village and Elm Street. The main entrance is centered, with flanking sidelights and simple Greek Revival trim. An ell extends east, joining the main house to a small stable that has been converted into garage. The interior of the house follows a typical Federal period center hall plan, with the front rooms on both floors trimmed in Greek Revival styling, and the rear rooms retaining Federal styling. The house was built in stages beginning sometime between 1818 and 1826. The rear ell of the house that Joseph Campbell sold to Henry Knox Thatcher in 1832 was probably built in that time; Campbell built the main house between 1826 and 1832. Thatcher, the grandson of American Revolutionary War general Henry Knox, served in the United States Navy for more than 50 years, rising to the rank of rear admiral. His most active period of service was during the American Civil War, where he commanded squadrons engaged in blockading Confederate ports, and directed the naval activities in the First and Second Battles of Fort Fisher.

The prize money is intended for realising the team's idea. NEMO is developing new ways to digitise and transmit emotion online. The team is planning small add-ons for digital interaction platforms that would consider emotions. This way participants in online discussions could see or even experience the emotions of others in a new way that would be equivalent to natural interaction. The team wants to create an open protocol for emotion transmission for any coder to use for building new empathy-enabling applications. Biodiversity Now team wants to establish a Finnish habitat bank so that, for example, companies reducing biodiversity through a construction project could offset this by increasing biodiversity elsewhere.https://www.sttinfo.fi/tiedote/the-internet-of-empathy- receives-the-helsinki-challenge-prize- of-250000?publisherId=1807796&releaseId;=36507619 Helsinki Challenge 2016‚Äì2017 The second Helsinki Challenge was kicked off in August 2016.

The Chalet d‚ÄôAsdonck was formerly the main residence of a general in the Belgian army. The original owner of the land was Edouard- Charles Henrard, an officer in the army and professor at the Brussels Military Academy, the √âcole Royale Militaire. Mr Henrard bought the land in 1898 from the city of Leopoldsburg (formerly known as Bourg St Leopold) and set out to build a villa for himself and his spouse, Anne-Petrouille Dobbelaere. The land, more than 65 hectares including a homestead, was purchased for 12.000 Belgian francs, the currency of the time. Nowadays the equivalent would be 300 euros. On this land a sizable country house was constructed. Soon after a landscaping project was carried out, to create a park around the house, including a forest and pond. In the present day, the house and park still remain. After some years of neglect, the house itself was renovated by its current owners, entrepreneur Ludo Gielen and his wife Nathalie Riga.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Blackburn. The church was built in 1838, extended in 1861 and again in 1882. It is constructed mainly in limestone, and consists of a nave, a north aisle, a chancel and a west tower. Inside is a west gallery and stained glass by Shrigley and Hunt. The church holds services on Sundays and Wednesdays. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1838, and its design has been attributed to George Webster. The north aisle was added in 1861, and the chancel in 1882. It was originally a chapel of ease in the parish of St Oswald, Warton, and became a parish in its own right on 25 September 1870. Architecture Exterior St John's is constructed in limestone rubble with limestone dressings in the main part of the church, and sandstone dressings in the chancel. The tower is pebbledashed and the roof is slated. The plan consists of a five-bay nave, a north aisle, a chancel, and a west tower. In the tower is a west doorway with a pointed head and a hood mould. This is flanked by buttresses, lancet windows with hood moulds, and more buttresses on the corners of the tower. Above the doorway is a window with a pointed head containing Y-tracery, and at the top of the tower is a projecting battlemented parapet.

He was one of the leaders of the Art Deco movement, and had huge influence in France and elsewhere. After the war he became head of the Pomone decorative art workshop of Le Bon March√© department store, making affordable but still elegant and high-quality work. Life Art Nouveau entrance with ceramics of Follot's house built in 1911 at 5 rue Schoelcher, Paris Paul Follot was born in 1877 in Paris. His father was the wallpaper manufacturer F√©lix Follot, of the Societ√© Charles Follot. Paul Follot trained as a sculptor. He became a student of Eug√®ne Grasset. Between 1901 and 1903 he made Art Nouveau silver objects, textiles, bronzes and jewelry for Julius Meier-Graefe's Paris showroom La Maison Moderne. Maurice Dufr√™ne also worked for Meier-Graefe, and strongly influenced Follot. In 1903 Follot was a founding member of L'Art dans Tout (Art in Everything), a group of artists who strongly promoted French artisan work in the face of industrial products, particularly from Germany. From 1904 Follot headed his own decorating company, catering to a wealthy clientele, and gained a reputation for quality and elegance. He made luxury furniture for his company. He designed textiles for Cornille et Cie, carpets for the Savonnerie manufactory and silver for Christofle throughout his career. In 1911 he made china designs for the Wedgwood company of England. Between 1910 and 1914 he designed new forms of jewelry. In 1913 he designed furniture for Germain Lubin in which the motif was the cornucopia. Follot also taught a course on decorative art for the city of Paris. Follot became one of the leaders of the Art Deco movement. He had huge influence beyond France and his style was often copied. After World War I more of the large department stores began to operate workshops to make furniture and decorative art objects for the middle classes. In 1923 Follot took charge of the Pomone decorative art workshop of Le Bon March√© department store, which made affordable, good quality furniture and decorations. He designed the symbol of the workshop, a tree laden with fruit. The Pomone pavilion at the 1925 International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in Paris was a great success. Follot had designed every room in the pavilion, and also contributed an antechamber to the exposition's model ‚ÄúModern French Embassy.‚Äù From 1928 Follot was a director of the Paris branch of Waring & Gillow, an English furniture company. In collaboration with Serge Chermayeff he introduced the motifs of fruit, garlands and cornucopia to the firm. Follot resumed an independent practice as a decorator in 1931. In 1935 he was commissioned to decorate the liner SS Normandie. That year he exhibited at the Brussels International Exposition. Paul Follot died in 1941 in Sainte-Maxime. Style Tea tray for Christofle, 1903, Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris Paul Follot's early designs reflect the Gothic Revival, with foliate motifs. Follot acquired a taste for wooden motifs and carvings from Grasset. The stylized motifs of baskets of fruit or of flowers were typically carved from solid wood by Laurent Malcl√®s. Follot made well-upholstered pieces in gently curved and ornamented giltwood frames. He liked using rare materials, with inlays of contrasting colors and gilded bronze friezes. His furniture became closer to the styles of Louis XVI or of the Empire than to contemporary Art Nouveau. After 1910 Follot's designs became quieter and more classical as his style evolved towards Art Deco. Follot's dining room ensemble in sycamore, ebony and amarath, exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in 1912, is considered to be one of the first examples of Art Deco. It follows the precepts defined by Andr√© Vera in his manifesto L'Art d√©coratif of January 1912. The backs of the chairs in this set had an openwork design that represented a basket of fruit and flowers. Follot was an Art Deco \\"purist\\", and saw his work as refinement of classical French design. Follot designed textiles and wallpapers in traditional and modern styles. In 1928 Follot said, ‚ÄúWe know that the 'necessary' alone is not sufficient for man and that the superfluous is indispensable for him, otherwise let us also suppress music, flowers, perfumes‚Ä¶ and the smiles of ladies!‚Äù Writing of Follot's interiors in Art et D√©coration (1929) the critic Gabriel Mourey stated that ‚Äú[O]ne breathes a comfortable and precious atmosphere, sheltered from the noise, agitation, and tumultuousness of the outside world.

Hong Yi is a Malaysian born artist and architectural designer better known by her moniker, 'Red'. She is known for using everyday objects and materials for her paintings and art installations to transform our understanding of objects and image-making, as an artist who 'paints without a paintbrush'.  Early life and education  Red was born in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. In 2004, she attended the Foundation Studies program at Trinity College (University of Melbourne), and subsequently graduated with a Bachelor of Planning and Design in 2007 and a Master of Architecture in 2010 from the University of Melbourne before moving to Shanghai to work for Australian architecture firm HASSELL. Captivated by her new environment in Shanghai, Red was inspired to create artwork that documented this new chapter of her life, and uploaded videos of her work online went viral. She was encouraged by her boss to take a six-month sabbatical to explore her career in art before quitting to be a full-time artist in January 2013. In May 2019, she was awarded the inaugural Foundation Studies Alumna of the Year Award by Trinity College (University of Melbourne) for her contribution to the visual arts.  Work  Inspired by China's production power and abundance of materials found in wholesale markets, Red discovered her style of art by using materials in bulk to create portraits of well-known Chinese personalities. Her other work includes a portrait of Ai Weiwei with seven kilograms of sunflower seeds as a tribute to his porcelain Sunflower Seeds installation, Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou with 2000 socks, singer Jay Chou with coffee cup stains as a tribute to his song \\"Secret\\", Aung Saan Su Kyi with 2000 dyed carnations noting the way she ties flowers in her hair, and singer Adele with thousands of melted tealight candles as a tribute to her song, \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\". Her work has been sought after by clients around the world and she has been invited to speak in conferences internationally. In 2014, Jackie Chan commissioned her to create a portrait of himself with 64,000 chopsticks for his 60th birthday, and video of the artwork has been watched 1.9million times on YouTube. In 2015, she was invited to present her work, 'Teh Tarik Man', made of 20,000 dyed teabags, during Malaysian Night at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. She was named as the top 12 'Brilliant Malaysians' and 'Brilliant Artist Award' by Esquire Magazine, awarded Perspective's 40 Under 40 award as a creative who will shape the design world in the years to come, and one of the 19 \\"Future Chasers\\" by Australia Unlimited as future decision-makers of courage, imagination and will. Red has traveled to Cambodia to meet her sponsored child and to raise awareness of conditions there, in partnership with World Vision. Red has created a series in response to anti-Asian racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic. She was listed as one of the most influential voices in Asia in May 2020 by Tatler Hong Kong. Popular culture In June 2018, the JPMorgan Chase Bank commenced an advertising campaign that showcased their \\"mobile app\\" payment.

The Fog of War won the Academy Award for Best Documentary. Kids for cash In the Kids for cash scandal, judge Mark Ciavarella, who promoted a platform of zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders, and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a principal on Myspace, scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting DVDs from Wal-mart.

He led the team which developed the TIFRAC, the first Indian indigenous computer and was instrumental in the establishment of CMC Limited in 1975, a Government of India company, later bought by Tata Consultancy Services. He was a recipient of the fourth highest Indian civilian award of Padma Shri from the Government of India in 1977. Biography The Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Narasimhan's early researches were hosted by the university Rangaswamy Narasimhan was born on 17 April 1926 in Chennai in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. He graduated with honours in Telecommunication engineering from College of Engineering, Guindy, then part of University of Madras in 1947 and moved to US to obtain his master's degree (MS) in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology. He stayed in US to secure a doctoral degree (PhD) in mathematics from Indiana University. In 1954, he returned to India, accepting Homi J. Bhabha's invitation to join the project team set up by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, (TIFR) Mumbai for the development of the first indigenous computer. Five years later, the prototype of the computer was ready and the computer was inaugurated by the then prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, who named the equipment as Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Automatic Calculator (TIFRAC). In 1961, he went back to Illinois, US to conduct further research on cognitive science at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and worked as a visiting scientist at the Digital Computer Laboratory of the university till 1964. His next assignment at TIFR was the establishment of a software development centre and that is reported to have paved way for the founding of the National Center for Software Development and Computing Techniques (NCSDCT) under TIFR. The institution was later renamed as the National Centre for Software Technology and was merged into the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in 2003. In August 1963, the Government of India set up an interdepartmental Electronics Committee under the chairmanship of Vikram Sarabhai for finding ways for self-sufficiency in the electronics industry sector and Narasimhan was made the chairman of one of the sub committees, entrusted with the responsibility to look into the possibilities of finding ways to reduce dependence on IBM and International Computers Limited. One of the recommendations of Narasimhan Committee was to establish a national organization for manufacture and maintenance of computers which was later endorsed by the Electronics Commission, headed by M. G. K. Menon, and Narasimhan was entrusted with the responsibility which resulted in the formation of Computer Maintenance Corporation, later day CMC Limited as a fully owned government company in 1977 with Narasimhan as its founder chairman. He was also connected with TIFR at their National Centre for Software Development Computing Techniques from 1975 to 1985. Narasimhan was associated with several agencies and organizations for his research; the Industrial Design Centre at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, the Speech Pathology Unit of Topiwala National Medical College and Nair Hospital, the All India Institute of Speech and Hearing, the Central Institute of Indian Languages, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, and the Centre for Applied Cognitive Science at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, Toronto were some of them. He sat on the council of the International Federation for Information Processing as the representative of India during 1975-86 and was a member of the Scientific Advisory Council of the Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research from 1988 to 1990. He retired from TIFR service in 1990 as a professor of eminence but retained his association with CMC past his retirement in the capacity as an advisor even after the company was bought by Tata Consultancy Services in 2001. He died on 3 September 2007, at the age of 81, in Bengaluru in Karnataka. Legacy Besides the contributions in the development of the first Indian computer and founding of CMC and the National Center for Software Development and Computing Techniques, Narasimhan was involved in bringing the computer sector in India together and was successful in founding a society, the Computer Society of India in 1964 and became its founder president, a post he held till 1969. He was involved in research in the area of the theory of behaviour, extending his studies to first language acquisition, artificial intelligence, computational modelling of behaviour and modelling language behaviour, and was reported to be the first to discover an analogy between ‚Ä≥formal grammars of natural languages and the formal structures underlying picture processing‚Ä≥. He carried on his research on synthetic pattern recognition during his stint at the University of Illinois from 1961 to 1964 into TIFR and ‚Ä≥developed a meta theory and approach to the study of language behaviour‚Ä≥. His argument was that the use of behaviour to specific uses must have been evolutionary and as such, use must define the structure or mechanism. This was the topic of his book, Modeling Language Behaviour, which is considered to have offered alternatives to the concepts of Noam Chomsky, drawing comparisons with the American cognitive scientist. Narasimhan studied the environment a child (9 months to 3 years) is exposed to while he or she acquired their first language. This ethological study of language behaviour acquisition led him to the discovery that the pre-literate oral language behaviour differed from the literate language behaviour and while the former is genetic, the latter is acquired. He postulated that this difference was analogous to connectionist Artificial Intelligence that included non literate modes of functioning and rule-based Artificial Intelligence. His book, Artificial Intelligence and the Study of Agentive Behaviour, released in 2004, details his findings. The book is reported to have propounded a new understanding of early education of children. Narasimhan's studies in the 1960s and 70s at Illinois on computational modeling of visual behaviour is known to have proposed a new grammar for analysing the visually given image. In order to have a better understanding, his team at Illinois developed a new language by name, PAX, and the group worked on developing a hardware working on PAX to analyse the retinal image but the project was abandoned after a while. Besides several articles written in peer reviewed journals, he published two more books, between the release of Modeling Language Behaviour and Artificial Intelligence and the Study of Agentive Behaviour, released in 1998 and 2004 respectively. Both the books, Language Behaviour: Acquisition and Evolutionary History and Characterising Literacy: A Study of Western and Indian Literacy Experiences were published by Sage Publications. He was also associated with the publication of the book, The Dynamics of Technology: Creation and Diffusion of Skills and Knowledge as an editor and edited the 1993 special issue of Current Science featuring Artificial Intelligence. Awards and honours Rangaswamy Narasimhan was an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (INSA), Indian Academy of Sciences, The National Academy of Sciences, India and the Computer Society of India and held the Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship from 1971 to 1973. He received the Homi J. Bhabha Award from the University Grants Commission in 1976 and the Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1977. The Om Prakash Bhasin Award was conferred on him in 1988 and Dataquest magazine selected him for their Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994.

In addition to the Labour Code (Bulg: –ö–æ–¥–µ–∫—Å –Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–∞) from 1986 numerous detailed primary and secondary rules and regulations are applicable (Regulation for minors below the age of 15 (1986) Bulg: –ù–∞—Ä–µ–¥–±–∞ –∑–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –ª–∏—Ü–∞—Ç–∞, –Ω–µ–Ω–∞—à—ä—Ä—à–∏–ª–∏ 15-–≥–æ–¥–∏—à–Ω–∞ –≤—ä–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç; Regulation No. 4 of 1993 on the necessary documents which must accompany an employment contract –ù–∞—Ä–µ–¥–±–∞ ‚Ññ4 –∑–∞ –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ç–µ, –∫–æ–∏—Ç–æ —Å–∞ –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–∏ –∑–∞ —Å–∫–ª—é—á–≤–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–æ–≤ –¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä; Regulation No. 5 on the procedure for the registration of employment under Article 62, para.4 of the Labour Code –ù–∞—Ä–µ–¥–±–∞ ‚Ññ5 –∑–∞ —Å—ä–¥—ä—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –∏ —Ä–µ–¥–∞ –∑–∞ –∏–∑–ø—Ä–∞—â–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞ —É–≤–µ–¥–æ–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ —á–ª. 62, –∞–ª. 4 –æ—Ç –ö–æ–¥–µ–∫—Å–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–∞ etc.) Employment relationship The employment relationship is a legal relationship between an employer and an employee which regulates the rights and obligations of the parties respectively. On the one hand, the employee must perform work and comply with the established disciplinary rules in the company and the employer must, on the other hand, provide the working conditions and pay an appropriate remuneration to the employees. An employment relationship can arise only on the grounds listed in the Labour Code: employment contract, application procedure, election or administrative act. Parties to the employment relationship Those employees qualified as blue- collar workers perform physical labour, whereas the so-called white-collar workers perform intellectual work. A person must have reached a minimum age to be eligible to conclude a labour contract. Generally, the minimum required age in Bulgaria pursuant to Article 301(1) of the Labour Code is 16 years. However, due to the risk of injuries inherent in some types of work this minimum could be increased. The Bulgarian legislation provides that in certain cases the minimum age may be lower as well (for example work in the circus or arts). An identity card or birth certificate serves as proof for the age of the employee. The employer may be natural or legal person. He has the so- called advisory and disciplinary power and has the right to give instructions to the employee. His duties are principally to ensure suitable working conditions and to pay remuneration. Employment contract The employment contract is a written agreement between an employee who provides a service and another person, being an employer who provides the working conditions and compensation for the fulfillment of the employee's obligations. The legal requirements regarding the content of the employment contract are listed in Art. 66 of the Labour Code. The contract must contain: #Personal details of the parties; #Place of work; #Type of employment and description of the work activity; #Duration of the contract; #Duration of paid annual leave; #Notice period for both parties; #Completion date of the contract and the date of actual commencement of employment of the employee; #Regular daily or weekly working hours of the employee; #Basic wage. The contract must include also a description of the type of work to be performed, which is drawn up together with the employment contract. Under Art. 67(2) of the Labour Code the employment contract is usually concluded for an unlimited period. There is also a possibility for a fixed-term contracts as well. An explicit agreement between the parties is necessary in any case. The Bulgarian Labour Code provides for different types of employment agreements, including probationary period agreement (Articles 70, 71 of the Labour Code), internship agreement, bargaining agreement and training contract, employment agreement for additional work with the same employer or with another employer (Article 230-233 of the Labour Code). In order for the employment contract to be valid, it must be concluded in a written form. Remuneration The payment of remuneration is one of the main obligations of the employer and part of the obligatory content of the employment contract. The right of the employee to be paid for his wor is proclaimed in the Bulgarian Constitution of 1991. When calculating the salary of the employee, the duration of working time, intensity and quality of the work at hand must be considered. The remuneration may be calculated by two methods: *Remuneration based on the time spent in performing the employment obligations, *Performance-related remuneration‚Äîdepending on the results of the work performed. For the low- skilled employment, a minimum wage is set by the Council of Ministers. The Labour Code determines various types of additional payments (pay for overtime, for work during official holidays, for night work, etc.) Working hours Bulgarian legislation provides for the possibility for different duration of working time‚Äînormal working hours, longer working hours, shorter working hours and part-time work. The normal working hours is determined in Art. 136 of the Labour Code: the standard working day is eight hours long and the work week‚Äî40 hours. This is also the maximum period allowed under the applicable law. In accordance with Art. 136a of the Labour Code extended working hours shifts can be established in the company given that the production process requires it and provided that the legal limitations are met. The peculiarity here is that the implementation of this prolonged working shift is done by a written instruction with a legally prescribed content. The shorter working hours in accordance with Articles 137, 305, 309, 317 of the Labour Code have a duration that is shorter than the normal working hours shift. These exist due to special or hazardous working conditions on the working site or due to the age or other characteristics of the employee. The part-time work shall be performed only for part of the duration of the statutory working hours (Article 138 of the Labour Code). On the other hand, the working time can be defined also as regular working time or overtime. Normal working time coincides with the stipulated working hours in the agreement between the parties‚Äîbeing it either normal 8-hour working day, or reduced working time according to Art. 137 of the Labour Code. Overtime is present when the hours worked exceed those agreed in the contract. The overtime shall be reimbursed in accordance with Art. 262 of the Labour Code with an increase in the remuneration due. In Bulgaria, work during the night can also be performed. Night work covers the period from 22:00 until 6:00, for minor employees‚Äîfrom 20:00 to 6:00. Article 261 of the Labour Code regulates the reward for performance of night work. The working time can also be divided in actual working time (working hours, during which the worker should immediately fulfill its obligations) and being on disposal (working hours will be paid in reduced amount. Should the employee be called to perform actual work, this time is paid as overtime). Remuneration in case of overtime Overtime is regulated by Art. 143-150 of the Labour Code. This work shall be performed when instructed by the employer or with his knowledge and without his objection (Art. 143(1) Labour Code). Unless otherwise agreed, in Bulgaria an employee is not obliged to perform overtime. The overtime shall be understood as work in addition to the normal working hours (e.g. before the start or end of the workday and during lunch breaks). A regulation issued by the employer is necessary for overtime work to be conducted legally. Nevertheless, this may not be needed if the employer is aware about the fact that the employee works overtime and does not object to this fact. Important: in Bulgaria if the worker performs work outside the official working hours without the knowledge or the explicit instruction of the employer, this overtime is not regarded as overtime and no additional remuneration is due. According to the Bulgarian law overtime is permitted only in the cases provided for by the Labour code (Article 144 of the LC), namely: 1. Work performed in relation to the public security (e.g. work related to the protection of the State, crisis prevention and overcoming of its consequences or in response to urgency that serves the interests of society and the common good); 2. Work relating to emergency repair works or in ensuring safety at work; when a job needs to be completed, which cannot be carried out during working hours and thus a danger arises; when executing necessary seasonal work). In accordance with Article 146 paragraph 1 of the LC the duration of overtime in a calendar year must not exceed 150 hours within a working week‚Äî6 hours' daily work and 4 hours' night work; within a month‚Äî30 hours' daily work and 20 hours' night work as overtime. The compensation of overtime with additional holiday is forbidden. The overtime shall be paid at correspondingly higher rates that have been agreed between the parties to the employment contract (Art. 150 in conjunction with Art. 262 of the LC). Nonetheless the minimum additional payment must be as follows: *50% for work on weekdays; *75% for work on holidays; *100% for work on public holidays; *50% for work in case of summed calculation of working time. Rest During the rest period the employee is not required to perform with his work. This is a consequence of the characteristics of the rest as a time for rest, which is to serve the restoration of the work force. #The lunch time is a break during the workday (Art. 151 of the LC RF). It shall not be shorter than 30 minutes. #The rest period after the end of the working day (Art. 152 of the LC RF) shall not be less than 12 hours. #Weekly rest periods (Art. 153 of the LC RF) constitute 2 consecutive days (48 hours) in a 5-day working week. When calculated, the rest shall amount to at least 36 hours between the weekly working period. If the accumulated calculation of working time refers to shift work, the rest must not be shorter than 24 hours. #Holidays (Art. 154 of the LC) The wage during the holidays, however, must not be less than twice the usual remuneration for the particular work on these days (Art. 264 of the LC RF). Overtime on holidays shall be paid with an increased by 100% (Art. 262 para. 1 of the LC RF). Leave This is a period in which the employee may be absent from work with the consent of his employer. The leave is a legally recognized individual right of the worker. The leave is measured in working days and working hours. The Bulgarian Labour Code regulates different types of leave. First, the leave can be paid‚Äîit is an individual right of the employee and is also regarded as part of the length of service/work experience. Secondly, the leave may be unpaid‚Äîfor the usage of which the express consent of the employer is required. Peculiarity is that the unpaid leave is added to the work experience only when expressly provided for by law. Art. 160, para. 3 of the LC recognizes as work experience a period of up to 30 days a year. A further add-back takes place only in the cases provided by law. No specific work experience is required in order to claim these types of leave. Depending on the social purpose of the leaves, they vary as follows: *Regular paid annual leave, which is regulated in Art 155-156a Labour Code‚Äîa prerequisite for its use is a work experience of at least 8 months. The statutory minimum entitlement to a paid leave is 20 working days. The types of this holiday are: standard holiday (every worker has the right to it and it may not be shorter than 20 working days); extended annual leave (on a claim, for certain categories of workers and officials; its duration can be up to 30‚Äì48 days); additional leave under Article 156 LC‚Äîonly in specific cases. *Purposeful holiday ‚Äì provided in Art 157 of the LC; no specific working experience requirement. These include: leave for creative purposes‚ÄîArt 161 of the LC; leave on social grounds‚Äîtemporary incapacity, maternity, raising a child up to 2 years or up to 8 years, breast-feeding; an educational leave; holidays for the preparation of the application or admission to an educational institution, etc. Disciplinary proceedings Disciplinary measures may be imposed by the employer or another authorized by him or by law authority (Art.192 of the LC). Prior to initiating disciplinary proceedings the employer is obliged to determine the facts and gather and assess the evidence for the alleged infringement (Art. 193 of the LC). The employer is obliged to conduct consultations with the employee and give him the opportunity to comment on the accusations as well. The employer has the discretion to decide what disciplinary sanction, if any, would be appropriate in the particular case, considering certain criteria (gravity of the infringement and the circumstances which the offense was committed under; the conduct of the employee before the infringement). The criteria shall be applied cumulatively. The employee may meanwhile petition the District Court within the period prescribed by Art. 358 of the LC. In deciding the case before it, the Court will then consider the same criteria and whether they have been applied objectively. The employee cannot be sanctioned more than once for the same infringement. Disciplinary measures The sanctions are imposed on the workers, when he has infringed the company rules or labor discipline. The grounds for the imposition of such measures are enumerated in Art.186, 187 and 190 of the LC. Art. 188 provides for the different types of disciplinary sanctions (notice, warning and dismissal, the last being the gravest measure to be imposed only under exceptional circumstances and possibly without a prior notice period). The sanctions shall be imposed in writing‚Äîthrough a disciplinary order. The Bulgarian Labour Code contains stringent requirements for the content of the disciplinary order by the employer. It shall contain the reasons for the imposition of disciplinary measures and be signed by the employer. In addition, an explicit reference to the statutory provision which forms the basis for the measure shall be made. The order shall be handed personally to the employee. Provided that this proves impossible, it can be delivered by a certified post with acknowledgment of receipt. Upon signing the receipt of the letter, the order takes effect. The same applies for the deadline for lodging an appeal in accordance with Art.358 of the LC. The imposition of a disciplinary measure is limited by statutory deadlines. These are stated in Art.194 of the LC. The sanctions shall be imposed no later than two months after the discovery of the infringement and no later than one year after its commission. A special feature of the disciplinary action is the so-called elimination. An elimination of the disciplinary measure has more significance morally than legally. There are two grounds for an expiration of a disciplinary action‚Äîeither a limitation period of one year from the receipt of the order for its imposition, or by the employer in case of notice. In the second case, a written reasoned notice of the elimination of the disciplinary action is required. Liability of the parties to the employment contract The liability of the parties can be divided into 2 types‚Äîdisciplinary liability that may have been carried out by the employee, and material liability. The grounds for the imposition of disciplinary liability are enumerated in Art.187 of the Labour Code and these are violations of professional labour conduct or non-fulfillment of obligations arising from the employment relationship for the employees, such as: delay, absence from work, appearance at work in a disabled condition, non-compliance with the rules of the lawful instructions of the employer. The grounds for disciplinary dismissal are regulated in Art 190 and they envisage serious violations of the labor discipline. The material liability of the employee is governed by the provisions of Art. 203-212 of the Labour Code. The employee shall be liable with its assets, if he has culpably caused material damage to the employer while fulfilling his work obligations. These are the principles of economic and production risk. Material liability is divided into two forms‚Äîfull liability and limited liability. Full liability is incurred when the damage has been deliberately caused by a certain action or omission by the employee. This liability time, its engagement and imposition are regulated under the ordinary civil law. The applicable legal provisions regarding the limited liability can be found in Art. 203, para. 1 and 3, Art. 204-209 and Art. 210 of the Labour Code. The size of the liability is differentiated for different categories of employees: for persons on executive and managing positions‚Äîthree times the monthly remuneration; for the rest of the employees‚Äîno more than the amount of the monthly remuneration. In cases of limited liability, the employer issues an order in which he determines the basis and amount of the liability of the employee (Art. 210 of the LC). The order shall be issued within one month after discovery of the damage (but not later than one year after the induction). For executive and managing positions the periods are 3 months and 5 years accordingly. According to Art. 200 (1) of the LC the employer is liable with his assets for the damages that have led to a temporary or permanent incapacity or death of the employee. The employer is liable if an accident at work has been caused by force majeure or in fulfillment of the work commitments or during rest periods, provided the employee has not contributed himself to the accident or has caused it intentionally. The cases in which the employer is liable for damages are regulated in Art. 213-226 of the Labour Code and the amount of compensation is calculated on the basis of the gross remuneration for the last working month, unless otherwise provided (Art. 228). Termination agreement and termination of employment without notice In Bulgaria each of the parties to the employment relationship can terminate it without the observance of deadlines given that mutual consent is present. The Labour Code, and in particular Art. 325(1) p. 1-12, regulates the grounds for termination of the employment relationship. The most important ground is termination due to inability of the employee to perform his work obligations in two very specific cases‚Äîas a result of an illness or if the employment of the employee is unreasonable for health reasons. It is important to note that in these two cases, under current legislation, it is not permitted to terminate the employment contract simply because of this reason. There should be no other suitable position compatible with the health of the worker in the company, or the worker should have declined to take it. Only then the employment relationship can be terminated legally. Termination by the employee There are two ways for the employee to terminate the employment contract‚Äîthrough a proper notice that shall be given within the specified period, and extraordinary notice. In both cases this is a subjective right of the worker. According to Art. 326(2) of the Labour Code, the notice period varies depending on whether the working contract is permanent and temporary. In case of a permanent contract, the law in Bulgaria provides for a notice period of 30 days, as long as the parties have not previously agreed on a longer period (that shall not exceed 3 months). The minimum notice period for temporary contract termination is 3 months. In accordance with Art. 326(4) of the Labour Code the termination notice may be revoked by the employee simultaneously or prior to its receipt by the employer. Afterwards, a notice may be withdrawn by the end of the notice period with the consent of the employer (Art. 326(4) LC). It is possible for employees in Bulgaria to terminate the employment contract without notice as well, but only for a particular reason, as provided in Art.327 of the Labour Code. The most significant ground therein is a scenario where the employer is reluctant to pay the employee his due remuneration. Under the applicable labour law provisions even a delay of one day is sufficient for the employee to unilaterally terminate the employment relationship without complying with the usual notice periods. Termination by the employer Art 328 of the Labour Code contains a number of grounds that could form the basis for unilateral termination of the employment relationship by the employer by written letter of resignation within the time limits set in Art.326(2) of the LC, including: shutting down the enterprise; dissolution of parts of the enterprise or staff reduction; decline in the volume of work; work stoppage lasting more than 15 working days; lack of essential characteristics of the employee for the effective fulfillment of employment obligations; lack of necessary training or professional qualifications; an employee's refusal to follow the enterprise in its transfer; upon reaching age of 65 for academics, docents and doctors of science; an objective impossibility to fulfill employment obligations. Generally, the notice period in Bulgaria is 30 days, provided no agreement for a longer notice period has been reached (for a maximum of 3 months). Art. 329 of the Labour Code allows the employer to exercise the so-called suffrage (social choice) in cases of termination for partial enterprise dissolution operation, staff reduction or decrease in the volume of work. The employer may release those workers whose jobs are not subject to reduction, and retain instead employees with higher job performance level or qualifications if he deems that to be in the best interest of the enterprise. The proper conduct of these elections is a condition for the legality of the termination of the employment contract. Employers in Bulgaria can terminate the employment relationship in accordance with Art.330 para. 1 and para. 2 of the LC extraordinarily and without notice. This right arises, inter alia: during the arrest of the employee for the purpose of enforcement of a criminal conviction; when the employee is denied the right to exercise certain profession by a court or other state bodies; in withdrawing the academic degree of the employee which has been decisive for the conclusion of the employment contract; in withdrawal of the worker from the appropriate professional register (e.g. pharmacists, doctors, etc.); if the employee is released on disciplinary grounds. In Bulgaria, the employer may offer the employee to terminate the employment contract for payment of severance payment. If the employee does not accept in writing this offer within a period of 7 days, this is considered a rejection of the offer. If the worker accepts the offer, the employer is obliged to pay a compensation in the amount no less than four times his last gross monthly salary. Termination date Art.335(2) of the Labour Code provides for the following possibilities in terms of termination date. In case of termination with notice‚Äîthe date of expiry of the notice period; in case of non-compliance with the notice period‚Äîthe date of expiry of the relevant part of the notice period; in case of termination without notice‚Äîthe date of receipt of the termination order. Protection against unlawful dismissal This protection applies in cases of termination of the contract by the employer. The legal basis for protection against unlawful dismissal in Bulgaria is to be found in Art. 344-346 and 225 (concerning compensation) of the Labour Code. The dismissal is unlawful in the following circumstances: when it is not conducted on any of the statutory grounds for termination; failure to comply with the provisional protection against dismissal; if the dismissal was not announced by the employer but by unauthorized party. The protection against unlawful termination enables employees in Bulgaria to oppose to it in two ways. Art. 344 ¬ß 1 of the Labour code allows for the employee to file a lawsuit request and ask the court to declare the unlawfulness of the dismissal and cumulatively, to be recruited again at his previous workplace. The time between the entry into force of the termination order and its legal annulment is recognized as work experience. As an independent legal action and as a second option, a compensation payment may be requested within a separate court procedure. A prerequisite for that is a court decision as to the illegality of the dismissal. The amount of the compensation payment due amounts to the gross salary for the month preceding the dismissal (Art. 228(1) of the LC). The compensation payment is payable for a period of 6 months.  Deadlines and jurisdiction of the court  Under Art. 358(1)(2) of the LC the time limit for bringing a claim for unlawful dismissal is 2 months. A compensation claim can, on the other hand, be brought within a period of 3 years according to Art.358(1)(3) LC. The civil courts in Bulgaria are competent to hear the above-mentioned claims. Pursuant to Art. 359 Labour Code employees do not pay any court costs prior to the filing of the claims. Matters of jurisdiction in cases of individual employment contracts with an employer domiciled in the territory of an EU Member State are regulated by Section 5 of Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of the European Union (Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001). The provisions of the Regulation serve as a further protection for the employees by giving them the right to choose the competent court where to initiate proceedings. In this regard it is important to mention that the employer may be sued in the courts of the place where the employee habitually carries out his work or has lastly done so.

The abbey is still operating at Waasmunster, though not on its original site. Its 750-year history has not been uninterrupted. Today the focus of its spirituality is \\"Marian and Franciscan\\". History From the beginning the abbey was occupied by \\"Victorines\\" or Canonesses Regular of St. Victor who lived by the Rule of St. Augustine. In the 1970s, with the number of vocations in Flanders reducing, the Victorine community was merged with a group of Franciscan sisters, and Roosenberg should now be regarded as a Franciscan community. First site The original Roosenberg Abbey was founded in 1237-38 on the banks of the . Its establishment was mandated by , Bishop of Tournai, and it was from Tournai that the founding group of canonesses was sent. It is noted by contemporary sources that the Bishop was also inspired by Francis of Assisi whom he had evidently met in connection with the Fifth Crusade. In 1379 and 1459 the abbey was destroyed by citizens from nearby Ghent, and it was also burned down in 1419. It was destroyed during the Eighty Years' War, in 1578 by Calvinists. On each occasion it was rebuilt, however. A more final ending seemed to have been reached with the French Revolution, when the abbey property was nationalised and the buildings used as a barracks. The abbey was then destroyed (again) in 1797. By this time, however, the Abbess Anna Maria de Crombrugge, displaying remarkable prescience, had succeeded in removing and safeguarding many of the abbey's valuable manuscripts and other important documents. Second site In 1831 the abbey was re-established in a new building in Waasmunster's Church Street on the initiative of the abbess (as she became) Johanna van Doorselaer van ten Ryen (1782-1863). She used her considerable wealth to purchase several small contiguous houses which she replaced to create a new Roosenberg Abbey where she gathered surviving sisters from the old days and younger novitiates. Till 1970 Roosenberg flourished at Church Street 32 (Kerkstraat nummer 32). Third site Agreeing to the bishop's request to merge with a Franciscan community as a response to a falling-off in vocations gave rise to the need for a new site. In 1975 Roosenberg moved to its present site along the \\"Oudeheerweg-Heide\\" road. The unapologetically functional building is the work of the Benedictine architect, Hans van der Laan. The abbey is open to individuals and groups wishing to deepen their Christian belief and in search of contemplative silence.

Preciado, first published in Spanish in 2008 (Testo yonqui / Espasa Calpe), then in English in 2013 by The Feminist Press, translated by Bruce Benderson. It chronicles Preciado's multifaceted and liminal experience taking a topical testosterone called Testogel as a political and performative act, while working in Paris, France, as well as intertwining perspectives on pharmaceuticals and pornography. Outline and concept Preciado declares that Testo Junkie is a \\"body-essay\\", and writes of his use of testosterone as a way of undoing gender inscribed on the body by the capitalistic commodification and mobilization of sexuality and reproduction, a process transcendent from the social norm expected with transitioning. Testo Junkie is a homage to French writer Guillaume Dustan, a close gay friend of Preciado's who contracted AIDS and died of an accidental overdose of a medication he was taking. In the book Preciado also processes the changes in his body due to testosterone through the lens of a romantic affair with his then lover, French writer Virginie Despentes, referred to as \\"VD.\\" Sex and sexuality is a major theme in the book, as it is framed to pick up where Michel Foucault's The History of Sexuality, and the writings of Judith Butler leave off. Testo Junkie is a political history of reproductive technologies including oral contraceptive pills, Viagra, drugs used in doping, fluoxetine, and the history of clinical testosterone and estrogen usage, that connect to Preciado's own use of pharmaceuticals, among other things. Pharmacopornographic capitalism Preciado coins the term pharmacopornographic era in the book, a term based on his idea that the pharmaceutical industry, pornography industry, and late capitalism are integrated in their responsibility to the cycles of reproductive and social control through the regulation of bodies: it is framed into the micro-biological scale of design, and its place within a global political, social and economic context and strategies.

The project consisted of multiple exhibitions, seminars, reading groups, articles, and a blog. \\"1975\\" in the title refers to the year that Suriname gained independence (the independent Republic of Surinam was founded in 1975) and the Netherlands thus became to some extent \\"postcolonial\\". The project broadened SMBA‚Äôs focus, traditionally on artists based in Amsterdam, to include artists and people who were new to the city but wanted to contribute to the artistic and cultural environment. Consequently, themes that had not previously been addressed in art institutions in Amsterdam found a place to be discussed at SMBA. Many questions were raised in this project. Artists and critics responded to questions such as \\"Do colonial mindsets persist in art and in its institutions?\\".

The video programme Really Exotic focused on the notion of the exotic experience. Presented were works that could convey or tell the viewer more about this type of experience. The videoprogram was organised by Joram Kraaijeveld and Kerstin Winking (SMBA) in collaboration with Marthe Singelenberg (Filmtheater Kriterion). Time, Trade & Travel The exhibition Time, Trade & Travel took place from 25 August to 21 October 2012 and was organized in collaboration with the Nubuke Foundation, Accra, Ghana. Participating artists were: Bernard Akoi-Jackson, Dorothy Akpene Amenuke, Serge Clottey, Zachary Formwalt, Iris Kensmil, Aukje Koks, Navid Nuur, Jeremiah Quarshie, kƒÖr√Æ‚Äôk·∫°ch√§ seid√≥u, Katarina Zdjelar. It was the result of an active exchange of knowledge between artists and curators from SMBA and the Nubuke Foundation, Accra. The curators from both institutions as well as the participating artists visited each other in their work and cultural environment.Bouwhuis, Jelle, Kofi Setordji, Odile Tevie, Kerstin Winking, \\"Time, Trade & Travel\\", SMBA Newsletter No. 129, 2012. The title of this exhibition refers to the complicated aspects of international trade and traffic with their capitalist forces and influence on life and art. The participating artists in this exhibition set out to discover historical encounters between Africans and Europeans, the subsequent trade and cultual relationships that evolved from these contacts and the extent to which these cultural and economic relationships are still of influence today. The exhibition travelled on to the Nubuke Foundation in Accra, Ghana.Nubuke Foundation. Retrieved 13 July 2015.

Biography Emilio H√©ctor Rodr√≠guez was born in the colonial village of Sancti Sp√≠ritus, Cuba, in 1950. His family moved to La Habana in 1953. He started drawing and experimenting with oil paint and tempera at the age of 12. While a student at the Instituto Pre-Universitario de Marianao (Marianao Senior High School), he participated in several workshops sponsored by San Alejandro Arts Academy.

The houses were connected one by one to a single unit for the purpose of administration of the Old Town of Prague. The Old Town Hall in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is one of the city's most visited monuments. It is located in Old Town Square.  History and architecture   Foundation of the Old Town Hall  In 1338 the councillors of the Old Town bought a large patrician house from the Volflin family and adapted it for their purposes. Over the following centuries the original Town Hall building largely disappeared as a result of renovations and expansion of the building; one external remnant of the original structure still visible today is the Gothic stone portal with mouldings on the western side of the building. The burghers of the Old Town extended the original Town Hall towards the west by buying the adjoining house, and construction began of a stone tower on a square plan. The tower, which was the highest in the city in the Middle Ages, was completed in 1364, and has been largely unchanged since then. The Town Hall is architecturally unusual, because it is constructed from many different smaller houses. The expansion continued in 1458 when Mike≈° house was added to the west side. The Council Chamber in the east wing was vaulted with a net vault, supported by two pillars, at the end of the 15th century. The Gothic \\"Cock\\" house was bought in 1835 and the \\"Minute\\" house was sold to the town council for the extension of the Town Hall in 1896. Mike≈° house was rebuilt in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1879‚Äì1880, according to designs by Anton√≠n Baum. This wing was destroyed in last days of World War II during the Prague uprising. Many architectural competitions were held during the 20th century, with the intention of finding the right architectonic design for the expansion and reconstruction of the Old Town Hall, but all of the competitions either failed to produce a winner, or the winning projects were not built.  Expansion of the Old Town Hall  The architectural development of the Old Town Hall in the Middle Ages was far from completed after the completion of the tower. Construction was interrupted due to the Hussite movement (1419‚Äì1434). In 1458 another house was bought on the west side, enabling extensive modifications to the interior of the building. New halls were established in the south wing, but only the council room on the upper floor was preserved in its original appearance. Internal modifications reflected in the external reconstruction work can still be seen on the south facade. The reconstruction of the entrance hall on the ground floor of Volflin house terminated in the construction of a new portal in the Late Gothic style, the predominant style of urban architecture in the Czech Lands for over 100 years. The Gothic arch of the portal has archivolts rich in stone ornaments. Decorated brackets support the outer arch which is a typical late-Gothic ogee arch crowned by an imposing finial. The brackets on either side of the portal terminate in slender pinnacles. The main structure dates from the end of the 15th century, but the wooden double door itself dates from 1652. The window on the left of the portal was completed a few years later and retained the architectural style. The builder eschewed the traditional Gothic arch in favour of a rectangular window, adorning the thickness of the walls with panelled pilasters. A moulded stone cross divides the window into four lights, the upper two of which are decorated with the armorial bearing of the Old Town of Prague and the Czech lion. Between and slightly above them are the symbol \\"W\\", representing the royal initial of the Bohemian king Vladislaus II of Hungary (1456‚Äì1516) of the Jagiellon dynasty. Rich stone vegetable decorations adorn the top of the window. The window in the south facade dates from the 1520s, and bears traces of an early Renaissance style. The central window itself is the only original part, as the two smaller wings were added in 1731. It has a high moulded cornice with plastic ornamentation. Brackets support panelled pilasters terminating in capitals on which rests the architrave with the inscription \\"Praga caput regni\\" (Prague, the capital of the kingdom). The window is surmounted by a semicircular tympanum with the armorial bearings of the Old Town of Prague. Generally speaking the lateral windows are kept in the same style as the original Renaissance main window, but the canopies above the pilaster, in the Gothic style, are an exception. The Renaissance style is also apparent in another window situated just above the Gothic portal of the Volflin house from the 16th century. = The Council Chamber = A late Gothic door in the house adjacent to the tower serves as the main entrance to the Old Town Hall. The extensive reconstruction of the Old Town Hall at the turn of the 15th and 16th century included the erection of the east wing adjoining the north wall of the tower. A monumental building was constructed during the Late Gothic period. There was a council chamber with a net vault that gave the room an atmosphere of spaciousness. = Reconstructions = The original structure was badly damaged by modifications at the end of the 18th century, and finally disappeared completely, when during the 1840s a new wing was built in a Neo-Gothic style. The original Gothic appearance of the east wing has only been preserved in old engravings. The reconstruction also affected the historical core of the entire Town Hall complex. The interior of all three houses forming the south wing was reconstructed and Mike≈° house, the third in the row, was renovated from the outside as well. Two Neo-Gothic gables and oriel were added to the facade and the architect Gruber adjusted the entrance by adding two semi-circular arches. Further renovations in 1879 gave the facade a Neo-Renaissance appearance and two high windows were added on the second floor, one of them bearing the inscription \\"Dignitatis memores‚Äîad optima intenti\\" (Bearing in mind your dignity‚Äîdo your best) on the architrave. = The destruction by fire of the East and the North Wing = The east wing and the addition of a further north wing was carried out during the reconstruction in the 19th century. Both these wings were destroyed by fire during the Prague uprising in May 1945 and only the surviving torso adjoining the tower gives an indication of how this part of the Old Town hall looked. = The Cock = In 1835 the south wing was further extended by the addition of a fourth house, \\"the Cock house\\", bought by the Town Council that year. In this very old building the Romanesque hall from the beginning of the 13th century has been preserved, and on the first and second floor are Late- Gothic halls with Renaissance ceilings. The facade was renovated in the first half of the 19th century in Empire style. = The Minute House = At the end of the 19th century other buildings were added to the Town Hall block, including the \\"Minute\\" house, an originally Gothic house dating from the beginning of the 15th century, and decorated at the beginning of the 17th century by a series of sgraffito designs representing classical and biblical themes. Most of the later modifications affected only the interior of the house, and respected the historical exterior of the south wing.  Interior of the Old Town Hall  The Town Hall chapel in the tower, consecrated in 1381. The arrangement of the rooms is in keeping with the building's imposing exterior appearance.  The two entrance halls  The spacious entrance hall was established during reconstruction at the end of the 15th century. The Late Gothic vault adds to the impression of spaciousness of the entrance hall. There are two large mosaics on the lateral walls, created by Czech architect Vojtƒõch Ign√°c Ullmann according to designs by Mikol√°≈° Ale≈° (1936‚Äì1939). The mosaic on the western wall uses themes taken from national mythology, showing Princess Libu≈°e foretelling the glory of Prague. On the opposite wall is an allegory entitled \\"Slavdom's Homage to Prague\\". The ornaments of the vault contain coats-of-arms and symbolic depictions of great events from the nation's history. Modern renovations of the second entrance hall have modified the old architecture. There is a bronze statue by the Czech sculptor Josef V√°clav Myslbek, completed in 1885, depicting the legendary bard Lum√≠r accompanied by the allegorical figure of Song.  The first floor  The staircase leading to the first floor was designed by architect Jan Bƒõlsk√Ω (1853‚Äì1854). Here the rooms have been adapted to host wedding ceremonies. The interior is in the Late-Gothic style from the first half of the 16th century. The facade is dominated by a wide Renaissance window. The vaults are decorated with paintings by Cyril Bouda, a Czech painter and illustrator.  The third floor  The Renaissance portal on the third floor with an intersia door is from 1619. It is framed by red polished marble from the end of the 16th century. Two smooth columns with shaft-rings support an entablature with a gabled cornice containing a relief bust of the king and a cartouche with the inscription \\"Senatus\\". The portal is crowned by the armorial bearings of the Old Town flanked by allegorical figures representing Truth and Justice. The counterpart to the old portal is formed by a white marble entrance from 1945 bearing the inscription \\"Presidium\\". Through the portal is the vestibule, decorated with lunette-shaped pictures by V√°clav Bro≈æ√≠k from the second half of the 19th century.  The Session Chamber  LEGEND TO THE SECOND-FLOOR PLAN OF THE OLD TOWN HALL: 1.Entrance Hall, 2.Session Chamber, 3.Ji≈ô√≠k Hall, 4.Old Council Chamber, 5.Public Hall, 6.Town Hall Chapel, 7.Torso of destroyed East Wing All vestiges of the original architecture in the adjoining session chamber were erased during renovations in 1879‚Äì1910. The chamber is dominated by two large canvases, the work of painter V√°clav Bro≈æ√≠k. One represents Jan Hus's defence before the Council of Constance in 1415, and the second one the election of Ji≈ô√≠ of Podebrady in 1458. The adjoining Ji≈ô√≠k hall is decorated in the late-Gothic style with remnants of wall paintings dating from the end of the 15th century. Much of the historical decoration of this room was restored by architect Pavel Jan√°k between 1936 and 1938.  The Council Chamber  The old council chamber flanking the session chamber on the other side is considered one of the most beautiful rooms in the Town Hall. Though renovated many times it has preserved its original late-Gothic character dating from about 1470. The wooden coffered ceiling, polychromed in the second half of the 16th century, rests on moulded beams strengthened in 1638 by the addition of strong gilded chains. The walls are adorned by Gothic wooden panelling, a number of emblems, and the armorial bearings of the Old Town. Both entrance portals are in a late-Gothic style. The most valuable feature in the interior, however, is a wooden sculpture from the beginning of the 15th century, of Christ Suffering. It is situated on a bracket decorated with the bust of an angel and the inscription \\"Juste iudicate filii hominis\\" (Judge justly, O Sons of Man), as a warning to the councillors sitting there. The statue is in the Czech Gothic style which was at its climax at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries. The other sculptures in the old council chamber are more recent; the Madonna is from the 16th century, St. Wenceslas and St Ludmila from the 17th century and the statue of John the Baptist from the 18th century. The Baroque stove with a gilded grille and the statue of Justice date from 1736.  The Town Hall Chapel  The former public hall and the Town Hall Chapel are accessed through a metal-fitted door. The public hall, once intended for Town Council assembly sessions, was probably built in the second half of the 15th century along with the council chamber, but was completely destroyed during the fire in May 1945. The Town Hall chapel in the tower, consecrated in 1381, suffered a similar fate. Only the magnificent portal, one of the oldest preserved monuments, has survived. The semi-circular wall arch with rich mouldings is supported on slim columns terminating in Gothic pinnacles. There are emblems, often repeated, on the columns, which date from the reign of Wenceslas IV. The emblems consists of a kingfisher and the letter \\"E\\", surrounded by torse. Both the style and the personal emblems of Wenceslas indicate that the portal was built by the royal stonemasons' lodge.  The Hall of Architects  Interior of the Hall of Architects The Institute for Planning and Development of the City of Prague organized and prepared exhibitions in the Hall of Architects at the Old Town Hall and co-organized informational events in the field of architecture, urban planning and spatial planning. The exhibition hall is located on the fifth floor in the attic of the Town Hall. This space is newly refurbished and equipped with modern technology for the events. Seminars, conferences and various exhibitions are held here. The Permanent exhibition is a Model of the City of Prague from the end of the 20th century at a scale of 1:1000.  The Horologe  horologe is the most fascinating feature of the Town Hall, it was first built in the first decade of the 15th century. The horologe is the most famous feature of the Town Hall, first built in the 1400s. The first version was completed in 1410 by the clockmaker Mikul√°≈° of Kada≈à and the astronomer Jan ≈†indel. Later reconstructions changed the first design completely, but written records confirm that it already possessed all the basic features. The first extensive reconstruction was possibly carried out in 1490 by the clockmaster Jan R≈Ø≈æe (also called Hanu≈°), an old town locksmith, who produced a timepiece based on the pendulum system, though the historical accuracy of R≈Ø≈æe's contributions is disputed. The architectural decoration is also from this time, and consists of a system of slender late-Gothic columns framing the clock and rich plastic decorations of both figural and floral motifs. Jan T√°borsk√Ω of Klokotsk√° Hora repaired and perfected the clock in the years 1552‚Äì1572. Though some changes have been made since to the external appearance of the clock, its fundamental features have remained unchanged. The most recent repairs were carried out after the Second World War when the badly damaged original figures were replaced by statues by Vojtƒõch Sucharda.  The statues of the Horologe  The horologe consists of three independent units: the moving figures, the astronomical dial and the calendar dial. The figures are set in motion on the stroke of every hour by a complex mechanism.

It was led by the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army and also included the Army of Conquest \\"southern sector\\", of which the Al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham are part of, against Syrian government forces defending Daraa city and the surrounding towns. The offensive Repulsion of initial assault Map of the offensive showing the furthest extent of rebel advances Prior to 25 June 2015, Syrian government administration had been evacuated from Daraa much the same way as they had before the Second Battle of Idlib, and the Southern Storm command declared the Damascus‚ÄìDaraa road a \\"closed military zone\\" to try to stop supplies and reinforcements getting to soldiers in Daraa. The offensive, which was planned by the Free Syrian Army and involved a new \\"higher central operations room\\", began with the FSA and other rebel groups (54 in total) storming Dara‚Äôa Al-Balad District and the Al- Manasheer District of Daraa city in the early morning. Rebels also attacked the town of Ghazleh. The Syrian Army responded by dropping at least 60 barrel bombs on rebel positions. Rebels advanced towards the western entrance of Daraa and captured five checkpoints near the national hospital and Air Force Intelligence building, but were reportedly pushed back by government forces around Dara‚Äôa Al-Balad and Al-Manasheer. The rebel attack on the Damascus‚ÄìDaraa highway was also reportedly repelled. Mohammed al-Asfar, a 19-year-old Al Jazeera cameraman, was killed by shelling during fighting on 26 June. By this point, opposition activists claimed that rebel forces had made further advances, capturing the headquarters of the State Security and the Air Force Intelligence branch, which allegedly left them in control of 85% of Daraa city. However, two days later, although pro-government Al-Masdar News acknowledged that the rebels achieved some success at the town of ‚ÄòItman, north of the city, and inside the Industrial District, it stated that many of these gains had been reversed. In addition, days later, a commander who was a member of the rebel media office confirmed opposition media had exaggerated rebel gains and described the announcement that wide areas of Daraa were captured, as well as the coming of the battle days before it was launched, as \\"media chaos and publishing [of] inaccurate news\\" which the offensive's operation room could not restrain. On 27 June, the operation room of the \\"Southern Storm\\" battle was attacked by Islamist gunmen, resulting in several injuries and the withdrawal of the attacked rebel factions from the battlefield. That government troops managed to repel the major rebel assault on the provincial capital stood in stark contrast to a string of setbacks they had suffered in previous months. Interlude As of 2 July, the rebels had failed to make any significant progress. Fighting was reported in the outskirts of Itman, in an attempt to cut the Syrian Army's supply route, with the Air Force conducting airstrikes and the Damascus-Daraa highway still fully held by the Syrian Army. The following day, it was reported that the lack of advances was due to the coordination between the Southern Front and the Army of Conquest in the area being hampered by a lack of cohesion. This stemmed from the FSA's First Army refusing to align itself with the al-Nusra Front. The Southern Front's spokesman stated that they sought to exclude al-Nusra from the offensive, which in turn caused al-Nusra to respond in kind, causing problems. Attempted renewal of the offensive On 8 July, the rebels reportedly renewed their offensive. However, as of 10 July, the rebels had failed to make much headway in the face of stiff resistance by the Army, backed up by heavy air strikes on rebel positions. Aftermath On 13 August, the rebels took Tal Za'tar hill, near the western suburbs of the city, but it was reportedly recaptured by the Army the next day.

As of October 2014, the company had a revenue of $3 billion, and approximately 14,000 employees. The company is owned by Joseph Grendys.  History  The company was founded in 1973. Until 1985, it was a \\"one-room\\" chicken processing outfit with 13 employees, primarily conducting de-boning and cutting. The company began growing with the addition of feed mills and slaughterhouses. Now Koch Foods is an international poultry processor that deals in fresh and frozen offerings. The company does business under the Koch Foods, Antioch Farms, Preferred Foods, and Rogers Royal brands. It also has private label products. The company is a supplier for Burger King, Kroger and Walmart. Despite similarities in the names and the fact that both were founded by men named Fred Koch, Koch Foods has no relation to Koch Industries (founded by Fred C. Koch) or the Koch brothers; their founders are two entirely different people.  Locations  The company has facilities in the following locations: Franklin Park, Illinois; Ashland, Alabama; Gadsden, Alabama; Montgomery, Alabama; Sylacauga, Alabama; Fairfield, Ohio; Forest, Mississippi; McComb, Mississippi; Morton, Mississippi;Chattanooga, Tennessee; Morristown, Tennessee; Pine Mountain Valley, Georgia. In 2017 Koch Foods announced plans to build a $40 million feed-mill in Roanoke, Alabama. In 2019 Koch Foods announced that Roanoke, Alabama was no longer the target location for this feed-mill. Instead, Koch Foods announced plans to build a modern grain storage and distribution facility in Attalla, Alabama.  Controversies  Racial discrimination against farmers Koch has been accused of discriminating against black contract farmers and retaliating against those who spoke out. From 2009 to 2015, the company went from having contracts with four black farmers in Mississippi to having none. USDA investigators found \\"evidence of unjust discrimination\\" against black farmers by Koch.  U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lawsuit  In 2012 the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brought a class employment discrimination lawsuit against Koch alleging harassment of workers and discrimination based on national origin and race at Koch's Morton, Mississippi plant. The lawsuit alleged that workers were ‚Äúsubjected to touching and sexually suggestive comments, were hit, were charged money for normal everyday work activities‚Äù among other things. In 2018 Koch Foods paid $3,750,000 plus other relief to settle the case.  Use of undocumented labor  On August 28, 2007, federal authorities raided a chicken processing plant operated by Koch Foods in Fairfield, Ohio and detained 161 undocumented workers. Following the raid, and subsequent investigation, Koch Foods paid a fine on February 12, 2010 of $536,046 for violating federal immigration law. According to a 2010 ICE press release, the company cooperated and began using E-Verify, an Internet-based system that allows an employer to verify a person's work eligibility. On August 7, 2019, federal authorities raided seven chicken processing plants operated by Koch Foods and four other companies in Mississippi and detained 680 undocumented workers. The exact number arrested at the Koch facilities has not been specified but authorities used five buses to transfer detainees from the plant to a hangar at a nearby airbase for processing. Homeland Security Investigations has faced criticism because the raid occurred on Mississippi's first day of school. According to the mayor of Jackson, no managers or owners responsible for hiring unauthorized immigrants in such high numbers were charged. The company announced a job fair to be held on the first day of the week following the raids.

But he was free to come and go, and he could leave when he was not treated politely or when he disapproved of the behavior of his host.Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.129.  The historical development  The practice of keeping retainers can be traced back to the Warring States period (ca. 476-221 BCE). Ancient Chinese social structure was changing during this time, the system of feudal states created by the Western Zhou dynasty underwent enormous changes after 771 BCE with the flight of the Zhou court to Chengzhou (modern- day Luoyang) and the diminution of the court's relevance and power.Scott Cook (2010): \\"'San De' and Warring States Views on Heavenly Retribution.\\" Journal of Chinese Philosophy, no.37 (2010), pp.101-123. The sovereign (king of Zhou) was merely a figurehead and the social hierarchy which formerly had depended on blood-relationship to the king of the Zhou was severely impacted by the move.Bao JiashuÈ≤çÂÆ∂Ê†ë (2010): Journal of Hainan Normal University, p.142. The Spring and Autumn period led to a few states gaining power at the expense of many others, the latter no longer able to depend on central authority for legitimacy or protection. During the Warring States period, many rulers claimed the Mandate of Heaven to justify their conquest of other states and spread their influence.S. Cook (2010), p.102. The number of retainers one was able to keep seems to have been a status symbol, and keeping retainers also served as a means to augment political power.Shiji Âè≤Ë®ò (by Sima QianÂè∏È¶¨ÈÅ∑ [ca. 145-86 BCE] et al., Baina edition, 1931, 77:1a; cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.128. A retainer could with his own ability and efforts acquire benefits and improve his social status.Bao JiashuÈ≤çÂÆ∂Ê†ë (2010), p.142. Therefore, there were lots of noblemen keeping retainers, and some of them kept a maximum of about three thousand retainers. This pre-Qin practice of keeping retainers was continued in Qin times (BCE 221-207). Li Si ÊùéÊñØ (BCE 280-208), the imperial chancellor, and Zhao Gao ËµµÈ´ò, the powerful eunuch, each kept a number of retainers.Sanguo Zhi‰∏âÂúãÂøó [Records of the Three Kingdom] (by Chen Shou Èô≥Â£Ω [ca. 233-297 BCE] et al.), Baina edition,1931, Wei, 12:20b, 18:1a, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.130. Having retainers was still very popular in Han times, the largest number of retainers reported for the Han was ca. one thousand.HanshuÊº¢Êõ∏ (by Ban Gu Áè≠Âõ∫ [32-92 BCE] et al.), Baina edition, 1931, 34:24a, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972) p.130. Under the protection of a powerful master a retainer usually was able to avoid the payment of taxes. Furthermore, the government had difficulty in levying labor and military service from the retainers of powerful person. Under the protection of a master some guests engaged I robbery, murder, and other unlawful activities.Hanshu 86:2a, cited in Jack L. Dull (1972), p.131. It seems that there developed a sort of patron-client relationship. The host became more demanding and arrogant, while the retainers became more subservient.Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.131. The number of retainers kept by a host again increased in the era of the Three Kingdoms (220-280 CE). There were two instances of men who kept more than a thousand retainers. This sudden increase is understandable: during the wars and disturbed periods of the Later Han and thereafter, every powerful person was ambitious to use his strength to acquire political power and tended to keep a large number of retainers who actually were his personal troops.Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972)., p.130. From the end of the Early Han the retainers began to participate in production, particularly in the cultivation of land. This tendency was more dominant at the end of the Later Han and in the years of the Three Kingdoms. For example, a provincial governor sent ten of his retainers to build a house and plant orange trees. The family derived a profit worth several thousand rolls of silk from the produce yearly and became wealthy. They actually became tenants, who paid labor and earned remunerations.Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.132.  The role of the host  The host was expected to provide lodging, food, clothing and even carriages for his retainers and to treat them generously. Some of the most honored retainers were even given luxurious articles such as pearls and jade.Shiji 78:7b, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972) Obviously only the wealthy nobles and officials could afford to support a large number of retainers. Prince Tian Wen Áî∞Êñá (?-279 BCE) of Qi (state)ÈΩê, Prince Zhao Sheng Ë∂ôÂãù (?- 251 BCE) of Zhao (state) Ë∂ô, Prince Wei Wuji È≠èÁÑ°Âøå (?-243 BCE) of Wei, and Chancellor Huang Xie ÈªÑÊ≠á (?-238 BCE) of the State of Chu (state), all tried to have more and more retainers.Shiji 78:7b, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.127. A prince with such an enormous number of retainers under his command usually was powerful enough to control his own state. Sometimes a state did not even dare to fight with a neighboring state because the ruler had thousands of retainers.Shiji p.77:1a, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.128. While the number of retainers kept by a master could be enormous, they must have varied greatly in personality and qualification; and of course their selection depended heavily on the attitudes and disposition of the patron.Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.130.  The social status of retainers  In the pre-Qin time, the social status of a retainer was not an inferior one. A master, though much superior in political and social status as well as in wealth, had to treat his retainers politely. But guests did not all have the same status, nor were they all treated the same. As a rule, those who engaged in humble occupation and were looked down upon by society were also held in less respect as retainers. A man without special ability was also considered inferior by his master and his fellow retainers.Shiji 76:2b, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.129. The status of retainers in the Later Han, and especially in the era of the Three Kingdoms, was markedly inferior; retainers were asked to engage in productive and menial labor and were treated more like slaves or servants.Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p134.  The function of retainers  In pre-Qin times, the retainer seldom had definite obligations, and usually no routine work was assigned to him. He was expected to render occasional service according to his abilities when there was such a demand. When Prince Tian Wen Áî∞Êñá wanted to send someone to collect his debts, he inquired of his retainers whether one of them was versed in accounting and competent for his job.Shiji 75:8b-9a, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.129. Sometimes the mission was difficult or even dangerous. A retainer was expected to do what the master asked of him and even risk his life for him. Hundreds of retainers were ready to give up their lives to follow Prince Wei Wuji È≠èÁÑ°Âøå.Shiji 87:3b-5a, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.127. In Han times, retainers served in various capacities. They were intelligent men who served as personal advisors to high officials.Hanshu 52:2b-3a, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.131. Others were engaged in physical and menial work. Some retainers served as bodyguards.Sanguozhi, Wei, 11:9 a-b, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.130. It was not uncommon to ask a retainer to assassinate an enemy.Hanshu 84:2b, cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972) , p. 130 Under unusual conditions retainers were even asked to engage in robbery and other unlawful activities.Hanshu 47:5a, 86:2a. cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p. As a rule, retainers were expected to share the suffering of their master and offer help in times of emergency or danger. Retainers also had obligations to defend the family of their master when it was attacked by bandits or enemies.Hou Hanshu ÂæåÊº¢Êõ∏ (by Fan YeËåÉÊõÑ [ca. 398-445 BCE] et al., Baina edition, 1931, 33:12a. cited in Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p. 151. The military services of retainers obviously were a help in seeking military and political power.Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.132. Retainers were usually not asked to perform domestic or productive work in the pre-Qin through early Han periods, but from the end of the early Han the retainers participated in production, particularly in the cultivation of land, and this tendency was more dominant at the end of Later Han and Three Kingdoms (220-280 CE) periods. During this time, retainers were treated in the same manner as slaves, and slaves and retainers were expected to perform the same kind of menial work.Ch'√º T'ung-tsu (1972), p.134.  Famous retainers in history  Sun Bin Â≠´Ëáè, the famous retainer in the residence of Tian Ji Áî∞Âøå in the Warring States period. Once, King Wei of Qi invited Tian Ji to a horse racing competition. Sun Bin suggested a strategy to Tian Ji to utilize his horses to the best advantage, and Tian won two out of three rounds in the race. The king was impressed with Tian's victory. Tian admitted that he won with the help of Sun Bin, and recommended Sun's talents to the king. King Wei wanted to appoint Sun Bin as the commander of the Qi armies. Sun declined, as his handicap prevented him from riding horseback, and would have a negative effect on the morale of soldiers. Sun was then appointed chief military advisor instead and served as Tian Ji's deputy.Shiji: Chapter 65, Sun Bin, as of 24 Jun 2015 Literature *Editorial Committee of Encyclopedia of China‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ§ßÁôæÁßëÂÖ®‰π¶ÁºñÂßî‰ºö(1986): Zhonguo Dabaike Quanshu‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ§ßÁôæÁßëÂÖ®‰π¶Encyclopedia of China.

Memory institutions use LIDO for ‚Äúexposing, sharing and connecting data on the web‚Äù. It can be applied to all kind of disciplines in cultural heritage, e.g. art, natural history, technology, etc. LIDO is a specific application of CIDOC CRM.  Background  Digital descriptions of pieces of cultural heritage consist of several parts. These encompass at least textual cataloging information as well as one or more digital surrogates, e.g. a photograph or a 3D scan. Access to this information is effected by the means of metadata records, which provide not only information about the object described (e.g. a painting‚Äôs title or the date of its creation) but also contain information about the data record itself (e.g. by whom it has been created and when). LIDO provides an XML based schema for these types of information and serves as common ground for sharing metadata. It enables web portals to integrate information from different organizations (like museums or collections) in a standardized format. Hereby it simplifies the dissemination of data. LIDO is used e.g. by the German Digital Library, Europeana and the Yale Center for British Art at Yale University.  History  Organizations creating digital records oftentimes use their own formats for storing information in their collections. This makes sharing their data difficult: Websites like Europeana that combine information from different sources and provide them on a single platform face the challenge of integrating heterogeneous data formats. The web portal owner has to write a crosswalk for each external metadata format which is both costly and time- consuming. As a result, data might not get the exposure it could since the web portal might not have the resources to create and maintain the crosswalks. To avoid this situation international experts developed LIDO as a harvesting standard. It roots in CDWA Lite by the J. Paul Getty Trust, museumdat by the German Museums Association, and SPECTRUM XML Schema by the UK Collections Trust. It is a specific application of CIDOC CRM. While work on LIDO started in 2008, its first version has been released during the ICOM/CIDOC conference in Shanghai in 2010. LIDO is continuously refined by cultural heritage experts.  Principles  As an XML schema LIDO is strictly hierarchical. It summarizes each chunk of information about an object in a set encapsulated by a wrapper element, e.g.: Chickens and Ducks LIDO provides descriptive as well as administrative information about an object. The descriptive part includes (among others): * classificatory information (sort of object, genre, shape, ...) * identificatory information (name, inscriptions, measurements, description of the object, ...) * events in the object‚Äôs history (creation, production, restoration, acquisition, loss, persons/places/objects involved in the event, ‚Ä¶) * connection to other entities (concepts, persons/places/objects involved, ‚Ä¶) The administrative part provides (again, among others) details about: * rights associated with the object * information about the record itself (ID, format, provenance, license‚Ä¶) * information about the digital resource (link to the record, linked pages, ‚Ä¶) LIDO also differentiates between information users see on a website (display information) and information used for searching and retrieval (indexing information). A core concept of LIDO is modelling an object‚Äôs history according to the events in which it was involved. This concept has its source in CIDOC CRM and provides an opportunity to gain new insights about the object or persons involved: > \\"This event-centric approach [of CIDOC CRM] makes it possible to map the > properties of an object with references to the actors involved, to location, > and time more precisely. Thus, it supports the (automatic) uncovering of > correlations between originally scattered information and it contributes to > the contextualization of objects.‚Äù LIDO also provides the possibility to connect data with authority files. This essentially facilitates a subsequent publication as Linked Data, thereby contributing to the Semantic Web.  LIDO terminology  The LIDO Terminology is a complement to the current LIDO v1.0 specification. Its main purpose it to define controlled vocabularies for certain LIDO elements and attributes which are made referenceable through a URI. Thereby the LIDO Terminology is committed to Linked Open Data and increases the interoperability of LIDO records.  Relationship to CIDOC CRM  CIDOC CRM is an object-oriented and extensible ontology. It defines concepts and relationships that are necessary for the description of cultural heritage objects. Being an ontology, CIDOC CRM is based on formal logic and graph oriented. LIDO, on the other hand, is a specific XML based application of CIDOC CRM. It has been developed for harvesting metadata. Other than CIDOC CRM LIDO is a schema and thereby strictly hierarchic. It adopts aspects of its predecessor, CDWA, but heavily relies on CIDOC CRM's classes, e.g. E5 Event, E39 Actor, E55 Type. LIDO tools A few tools are available for handling LIDO: * OAICatMuseum by OCLC Research allows publication of museum data as LIDO or CDWA, using the OAI-PMH protocol * MINT is a general tool for metadata mapping developed by National Technical University of Athens that is often used by Europeana-related projects. It can map to EDM or LIDO * LIBIS has created a LIDO profile for the CollectiveAccess open source Collection Management System. This allows museums to catalog objects directly in LIDO. While LIDO is not a fully-fledged museum Collection Management schema (e.g. like SPECTRUM by the Collections Trust), it is quite sufficient for most collections.

Even though they are considered introns, which are typically cut out of pre mRNA sequences, there are significant problems that arise when exitrons are spliced out of these strands, with the most obvious result being altered protein structures and functions. They were first discovered in plants, but have recently been found in other metazoan species as well.  Alternative splicing  Exitrons are a result of alternative splicing (AS), in which introns are typically cut out of a pre mRNA sequence, while exons remain in the sequence and are translated into proteins. The same sequence within a pre mRNA strand can be considered an intron or exon depending on the desired protein to be produced. As a result, different final mRNA sequences are generated and a large variety of proteins can be made from one single gene.1. Alberts, B., Johnson, A., Lewis, J., Morgan, D., Raff, M., Roberts, K., Walter, P. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 6. New York: Garland Science; 2015. p. 319-320, 415. Mutations that exist in these sequences can also alter the way in which a sequence is spliced and as a result, change the protein produced.2. Edwalds-Gilbert, G. Regulation of mRNA Splicing by Signal Transduction. [Internet]. Scitable.; [cited 2016 Feb 15]. Available from http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/regulation-of-mrna-splicing-by- signal-transduction-14128469 Splicing mutations of a mRNA sequence has been found to account for 15-60% of human genetic diseases, which suggests there may be a crucial role of exitrons in organ homeostasis.3. Wang, G. S., Cooper, T. A. Splicing in disease: disruption of the splicing code and the decoding machinery. Nat Rev Genet. 2007;8(10): 749-761.4.  Discovery  A previous study had looked at alternative splicing in Rockcress (Arabidopsis) plants and pinpointed characteristics of retained introns in sequences. They had a subset of what they called \\"cryptic introns\\" that did not contain stop codons and are now deemed exitrons. They had a subset of what they called \\"cryptic introns\\" that did not contain stop codons and are now deemed exitrons. The same researchers conducted further studies on their newly discovered exitrons and found 1002 exitrons in 892 Rockcress genes, a flowering plant that has been used to model exitrons. Although they were discovered in plants, exitrons have also been found in other metazoan species and humans as well.5. Staiger, D., Simpson, G. G. Enter exitrons. [Internet]. BioMed Central.; [cited 2016 Feb 15]. Available from http://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0704-3  Distinguishing these regions from typical introns  Transcripts with exitrons in their sequences can be distinguished from those with retained introns in three ways. First, transcripts containing exitrons are transported out of the nucleus to be translated, whereas those containing introns are identified as incompletely processed and are kept in the nucleus where they cannot be translated. Second, only transcripts with exitrons of lengths not divisible by three have the potential to incorporate premature termination sequences, while sequences with introns normally result in premature termination. Third, exitron transcripts are usually the major isoform, but those with introns are only present in small amounts.  Characteristics  Exitrons are considered introns, but have characteristics of both introns and exons. They originated from ancestral coding exons, but have weaker splice site signals than other introns. Exitrons have been found to be longer and have a higher GC content than intron regions and constitutive introns. However, they are of similar size to constitutive exons and their GC content is lower compared to other exons. Exitrons lack stop codons within their sequences, have synonymous substitutions, and are most commonly found in multiples of three nucleotides. Exitron sequences contain sites for numerous post-translational modifications, including sumoylation, ubiquitylation, S-nitrosylation, and lysine acetylation. The ability of exitron splicing (EIS) to alter protein states demonstrates the effect it can have on proteome assortment.  In Arabidopsis  Exitron splicing affects 3.3% of Arabidopsis protein coding genes. 11% of intron regions were composed of exitrons and 3.7% of AS events detected in a sample were exitron splicings. The regulation of EIS in tissues is controlled by certain stresses, which serves as a regulatory role in plant adaptation and development.  Effects  Exitron splicing has been found to be a conserved strategy for increasing proteome plasticity in both plants and animals since it affects plant and human protein features in a similar manner. When exitrons are spliced out of a sequence, it has resulted in internally deleted proteins and affected protein domains, disordered regions, and various post- translational modification sites that impact protein function. Spliced exitrons can result in premature termination of a protein, while in contrast, a non-spliced exitron results in a full-length protein. The processing of these exitrons has been found to be sensitive to cell types and environmental conditions and their splicing is linked to cancer.6. MEMBS E-News. Exitron Splicing: New Aspect of Gene Regulation. [Internet]. Middle East Molecular Biology Society.; [cited 2016 Feb 15]. Available from http://enews.membs.org/Exitron-Splicing--New-Aspect-of-Gene-Regulation The impairment of EIS can potentially contribute to the initiation of cancer formation through its effect on several cancer related genes. These genes include cancer marker genes and genes involved in cell adhesion, migration, and metastasis.

Plot summary Kip Kayle, a thief, accidentally gets involved in a quest to restore the Rod of Seven Parts, and as the quest progresses it leads to a vast cosmic battle between the forces of Law and Chaos.http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7869-0479-2 Reception Trenton Webb reviewed The Rod of Seven Parts for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. He commented that \\"The Rod Of Seven Parts doesn't even pretend to be a 'proper' book; glibly ignoring such trifling conventions as characterisation, pacing and structure. It's a work of reportage that (almost too) accurately recreates the feel of an actual game in play which - as a teaser for the forthcoming campaign based on the 'legendary' artifact - is exactly what it should be.\\" He continued by saying \\"The story starts with a furious duel between a Wind Duke and Lycosyd, and from that moment on, the pace is unrelenting. This speed of delivery helps paper over a few cracks. The characters are functional class/race archetypes, while their dialogue has the air of 'real' conversations culled from players under pressure, rather than being considered character-developing speech. The plot pushes everything on at such a rate that many questions are left unanswered.\\" Webb went on to say that \\"The resolution of cliffhangers is often illogical and regularly beyond the control of the central cast. All their escapes seem plausible at first, but on reflection are increasingly dissatisfying, Yet somehow the sensation of gamers at play surfaces, because when logic falls foul of fun, the characters (players?) are winging it. Such 'amateurish' elements should both damn the book to the same plane of hell as the main villain Miska; but don't.\\" He added, \\"The mix of monsters is right, escalating from ogres through to top- notch tannari. The setting continually changes, moving swiftly from the familiar dungeon environment through city streets to the planes of Pandemonium. There are big heroes and big villains. And you get to meet and fight them both.\\" Webb concludes the review by saying, \\"The flaws restrict rather than cripple The Rod Of Seven Parts, (even though the way it handles laws regarding alignment is extremely annoying). Aimed at a hard-core D&D; audience, it's an enjoyable tale told with enough raw enthusiasm to maintain the 'live and direct from the tabletop' feel.
