Following a high-profile but unsuccessful run for the 2016 Auckland mayoral election, she became a parliamentary candidate for the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, standing in the 2017 New Zealand general election and was elected as a member of the New Zealand Parliament at the age of 23. In the 2020 election, Swarbrick was elected as the Member of Parliament for Auckland Central, becoming the second Green Party MP to win an electorate seat in the history of the party. Swarbrick is Green Party Spokesperson for Mental Health, Drug Law Reform, Education, Arts and Heritage, Tertiary Education, Small Business, Broadcasting, Youth and Local Government. Early life Swarbrick was born in Auckland in 1994, and went to Epsom Girls' Grammar School. Her parents separated when she was young and she lived with her mother in the UK for six months and then with her father for 18 months in Papua New Guinea. She said her father taught her how to formulate an argument when she was practising her first speech at age seven. During high school she spent a week at a time with each parent. She entered the University of Auckland at age 17, and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. She says she did not want to be a lawyer but wanted to know \\"how our system runs... I had to go to law school to learn about the Treaty of Waitangi.\\" Career In 2012, Swarbrick opened her first business, a New Zealand-made fashion label called The Lucid Collective, with Alex Bartley Catt. Around the same time, she began working in the newsroom at the student radio station 95bFM as a news writer and news reader, before becoming a producer and eventually host of The Wire. In April 2016, she resigned from her position as a regular host. In 2014, Swarbrick wrote her first piece for What's Good magazine. She became editor, and an owner. Later that year, The Lucid Collective held a New Zealand Fashion Week side-show at the Gow Langsford Gallery and participated in the \\"Youthquake\\" exhibition at the New Zealand Fashion Museum. The label went on to be stocked across Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch, before Swarbrick and Bartley Catt closed the business. Swarbrick launched The Goods, an offshoot of What's Good, in late 2015. The project opened a pop-up store in St Kevin's Arcade on Karangahape Road. Swarbrick won a New Zealander of the Year Local Hero Award. In 2016, Swarbrick and Bartley Catt started a digital consultancy and artist management agency called TIPS. The pair also opened a cafe and gallery, Olly, now listed permanently closed, next to the Crystal Palace theatre in Mount Eden. In May 2019, Swarbrick received the Jane Goodall Trailblazer Award. The award recognises individuals who have demonstrated dedication to the prosperity of animals, people, or the planet through their work. In 2020, Swarbrick was named to Fortune magazine's '40 Under 40' listing under the \\"Government and Politics\\" category. In August 2020, a short documentary film named Ok Chl√∂e was released about the background of Swarbrick and her political career. Political career Swarbrick ran in the 2016 Auckland mayoral election, coming in third place, with 29,098 votes‚Äîalmost 160,000 votes behind the winner, Phil Goff.\\"Chloe Swarbrick 'hoped for better'\\", Newshub, NZ, 8 October 2016. Retrieved on 7 January 2017. In 2016 as a mayoral candidate, she gave a speech at a human blockade (organised by Auckland Peace Action) that briefly interrupted a New Zealand Defence Industry Association Forum. Swarbrick said she entered the mayoral race as a form of protest after interviewing ‚Äúuninspiring‚Äù potential candidates while working as a journalist for bFM and discovering that only 34% of the electorate had voted at the previous mayoral election.The Art of Coffee and Politics, Verve Swarbrick gained significant media attention largely due to her age. After losing the mayoral race, she joined the Green Party. Soon after joining the Green Party, Swarbrick announced she would challenge sitting Green MP Denise Roche as the party's candidate in the Auckland Central electorate for the 2017 general election. Her challenge was unsuccessful, as the local branch selected Denise Roche to stand in the seat again. Swarbrick was selected instead to stand for the Maungakiekie electorate, and placed 7th on the party list. She is the youngest politician to enter Parliament in New Zealand since Marilyn Waring in 1975. =Parliamentary career=  Election access  After the 2017 general election, Swarbrick lodged the Election Access Fund Bill (a member's bill originally drafted by Mojo Mathers) in the members ballot and in February 2018 this bill was drawn from the ballot. This piece of legislation aims to \\"establish an Election Access Fund to be administered by the Electoral Commission and used by any disabled candidate to cover disability-related costs of standing in a general election, by not-for-profit bodies to cover costs of making election education events and materials accessible, and by registered political parties to support access needs of any members to allow them to participate within the party.\\" The Bill passed its first reading in May 2018 with unanimous support. It passed its second reading in December 2019, and its third reading in March 2020. The unanimous passing of the Bill is particularly significant, as it is the first Green Party Bill to achieve this.  Drug reform  Swarbrick also inherited the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis and Other Matters) Amendment Bill from fellow Green Party MP Julie Anne Genter. Swarbrick gained endorsements from former Prime Minister Helen Clark and Grey Power for this piece of legislation. This Bill was however voted down in January 2018. Swarbrick has since negotiated changes to David Clark's Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Act including the inclusion of local native strains of cannabis in New Zealand and a guarantee that the medicinal cannabis regulations this bill empowers be made public and functioning within a year. She is also a staunch campaigner for the legalisation of recreational cannabis. Swarbrick took on the Green Party's Drug Law Reform portfolio in January 2018. In response to New Zealand's synthetics crisis and more than 50 associated deaths, Swarbrick launched a campaign for an end to the criminalisation of drug users and addicts. Within the government's Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill, Swarbrick negotiated a formalisation of police discretion that requires police 'should not' prosecute unless it is in the public interest and the user would benefit from a therapeutic approach. During 2018, Swarbrick worked with other MPs across parliament to form a Cross-Party Group on Drug Harm Reduction, she repeatedly called on the New Zealand National Party to join this group. In response to a call from National MP Matt Doocey for cross party work on mental health, Swarbrick proposed creating a group merging the Cross-Party Group on Drug Harm Reduction and a mental health group, in August 2019, this group, the Cross- Party Group on Mental Health and Addictions was launched, with members from every party in Parliament. From the starting point of a parliament disagreeing on how to implement medicinal cannabis, Swarbrick has worked to establish a progressive medicinal cannabis regulatory regime. The regime allows local cannabis strains to be registered in New Zealand, and removes barriers to legal and high-value careers for people with former cannabis convictions. In 2018, Swarbrick launched the political podcast 'Authorised By' with Kiri Allan.  Mental health  Swarbrick fought to secure and retain security for community mental health services. In particular, she obtained extensions to funding for Te Whare Mahana Trust in Golden Bay and Te Kuwatawata in the Gisborne region. Swarbrick also worked to establish and expand the Piki pilot programme, which provides young people aged 18‚Äì25 with free mental health support.  Climate emergency  In May 2019 Swarbrick attempted to obtain unanimous leave to pass a motion to declare a climate change emergency. This was unsuccessful due to the National Party's opposition to it.  Fossil fuel divestment  Swarbrick has advocated for a mandate requiring public funds to divest from fossil fuels. She secured a public briefing into ACC, which has nearly $1 billion invested into fossil fuels. Swarbrick has publicly challenged the Minister of Finance to use his discretion under the Crown Entities Act to ensure public entities do the right thing and take \\"action to prevent a climate crisis\\". Her Member's Bill which directs the Government to shift away from fossil fuel investment, currently sits in the ballot.  \\"OK boomer\\"  In November 2019 Swarbrick responded to then opposition spokesperson for climate change, Todd Muller with the phrase \\"OK boomer\\" after he interrupted her speech on climate change. Swarbrick was commenting on the Zero Carbon bill, which aims to reduce net carbon emissions in New Zealand to zero by 2050, when she used the phrase. Although there was little reaction to her comment in Parliament, her two-word throwaway remark became a talking point in media around the world.The world is obsessed with Chl√∂e Swarbrick's 'OK, boomer' jibe, Stuff, 9 November 2019 Writing in The Guardian, she said: \\"My 'OK boomer' comment in parliament was off-the-cuff, albeit symbolic of the collective exhaustion of multiple generations.\\"  Education work  During New Zealand's COVID-19 response, the government released a tertiary support package. This package was considered unhelpful by students and student associations. In addition, several university halls of residence continued to charge students who left their accommodation during the nation-wide lockdown, to isolate elsewhere. Swarbrick maintained her support of students and called for universities to \\"do the right thing\\" and stop these charges. Her attention to the issue has seen some universities delay these charges. Other universities have completely waived fees for unused accommodation. Swarbrick's advocacy on behalf of students exposed a deeply underregulated sector. Swarbrick worked to obtain cross-party support to launch an Inquiry into student accommodation. Submissions for this opened on 4 June 2020. 2020 general election During the 2020 New Zealand general election, Swarbrick contested and won the Auckland Central electorate, which had previously been held by retiring National MP Nikki Kaye. Based on preliminary results, Swarbrick won Auckland Central with 9,060 votes, with Labour's Helen White coming second at 8,568 and National's Emma Mellow coming third at 7,566. She becomes the second Green MP to have won an electorate in 21 years after former Greens Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons won Coromandel in 1999. Personal life On the topic of her sexuality, Swarbrick has said she \\"likes people\\", refusing to give a label. She says she did not come out of the closet because she was never in the closet, echoing sentiment from a conversation she had with Scottish MP Mhairi Black. In January 2020 it was reported that Swarbrick had been engaged to Nadine Walker for several months, but that they had remained private about their relationship. Swarbrick has referred to herself as queer in the past. OK Chl√∂e OK Chl√∂e Poster OK Chl√∂e is a short documentary film directed by Charlotte Evans and produced by Letisha Tate-Dunning. The film premiered online as part of the seventh season of \\"Loading Docs\\". The documentary is about the political career of Swarbrick. The title \\"OK Chl√∂e\\" is based on the saying \\"OK Boomer\\", which is a phrase that Swarbrick said during a parliamentary speech in reply to a heckle from a National Party MP. The reply became viral.The film is about the full story of Swarbrick as she goes into details about both her personal life and professional life as a politician. She talks about her work in legalising cannabis leading into the 2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum. It talks about how she feels being in the New Zealand Parliament, saying \\"Parliament is a toxic culture that chews people up and spits them out. You become inhuman and disconnected from the people you purport to represent.\\" The film also talks about her background, from her personal life with her being adopted, struggles with mental health and coming out as bisexual, to her running for Auckland Mayor. After the release of the documentary, John Campbell questioned Chloe on some of the statements said on the documentary.

She is best known for her feminist anti-war play, War Brides, which was made into a silent film starring Alla Nazimova in 1916. Early life and education She was born in Minnesota in 1872 and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1894. She later studied at the Curry School of Expression (now Curry College), and stayed on in Boston to teach expression. She married in 1900, had a son, and divorced in 1912. Career Wentworth was a socialist and a feminist whose writing often addressed social issues. Her 1912 play, The Flower Shop, takes up the cause of women's suffrage. In the years leading up to World War I, she traveled the country to raise support for the suffrage movement by giving dramatic readings. She often read from Votes for Women!, a pro-suffrage play by Elizabeth Robins, portraying multiple characters that ranged from \\"the doughty women's trade union leader with the cockney dialect\\" to \\"the bright, little, pertinacious middle-class 'Suffragette,' with her high-pitched volubility on the platform\\". In April 1908 she was featured on the cover of The Socialist Woman, a magazine edited by Josephine Conger-Kaneko, who considered her \\"among the best women artists of the Socialist movement.\\" In addition to readings, she also gave lectures. In March 1915 she addressed a meeting of the Boston Equal Suffrage Association for Good Government; the other speakers were Julia Lathrop, director of the U.S. Children's Bureau, and Boston NAACP president Butler R. Wilson. =War Brides= In 1915 Wentworth published her best known play, War Brides, in which a pregnant war widow commits suicide rather than bear more children for a nation that allows her no say in its decision-making. At one point she confronts an army captain, arguing, > You tear our husbands, our sons from us‚Äîyou never ask us to help you find a > better way‚Äîand haven't we anything to say?...If we can bring forth the men > for the nation, we can sit with you in your councils and shape the destiny > of the nation, and say whether it is to war or peace we give the sons we > bear. The dedication reads, \\"To my little boy Brandon.\\" War Brides was one of the most successful plays of 1915. It opened in January at B.F. Keith's Palace Theatre in New York City, with Alla Nazimova in the lead role, and toured the country for several months. The play was so much in demand that a second production toured the South, with Gilda Varesi in the lead. In 1916 the play was made into a silent film, War Brides, starring Nazimova in her first onscreen role. The film did very well in the United States, bringing the studios a profit of $300,000, and was widely acclaimed by critics. Because of its pacifist message, it was banned in some cities and states. In 1917 it was withdrawn from circulation on the grounds that \\"The philosophy of this picture is so easily misunderstood by unthinking people\\". Later that year the producer, Lewis Selznick, had the film edited to give it an anti-German slant, and re-released it to American theaters. It was not shown in any other Allied countries. Later years Wentworth published several more plays and a collection of poems, Iridescent Days. In her later years she did a great deal of traveling, which is reflected in her poetry. She died in 1942.

Five were produced and were used by German airlines until about 1928. Design and development The first Udet passenger transport was the two-passenger U 5, which appeared in 1923. This was powered by a , seven- cylinder, Siemens-Halske Sh 5 radial engine. The following year Udet produced the first U 8, which had a nine-cylinder, Siemens-Halske Sh 6 radial, making it rather heavier than the U 5 but leaving the design only slightly changed and the dimensions unaltered. The new engine allowed the U 8 to carry three passengers. The cantilever, one-piece parasol wing of the U.8 was trapezoidal in plan, with long, elliptical tips. It had a thick section which thinned outwards and was built around two spruce box spars and fabric covered. Its ailerons tapered in chord out to the wing tips; together, they occupied 45% of the span. The wing was mounted a little above the fuselage on four short struts, two to each spar, an unusual arrangement used earlier on the U 5 and chosen by its designer, Hans Herrmanns, to improve both the aerodynamics at the wing-fuselage junction and cabin ventilation, a problem in small cabin aircraft of the time. Under the wing, part of the cabin roof was open. The wing struts, uncovered on the U 5, were covered by longitudinal panels. At least three types of radial engines powered the five U.8s known to have been built. The first examples had the Siemens-Halske Sh 6 but later both nine- cylinder, Siemens-Halske Sh 12s and a 3-cylinder, Bristol Lucifer. No images of the Bristol installation are known but the German radials were cleanly cowled by the standards of their time, before either Townend rings or NACA cowlings had been introduced, and with quite large spinners but with cylinder heads exposed for cooling. One advantage of the gap between fuselage and wing was that the pilot's open cockpit could be placed under the wing leading edge rather than set into it, spoiling its aerodynamics. Entry into the plywood covered fuselage was through a port-side door under the wing; the three-seat cabin had pairs of windows on each side and a baggage space behind with its own door. At the rear the fuselage became quite slender, with a high mounted, long span, cantilever and almost rectangular plan tailplane with high aspect ratio elevators. The tailplane incidence could be adjusted in-flight. Its quadrant-shaped fin mounted a rudder which extended down to the keel. The U 8 had fixed, conventional landing gear of the single axle type which was more refined than that of the U5, with a longer oleo strut to mid-fuselage and rearward drag struts. There was a short tailskid. In about 1925 at least one Udet 8 was fitted with full-span Lippmann/Handley Page slats coupled to full- span ailerons which were lowered together as camber increasing flaps when the slats were deployed. It was one of the earliest German aircraft to have slats. The slatted Udet 8 was recorded as a Udet 8a or Udet 8B in contemporary journals, though a modern source states that the U 8a (D-839) had a new wing with an area increase of and a Sh-12 engine. D-839 is recorded as a U 8b in a reconstructed register. Operational history In 1925 one U 8, D-670, competed in the \\"Round Germany Flight\\", one of only two commercial types to do so. Powered during the contest by the Bristol Lucifer engine (it had a nine- cylinder Siemens at another time), it successfully completed all five circuits of the contest, a total of distance of but, with a more powerful engine than most in its class (C}, was ranked only ninth. Another Udet entrant, the two seat Udet U 10, won class B. The five U 8s were initially used by Deutsche Aero Lloyd, but two of them were transferred to Nordbayeriche Verkehrsflug when Aero Lloyd became Deutsche Lufthansa in 1926. One of these (D-670) crashed soon after. It was transferred to the DVS and was joined there by D-839 later in the year.

Logan; August 15, 1838 - February 22, 1923) was an American writer and editor from the U.S. state of Missouri. Early years and education It was near the present village of Sturgeon, Missouri then known as Petersburg, in Boone County, Missouri, that Mary Simmerson Cunningham was born, on August 15, 1838. Her American ancestry went back to an Irish settler of Virginia and a French pioneer of Louisiana. Her great-grandfather, Robert Cunningham, of Virginia, was a soldier of the war for Independence, after which he removed to Tennessee, thence to Alabama, and thence to Illinois, when still a Territory, and there manumitted his slaves. Her father, Captain John M. Cunningham of Marion, Illinois, had been engaged in both the Black Hawk and Mexican-American wars. He was twice elected sheriff and county clerk of Williamson County, Illinois, U. S. marshal of the southern district of Illinois, and President Franklin Pierce appointed him register of the land office at Shawneetown, Illinois. He was also a member of the Legislature of Illinois in 1845 and 1846. Her mother was Miss Elizabeth Fontaine, of a distinguished family of that name which had arrived in Louisiana during the French occupancy of that country and had thence journeyed up the Mississippi River and settled in Missouri. It was here that John Cunningham met Elizabeth Fontaine and they married. When Mary was one year old, her parents removed to Illinois and settled at Marion, her father's home town. By the time she was nine years old, she encountered the dangers of a frontier home, when her father went forth to fight in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and braved the miner's life in the Sierra Nevada of California. Mary relieved her mother, who was not strong, of most of the household work, while attending the primitive school of the neighborhood, and trained herself in needlework. In 1853, she was sent to the Convent of St. Vincent, near Morganfield, Kentucky, a branch of the Nazareth Institute, the oldest institution of the kind in the US. This was the nearest educational establishment of sufficient advancement in the higher branches of education. During the time that her father was a captain of volunteers in the Mexican War, John A. Logan was in the same regiment. He and the captain became warm friends, and their friendship continued through life. Mary was the oldest of thirteen children, and the large family, with the modest circumstances of her father, compelled her to start working after her graduation from St. Vincent's in 1855. The instruction she received at Saint Vincent's aided her in the preparation of important papers which were needed by her father, the Captain, for example, acting as his clerk during his tenure as land register during President Pierce's administration. Marriage and career Mary Simmerson Cunningham Logan She met and formed an attachment with John A. Logan, 13 years her senior, while working with her father in Shawneetown. Mr. Logan was then an ambitious young lawyer, the prosecuting attorney for the third judicial circuit of Illinois, residing in the town of Benton, Illinois. They married November 27, 1855, when she was 16 years old, and at once went to the young attorney's home at Benton. Though she was reared a Baptist, after her marriage she joined the Methodist Church, the church of the Logan family. In Benton, Illinois, where he opened a law office. He was elected again to the Legislature in 1856, as a Democrat, in the celebrated Fremont campaign. During this term in the Legislature he became quite prominent through his advocacy of very important measures, and as early as 1857, was called by a colleague in the Legislature the \\"Black Eagle of the South.\\" The title being suggested by his vigor and independence and very dark complexion. Mrs. Logan immediately identified her interests with those of her husband and in many ways she contributed to his many successes in the political world. She accompanied him on all his professional journeys, an undertaking in those days of wildernesses and no roads, often requiring great endurance and privation. A son, John Cunningham Logan, was born in 1856 but died the following year. Also in 1856, Mrs. Logan saw her husband elected a member of the Legislature, and in the Douglas and Lincoln Senatorial contest, he was elected as a Douglas Democrat to Congress. In all the political campaigns, the wife went with her husband, assisting in much of his Work of correspondence and copying, and frequently receiving his friends and conferring with them on the details of the campaign. When Mr. Logan came to Congress as a Representative, Mrs. Logan came with him. She remained with him in Washington until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when he resigned his seat in Congress to return to Illinois to go into the service of his country. Mary and John Logan, with son, Manning, and daughter, Mary. With the war commencing in 1861, and Mr. Logan assigned to the command of the 31st Illinois Volunteers, Mrs. Logan and daughter Mary (nicknamed \\"Dollie\\", 1858-1940) returned to Capt Cunningham's home at Marion. The Illinois troops having been ordered into camp at Cairo, Mrs. Logan joined her husband there. During the battle of Belmont, Mrs. Logan cared for the wounded soldiers as they were brought back from the bloody field. When the army entered upon the Tennessee River campaign, Mrs. Logan again returned to her home, but was soon shocked by the news from Donelson that her husband had fallen at the head of his charging columns, dangerously wounded. She hastened to the scene to care for her husband, a struggle between life and death. At Memphis, in the winter of 1862-3, Mrs. Logan again joined her husband, now a general, and remained there until he led his troops in the campaign which ended in the surrender of Vicksburg. During this time, and to the end of the war, Mrs. Logan remained at Carbondale, where, out of the General's salary, they had bought an unpretentious home. Upon his return from the war, General Logan was nominated by acclamation for Congressman-at-large. After his election, Mrs. Logan returned to Washington and became a prominent figure in Washington society. After his service in the United States House of Representatives, General Logan was elected to the United States Senate. At the time of his nomination for the vice-presidency with James G. Blaine, it was she who restrained the impetuosity of her husband, who would have scorned the nomination, and prevented any differences between the leaders of the party. It came as a terrible blow to Mrs. Logan when the General became sick and died. She decided a change of scene would help her and so she traveled through Europe, chaperoning George Pullman's daughters. On her return, Mrs. Logan became the editor of The Home Magazine, of Washington, which ran from 1888 to 1908, writing reminiscences of historic events. She served on the syndicate staff of Hearst news service, was a contributor to other magazine and newspapers, and wrote several books. President Benjamin Harrison appointed Mrs. Logan one of the women commissioners of the District of Columbia to the Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893). She also worked on plans for the Garfield Memorial Hospital, having been president of the board nine years. Logan died in 1923. Calumet Place Calumet Place, Logan's home in Washington D.C. The family residence, \\"Calumet Place,\\" Washington, in which Gen. Logan died, was then a new and long-desired home, but unpaid for. Friends of the General in Chicago voluntarily raised a fund and put it at Mrs. Logan's disposal. The first thing she did was to secure the homestead, and in it devoted what was once the studio of an artist and former owner to a \\"Memorial Hall,\\" where all the General's books, army uniforms, portraits, busts, presents and souvenirs of life were gathered to form an interesting collection. She gave the collection of memorials, trophies and souvenirs of her husband and only son, Maj.

History Lustre was founded in the early 1900s primarily by Mennonite Families who homesteaded the area located on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. The community of modern-day Lustre consists of two churches and two schools. The Lustre Mennonite Brethren Church was established in 1917 about the same time as the Evangelical Mennonite Brethren Church. Both churches serve the needs of the local community and they often do worship services, camp ministry, and service projects together. Working together, both churches support an active AWANA ministry as well as Beacon Bible Camp ministry. Both churches are Evangelical and are faithful in their preaching and proclamation of the Gospel Message. The two schools are an elementary school and a high school. The elementary school is a public school K-8 and the High School is a private Christian High School and boarding school for those who come from other cities, states and nations. Lustre Christian High School is certified with ACSI and has volleyball, basketball, and track teams. Lustre is surrounded by wheat fields and cattle ranches. Agriculture is the primary occupation in the region. Lustre Christian High School hosts an annual dinner and auction called Schmeckfest. This dinner is usually towards the end of March and all are invited. Traditional foods are highlighted as well as the quilt and hand-made furniture auction. A post office called Lustre was established in 1917, and remained in operation until 1959. The area population of Lustre is about 200. The summer days are long and warm and the winter days are cold, windy and short. Lustre tends to have above average wind. There is very little moisture in the air so Lustre rarely gets wet heavy snow in the winter months. The spring months are filled with planting crops, planting gardens and seeing new calves being born. The summer months are filled with haying, harvesting and short vacations. Fall months are filled with crop and garden harvesting as well as back to school activities. Winter months are filled with sports games, AWANA ministry, family vacations and many hours visiting friends and neighbors. The community's name was selected on account of its euphonic sound.

Description Kunzea micromera is sparsely branched shrub which typically grows to a height of , usually with a few main stems each with a few side branches. The leaves are elliptic to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, mostly long and about wide with a petiole less than long. The flowers are arranged in heads of mostly twelve to twenty on the ends of a few long shoots. The flowers are surrounded by egg-shaped bracts which are long and wide and mostly glabrous and by pairs of slightly smaller bracteoles. The floral cup is about long and glabrous. The five sepals are egg-shaped with a rounded end, glabrous and about long. The five petals are pink, egg-shaped to almost round, long and wide. There are 14 to 22 stamens long in several rows in each flower. Flowering occurs between August and November and is followed by fruit which are urn-shaped capsules with an obvious bulge and with the sepals remaining. Taxonomy and naming Kunzea micromera was first formally described in 1848 by the botanist Johannes Conrad Schauer in Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's work Plantae Preissianae.

Guy L. Steele Jr. and Richard P. Gabriel (1993) name him as a leader of the Common Lisp movement and describe him as \\"a seductively powerful thinker, quiet and often insulting, whose arguments are almost impossible to refute\\"., p. 44. Work Maclisp, a variant of Lisp developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by Richard Greenblatt in the late 1960s, originally ran on the PDP-6 and PDP-10 computers made by Digital Equipment Corporation. In the early 1970s, Moon headed a project at MIT that reimplemented Maclisp on a different kind of computer, the Honeywell 6180 running the Multics operating system. The compiler that he developed, NCOMPLR, became the \\"standard against which all other Lisp compilers were measured\\"., p. 10. As part of this project, he also wrote what became the standard manual for Maclisp more generally, titled the MacLISP Reference Manual but often called the Moonual.. Reprinted in . Moon was one of the original members of Greenblatt's project to develop the MIT Lisp Machine, beginning in 1974. In 1976, with Steele, he wrote the first (TECO-based) version of the Emacs text editor,Richard Stallman is credited by Salus and others as another co-creator, but as Daniel Weinreb wrote, \\"The original (TECO-based) Emacs was created and designed by Guy L. Steele Jr. and David Moon. After they had it working, and it had become established as the standard text editor at the AI lab, Stallman took over its maintenance.\\" Moon himself responded \\"All true, so far as I can remember. But in all fairness I have to say that Stallman greatly improved Emacs after he \\"liberated\\" it from Guy and me.\\" See . and in 1978 with Daniel Weinreb he coauthored the manual for the Lisp Machine, known as the chine nual. With Howard Cannon, he developed Flavors, a system for doing object-oriented programming with multiple inheritance on the Lisp Machine. As part of the Lisp Machine project, he also invented ephemeral garbage collection, an advance that led to the widespread use of continuously-operating garbage collection systems in Lisp more generally., p. 28: \\"While there was a great deal of theoretical work on interleaved and concurrent garbage collection during the 1970s, continuous garbage collection was not universally accepted until David Moon's invention of ephemeral garbage collection and its implementation on Lisp Machines.\\" When Symbolics was founded in 1980 to commercialize the Lisp Machine, he became one of its founders. He continued to develop new hardware and software at Symbolics, and was listed as a Symbolics Fellow in 1989, but left the company in 1990 to join a project to develop a new operating system.

The transfer of the hygroscopic and readily water-soluble hydrochlorides and the liquid free bases into the tetrafluoroborates, which are difficult to solubilize in water, facilitate the handling of the substances considerably. The relatively uncomplicated convergent synthesis with easily accessible reactants and very good yields of the intermediates make P4-t-Bu an interesting phosphazene superbase.  Properties  P4-t-Bu is one of the strongest neutral nitrogenous bases with an extrapolated pKa value of 42.1 in acetonitrile and is compared to the strong base DBU with a pKa value of 24.3 by 18 orders of magnitude more basic. The compound is very well soluble in non-polar solvents, such as hexane, toluene or tetrahydrofuran, and is usually commercially available as a 0.8 to 1 molar solution in hexane. Already in weakly acidic media protonation produces the extremely delocalized and soft P4-t-Bu-H cation and causes besides a very strong solubilization effect also an extreme acceleration of addition reactions even at temperatures below -78 ¬∞C. P4-t-Bu owes its extraordinarily high basicity with low nucleophilicity to its very high steric hindrance and the involvement of many donor groups in conjugation with the spatially demanding structure of the cation formed by protonation. P4-t-Bu is an extremely hygroscopic solid which is thermally stable up to 120 ¬∞C and chemically stable to (dry) oxygen and bases. Traces of water and protic impurities can be eliminated by addition of bromoethane. The base is both very hydrophilic and very lipophilic and can be recovered easily and almost completely from reaction mixtures by the formation of the sparingly soluble tetrafluoroborate salt. Because of its extremely weak Lewis basicity, the cation of P4-t-Bu suppresses typical side reactions of metal organyls (such as aldol condensations) as can be caused by lithium amides such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA).  Applications  The neutral superbase P4-t-Bu is superior to ionic bases if those are sensitive to oxidation or side reactions (such as acylation) when they cause solubility problems or Lewis acid catalysed side reactions (such as aldol reactions, epoxy ring opening etc). The dehydrohalogenation of n-alkyl bromides yields the alkene, such as the reaction 1-bromooctane with P4-t-Bu which yields 1-octene almost quantitatively (96%) under mild conditions, compared to the potassium tert-butoxide/18-crown-6 system with only 75% yield. Alkylations on weakly acidic methylene groups (e.g. in the case of carboxylic esters or nitriles) proceed with high yield and selectivity. For example, by the reaction of 8-phenylmenthylphenylacetate with iodoethane in the presence of P4-t-Bu only the monoethyl derivative in the Z configuration is obtained in 95% yield. : Monoethylierung von 8-Phenylmenthyl-phenylacetat Succinonitrile reacts with iodoethane in the presence of P4-t-Bu in 98% yield to give the tetraethyl derivative without undergoing a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction to form a cyclic Œ±-ketonitrile. : Tetraalkylierung von 1,2-Dinitrilen Trifluoromethylation of ketones (such as benzophenone) is also possible at room temperature in good yields up to 84% with the inert fluoroform (HFC-23) in the presence of P4-t-Bu and tris(trimethylsilyl)amine. : Trifluormethylierung von Benzophenon mit Fluoroform Intramolecular cyclization of ortho-alkynylphenyl ethers leads in the presence of P4-t-Bu under mild conditions without metal catalysts to substituted benzofurans. : Cyclisierungen mit P4-t-Bu zu Benzofuranen Due to its extreme basicity it was suggested early on that P4-t-Bu should be suited as an initiator for anionic polymerization. With the ethyl acetate/P4-t-Bu initiator system, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with narrow polydispersity and molar masses up to 40,000 g¬∑mol‚àí1 could be obtained in THF. : Anionische Polymerisation von MMA zu PMMA Anionic polymerization of Ethylene oxide with the initiator system n-Butyllithium/P4-t-Bu yields well-defined Polyethylene oxides with low polydispersity. Cyclic siloxanes (such as hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane or decamethylcyclopentasiloxane) can also be polymerized with catalytic amounts of P4-t-Bu and water or silanols as initiators under good molecular weight control to thermally very stable polysiloxanes having decomposition temperatures of >450 ¬∞C. Because of its extreme basicity, P4-t-Bu eagerly absorbs water and carbon dioxide, both of which inhibit anionic polymerization. Heating to temperatures >100 ¬∞C removes CO2 and water and restores the anionic polymerization. The extreme hygroscopy of the phosphazene base P4-t-Bu as a substance and in solutions requires a great effort for storage and handling and prevents its broader use.

Published by Simon & Schuster, it chronicles the rise of Vladimir Putin during his time in Saint Petersburg in the 1990s. In the book, Dawisha exposes how Putin's friends and coworkers from his formative years have accumulated mass amounts of wealth and power. Although Putin was elected with promises to rein in the oligarchs who had emerged in the 1990s, Dawisha writes that Putin transformed \\"an oligarchy independent of, and more powerful than, the state into a corporatist structure in which oligarchs served at the pleasure of state officials, who themselves gained and exercised economic control... both for the state and for themselves.\\" As a result, 110 individuals control 35% of Russia's wealth, according to Dawisha. Whereas scholars have traditionally viewed Putin's Russia as a democracy in the process of failing, Dawisha argues that \\"from the beginning Putin and his circle sought to create an authoritarian regime ruled by a close-knit cabal... who used democracy for decoration rather than direction.\\" Publication controversy Dawisha sought to publish Putin's Kleptocracy with Cambridge University Press (CUP), with which she had previously published five books and which had initially accepted the book for publication. However, her 500-page manuscript, a quarter of which was evidentiary footnotes, was rejected by CUP. Editor John Haslam cited the legal risk of publishing the manuscript in an email of March 20, later published by Edward Lucas in The Economist. Haslam wrote that \\"Given the controversial subject matter of the book, and its basic premise that Putin's power is founded on his links to organised crime, we are not convinced that there is a way to rewrite the book that would give us the necessary comfort.\\" Dawisha responded that \\"one of the world's most important and reputable publishers declines to proceed with a book not because of its scholarly quality... but because the subject matter itself is too hot to handle.\\" Dawisha clarified that her indignation was not directed at CUP, but at the climate in Britain that allows \\"pre-emptive bookburning\\". Similarly, the Financial Times pointed to \\"fear of the UK's claimant-friendly libel laws\\". Dawisha later found a publisher in the US, where the libel laws are less restrictive. Critical reception Author Karen Dawisha in conversation with Putin Putin's Kleptocracy has been called an \\"unblinking scholarly expos√©\\" animated by \\"admirable relentlessness\\", in which \\"the power of her argument is amplified by the coolness of her prose\\". Although some have argued that Dawisha's book unleashes a \\"torrent of detail\\" which might \\"drown readers who are untutored in Soviet and Russian politics\\", it is nonetheless regarded as \\"the most persuasive account we have of corruption in contemporary Russia\\", and the copious detail is celebrated as a strength by others. Anne Applebaum commended the book's intense \\"focus on the financial story of Putin's rise to power: page after page contains the gritty details of criminal operation after criminal operation, including names, dates, and figures,\\" and lauded its courage: \\"Many of these details had never been put together before -- and for good reason.\\" In an article for The Times Literary Supplement by Richard Sakwa commented that the book is \\"an extraordinary dossier of malfeasance and political corruption on an epic scale\\" in which the accusation that \\"Putin and his close colleagues have enriched themselves is now effectively proven\\" and \\"a courageous and scrupulously judicious investigation into the sinews of wealth and power in Vladimir Putin's Russia\\". Sakwa, however, took issue with the term \\"kleptocracy\\" as \\"the evidence is often circumstantial, conjectural and partial. It would not stand questioning in court\\", while the connection with alleged kleptocracy in the \\"formulation of policy is far from clear. The much-vaunted stability of the Putin regime has, after all, delivered significant public goods.\\" Dawisha responded to Sakwa's position in a number of public forums. At a London event in 2015, Dawisha fielded a question referencing Sakwa's review, responding: \\"When a president talks about his business elite as chickens sitting on eggs... what is the nature of the understanding that they have? ‚Ä¶ Where is the rule of law in Russia? ‚Ä¶ the rule of law for Russia is in London. Why is it that $150 billion left the country last year? Because they believe that their wealth can only be secured in the long term outside their own country. So if you don't have the ability to secure your rights, then I don't think there's any political theory that would say that you have a social contract; not even Russian political theory.\\" References  External links  * Putin's Russia (Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, USA) 2014 non-fiction books Biographies about politicians Books about post-Soviet Russia English-language books Russian biographies Simon & Schuster books Books about Vladimir Putin ","title":"Putin's Kleptocracy"},{"id":"52795387","text":"HMS Alderney was a 10-gun (later, 12-gun) Alderney-class sloop of the Royal Navy that saw active service during the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War. Launched in 1757, she was principally deployed in the North Sea to protect British fishing fleets and merchant trade. In this capacity she captured two American privateers, Hawk in 1779 and the 12-gun Lady Washington in 1780. She was removed from Navy service at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War, and sold into private hands at Deptford Dockyard on 1 May 1783. She became the whaler Alderney that operated between 1784 and 1797, when the Spaniards captured her off Chile. Construction Alderney was the first of three vessels built to a 1755 design by Surveyor of the Navy William Bately, which collectively became known as Alderney-class sloops. These three vessels were Bately's first experience with ship design, for which he substantially borrowed from the shape and dimensions of George IIs yacht HMY Royal Caroline, built in 1750 by Master Shipwright John Hollond.McLaughlin 2014, p. 208, 279 Bately then added to Hollond's hull design by lengthening the \\"fore-rake\\" ‚Äì the area of the bow that extended beyond the keel ‚Äì in order to improve the sloop's stability in heavy swell.McLaughlin 2014, p.208. Admiralty Orders of 14 November 1755 indicated that the Alderney-class vessels were to be built at private dockyards, and on 17 December 1755 the contract for Alderney was issued to commercial shipwright John Snooks of Saltash. Contract terms stipulated that the vessel be completed within seven months at a cost of ¬£7.13s per ton burthen. The new vessel's keel was laid in January 1756 and work commenced on the hull. Bately's initial design was for a two-masted snow-rigged sloop, but this was modified in mid-1756 into a traditional three-masted ship rig to increase speed, though at the expense of manoeuvrability. The half-built sloop was formally christened Alderney on 25 May 1756.Winfield 2007, pp.310‚Äì311 HMS In mid-March 1761, Alderney captured a French privateer of six guns behind the Isle of Wight and took her into Portsmouth.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ2629. On 7 July 1777, Alderney, Captain Anthony Parrey, was off the Texel when he captured the American ship Commerce, Samuel Williams, master, as Commerce was sailing from South Carolina to Amsterdam. Commerce was a new vessel of 300 tons (bm), with a crew of 14 men, carrying a cargo of rice and indigo. She had on board as passengers Lieutenant Governor Bull and his family. Parrey put a prize crew on board Commerce, escorted her as far as Lowestoffe, and then sent her into London.Morgan (1986), Vol. 9, pp.475‚Äì6. On 24 February 1779 Alderney captured the American privateer Hawk. On 19 January 1781, Alderney, John Lockart Nasmith, captain, captured the Dutch dogger Sansleid. Then on 13 April Alderney recaptured the sloop Furnace. A few days later, i.e., on 19 April, Alderney was in company with the cutter , and the revenue cutter Hunter when they captured the French privateer Puce. On 25 December 1780, Alderney, under the command of Lieutenant Rose, captured the American privateer Lady Washington, of Dunkirk, under the command of Captain John Oliver. Lady Washington was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 51 men.Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 51, p.41. Disposal: In 1783, the Royal Navy sold the 26-year old sloop Alderney, of 230 tons (bm), at Deptford, on 1 May 1783 for ¬£780. Whaler Alderney entered British shipping registers when she appeared in Lloyd's Register for 1784, having undergone in 1783 a \\"good repair\\" and having been \\"raised\\" at Kings Yard. She was described as being a ship of 260 tons (bm), and copper sheathed.Lloyd's Register (1784), Seq. ‚ÑñA505. Alderneys first master was Wardell, her owner J.

Alderney and Wardel were reported to have returned to London from Greenland in early July 1786 having taken four \\"fish\\" (whales).Lloyd's List ‚Ññ1793. On 17 June 1787 she was reported again to have taken four fish.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ1899. On 22 June 1790, Alderney, Captain Sinclair Halcrow, master, was in the Davis Strait in the Labrador Sea. There her harpooner, Lawrence Frazier, at 6p.m. used a harpoon gun to shoot a whale at a distance of eight fathoms from the boat. The whale took about half-an-hour to die.Transactions of the Society, Instituted at London for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. The 2. Ed. (London, Dodsley, Lockyer Etc.).

Moving ashore on the West Coast on January 3, the system produced heavy snowfall in the Sierra Mountains, with nearly 4 feet of snowfall falling in the highest elevations. After impacting the Northwest and Southwest, the winter storm went on to strike the Southeast on January 5‚Äì6 with snow and ice, with snowfall accumulations up to . Afterwards, it began to morph into a nor'easter as it moved off the Southeast coast late on January 6, while producing blizzard conditions in the Carolinas. It then began to affect the Northeastern United States as it tracked northwards early on January 7. It produced a swath of moderate snowfall accumulations up the East Coast, with easternmost areas such as parts of Massachusetts receiving up to of snow. Fearful of another disaster reminiscent of that from late January 2014, residents of states such as Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia prepared in advance for the storm. Multiple advisories were issued in advance for winter weather in the affected areas. The storm caused nearly 35,000 or more power outages in the south, with at least five fatalities confirmed.  Meteorological history  On January 4 around 00:00 UTC, an area of low pressure associated with an atmospheric river moved onshore on the West Coast of the United States. With cold air in place, heavy snow began to fall in parts of Montana, Oregon, and in the Sierra Mountains, with maximum accumulations of nearly 4 feet. As it dived southeastwards, the low dissipated because of interaction with the mountains of areas such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada. However, leftover energy from the dissipating system continued to move south towards the Southeast. At the same time, a stationary front formed within the northeastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, and once this energy reached the front with cold air in place, snow, sleet, and ice began to break out in areas such as Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama as a new area of low pressure formed along the stationary front late on January 5. The aforementioned low then quickly moved onshore and continued to produce more wintry precipitation, as it tracked eastwards throughout the day on January 6. By 06:00 UTC on January 7, a new low developed just offshore the South Carolina coastline, and this low eventually became the dormant low as the system tracked offshore. The winter storm then began to intensify as it began tracking north-northeast, hugging the East Coast of the United States, while transitioning into a nor'easter. As it did so, snowfall began to spread all into parts of the Northeast, including New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut during the course of January 7. Further deepening of the winter storm occurred as snowfall began to end in parts of New England, and by 15:00 UTC on January 8, the cyclone had finally moved away from the coastline as an arctic airmass of high pressure began to settle in behind the storm. For the next two days, the storm system moved through Atlantic Canada and Southern Greenland, before being absorbed by a frontal system, forming to the west of Iceland on January 13.  Preparations and impact  =Southeast= North Carolina Snow in central North Carolina brought by the storm On January 6, 2017, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency. 10 inches of snow fell in Greensboro, High Point, Lewisville and Lenoir, and at one point 25,000 were without power. 700 traffic accidents were reported.  Mississippi  The winter storm laid a thin layer of ice across parts of the state, causing multiple road closures. Portions of Interstate 20 and Interstate 55 were also closed because of the ice, as multiple bridges and overpasses had ice on them. 62 accidents were reported, but there were no injuries reported from the Magnolia State.  Alabama  In Alabama, governor Robert J. Bentley declared a state of emergency on January 5, in advance of the storm, deploying 300 soldiers of the Alabama National Guard for assistance. Roads were closed in Alabama as the winter storm moved through, with officials urging residents to stay inside. Multiple portions of interstates were closed, with the climax being Interstate 59 becoming impassable early on January 8. Curfews were also put in place as conditions deteriorated quickly, advising travel would not be a good idea.  Virginia  A blizzard warning was issued on January 5 for the eastern coast of the state, an extremely rare event. The heaviest accumulations of the storm reached . Slick roads lead to nearly 500 crashes, one of which claimed a life. On January 7, the stretch of roads from Interstate 664 to Interstate 64 in Hampton, was closed because of heavy snowfall, as well as every flight being cancelled at the Norfolk International Airport. The Port of Virginia was also closed at midnight on January 7 because of the possibility of white-out conditions. Vessels were prohibited from entering or leaving, and remaining ones were advised to stay docked. Georgia Snow in Canton, Georgia Early on January 7, travel was nearly impassable in the northern portion of the state, with 10,000 customers reporting power outages. 700 flights were cancelled at the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on January 6‚Äì7. Multiple cars were also reported to have slid off roads because of the treacherous conditions. Tennessee A school bus was reported to have slid off the road early on January 7 as the storm caused impacts. No injuries were reported. Schools were also let out earlier because of the deteriorating conditions. By 9:30 a.m, there was about 53 reported crashes.  Arkansas  At least four people died in traffic accidents as the system moved through. In response to slick roads caused by the storm, numerous schools closed. On January 6, governmental offices were closed, including all state nonessential offices. A speech Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson was scheduled to give to the Northeast Arkansas Political Animals was canceled. Kentucky A fatal crash was reported early on January 5 after a car struck a tree after sliding on the slippery roads. He died after being rushed to the hospital. Florida An EF0 tornado touched down near Live Oak causing roof damage and fallen trees and tree limbs. =Northeast= New Jersey On January 6, a winter storm warning was issued for parts of the state, as the system was expected to brush the coastline with the heaviest accumulations to the southeast. However, the snowfall totals were later upgraded to be shifted more west as the low was expected to track more to the west then originally thought. A winter weather advisory was also issued for the western parts of New Jersey; however, some of these areas were later included to the warning. Most of the major roads in the state, such as the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike had their speed limits reduced because of the snowfall, although residents were advised across the state to stay inside.  Delaware  In Delaware, where as much as nearly a foot of snow fell and winds of up to , drivers faced extremely poor visibility, which caused dozens of cars to spin out during the day on roadways. As the snowfall ended, Delaware Department Transportation spokesman Jim Westhoff released a statement stating \\"We've got to get the roads in pretty good shape before that Monday morning.\\", because of the risk of slippery roads. Governor Jack Markell issued a limited state of emergency for the county of Sussex, advising residents to stay off the roads. In other areas such as Claymont, a car collided with a snowplow early on January 6. In total, roughly 94 crashes and 23 disabled vehicles were responded to by the Delaware State Police.  New York  In New York, as much as of snowfall fell in parts of the state, with New York City picking up their first measurable snow of the season. 2,300 city salt trucks and plows were dispatched to clear out the snow after the storm had subsided.  Connecticut  A mutli-car collision was reported on January 7 along a snow-covered portion of Interstate 91 near Middletown. No injuries or fatalities were reported; however, it gave authorities to warn residents about traveling on treacherous roads.  Massachusetts  At Boston Logan International Airport, the location picked up , their heaviest snowfall since a blizzard about two years prior, which dropped nearly on parts of the city. A total of 179 cancellations were made at the airport on January 6‚Äì7. Officials also warned residents to stay off the roadways of Cape Cod, with whiteout conditions being cited as the likely cause. Governor Charlie Baker had reported that minor crashes were reported in and around the state, none of which were injurious or fatal. He also stated that 3,000 snow plows or other equipment had been dispatched to clear off the major highways for travel.  Maine  In Maine, the stretch of the Maine Turnpike (I-95) from the New Hampshire state line to exit 53 had the speed limits reduced to . = Elsewhere =  Colorado  Frontier Airlines, centered in Denver, canceled roughly two dozen flights in advance of the storm's arrival. Ski lifts were shut down at Steamboat Springs, and an Avalanche Warning was issued for the Gunnison area.  Oklahoma  Between two and three inches of snow fell across the state, with higher totals occurring in the Panhandle and locally. Oktaha, in the eastern part of the state, measured five inches. Some highways closed while state crews treated them and dealt with accidents. Dozens of accidents were reported by the Oklahoma City Fire Department, with nine of them involving injuries, and many schools canceled classes in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area.

It is a rare ground orchid with a single leaf and one or two white flowers on a hairy stalk. Description Caladenia cretacea is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a spherical underground tuber and a single lance-shaped, reddish-green leaf, long and wide. One or two white or greyish-white flowers with reddish-brown tips are borne on a hairy spike tall. The flowers have a fragrance resembling hot metal. The petals and sepals are long and sometimes have a reddish line along their centres. The dorsal sepal is erect and the lateral sepals and petals spread widely but with drooping ends. The sepals are flat near their bases and wide at the base and taper to a thread-like end with reddish-brown glandular hairs. The petals are similar to the sepals but slightly shorter. The labellum is narrow triangular to lance-shaped, long and wide when flattened and curves downward at the tip. It is cream-coloured with reddish lines. The sides of the labellum turn upwards and have reddish a fringe of linear teeth mostly long but decreasing in size towards the front. There are about four rows of foot-shaped calli along the centre of the labellum, decreasing in size towards the front. Flowering occurs between late August and early October. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described by David L. Jones in 2006 and given the name Arachnorchis cretacea. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research, based on a specimen found in the Dalyenong Nature Conservation Reserve. In 2007, Gary Backhouse changed the name to Caladenia cretacea, publishing the name change in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (cretacea) is a Latin word meaning \\"chalky\\", referring to the dull white to grey colour of the flowers of this orchid. Distribution and habitat Stuart Mill spider orchid grows in eucalypt forest with a heathy understorey. It is only known from the John Colahan Griffin Nature Reserve near Stuart Mill. Conservation Caladenia cretacea is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. A successful program of propagation and reintroduction of the species has been undertaken, 70 of the 124 individuals planted having survived as at 2016. The main threats to the species are weed invasion and grazing by native animals and rabbits and as \\"Critically Endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act.

In the autumn of 1947, when still only in his mid-teens, he moved to Ware in Hertfordshire, England, to stay with his uncle. He attended Hertford Grammar School and went on to read English literature and philosophy at the University of Bristol. There he was a regular contributor as theatre and art critic to the university's student newspaper Nonesuch News.Chance Survivor, p. 177. After graduation, he spent a year in the Auvergne teaching English to students at a catering school in Clermont- Ferrand. He came back to England and took up a job in 1956 with the BBC Monitoring Service in London, working on the Hungarian desk.

Writings \\"Andrew Kennedy's contribution to the field of literature has been substantial and spans several literary genres to which he has contributed both as a critic and as creative writer.\\"Lie & R√∏nning, p. 9. Whether writing literary criticism or a short story, Kennedy employed great economy of style, something he admired in Strindberg's Ghost Sonata, for example. The final duologue between the Student and the Young Lady, asserted Kennedy, \\"compresses a whole cycle of relationship ‚Äì love, marriage and death ‚Äì within the cycle of one sustained encounter.\\"Kennedy, 1983, p. 211. Both his book Six Dramatists in Search of a Language (in which Kennedy explores the use of language by the playwrights Shaw, Eliot, Beckett, Pinter, Osborne and Arden) and Samuel Beckett were funded by grants from the Norwegian Research Council for Science and the Humanities (Norges Almenvitenskappelige Forskningsr√•d). In a prefatory remark to The Antique Dealer's Women, George Steiner writing about Kennedy's earlier book Double Vision declared that Kennedy's stories \\"are vignettes of insightful and humane understanding. They are of a concise maturity all too rare in the current climate of narrative.\\"The Antique Dealer's Women, p. iii.

Early life and education Lee was born on June 16, 1859, in Canton, New York, one of five children born to Reverend John Stebbins Lee and his wife Elmina. The elder Lee served as the first president of St. Lawrence University, from which Frederic received his bachelor's degree in 1878. (Frederic's brother, John Clarence, would go on to serve as the university's fifth president.) Frederic Lee received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1885 under the supervision of H. Newell Martin. Academic career After finishing his Ph.D., Lee traveled to Germany to work in the laboratory of distinguished physiology researcher Carl Ludwig in Leipzig for a year, where he developed an interest in the physiological mechanisms of fatigue and in electrophysiology. He then returned to the United States, spent a year as an instructor of biology at St. Lawrence, and then moved to an instructorship in histology and physiology at Bryn Mawr College. Lee was elected to the American Physiological Society at the first APS meeting in 1888. Lee began his career at Columbia in 1891 as a demonstrator for John Green Curtis, tasked with developing a new, practical laboratory course in physiology. Lee became an adjunct professor at Columbia in 1895, a professor in the physiology department in 1904, and the Dalton Professor of Physiology in 1904. He served as the physiology department's executive officer from 1911 to 1920. Lee retired from Columbia, assuming professor emeritus status, in 1938. Throughout his career, Lee was deeply involved in the American Physiological Society, serving as its 7th president from 1917-18, accumulating seventeen years as a member of its council, and serving shorter periods in various other administrative roles. Lee was noted for his interest in applying physiology research to war-related work during World War I; he held the role of consulting physiologist for the United States Public Health Service from 1917 to 1919 and of senior physiologist from 1919 to 1924. During the war, he oversaw studies of the physiology of worker fatigue (which led to recruiting a young Albert Baird Hastings to Columbia), and published this work in the book The Human Machine and Industrial Efficiency in 1919. Personal life Lee spent many years engaged with the governance of the New York Botanical Gardens, serving 24 years on its board of managers, two years as its vice president, and four years as its president, starting his term in 1923. He was also a trustee of the Columbia University Press and served as a member of the board of directors of an Arizona sanitorium. Lee died on December 14, 1939, following a long illness.

Ragamuffin Day took place on Thanksgiving, and typically involved children going from door to door asking for candy or money. These children were originally dressed in the style of the homeless of New York, with rags and oversized and exaggerated imitations of beggars. In further years, the children dressed as sailors, bandits and Disney characters. In the 1930s, the begging tradition was superseded by Ragamuffin parades, a predecessor of Thanksgiving Day parades. As Halloween became popular after the Great Depression, Ragamuffin events became less popular, however children continued the traditions into the 1940s. Around 1930, The New York Times published several articles in an attempt to end the tradition, that the children would \\"annoy adults\\" on Thanksgiving Day with their pleas for candy, money, and gifts. Later that year the newspaper reported that the parades were scarce in New York City, except in its outskirts, where the subway lines end. By 1937 several organizations began hosting Thanksgiving Day parades to discourage Ragamuffins, where the Thanksgiving parades would also feature children dressed both as beggars and in Halloween costumes. In the 1940s, some of these parades involved around 500 children. The last recorded Thanksgiving Day Ragamuffin parade was in 1956, overshadowed by Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. A Ragamuffin parade on October 15, 1972 in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, brought about 6,000 children and a crowd of around 35,000, making it the largest Ragamuffin parade in the United States at that time. =Present day= Ragamuffin parades continued in the outer boroughs of New York City after losing popularity in Manhattan. The parades are still held in the area, including in Bay Ridge, held since 1966, Park Ridge, New Jersey, and in Hoboken, New Jersey. Other communities include the Westchester County municipalities Pleasantville and Briarcliff Manor (where the parade has been held for about 30 years). In September 2016, a street in Bay Ridge was renamed \\"Ragamuffin Way\\" in honor of the neighborhood's 50-year- old tradition.

He was the first professor of architecture at the University of Wales and was also the head of the Welsh School of Architecture, where he instituted a new Department of Town Planning. Life and career Thomas was born to a Welsh family in Liverpool in 1916. Initially he wanted to become an artist, but was persuaded to study architecture by Lionel Bailey Budden. He graduated First Class Honours from the University of Liverpool in 1939, and then went to study town planning under William Holford. He spent the next seven years working with various architects in Cardiff, including contributions to the Alwyn Lloyd and Herbert Jackson South Wales Outline Plan. In 1947 he returned to Liverpool to teach at the Liverpool School of Architecture, where he presently became a senior lecturer. During this time he also worked in a private architecture practice, and Cedarwood, a house he designed with Gerald Beech in the Liverpool suburb of Woolton, was named \\"House of the Year\\" in 1960 by Woman's Journal. He returned to Wales once again in 1960 to head the Welsh School of Architecture, where he would remain until his retirement in 1981. After retirement as a teacher, Thomas returned to practical architecture once more, contributing to the design of Y Pencadlys (County Hall) in Caernarfon, the headquarters of Gwynedd County Council, executed by the Council's architects Merfyn Roberts and Terry Potter 1982-86\\\\. Outside of his work, Thomas was also well known as an environmental campaigner, regularly petitioning on behalf of such organisations as Civic Trust for Wales and the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales. He also served as a commissioner on the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, and a member of the Gorsedd of Bards.

The Areia Vermelha is a sandbar that is uncovered only at low tide, separated from the sea by the line of reefs that protects the whole length of the Para√≠ba coastline. It is about from the Praia de Camboinha, a beach in Cabedelo. The sandbank attracts many visitors on the weekends who walk, swim and investigate the pools. It is surrounded by corals with typical fauna. History The Areia Vermelha Marine State Park was created by state law 21.263 of 28 August 2000. It is administered by the Environmental Management Superintendence of Para√≠ba (Sudema). Studies prepared during development of the Management Plan showed serious degradation of the environment by intense and uncontrolled human activities and by practices incompatible with maintenance of the fauna and flora. On 12 November 2015 an agreement was made between the state and municipal government to better protect the park. As of January 2016 new rules were implemented that included prohibition of the sale of consumption of food and beverages in the park, and a ban on motor boats, carts, grills, tables and chairs. The food prohibition was because left-overs were attracting catfish, upsetting the delicate ecological balance of the reef.

The program involves providing a regular dose of alcohol to individuals with alcohol addiction, typically at a shelter-based harm reduction centre. The centres operating a managed alcohol program are distinct from typical homeless shelters. The latter usually enforce abstinence from alcohol, whereas the former permit alcohol consumption \\"in managed doses or in specific areas\\". These shelters ensure that high-risk homeless individuals can avoid \\"exposure to extreme weather conditions, assault on the street, alcohol poisoning, or the substitution of non-beverage for alcohol products\\". They are also distinct from wet shelters, with criteria for admission and offering a greater breadth of services, such as on-site or referral medical, mental health, and social services. Such programs enable individuals to reduce alcohol consumption, improve hygiene, and improve nutrition and overall health. Other benefits include providing the affected individual with community services and housing, a reduction in health care and emergency service expenses, and less time in prison. Background In March 2006, the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse published the report The Costs of Substance Abuse in Canada 2002, stating that in 2002 the costs to Canadian society associated with alcohol abuse to be $14.6 billion, representing 36.6% of costs incurred for all substance abuse (including tobacco and illicit drugs). These costs involved the loss of productivity, and the provision of services such as health care and law enforcement. The report stated that between 8,100 and 9,100 deaths were attributable to alcohol abuse, representing over 500,000 potential years of life lost (PYLL). The leading causes of death were cirrhosis, motor vehicle collisions, and suicide. Deaths attributed to alcohol abuse represented 1.9% of all deaths in Canada in 2002. Alcohol abuse also resulted in over 1.5 million acute care days in a hospital. Five broad categories of costs associated with alcohol abuse were identified in the report. Direct health care costs include acute care hospitalization ($1.46 billion), prescription drugs ($768 million), specialized inpatient treatment ($755 million), family physician visits ($173 million), ambulatory care ($80 million), specialized outpatient treatment ($52 million), and psychiatric hospitalization ($20 million). Direct law enforcement costs include police services ($1.9 billion), corrections and probation ($660 million), and court services ($513 million). Direct prevention and research costs include prevention programs ($34 million), research ($17 million), and operational costs ($2 million). Other direct costs include traffic collision damage ($757 million), fire damage ($157 million), administrative costs for transfer payments ($62 million for worker's compensation and $4 million for social welfare), and workplace health promotion ($17 million). The indirect costs are productivity losses from long-term disability ($6.2 billion), premature death ($923 million), and short-term disability ($24 million for reduced activity, $16 million for days in bed). Programs The first managed alcohol program in Canada, the Annex Harm Reduction Program, was established in 1996 at Seaton House, the largest homeless shelter in Toronto. The program was founded as a result of the death of three homeless men in the city in 1995. Its target clients are homeless men with \\"difficult behaviours, mental illness or severe alcohol and drug problem\\". Individuals who are \\"too high-functioning\\" are not accepted into the program. These men receive one alcoholic beverage per hour at most, though staff may refuse to grant an inebriated client alcohol. They may also exchange non-beverage alcohol such as mouthwash or household cleaning products for beverage alcohol. Although permitted up to 15 alcoholic beverages per day, the average client consumes six drinks daily. Individuals who consume alcohol outside the program are not served alcohol in the program. The program is administered by two full time registered nurses and case workers, and serves as a teaching program for St. Michael's Hospital. Since inception, visits to the emergency department have decreased 93%. In 2010, the program resulted in a cost reduction for the city of Toronto of $3300/day/client for emergency medical services, police, and health care services not utilized. Between 12‚Äì24 clients die each year in the program, typically \\"the culmination of chronic alcoholism, pre-existing health conditions and many years spent living in poverty and on the street\\". The Managed Alcohol Program in Ottawa, opened in 2001, is a shelter for homeless alcohol addicts that provides controlled hourly doses of alcohol. It is operated by the Shepherds of Good Hope and funded by the city. Each client receives seven ounces of white wine upon waking, and five ounces of wine once an hour until bedtime. The goal is to prevent binge drinking and consumption of alternate stimulants, and to eventually graduate the clients to a \\"domiciliary hostel program\\" once their alcohol consumption has stabilized. A study conducted by the Ottawa Police Service tracked 23 individuals before and after admission into the program between 2001 and 2007. This group totalled 1074 incidents involving police, costing about $122,000, before admission to the program, and 53 incidents costing $6,000 after admission. In Thunder Bay, the Kwae Kii Win managed alcohol program resulted in a 47% decrease in emergency service use and a 41% decrease in interaction with police. There was also a reduction in the number of people drinking non-beverage alcohol. Claremont House is Hamilton opened in 2005, and is located on the West 5th Campus of St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton. In a 2011 study prepared for the South West LHIN in London, a domiciliary hostel managed alcohol program was expected to cost $45/person/day to provide up to 20 beds with one full-time nurse, one full-time social worker, two full-time equivalent registered nurses, six health workers, and an on-site physician for six hours per week. Including food, alcohol, and other expenses, the cost would be about $82/person/day. Criticism Some, without evidence, have criticized the program as \\"giving up\\" on problem alcoholics by sedating them with alcohol, or that the free alcohol could attract individuals from outside the program area.

As of 2020, there are over 40,000 records in the database, including buildings, monuments, street furniture and other structures. The NIAH dataset does not cover Northern Ireland. Formation The NIAH is a unit of the Heritage Division within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The unit was founded in 1990 to address the obligations of the Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe of which Ireland is signatory. Initially, the NIAH existed only on a non-statutory basis with the task to create and maintain an inventory of to be protected buildings and sites. The legal framework for the NIAH was established with the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1999 which introduced access rights to the interior of buildings for the NIAH and preservation obligations for the local planning authorities. The subsequent Planning and Development Act 2000 delegated the responsibility to maintain records of protected structures (RPS) to the planning authorities, leaving the role to identify and document significant objects of architectural heritage to NIAH. Operation Surveying started in 1991 and focused first on towns. Clare was the first county to perform a county survey. Each building covered by one of the surveys is rated on a scale that includes the values \\"record only\\", \\"local\\", \\"regional\\", \\"national\\", and \\"international\\" where usually objects of at least regional significance are considered for protection. In 2001, the minister S√≠le de Valera used the result of these surveys to recommend the inclusion of 2,155 buildings in the record of protected structures by the respective planning authorities. As a full survey of the entire country using the same approach as for the town surveys was assumed to take more than 100 years, it was decided to begin with interim county surveys that focused on buildings with at least of regional significance. The surveys were published on CD-ROMs and online. The dataset has been published under the Creative Commons Attribtion 4.0 license. In addition, a series of books was published, each presenting the highlights of one of the surveys. As of 2017, 33 volumes are published. Another surveying project of the NIAH focuses on historic gardens and designed landscapes. These surveys started by comparing the 19th-century maps of the Ordnance Survey against aerial photography and were followed by on-site evaluations. In June 2009, the NIAH won the Europa Nostra Award for this project.

Having decided to cast Linda Thorson as Steed's new sidekick Tara King, producer John Bryce had started filming episodes with the character already in place and - as with her predecessors - no introduction. However Bryce was fired midway through production of the third episode, and the previous series producers, Albert Fennell and Brian Clemens, were re-hired. Clemens abandoned the episode whose production was underway (entitled \\"The Great, Great Britain Crime\\", scenes of which were later salvaged for the episode entitled \\"Homicide and Old Lace\\"). Instead, he decided that there needed to be a continuity explanation for the replacement of Mrs Peel by Tara King, and set about hastily developing a storyline which would account for this. Diana Rigg's scenes were shot in four days in December 1967 with production completed the following month.

It is found only on Kuchinoshima Island, in the Tokara Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture in southern Japan. It is one of six native Japanese cattle breeds, and one of two small populations that have never been cross-bred with Western cattle, the other being the Mishima breed from Mishima Island north-west of Hagi, in Yamaguchi Prefecture.  History  Cattle were brought to Japan from China at the same time as the cultivation of rice, in about the second century AD, in the Yayoi period. Until about the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, they were used only as draught animals, in agriculture, forestry, mining and for transport, and as a source of fertiliser. Milk consumption was unknown, and ‚Äì for cultural and religious reasons ‚Äì meat was not eaten. Cattle were highly prized and valuable, too expensive for a poor farmer to buy. Japan was effectively isolated from the rest of the world from 1635 until 1854; there was no possibility of intromission of foreign genes to the cattle population during this time. Between 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration, and 1887, some 2600 foreign cattle were imported. At first there was little interest in cross-breeding these with native stock, but from about 1900 it became widespread. It ceased abruptly in 1910, when it was realised that, while the cross-breeds might be larger and have better dairy qualities, their working capacity and meat quality was lower. Among the various heterogeneous regional populations that resulted from this brief period of cross-breeding, four separate strains were characterised, and were recognised as breeds in 1944. These were the four wagy≈´ breeds, the Japanese Black, the Japanese Brown and the Japanese Polled and the Japanese Shorthorn. The Kuchinoshima population originates from cattle that escaped from farms in 1918. It is one of two small isolated groups of cattle which escaped the process of hybridisation; the other is the Mishima breed from Mishima Island north-west of Hagi, in Yamaguchi Prefecture. Together they represent the only surviving remnant of the native cattle population of Japan. Since 1990, a few cattle have been removed from Kuchinoshima island, and small isolated populations have been bred at Kagoshima University and at Nagoya University; each has about 20 head, while some 55 remain on the island. In 2000 a mite-borne disease caused the death of about a third of the island population. In 2001 the total population was reported to be 99 head. The Kuchinoshima was listed by the FAO as \\"critical- maintained\\" in 2007.

There is no evidence that he was ever consecrated. Career Nicholas' ecclesiastical predecessor, Wimund, Bishop of the Isles appears to have used his elevated position to violently seek the inheritance of an Earl of Moray in the late 1140s.

Until 1959, he worked as a Post-Inspector at the Postscheckamt in Nuremberg. Riedl studied business administration alongside his work, and was subsequently taken over to the higher postal service. In 1962, he earned his doctorate. At the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, he worked on banking supervision in the transport industry, especially in Germany. In 1965 Riedl became political spokesman of the Federal Ministry for Post and Telecommunications under Richard St√ºcklen (during the first cabinet of Ludwig Erhard).

The Free Syrian Army's Martyr Ahmad al-Abdo Forces launched a night assault between 15 and 16 March against ISIL in the Eastern Qalamoun Mountains. The offensive was launched on two fronts, the eastern Qalamoun Mountains and the Syrian Desert along the Jordan‚ÄìSyria border. The rebels code-named the former as the \\"Battle for the Expulsion of Agressors\\" while the latter was termed the \\"Saddle of horses\\". The rebels seized several points in the al-Afai Mountain. Rebel factions attacked ISIL on 18 and 19 March near al-Badia and captured several areas, including a former Scientific Research Battalion base. They captured several areas including the strategic Mount Naqab on 20 March. By 21 March, the rebels had captured more than 25 square kilometres of territory in the eastern Qalamoun and more than 1,800 square kilometres overall since the start of the campaign. ISIL forces were routed from the majority of eastern Qalamoun. Ahrar al-Sham announced that its fighters had captured al-Afai mountain range. Rebels continued clashing at a rest stop near Baghdad-Damascus highway, amid advancement for the rebels in the region. It was reported on 24 March that ISIL was withdrawing from southern Syria to focus on the Raqqa offensive and had withdrawn from several areas of eastern Qalamoun without putting up any resistance. Two days later, FSA forces seized three more villages from ISIL near the Iraqi border. An FSA T-55 in the eastern Qalamoun Mountains during the second phase of the campaign The Syrian Arab Army, backed up by the National Defence Forces and the Air Force Intelligence Directorate, attacked ISIL in the countryside of eastern Suwayda on 26 March as the militants were withdrawing. SAA captured several villages and sites during the advance. The FSA made a large advance at the same time, reaching the front lines with SAA the next day. The FSA announced that they had captured al-Badia area and more than a dozen sites near Bir al-Qasab, which were the main ISIL strongholds in southeastern Syria. Many villages including Bir Qasab were captured from ISIL in the rebel advance. The rebels captured the Dakwa mountain area on 28 March, After midnight, areas in Bir Qasab were targeted by an air raid. The rebel advances fully expelled ISIL forces from the southwestern part of the Syrian Desert. On 29 March, the rebels announced that ISIL had been expelled from the entire countryside of Damascus.

The attack was repelled first by gunfire from the rebels and U.S. special operations forces, then by multiple airstrikes from the anti-ISIL coalition which killed most of the ISIL force and destroyed their vehicles. Rebels stated that four of their fighters and eight ISIL fighters were killed. =Third FSA offensive (20‚Äì30 April 2017)= On 20 April, FSA rebels led by the Lions of the East Army captured Alalianih, along with an abandoned military base, in the Syrian Desert.

The group recaptured several sites in the region. The next day, the FSA launched a counterattack in the region and its official media wing later stated that it had recaptured several sites. Aftermath During the campaign, some rebel groups started to advance into the Homs and Deir ez-Zor governorates. A rebel spokesman stated that their goal was the expulsion of ISIL from the region and reaching the city of Deir ez-Zor. They would be supported by the anti-ISIL Coalition, rather than having the Syrian Democratic Forces capture it. The FSA also wanted to capture the border town of al-Bukamal, the last border crossing under ISIL control between Iraq and Syria which they had also tried to capture in their failed 2016 offensive. On 30 April, the Revolutionary Commando Army attacked and advanced into eastern Syria, reaching the Deir ez-Zor Governorate and capturing the village of Humaymah to the south of the T2 pumping station.

He advanced from a choirmaster, organist, and teacher in an Anglican school to become a student in America and then a cultural and economic nationalist. He was the Second Vice President NCNC and Deputy Mayor of Lagos in 1951. Ojike was known as the \\"boycott king\\" for his slogan, 'boycott the boycottables'. In America, he spent 8 years involved in intellectual pursuit and improving outsiders‚Äô knowledge of Africa speaking from an African perspective. Upon his return, he promoted his brand of Africanisation, a persistent consumption of African forms of cloths, food, dress, religion and dances while also believing in the selective benefits of foreign amenities. Ojike made common the use of the word Mazi as a substitute for Mr. Among his publications are My Africa and I have Two Countries. Ojike was a sophisticated critic who was passionate about economic nationalism, he was sometimes outspoken which earned him some enmity. Early life and education Ojike was born to the family of Mgbeke and Mbonu Emeanlulu in Arondizuogu, Colonial Nigeria. Despite his father's protestations, Ojike attended Anglican schools, he had his primary education at CMS School, Arondizuogu. In 1925, he was a pupil teacher at Anglican Central School in Arondizuogu and Abagana. In 1929, he entered CMS Teachers Training College, Awka to train as a teacher, finishing training in 1931. Ojike soon gained employment at Dennis Memorial Grammar School, Onitsha. At the school, he was a choirmaster, sunday school supervisor and school organist. Ojike gradually became dissatisfied with a missionary's form of education criticizing it as not paramount to African development and suppressing African culture. Soon, he left the school and worked as an agent for West African Pilot. Motivated by the writings of James Aggrey and Azikiwe, Ojike decided to pursue further education abroad. In November 1938, Ojike left Nigeria with 11 other students for higher education. He started college at Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) before leaving for University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and finishing his studies at Ohio State University with a bachelor's degree in Economics. Ojike subsequently earned a master's degree in education and administration. Activism In U.S, Ojike lectured extensively about his experience living in an African cultural environment and his views about colonialism and racism. He wrote rejoinders to articles that portrayed Africa in a negative light in addition to writing two books and a pamphlet on African culture. His books explained cultural practices and debunked the notion of African inferiority. In My Africa, he introduced Americans to his culture partly as a way to promote a cultural relationship between the two cultures. In America, he embraced and learned about a democratic system of governance. He was also passionate about cultural and political nationalism, he rejected colonialism as detrimental to democracy and the idea that African society is a passing culture. Though a cultural nationalist, Ojike did not believe in rejection of all forms of Western culture but the notion of 'cultural plasticity' where Africans borrow certain aspects of a foreign culture but still retain the core social and political values that promotes stability, progress and dignity. In 1941, Ojike, K.O. Mbadiwe and John Karefa-Smart established the African Students Association of the United States and Canada. Among the objective of the organization was the welfare of African students and the interpretation of African culture to a western audience. Ojike was also a member of two Pan African organizations: American Council of African Education and the African Academy of Arts and Research. The latter was founded by Ojike, Mbadiwe, Orizu, Lawrence Reddick. The academy sponsored a series of well received dance events between 1943 and 1945. In 1945, Ojike was able to attend the United Nations Conference on International Organization as a member of these organizations. Upon his return to Nigeria, one of his early ideas was the establishment of a university based on an American higher education model. A primary strategy of the university was to save cost by providing education to students locally instead of students spending money to earn degrees outside the country. However, the idea never came to fruition. Between 1947 and 1948, he was the General Manager and a columnist for the West African Pilot, he wrote two columns: \\"Weekend Catechism\\" and \\"Something to Think About\\". In 1948, he left the pilot to start a business venture, the African Development Corporation, he raised capital and bought a popular bakery formerly owned by Amos Schackleford. After the death of 21 striking coal miners in 1949, Ojike in response wrote a column calling for concerted action against colonial authorities. The article was interpreted as sedition and Ojike was fined. The shootings also motivated him to co-found a broad organization called the National Emergency Committee with Akinola Maja as chairperson. The organization briefly existed for a year and was a national voice opposing racial discrimination before political rivalry broke it up. Ojike was a supporter of a federal system of governance in Nigeria, at a general conference in Ibadan organized to draft the Macpherson Constitution, Ojike and Eyo Ita, co-wrote a minority report criticizing the adoptions of a regional government system and the introduction of House of Chiefs instead of a federal system composed of states with ethnic borders and removal of vested interest in governance. Ojike was prominent in the activities of NCNC especially in their rallies. He was an agent for mass mobilization and his \\"Freedom song\\" was a popular tune in NCNC rallies. He was Second National Vice President of the party and contested and won a seat to represent Lagos at the Legislative Council. In 1951, he was appointed Deputy Mayor of Lagos. In 1953, Ojike became involved in Eastern Nigeria politics and development when he was elected into the Eastern regional assembly. He was first appointed regional Minister of Works in 1954 before moving to finance in the same year. As minister, he supported the introduction of Pay As You Earn taxation and was involved in the establishment of the Eastern Region Finance Corporation and road construction. However, allegations of corruption swirled about his involvement in the corporation's purchase of shares in African Continental Bank while he was the sitting Minister of Finance. He resigned his position in 1956. At the Foster-Sutton tribunal investigating the activities of the corporation, Ojike was resolute in his loyalty to Azikiwe, the founder of the bank and NCNC leader especially when the arguments were framed in the form of economic freedom for the people or extending Western imperialism. Boycott king Ojike believed in selective importation and imitation. He wanted Africa to be economical free and politically independent. One of his slogans was \\"boycott the boycottables\\", a reduction in consumption of Western goods but investments in education and other economically productive ventures. He preferred palm wine to imported gin and promoted the wearing of African clothes among elites civil servants. He voiced support for the introduction of an African national costume and supported African music and dance, his interest in African music led the founding of the All African Dance Association. Personal life and death Ojike married two wives and had 5 children. He was a member of the Reformed Ogboni Society. Ojike died on November 29, 1956 at Parklane Hospital Enugu. He was buried the next day.

The book combines Oregon history with related trail hikes to highlight some of the state's most interesting and scenic sites. His next book, A Deeper Wild, was a fiction book about the life of Joaquin Miller. By the time A Deeper Wild was being published, Sullivan was selling about 16,000 books each year. The following year, Sullivan began publishing his hiking guides. The first was titled Oregon Trips and Trails. The book highlighted 100 Oregon outdoor destinations and included 800 maps and photographs. That same year, he published his first \\"100 hikes\\" guide book, based Oregon's regions. 100 Hikes in Southern Oregon was followed by 100 Hikes in the Central Oregon Cascades in 2005, 100 Hikes in Northwest Oregon and Southwest Washington in 2006, 100 Hikes/Travel Guide: Eastern Oregon in 2008, and 100 Hikes/Travel Guide: Oregon Coast and Coast Range in 2009. In 2010, he produced a hiking guide for two of Oregon's national parks. The book was titled Trails of Crater Lake National Park and Oregon Caves National Monument. In 2011, Oregon Favorites: Trails and Tales was published. All of his hiking guides include information on local history, geology, flora, and fauna as well as detailed trail maps, area photographs, and directions. Sullivan continues to update his hiking guides every few years. To help ensure his guides stay current, he offers a free copy for anyone who finds an error in one of his guide books. During this same period, Sullivan also published Cabin Fever: Notes from a part-time pioneer. A book about how Sullivan built a cabin in a remote area of the Oregon Coast Range using pioneer tools and building techniques. In 2007, he published a mystery story titles The Case of Einstein's Violin. The next year, Sullivan published a history of Oregon's most significant natural disasters. Oregon's Greatest Natural Disasters documented major fires, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions that impacted Oregon during the past 13,000 years. He also published two Oregon atlases, Oregon: Pacific Coast to Wallowa Mountains in 2008 and Atlas of Oregon Wilderness in 2009.Schneider, Katie \\"Eugene's William L.

A year later, he wrote a fictional account the D.B. Cooper aircraft hijacking. Sullivan's most recent book was published in 2014. It is a collection of short stories, entitled Oregon Variations: Stories. The book includes at least one story from every county in Oregon.Hart, Melissa, \\"A fresh take on an old crime: A review of The Case of D.B.

Martyn, and her mother was Fanny Plumb of Springfield, Missouri, whose family had been in that town for four generations. William and Fanny were married in 1877. The Martyn family lived in Portland, Oregon, during the early years of Marguerite's life, and her father, a Virginian, died there at the age of 30 while employed as a St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway superintendent. Her mother then studied telegraphy and was employed by the same railway company.\\"Marguerite Martyn Dies; Artist, Writer,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, April 17, 1948, page 5A Marriage license When Marguerite was 17 years old, the family returned to Springfield, and she enrolled in an arts program at Washington University in St. Louis.

To say she is quiet does not express it ‚Äì meek is the proper word, not realizing that she is doing anything out of the ordinary, nor that the skillful way in which she handles her pencil ranks her as unusually gifted.\\" She retired in 1939 and died of a cerebral hemorrhage in her Webster Groves home, 401 Lake Avenue, on April 17, 1948. Burial was in Oak Hill Cemetery in Kirkwood, Missouri. Career In 1899, Martyn was an art student.\\"Art Students' Exhibit,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, June 11, 1899, page 9 During the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904, Martyn drew a poster which she thought would be applicable to the closing of the exposition, and she brought it to the Sunday editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. It came too late for publication, but she was told to return with some other drawings, and, as a result, she was offered a job as an artist, a position she filled a year later. Martyn and her signature, 1908 At first, she illustrated articles in the newspaper's Sunday magazine. At one point she was told by the newspaper's managing editor to go to Belleville, Missouri, and interview a woman of note there, but she declined. The editor insisted, and she returned with a story which she handed in. The editor said it could not be printed and pointed to the fact that she had buried the most important information in the last paragraph. That was, it was said, \\"the first instruction she had ever had, and she has been writing successfully ever since.\\"Mrs. Charles P.

Bovard who had encouraged Martyn to \\"undertake interviews with the subjects of her drawings.\\" The earliest work which carried her byline was a drawing of spectators and models at a St. Louis convention of the National Dressmakers' Association in September 1905, Martyn being the only artist admitted.\\"So Interested, Women Spectators Stand on Chairs for Hours at Dressmakers' Convention,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, September 28, 1905, page 1 In 1908, Martyn and a roommate, Miss L.B. Friend, were unsuccessfully sued by Samuel Kessler, a \\"rich furrier\\" who owned their apartment building at 8A North Sarah Street, which they vacated without notice because the heat in their unit was not working. Kessler lost the case when Justice \\"Marty\\" Moore, who was himself a steamfitter at one time, queried the building janitor and found that the man had neither the proper engineering license nor the knowledge to substantiate the landlord's claim.\\"Justice Moore Was Gasfitter Himself,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, July 12, 1908. page 16 In Martyn's obituary, the Post-Dispatch said that she: \\"did a great variety of articles, mostly about individuals, but in some cases descriptive of public events, such as national political conventions, the Kentucky Derby race or world series ball games.\\" She also wrote about women's fashion and the women's suffrage movement, \\"in which she was enthusiastically interested.\\" Other topics were men's fashion, stage drama, horse shows and college life. Martyn's working style, in 1912, at least, was generally to ask few questions but then to listen \\"so intently one feels impelled to give the desired information.\\" She took no notes but during the interview she made her sketch. She was said to draw \\"in a light and sometimes fanciful style\\", which was also described as \\"gossamer-like\\".\\"Marguerite Martyn Funeral Tomorrow,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, April 18, 1948, page 5B (page 29 of the internet version) Self-sketches Martyn included her own figure in some of her drawings.

Her earliest work is associated with second-generation Bay Area Abstract Expressionism. Early years Lilly Fenichel was born in Vienna, Austria, to a Jewish family. Her father was a doctor and her mother a fashion designer; the psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel was her uncle. In 1939, following the Nazi invasion of Austria, her family fled the country, going first to the United Kingdom and then to the United States, where they settled in Hollywood. Fenichel studied art at the Chouinard Art Institute (1946‚Äì47) and Los Angeles City College (1947‚Äì48). She then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to study at the California School of Fine Arts (1950‚Äì52), where she worked with the painters Edward Corbett, Hassel Smith, Elmer Bischoff, and David Park. She started showing her work in the early 1950s. Her vigorously gestural, often black-and-white paintings from the 1960s and 1970s are grouped with work by other West Coast second-generation Abstract Expressionists such as Joan Brown, Jay DeFeo, and Sonia Gechtoff. Stylistically, her work from this period shows the influence of both West Coast Abstract Expressionism and the New York School. Of her own work from this period, Fenichel has said it was Abstract Expressionism \\"with a lot of drawing in it.\\" Unable to support herself with her painting, she worked as a photographers' stylist and as an art director and costume designer for movies. She served as the art director for the 1975 film Lucky Lady starring Liza Minnelli. Later career In the 1950s, Fenichel visited her former teacher Edward Corbett in Taos, New Mexico. In 1981, she moved there herself, settling in nearby Talpa. Fenichel's paintings done in New Mexico range from hard-edged geometric abstractions of the 1980s to sensual, lyrical studies of organic forms from the early 2000s; both show the influence of color field painting and kinship with the work of artists such as Helen Frankenthaler. One critic wrote that \\"all of Lilly Fenichel's paintings are related to nature, even when they are abstract to the point of being non-objective.\\" In the early 1980s, Fenichel also began working with wood and fiberglass, creating minimalist sculptures in soft colors. Fenichel's work has been shown mainly in the western United States, and her work is in the permanent collections of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art (California), the Harwood Museum of Art (Taos), and the Albuquerque Museum among other institutions. She has been awarded three Pollock-Krasner Grants. In 2014 the David Richard Gallery in Santa Fe mounted a retrospective of her work entitled \\"Rewind<>Replay: 1950‚Äì2014\\". As of 2014, Fenichel was living in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her painting career has spanned six decades so far.

It was founded in 1956. Establishment With threats to fine colonial mansions in Sydney, the first National Trust in Australia was established in New South Wales in 1945. In Victoria, where the heritage of ornate land boom buildings was less valued, it took some time for heritage advocates to get organised. The publication in 1953 of the popular Early Melbourne Architecture 1840-1888, by artist, writer, and public speaker Maie Casey was the first attempt at raising awareness. In the following months, major figures from society, the arts, town planning and architecture in Melbourne began to discuss the setting up of Trust similar to that in Britain and NSW. Spurred by the demolition of the spectacular 1870 mansion Wendrew in Toorak in 1954, and the likely imminent sale of the nearby grand colonial estate Como House, a series of ever larger meetings were held, culminating in the formation of the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) in May 1956, as a charity, with its first aim being the acquisition of Como. A remarkable feature of the people who established the Trust was the number of prominent and influential people, and \\"the close network of family and business between them\\". These figures included author Joan, her husband Daryl Lindsay, Director of the National Gallery of Victoria, R T M Pescott, director of the Museum of Victoria, architect and critic Robin Boyd, Maie Casey and her husband politician Richard Casey, Noel and Elizabeth Goss, architect Roy Simpson, and University of Melbourne Professor of Architecture Brian Lewis. Early Patrons included Sir Dallas Brooks and Lady Brooks, Sir Owen Dixon, Lord Baillieu, Lady Grimwade and Lady Murdoch.

T. Slattery was a clothing store in downtown Boston in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was a high-end store offering women's, children's, and men's apparel and accessories. The store was founded by Ellen T. Slattery in 1867. It was first located on Hayward Place off Washington Street, then moved to 631 Tremont Street, then Boylston Street, then 84 Beacon Street, then 156 Tremont Street across from the Boston Common in 1901, where it remained until it closed in 1957. In 1908, Boston retail veteran P. A. O'Connell, recently a co- proprietor of the Magrane Houston department store, became the company's long- term president. In 1913 the store expanded in 158 Tremont Street, taking all five floors of that building. By the 1930s Slattery's occupied three entire adjoining buildings. A branch was established in summer of 1916 in Magnolia, Massachusetts, on Cape Ann, in a purpose-built building at Lexington and Hesperus Avenues, for the summer resort trade. P. A. O'Connell believed in growing the business with branches, and Slattery‚Äôs opened a branch in the wealthy suburb of Wellesley in the early 1920s, and another branch in Coolidge Corner in Brookline in April 1927. The Wellesley branch moved to a new, larger site in November 1940, and the company continued to thrive through the 1940s. However, the company entered a decline in the 1950s, as did many urban stores due to loss of custom to suburban malls. The Brookline branch, suffering from high rent and lack of public parking, was closed in January 1957. The company ceased business altogether in June 1957. The buildings were later demolished and the Tremont on the Common high-rise apartment building constructed on the site in 1968.

As of 2016, she serves as the interim director of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. Lower's research areas include the history of Germany and Ukraine in World War II, the Holocaust, women's history, the history of human rights, and comparative genocide studies. Her 2013 book, Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields, was translated into 21 languages and was a finalist for the 2013 National Book Award in the nonfiction category and for the National Jewish Book Award. Education and career Lower was born in 1965. She earned a PhD in European History in 1999 from the American University in Washington, DC. From 2000 to 2004, Lower was the director of the visiting scholars programs at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). She was an assistant professor at Towson University in Maryland from 2004 to 2007. For the next five years she lived in Germany and worked at the Historical Seminar of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich as a research associate while serving as director of oral history research for the USHMM from 2010 to 2012. Lower was an associate professor at the Strassler Family Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University for the 2011-2012 academic year. Since 2012, she holds the John K. Roth Chair at Claremont McKenna College in California. In 2014 Lower was named the director of the Mgrublian Center for Human Rights at Claremont. As of 2016, she serves as the interim director of the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. Research on World War II For her research on the history of Germany, Poland, and Ukraine, Lower has received numerous awards and honors. Her work, Nazi Empire Building and the Holocaust in Ukraine, won the 2007 award from Choice, and the Baker-Burton Award of the Southern Historical Association for the best first work in European history. The work traces the history of Ukraine in World War II after that drive to establish German colonies under SS-Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler and the complex role of German bureaucrats, the military, and the local population in the implementation of the Holocaust. Lower considers arrogance, fear, jealousy, and Slavic and Communist as the central declarations for the imperial policy of the Nazis in Eastern Europe. The research in the archives of Zhytomyr, which was part of the German Reichskommissariat Ukraine from 1941 to 1944, also led Lower to her next project: exploring the role of the German women in the Nazi genocidal policies in occupied Poland and Soviet Union. Isabel Kershner in The New York Times finds that Lower's research \\"sheds new light on the Holocaust from a gender perspective, according to experts, and have further underlined the importance of the role of the lower echelons in the Nazi killing apparatus.\\" Lower's resulting work, Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields, was published in English in 2013 and then translated into 21 languages. In the book, Lower looks at nearly 500,000 women in World War II including women in Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. She examines their attempts to carry out their objectives to \\"conquer Slavic peoples ... and the murder of its Jews\\" and addresses the question of why these female perpetrators were not brought to justice after the war. In the United States, the book was a finalist for the National Book Award in the nonfiction category and for the National Jewish Book Award. The magazine and newspaper reviews were almost unanimously positive. The Guardian called the book \\"truly chilling\\" but was ambivalent on the presentation: on the one hand the reviewer finds that Lower has astutely communicated the physical and moral landscape of the time, on the other hand, her study did not include professional killers inside the Reich Security Main Office and in the SS.

It became a tenant when the building was completed and it remained until it built its own building in 1922. In 1918 anti-German sentiments that resulted from World War I forced the bank to change its name to Union Trust and Savings Bank. It remained in operation until 1932 when a run on its deposits as a result of the Great Depression forced it to fail. Its building was taken over by Dubuque Bank and Trust. Three prominent Dubuque professionals also had offices on the second floor of the building. German-born architect Martin Heer had offices beginning in 1888.

It is 975 meters long and runs west to east from Vester All√© to Europaplads at Dokk1. The street is situated in the Indre by neighborhood where it is a popular thoroughfare for pedestrians. The center contains Aarhus river which splits the street in a north and south side. The north side is pedestrianized in its entire length and contains the park M√∏lleparken and the recreational space Vadestedet (The Ford). The south side has a road on the western third, providing access to Emil Vetts Passage, Busgaden and the parking complex for Magasin du Nord. The east section is one of the most popular areas in the city for outdoor congregation, packed with bars and caf√©s.  History  \\"Ny jydske Kj√∏bstad-Creditforening\\", a credit union headquarters, from 1912 Aarhus originates as a Viking fort that was defended by moats and ramparts up to the middle age. The precursor to √Öboulevarden stems from 1477 when king Christian I gave permission to develop the southern ramparts along the river and houses were built on it. In 1674 a narrow alley along the river was transformed into a wider street which was named Aagade (Literal translation.: River Street) running from Immervad to Skolegade. √Öboulevarden was constructed between 1898 and 1934 along the river on the streets Aagade and Louisegade, running from Vester All√© to Christiansgade. At the coast it was extended further through a now non-existent street known as Revet and finally to Dynkarken and Europaplads where it ends. Between 1930 and 1958 the river was paved over in order to widen √Öboulevarden and allow for parking in the center. In connection with this redevelopment the street was named √Öboulevarden. Originally only the section that was Aagade was supposed to be named √Öboulevarden but member of the city council and editor of the newspaper Demokraten proposed using the name for the entire stretch which was approved, thus eliminating Louisegade as a street name. In 1989 Aarhus city council decided the river should be opened again. It took 16 years, until September 2005, before work began and another 2¬Ω years for the section along Immervad to Vester All√© to be opened. On 28 June 2008 the new section of river was inaugurated and work on the last section from Mindebrogade to the harbor front began. The last section was finished in the fall of 2015.  The Ford  Vadestedet When the river was opened in the 2000s the opportunity to create a new recreational space near the water was realized with the project that became known as Vadestedet (The Ford). The name refers to a ford that used to lead over the river by Immervad. When the river was opened a bridge was established there to connect Frederiksgade to Immervad. Next to the bridge a system of steps was created by the river, initially known as Den Spanske Trappe (The Spanish Steps) in reference to the steps in Rome, but today officially named Vadestedet. The steps lead to the edge of the river and are designed with seating. The Ford has become one of the most popular areas for outdoor recreation in the city and is packed with people in the evenings and when in the daytime when weather permits. The area east of the Ford is packed with bars and caf√©s and functions as a small leisure district in its own right.

Early life and education Curtis was born on October 29, 1844, in New York City, New York. He attended Harvard College and received his bachelor's degree in 1866 and his master's degree in 1869. He received his M.D. in 1870 from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, then a loose affiliate of Columbia University not integrated fully into the school until 1891. He received the honorary LL.D. degree in 1904. Academic career Curtis began his career in clinical practice even before he had formally received his MD with a junior appointment at Bellevue Hospital. He remained there for several years, eventually reaching the rank of attending surgeon in 1876 and serving in that role until 1880. He also became a medical school demonstrator at Columbia shortly after receiving his MD and remained on the teaching staff in various roles until becoming a professor in 1883. When John Call Dalton became the school's dean in 1883, Curtis took his place as a professor of physiology. Throughout his years at Columbia, Curtis was involved in education and service roles, including fourteen years as secretary of the faculty, six as the medical school representative on the university council, and one as acting dean of the faculty of medicine. Curtis retired from Columbia in 1909 and assumed professor emeritus status. Although Curtis was not especially active as a researcher, he was deeply interested in the education of medical students and in the history of medicine and physiology. He was one of five men recognized as the key founders of the American Physiological Society, and hosted its first meeting of seventeen attendees in his laboratory space at Columbia on December 30, 1887. He served on the APS council from its founding until 1893. Along with APS co-founder Silas Weir Mitchell, he worked to study the history of physiology on behalf of the society. He also sought to improve medical education in physiology, hiring Frederic Schiller Lee as a demonstrator at Columbia to develop more practical laboratory instruction. He contributed to a widely used physiology textbook and wrote a book of medical history called Harvey's Views on the Circulation of the Blood, published in 1915.

The album, named after the former name of the band, and featuring a cover image consisting on blue and yellow fractals by Marco del Moral Argumedo, was recorded from June 2013 to December 2014 and released on 21 May 2015. It was produced, mixed and mastered by the band's keyboardist Eduardo Marin√© and released in 2015 on digital stores.  Background  Keyboardist Eduardo Marin√©, drummer Daniel Hern√°ndez and bassist Luis Mauricio S√°nchez met in middle school in 2005, starting a friendship in a short period of time. They shared a common love for bands like Dream Theater and Iron Maiden, which lead to the formation of their first band when they were at age 17, mainly playing covers of some artists they used to listen like M√§go de Oz and Iron Maiden. Guitar player Daniel Moreno, S√°nchez long-time friend, joined the band, which would be later named Metalurgia, which served as an early musical output for the musicians. In 2008, Hern√°ndez and Marin√© decided they wanted to bring it up a notch and create a progressive metal project in the vein of bands like Symphony X and Dream Theater, parallel to Metalurgia. Guitarist Francesc Messeguer, Hern√°ndez long-time friend, became part of this band, anda a couple of months later S√°nchez would also join the new progressive metal path, naming the project Urania, which would later become the title of their debut album.  Recording  In 2009, the band changed their name to Tangerine Circus and began to work on their first songs. Those songs would later on become Urania, excluding \\"Into Her Traveling Mind\\", which was written almost 4 years later. In early 2013, Marin√© proposed that Urania got re-recorded in his newly founded studio. With the band self-producing its own work and Marin√© being in charge of engineering and mixing, Tangerine Circus reached a new level of control and detail with their work. It took them almost a year and a half to re-record and re-arrange their existing material into their final forms. \\"Into Her Traveling Mind\\", the opening song from Urania, was composed during that time due to a lack of a heavy and exciting opening for the record. \\"The Wings\\", the longest song on the album and composed of four parts, is slightly based on the Greek myth of Icarus.  Release  Urania was first released digitally on streaming services and digital stores on 21 May 2015. = Packaging = In 2016, the album, along with The Conspiracy Chronicles, was released as a two-disc set as a less expensive presentation to introduce their debut works to the public. The cover art of this set consists on Tangerine Circus's logo over a black background.  Live performances  Although there was never an official tour of the album, the band gigged in Mexico City to promote the album. They played dates in State of Mexico and Quer√©taro, promoting also their next release The Conspiracy Chronicles.

With nearly 8 million views on his leatherworking tutorial videos on YouTube, Hurst is recognized internationally as a teacher. His contributions to the leather industry over the last 50 years have been recognized with an Al Stohlman Award for Achievement in Leathercraft, the Lifetime Achievement Award by the International Federation of Leather Guilds, and the Master Leather Artisan Award by the Academy of Western Artists. Early life George Hurst was born in New Berlin, Pennsylvania in 1933. He was first introduced to leatherworking in shop class in highschool and began selling his work to family and friends. When Hurst joined the Army in 1952, he continued to pursue leathercraft as a profitable hobby. After he left the Army in 1955, he ran a furniture manufacturing business while operating his independent leather business as a part-time avocation before deciding to make a career of it. Leatherworking career In June 1961, Hurst took his first job with Tandy Leather as an Assistant Manager in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 20 months later, he was promoted to manager of a store in New York City before moving back to manage the Pennsylvania store in 1966. Hurst built his store‚Äôs business through innovative teaching techniques and was regularly one of the top selling managers in the company. After 9 years in Philadelphia, Hurst was promoted to Regional Manager in 1975 and then appointed Merchandising Manager in 1976. As the Merchandising Manager, Hurst regularly reported to Charles Tandy and served as the company‚Äôs liaison with author Al Stohlman. After leaving the company in 1978 to help establish The Leather Factory, Hurst was rehired by Tandy Leather as Merchandising Manager in 1985. While in this position, Hurst modernized leathercraft education by teaching leatherworking by means of video. Hurst pursued entrepreneurial efforts in the early 90s and started Hide Crafters Leather, where he hired leather veteran Jim Linnell to help build the new business. He later sold the inventory of the company to Double K Leather and returned to Tandy Leather to lead their digital media efforts.

It is native to Java, Indonesia. Description Feroniella lucida is a small to medium-sized tree armed with numerous long, slender, sharp thorns. It grows from 10 ‚Äì 15 metres tall with a straight bole 20 ‚Äì 30 cm in diameter. The fruit has a tough green rind with a white and pink pulp containing many yellow crunchy seeds. F. lucida was previously classified as a member of the genus Feronia, but was removed to its own genus by Swingle, who also named a Feroniella oblata now considered the same species as Feroniella lucida. Tanaka would name another genus member, Feroniella pubescens, but this is now known to be Harrisonia perforata, leaving F. lucida as the only member of Feroniella. However, based on recent phylogenetic analysis that surprisingly grouped F. lucida among the citrus, Mabberley suggested it be renamed Citrus lucida. Uses In Cambodia and Java occasionally cultivated as fruit tree. The pulp of the raw fruits is eaten as vegetable. The pericarp is used medicinally.http://mansfeld.ipk- gatersleben.de/apex/f?p=185:46:16768851750631::NO::module,mf_use,source,akzanz,rehm,akzname,taxid:mf,,botnam,0,,Feroniella%20lucida,7732 ' Mansfeld's World Database of Agricultural and Horticultural Crops The pulp is used as a sour ingredient in Cambodian and Thai cooking.

However, Kitty's Amelia had received clearance to sail 27 April, before the deadline. Thus, when she sailed on 27 July, she did so legally. This was the last legal slave voyage for an English vessel.BBC: Abolition of Transatlantic Slave Trade On her voyage she carried a supercargo, Captain Hugh Crow (or Crowe),Grindal (2016). who was a renowned and successful slave trader. On the way to Bonny, Forrest died and Crow took command. On 27 October 1807 five slavers, one of them Kitty's Amelia, left Bunce Island; they constituted the last legal convoy of British slavers. Because they were engaged in a legal voyage, they qualified for a British Royal Navy escort in the form of the 16-gun sloop , under the command of Lieutenant Frederick Hoffman (acting).

In contrast with Hoffman's assessment of the state of health aboard the slave ships, Crow, in his memoir, recalled that Kitty's Amelia had lost 30 whites and 50 blacks to sickness on the voyage, the whites included her two doctors, who had died shortly after she arrived at Jamaica. He further noted that many of the other slavers that had hurried to beat the deadline for the end of the slave trade had lost twice as many blacks. Records indicate that Kitty's Amelia lost 23 of her 43 crew. She had embarked some 277 slaves and she landed 233, for a 16% mortality rate. After loading a cargo for Liverpool, Crow decided to remain at Kingston to deal with some affairs.

Overview The police force grew out of the Belgrade General Police of the interwar period, which had a significant role in the suppression of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia after that organisation was banned in 1920. Eighty percent of work of the SP UGB related to suspected communists. It initially had a responsibility to investigate other groups, such as the Chetniks of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, but ended up cooperating with Mihailoviƒá's Chetnik movement. The SP UGB had significant autonomy in who it arrested, tortured and interrogated, and who it sent to the Banjica concentration camp, but did not have the power to release prisoners from the camp, a power which was retained by the Gestapo. The SP UGB exchanged information with a number of different agencies, including the German military intelligence service, the Abwehr, and other collaborationist organisations such as the Serbian Volunteer Corps. Background Following the 1938 Anschluss between Germany and Austria, Yugoslavia shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pressure as her neighbours aligned themselves with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it invaded and occupied neighbouring Albania. At the outbreak of World War II, the Yugoslav government declared its neutrality. Between September and November 1940, Hungary and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact, aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy invaded Greece. From that time, Yugoslavia was almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and her neutral stance toward the war became strained. In late February 1941, Bulgaria joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia. Intending to secure his southern flank for the impending attack on the Soviet Union, Adolf Hitler began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, Serbian nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers deposed the country's regent, Prince Paul, in a bloodless coup d'√©tat, placed his teenaged nephew Peter on the throne, and brought to power a \\"government of national unity\\" led by General Du≈°an Simoviƒá. The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered the country's invasion, which commenced on 6 April 1941. A map of the German-occupied territory of Serbia Yugoslavia was quickly overwhelmed by the combined strength of the Axis powers and surrendered in less than two weeks. The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. The German-occupied territory of Serbia was reduced to the Kingdom of Serbia's pre-Balkan War borders and was kept under directly military occupation by the Germans due to the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, as well as its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals. The occupied territory covered about 51,000 km2 and had a population of 3.8 million. The Germans began searching for a Serb suitable to lead a puppet government in Belgrade. Establishment On 21 April 1941, the German military area commander for Belgrade, Oberst Ernst Moritz von Kaisenberg, appointed Dragomir Jovanoviƒá to lead the city administration. In mid-May 1941, Jovanoviƒá established a special squad of 55 police agents, who were directly tasked by the overall German police and security organisation, Einsatzgruppe Serbia, with finding, arresting and questioning communists in Belgrade. This squad grew out of the Belgrade General Police of the interwar period, which included a political police organisation and had been closely involved in the suppression of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia since it was banned in 1920. The Belgrade General Police had also been involved in overseeing cultural and sports organisations, and had paid special attention to the University of Belgrade, a focal point of libertarian thought in interwar Yugoslavia. The pre-war chief of the anti-communist Section IV of the Belgrade General Police was Svetozar Vujkoviƒá, and his deputies were Stevan ≈†teriƒá and Brana Bo≈æiƒá, and a key agent in Vujkoviƒá's section was ƒêorƒëe Kosmajac. For a short time, the chief of the SP UGB was Mija Petroviƒá, but he was replaced after about a month by Ilija Paranos. The Gestapo had encountered Paranos during Hermann G√∂ring's 1936 visit to Yugoslavia to meet with Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Stojadinoviƒá, and they considered him an experienced and loyal officer. On 30 May 1941, the Germans settled on a leader for the Serbian puppet administration, Milan Aƒáimoviƒá, a staunch anti-communist who served as Yugoslavia's Minister of Internal Affairs during the winter of 1939‚Äì40. However, the SP UGB did not come under the control of Aƒáimoviƒá's Commissioner Government, and remained under Gestapo control. Two resistance movements emerged following the invasion: the communist-led Partisans, and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks. The Partisans were led by the revolutionary Josip Broz Tito, while the Chetniks were led by Colonel Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, an officer in the interwar Royal Yugoslav Army. The two movements had widely diverging goals. Whereas the Partisans sought to turn Yugoslavia into a communist state under Tito's leadership, the Chetniks sought a return to the pre-war status quo, whereby the Yugoslav monarchy‚Äîand by extension, Serb political hegemony‚Äîwould be restored. The Banjica concentration camp was established on 22 June 1941, by order of the head of the German military occupation administration in Serbia, Harald Turner, to the leader of the Serbian collaborationist administration, Milan Aƒáimoviƒá. The purpose of the camp was to hold communists arrested by the Gestapo and SP UGB. The staff of the camp, led by Vujkoviƒá, took over the camp on 5 July, and it admitted its first inmates on 9 July. Communist resistance commenced in early July, shortly after the invasion of the Soviet Union, targeting both the Germans and the puppet authorities. By the time of the communist-led uprising, the SP UGB was receiving praise from von Kaisenberg, as well as knives, rubber truncheons, rifles and handguns. There was a rapid increase in the size of the SP UGB after the uprising began. The SP UGB operated a network of informants who reported on the arrival of suspicious persons, meetings and conversations, and conducted regular inspections of companies, factories, institutions and hospitals. Structure and headquarters With minor changes, the SP UGB mirrored the organisation of the Belgrade General Police. It consisted of five sections: *Section I ‚Äì Administration, led by Bora Mirkoviƒá *Section II ‚Äì Foreigners, commanded by Josip Vuƒçiniƒá *Section III ‚Äì Chetniks of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, led by Nikola Gubarev *Section IV ‚Äì Communists, commanded by Bo≈°ko Beƒáareviƒá *Section V ‚Äì Central Registry, led by ƒêorƒëe ƒêorƒëeviƒá The remit of Section II was severely restricted, as the Gestapo maintained responsibility for monitoring and dealing with all foreigners in the occupied territory. During the occupation, 15,000 communist suspects from Belgrade were processed by Section IV, with that section responsible for over eighty per cent of all tasks undertaken by the SP UGB. The SP UGB was housed in a building at the corner of Takovska and Dalmatinska Streets, Belgrade. Although the SP UGB was tied to the administration of the City of Belgrade, it began to send teams of agents to regional centres, such as Ni≈°, Kragujevac, ≈†abac, Valjevo, Po≈æarevac and Leskovac. ≈†teriƒá was sent to head the SP UGB office in Kragujevac. Formally, these teams were subordinated to the area and district chiefs of the puppet administration, which mirrored the military area and district commands, but they were in regular contact with the local offices of the Gestapo in the various towns, and also sent reports to SP UGB headquarters. The SP UGB even tried to extend its reach to Yugoslav forced labourers and prisoners of war held in Germany. Operations The SP UGB operated on its own initiative to arrest, torture and interrogate communists, but was sometimes ordered by the Gestapo to arrest specific people. For example, in November 1941, the head of Einsatzgruppe Serbien directed the SP UGB to conduct an investigation into the \\"Snaga i svetlost\\" power station, where, according to German information, there was a grouping of communists. The SP UGB subsequently arrested several suspected communists and sent them to the Banjica concentration camp. However, while the SP UGB had a certain amount of autonomy in the arrest of people, they did not have any such autonomy in the release of prisoners from the Banjica camp. The SP UGB would make a recommendation, often accompanied by the views of the puppet regime, but only the Gestapo could approve release. In some cases, the Gestapo would refuse such requests without an explanation. Jovanoviƒá later established the Serbian Security Service (, SDB), and after its establishment, the SP UGB regularly exchanged information with it. The SP UGB also exchanged information with the collaborationist Serbian Volunteer Corps, the German military intelligence bureau, the Abwehr, and Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks. SP UGB agents were awarded cash bonuses for their efforts in combating communists. Jovanoviƒá's influence over the operations of the SP UGB was undeniable, particularly during round-ups and arrests in Belgrade, and also in decisions made about the categorisation and shooting of prisoners at the Banjica concentration camp, where many communists and others were taken by the SP UGB after interrogation.

Vote Nevada was won by incumbent President Gerald Ford (R‚ÄìMichigan), with 50.17% of the popular vote, against Jimmy Carter (D‚ÄìGeorgia), with 45.81% of the popular vote. None of the third- party candidates amounted to a significant portion of the vote, as 2.53% of the voters either wrote-in another candidate or selected ‚Äúno preference‚Äù. Despite losing in Nevada, Carter went on to win the national election and became the 39th president of the United States. Nevada has generally been a bellwether state since the early 20th century, and this election marked the first time since 1908 whereby Nevada was carried by the losing presidential candidate. Nevada would vote for the winning candidate in each election afterwards until 2016. , this is the last election in which a Democrat won the White House without Nevada, as well as the last time that Nye County, Storey County, and Esmeralda County voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‚ÄòHow the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century‚Äô; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results =Results by county= {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" - ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" County or City ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Gerald Rudolph FordOur Campaigns; NV US President 1976 Republican ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" James Earl Carter Democratic ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" No Candidate No Preference ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Roger Lea MacBride Libertarian ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Lester Garfield Maddox American Independent ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Margin ! colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Total votes cast - ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" # ! style=\\"text- align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" % ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data- sort-type=\\"number\\" # ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" % ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" # ! style=\\"text- align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" % ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data- sort-type=\\"number\\" # ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" % ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" # ! style=\\"text- align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" % ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data- sort-type=\\"number\\" # ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\" % - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Churchill   2,358   53.04%   1,800   40.49%   178   4.00%   33   0.74%   77   1.73%   558   12.55%   4,446 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Clark   48,236   46.92%   51,178   49.78%   2,015   1.96%   731   0.71%   652   0.63%   -2,942   -2.86%   102,812 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Douglas   3,095   58.60%   1,934   36.61%   162   3.07%   46   0.87%   45   0.85%   1,161   21.98%   5,282 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Elko   3,293   60.32%   1,955   35.81%   103   1.89%   40   0.73%   68   1.25%   1,338   24.51%   5,459 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"   Esmeralda   181   43.51%   214   51.44%   9   2.16%   3   0.72%   9   2.16%   -33   -7.93%   416 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Eureka   272   58.24%   163   34.90%   21   4.50%   5   1.07%   6   1.28%   109   23.34%   467 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Humboldt   1,380   53.38%   1,074   41.55%   88   3.40%   14   0.54%   29   1.12%   306   11.84%   2,585 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Lander   561   49.96%   518   46.13%   21   1.87%   8   0.71%   15   1.34%   43   3.83%   1,123 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Lincoln   700   50.04%   642   45.89%   34   2.43%   10   0.71%   13   0.93%   58   4.15%   1,399 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Lyon   2,068   49.69%   1,866   44.83%   155   3.72%   27   0.65%   46   1.11%   202   4.85%   4,162 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Mineral   1,104   42.56%   1,361   52.47%   92   3.55%   8   0.31%   29   1.12%   -257   -9.91%   2,594 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Nye   1,027   42.53%   1,261   52.22%   84   3.48%   18   0.75%   25   1.04%   -234   -9.69%   2,415 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Pershing   635   46.93%   633   46.78%   59   4.36%   13   0.96%   13   0.96%   2   0.15%   1,353 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Storey   274   43.08%   310   48.74%   30   4.72%   17   2.67%   5   0.79%   -36   -5.66%   636 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Washoe   29,264   54.98%   21,687   40.74%   1,599   3.00%   374   0.70%   303   0.57%   7,577   14.24%   53,227 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"   White Pine   1,543   41.27%   2,009   53.73%   91   2.43%   17   0.45%   79   2.11%   -466   -12.46%   3,739 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   Carson City   5,282   54.11%   3,874   39.69%   367   3.76%   155   1.59%   83   0.85%   1,408   14.42%   9,761 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" !Totals!!101,273!!50.17%!!92,479!!45.81%!!5,108!!2.53%!!1,519!!0.75%!!1,497!!0.74%!!8,794!!4.36%!!201,876 } Notes References Nevada 1976 1976 Nevada elections 1976 in Nevada ","title":"1976 United States presidential election in Nevada"},{"id":"52797138","text":"Clegg is a 1970 British crime film directed by Lindsay Shonteff.

Dudko served time in the Mulawa Women's Prison from 1999 to 2006 before being released on parole. Background Dudko was the mistress of John Killick (whom she had met at a party in the mid-1990s), who was being held on remand at Sydney's Silverwater Correctional Centre on charges of armed robbery. At the time, Dudko was residing with Killick's wife Gloria and visited Killick three times a week at his prison. During these meetings, Killick revealed a plan for Dudko to help him escape, having formed the idea of using a helicopter. Helicopter hijacking and Killick's breakout On the morning of 25 March 1999, Dudko waited at the Sydney International Airport to receive a call from Killick to confirm that he was entering the exercise yard at Silverwater. Once alerted, Dudko began a pre-booked helicopter flight over the construction site of Sydney Olympic Park. However, shortly into the flight Dudko drew a pistol from her bag and turned it on pilot Timothy Joyce. He was instructed to fly over the prison and land on the oval. Killick was able to climb into the helicopter, and shortly after officers of the prison opened fire on the vehicle with two bullets making contact. Once the helicopter was landed, Joyce was tied up and the couple hijacked a car to flee the location. Dudko and Killick remained on the run in both Victoria and New South Wales for 45 days. The escape made international headlines and has become one of the most famous counts of criminal activity in Australia during 1999. The actions also led to Dudko being dubbed \\"Red Lucy\\" by the media for her \\"crime of passion\\". Capture and imprisonment On 8 May 1999 the couple, returning to Sydney to receive money from one of Killick's former acquaintances, was arrested at the Bass Hill Caravan Park, where they had rented a cabin as \\"Mr. and Mrs. MG Brown\\". In March 2001, Dudko's trial began. She was found guilty by a jury of the District Court of New South Wales of five charges: the rescue of an inmate in lawful custody by force, assault on a member of the crew of an aircraft, detention for advantage, and two counts of unauthorised possession of a firearm. She was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years. Dudko served her time at the Mulawa Women's Prison and was released on parole on 9 May 2006. During her time in prison, Dudko wrote some 4,500 love letters to Killick. She ended all communications and as such their relationship when she rediscovered her faith in the Bible, something Killick did not believe in. In popular culture John Kerr printed the story of the prison escape for the first time in the 2003 book Wanted: John & Lucy: Rescue by Force, Silverwater Prison, 25 March 1999. The 2015 single \\"Long Loud Hours\\" by Australian hip hop musician Urthboy tells the story of Dudko's crime, sung from her perspective. Life after prison As of 2009, Dudko was working at a Rydalmere factory and living in a one-bedroom flat at the base of the Blue Mountains. A condition of Killick's parole upon his release from prison in 2015 was that he was not permitted to have any contact with Dudko until 2022 (when he will be 80 years old). However, in a later review of these terms, this condition was removed. Killick must still receive permission from his parole officer before making any contact with Dudko.

Arkansas voters chose six representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Arkansas was won by incumbent President Richard Nixon (R‚ÄìCalifornia), with 68.82% of the popular vote, against George McGovern (D‚ÄìSouth Dakota), with 30.71% of the popular vote. John G. Schmitz was the only other candidate on the ballot, and, as the candidate for the American Independent Party, he received just over three thousand votes. In a state that would reflect McGovern's national results, the Democratic nominee did not win a single county in Arkansas. This is also the best showing in the state by a Republican presidential candidate. , this is the last election in which Phillips County, Jefferson County, Lee County, Chicot County, and Desha County voted for a Republican presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‚ÄòHow the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century‚Äô; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Republican Ulysses S.

It is a type of abnormality of the M√ºllerian ducts. In most cases, OHVIRA presents as a double uterus with unilateral obstructed (or blind) hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis. It can also affect the urethra, urethral sphincter, ureters, bladder and spleen. Although the true incidence is unknown, it has been reported to be between 0.1% and 3%. Symptoms Although there are no specific symptoms for this condition, common complains include progressively increasing pelvic pain during menstruation and hematocolpos due to the buildup of blood in the body. Other symptoms may include swelling of the abdomen, nausea and vomiting during menstruation, and pelvic pain. Fertility may also be affected. The condition often leads to an increased need for C-sections due to the smaller uteruses. Diagnosis The condition is often diagnosed through an MRI or ultrasound. Consulting a specialist (in this case a gynecologist) is recommended. Treatment Although HWW is not curable, symptoms can be controlled with medication and surgery. In most cases, the blind hemi-vagina is opened, and the fluid drained. Antibiotics can be used for frequent urinary tract infections, and kidney transplant is sometimes indicated. Pregnancies in women with Herlyn-Werner-W√ºnderlich syndrome are categorized as high-risk due to the size and shape of the uteri and cervices as well as the reduced kidney function. Expectant mothers are often managed with cervical sutures and C-sections to prevent fetal distress during labour.

It is a tall shrub or small tree with leaves composed of three lance-shaped leaflets. In early spring there are clusters of small white flowers with four petals near the ends of the branches. Description Zieria caducibracteata is a tall shrub or small tree which grows to a height of and has its younger branches covered with short hairs. The leaves are composed of three leaflets with the leaflets narrow elliptic to lance-shaped, long and wide with a stalk long. The two surfaces of the leaflets are different shades of green, the lower surface covered with velvety hairs. The flowers are arranged in clusters which are shorter than the leaves, each flower on a stalk long. There are one or two bracts long at the base of the cluster, but the bracts fall off early in the flowering period. The sepal lobes are triangular, long and hairy. The four petals are long and covered with short, soft hairs and there are four stamens. Flowering occurs from late August to September. Taxonomy and naming Zieria caducibracteata was first formally described in 2002 by James Andrew Armstrong from a specimen collected near the Princes Highway between Milton and Lake Conjola. The description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (caducibracteata) is derived from the Latin words caducus meaning \\"deciduous\\" or \\"falling\\" and bractea meaning \\"scale\\" or \\"small leaf\\". Distribution and habitat This zieria is found between the Colo River and the Batemans Bay district in New South Wales, where it grows in forest and the edges of rainforest in sandy soil, mainly near escarpments.

The music is inspired by the writings of the famous American writer Ernest Hemingway.  Origin  The concerto was originally commissioned by the Nashville Symphony and a consortium including the Asheville Symphony, Detroit Symphony Orchestra, El Paso Symphony Orchestra, Erie Philharmonic, Redwood Symphony and Virginia Symphony Orchestra. The world premiere was given by the Nashville Symphony conducted by Giancarlo Guerrero, with cellist Zuill Bailey on April 17, 2015 at the Schermerhorn Symphony Center in downtown Nashville, Tennessee.  Performance history  The world premiere performance was reviewed by Nashville music critic John Pitcher. His analysis was that the composer \\"approached his work as a kind of sonic landscape painter [...] Cellist Zuill Bailey played throughout with a sensuous tone and technical finesse. Music director Giancarlo Guerrero and the NSO provided colorful and dramatic accompaniment.\\" The Midwest premiere was given by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Detroit Free Press music writer Mark Stryker described the work as having a \\"more soulful emotional cast...a breadth of color, texture, dynamics and feeling in the virtuoso solo writing.\\"  Recording and reception  The concerto was recorded in 2015 with the Nashville Symphony and released on the Naxos label. Many critics reviewed the recording very favorably, including a 10/10 for both categories of artistic quality and sound quality from music critic David Hurwitz. Donald Rosenberg of Gramophone wrote: In February 2017 the piece won three Grammy Awards, for Best Classical Compendium, Best Classical Instrumental Solo and Best Contemporary Classical Composition.  Four movements of the concerto  The concerto is composed in four movements, each drawn from a different work by Ernest Hemingway. The musical score includes extensive program notes written by the composer, explaining the inspiration for and design of each movement. = I. Big Two-Hearted River (Seney, Michigan, 1925) = This movement is based on Hemingway's short story about a soldier home from World War I who travels to Northern Michigan to work through his PTSD. The program notes in the musical score the composer explains that he created \\"a leitmotif [symbolizing the idea that] one can be healed by the power of nature through exploring isolated outdoor terrains.\\" = II. For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940, Spanish Civil War) = The cello represents the main character in this popular Hemingway novel, Robert Jordan. At the conclusion of the movement, the chimes are meant to represent the famous line from the novel: ‚ÄúAnd therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.‚Äù = III. The Old Man and the Sea (1952, Cuba) = This movement is an elegy representing the struggle between man and nature which is the main theme of the Hemingway novella. = IV. The Sun Also Rises (1926, Pamplona, Spain) = This movement uses heavy Spanish musical influences to represent the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain which is the setting from the Hemingway novel from which this movement takes its name.

The fleet harvested trepang, or sea cucumber, trading it to China. Pobasso was a key informant on the early Makassan relationships with Australia's Indigenous peoples prior to European settlement. Contact with Flinders On his 1803 voyage mapping the coastline of Terra Australis, Captain Matthew Flinders came upon six perahu vessels on the 17 February at the English Company's Islands' Malay Road, north of Arnhem Land. Thinking they were Chinese pirates he approached with caution. Pobasso, who Flinders described as a \\"short, elderly man\\" and five other chiefs came aboard Finders's ship the Investigator, communicating through the ship's cook who was a Malay. Flinders later went aboard Pobasso's vessel also. Pobasso educated Finders about their fleet. He said its commander-in-chief was a man named 'Salloo' and was owned by the 'Rajah of Boni'. It boasted separate divisions totaling 60 perahu and 1000 crew. Each perahu was 25 tons with a crew of 20 to 25 men. He said that he had made at least six voyages to the Australian coast over 20 years and was the first to do so. They had no knowledge of any European settlement in Australia and upon Flinders telling him about Port Jackson, Pobasso's son took notes about the settlement in \\"foreign characters, writing from left to right\\". He also claimed to never have seen another foreign ship in the waters of the northern Australian coastline. Pobasso's fleet had no charts nor were they able to make astronomical observations. They had no navigational tools other than a small compass. They carried a month's water supply in joints of bamboo as well as dried fish, coconuts, rice and poultry. Flinders noted that Pobasso carried two small brass guns, obtained from the Dutch. The other chiefs were also armed, each carrying \\"a short dagger or cress\\". Pobasso warned that his fleet \\"sometimes had skirmishes with the native inhabitants of the coast\\". He had formerly been speared in the knee, cautioning Flinders, ‚Äòbeware of the natives‚Äô. He was sketched by artist William Westall who was aboard the Investigator. Pobasso delayed his journey by a day to spend time with Flinders, accepting gifts of iron tools and a letter written in English to show to any other ships he might meet on his travels. Flinders named an island after Pobasso, Pobassoo Island. References in popular culture A fictional representation of Pobasso features in Steven Marcuson's novel The Bunting Quest.

Part I was written by series creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf and was directed by Greenwalt, in his Grimm directional debut. Part II was written by Thomas Ian Griffith and directed by executive producer Norberto Barba. The finale was originally going to be just an episode, titled \\"The Beginning of the End\\" while the first part was titled \\"Set Up\\". However, on April 30, 2016, NBC announced that the two episodes would be merged to broadcast a two-hour season finale. In the episode, Black Claw prepares to make its move now that Renard was named the mayor of Portland. Hank is arrested when two bodies appear in his house, part of the strategy taken by Black Claw. Meanwhile, Nick, Meisner and Trubel continue looking for any information regarding Conrad Bonaparte so they can stop the threat that will pose Portland forever. The season finale received enormous praise from critics, who praised the fast pace and execution of the episode, naming it among the series' best episodes. Plot =Part I= Opening quote: \\"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.\\" After Renard's (Sasha Roiz) victory, Nick (David Giuntoli) tells Meisner (Damien Puckler) and Trubel (Jacqueline Toboni) about his offer to join Black Claw. Meisner states that having a Grimm with them can be an advantage but they will kill everyone close to him. Eve (Bitsie Tulloch) announces that Zuri managed to confess the name, \\"Bonaparte\\". This instantly reminds Meisner of Conrad Bonaparte, one of the founders of Black Claw. Hank (Russell Hornsby) receives a call from the police to go to his house so he and Nick leave Hadrian's Wall. In the mansion, Diana (Hannah R. Lloyd) uses her powers to use her dolls to make Adalind (Claire Coffee) and Renard to make out. However, Adalind stops the making out and slaps Renard, causing him to furiously leave the room, being watched by Diana. At Hank's house, Nick and Hank discover that the Black Claw members that Nick killed that night are in the house and the police arrest Hank for the murders when a witness claims to have seen him. Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) confronts a group of Black Claw members outside his house and tells Trubel to find their location. Adalind sleeps with Diana that night, who confides on her that she doesn't like Rachel (Anne Leighton) because of her love for Renard. Hank is taken by two detectives to a cabin where the detectives are revealed to be Wesen and knock him out to tie him. Nick and Wu (Reggie Lee) go to question the witness but find her gone and signs of break-in in her house. Nick goes back to the precinct so the accusation gets nullified but finds Wesen working there that stop him from doing what he wants. Wu then finds that no calls were made from the witness's house. Bonaparte (Shaun Toub) meets with Adalind to discuss her awkwardness with them and to show his power, woges into a Zauberbiest and turns her into stone for a moment. He then gives her a ring, warning her not to take it off, being painful for her children. Nick and Wu decide to take Monroe to the precinct to question Tony (Joseph Kathrein), Rosalee's (Bree Turner) ex-boyfriend and member of Black Claw. Monroe acts as a furious husband to Tony and he reveals Hank's location. Nick goes with Trubel and Eve to the location to save Hank. They burst in and kill the Wesen restraining him and find the witness dead in the back of the room. Then, they realize that their sources indicated the same address and discover that they have been set up. Meanwhile, Black Claw attacks Hadrian's Wall, killing nearly everyone inside. Meisner enters the main room and finds Renard there. He answers a phone call from Eve, to inform them that it's too late and that he might die. Renard explains that they can spare him but Bonaparte enters and uses his powers to strangle Meisner while bleeding out. Renard then shoots him in the chest to end his suffering. Nick, Hank, Eve and Trubel return to Hadrian's Wall to find everyone dead. Seeing that now no one can face Black Claw, Nick tells everyone to go to his loft for safety while Trubel cries over Meisner's body. Diana uses her powers that night to strangle Rachel with her sheets and shows Adalind, shocking her. Adalind then wakes up, thinking it was a nightmare. However, Diana is seen with her woged eyes, suggesting that it was no nightmare after all. Nick, Hank and Wu arrive at the precinct where Nick locks himself with Renard in his office. Then, he attacks Renard in his office and they fight until Renard uses his powers to throw Nick through the window and has officers arrest him. Nick is taken to the jail and after a moment, sees the Black Claw symbol carved in the wall. =Part II= Opening quote: \\"All the world is a will to power...\\" Hank and Wu visit Nick in the cell, who informs them that Renard is responsible for Meisner's death and instructs them to take everyone to his loft for safety. In the bullpen, Renard calls Bonaparte to inform him of Nick's arrest and he asks for a talk with him in the precinct. Bonaparte then prepares the Wesen cops to take Nick out as soon as the process takes place. Outside Monroe's house, Eve kills the Black Claw agents watching over while Rosalee learns that she is pregnant but decides not to tell anyone yet. Trubel arrives at the house to tell them that they need to go to Nick's loft. In the loft, Eve instructs Monroe and Rosalee to hide any evidence in the spice shop from Black Claw and she, Hank and Wu head to the precinct to stop Nick from being killed by the Wesen. The precinct is bombarded with 911 calls and all the good cops leave the precinct while the Wesen take out Nick. Wu is unable to stop the Wesen from taking Nick but, as a lycanthrope, manages to kill two of them just as Hank arrives. Nick is placed on the center of the precinct where Bonaparte appears, telling him that he wants the Grimm ancestry book, torturing him with mental hallucination about Kelly. Eve and Trubel arrive and kill many of the Wesen. Eve and Bonaparte fight, ending when Bonaparte uses his powers to hit her with a shard of glass. They take her to the loft where they use the stick to heal her wounds when she begins to experience a seizure, likely because of her Hexenbiest status. After everyone meets in the loft, Diana (through a message sent by Adalind) appears to tell them that Adalind was forced to tell their location to Black Claw. Diana returns to her house where she notices a wound on Adalind's neck, who explains that daddy's \\"friend\\" did it to her. Black Claw agents arrive at the loft and Nick forces everyone to get out through the tunnels while he fights off the incoming Black Claw agents. He is shot multiple times but uses the stick to heal himself while he kills them.

Les Chappell from The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"A\\" rating and wrote, \\"The fifth season finale adds another level of interest in that 'The Beginning Of The End' is the first official two-parter that Grimms ever done, leaving aside how you choose to classify its season finale/premiere bridge episodes. Yet despite being twice the length of your normal Grimm, it never feels like it‚Äôs padded or dragging its feet, and in fact moves at the quickest pace the show's ever set. It's a finale that pays off all the rising tensions of the season and sparks every powder keg that's left to spark: there's beatings, gunfire, boiling of blood vessels, magical feuds, two miraculous resurrections, and a little girl with enough power to offset all of it. Alternatively thrilling and horrifying, it's a worthy cap to an ambitious season, continuing the show's commitment to not be business as usual.\\" Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 4 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"The finale as a whole was dramatic and fairly fast-paced. The actors for the most part did an excellent job expressing the intensity, tension, and emotion of the situation. I found the finale quite a ride ‚Äì not perfect, but it was definitely exciting and also impressed me with how far it went to completely overturn the characters' lives.\\" Lindi Smith from EW wrote, \\"Before we dive into all of the episode details, can we talk about this stellar season? It was the best yet, which is pretty impressive for a show in their fifth season. 'The Beginning of the End' was honestly one of the best season finales of any show I've ever seen, and definitely the best episode of Grimm to date. What made it so wonderful? It was truly the culmination of everything ‚Äî the fight scenes, the pace, the plot, the emotion and heart, the unpredictability, the suspense, the writing and the acting. Okay, I'll stop gushing now.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"'The Beginning of the End' was a prophetic choice of a title given the precarious state of Grimms shortened sixth season. Together, both halves of the breakneck bloodbath served to up the tension of Renard's election victory even higher while also trimming a lot of the extra crap from a series that, underneath all the excess, had good bones and a strong foundation.\\" Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, \\"The show's two- hour season five finale, however, went above and beyond what we've seen this season. Despite its extended length, the episode crammed an awful lot in, yet remained fast paced, keeping the dramatic tension high at all times.\\" References External links  Grimm (season 5) episodes 2016 American television episodes ","title":"The Beginning of the End (Grimm)"},{"id":"52797677","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Bafang is a Latin suffragan bishopric in the ecclesiastical province of the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Douala, also in Cameroon.

Khensur means \\"former abbot\\" and Rinpoche means \\"precious teacher.\\" Former Abbot of Sera Je monastery, Holder of the transmission lineage of the Kangyur, considered widely as the greatest scholar of Abhidharma of his age and, perhaps, the foremost Vajrayogini practitioner, Kyabje Khensur Kangyur Rinpoche was one of the very last great practitioners and scholars largely trained in Tibet. He was known at Sera Je as one of the \\"Three Greats.\\" Rinpoche taught all over the world including India, Australia, USA, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore. Because of his extremely high qualifications, advanced knowledge and spiritual insights so rarely found in Lama's today, Rinpoche was often requested to teach at Sera monastery, where thousands of monks flocked to hear him speak. His administrative achievements include his election first as the Sera Je disciplinarian and then, in 1982, his appointment as the monastery's abbot. His charitable achievements include the reestablishment of Sera Je School and founding of the Tibetan Sponsorship scheme. He was born to a farming family in a mountainous valley of eastern Tibet (Kham) in what is now the Kartse (Ganzi) Prefecture of Western Sichuan. This area was the birthplace of many great lamas of contemporary times, including Khensur Rinpoche Urgyen Tseten, the late Geshe Ngawang Dhargye and the late Geshe Rabten, teacher of many leading western scholars of Tibetan Buddhism. Rinpoche was not a recognised reincarnation (tulku). However, at a very early age, he displayed signs that he very likely was the reincarnation of someone of great spiritual attainment. Among these were an affinity for religious ceremonies such as pujas. Dalai Lama (left) Kyabje Rinpoche (right)  Early Life, Family and Village  Kyabje Rinpoche was born in a village called Rinda which had about 30 houses and some 300 people. Nearby was Dhargey Gompa, the local monastery. Rinpoche's family had ten members i.e. two elder sisters, himself and various other close relatives. His mother died when he was two or three years old from a disease which turned her hands black. His sister Dolma then took care of the family. His home was confiscated by the Chinese when they invaded Tibet. Rinpoches's village celebrated the various festivals including Saka Dawa, Lama Tsongkhapa Day, Jan chub cho je (celebrating the founder of Sera Monastery), Monlam and Losar (Tibetan New Year). Rinpoche was a little boy of about three when his first spiritual teacher, Kushog Gyalden Rinpoche cut his hair and gave him the name in religion, Lobsang Thubten. This was done with the understanding that he would become a monk in the future.  Dhargey Gompa and Ordination  At the age of seven he entered his first monastery Dhargey Gompa, two hours away by foot or 1/2 hour by horse, where his hair was shaved off. There were around 1900 monks from all three main Lhasa Monastic universities, including seven high Tulkus (reincarnations), and although the young monks (including Rinpoche) called themselves monks, they didn‚Äôt take the novice monk ordination (getshul) until they were older. He stayed there for 1 1/2 yrs until the Nationalist Chinese army invaded and completely destroyed the monastery. He then returned home to informal schooling. Some months later, he moved into a small school established by Gyalden Rinpoche with four other students from Dharye Gompa. Rinpoche left Dhargey in 1944 to study at Sera Monastic University in Lhasa, remaining there for 18 years. In the meantime, Dhargey Gompa was rebuilt, only to be destroyed again around 1965 by the Chinese communists. There were about 300 elder monks and 100 younger ones, under Gyalden Tulku, the current incarnation of Rinpoche's first teacher, Gyalden Rinpoche. Rinpoche returned home in 1940, his father having died six months beforehand, spending some time at the rebuilt Dhargey Gompa. In 1965, he completed his Lharampa Geshe, the highest possible degree in Buddhist Philosophic Studies.  Sera Monastery in Tibet  In February 1944, Rinpoche headed for Sera Monastery, one of three famous monasteries in Lhasa. Sera is dedicated to the Gelugpa or Yellow Hat Sect, a branch of Tibetan Buddhism and at the time Rinpoche entered, it had 5,500 monks. When he was 18 yrs old, Rinpoche took the first step to become a Novice Monk, by making three full length prostrations before the Abbot, and was asked many questions to see if he was a suitable candidate for becoming a monk. He was then given a yellow protection thread and told that he should remain humble and study well. Thus he became a full Sera Jey monk. In 1948, Rinpoche became a Gelong, a fully ordained Buddhist Monk, which meant he took the 253 precepts (vows). Mostly monks from Kham only studied in Lhasa for 3 years, then they returned to their former monastery. However, after returning from a pilgrimage, taken immediately after his full Ordination, his teachers advised him to stay at Sera longer to continue his studies and not return to Kham. By about 1949, Rinpoche was in class 5 and had about 30 students. In 1949 Rinpoche received both Yamantaka and later, Vajrayogini Initiations from Ling Rinpoche (later to become the Dalai Lamas teacher). During the next 5 years (1949‚Äì53) Rinpoche had many problems because he didn‚Äôt have any money, and had to beg for food from his friends. There wasn‚Äôt much food but he studied well because of this ... \\"they say that when you are hungry your mind is very alert\\". . In 1950 most of the monks at Sera became ill, and every day in Trehor Khamzen, 1 or 2 died, suffering from high fever. It spread through both colleges, and more than a hundred died. In 1958 the Chinese had invaded Tibet and the burning of monasteries and killing of monks had started. Cases of genocide was widespread, and the resistance movement had grown considerably.  Escape to IndiaKyabje Rinpoche and Jen Gibson, 2000 ; Unpublished Work \\"Fire and Stone; The Life of a Tibetan Abbot\\" Reproduced with permission from Tibetan Buddhist Institute  On 17 March 1959 the 14th Dalai Lama escaped in disguise and started his journey to Sikkim, India and Nepal. The day before, the Chinese had fired 2 tank bombs into the Norbulinka, and on 18 March bombs had landed at Sera, the day after he had escaped to India. The situation in Lhasa had become desperate, and Rinpoche and Geshe Ngawang Dhargey went into Lhasa to see for themselves. Because of this, they weren‚Äôt in Sera when the Chinese had come to the monastery and arrested monks coming back from the city. In Lhasa, there were bombs, tanks fire, machine guns and flame throwers, especially around the Norbulinka. A day later, Rinpoche made the decision to leave, although many others senior monks didn‚Äôt, and most perished in the ensuing onslaught. There were 35 in the group, and only 3 Senior Monks. It was an honour that Rinpoche was asked to throw the Mo to find the way to go to lead them all to safety. Chinese aircraft were patrolling to see if there were any monks escaping ... \\"it was very frightening\\". The group travelled day and night for about a month. \\"Our feet hurt, our eyes were heavy and we had pains in our legs\\" . We made it to Pempo and a Chinese plane appeared and started firing down on everyone around the village, many of whom were trying to escape. Along the way, the group came across Rinpoche's teacher, Gyume Unyen Tsetan Rinpoche, and he then joined the party, making 4 Senior Monks in all. They reached Samye in the Lodkhar area, then ferried across a very large river in a yak hide boat. It was here that fortune smiled again. After taking a short detour to visit a Tara statue, they were given as much food as the donkeys could carry. It was extremely dangerous and now urgent that they leave Lodkhar. They eventually made the border into India, and arrived 24 days after the Dalai Lama's party. The locals were amazed to see that they had travelled across the mountains in winter which were covered in ice ... this was unheard of.  Life In India  Buxa, south of Darjeeling was the area especially provided by the Indian Government for the refugees. Buxa had been a British prison for important people like Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Nehru. Many monks, including Rinpoche, developed sores, diarrhoea and tuberculosis. Many died, and the rest were emaciated. At first many different countries provided assistance but gradually the overseas countries ceased sending supplies and so it remained the Government of India's responsibility ... \\"the rest of the world forgot us\\". They stayed 11 years at Buxa and over this period the supplies became worse and worse. They were given very old, bad rice and weevily lentils. The flour was full of dead insects and everybody soon began to get sick. There were no fields to cultivate and no money. It was in the extremely harsh conditions that Rinpoche sat for his Geshe degree in 1963-4. Rinpoche had a dilemma, he could go into the study of tantra, or could stay and teach. If he didn‚Äôt teach, the teaching would degenerate. So he chose to stay and teach. In 1966, he stayed for six months in Mussoorie where he received teachings on grammar and poetry, which became useful later for writing homages to various teachers and composing texts. He wrote several Long Life Prayers, including one for the reincarnation of his first teacher in Kham. Rinpoche stayed in Buxa until 1970, studying, doing retreats and receiving initiations. Because of the deplorable conditions, and that over a hundred of the older monks had died, and many many more had tuberculosis and other diseases, he developed a plan whereby all of us were to move to the new southern settlements and re-establish Sera Jey Monastery. Divinations were performed to see where each monastery should be located, there were 2 areas; one near Mysore at Bylakuppe and the other at Mungot, both in Karnataka state. Monks from Kagur sect went to Bylakuppe.  Relocation to Sera Monastery in India  Upon arrival, the 300 monks discovered they were to live in a jungle, and stayed in army tents. The monks worked extremely hard for 2‚Äì3 years to clear it, prepare ground for planting crops and construct buildings and road. The Indian government gave them 50-60 rupees each a month for food and expenses, and also stones from a nearby quarry for building rooms (small, with just enough room for 4 beds and a fireplace for cooking). There were only two people who didn‚Äôt work; the Abbot and Rinpoche. They were designated to teach, meditate and study. The monks, out of respect, would not let Rinpoche work. A Health Care centre was established and a dispensary, and the water was much better, and Tuberculous became slightly less prevalent, however fever, malaria, tropical sores and other illnesses from the warm climate was still present. =Oral Transmission of the Complete Works of the Teachings of the Buddha= In April 1972, Rinpoche was asked to give the Oral Transmission of the Complete Works of the Teachings of the Buddha, 108 volumes each 400 to 500 pages, which took about 8 months, and given in Dharmsala. This is an extremely rare teaching, and for this reason he now bears the title of Kangyurwa. After completing the Kangurwa, he returned to Sera in early 1973 and was appointed by the Dalai Lama to the position of Gigue, Disciplinarian of Sera Je. It is usual to be in this position for 6 months, however Rinpoche held the position for 2 years. It was at this time that Tenzin (Nawang Thubten), Rinpoche's attendant, became a monk. He was only 5 years old at the time. =Roles= Rinpoche was both Sera disciplinarian and teacher at Sera. As Gigue, Rinpoche was able to start up again the debating system used at Sera in Tibet. These debates provide an excellent means of exploring the teachings of the Buddha and expanding one's knowledge of them. In December 1979, Rinpoche started a 3.3 year retreat on Vajrayogini. During this time, Rinpoche was visited by Ling Rinpoche and Trichang Dorje Chang, the Dalai Lama's tutors. He was very honoured by this visit and rare to have a visitor whilst on a retreat. In 1982, after finishing the retreat, Rinpoche was asked to teach at Tushita Institute in New Delhi, which was for local Indians and Westerners. Rinpoche had first taught western monks Buddhist philosophy in Sera Je before going to Tushita Centre. The current Abbot at Sera asked to be excused from his position, so they had to appoint a new one. The monks vote first, and Geshe Rabten received the most, then Rinpoche. The highest six names are then taken to Dharmsala and presented to the Dalai Lama. Through his divination, Rinpoche was chosen as Abbot of Sera from July 1983 until June 1987. The Abbot has to take care of everything, including the overseeing the building projects, the buying of supplies for the monastery, meeting with business people and many meetings of the various Abbots to decide the future of the study programs in India. =Sera Je School= In 1984, during his time as abbot, Rinpoche restructured Sera Je School, which has resulted in an extremely high standard and diverse curriculum, achieving exemplary results in examinations. Because it was only for monks, many children from the nearby Tibetan settlements became monks in order to attend.  Australia  In 1986, when Jampa Gendun (Australian monk) arrived with a letter requesting Rinpoche to teach in the West ... \\"I was asked to stay for 3 years, but I thought 1 year would be enough, however His Holiness advised that perhaps I should stay for 2 years\\". He then spent 6 months teaching at Kopan Monastery, and from there travelled down to Delhi, then to Singapore and Adelaide arriving on 11 September 1988. Rinpoche eventually spent over 2 decades in Australia. = Buddhahouse = Rinpoche settled in Adelaide South Australia to teach at Buddha-house, an FPMT centre in Fullarton. Rinpoche was asked to teach at many other FPMT centres in Australasia and overseas. By doing this, Rinpoche was fulfilling the wish of the 14th Dalai Lama, to spread the Buddha Dharma to as many sentient beings as possible. Rinpoche taught twice a week on most of the Buddhist Canon, and gave many Initiations and retreats. Rinpoche initially only planned to teach at BuddhaHouse in Adelaide for a year, but stayed as the resident spiritual teacher for over a decade. Under Rinpoche's guidance, BuddhaHouse grew in stability, prosperity and educational strength. = 1992 Visit of the Dalai Lama to Australia = A highlight of Rinpoche's Australian stay was the visit in May 1992 of the Dalai Lama to Australia. As the senior resident monk it was Rinpoche's privilege to welcome him and accompany him around much of the country. \\"To be here in a western city so far away from Tibet welcoming the Dalai Lama was very strange. In Tibet it was almost impossible to sit next to him as I did in the Adelaide cathedral, and making a speech of welcome would have been impossible\\".  Tibetan Buddhist Institute (TBI)  The Tibetan Buddhist Institute was established in April 2005 by Kyabje Rinpoche, in order to fulfil the wishes of the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. In March 2009, Tibetan Buddhist Institute found a home with the purchase of the Uniting Church building at Flinders Park South Australia. =Geshe Jampa Gyaltsen= Kyabje Rinpoche (left) and Geshe Jampa Gyaltsen (right) Geshe Jampa Gyaltsen is a student of Rinpoche and is now the resident teacher at Tibetan Buddhist Institute. Geshe Jampa Gyaltsen was born in 1966 and raised in the Tibetan village of Rumbatsa, within the broader district of Trƒõhor Kham, original site of the now legendary Dhargyay Monastery, and birthplace of founder Khensur Kangyurwa Rinpoche Lobsang Thubten, along with several other great Tibetan scholar-yogis of the 20th century. =Dalai Lama Visit to Tibetan Buddhist Institute= Dalai Lama at Tibetan Buddhist Institute June 2013 At the request of Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama visited the Tibetan Buddhist Institute in Adelaide Australia on Thursday 20 June 2013.  Charitable Works  = Tibetan Sponsorship Scheme = In response the many requests from senior monks for assistance, Rinpoche established a monk sponsorship scheme. With over 950 monks, nuns, lay Tibetans in India and Gyalten Charity School in Tibet on the scheme (December 2005) and over 550 sponsors from 6 countries, the Khensur Kangyurwa Rinpoche Sponsorship Schemes is perhaps the largest and among the most successful Tibetan Sponsorship schemes in the world today. The Tibetan sponsorship scheme (previously Monk Sponsorship Scheme) was originally established to help support exiled monks at Sera Monastery escaping repression in Tibet, and also their relatives who live nearby in camps in India. Today the scheme sponsors exiled Monks, Nuns and lay Tibetans in India, Nuns, at two nunneries in Tibet, and students at Gyalten Charity School in Tibet. = Monastery in Kham, Dhargye Gompa = Rinpoche has also successfully helped to raise funds to rebuild his first monastery in Kham, Dhargye Gompa, which was destroyed twice during the Chinese invasion and occupation. In addition, he has raised money to support the important philosophical debating program at Sera Je. Gyalten Charity School in Tibet has approximately 280 children are enrolled in the school. Mostly monks are sponsored in Rinpoche's schemes, however there are also nuns in India as well as nuns at Nyagye Nunnery in Tibet and many Lay Tibetans in India. Khensur Rinpoche also set up the Emergency Medical Fund, which was established for any monk or lay Tibetan in India that is in urgent need of medical assistance.  Death and Reincarnation  Cremation Ceremony Sera Monastery On 31 December 2013, the Dalai Lama, personally visited the former abbot of Sera Je Monastery, Thubten Rinpoche just prior to his death (video) at his Labrang. After meeting with Kyabje Khensur Kangyur Rinpoche, before the beginning of the Lam Rim teachings, in front of approximately 10,000 monks and lay people the Dalai Lama detailed Khensur Rinpoche's realizations stating: \\"His entire life was dedicated to Dharma from childhood. He has all the qualities of Scripture and Realization\\" before mentioning his advanced realizations of the Completion Stage of Heruka. Rinpoche died on 22 January 2014 in India. The cremation ceremony and offering of a fire puja to Kyabje Khensur Kangur Lobsang Thubten Rinpoche's Holy Body, was held at Sera Monastery and attended by hundreds of monks and lay people. In January 2016 one hundred Geshes in Rinpoche's Labrang at Sera Jey Monastic University dedicated a Heruka Guru Puja for his reincarnation. The 14th Dalai Lama informed that there weren‚Äôt any obstacles to the reincarnation, wherever that may be, of Lobsang Thubten. He advised that Rinpoche has appeared, but \\"there is no rush to find him\\". Kyabje Rinpoche's death was reported in the tributes section of the Adelaide Advertiser in 2014 (citation required).

The islands, still hosting Soviet Russian troops, were first invaded by Kingdom of Sweden in late February and then by the German Empire in early March. The conflict was also related to the Finnish Civil War including minor fighting between the Finnish Whites and the Finnish Reds. As Germany took control over √Öland in March 1918, Russian troops were captured and the Swedish troops left the islands by the end of the Finnish Civil War in May. The Germans stayed in √Öland until September 1918. The √Öland Islands dispute was then turned over to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and the League of Nations in 1920. The √Öland convention was finally signed in 1921 re-establishing the demilitarised status of √Öland as an autonomous part of Finland.  Background  The √Öland Islands are located in the northern Baltic Sea between Sweden and Finland. The population is Swedish-speaking, but after the 1809 Treaty of Fredrikshamn the islands were ceded to the Russian Empire together with a vast majority of the Finnish-speaking areas of Sweden, becoming the Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. In the 1856 Treaty of Paris, settling the Crimean War, the √Öland Islands were demilitarised. As World War I broke out in 1914, the Russian Empire turned the islands into a submarine base for the use of British and Russian navies. On 25 July 1916, the German airship SL9 attacked the port of Mariehamn and bombed the boats of the Russian 5th submarine squadron and the mothership Svjatitel Nikolai, resulting the death of 7 Russian sailors. The Russian government also started building fortifications, in agreement with their allies France and Great Britain, in order to prevent the German invasion. √Öland Islands were fortified with 10 coastal artillery batteries, several garrisons, docks and two airfields. Sweden, however, considered the structures too heavy for just defending the islands. The government feared a possible attack from √Öland, and so the neutral Sweden felt pressured to join the Allied Powers. It did not however do so.  Outbreak of the Finnish Civil War  As Finland gained its independence from Russia in December 1917, a movement was launched in √Öland to join the islands to Sweden. The Swedish government had an audience with a delegation from √Öland calling action on the question. After the Finnish Civil War started in late January 1918, the Swedish prime minister Johannes Hellner and the king Gustaf V had an audience with a delegation from √Öland on 8 February. According to the delegation, a referendum had been held in √Öland and a vast majority of 95% was willing to join Sweden. The delegation called for action on the cause and asked help from the Swedish government against the alleged arbitrary and disorder of the Russian troops. The Swedish newspapers also pressed for action because of the humanitarian reasons. Since the beginning of the war, the government had already evacuated more than 1,000 Swedish citizens from the Finnish mainland via the west coast town of Pori. The Finnish Civil War expanded to √Öland on 10 February, as a squad of 460 White Guard members, led by the captain Johan Fabritius, from the Vakka-Suomi region landed the islands. The group had fled three days earlier from the town of Uusikaupunki and crossed the ice of the Archipelago Sea. After reaching √Öland, the Whites had some minor clashes with troops supporting Lenin's Russian Government. On 14 February, they took the Pr√§st√∂ telegraph station in Sund, capturing 20 Russian soldiers. The Russians, however, had not much interest in resistance. They were mostly waiting to return home.  The Swedish invasion  On 13 February, Swedish government finally decided to send troops to √Öland. Two days later, a naval detachment of the icebreaker Isbrytaren I, the coastal defense ship HSwMS Thor and the troopship SS Runeberg docked Ecker√∂ in the Swedish side of the islands. A small military unit landed in √Öland in order to protect the people from alleged misconduct of the Russian troops as well as from the violent threat of the Finnish sides of the Civil War. The Whites incorrectly assumed the Swedes had come to join them. Encouraged by this, the Whites took the artillery batteries in Box√∂ and Sagg√∂, but instead of supporting them, the Swedes started negotiations with the Russians. The negotiation was stopped on 17 February, as 150-men Red Guard unit from Turku arrived in √Öland with the icebreaker Murtaja. Their intention was to help the Russians in the presumed fight against the Swedes and the Whites. On the same day, the Whites took the village of Godby in Finstr√∂m but the Soviets troops were able to keep the village of Jomala and the artillery fort of S√•lis. Two days later, the Reds made a counterattack against Godby, but were pushed back. The Battle of Godby ended with 2 killed Whites and 3 killed Reds. 8 captured Reds was later executed. It remained the only Finnish Civil War battle fought in √Öland. German troops landing by the Ecker√∂ Mail and Customs House As the situation in √Öland had now escalated to open violence, the Swedes intervened the situation with a counterfeit order by the White Army commander C. G. E. Mannerheim calling the Whites to retreat from √Öland. In reality, general Mannerheim wanted the Whites to take control of all the islands and then launch an offensive against Turku, the Red capital of Southwest Finland. As the Whites did not know Mannerheim's real intentions, they followed the false order and left √Öland on 20 February. As the White Finland found out about the Swedish conduct, they gave a strict objection. The Swedish government now had to convince that their purpose was not to join the islands to Sweden, but only to protect the Swedish-speaking people of √Öland. On 19 February, HSwMS Sverige and HSwMS Oscar II carrying a company from the Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment arrived at √Öland to press the Soviets in leaving the islands. The Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet still tried to avoid the armed conflict and on 22 February the political representative Vatslav Vorovsky stated the Soviets troops were willing to leave √Öland. The order of disarmament was given a day after and the Finnish icebreaker Murtaja took 300 Russian Bolsheviks and the Finnish Red Guard fighters to Turku. On 24 February, the 500-man battalion of the Royal G√∂ta Life Guards, commanded by the lieutenant colonel G. E. Ros, landed at Ecker√∂ and by the 2 March, the Swedes controlled all the islands, although there were still up to 1,200 disarmed Russian soldiers present.  The German invasion  Captured Soviets are escorted to Ecker√∂ The armistice between Russia and Germany lapsed on 18 February 1918 and the Operation Faustschlag was soon launched by the Germans. This included the invasion of √Öland, as the Germans did not know whether Sweden would remain neutral or join the Allies. The Germans had their interests in Finland because of the access to the Arctic Sea and the country's presence near the Murmansk railway and the Bolshevik capital of Saint Petersburg. To justify the invasion, Germany ordered a request of military assistance from their allies in Finland. The White Senate message requesting the German invasion of √Öland reached Berlin on 22 February. The German intention was to gather troops to √Öland and then land the Finnish mainland in the west coast town of Rauma. As the ice in the Bothnian Bay was too thick, the landing was finally made in Hanko, Southern Finland, by the Baltic Sea Division in the first days of April. On 28 February, a naval unit of the battleships SMS Westfalen and SMS Rheinland, commanded by the admiral Hugo Meurer, left Danzig to √Öland. The ships were carrying the Gro√üherzoglich Mecklenburgisches J√§ger-Bataillon Nr. 14, under the command of the major August Schenck zu Schweinsberg. The convoy was slowed down by the heavy ice, but finally the Aalands-Detachement reached Ecker√∂ on 5 March. The following day, the Swedes were forced to make a deal with the Germans. According to the agreement, Sweden and Germany now shared the √Öland Islands. The Swedes had a hold on the capital Mariehamn and the villages of Jomala, Geta and Finstr√∂m. Both were allowed to use the port of Ecker√∂. A post of the Finnish military governor was established and filled by the naval officer Hjalmar von Bonsdorff as the representative of the White Senate. The Germans captured up to 1,000‚Äì1,200 Soviet soldiers which were shipped to LiepƒÅja. 250 Ukrainian, Polish, Latvian and Estonian soldiers of the Soviet army were placed to an internment camp in Sweden. These soldiers were later handed over to Germans and transported to Sassnitz in Northern Germany. In Mariehamn, the Germans took several Russian warships and the Finnish steamer SS Baltic. On 10 March, the Finnish Reds proposed negotiations with the Germans over their potential threat against Turku, the Red capital of Southeast Finland. The Germans agreed to meet the Red delegation in √Öland if they would bring the POWs kept in Turku. In 1918 the Russians exchanged more than 65,000 wounded and invalid German POWs via Finland. The Red delegation including the socialist philosopher Georg Boldt and the Turku militia leader William Lundberg, together with 260 POWs, travelled across the ice by horse- drawn sleigh. On 15 March, Boldt and Lundberg had a meeting with the Germans. However, the Reds were told that since the Germans were invited by the Whites, they could not discuss their intentions. Boldt and Lundberg were then escorted back to the mainland. In late March, the Germans launched a campaign in the Turku archipelago to secure the left wing of the forthcoming Baltic Sea Division landing in Hanko. The plan was to reach Turku from √Öland via the islands of Houtsk√§r, Korpo, Nagu and Pargas. Houtsk√§r was taken by the Finnish Whites on 25 March and Korpo on 28 March, but the Reds stopped the German troops in the Battle of Nagu on 4 April. The Germans then left the archipelago and focused on the march from Hanko to Helsinki.  Aftermath  Sweden pulled most of their troops from √Öland on 14 March, but the ship Oscar II and one small military unit stayed until the end of the Finnish Civil War. The last Swedes retreated on 26 May 1918. The Germans stayed in the √Öland Islands until September 1918. After the war, Sweden was still willing to take the √Öland Islands and wanted to solve the dispute in the Treaty of Versailles, but the question was not included. A new referendum was held in 1919 and now 9,900 of the 10,000 voters wanted to join Sweden. A year later, Great Britain took the case to the newly founded League of Nations. In June 1921, √Öland was declared as a demilitarised and autonomous territory of Finland.  Casualties  During their seven-month military campaign in √Öland, the Germans lost six men. Three of them were killed on 9 March as the icebreaker Hindenburg struck a mine off Ecker√∂ and sunk. Two sailors drowned on 11 April when the SMS Rheinland grounded between the islands of L√•gsk√§r and Fl√∂tjan. In addition to the casualties in √Öland, seven Germans were killed in the Battle of Nagu in the Turku Archipelago. Swedish casualties were one man as an infantry sergeant committed suicide in April. The Whites had three killed in the Battle of Godby, two in the Battle of Korpo and one in the Battle of Nagu. The number of killed Russian Bolshevik soldiers is not clear but at least two soldiers died in the clashes against the Finnish Whites. One Soviet and one Finnish Red were shot by the Whites in late March as they were captured near the island of V√•rd√∂. The order was given by the Finnish military governor Hjalmar von Bonsdorff and the execution was carried out by the Whites occupying the Turku Archipelago. In addition to the 3 Reds killed in the Battle of Godby, 8 captured Reds were shot by the Whites in the ice of F√§rjsundet Strait. At least 26 also died in the Battle of Nagu and 7 in the Battle of Korpo.

The music is inspired by both the life and times of American media mogul William Randolph Hearst, Hearst Castle, and the Hollywood lore of Charles Foster Kane, a fictional character based on Hearst in the movie Citizen Kane.  Origin and performance history  The composition was commissioned by the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra and a consortium consisting of the Cedar Rapids Symphony Orchestra, the Rockford Symphony Orchestra and the West Michigan Symphony Orchestra. The world premiere was given by the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arie Lipsky, with Steven Ball, organ, at the Michigan Theater, Ann Arbor, Michigan on November 15, 2003. The world premiere of the revised version was given by the Nashville Symphony conducted by Giancarlo Guerrero, with Paul Jacobs, organ, at the Schermerhorn Symphony Center, Nashville, Tennessee on November 6, 2015.  Recording and reception The concerto was recorded in 2015 with the Nashville Symphony and released on the Naxos label. Many critics reviewed the recording favorably, including a 10/10 for both categories of artistic quality and sound quality from music critic David Hurwitz and 4 out of 5 stars from critic James Manheim. Donald Rosenberg of Gramophone wrote: Bob McQuiston of Classial Lost and Found wrote: The album won the 2017 Grammy Award for Best Classical Compendium.  Four movements of the composition  The music of the four movements is programmatic, and is based on the composer's framing of different architectural, geographical and fictional aspects of the Hearst/Kane history and lore. The composer's published score includes descriptive program notes explaining the imagery and inspiration for each movement. = I. The Road to San Simeon = The music of this movement is meant to represent the winding drive to Hearst Castle from San Simeon. Hearst's opulent antique collection. The composer explains his intent for his music in this movement to occasionally remind the listener of a musical ‚Äúantique‚Äù. = II. Neptune Pool = This movement is dedicated to William Albright (1944-98), who was the composer's colleague at the University of Michigan and who is recognized as one of the 20th century's greatest composers of contemporary organ music. The music is meant to portray the vast, grandiose architecture of the famous pool at Hearst Castle. = III. Rosebud = In his program notes the composer states: \\"...the ground breaking film [Citizen Kane] starring and directed by Orson Welles, presents a caricature of Randolph Hearst...[the] music for this movement echoes a brilliant scene in the film where the boisterous Kane (the organ) and lonely Susan (the solo violin) argue from opposite ends of a cavernous empty room of the castle.\\" Sleigh bells are used as a musical representation of \\"rosebud,\\" the famous final word of the fictional character Citizen Kane. = IV. Xanadu = This movement is composed to capture the spirit of the bombastic, lavish parties famously held at Hearst Castle, the likes of which Winston Churchill and famous film stars of the day including Clark Gable, Charlie Chaplin, and Greta Garbo attended. The composer notes in the published score, \\"I also had in mind fragments of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 1798 poem, Kubla Khan...[the music uses] virtuoso bass pedal riffs surrounded by sizzling strings, rumbling brass, shimmering percussion and pulsating timpani.‚Äù  References  Concertante symphonies 2003 compositions 2015 compositions ","title":"Once Upon a Castle"},{"id":"52797765","text":"In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257 (1948), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court involving the application of the right of due process in state court proceedings. The Sixth Amendment in the Bill of Rights states that criminal prosecutions require the defendant \\"... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation...and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\\" In this case, a witness in a Michigan grand jury hearing was convicted and sentenced to jail without either notice or attorney assistance. Prior history On September 11, 1946 William Oliver was summoned by subpoena to a grand jury in Oakland County, Michigan. Circuit Court Judge George B. Hartrick had been appointed as a one-man secret grand jury to investigate organized crime participation in local gambling and public corruption. A local pinball operator, Oliver was examined under oath as a witness and was not accused of any crime or represented by an attorney. At the conclusion of his testimony, Hartrick and two other circuit judges (who were not members of the grand jury but present as advisors) agreed that Oliver had given \\"false and evasive answers\\" to Hartrick's questions. Without pausing the proceeding or permitting Oliver counsel, Hartrick convicted Oliver of contempt of court and sentenced him to 60 days in the county jail. After three days, Oliver was able to secure an attorney who filed for writs of Habeas corpus and certiorari to the Michigan Supreme Court challenging the conviction. Because Michigan state law authorizing the one-man grand jury proceedings allowed judge/grand jury to punish contempt at their sole discretion, The Michigan Supreme Court dismissed Oliver's due process claims as being \\"without merit\\" and upheld the conviction and sentence. Decision The United States Supreme Court took the case in part to decide if, contrary to the lower Court's opinion, the Sixth Amendment protections applied to state court hearings. The Court's majority opinion began by evaluating the Michigan one-man grand jury process, calling it \\"unique\\" and \\"peculiar.\\" The Court had long accepted that grand juries, operating as investigative tools, needed and were allowed to operate in secrecy. The Michigan grand jury law, however, impermissibly mixed this traditional investigative function with circuit court conviction and punishment. It held that: * The secrecy of the (irregular and abbreviated) trial for criminal contempt violated the due process clause :*The need for secrecy of grand jury investigative proceedings did not justify secrecy in accusing Oliver of an offense for which he faced jail time :*An accused is entitled to a public trial no matter the offense charged *The failure to afford Oliver a reasonable opportunity to defend himself against the contempt charge was a denial of due process of law :*At a minimum due process required reasonable notice, the right to examine the witnesses, the right to testify, and the right to counsel :*The judgment of Hartrick that Oliver committed contempt of court in the court's actual presence was insufficient justification to deny Oliver these rights The Michigan Supreme Court and Oakland County Circuit Court rulings were overturned. Justice Black likened the Michigan grand jury's discretionary contempt convictions to English Star Chamber secret convictions and French pre-Revolutionary lettres de cachet allowing imprisonment without the opportunity for defense. Effects of the decision Michigan later eliminated one-person grand juries. Michigan law currently requires citizen's grand juries presided over by a circuit judge.

The album consists of live recordings produced by Manson directly from his cell in the California Medical Facility in 1983. As a result, the tracks suffer from poor sound quality, and various noises from the penitentiary interject throughout the album. All of the material on Live at San Quentin was distributed earlier on the rare cassette White Rasta.  Background  Faced with serving a life sentence for conspiracy to commit the murders of seven people, Manson was transferred from Folsom State Prison to California Medical Facility (CMF) in March 1974 as his mental condition showed signs of deteriorating. He was returned to Folsom in October 1974, but was transferred yet again to CMF two years later, where he remained incarcerated for nine years. The contents of the album consists of material Manson recorded, while accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, on a portable cassette tape deck during a lock-up at CMF. Because of the settings at the time of recording and the rudimentary equipment used, much of Live at San Quentin's contents are interrupted by inmate bantering and various noises. Although some tracks like \\"My Name Is Sam McGee\\", \\"Boxcar Willy and Big Bad Joe\\", and \\"Marilyn Monroe Was My Childhood Shame\\" make references to pop culture, much of the material manifests itself from Manson's improvisatory declarations.  Release  Of the 13 tracks that make up Live at San Quentin, all of them were first introduced on the cassette tape White Rasta in the late 1980s. Directed by Manson Family members \\"Ansom 13\\" and \\"TJ\\", a limited edition of 500 tapes were intended for distribution, but that number dwindled to 250 copies. It features the same cover design as Manson's \\"I'm on Fire\\" single. However, White Rasta is nearly impossible to obtain and is currently out of print. Live at San Quentin was released in 1993 by Grey Matter Records (including a limited edition \\"yellow\\" version) on vinyl LP and CD. Cover art for the album parodies Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys, whose drummer Dennis Wilson briefly befriended Manson. Sleevenotes are brandished with an excerpt of Manson proclaiming his innocence and also elaborates on the album's unconventional track listing. Noting the situation in which the album was recorded, a review on the Allmusic website commented \\"the authenticity of Charles Manson Live at San Quentin places it with other historic prison recordings, even as it occupies a micro- genre all its own\\". Stephen Kaplan, distributor of Lie: The Love and Terror Cult in the 1980s, wrote \\"Kids buy it thinking they are going to get devil- worship music.

He joined a volunteer regiment in 1792 and fought on the Rhine and in Italy as a captain. After a stint in the Consular Guard as a major, he became colonel of the 9th Light Infantry Regiment in 1803. His regiment fought at Haslach and D√ºrenstein in 1805, Halle, Waren and L√ºbeck in 1806, and Mohrungen and Friedland in 1807. Transferred to Spain, he led his troops at Ucl√©s, Medell√≠n and Talavera in 1809. He was promoted general of brigade in 1810 and fought at Barrosa in 1811. He participated in the French invasion of Russia in 1812. He led a brigade at L√ºtzen, Bautzen, the Katzbach and Leipzig in 1813. He was appointed general of division at the end of 1813 and led a Young Guard division at Brienne, La Rothi√®re, Champaubert, Montmirail, Ch√¢teau-Thierry, Vauchamps, Craonne, Laon and Reims in 1814. He married a daughter of painter Jacques- Louis David. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 30. Early career Meunier was born on 4 August 1770 to a family of modest means in Saint-Amour in what later became the Jura department. He enlisted in the 10th Jura Volunteer Battalion on 5 August 1792 and became a captain seven days later. He fought with the Army of the Rhine from 1792 to 1794. He was wounded in the left thigh by a bullet on 13 October 1793 at the First Battle of Wissembourg. He transferred to the Army of Italy where he served from 1794 to 1797. On 14 May 1797 Meunier was a grenadier captain in the 1st Battalion of the 69th Demi-Brigade. He transferred to the Army of the Orient and fought in the French campaign in Egypt and Syria in 1798‚Äì1801. He became captain in the Foot Guides on 20 January 1799 and was promoted to chef de bataillon (major) on 17 February 1800. During the occupation of Egypt, the French generals formed two quarreling factions, those supporting the army commander Jacques-Fran√ßois Menou and those backing Jean Reynier. Fearing that the opposing faction was about to depose him, Menou sent Jacques Zacharie Destaing with more than 350 soldiers and a cannon to surround Reynier's house on 13 April 1801. An officer named Novel burst into the room where Reynier, Fran√ßois √âtienne Damas and others were meeting and demanded that they surrender their weapons. When they refused, Novel brought in some Foot Guides and shouted \\"Bourrez-moi ces bougres\\" (Fuck me these buggers)! The officers in the room drew their swords. Reynier aimed a pistol at Novel and promised to fire if that officer made a move. Bloodshed was avoided when a quick-thinking Meunier ordered his Foot Guides out of the room, then politely requested Reynier and his colleagues to submit to their commander-in-chief. Reynier and the others gave in at once and were placed aboard a ship heading to France. On 30 August 1801, Menou surrendered Egypt to a British expedition. The Foot Guides were renamed the Foot Chasseurs of the Consular Guard on 22 December 1801. Meunier subsequently served with the Army of the Ocean Coasts. He was promoted colonel of the 9th Light Infantry Regiment on 23 December 1803. He received the Officer's Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur on 14 June 1804. He married √âmilie David on 27 March 1805. She was the daughter of the famous painter Jacques-Louis David. Empire =1805‚Äì1807: Germany= Meunier served in the division of Pierre Dupont de l'√âtang in the 1805‚Äì1807 campaigns. On 11 October 1805, the 9th Light Infantry fought at the Battle of Haslach- Jungingen as part of Dupont's 1st Division of Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps. During this remarkable action, Dupont's 5,350 infantry, 2,169 cavalry and 18 guns held off 25,000 Austrians under Karl Mack von Leiberich. The division was involved in a mopping-up action at Herbrechtingen on 17 October. Dupont's division fought at the Battle of D√ºrenstein on 11 November. The 9th Light Infantry captured two colors from the Russian Viatka Musketeer Regiment during the action. Meunier became a commander of the L√©gion d'honneur on 25 December 1805. On 17 October 1806, the 9th Light Infantry fought in the Battle of Halle as part of Marie Fran√ßois Rouyer's brigade. Dupont's division was part of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's I Corps. The French inflicted 5,000 casualties on the Prussians while only sustaining losses of 800 killed and wounded. Meunier was wounded in the chest on this day. His regiment lost three officers and a number of men in the Battle of Waren-Nossentin on 1 November. Dupont's division was held in reserve at the Battle of L√ºbeck on 6 November. The I Corps fought in the Battle of Mohrungen on 25 January 1807. Dupont's division was involved in a skirmish at Braniewo (Braunsberg) on 26 February. The I Corps under Claude Perrin Victor fought at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807. At Friedland, Dupont's division performed noteworthy service in breaking the Russian center. =1808‚Äì1812: Spain= At the Battle of Ucl√©s on 13 January 1809, the division under Fran√ßois Amable Ruffin, formerly Dupont's, conducted a successful envelopment of the Spanish right flank. In the Battle of Medell√≠n on 29 March, Ruffin's division remained in reserve. During the Battle of Talavera on 27‚Äì28 July 1809, Marshal Victor ordered Ruffin's division to conduct a night assault on the British-held Cerro de Medellin. Ruffin placed Meunier's 9th Light in the center with the 24th Line to the right and 96th Line to the left. At 9:00 pm the columns descended from the French-held height, called the Cascajal, and began the attack. The 9th Light advanced in battalion columns with the battalions one behind the other. As it happened, the 24th Line got lost in the dark and never attacked while the 96th Line struggled to cross the ravine and only skirmished with the British. On the other hand, the 9th Light rapidly crossed the ravine and ascended the Cerro, striking the 7th Line Battalion of the King's German Legion. The German unit had its pickets placed too close so that the battalion was overrun within a few minutes, losing 150 casualties including many prisoners. As the two leading French battalions reached the top of the Cerro, the British division commander Rowland Hill rode up to them and was nearly captured. Though an officer with him was killed, Hill galloped away in the dark, rallied a nearby brigade and led them to retake the hilltop. The first British battalion to reach the top was stopped cold in a close-range musketry duel. When the other two British battalions arrived, the French were beaten and fled down the slope. The stray third battalion of the 9th Light soon joined the others in retreat. Meunier was shot in the head and the left leg. The 9th Light suffered about 300 casualties, including the badly-wounded Meunier and 65 others who were captured. A few days later, Talavera de la Reina was abandoned by the Spanish; Meunier and other wounded prisoners in the hospitals were liberated by the French. Meunier was promoted general of brigade on 8 January 1810. He directed the converged grenadier battalion of Jean Fran√ßois Leval's division at the Battle of Barrosa on 5 March 1811. The grenadiers were held in reserve and when the division was beaten, the grenadiers covered the retreat of the 54th Line Infantry Regiment. The source mistakenly identified Meunier as a colonel. On 1 March 1812, Meunier led the 1st Brigade in Nicolas Fran√ßois Conroux's 1st Division of Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult's Army of the South. The brigade included two battalions of the 9th Light Infantry Regiment and three battalions of the 24th Line Infantry Regiment. Together with Georges Alexis Mocquery's 2nd Brigade (96th Line), the division numbered 182 officers and 5,263 men. Soon afterward, he traveled to Paris where his father-in-law painted his portrait. He then joined the army preparing to invade Russia. =1812‚Äì13: Russia and Germany= Meunier fought in Russia, but the source does not state with which corps he served. In the Battle of L√ºtzen on 2 May 1813, Meunier led a brigade in the 36th Infantry Division under Henri Fran√ßois Marie Charpentier in Marshal Jacques MacDonald's XI Corps. The units in his brigade that were engaged were three battalions of the 14th Provisional Demi- Brigade. At about 5:30 pm in the afternoon, Charpentier's division came into action on the extreme French left flank, preceded by a bombardment from the corps artillery. The 36th Division's 1st Brigade advanced against the village of Eisdorf while the 2nd Brigade attacked Kleing√∂rschen. Eisdorf was seized by the French, but the French Imperial Guard had to intervene in the struggle before Kleing√∂rschen finally fell. On 20‚Äì21 May, the 14th and 15th Provisional Demi-Brigades fought at the Battle of Bautzen. On the first day, the XI Corps attacked the Allied center and captured the town of Bautzen. MacDonald's XI Corps continued attacking the Allied center on the second day, but Napoleon intended it to be a holding attack to distract the Allied generals from seeing the real threat to their right flank. The 36th Division fought in the Battle of Katzbach on 26 August. At the Battle of Leipzig on 16‚Äì19 October, Meunier's brigade in the 36th Division was made up of the 3rd and 4th battalions of the 3rd Light Infantry and the 3rd, 4th and 7th battalions of the 14th Light Infantry. Meunier was shot in the right arm on 16 October. He was promoted general of division on 5 November 1813. =1814: France= Since the 1814 campaign was fought January‚ÄìMarch, Meunier's infantrymen wore greatcoats if they were lucky. On 6 January 1814, Meunier's 1st Young Guard Voltiguer Division, with 5,250 men, was located near Nancy. On 11 January, the Allies roughly handled Guillaume-Charles Rousseau's brigade of the division during its retreat from √âpinal. Soon after, Marshal Michel Ney arrived to take command of Meunier's division and other units. On 25 January 1814, Meunier's 1st Young Guard Division had two brigades, as follows. Jean √âtienne Cl√©ment- Lacoste's brigade consisted of the 1st Voltiguer Regiment, 657 men, and the 2nd Voltiguer Regiment, 940 men. Rousseau's brigade was composed of the 3rd Voltiguers, 1,263 men, and the 4th Voltiguers, 1,144 men. Each regiment had two battalions and 140 gunners and artillery drivers were attached. At the Battle of Brienne on 29 January, Meunier's division attacked the village of Brienne-le-Ch√¢teau after nightfall but was unable to oust its Russian defenders. The division numbered about 3,000 men at the Battle of La Rothiere on 1 February. Meunier's troops became involved in the left flank fighting before being forced to withdraw. At the start of the Six Days' Campaign, Ney's corps included Meunier's division with 4,133 soldiers and Philibert Jean- Baptiste Curial's 2nd Young Guard Division with 2,840 men. In the Battle of Champaubert on 10 February 1814, Marmont's corps led the attack, but Ney's corps became involved in the fighting after 11:00 am. At the Battle of Montmirail the next day, Meunier's division was engaged in a bitter struggle against the Russians at the village of Marchais-en-Brie. On 12 February, the 1st Young Guard Division joined in the pursuit of the Allies in the Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry. At the Battle of Vauchamps two days later, Ney's corps was present but not engaged. The Guard was in reserve at the Battle of Montereau on 18 February 1814. At the Battle of Craonne on 7 March, Ney attacked prematurely on the right flank without artillery support, throwing Meunier's division at the Chemin des Dames ridge near Ailles around 9:00 am. Consequently, the 1st Young Guard Division suffered heavy losses. At 11:30 am after the French guns belatedly began bombarding the Russian position, Ney personally led Meunier's depleted division forward and they secured a foothold on the high ground. Despite cavalry support, Meunier's troops were driven off the ridge at 1:00 pm, but an hour later they won another foothold. As the Russians stubbornly retreated, Ney's survivors followed. At this time the 1st Young Guard Division was reduced to 865 men. Meunier was wounded in the right arm during the battle. During the Battle of Laon on 9 March, Ney's corps fought all day over the hamlet of Semilly, capturing it and being driven out more than once. The attack on Semilly was continued on 10 March before Napoleon was finally convinced that he must retreat. At the Battle of Reims on 13 March 1814, Ney's corps consisted of the Young Guard divisions of Meunier and Curial and the 9th Division of Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier Boyer. At about this time, Napoleon reorganized the Young Guard into two divisions under Curial and Charpentier. At the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube on 20‚Äì21 March, Ney's corps consisted of the divisions of Boyer, Louis Friant, Christophe Henrion and Jan Willem Janssens; Meunier's division was no longer in the order of battle. The remnants of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Voltiguer Regiments were transferred to one of Curial's brigades. Later career During the Hundred Days, Meunier was placed in command of a Young Guard division, but he did not fight at the Battle of Waterloo. He was appointed inspector general of Brittany during the Bourbon Restoration and the subsequent July Monarchy. He wrote a popular history of Napoleon for his children. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur on 30 April 1835. Meunier died at Paris on 14 April 1846. He was buried beside his father-in-law Jacques-Louis David in the P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery, 56th division, 1st line. MEUNIER, C. is inscribed on the south pillar of the Arc de Triomphe.

The cannon sizes ranged from large to small depending on the location of their use. The household variety was used in estates to signal the time for the midday meal. Larger sizes were used in European parks to signal noon. The cannons were used by European royalty in the 18th century. Cannons of this type are exhibited at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The Hamilton Watch Company has a sundial cannon manufactured by Rousseau of Paris ca. 1650. The Rousseau cannon is mounted on a marble sundial and is made of brass. The Sultan of Morocco also owns one that was manufactured by Baker & Sons of London.  History  The earliest sundial cannons were used in Europe in the 1600s. They were also used in European parks during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The cannon-lens combination was mounted on a sundial. Sundial guns were also used in ships to mark noon. Miniaturized toy versions of the guns were sold in 1979 as unassembled kits by Dixie Gun Works.  Operation  A sundial cannon manufactured by Victor Chevalier of Paris ca. 1800. The linear ignition groove is in the same direction as the north-south axis of the sundial The gun and the linear ignition groove of the fuse were aligned on a north‚Äìsouth axis, parallel to the one of the sundial, while the lens concentrated the sun rays on the fuse when the sun was directly above. Subsequently, the burning fuse ignited the powder placed in the barrel of the cannon. The lens was mounted on an adjustable frame, which enabled its position to be changed depending on the season. During winter, in December for example, for the small brass cannon manufactured by Rousseau of Paris, the lens had to be lowered by four inches, compared to its position in June as the position of the sun in the sky is lower in winter than during the summer. In naval operations, the gun had to be mounted on a rotating base because its orientation had to be in the north‚Äìsouth direction. The directional axis of the gun was determined using the ship's compass. In such operation, the gun was frequently referred to as the \\"noonday gun\\" because it fired at noon. This practice became obsolete when the ship chronometer was invented. The use of the sundial cannon was subsequently confined to substandard ships. Benjamin Franklin Benjamin Franklin wrote the following review about the cannons in Poor Richard's Almanack: Popular Mechanics A farmer shown adjusting the lens position for a sundial cannon. From an article titled \\"Women 'Insurgents' in the Farming Business\\" in the July 1911 issue of Popular Mechanics. The original caption is: \\"Adjusting the Sundial which Sets Off the Cannon Automatically at Noon\\" In a section of the July 1911 issue of Popular Mechanics titled \\"Women 'Insurgents' in the Farming Business\\" the writer comments regarding the picture to the right:  In literature  A sundial gun is mentioned in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.

In 2017, the system was predicted to result in a merger in 2022.2 (¬± 0.6 years), producing a luminous red nova (LRN) reaching an apparent magnitude of 2. The LRN would remain visible to the naked eye for roughly a month. The merger of the two stellar cores was predicted to give birth to a new, hotter, more massive main- sequence star. However, a reanalysis of the data in September 2018 revealed that the prediction had been based on a wrongly-timed observation, negating the predicted merger. The period of the variations in KIC 9832227 has been observed to be growing shorter since 2013, leading to the prediction of the merger in 2022. In September 2018, it was announced that the original prediction was based on a timing offset of 12 hours in one of the datasets. This shows that the period had actually been increasing up to about 2008.

The Hoosiers compiled a 9‚Äì0‚Äì1 record, led the conference in both scoring offense (27.9 points per game) and scoring defense (5.6 points allowed per game), and finished the season ranked No. 4 in the final AP Poll. The lone blemish on the team's record was a 7-7 tie with Northwestern in the second game of the season. End Bob Ravensberg was a consensus first-team pick on the 1945 College Football All-America Team. Freshman halfback George Taliaferro rushed for 719 yards (the first African- American player to lead the Big Ten in rushing) and received second-team All- American honors. Michigan, under head coach Fritz Crisler, compiled a 7‚Äì3 record and was ranked No. 6 in the final AP Poll. Center Harold Watts won the team's most valuable player award.

Originally emptying into Spuyten Duyvil Creek as part of the Harlem River system, the stream is now partially subterranean, ending above ground at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake within Van Cortlandt Park. There it proceeds into city sewers, draining into either the northern end of the Harlem River or the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant. The brook provides significant watershed to both Van Cortlandt Park at its south end and Tibbetts Brook Park at its north end. There have been modern proposals to daylight the southern portion of the brook back onto the surface. Course Tibbetts Brook originates at H.F. Redmond Junior Memorial Park just north of Yonkers Avenue in Dunwoodie, Yonkers. It proceeds south through two artificial lakes in Tibbetts Brook Park, on a course parallel and adjacent to the Saw Mill River Parkway and the former New York and Putnam Railroad (now a park trail). South of the park the brook runs in a channel directly adjacent to the northbound side of the parkway, then crosses the Yonkers/Bronx border into Van Cortlandt Park. It runs through the center of the Van Cortlandt Golf Course, then empties into Van Cortlandt Lake, an artificial lake created in 1699 by damming the stream. The brook currently ends at the south edge of the lake, at approximately West 242nd Street. Several storm drains feed excess rainwater into the brook within Yonkers. At the brook's mouth, the water from the brook proceeds into a brick sewer tunnel, which later merges with the major combined sewer underneath Broadway that carries rainwater, household wastewater, and industrial sewage. The tunnel primarily drains into the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant where city sewage is treated. During rainy conditions the sewer overflows into the north end of the Harlem River, via a drain pipe at about West 192nd Street (Heath Avenue). Due to modern development, the brook runs through underpasses and culverts at various points along its course. As recently as the early 20th Century, Tibbets Brook had two northern tributaries which merged at the north end of modern Tibbets Brook Park. The easternmost began in Redmond Park, while the western stream extended as far as Runyon Heights. The two streams originally merged at Peckham's Lake, later converging at the lakes of Tibbets Brook Park following the completion of the park. The Saw Mill Parkway was built over the western stream in the late 1920s. Until the end of the 19th century, the brook extended past the south end of Van Cortlandt Park. It ran southwest through the site of the current Van Cortlandt Stadium, crossed Broadway at around West 240th Street, then continued southwest through the Kingsbridge neighborhood, running a twisty course along the right-of-way of modern Tibbett Avenue. At approximately West 230th Street, just north of the current site of John F. Kennedy High School, the brook drained into Spuyten Duyvil Creek, which at the time separated the Bronx from Marble Hill, Manhattan. Until the 1700s, Tibbets Brook split into two smaller streams at around West 237th Street, the westernmost and primary stream along modern Tibbett Avenue feeding into the Spuyten Duyvil, and the easternmost along the right-of-ways of the Putnam Railroad and current Major Deegan Expressway feeding into the Harlem River. The two streams formed a triangular island called Paparinemo that constitutes much of today's Kingsbridge neighborhood. The brook had numerous tributaries, including several within modern Van Cortlandt Park. The north end of the brook within Yonkers and the park is entirely fresh water, while south of the park it was a tidal estuary lined with salt marshes. The watershed from the brook created wetlands surrounding the stream, and formed a northern extension of the Harlem River valley. The original Spuyten Duyvil Creek course has since been filled in, replaced by the Harlem River Ship Canal. Etymology An 1867 map of Yonkers and Western Bronx, showing the course of Tibbetts Brook (in red) prior to modern development. Tibbetts Brook was originally referred to as Mosholu by local Lenape Native Americans, an Algonquin word meaning \\"smooth stones\\" or \\"small stones\\". The Mosholu name was later given to Mosholu Parkway. The label Tibbetts Brook was applied by European settlers, named after George Tippett who held property between the Hudson River and Bronx River in the late 17th Century, with the brook running through the center. Although often considered a corruption of the name Tippett, the label may be a combination of the name of Tippett and that of his father-in-law William Betts, who owned the land along with him. The brook has also been referred to as the Yonkers River or Yonkers Creek in the past, previously written as Jonckers or Uncas. History =Geological formation and precolonial use= The lake within Van Cortlandt Park, at the south end of the brook During at least three glacial periods, including the Wisconsin glaciation around 20,000 years ago, ice sheets advanced south across North America carving moraines, valleys, and hills across present-day Bronx and Westchester. As the glacial ice melted, rivers and creeks were formed within valleys, including Tibbetts Brook. Prior to European colonization, the local Lenape population utilized the brook for drinking water and fishing. Trout swam up the Harlem River in order to use the freshwater portion of the brook as a spawning site. The salt marshes along the stream housed fish and migratory birds, along with mussels, oysters, and crabs. =Human development= In the 1690s, Jacobus Van Cortlandt acquired property near Tibbetts Brook from his relative Frederick Philipse, located in modern Van Cortlandt Park. This area was called \\"George's Point\\", where the brook turned west towards Broadway. In 1699, Van Cortlandt dammed the stream in order to power a gristmill and sawmill, creating Van Cortlandt Lake as a mill pond in the process. By the 19th Century, the eastern stream was filled in, connecting Kingsbridge to the rest of the Bronx. From 1872 to 1880, the New York and Putnam Railroad was built along the Tibbetts Brook valley. The construction of the railroad altered the natural drainage pattern of the brook, leading new marshes to develop around it. In 1888, the New York City Parks Department acquired the land to create Van Cortlandt Park. The Parks Department began draining the brook wetlands for recreational areas, creating the park's parade ground in 1888 and the Van Cortlandt Golf Course in 1895. The lake flows south into a drain pipe to the Broadway sewer Between the late 1890s and the early 1910s, around the time the original course of Spuyten Duyvil Creek was filled in and replaced by the Harlem River Ship Canal, the double-arched Broadway sewer was constructed, as was the tunnel at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake to funnel water from the brook into the sewer. The marshlands created by the brook and lake had drawn the ire of local residents and property owners, who believed them to be \\"unsightly and unsanitary\\". Of particular concern was the threat of the wetlands serving as breeding grounds for malaria-borne mosquitoes. The Broadway Outlet Sewer was completed in 1907. In conjunction with the sewer project, from 1903 to 1911 the Parks Department completed a cleaning and improvement project for the Van Cortlandt Lake. This involved removing the original earthen dam and emptying the lake in order to dredge the lake bed to a lower depth. A new dam was installed to reform the lake. The drain pipe between the lake and Broadway sewer was constructed from 1911 to 1912. It was originally envisioned as cast-iron, but built using brick. Around this time, Tibbett Avenue was laid out and opened, while much of the marshland within the park and along the former river course was filled in. On June 25, 1927, Westchester County opened Tibbetts Brook Park near the northern end of the brook, on land previously confiscated from the Tippett estate. Much of the site had been a Yonkers city garbage dump located on the banks of the western brook tributary. The garbage and residential sewage seeped into the stream, which fed polluted water into Peckham's Lake. The lake had been used by residents as a swimming hole in spite of recommendations against it by health officials. The area immediately south of the lake had been a swamp which was a haven for mosquitoes. As part of the creation of the park, the original lake was filled in, while the swamp was dredged to form the current Tibbetts Lake. The brook, meanwhile, was diverted into a paved channel. The eastern tributary had been protected by fences and infrastructure from the nearby Old Croton Aqueduct. At the time the park was constructed, the southern portion of the Saw Mill River Parkway was built on top of the dump along the western tributary course. Between the 1930s and 1960s under the supervision of Robert Moses, several highways including the Henry Hudson, Saw Mill and Mosholu Parkways were constructed within Van Cortlandt Park, requiring Tibbetts Brook to be diverted into culverts under the roadways. The creation of the sewer at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake and the construction of the highways induced siltation of the stream, leading to further creation of marshes. In addition, pollution from upstream and the highways, and spillover of chemicals used in the golf course led to the death of fish inhabiting the lake. In 1978, the fish population of the lake was restored. In 1979, four storm sewers along Midland Avenue in Yonkers (which forms the eastern boundary of Tibbetts Brook Park) were found to be illegally connected to the brook, pumping raw sewage into it which proceeded to enter Van Cortlandt Lake downstream. That year, another storm drain located at approximately Lawton Street and McLean Avenue near the Saw Mill Parkway, north of the Yonkers/Bronx border, was found to be leaking household sewage into the brook. In 1984, sewage from Yonkers was again found to be contaminating Van Cortlandt Lake, due to the crossing of raw sewage pipes and storm sewers which feed into Tibbetts Brook. This included water from the Lawton Street drain pipe. The same sewage pipe was found to be the cause of pollution of the lake in 2016. Beginning in 2015, the Friends of Van Cortlandt Park, in collaboration with the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Manhattan College, monitor the Brook's water quality. =Daylighting= Putnam Railroad still in operation In the 21st century, it has been proposed to daylight the southern portion of Tibbetts Brook back onto the surface, and to restore and defragment the portions of the stream within Van Cortlandt Park. Proposals to daylight the stream have existed since the 1990s. Around of fresh water from the brook enter the sewer system on a daily basis, a total of annually. The additional water from the brook also contributes to the further overflowing of raw sewage into the Harlem River during rainy conditions. Meanwhile, the lack of natural drainage points within Van Cortlandt Park leads to the flooding of recreational areas within the park. The New York City Parks Department plans to daylight the brook as part of their \\"Van Cortlandt Park Master Plan: 2030\\". The plan also proposes further dredging the lake and stream within the park, and rerouting the stream away from the highways and pedestrian paths to minimize the use of culverts, as well as restoring the natural wetlands created by the brook. The primary route proposed for bringing the brook above ground is the former Putnam Railroad right-of-way, which is currently owned by CSX Transportation but is largely abandoned between the park and the Harlem River. This portion of the Putnam Railroad is directly adjacent to the southbound lanes of the Major Deegan Expressway. The routing would provide a more natural drainage path for the brook into the Harlem River, with none of the water entering the sewer system on a normal basis. The brook would flow through a new park.

He is currently emeritus professor of strategic studies at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre which is part of the Australian National University. He was the head of the National Assessments Staff (the predecessor to the Office of National Assessments) from 1974 to 1978, the director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation (the predecessor to the Defence Intelligence Organisation) from 1986 to 1988, and the head of the Defence Strategy and Intelligence Group with the rank of Deputy Secretary in the Department of Defence from 1988 to 1991. Dibb is also known for his contribution to Australian defence strategy through writing the 1986 Review of Australia‚Äôs defence capabilities, known as the Dibb Report, and being the primary author of the 1987 Defence White Paper. From 1965 to 1984, Dibb worked for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, tasked with gaining intelligence and recruiting KGB and GRU agents in Canberra.The Australian ASIO suspected defence expert was KGB double agent  Early life and education  Dibb was born on 3 October 1939 in Fryston, a coal mining village in Castleford, West Yorkshire, England to mother Ethel, maid to a local solicitor, and father Cyril, a trolley-bus driver. He attended the King's School in Pontefract. He was awarded a County Exhibition Scholarship to undertake a Bachelor of Arts in economics and geography at the University of Nottingham. He graduated with honours in 1960. After graduation, Dibb worked as an apprentice manager at a chrome component factory for motor vehicles. Against the advice of the Careers and Appointments Board of Nottingham University, he applied to the British Civil Service. His advisers had warned that he was unlikely to succeed because he did not attend a prestigious school like Eton or Harrow, and Cambridge or Oxford. He was rejected likely due to classist attitudes about his working-class background. He applied to join the Australian Public Service and was offered a job as a research officer on the UK desk of the then Australian Department of Trade. He moved to Canberra in 1961. In 1965, Dibb joined the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to research the Soviet wheat industry economy. Dibb then briefly worked on independence negotiations for Nauru as the personal assistant to the Secretary of the Department of Territories in 1967. In 1968, he joined the Australian National University Research School of Social Sciences working as a research fellow in Soviet affairs until joining the Joint Intelligence Organisation in 1970. In 1986, Dibb received his Doctorate of Philosophy from the Australian National University with the thesis The Soviet Union: The Incomplete Superpower, which examined Soviet power and critiqued the mainstream opinion that the Soviet Union was a superpower. Dibb's thesis was critically acclaimed.  Intelligence career  Dibb joined the Australian Intelligence Community in 1970 as an analyst in the Directorate of Economic Intelligence of the Joint Intelligence Organisation. He moved to the National Assessments Staff (the predecessor to the Office of National Assessments) supporting the then National Intelligence Committee (the predecessor to the National Intelligence Coordination Committee) in 1972 and became director- general of the National Assessments Staff in 1974 serving until 1978. He served as a deputy director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation from 1978 to 1980. In 1980 he was appointed the Senior Assistant Secretary of Strategic Policy within the Department of Defence. In 1986, Dibb was given charge of the Joint Intelligence Organisation (the predecessor to the Defence Intelligence Organisation) and served until 1988. From 1988 to 1991, he served as the Deputy Secretary for Strategy and Intelligence with responsibilities for the Joint Intelligence Organisation and its transformation into the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the then Defence Signals Directorate and Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation. In 1991, Dibb was honoured by the United States National Reconnaissance Office for his work in US‚ÄìAustralian space collaboration, relating to his work overseeing the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap and supporting the National Reconnaissance Office‚ÄìCentral Intelligence Agency Program B. Dibb was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1989 for his contribution to defence policy, strategy and intelligence.  ASIO agent  In parallel with his academic and public service careers, Dibb worked for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) to gather counterintelligence on the Soviet Union capabilities in Australia for over 20 years from 1965 to 1984. In 1965, Dibb was recruited by the deputy director-general of the ASIO, Ron Richards, who had run the Petrov defection in 1954. Dibb was charged with developing relationships with Soviet diplomats in Canberra, gathering intelligence about KGB and GRU capabilities in Australia, and investigating Soviet views on the Australian-United States alliance and the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap. Dibb also sounded out the potential of Soviet agents to defect to the West or to work as informants to the Australian Intelligence Community. Confidential documents show that in 1977, the Central Intelligence Agency believed Dibb was a more valuable informant for the CIA on the Soviets in Canberra than was ASIO itself. However, ASIO grew suspicious of Dibb because of his White Russian wife and closeness with his contacts in the Soviet Embassy, including the Canberra KGB Station Chief Lev Koshlyakov who had taken Dibb and Dibb's wife dancing in Moscow in 1984. An ASIO briefing note marked \\"secret\\" written in October 1984 by ASIO Director-General Harvey Barnett about Dibb and released under FOI confirms that ASIO investigated Dibb on security grounds. Nonetheless Dibb was cleared and exonerated and he continued his intelligence career in the Department of Defence.  Dibb Report  From 1985 to 1986, Dibb was a ministerial consultant to Defence Minister Kim Beazley, a member of the Hawke Government. During this time, he formulated a review of Australia's defence capabilities known as the Dibb Report. According to journalist Geoffrey Barker, it was \\"his most important public and personal contribution to defence policy.\\"  Academic career  In 1981, Dibb briefly left the Australian Public Service to work as a senior research fellow in the Department of International Relations at the Australian National University and then became an administrator of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in 1984 until joining the Minister for Defence as a ministerial consultant in 1985. In 1991, Dibb retired from the Australian Public Service and became the director of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, part of the Australian National University until 2003‚Äìwhere he is currently the emeritus professor. During the Government of Prime Minister John Howard, Dibb was a member of the Foreign Minister's Foreign Policy Advisory Council.  Personal life  Dibb is married to Rhondda Nicholas, his third wife. He has a daughter and a son.

They are the representative Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) team of the British Army regiment, the Irish Guards and the first British army club in Gaelic football after the lifting of a ban on members of the British military playing Gaelic games. They are affiliated to the London GAA and were founded in 2015.  Background  Prior to 2001, the Gaelic Athletic Association had rule 21 in their official rulebook which prohibited members of the British armed forces from being members of the association or playing Gaelic games. In 2001, the GAA voted in favour of removing rule 21 despite five of the six county boards of Northern Ireland voting against it. The removal of the rule meant that British security and police forces were now able to join the GAA. The Police Service of Northern Ireland, following their reconstitution from the Royal Ulster Constabulary, formed PSNI GAA as the first team for British security services who had previously been prohibited from playing.  History  In 2015, the Irish Guards moved their barracks from Aldershot, Hampshire to Hounslow in London. During a tour of Afghanistan, members of the Irish Guards brought GAA jerseys and hurls with them and a suggestion was made about them having their own team. Following their tour, they applied to the London GAA for membership to be able to play in the London Junior Football Championships. They also wanted to join so that Fijian born soldiers could play \\"a strong physical game that would suit them\\". However membership would not be restricted to serving soldiers and would be an open club. The case for the Irish Guards GAA was made by County Waterford-born Major Ken Fox in a presentation to the London GAA. When the London GAA voted on permitting the Irish Guards to join the county board, there was a split vote 15‚Äì15. The London GAA chairman Noel O'Sullivan used his casting vote to permit the Irish Guards membership. He justified his support for the Irish Guards, stating \\"I just chose what I believe leads to the betterment of London and to the GAA in general.\\" Following their affiliation, members of the Irish Guards GAA team attended Setanta GFC's kit launch as well as to support their bid for affiliation with a British county board after London GAA had rejected them on proximity grounds. In January 2016, Granuaile GAA moved a motion at the next London GAA meeting to expel the Irish Guards GAA from the county board. However, the Central Board of the GAA intervened to veto the motion stating that there were no grounds by which a motion in support of a club's affiliation could be rescinded. The Irish Guards GAA was founded in 2015 and played their first match against T√≠r Chonaill Gaels in March 2016, fielding players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

The battle was a major Aghlabid victory. It is sometimes known as the Second Battle of Milazzo, counting the Battle of Stelai as the First Battle of Milazzo. Battle In 888, the Aghlabids mounted a new expedition aimed at Byzantine Calabria, with ships from Sicily as well as Ifriqiya. Off Milazzo, the fleet met a Byzantine squadron of the Imperial Fleet of Constantinople. The ensuing battle is not mentioned by any Byzantine source, but only by Ibn Idhari's al-Bayan al- Mughrib as well as the Cambridge Chronicle. Both agree that it was a crushing Aghlabid victory‚Äîtheir first in open sea combat: reportedly 5,000 Byzantines drowned, and 7,000 in total (or 7,000 more, depending on the translation from the Arabic) were killed. Aftermath In the aftermath of this debacle, the Byzantines abandoned many strongholds they had held in the Val Demone, and the remainder, left without hope of Byzantine aid, concluded a truce with the Aghlabid governor of Sicily. Even the garrison and populace of Rhegion are said to have temporarily abandoned their city for fear of Aghlabid attacks.

Jointly funded by S. Prasanna and S. Shashikala Balaji, the film is produced under Skkandda Entertainment banner. It features Sathish Ninasam and Shruthi Hariharan, teaming up again after Lucia (2013), in the lead roles. The film score and soundtrack is composed by Bharath B. J.. The film was officially launched on 14 February 2015 coinciding the Valentines Day and was released across Karnataka on 20 January 2017.  Plot  The movie follows the lives of Prashanth (Sathish Ninasam), an idler with well-to-do parents, and Nandini (Sruthi Hariharan) who is the sole breadwinner of her family of four. Prashanth falls in love with Nandini, who agrees to marry him only on the condition that he gives up his carefree ways and behaves responsibly. The couple's honeyed existence is abruptly cut short when police Inspector Kodanda (Achyuth Kumar) stages a raid on the beauty parlor Nandini was working at, proclaiming that sex-trade activities were being carried out there, and displays condom packets which were apparently found there as proof of the illegal activities being carried out there. Video clips of Nandini and her friend Ratna are circulated continuously on TV, leading to Ratna attempting suicide due to the immense emotional trauma. Prashanth is shell-shocked by the news and breaks up with Nandini without giving her a chance to explain herself. It emerges later that the raid on the parlor was a fake, and was done so by the Inspector in order to take revenge against the parlor owner who had refused to give bribes to him. When clips of the Inspector planting condom packets surface on TV, Prashanth realizes his mistake and attempts to reconcile with Nandini, who refuses to have anything more to do with him and tearfully berates him for trusting the media rather than the words of his fiance√©. In order to win back Nandini's respect, Prashanth goes on a crusade against Inspector Kodanda, kidnapping his daughter Rachana. He demands that Kodanda publicly confess to his crime of demanding bribes, which led him to plot the parlor owner's downfall. Kodanda appears before the media and admits his wrongdoings, and apologizes to Nandini and Ratna for having destroyed their lives and careers for furthering his own greedy interests. In the midst of the conference, Rachana is freed by Prashanth, and calls up her father, who rushes to the spot. Rachana is disgusted by the behaviour of her father, and refuses to talk to him anymore, and leaves after informing him that he as a father provided her with everything in the world, but failed to provide the one thing that mattered: a good example of honesty and truthfulness. Prashanth and Nandini reconcile, and their story is featured on the TV show Beautiful Manasugalu as the credits roll.

With the establishment of Soviet Armenia in 1920, the production of Armenian brandy was nationalized and the brandy was popularized as \\"Shustov\\" until 1940, when the drink was labeled as \\"Ararat\\", after the re-organization of Armenian brandy production.

The building of the factory was built on the site of this palace The Yerevan Ararat Brandy Factory was founded by the Armenian merchant and philanthropist Nerses Tairyan in 1877, within the territory of the former Erivan Fortress. First, he started his industry with wine production. Soon after, he started to produce Armenian brandy as well. In 1899‚Äì1900, the factory was acquired by the Russian businessman and wine-maker Nikolay Shustov. In 1920, Armenia became part of the Soviet Union and the economy was entirely nationalized.

However, in 1948, the brandy production in Soviet Armenia was re-organized, with two separate entities: the Yerevan Ararat Brandy Factory (founded in 1877 and current producer of NOY brandy), and the Yerevan Brandy Company (founded in 1887 and current producer of ArArAt brandy). After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the factory entered a period of abandonment until 2002, when it was privatized and sold to Multi Group Holding led by businessman Gagik Tsarukyan. Around US$ 50 million was invested into restoration and constructions, acquisition of new bottling line and oak barrels. The production of Armenian brandy was relaunched by the factory and the drink was labeled as \\"NOY\\", after Noah whose Ark has rested on the Mountains of Ararat, according to the biblical scriptures of the Book of Genesis.

It aims to allow developers to rapidly develop web applications using only front-end code by providing a backend based on Node.js and Apache CouchDB. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as on Microsoft Windows. Hoodie is produced by the Hoodie Open Source Project, founded by Jan Lehnardt and Gregor Martynus in 2011 and first released in 2013. It is written in JavaScript and released as free software under the Apache License 2.0  Overview  Hoodie is designed to abstract away the configuration and communication between the database backend and allow web-based front end development using simple calls to the Hoodie API. Hoodie uses CouchDB to store data for the application. If the application is offline and cannot access the CouchDB database, data is stored locally on the device in the offline PouchDB database. The data will later be synced to CouchDB when the connection to the server is re-established, using CouchDB's database synchronisation feature. Hoodie depends on Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm) to allow it to be used from the command line and to provide other tools for Hoodie projects. When Hoodie and its dependencies are installed, a skeleton project directory and basic files to start an application including index.html and main.js are created. Hoodie can also be used with large web application frameworks including Backbone.js, Ember.js, and AngularJS. The core Hoodie package is targeted at creating personal applications and saving user data to personal storage areas. For instance, for to-do lists, memos or favourite book lists. A set of basic commands is provided to achieve these functions, which includes user signup, login, store, and more. Hoodie extensions provide functions beyond the core backend commands. Extensions can be written by anyone and use the npm package system. For instance, an extension to store data globally and allow multiple users to share and collaborate on the same data can be installed.  Architecture  Diagram showing how the interaction between the backend and frontend works The core structure of Hoodie is to provide a JavaScript package that provides API calls to store data on CouchDB or offline on PouchDB. The user does not need to understand how the online/offline synchronisation works. The backend is dealt with by simple commands to store and retrieve data. Example of the store function: hoodie.store.add(type, object); The hoodie.store.add function adds an object to a personal database store. The type parameter is where the object will be stored in CouchDB. CounchDB is a noSQL database and as such does not have tables but the 'type' identifier is similar to adding to a particular table in a database. This allows data/documents of a similar type to be stored, queried or retrieved using the same type identifier. Full example of store function: $('#todoinput').on('keypress', function(event) { if (event.keyCode = 13 && event.target.value.length) { hoodie.store.add('todo', {title: event.target.value}); event.target.value = ; } }); The example above shows how a todo item could be added to the Hoodie store. The item is added as with a type of 'todo' and the data sent is the simply a title value.  Community  Hoodie is open source and encourages community involvement. It is one of the first open source projects to establish a code of conduct from the outset. Hoodie community aims to involve both coders and non-coders in helping the project. As the Hoodie package is aimed at beginners and users unfamiliar with full stack software development, the community encourages all levels of technical and non-technical users to get involved.  Characteristics  * Designed for offline first, no-backend, NoSQL web development. * Hoodie is open source and encourages community involvement. * Further extensions to core functionality are encouraged. * Designed using an approach of writing simple, idealised 'dreamcode' and then finding a way to implement this into working code.  Platforms and users  Built to be cross-platform, Hoodie works on all major Linux distributions, as well as on other Unix-like systems Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows support. Hoodie is used commercially by the Appback hosting site which uses hoodie to provide a Back end as a Service (BaaS), minutes.io web application and Neighbourhoodie development house. A showcase of applications using Hoodie is provided on the Hoodie website.

Teams are sorted by the overall percentage of points accumulated out of points available (two times the number of games played) throughout NHL history. In the NHL's points system, a team is awarded 2 points for a win (regardless if earned in regulation, overtime or shootout), 1 point for a tie, 1 point for an overtime loss, and 0 points for a loss. The overtime loss statistic (abbreviated as OT or OTL) was introduced into the NHL's points system in the 1999‚Äì2000 season. A commonly used term for the point awarded to a team for an overtime loss is a loser point. As a result of the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, which canceled the entire 2004‚Äì05 season, the league adopted a shootout to determine the winner of a game which is still tied after an overtime period. This feature, introduced in the 2005‚Äì06 season, eliminated ties from the game.

These instructions amended the extensive set of rules and procedures issued on 22 February 1996 by his predecessor John Paul II in his apostolic constitution Universi Dominici gregis. Benedict reversed or modified some innovations John Paul had instituted that dealt with procedures to be followed if a papal conclave lasted more than two weeks. He also modified the cardinals' authority to set the start date of a conclave and tightened the punishment for support personnel who violate their oath of secrecy. Instructions =De aliquis mutationibus in normis de electione Romani Pontificis= John Paul's 1996 rules had introduced some \\"radical\\" innovations that allowed the cardinal electors, after 33 ballots (not counting any ballot taken on the first day of the conclave), to determine by majority vote how to proceed, allowing them to lower the majority needed for election from two-thirds of those voting to as little as a simple majority, and allowing them to restrict the balloting to the candidates who had received the most votes in the preceding ballot. John Paul had then received \\"more than a few requests\\" ('), according to Benedict, to restore the traditional requirement of a two-thirds majority. The two- thirds majority requirement had been established by the Third Lateran Council in 1179. Since participants in a conclave are bound by an oath of secrecy, the impact of these changes on the one conclave where they controlled is unknowable. Observers imagine two opposite effects. During the papal election in 2005, once the votes for Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger exceeded a simple majority, his supporters knew they could continue voting for him until they were able to institute the simple majority rule that John Paul allowed. On the other hand, it is questionable whether Ratzinger would have accepted election on such terms, as the first pope in centuries with the support of a bare majority of the electors. Benedict issued De aliquis mutationibus in normis de electione Romani Pontificis on 11 June 2007 after two years as pope. In this five-paragraph document, Benedict denied the cardinal electors the options John Paul had allowed them and retained only John Paul's determination that a change was required after many ballots had failed to produce a result. He restored the two-thirds majority rule. He established the procedure that after 33 ballots (still excluding the first day's ballot if any), additional ballots would allow voting only for the two candidates with the greatest number of votes in the preceding ballot, and he excluded those two candidates from participation in the balloting. =Normas nonnullas= Benedict resigned the papacy on 11 February 2013, effective 28 February. On 22 February he issued his second set of instructions on the papal election process, Normas nonnullas. Following his resignation, cardinals had questioned the rule that they delay starting the conclave until 15 days after the papacy fell vacant. Benedict allowed them to begin earlier \\"if all the Cardinal electors are present\\" and to delay the start until 20 days pass \\"for serious reasons\\". He modified the oath of secrecy to be taken by all support personnel, making excommunication the automatic punishment (') for violations of the oath, which had previously been punished at the discretion of the new pope. The cardinals began meeting in General Congregation, including both cardinal electors and those too old to participate in the balloting, on 4 March. The last of the cardinal electors arrived on 7 March, Cardinal Jean-Baptiste Ph·∫°m Minh M·∫´n of Vietnam. They took advantage of Benedict's modification of the rules and voted on 8 March to begin the conclave on 12 March.

The building is listed as a protected monument in the Bavarian protected monuments list.  Description  The town hall is located in Gro√ühadern in the Munich's district 20 of Hadern, at W√ºrmtalstra√üe 126 in the north-west corner of the crossing of W√ºrmtalstra√üe and Gro√ühaderner Stra√üe. It was built in 1930‚Äî31 according to the plans of Ludwig Zwingmann. This construction was meant to combine practicality and traditional building. The building served a twofold purpose from the beginning: the municipal chancery of Gro√ühadern occupied only the ground floor, and in the upper floors were apartments. The three-story building with a rectangular floor plan is about 35 meters long and about 12 meters wide and has a hipped roof. The fa√ßade looks more like an apartment house than a town hall. The official character of the building is emphasized by a bay tower carrying a spherical tower helmet with a weather vane. The ground floor of the narrow side is dominated by the two great gates of the Departement Gro√ühadern of the volunteer fire department Munich (Munich Fire Department). A stone figure was placed between the two rows of windows on the upper floor.

Outside of Overwatch, Hanzo also appears in related media, which includes animated shorts and webcomics, as well as a playable character in the crossover multiplayer online battle arena game Heroes of the Storm. The character is Japanese and the eldest brother of fellow playable character, Genji. The two brothers belonged to the Shimada clan, a fictional Japanese crime family. In his backstory, Hanzo was forced by the clan's elders to kill Genji. The dutiful but heartbroken Hanzo subsequently denounced his family and fled Japan to travel the world, seeking redemption from the actions of his past. In-game, he is classified as a damage character with a high difficulty ranking. He is an archer whose abilities include firing rapid bursts of arrows to engage high priority targets and jumping forward, as well as revealing the location of enemy players. Hanzo has been well received by critics and fans alike, with praise being directed towards his character arc involving his brother, design, and abilities. However, reviewers have also noted the character requires practice in order to be used effectively in the game. Development and design alt=Image shows three characters. Genji, a cyborg-ninja is standing in the middle, while Hanzo, an archer, is standing next to him on the right. The first character on the left is the original concept of Hanzo, who was split into the two brothers. Originally, Hanzo and his brother Genji were created as a single cyborg-ninja character named Hanzo, who wielded both a bow and sword. Due to feeling that the character was too unfocused in design and had too many ninja elements attached to him, it was decided that the character would be split into two brothers, with Hanzo obtaining the bow, name and clothing of the original character. He was one of 12 Overwatch characters revealed at BlizzCon 2014. He was described as being lightly-armored, scampering up walls using his bare hands and being able to spot enemies through obstacles. Hanzo was named after Hattori Hanz≈ç, one of the most famous samurai. Hattori was also known as \\"Demon Hanzo\\" because of his tactician abilities, which is what inspired Hanzo's \\"Demon\\" skin during the \\"Overwatch Halloween Terror\\" seasonal event in October. Hanzo and Genji's story arc was inspired by the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi. Michael Chu, lead writer of Overwatch, described Hanzo's storyline as \\"will-he, won't-he fall to darkness\\", and stated that Hanzo is \\"real interesting because he can be a hero and a villain depending on your point of view ‚Äì I think he can be both at the same time. There are more things to investigate there.\\" In the English version of the game, Hanzo is voiced by Paul Nakauchi. When Overwatch was first released, Hanzo had two normal abilities, the \\"Sonic Arrow\\" that would briefly highlight any enemies in range of where it landed for all his allies, and the \\"Scatter Arrow\\" that would split into five separate arrows that would ricochet off walls from the point of impact. The Scatter Arrow was found by Blizzard and players to often be too powerful, able to take out tank characters with normally high damage in a single shot. This also made Hanzo effectively play as a second sniper character alongside Widowmaker, and made him a difficult character to integrate into cooperative play. As early as November 2017, Jeff Kaplan and the Overwatch team discussed looking at vamping Hanzo's kit to deal with this problem. After a period of testing on the Public Test Region from April 20, 2018, the new kit was introduced on May 3, 2018. This kit replaced the \\"Scatter Arrow\\" with \\"Storm Arrows\\", the ability to fire six full-powered shots in rapid succession, along with a mid-air dash move. Along with other buffs and debuffs to other attack skills, these changes were designed to bring Hanzo to be more a front-line character. Gameplay Hanzo is classified as a damage character in Overwatch. He is a sniper and wields the \\"Storm Bow\\". His bow has an infinite number of arrows that can be fired in succession of one another. Alternatively, the arrows can be charged up for one second for a higher damage output and higher arrow velocity. Hanzo has two attacks relating to his bow. The first is \\"Sonic Arrow\\", which allows him and his teammates to see the location of their enemies that pass within a sphere of influence from the point of impact, and the second being \\"Storm Arrow\\", in which Hanzo can fire five arrows at full power in rapid succession. Hanzo also has the ability to \\"Lunge\\", dashing forward if he is in mid-air. Hanzo's ultimate ability is \\"Dragonstrike\\"; when using this ability, Hanzo fires a single arrow that releases two dragons that travel in a straight line, passing through all walls, until the end of the map. Any enemy caught in the line of fire and touching the dragons takes continuous direct damage, which can kill most unprotected characters within seconds. Hanzo also has a passive ability called \\"Wall Climb\\" that allows him to scale walls. Appearances =Overwatch= According to the character's fictional biography, Hanzo Shimada is 38, and was formerly based in the fictional Japanese town Hanamura. Hanzo belongs to the Shimada family, a clan of assassins. As the eldest son in the family, Hanzo was bound by duty to inherit the Shimada empire from his father, Sojiro Shimada. From an early age, he was trained for that responsibility and showed skill in martial arts, bowmanship and swordplay. Upon his father's death, the clan elders instructed Hanzo to straighten out his younger brother Genji who was following a carefree, playboy lifestyle. When Genji refused, the clan elders forced Hanzo to kill him. Though, unbeknown to him, Genji was saved by Overwatch doctor Angela Ziegler. The act of killing his brother broke Hanzo's heart and drove him to abandon the clan. The lore states that Hanzo currently travels the world, \\"attempting to restore his honor and put the ghosts of his past to rest.\\" =Heroes of the Storm= Hanzo was added to the Blizzard's crossover multiplayer online battle arena game Heroes of the Storm in December 2017, as part of the \\"Dragons of the Nexus\\" event. Hanzo's kit in the game is similar to his Overwatch abilities, including the charged, scatter, and sonic shot, wall-climb, and Dragonstrike. =Other appearances= Hanzo, as he appears in \\"Tracer: Reflections\\", the tenth issue in the tie-in, digital comic series. Art by Miki Montll√≥. Animations In May 2016, Hanzo made his first appearance in Dragons, the third in a series of animated shorts. In the short, Hanzo returns to the Shimada castle in Hanamura to honor his brother Genji on the anniversary of their fight and the resulting latter's apparent death. Despite numerous guards being present, he is able to easily overpower them before they can alert anyone else. While making offerings at his brother's shrine, a man appears from out of the shadows, whom Hanzo presumes was sent to kill him. The two fight evenly matched until Hanzo, out of arrows, attempts to use Dragonstrike to defeat his opponent. To his surprise, the assassin is also able to use the Shimada dragons and turns them against him. Defeated, Hanzo coldly accepts his death. The assassin spares Hanzo and reveals himself to be Genji, alive after all these years. The cybernetic ninja tells Hanzo that he has forgiven him for having attempted to kill him. When Genji attempts to leave, Hanzo draws out his bow, labelling him a fool and stating that \\"real life is not like the stories [their] father told [them]\\". Despite this, Genji said that he still believed in his brother and had hope for him before leaving. With Genji gone, Hanzo returned to finish his offering. Literature Hanzo made his first appearance in the digital comic \\"Tracer: Reflection\\", which was released in December 2016. In the comic, which is set during Christmas, Hanzo is depicted with a different style than his appearance in the game. This includes him wearing an earring and a nose piercing, in addition to having his hair in an undercut style. In the comic, he's shown staring at a strawberry cake inside a shop with a little boy behind him. Reception Shortly after the game came out, Hanzo was described as a \\"fan favorite\\" by Matt Kim of Inverse and \\"one of the more colorful characters\\" of the cast in the game by Motherboards Emmanuel Maiberg. In Twinfinite's competition for \\"Gaming's Best 2017 Archer\\", Hanzo won in two out of four categories; \\"Arrow Variety\\" and \\"Fashion Style\\". Justing Chang stated that \\"he may take a lot of time to learn, but once you do, it pays off, and you‚Äôll be one of the best snipers in your team while you play Overwatch.\\" The character has received a positive critical reception. VG247 referred to him as \\"the closest to a stealth ninja character\\" in Overwatch, noting that his abilities make him useful for finding and scattering opponents. Matt Whittaker of Hardcore Gamer wrote that Hanzo is \\"a sniper whose arrows do massive damage upon contact [and] is the type of hero that needs a bit of practice time before one feels totally comfortable\\", believing that player who practice with him will be able easily defeat their opponents. His Dragonstrike ability has also been well received for being able to kill the opposing team in seconds under the right circumstances. Within the gaming community, players that frequently select Hanzo as their character are often derogatorily called \\"Hanzo mains\\", as other players typically feel the \\"Hanzo mains\\" are not sufficiently skilled with the character to contribute to the team's effort. Such \\"Hanzo mains\\" are frequently ridiculed or told to switch to other characters. Some have even have been reported for abusive behavior through Blizzard's system for selecting Hanzo. Kotaku spoke to several players who frequently play Hanzo; these players felt that Hanzo was one of the more well- balanced characters once one becomes skilled at playing him. Additionally, they stated that the hate towards Hanzo is more likely from other players feeling a Hanzo player makes for a good scapegoat when the team is otherwise not cohesive. The term \\"Hanzo main\\" has been used outside of the Overwatch context as well. During the 2016 US presidential election, Nuisance Committee‚Äìmade by the creators of Cards Against Humanity‚Äìcreated a billboard depicting Donald Trump playing Overwatch that read \\"Donald Trump mains Hanzo and complains about team comp in chat\\". The term became further popularized by a viral tweet in March 2017, when a schoolgirl was reprimanded by her school for calling a classmate a \\"Hanzo main\\" for stealing her pencil. Mateus Mognon created the Hanzo National Church in Brazil in 2017 to honor the character. Mognon stated that he created the church as a form of protest art in order to show how ludicrous the Brazilian legislative system is. Additionally, the reason he chose Hanzo instead of L√∫cio or Mercy‚Äîcharacters associated with healing in-game‚Äîis due to the character's resemblance to Jesus. In May 2017, the social networking website Tumblr sifted through its data in order to determine which character pairings in Overwatch were the most popular. The data revealed that Hanzo and McCree (McHanzo) were the most popular pairing and that in all \\"shipping\\" related posts, they were shipped 35% of the time. A McHanzo related fan fic story titled \\"Hang the Fool\\", published on Archive of Our Own, was noted by Kotaku for being long-running. First starting in June 2016, the fanfic had garnered more than 300,000 hits by the end of 2017, even getting a fanzine based on it published. \\"Hang the Fool\\" was recognized by Syfy's Kristina Manete in 2020, and Manete noted another McHanzo fic titled \\"The Chain\\" for being a \\"wonderful study of McCree and Hanzo's personalities and pasts culminates in a spectacular fic for fans of the pair\\". While McHanzo is not canonized within Overwatch and Blizzard has not confirmed it, people involved with the game and company have acknowledged it. McCree's voice actor Matthew Mercer has described the pairing as \\"adorable\\", noting that the characters' contrasting personalities makes the ship interesting. Director and lead designer of Overwatch, Jeff Kaplan, when asked by a fan at BlizzCon 2017, stated that McHanzo is one of his two favorite ships from the game; the other being Pharah and Mercy.

Founded in 2016, the EEBA is a partnership between the Belgian private school \\"Lyc√©e Moli√®re\\", and the Scandinavian School of Brussels (SSB). The EEBA, through its partnership with the SSB, offers its students the International Baccalaureate as its secondary leaving qualification, with plans to also offer the European Baccalaureate in the near future. The school caters to nursery, primary and secondary students and is equipped with facilities for boarders aged 15 and up.  History  = European Schools = Since 1958, Brussels has played host to a growing number of institutions and bodies of the European Communities (EC) - now European Union (EU). In 1958, the European School, Brussels I (ESB1) opened its doors with the primary purpose of providing an education to the children of the staff of said institutions. The ESB1, was to be unusual in that it was to be the second in a network of schools directly governed and financed through a new separate intergovernmental organisation, originally established by the 1957 Statue of the European School - since repealed and replaced by the 1994 Convention Defining the Statute of the European Schools. The Board of Governors of the school network was to be composed of education ministers of the signatory states. The European Schools committed themselves to a multilingual and multicultural pedagogical approach, leading to the European Baccalaureate - a bilingual secondary leaving qualification overseen by the Board of Governors. = High demand = As member states each acceded to the EC - and, later, the EU - they would successively sign up to the treaties governing the European Schools in order to guarantee an education to the children of staff of their respective nationalities. Simultaneously increased European institutional presence and staff numbers in Brussels put a strain on the European Schools in the city. Between the founding of the ESB1 and 2007, three more European Schools were founded in Brussels. In 2015, the European Schools authorised a fifth school. In the years since the European Schools' founding, its curriculum, ethos, and qualification had become popular amongst families of staff of other international institutions and corporations in Brussels, as well as locals. However, with the European Schools legally obligated to provide an education to the children of EU staff first, there was often little availability of school places. = Belgium's first Accredited European School = In 2013, seeking a solution to the high demand for European School places in Brussels, the Board of Governors of the European Schools requested the Belgian state permit the creation of the Belgium's first \\"Accredited European School\\". Taking advantage of regulations agreed by the Board of Governors in 2005, such a school would be accredited to provide the European Schools' curriculum, and the European Baccalaureate, whilst being under national jurisdiction and independently financed. It would join a network of thirteen existing such Accredited European Schools across the EU. Responding to the Belgian government's calls, the Belgian private school, \\"Lyc√©e Moli√®re\\", and the Scandinavian School of Brussels, proposed a partnership venture for the creation of an Accredited European School. In September 2016, the English- language primary school section of the European School of Bruxelles-Argenteuil opened its doors on the grounds of the Ch√¢teau d'Argenteuil, in Waterloo, 15 km south of Brussels. From September 2017, the EEBA was able to provide education to secondary level education for students whose mother-tongue was English, French, or Swedish.  Accreditation  The Board of Governors of the European Schools signed an accreditation agreement with the EEBA on 13 March 2018, valid until 31 August 2021, when upon it will require renewal. In concordance with the rigorous accreditation process, accredited schools are routinely audited by the Boards of Inspectors of the European Schools, with the EEBA's last audit taking place between 17 and 21 September 2018. As the school is opening in a phased manner, it is currently only accredited to offer the European Schools' curriculum up to fifth year secondary, (ages 4 to 16), with a further accreditation agreement extending to the European Baccalaureate programme years (sixth and seventh year secondary) due in the future.  Campus and Facilities  The EEBA is located on the grounds of the Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôArgenteuil, a nineteenth century estate, with extensive park and woodland. The school is equipped with modern class rooms and laboratories, an inside sports hall, outdoor sport courts and recreational grounds. The Ch√¢teau itself hosts the school canteen, music rooms, a small theater, and a boarding house for students age 15 and up.

Grigori Rasputin, a trusted friend of last Tsar of the Russian Empire Nicholas II, often passed the Dubrovnoye. During the Civil War here took place the 51st Rifle Division of Vasily Blyukher. According to Pavel Petrovich Popov, the Veteran of Labor of the Soviet Union, by that time there was one hundred twenty yards in Dubrovnoe. In 1928 Pavel Petrovich led the village Council and organised the first kolkhoz named \\"Red plowman\\". In 1931 other collective farms were organised: in Kosmakovo village ‚Äî \\"Red dawn\\", in Shchuchye village ‚Äî \\"May 1st\\", in Motushy village ‚Äî \\"Paris commune\\". In World War II around 180 people went to the front from Dubrovinckiy Council. Most of them did not return. During the first three years of the war the rest of the villagers produced 540, 486 and 394 workday on the fields and farms. = Motushy village = Until 1903 Tatar settlement on the Tura river was called Matushevskie yurts after the nearby lake. In 1903 there were 35 settlement houses, inhabited by 88 men and 80 women. There also were a mosque, a school and a steamship pier. In July, 1919 the villagers witnessed the uprising on the Death barge. According to them, 2000 Red Army prisoners were shot as a result of the insurrection on the steamer \\"Irtysh\\". In 1968 cadets of \\"Tyumen College of water transport\\" established the memorial in memory of the rebels. = Kosmakovo village = Founded in XVII century on shores of the Bagaryak lake. From archival documents it is known that in 1868 in Kosmakovo was 55 yards, where lived 240 men and 220 women. There was a bakery, one school, three shops and a chapel. = Shchuchye village = The village was founded in 1641 with the name Monastic. One version of the toponym origin is that only men lived here, forming the so-called monastery. Confirming this there was a special territorial dialect. In 1868 the village had 69 yards, with a population of 605 inhabitants. By 1903 there already was 102 yards. = Veselyj settlement = The barrack-type village built in postwar years for deportation repressed peasants.

In the same year the highest resolution on the satisfaction of the petition and a decree on the opening of a subscription to collect the necessary funds was issued.

The project of the sculptor Mikhail Mikeshin, who also designed the monument \\"Millennium of Russia\\" in Novgorod (1862) was also not approved, because Yermak towered over the Two-headed eagle, the Tsar's emblem. The layout of this project is now on display in the Museum of the History of Don Cossacks. Mikeshin proposed a new version of the monument to Yermak, which he drafted taking into account the official comments made. This project was adopted by the Commission in 1896, but in the same year Mikeshin died. The following years had brought Vladimir Beklemishev to work on the monument. = Construction = On 6 May 1903, at the Cathedral Square in Novocherkassk took place a ceremonial laying on the monument to Yermak. The place was consecrated and dwellers of Novocherkassk showered it with flowers. On 6 May 1904, exactly one year after the date of foundation, the grand opening of the monument began. The procession with army regalia and battle flags passed from the Don Museum Square to the monument of Don Ataman. After the proclamation of the eternal memory of the conqueror of Siberia, the Army ataman Konstantin Maksimovich opened the curtain of the monument. Everyone who stood there for the first time saw the majestic image of Yermak clutching battle flag in one hand, and the crown of the conquered Siberia in second hand.  Description of the monument  The 4-meter sculpture is mounted on a granite boulder. In his left hand Ermak holds a banner, and in the right hand the Siberian crown, which symbolizes the conquered lands of Siberia, which he presented to the Russian state. On the front side of the pedestal there is an inscription: \\"To Yermak 1904 from Don people 1581\\" (the year of the opening of the monument and the year of the beginning of the conquest of Sibir Khanate). On the back side of the pedestal there are inscribed words in gold: \\"to Don Ataman Yermak Timofeevich, the conqueror of Siberia, from a grateful posterity. In honor of the tercentenary of the Don. Rested in peace in the waves of the Irtysh on August 5, 1584.\\" And here are also the words of Russian historian Nikolai Karamzin: \\"Russia, her history and Russian Church will always remember Yermak.\\" The pedestal is surrounded by a massive chain on granite piers.

The Beta was released on September 8, 2016 on Microsoft Windows. The main storyline revolves around the human colonisation of an alien planet, in which a new colony must be built in order to survive. Gameplay Aven Colony involves building a new human city on Aven Prime, an alien planet light-years away from Earth. The player oversees construction, resources, and people within the colony. The colony must be built from scratch and over time additional colonists will arrive. There are many different buildings, ranging from tent-like buildings to skyscrapers and a space elevator. These buildings serve many purposes including oxygen creation, living quarters, food cultivation, resource mining, protection of the colony, exploration and expansion. Flying drones are used to build, upgrade, recycle and manage everything in the colony. The colonists themselves travel around walking or in Hover cars. There is a day and night-cycle, and during the night cycle everything freezes over so food will not grow and solar panels work at 50%. The colony must also cope with various environmental conditions including storms, dust devils, toxic gas and shard storms. There is an alien called \\"the creep\\" which grows over buildings covering them in its tentacles; however, drones can be built to remove \\"the creep\\". There are other alien threats that may attack a colony including plague spores, hovering guardians and cultist airships, these attacks can be defended against through building defensive structures to protect the colony. Research can be carried out to improve the crops that can be grown, and there are over a dozen different types of crop. There is a morale system which can be influenced by several different factors including food, living conditions, employment, crime and social policies set by the player. Regular elections are held in which the citizens can sack the player if morale gets too low. Ancient alien artefacts can be discovered and used as the colony expands. Sub-colonies can be built in the area surrounding the main colony, there are 4 different types of sub- colony. To control all of this there are twelve different menus which give the player information about the colony. These menus include details on citizens, employment, commute, happiness, crime, resources, electricity, water, air, crops, structures and drones. The game speed can be adjusted up to eight times normal speed and paused at any time. There are 3 different camera modes each giving a different view of the colony and surrounding area, these modes include: surveillance camera mode, satellite camera mode and an overworld map. There are two main game modes. Campaign Mode includes many missions to complete, and within each mission there are objectives that the player must meet in order to complete the mission. In Sandbox Mode, initial conditions can be set, then a colony can be built on an open-ended world with no specific objectives. Development Aven Colony was in development for two and a half years. The beta was published on 8 September 2016 on Itch.io and the full version of the game was released for download on 25 July 2017 on Steam, Itch.io, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. A physical boxed version was available from 1 August 2017. Since the release of the game there have been multiple small updates adding new features, improving performance and fixing bugs. The first major update was published for PC on 31 August 2017, and was labelled as \\"Content drop one\\". This update added 11 new buildings including; a space elevator, a decontamination unit and new decorative buildings. This update also has a new sandbox map called \\"Serpent Isle\\" and a new transport system using Hover cars. This content drop was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on the 19 December 2017. The second major update for the game was released for PC on 5 December 2017. This update was labelled as \\"Content drop two: The Expedition Update\\".

The event is often called the Tainted Blood Scandal or Contaminated Blood Scandal. It was not in the terms of reference of the inquiry to examine events in England, a statutory public inquiry has never been held in England. The Penrose Inquiry was set up by Scottish Government under the Inquiries Act 2005 and cost ¬£12,123,754.http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/downloads/1447242115-Penrose%20Inquiry%20-%20Publication%20of%20Costs.pdf It was announced by Nicola Sturgeon on 23 April 2008. The Rt Hon Lord Penrose was the chairman of the inquiry. Publication Lord Penrose did not attend the launch of the final report which was held on 25 March 2015 in Edinburgh. He was reported to have been too ill to attend. Criticism The final report of the Penrose Inquiry was widely branded a whitewash after it made only one recommendation, that steps should be taken to offer blood tests to anyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before 1991 and who has not already been tested for hepatitis C. The Inquiry did not apportion blame. Professor John Cash who was a former director of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service said the executives responsible were able to avoid giving evidence. \\"Did Lord Penrose get to speak to the people with the real answers? No, he didn‚Äôt,\\" \\"He tried but through no fault of his own he couldn‚Äôt get to the truth. He ran into serious problems because the Inquiries Act meant there was a whole area he could not address\\". Five deaths were examined as outlined in the inquiry's terms of reference, these were, Reverend David Black, Mrs Eileen O'Hara, Alexander Black Laing, Neil Mullen and Victor Tamburrini. Out of these 5 cases, only 1 of the victims was a Haemophiliac. The 1 haemophilia case was a Hepatitis C infection that occurred in the 1960s, before Factor concentrates were in use, meaning that the case did not relate to the relevant period which is regarded at the mid-1970s‚Äì1980's.

It is endemic to southern Africa. The species preferentially attaches itself to the hottentot. Description A. capensis has a smooth, slate-grey carapace, with a five-segmented pleon. The head bears short antennae and is triangular, the telson is rounded. The legs end in powerful hooks that are used to grip the parasitized fish. The well-developed uropods often extend well beyond the body. The species can grow quite large and may reach a length of 60 mm. Distribution The species occurs on the coast of southern Africa, from the west coast at Walvis Bay in Namibia to the east coast at East London in South Africa. Ecology The members of the family Cymothoidae are commonly referred to as \\"fish lice\\" (although this term is also used for the family Argulidae, which are also crustaceans but not closely related). Like all Cymothoidae, A. capensis is an ectoparasite that attaches to a larger host and feeds off its body fluids. The species parasitizes fish, preferentially the hottentot Pachymetopon blochii, a mid-sized sea bream common in shallow- water kelp beds on the southern African coast. The isopod attaches itself to the fish's head above and behind the eye, rasps a hole into the skin, and consumes blood and other body juices. It was found that the size of A. capensis individuals and the hottentot it parasitizes were positively correlated, indicating that both host and parasite grow together. Both length and weight of parasitized fish were found to be slightly below those of unaffected fish, which suggests that host condition suffers to some extent from the presence of the isopod.

In 1909, Crocker was valued between $10 million to $20 million. The 75-room, three-story Crocker Mansion was built in 1907 for Crocker in Mahwah, New Jersey, and is one of New Jersey's historical landmarks.General Historic Information , Crocker Mansion. Accessed March 31, 2011. Early life He was born on February 10, 1856 in Sacramento, California, the second of four children of the railway magnate Charles Crocker. His three siblings were William Henry Crocker, Harriet Crocker Alexander, and Charles Frederick Crocker. Following his father's death in 1888, an estate was left of $30,000,000. George was willed $6 million on the condition that, \\"after the space of five years continuously he shall abstain from the use of spirituous, vinous, and malt liquors to the extent that he shall not during this period have been intoxicated.\\" Crocker continued his life in San Francisco as \\"one of the most reckless young men about town when reckless young men thereabouts were common\\" for three more years. He then began his probation and entered a sanatorium. Career Three years after his father's death, Crocker notified his brothers, who were the trustees of his share, that his abstinence had begun. After his time at a sanitorium, Crocker purchased a 375 acre ranch near Promontory, Utah that was not profitable. He worked on the ranch until his probation was completed, turning it into a successful concern. He then came into his inheritance. After applying for bonds in his name through the courts in September 1898, on October 27, 1898, he was awarded $500,000 for five years of total abstinence from intoxicants. After he returned from Europe on his honeymoon, his brothers turned over $6 million to him. Afterwards, he opened an office in New York City after moving there. He went into business, with his main endeavor involving the operations and expansion of businesses his father had invested in, including land, railroad, banks, coal, gas, iron, sugar, and chemical companies. He was successful as a businessperson, and was listed in Who's Who in America. A member of Tuller & Co. and Tailer and Company, banking houses, he was also a director of several corporations, including Trust Company of America. At Southern Pacific Railroad, he was second vice president. When the Consolidated National Bank was organized in New York City on July 1, 1902, the fourteen directors included Crocker, Mortimer Wagar, John W. Griggs, Henry C. Brewster, and Perry Belmont. Following his 1906 expedition that failed to reach the North Pole, Robert E. Peary reported in his book that he had sighted distant land from the heights of the northwestern coast of Ellesmere Island. He named it Crocker Land after San Francisco banker George Crocker, one of his financial backers. It is now known that Peary's report was a hoax, as he wrote in his diary at the time that no land was visible. At the time, an expedition (Crocker Land Expedition) was organized, and ultimately failed. In 1909, Crocker was valued between $10 million to $20 million. Club memberships George was active in sports in New York. He was involved in clubs such as the New York Athletic Club, the Midday, City, Metropolitan, and the Tuxedo Union League,. Personal life and death George Crocker built the 75-room Crocker Mansion from 1901 to 1907 in New Jersey. In 1997 the mansion was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Shortly after moving to New York City, in 1894 he married Emma Rutherford, a widow from California with three grown children. They afterwards set out on a wedding trip to Europe. Mrs. Crocker became known as a hostess in New York, holding lavish events at their villa in Newport and their 1 East 64th Street townhouse in New York. In 1901, the couple began working on the construction of a new mansion in New Jersey, after purchasing the Darling estate. Utilizing the old Darling home as his own during the building process, he commissioned the architect James Brite to build a 75-room, 45,000 square feet house modeled on Bramshill House, a Jacobean mansion in England. The estimated cost was $2,000,000 ($ million when adjusted for current inflation). His wife Emma was a member of the St. Thomas Episcopal Church in Manhattan. She died from stomach cancer in July 1904 in Newport. In her memory, he provided $10,000 for the construction of a church in Ramsey, New Jersey, the Protestant Episcopal Mission of St. John. After completing plans for the church, in March 1905 he sailed for Europe on the White Star liner Cedric for a six weeks trip. Until June 1906, George Crocker worked on building the small church dedicated to his wife. In 1907 he learned that he had stomach cancer as well. On June 24, 1908, Dr. Sam Lambert operated on Crocker, realizing in the process survival was improbable. On July 4, 1909, Crocker arranged for a large fireworks displays with rockets and some 20,000 firecrackers in the Ramapo hills. He returned from Ramsey to New York in September 1909. In November 1909, the Times reported that Crocker had but weeks to live and was in intense pain, and that his brother William had hurried home from Europe. He had a second operation with William T. Bull for the hopes of obtaining pain relief, and died on December 4, 1909 at his home at 1 East Sixty-fourth Street with family members. He was about 54 years old. With the funeral at St. Thomas's Episcopal Church at 5th Avenue and 53rd Street, he was buried with his wife and parents at the Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland, California. Crocker's Darlington and New York City houses were sold after his death. Darlington was sold to the banker Emerson McMillin, who lived in the estate until his death in 1922. The George Crocker Special Research Fund at Columbia University for cancer research received the monies earned from the sale of the houses.

It forms the northern extension of the New Caledonia‚ÄìLoyalty Islands arc, and is now actively subducting under the Vanuatu/New Hebrides arc. The subduction of the DER is responsible for the anomalous morphology of the central part of New Hebrides arc whose movement more closely matches the north-east direction of the subducting Australian Plate (the rest of the New Hebrides arc rotate west in front of the southward expanding North Fiji Basin). The name honours French naval officer Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux, explorer of the south-west Pacific in the late 18th century. Geological setting The DER extends north from the New Caledonia ridge to the New Hebrides/Vanuatu Trench and thus separates the North Loyalty Basin ( ) to the south from the West Santos Basin ( bsl) to the north. The DER has a western and an eastern part with distinct morphologies: the arcuate western part is an elongated graben flanked by two near-parallel horsts; the eastern part widens to the east where it split into a southern and northern ridge. The southern ridge is composed of 36 -old extinct stratovolcanoes. It is a seamount chain on-top of a broad east-west- trending ridge. The seamounts, including the Sabine Bank which reaches bsl, are the volcanic remnants of an old island arc. A -deep scarp separates the southern ridge from the North Loyalty Basin to the south. The Bougainville Guyot, south of Santos, forms the eastern continuation of the seamount chain and is a Middle Miocene andesitic volcano covered by Oligocene to Miocene lagoonal limestone. The northern ridge, a more continuous ridge similar in composition to the Mariana fore-arc, forms part of an abandoned, north-facing oceanic trench which has been subducting under the New Hebrides island arc during the last 2‚Äì3 Ma. The northern DER reaches bsl. The western part of the DER, a platform with an average depth of , is bounded to the north by a scarp. Early Eocene MORB-type basalts (mid-ocean ridge) have been dredged from this scarp whereas Late Eocene MORBs have been dredged from a ridge north of it. The western platform has experienced an Eocene compressional phase followed by Middle Miocene to Quaternary uplift and tilt. The eastern part of the DER is an abandoned plate boundary which was part of a south-dipping subduction zone before the Miocene. In the eastern part the northern and southern ridges are separated by the Central D'Entrecasteaux Basin, a smooth surface covered by sediments, which is deepening eastward to west of Santo Island.

Description The hottentot has a bronzy grey color, with darker fins. The small mouth contains five rows of incisors in both upper and lower jaw, but no molars. Adults are commonly around 25 cm in length at the age of maturity, but may reach up to 54 cm, with a maximum recorded weight of 2.67 kg. Distribution and habitat The species occurs in the southeastern Atlantic, from Angola to Cape Agulhas at the southern tip of South Africa. Vagrants have been recorded as far east as the mouth of the Tsitsikamma River. The hottentot inhabits kelp beds on shallow rocky reefs, as well as blinders, subtidal reefs and offshore pinnacles in deeper waters (up to 55 m). Juveniles are restricted to the kelp beds. Ecology The species is a generalist and feeds on seaweeds, algae, crustaceans, worms, molluscs, sea urchins, and occasionally small fish. It may spawn all year round, with peaks in summer and winter. Individuals generally live to an age of about 12 years, but may exceptionally reach an age of up to 21 years. Generation length is about 9 years. The hottentot is a frequent host of the parasitic isopod Anilocra capensis. Conservation The hottentot is an important species in a variety of smaller-scale fisheries (artisanal linefishery, recreational shore and ski- boat fishery) and occurs as bycatch in gill-net fishery. However, it appears not to be exploited to an extent that is damaging stocks, and is common in a number of protected areas in its range. It is therefore classified as Least Concern by the IUCN.

Synopsis After an overview of people who have a passion for raising poultry, the film focuses on three main characters ‚Äî Brian Caraker, a musical theater performer from Branson, Missouri; Brian Knox, an engineer of high performance race engines from New Hampshire; and Shari McCollough, a homemaker from Crawfordsville, Indiana.

On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100 based on 4 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Writing for The New York Times, Helen T. Verongos stated that \\"these chicken people, with deep connections to their birds, make for a fun and at times astonishing film.\\" In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Katie Walsh wrote that \\"the film proves to be more than just a glimpse into a world that's easy to titter at. Haimes delves into the larger issues and psychological motivations that drive the kind of obsession that allows one to breed award-winning poultry.\\" Joe Leydon, in a review for Variety, called it an \\"illuminating and amusingly entertaining look at the thriving subculture of competitive poultry breeders\\", and wrote that the film \\"generates a fair amount of suspense, [... but] it also abounds in moments of ineffably charming comic relief\\". A review for The Village Voice criticized the filmmaker for not probing deep enough with some of the subjects and their \\"larger failure [...] in never finding much of a compelling reason for us to care about this subculture beyond surface geek-show intrigue.\\" References External links *Chicken People at the distributor's website Chicken People at the International Documentary Association 2016 films 2016 documentary films American documentary films American films English-language films Films set in Ohio Films shot in Ohio Documentary films about agriculture in the United States Documentary films about competitions ","title":"Chicken People"},{"id":"52799727","text":"Manjot Singh (born 12 October 1987) is an Australian cricketer.

History The desire for a church in Woodville was first expressed at a meeting on St Stephen‚Äôs day in 1843, and this prompted the construction of the church, and the dedication was selected based on the day of that initial meeting. The church was built on a one-acre plot of land given by Barbara Rawdon-Hastings, Marchioness of Hastings to the designs of the architect Henry Isaac Stevens. The corner stone was laid on 7 November 1845 by Richard Curzon-Howe, 1st Earl Howe, in the presence of Hon. Capt. Curzon and the Rev. Marmaduke Vavasour. Transept arches were built into the walls to provide for any future enlargement. The apse was laid with Minton black, buff and red encaustic tiles. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Peterborough, Rt. Revd. George Davys on 8 December 1846.

History and strength The Second Boer War broke out in South Africa in October 1899. By December, the British army had seen several defeats in battle, and was unable to lift the sieges of Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley as fast as had been communicated to the public. The government realised they needed considerably more troops to win the war, and larger parts of the regular army, militia and yeomanry regiments were sent to South Africa. Due to the manpower needs of the army, an appeal came from Queen Victoria in February 1900 for ex-soldiers to sign up for Home Defence duties. The following letter appeared in newspapers at the time, signed by Sir Arthur Bigge, Private Secretary to the Sovereign: Shortly thereafter, Royal Reserve battalions were formed from veteran soldiers in the United Kingdom for Home Service. Time-expired warrant officers, non commissioned officers and other ranks between the ages of 21 and 45 would enlist for service in the United Kingdom for a period of one yearQuoted in Scaife, Arthur Hodgkin The war to Date (1 March 1900) T.F.

In total, 17 battalions were raised, officered partly by those who were already compulsorily in the Reserve, and partly by ex-officers who voluntarily responded to the call \\"for Queen and Country\\". Many of the other ranks also enlisted on their one-year engagement from loyalty to the Queen, but quite a number principally joined up to claim the large bounty which was on offer. The men were used for routine duties and ceremonial tasks, for example furnishing the guard at Osborne, and lining the route for the funeral of Queen Victoria. The task of keeping everyone occupied were reported to be rather difficult, however.http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/GENBRIT/2004-11/1100000885 The Regiments were disbanded at the end of 1901, when the Second Boer War drew to its close. After the Royal Reserve Regiments were phased out, the Royal Garrison Regiment was formed, to relieve regular infantry battalions in overseas garrisons like Malta and Gibraltar. Many of the RGR's members had previously been in one of the Royal Reserve Regiments.

History  At the end of 19th ‚Äï the beginning of the 20th century in the mansion were held receptions, musical performances, thrown balls and organized other remarkable city life events. The ground floor was rented by various trade organizations, in particular, by Shamkovich's Pharmacy and \\"Julius Garohov's Trade House.\\" On the second floor, there were living rooms. Among other rooms, the hall contrasted with higher ceilings and luxurious interior decoration. The scene was located in the corner of the hall. From the hallway, it was possible to go to the balcony with a balustrade. Along the facade on Khalturinsky alley, there were situated a dining room, a living room, a bedroom, and other premises. Each of the rooms had been decorated with stucco, which was painted with oil. The main entrance to the building is situated at the corner of Bolshaya Sadovaya street and Khalturinsky alley. On both sides of the mansion there were placed false windows, decorated with stucco architraves. Above the corner portion rises a gazebo with a dome ‚Äï it is the composite core of the mansion. On the second floor there is a balcony with a balustrade. The facade is richly decorated with stucco: decorative vases in niches, Atlantes, caryatids, medallions, sea shells, garlands and floral ornament. In 1920 Chernova was evicted by Soviet authorities, and the building was nationalized. On the ground floor and in the basement located there was situated \\"Pharmacy ‚Ññ 2\\", and on the second floor ‚Äï \\"Children's commune ‚Ññ 5\\". According to 1926 data, the second floor was occupied by a Sewing school, while the first one was still a place for \\"Pharmacy ‚Ññ 2\\", for a newly established joint-stock company, and for \\"tenants of nine families living cramped: seven people in one room of the former trading room.\\" On February 2, 1926, the mansion became Provincial Prosecutor's Office. Since 1940, the building housed the Communist party archive of the Rostov region, and after the collapse of the Soviet Union ‚Äï the State Archives of the Rostov region. By the early 2000s, the building was in disrepair. In 2001, the reconstruction of the building was carried out, during which the house was demolished and reconstructed again.

History  In 1927 Polish Ministry of Military Affairs ordered a universal narrow gauge tank locomotive for field railways in the First Locomotive Factory in Poland (Fablok), fit for easy conversion to 600 or 750 mm track gauge.Pokropi≈Ñski (2016), p. 27-28, 204 It was newly designed in Fablok and designated as W2A type. It was a D (0-8-0) axle arrangement tank locomotive, powered by a simple twin engine, working on a saturated steam, developing 100 hp power output (Dn2t). The locomotive was completed in Fablok (serial number 179), although a chassis with engines was made by Warsaw Steam Locomotive Building Factory (WSABP), and a boiler by Fitzner-Gamper-Zieleniewski in Sosnowiec. The locomotive was completed in 1928, but in spite of a successful design, a military commission refused to accept it, for unclear reasons. Instead, it was bought for Polish State Railways, with a number D3-1002. It stationed first in Lipno depot, on 600 mm gauge Lubicz - Sierpc line. After the line was replaced by a standard gauge one in November 1937, it was moved to Myszyniec, working on Ostro≈Çƒôka railway (it is not clear, if it was done in 1938 or 1940, after working on Jƒôdrzej√≥w railway in a meantime). During World War II, the Germans, who took over Polish railways, renumbered it as 99 1575. After the war, in 1947 the locomotive was given a designation Tx3-427. According to new regulations, in 1961 the locomotive was included into Tx26 class and renumbered to Tx26-427 (tank locomotive, x - D axle arrangement, 26 ‚Äì Polish origin locomotive designed in 1926, which in this case was an errorPokropi≈Ñski, Bogdan (2000).

After the war the locomotive worked still on Ostro≈Çƒôka railway. It was usually used with an additional tender. In 1973 it was withdrawn, pending a main repair, but instead, in 1975 it was given to Railway Museum in Warsaw. The locomotive was stored in a bad condition on a side track in Biskupin, and only in 1993 it was given to a museum depot in Chab√≥wka, where it was reconstructed and placed on exhibition.

He primarily works on reflective surfaces such as metal, creating paintings of great luminosity and depth ‚Äì expansive colour fields with vague allusions to landscape. Apart from painting, his work comprises large art installations fashioned through light.  Biography  Bruno Kurz spent his childhood in Kressbronn am Bodensee (Lake Constance). He is the oldest son of Rupert Kurz (born 1933), a metal worker, and his late wife Gertrud Kurz (1934‚Äì2007). During his secondary education at the Knaben-Realschule (all-boys secondary modern) Lindau, Bruno Kurz was introduced to oil painting by his mathematics teacher. After finishing his Abitur (German university entrance qualification) at the Technisches Gymnasium (comparable to grammar school) Friedrichshafen, he started an engineering degree, which was disrupted by being called up for Zivildienst (compulsory paid community work as alternative to military service). Subsequently, he did a year's travel, going by ship to Israel and Rhodes, where he created his first group of paintings and finally decided to study painting. After his return, Kurz studied at the Freie Kunstschule (Free Art School) Stuttgart under :de:Gerd Neisser (1980‚Äì81) and at the :de:Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Academy of Fine Arts) under Per Kirkeby and :de:Max G. Kaminski (1981‚Äì86). Bruno Kurz has been concerned with particular aspects of light and colour since his youth. While still studying, he undertook extensive travels to Southern Europe and India (1983/84 and 1986/87), later to Mexico and Canada.http://www.mollwo.ch/Kurz/vita.html The experience of nature and new realms of colour and light led to numerous experiments with painting surfaces and colour substances, and major work cycles evolved. A project grant on the theme of \\"Heimat\\" enabled his first journey to Northern Europe in 1998, where he visited the Outer Hebrides, the Oakland Islands, the Scottish Highlands and Bergen in Norway. Celtic symbols and their typical merging of circle and cross, Irish-Scottish monasticism and its connections with the Lake Constance region, together with impressions of nature formed the basis for a large project-related exhibition in his home town Kressbronn am Bodensee, featuring expansive installations. From 2000 onwards, such experiences of landscape effected a new series of pictures: Over ten years, he worked on his Hebrides Cycle,Hebrides, Katalog zur Einzelausstellung, Werkzyklen: BeLiv 1995‚Äì1997, Tears of God 1998‚Äì2000 und Hebrides 2001/2002, hg. v. Bruno Kurz 2003. where, for the first time, the horizontal layers of delicate colour fields emerged that characterise his work; they would become a core aspect of his future painting practice. Since 2013, the artist has frequently travelled to Iceland and Greenland. \\"What's important is, that an artist just like our 20th century Canadian painters, goes north in search of the light and in search of interesting themes. Everyone knows that the northern artists went south for discovering the light. The best example of that is Provence. But here we have an artist who goes north because the light is just as beautiful, strong and pure. So Bruno Kurz comes along in the depths of winter and goes round the Hebrides in his kayak and is impressed by what he sees. Without any photos, of course, he goes back to his studio, and paints with a good distance, this distance that is so important for painters so they are not overwhelmed by nature, but have had time and space to absorb and process it.\\"Gallerist Odon Wagner.

With Georg Schalla,http://www.kunstprojekte.de/ he founded the artists' group KUNSTRAUM IWKA and campaigned for the preservation of the huge industrial buildings on the premises. He co-organised a series of exhibitions titled Letzte Arbeitsberichte IWKA I and II, which was vital for saving the building Hallenbau A, now Zentrum f√ºr Kunst und Medien, ZKM (Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe). Kunstraum IWKA2, 1986 Yet the artists could not ultimately prevent the destruction of the other buildings and the sale of the estate ‚Äì in December 1986, the Karlsruhe City Council authorised the premises to be demolished, including the enormous art installations in the industrial buildings. For their gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) KUNSTRAUM IWKA, the artists group were awarded a project grant by the Kunstfond (Arts Fund) Bonn, which entailed a documentary exhibition in Bonn.http://www.brunokurz.de/bruno- kurz/ausstellungen/ Bruno Kurz created large-scale art installations in his first studio on the IWKA premises. He wanted to generate an adequate counterbalance to the colossal industrial building through large-scale art works and installed huge geometric sculptures of plastic sheeting that reflected the sunlight coming through the sawtooth roof (Installation Kunstraum IWKA, 1987): \\"Rain water puddles caused by the leaking roof cast back vast reflections and gave the artist further stimuli for his work. In 1988, for the first time, he used water as a sculptural material in space. The clarity of the installations he has since created is a result of these early architectural-monumental experiences of space. Further down the line, he created his spectacular installation 'aller Farben blo√ü' in the baroque halls of the Ettlinger Schloss (Ettlingen Palace).\\"Sabine Heilig, Kunsthistorikerin. In: Bruno Kurz. Lichtpassagen, Katalog zur Einzelausstellung, hg. v. S√ºdWestGalerie, Niederalfingen/Aalen 2006. Gr√ºner Saal in the Ettlinger Schloss (Ettlingen Palace), 2003 Taking inspiration from the monikers \\"Green, Blue and Red Salon\\" and their corresponding tapestries, he installed coloured plastic film in the windows of the halls and created a sequence of coloured light. Notwithstanding the wide range of artistic possibilities offered by three-dimensional space, the formal, aesthetic and conceptual means of his installations clearly relate to his painting practice.  Teaching  Apart from working as a freelance painter, Bruno Kurz also took on a variety of teaching posts in Higher Education. From 1993 to 1997, he taught Drawing at the P√§dagogische Hochschule (University of Education) Karlsruhe, 2002‚Äì2008 Painting at the Europ√§ische Kunstakademie (European Academy of Fine Arts) Trier, and 2002‚Äì2007 Experimental Painting at the Landesakademie (State Academy Schloss Rotenfels).http://www.murgtal.org/Media/Attraktionen/Akademie- im-Schloss-Rotenfels He is also concerned with art historic analysis and with conveying the practical application of various approaches to painting to lay- persons. Since 1984 he has been part of the team of tutors at the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe.http://www.kunsthalle- karlsruhe.de/de/vermittlung/kursangebot.html .  Abstract landscape painting  Nord Passage 4, 2016 Based on the composition of a classic landscape painting, Bruno Kurz creates delicately structured landscapes of colour, which do not reference an actual place any more but depict moods and atmospheres ‚Äì floating between stillness and energetic dynamism. \\"The quietness emanating from his works results from their concentration, from their formal and chromatic restraint and the conscious rejection of the spectacular in his pictorial subject matter: landscape and colour space. Despite their discreet harmonies, the works of Bruno Kurz are actual bundles of energy.\\"Sabine Heilig, Kunsthistorikerin. In: Bruno Kurz. Lichtpassagen Emphatically horizontal lines and areas can visually expand beyond the frameless margins of the picture into infinity, and, in conjunction with vertical colour gradients, form a Perpetual motion, effecting a balance of opposite movements ‚Äì to the point of apparent stillness. This impression is emphasised through his choice of the square format. Since Kazimir Malevich, the square is considered the absolute form of abstract painting in the 20th century, and, in Bruno Kurz' work, finds its way into landscape painting. It does not become a theme in itself, but lends an almost archaic force to the imaginary horizons and changes in direction of the colour gradients between sky, water and earth. The square creates an unusual section of these colour-landscapes while, at the same time, focussing the permanent oscillation between states of matter. Energy fields and directions of movement are geometrically fixated and concentrated as in a cross, the symbol of the union of extremes, of synthesis and proportion. It combines time and space. This primeval formal element of art history serves as the subcutaneous base structure in most of Kurz' paintings. It is subliminally discernible in particular geometric components, vertical and horizontal lines, cross-hatching on metal or in brush strokes and enhances the meditative aura of the paintings. Square and cross double the force that originates here, apparently still, yet always in motion: both in the variations of incidence and reflection of light and in the gaze of the beholder. Through the consistent reduction and abstraction of the forms and elements, an unfathomable, almost sacral depth is created. Or as one of his German galleries points out: \\"Inspired by the classical composition of the countryside, Bruno Kurz produces nuanced, abstract color landscapes of unbelievable illumination and depth.\\"  Colour  Bruno Kurz in his studio, 2016 In addition to his strict formal aesthetics, Kurz also examines the physical qualities of his chosen materials. The painter experiments with diverse dyes and paints, merges synthetic elements, pigments, inks, water colour, acrylic and oil paints or resins and fillers in unconventional combinations and layers of colour. ‚Ä≥Horizontal layers provide the colours a clear compositional order.(...) At the same time, their colour space appears to pulsate in fields of light. (Several paintings in this series are named after Lucifer, a deity in Roman myth who personified the Morning Star and whose name means 'Light-Bringer'.) Reflective surfaces ‚Äì consisting of resin, India ink glazes or transparent silk gauzes layered over a vertically delineated metal background ‚Äì afford the works a striking luminosity and shimmering colour spectrum.‚Ä≥http://www.odonwagnergallery.com/artist/bruno-kurz The materials are applied in such a way that they keep generating new effects and perplexing visual impressions. The eye of the beholder can immerse itself deeply in these colour landscapes and thereby encounter extreme opposites ‚Äì from glassy, translucent glazes to relief-like three-dimensional colourstrips. Beneath the seemingly two-dimensional surface, multiple planes and pigment layers shine through, which evolve through a long process of overpainting and modifying extremely subtle textures. \\"Kurz's surfaces are richly worked, with paint developed in rich layers. His textural surfaces, inscribed with scumbles, swipes, scrapes, and miasmas of color, capture the rich and varied lands through which he travels in search of beauty.(...) Kurz's bright colors and abstract imagery follow in the tradition of Abstract Expressionist color field painters ‚Äî such as Mark Rothko and Jan Kolata.\\" The transformation of the conventional canvas painting into a colour space floating in front of the wall is the result of years of engagement with the three core themes Colour ‚Äì Material ‚Äì Light.  Material and light  For Bruno Kurz, painting does not start with paint, but with the choice of the painting surface. He utilises very different materials such as wood, canvas, silk or paper. ‚Ä≥Through layering as well as the combination of unconventional materials ‚Äì gauze, sheet metal, resin ‚Äì the artist accomplishes wild optical impressions. Words such as transparency, levity, and dissolution describe the effect best. (...)The thoroughly reflective resin layers and metallic surfaces create light tricks and reflections that define the atmosphere of the works.‚Ä≥http://www.galerie- reitz.cologne/en/bruno-kurz-2/ Over the last few years, the artist has increasingly used sheet metals; in his studio, he prepares and alters their surfaces with grinding machines. Thus, light and colour will later be differently absorbed and reflected. The first horizontal aspects are already generated in the primary material and influence colouring and colour gradients from the outset. Twilight 1, 2016 Many titles of his work (e.g. Lichtf√§nger (Light Catcher)LICHTF√ÑNGER, catalogue of solo exhibition, pub. Galerie Wesner, Konstanz 2009. or Translucent HorizonsTranslucent Horizons, catalogue of solo exhibition, pub. Odon Wagner Gallery, Toronto 2012. , National Library of Canada) demonstrate the mindset behind Kurz' oeuvre: navigating the phenomenon of light. The geometric lines of the paint application or the material constitute the basic structure inherent in any new work. Within these lines, Kurz works on the theme of light with always freshly composed and varied arrangements of colour and materials. \\"There is no such thing as the right light for my paintings\\", the painter points out: every incidence of light, every change of the beholder's position effects a new situation, new hues and colour fields emerge ‚Äì his work appears to change constantly. ‚Ä≥Depending on the incidence of light and position of the viewer, the paintings may be perceived in a variety of ways. The multiple viewpoints offered by the works are the hallmark of their vitality.‚Ä≥http://www.odonwagnergallery.com/artist/bruno-kurz Yet it radiates an unexpected calm, which is the result of optimised formal reduction and concentration. In Kurz' work, light does not visualise anything representational, but, beyond the interplay of colours, indicates the potential for inwardness and a capacity for knowledge. Thus the painter creates the conditions for meditation. His paintings offer vanishing points and spaces of tranquility: \\"In our hectic world, stillness is the true spectacle.\\"Gallerist Cyprian Brenner.

The publishing group launched as Atria Books in 2002. The Atria Publishing Group was later created internally at Simon & Schuster to house a number of imprints including Atria Books, Atria Trade Paperbacks, Atrai Books Espanol, Atria Unbound, Washington Square Press, Emily Bestler Books, Atria/Beyond Words, Cash Money Content, Howard Books, Marble Arch Press, Strebor Books, 37 Ink, Keywords Press and Enliven Books. Atria is also known for creating innovative imprints and co-publishing deals with African-American writers as well as known for experimenting with digital or non-traditional print formats and authors. As of 2017, Judith Curr is the President and Publisher of the Atria Publishing Group. Early years The Atria Books imprint was launched in 2002 by Judith Curr. According to a Publisher's Weekly interview with Curr marking the imprint's 10th anniversary, the name Atria is \\"plural for a place where things grow and flourish.\\" Curr wanted a name that embodied their intentions to build a bridge between the reader and the writer. Because she was starting a new business inside an old established one (Simon & Schuster was founded in 1924), Curr also gave it an \\"A\\" name so it \\"would be at the top of everyone's memo and everything is in alphabetical order at a publisher.\\" In 2005, Simon & Schuster acquired Strebor Books International and publisher of popular fiction by African-American writers including Black Erotica by Zane. Zane would remain the publisher of the imprint with an office in Maryland. The publisher had been founded independently in 1999. In 2013 it was announced that publisher Kristina Laferne Roberts had declared bankruptcy. In 2009, Atria was the first publisher to partner with Vook. Curr took on publishing the first four of them as she wanted to integrate digital practices into Atria. Curr recognized that digital and traditional printing practices would go \\"hand in glove.\\" The work with Vook lead to the creation of the Atria Smartbook‚Äîa physical piece of paper with QR codes throughout the text for enhanced content. Curr told the Digital Book World, \\"every week I get a report that tells me how many people have interacted with those pieces of content. And now I've got this whole idea of how to turn the book itself into a store.\\"  2010s  Atria Books publishes a wide variety of both fiction and non- fiction and strives to publish a diverse set of books and authors. This includes programs for diverse voices, Internet personalities and self- published authors with proven track records. In some cases, an editor is given their own imprint with their name on it as with Emily Bestler in 2011. In 2011, Atria signed a co-publishing deal with Cash Money Records founders Bryan \\"Birdman\\" Williams and Ronald \\"Slim\\" Williams for an imprint called Cash Money Content. Birdman's intention was to cross-promote books at music events. The imprint is headquartered in Miami. As of 2012, 25% of Atria Books list of 98 titles was part of an African-American publishing program overseen by Malaika Adero, Vice President and Senior Editor. Notable authors include Walter Mosely, Faria Chideya, Blair Underwood and Vickie Stringer. Strebor Books an imprint founded in 1999 by author Zane is also under the Atria Publishing Group. In an interview on NPR, Adero described the African-American market for books as quite varied. Atria Books Espanol, publishes titles aimed at Hispanic readers in both English and Spanish. In 2012, Simon & Schuster reorganized their adult publishing imprints into four main groups with Atria Publishing as one main group. Howard, a religious imprint based in Nashville was placed under the Atria Publishing Group. In 2012, Atria partnered with the UK publisher Short Books' list to form Marble Arch Press to introduce international authors to American readers. In 2013, Atria Publishing Group launched 37 INK to focus on a diverse list of books and authors including a focus on African-American voices. In 2014, Atria Books launched Keywords Press to publish books by Internet personalities. The first set of authors included YouTube personalities, Shay Butler (aka ShayCarl), Shane Dawson, Justine Ezarik (aka iJustine), Connor Franta and Joey Graceffa. The launch was part of a deal between Atria Books and United Talent Agency (UTA) who represents a number of Internet personalities. Curr stated that many of the books from the imprint would be crowdsourced with authors working directly with their fans. The New York Times called the move an \\"acknowledgement by traditional media companies that YouTube celebrities are more than just niche entertainmers with quirky appeal, and can be marketed to a broader audience. Atria Books demonstrated its ability to build a bridge between reader and the writer in 2014. Fans of Colleen Hoover, a romance author, took to social media and successfully persuaded Atria books to publish a free e-novella by Hoover into a print book. Atria Books had received 5,000 tweets, posts and memes under the #FindingCinderella campaign. Atria Books has also focused on finding and publishing successful self-published authors. In 2013, they signed 18 books by 8 self-published authors. Atria signs on a self-published author, reworks the previously published ebook if necessary, and then republishes them in new e-book and paperback editions. When looking for at a potential author they look at how emotionally connected the online reviews are with the storyline and characters. In 2015, Atria launched Crave (ThisIsCrave.com), an application and subscription service for romance readers where subscribers receive one audio installment from a book each day. Atria also launched Enliven Books in 2015, an imprint launched from author and tea entrepreneur, Zhena Muzyka, and focused on publishing spiritual and wellness books. Muzyka runs the publishing imprint from a yurt in Ojai, California. Muzkya reported to Publisher's Weekly that the name for the imprint was the result of a phone call with her mother. Her mother told her, \\"As soon as you hang up the phone you are going to hear a word in your head.\\" Muzkya said that the first word she heard was Enliven which means \\"to add color, to uplift.\\"  Imprints  * 37 INK, publisher of African-American and other diverse voices * Atria Books, general publisher * Atria Espa√±ol, publisher of Spanish language books with a focus on Spanish readers in the U.S. * Atria Trade Paperbacks, general trade paperback publisher * Atria Unbound, ebook editions of Atria publications * Beyond Words, a co-venture between Atria Books and publisher of mind-body- spirit titles including the Secret * Cash Money Content, a co-venture with Cash Money Records * Emily Bestler Books, publisher of fiction and non-fiction * Enliven Books, publisher of Spiritual and Wellness books * Howard Books, publisher of Christian books * Keywords Press, publisher of books by Internet personalities * Marble Arch Press, co-publishing venture with Short Books of the United Kingdom * Strebor Books, publisher of African-American books as well as Black Erotica * Washington Square Press, founded in 1959 as part of Pocketbooks and paperback publisher of classic and contemporary fiction  Notable Authors  The following are notable authors who publish under Atria Books.

Crowley (born May 14, 1986) is an American politician and the 7th County Executive of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. He is the first African American to serve as the county's top official, and, at age 33, also the youngest. He previously represented Milwaukee as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, serving from January 2017 until June 2020. Biography Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Crowley's parents struggled with narcotics addiction in his youth and lost their home when he was just ten years old. His parents eventually divorced, and he suffered eviction from two more homes before graduating high school. Under the mentorship of Reggie and Sharlen Moore, and their community organizing group, Urban Underground, Crowley became interested in issues of policing and local government. Crowley graduated from Bay View High School and attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee from 2008 to 2012, though did not obtain a degree. He worked as an organizer for United States Senator Russ Feingold on his 2010 re-election campaign, then became a legislative aide to Milwaukee County Supervisor Nikiya Harris Dodd. When she was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate, he worked as her policy director in Madison. Crowley made his first attempted at elected office in 2016, when he ran for Milwaukee City Council. He came in third in the February nonpartisan primary election and did not advance to the general. However, later that month, his employer, Senator Nikiya Harris Dodd, announced she would not seek re-election in the 6th district seat. The move prompted Assemblymember La Tonya Johnson to declare for that office, creating an open race in the 17th Assembly District. Crowley jumped into the race and won the Democratic primary with 56% of the vote. He was unopposed in the general election and entered office on January 3, 2017. He would go on to win re-election in 2018. In November 2019, after incumbent Chris Abele announced he would not seek re- election, Crowley announced his candidacy for Milwaukee County Executive. In the February primary election, Crowley came in a close second to state senator Chris Larson, defeating County Board Chairman Theodore Lipscomb, Sr., and businesswoman Purnima Nath. Crowley received the endorsement of outgoing executive Chris Abele, who had been challenged by Larson for his seat in 2016. Abele would go on to spend heavily on behalf of Crowley in 2020 through his Leadership MKE political action committee. The April election was significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Wisconsin, but when the votes were tallied on April 13, Representative Crowley narrowly defeated Senator Larson. Crowley was sworn in as County Executive on May 4, 2020, from his front yard, due to ongoing shelter-in-place policies in the state. He resigned his seat in the Assembly effective June 18, 2020, as required to comply with a 2015 Wisconsin law prohibiting a person from simultaneously serving as a member of the legislature and a county executive. Personal life and family Crowley's parents recovered from their addiction struggles and remain involved in his life. He married his wife, Ericka, in 2016, they have two daughters together as well as a daughter from Ericka's previous relationship. Crowley is the vice chair of the Milwaukee chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, and a member of the Milwaukee Urban League Young Professionals, and the Milwaukee NAACP.

As the rest of the ambrosia beetles, E. fornicatus larvae and adults feed on a symbiotic fungus carried in a specific structure called mycangium. In E. fornicatus, the mycangium is located in the mandible. The combination of massive numbers of beetles with the symbiotic fungus kill trees, even though the fungus alone is a weak pathogen. Euwallacea fornicatus breeds in various live hosts and is considered a severe pest of several economically important plants, such as: tea (Camellia sinensis), avocado (Persea americana), citrus (Citrus spp.) and cacao (Theobroma cacao). Identification = Adult = Lateral view of the adult beetle Adult females are range between 1.9 and 2.5 mm long. They are bulky, dark brown or black and the frontal edge of the pronotum has a row of saw-like projections. Moreover, specimens have erect setae organized in rows in the elytral declivity with a costa in the posterolateral edge. As many other ambrosia beetles, males are significantly smaller, with non-functional wings. = Larvae = Larvae are similar to all other larvae in the family Curculionidae; legless, c-shaped and a sclerotized head capsule.  History of expansion  The tea shot hole borer has been known to cause devastating damage to tea (Camellia sinensis) in at least ten different countries, including India and Sri Lanka where it is a major economic pest.Danthanarayana W. 1968. The distribution and host range of the shot-hole borer (Xyleborus fornicatus Eichh.), Tea Quarterly, 39:61-69. In 2009, specimens matching the description for E. fornicatus were introduced into Israel, where they were documented as vectors of a new fungal plant pathogen in avocado trees. In 2012, similar fungal disease was recorded in avocado trees in California (CA). Since 2007, specimens of E. fornicatus have been documented in Florida on avocado trees. However, it is not considered a health threat because no disease is expressed.  Taxonomy  Even though several taxa were synonymized under the name E. fornicatus due to morphological similarity, some of the clades are different in terms of economic severity. Euwallacea fornicatus is considered a species complex, with several clades that occur in separate regions of Southeast Asia and develop in different hosts. Phylogenetic work using the DNA mitochondrial gene COI suggested that there are three major clades within the species E. fornicatus, supporting the idea of at least three different species with phylogeographic boundaries within the species complex. The first clade proposed, E. fornicatus sensu stricto (commonly called the tea shot hole borer), is originally from southern Southeast Asia and was introduced into Hawaii and Florida. A second clade, the Kuroshio shot hole borer, is believed to have originated in the Pacific Islands and has since been introduced into San Diego county, California. The third clade is thought to originate from a more northern range in Southeast Asia and to have since been introduced into Los Angeles, California, Israel and South Africa. This last clade has been given the common name polyphagous shot hole borer in reference to the very broad host range. It has been severely affecting avocado trees in association with several Fusarium species.Kasson, M.T.; O‚ÄôDonnell, K.; Rooney, A.; Sink, S.; Ploetz, R.; Ploetz, J.N.; et al., 2013. An inordinate fondness for Fusarium: phylogenetic diversity of fusaria cultivated by ambrosia beetles in the genus Euwallacea on avocado and other plant hosts. Fungal Genetic Biology 56, 147‚Äì157. Its impact has impacted many trees in San Diego County, as far south as the Tijuana River Valley Regional Park. Multiple populations of the E. fornicatus complex have been introduced throughout the world, causing different damage in each region where they have been recently introduced.  Etymology  See Wallacea, region of Indonesian islands named after the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace. Management The most recommended management strategies include sanitation of infected hosts and avoiding the spread of infected material. Chemical control can be considered in hosts which are not part of human consumption and some attempts of biological control have been made with little success. Moreover, resistant or tolerant varieties are considered an important aspect of the integrated pest management for this pest.

He wrote thirty plays and eight books, and was a columnist for twenty years; he was named \\"The Most Successful Playwright\\" by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and \\"The Most Successful Columnist\\" by the Turkish Journalists' Association. He was married four times and had four children. Erduran served as a military interpreter during the Korean War. Personal life Ahmet Refik Erduran was born to H√ºsamettin Erduran and his wife Refika in Salacak in the √úsk√ºdar district of Istanbul, Turkey on February 13, 1928. He had an elder sister named Leyla, who was four years older. He grew up with a French Catholic nanny, who spoke only French; thus he learned French from a very early age. In 1938, he entered Robert College in Istanbul. After graduating from the high school, he went to the United States in 1947, where he was educated in the history of theatre at Cornell University. Returning home, Erduran entered compulsory military service as a reserve officer, and was sent to the Turkish Brigade during the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953) to serve as an interpreter. He married four times. In 1950, he first married poet N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet's stepsister Melda Kalyoncu, who gave birth to their son Murat in 1953. This marriage lasted five years. He married journalist Leyla Umar in 1958. The couple divorced two years later, but remained together until 1977. In 1992, Erduran married Sevim T√ºlay G√ºng√∂r. which also lasted for five years. In 1997 Erduran married Pƒ±nar Duygu (born 1965), the daughter of his third wife from her earlier marriage. She bore him a son in 1997 and twins in 2002. The marriage was annulled in February 2003 by a court decision for being immoral after a claim was filed by a lawyer. In June 1951, Erduran helped N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet (1902‚Äì1963), whom he greatly admired, to flee Turkey for Moscow, via Romania by boat on the Black Sea.

Texas, 380 U.S. 400 (1965), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court involving the application of the right of to confront accusers in state court proceedings. The Sixth Amendment in the Bill of Rights states that, in criminal prosecutions, the defendant has a right \\"...to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor...\\" In this case, a person arrested in Texas for robbery was deprived of the ability to cross-examine a witness when the lower court allowed the introduction of a transcript of that witness's earlier testimony at a preliminary proceeding instead of compelling attendance by the witness at trial. Prior history On the night of June 16, 1962 the manager of a 7-Eleven in Harris County, Texas was robbed of $375 (currently equivalent to $). The robber fled from the store but the store manager claimed to see him talking to another man at a nearby street intersection. Responding officers found an abandoned automobile with a flat tire and a still-warm engine at the intersection. A police dog tracked a scent from the car's front seat to the 7-11 store and then across the street, into a wooded area, and then to the front yard of a nearby house. There they found Bob Granville Pointer hiding in the shadow of a tree and arrested him. A search of Pointer recovered $81 in his wallet and $65 in his shoe. At a preliminary hearing (called in Texas an \\"examining trial\\") was held. Examining trials have a prosecutor, defense and take place before a magistrate or district judge. Examining trials require the prosecutor to show the presiding officer that probable cause exists and determines if the accused will be granted bail and on what conditions. If the prosecutor demonstrates evidence supporting probable cause to believe the accused committed the charged act, then the accused is indicted. In Pointer's examining trial the chief witness was the store manager, Kenneth W. Phillips. Phillips identified Pointer and testified that he had been robbed by Pointer at gunpoint and feared for his life. According to Article 1408 of the Texas Penal code in operation at the time, robbery with violence or \\"putting in fear of life or bodily injury\\" was punishable for terms of confinement of five years to life, no matter the amount. Pointer and co-defendant Lloyd Earl Dillard were not represented by any attorney in the hearing. Dillard asked Phillips a few questions but Pointer did not. The examining trial ended with indictments of both Pointer and Dillard. After the examining trial, Phillips moved to California and did not return to Texas for Pointer's criminal trial in District Court. The prosecutor introduced the transcript of Phillips' testimony from the examining trial instead. Pointer's attorney objected to the inability to cross-examine Phillips but was overruled. The jury convicted Pointer and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, Pointer's attorney repeated the argument that Phillips' non-appearance deprived Pointer of his right to confront and cross- examine witnesses against him, as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. The Texas court held that Pointer could have cross-examined Phillips at the examining trial and chose not to. Considering the responsibility of a layperson like Pointer to carry out such a cross-examination without assistance, it further ruled that examining trials did not require counsel because they preceded indictment. Decision Pointer's case was part of a series that defined how the Sixth Amendment applied to defendants in state courts. The Supreme Court took this case to decide if failure to appoint an attorney to represent Pointer at the preliminary hearing unconstitutionally denied him the assistance of counsel as it had then-recently decided in . The Court was also concerned with the deprivation of the right to cross-examine witnesses, as it had referred to in . Earlier in the same term, the Court had defined the minimum rights under the Sixth Amendment as: Justice Hugo Black held that: *The right of an accused under the Sixth Amendment to confront and cross- examine witnesses against them is a fundamental right :*This right is essential to a fair trial :*The Fourteenth Amendment makes this right is obligatory on the States *The introduction of the transcript was a clear denial of the right of confrontation and the statement was made without an adequate opportunity for cross-examination. Effects of the decision Pointer's conviction was reversed and returned to Texas for further proceedings. When Texas revised its Criminal Code, it changed the law on examining trials. It was now explicit that the hearing could proceed only after \\"...allowing the accused, however, sufficient time to procure counsel.\\" Further, it also said \\"...the magistrate may appoint counsel to represent an accused in such examining trial only...\\" This case was part of the process of applying rights guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the states. It was later cited by one of the most famous United States Supreme Court cases, .

Frank Patterson(September 3, 1896 - June 19, 1918) was a test pilot for the Army Air Corp, and was killed in the crash of his DH.4M, AS-32098, at Wilbur Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio on June 19, 1918. He was piloting a flight test of a new mechanism for synchronizing twin machine guns and the propeller when a tie rod broke during a dive from 15,000 feet (4,600 m), causing the wings to separate from the aircraft. Frank Stuart Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, on November 6, 1897. He was the son of Frank Jefferson Patterson and Julia Shaw Patterson. The elder Patterson and his brother, John H. Patterson, founded The National Cash Register Company (NCR) and figured prominently in local Dayton history. Frank attended Yale University, but graduated \\"in absentia\\" in the spring of 1918 because he, like many of his classmates, had joined the Army. He enlisted in May 1917 and was commissioned in September as a first lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps with the aeronautical rating of pilot. Lieutenant Patterson was assigned to the 137th Aero Squadron as a test pilot at Wilbur Wright Field the following May. On June 19, 1918, little more than a month after his arrival, Lieutenant Patterson and his aerial observer, Lieutenant LeRoy Amos Swan, went aloft in their DH-4 to test newly installed machine gun synchronizers, allowing the guns to fire between the blades of the propeller as it rotated at high speed. They completed two trials successfully, but during a steep dive on the third test a tie rod securing the wings broke and the airplane's wings collapsed. The aircraft crashed, killing both crewmen. About 5 years following Lt. Patterson's death, the Patterson family formed the Dayton Air Service Committee, Inc which held a campaign that raised $425,000 in 2 days and purchased 4,520.47 acres (18.2937 km2) northeast of Dayton, greatly expanding the available land adjacent to Wilbur Wright Field and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field. In 1924, the Committee presented the deeds to President Calvin Coolidge for the construction of a new aviation engineering center. On July 6, 1931, a portion of Wright Field east of Huffman Dam was separated from Wright Field and redesignated \\"Patterson Field\\" in honor of both Lieutenant Frank Stuart Patterson and the contribution of the Patterson family. Patterson Field and the adjacent Wright Field were officially merged on January 13, 1948 as a base for the newly created U.S. Air Force, and was named the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (\\"Wright-Patt\\" as it is called colloquially). Patterson is interred at Woodland Cemetery in Dayton.

Early political career  Julme first aligned himself with Duvalier during his own election in the Haitian region of Ganthier, which included the city of Croix-des-Bouquets. Julme was a large landowner in the area. A story about Julme attempting to deliver the Duvalier-Julme ballots to election stations but having his tires slashed is recounted in the book Haiti: The Duvaliers and their Legacy. He later vocally defended Duvalier's changes to the Haitian constitution to make himself President-for-Life, representing Haiti at the OAS.  Later political career  In 1967, after bombs went off near the Presidential Palace, Julme was swept up in a purge and imprisoned along with other former members of Papa Doc's cabinet at Fort Dimanche. When he was released, Julme was re-offered his position but refused. Duvalier continued to send Julme letters in an attempt to seduce him to work with him again, saying things such as \\"To my old comrade Jean M. Julme, in remembrance of the battles which ended in 22 September 1957.\\" Julme was eventually released but did not rejoin the regime.

The species is known from Miocene sediments exposed in Oregon, US. It is one of several extinct species belonging to the living section Rubra. History and classification Acer ferrignoi is known from a small group of fossils from a late Miocene fossil site listed as USGS 9737. The site is located near Lolo Pass in the northern Oregon Cascade mountains. The fossils were first studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. They determined that fossils belonged to an undescribed Acer section Eriocarpa species. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. ferrignoi in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name ferrignoi is in recognition of James P. Ferrigno, who located and supplied access to collections of fossils housed in the Smithsonian Institutions National Museum of Natural History. At the time of description the A. ferrignoi holotype specimen, number NMNH 396125, along with the four paratypes were part of the National Museum of Natural History collections. Wolfe and Tanai suggested A. ferrignoi may be a late Miocene descendant of Acer chaneyi which lived from the late Oligocene to the Middle Miocene before going extinct. While A. cheneyi leaves sometimes have three lobes as in A. ferrignoi, more often they were five lobed, which is not seen in A. ferrignoi. The similarity in the structure and concave outlines between the two species' lateral lobes were major factors in Wolfe and Tanai's suggestion of relation between the two species. Following the Acer taxonomy structure defined by Japanese botanist Ken Ogata, they placed the species and related fossils into the Acer section Eriocarpa. Later work on the systematics of the genus resulted in section Eriocarpa being included into section Rubra. Description Leaves of Acer ferrignoi are simple in structure, with perfectly actinodromus vein structure and range from ovate to widely ovate in shape. The base of each leaf is rounded, with the petiole ranging up to . The leaves are dissected into three lobes, with the lateral lobes being one half to three quarters as long as the median lobe. The median lobe is generally triangular in outline and the two lateral lobes are narrow and triangular. There are three primary veins with between three and ten secondary veins branching off from the outer primaries. The secondary veins branch from the primaries at angles of 40¬∞ to 70¬∞ and run straight to the margins or arch gradually with external vein forks that reach the margins.

History Wittelsbacher Palais The red brick building, with a Neo Gothic exterior, was built as a royal prince's palace from 1843 to 1848 by Friedrich von G√§rtner and Johann Moninger for Crown Prince Maximilian, the later King Maximilian II; After the death of G√§rtner the palace was completed by his co-worker Carl Klumpp. From 1848 to 1868 it was the retirement place of King Ludwig I, 1887 to 1918 it served as residence of Ludwig III. At the beginning of August 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War the monarch spoke from the balcony of the Palais to the population. In 1919, it was the meeting place of the Aktionskommittee of the Bavarian Soviet Republic.

It was described by the English carcinologist Lancelot Alexander Borradaile from specimens collected by Arthur Willey in the south Pacific in 1895‚Äì1897 and is the type species of the genus Parhippolyte. Description Parhippolyte uvae appears to have two colour forms, a red and white banded form is found in Hawaii while in other parts of the range this species is bright red. It has long slender legs and antennae. Distribution Specimens of Parhippolyte uvae have been collected from Aldabra in the western Indian Ocean, Kakaban Island and Halmahera in Indonesia, Tiniguiban Islet in the Philippines, the Loyalty Islands, Fiji, Ellice Islands and Oahu in Hawaii. It has also been recorded in the Mascarene Islands of R√©union and Mauritius. Biology Parhippolyte uvae occurs in anchialine pools and marine caves. In Hawaii it occurs in lava pipes and caves whereas on other islands it is found in more open areas. P. uveae varies in its behaviour from location to location. For example, the population of P.uveae in the lagoon at Kakaban Island appears to be photophobic and was only recorded being active at night, while the population from Tinguiban Islet in the Philippines were described as being \\"sun-lovers\\". The adult P.uveae fed in depths of 1-2m in the lagoon and were not found in the adjacent open reef. The differences in colouration and behaviour may indicate that P. uveae is made up of more than one cryptic species. Where it occurs P.uveae is quite numerous and has been said to appear \\"in masses\\". Cultural references On Vatulele Island in Fiji populations of bright red Parhippolyte uvae occur in a complex of anchialine grottoes and pools. Several legends have arisen to explain the origin of these populations and the Fijians call P. uveae ura damudamu which means \\"red prawn\\" or ura buta which means \\"cooked prawn\\". On Vatulele the islanders treat the prawns with great respect, and they have a traditional practice of ‚Äúcalling‚Äù the prawns using chants and clapping. It is taboo for the islanders to kill or harm the prawns in any way, although local guides have been allowed to enter the pools to show them to tourists for some years. Aquarium trade Parhippolyte uvae is available in the aquarium trade and is said to be relatively easy to keep and breed. Some research is being carried out in establishing breeding facilities for P. uveae to provide animals for the trade. P. uveae has been featured on a Fijian postage stamp, the first anchialine species so honoured.

Bavarian home signals were still being used by the Deutsche Bahn until 2002 and Bavarian distant signals even after that.  Distant signals  The disc of the Bavarian distant signal in the clear (Fahrt frei erwarten) aspect In the territory covered by the old Bavarian state railways and even after the introduction of standardisation by the Reichsbahn, the Bavarian distant signal continued to be widely used until the mid-1960s. The illustration (right) shows a Bavarian distant signal. In the 'caution' aspect it displays a round disc. The disc had a diagonally- oriented hinge in the centre. On changing from the 'warning' aspect (Vr 0) to the 'clear' aspect (Vr 101 or 102) both halves of the disc folded to the rear, so that, in their place, a signal arm appeared pointing up and to the right. Because this movement looked like a butterfly closing its wings, the Bavarian distant signal was called the \\"butterfly signal\\" (Schmetterlingssignal). Until 1922, the disc was green with a white border and white dot in the centre; thereafter it was orange with a white border. The signal arm and signal mast were also green and white until 1922; then red and white. An advantage of this design over the standard distant signal of the Reichsbahn was that it displayed a clearly visible signal aspect in each position. As a result, it did not need a distant signal board (Vorsignaltafel). This was hesitantly retrofitted by the Reichsbahn from 1936. After the Second World War, however, distant signals without signal boards could still be found in Bavaria. Thanks to its construction, the Bavarian distant signal could also be fitted to the mast of a home semaphore signal, so that, for example, the combination of 'proceed slowly' and 'expect clear or proceed slowly' (Hp 2, Vr 102) could be displayed on the same mast using three semaphore arms. In this case, the coloured lens of the distant signal was mechanically blocked when the home signal was set to the 'stop' aspect and, sometimes, even the disc mechanism was hidden. From 1922, the night aspects of Bavarian distant signals corresponded to the standard Vr 0 and Vr 1. Until 1922, however, a green light meant 'caution'. For the 'clear' aspect, the green lens was folded away and a white signal lamp appeared. The Bavarian distant signal was unusual in that it only knew two aspects. 'Caution' always meant \\"expect a stop signal\\". In addition, to begin with, a distant signal was only installed, if the home signal could not be seen within the train's braking distance.  Home signal  Arm of a single-armed Bavarian home signal The main difference between Bavarian home signals and those of the Reichsbahn was the shape of the semaphore arm. On Reichsbahn signals the tip of the semaphore is circular in shape; on Bavarian signals it is diamond-shaped (see illustration). The second semaphore arm on twin-armed semaphore signals had a slightly different shape. Instead of the being at the very end of the arm, the round disc was slightly closer to the mast, so that the end of the arm projected beyond it. The predecessor to the second arm was the 'proceed slowly' disc (Langsamfahrscheibe), which could be folded away to the side when required. Up to about 1880 this was a round, green and white disc. There were two variants of signal arm: a slotted, lattice-like arm and a solid arm made entirely of enamelled metal. The mast was made of two steel profiles (Zores sections); metal steps being fitted to the mast so that they were parallel to the track. Until 1922, the colours of the night signals were unusual, like those of the distant signal: * Clear (Freie Fahrt): white light * Proceed Slowly (Langsamfahrt): white light above a green light * Stop (Halt): red light In the original design the lantern lenses for the Stop aspect were placed in the centre of the signal arm. 'Proceed Slowly' (Fahrt frei) was displayed to trains using a green light (from 1876) on the signal lanterns - on multi-arm signals the uppermost lantern. From 1893 to c. 1922 a white light was used. 'Proceed slowly onto a branching track' (Fahrt frei in ein abzweigendes Gleis) was indicated on two-armed home signals from 1893 to 1922 by a white light with a green light vertically below it. From 1948 the lower, green, light was exchanged for a yellow one. Sometimes the arms were bent back at the tips to enable the illumination by signal lanterns at night. During the changeover between 1922 and 1936 the 'proceed slowly' aspect was indicated by two green lights. Only after that time was the green lens on the second arm replaced by a yellow/orange one.  Rest signal  The 'rest signal' (Ruhesignal) on a Bavarian home signal was signalled using an additional aspect: 'rest' (Ruhe). It was used in Bavaria from 1893 to 1975. It was the last signal from the state railway era that was retained in the signalling book of the Deutsche Bundesbahn. This was a single or twin-armed semaphore signal, which took over the function of an exist signal and enhanced it with an additional signal aspect: 'rest' (Ruhe, HpRu). The term 'rest' meant that the railway vehicles were to remain on the allocated track, although shunting was permitted. If the arm was moved to its default position (Halt) the associated track was to be immediately cleared. The aspect, 'rest', was indicated by a downward-pointing semaphore arm or, at night, by a blue light. The Deutsche Reichsbahn marked the signal with an additional board with the letters Ru on it, in order to distinguish it from a normal home signal. The semaphore arm of the rest signal had the same dimensions as those of the Bavarian home signals. For those familiar with modern railways, the sense of this signal aspect is hard to understand. During its period of use, there was often a signal box at each end of the station or there were areas of hand-operated points that were set by pointsmen. The 'rest' aspect indicated to the pointsmen and shunters that they could \\"do what they wanted and store what they wanted\\" on the track so designated. However, they could not use any tracks where the signal displayed a different aspect.  Track blocking signal  The Bavarian track blocking signal (Gleissperrsignal) is the largest of all the blocking signals. The round signal lanterns displayed a round, white milk glass disc towards the train. This had a horizontal, black bar across it. Unlike the later Reichsbahn standard design, the black bar was not turned; instead the whole lantern was rotated through 90¬∞ on its pedestal, so that the side of the lantern was presented to the train. The side of the signal lantern had an almost square milk glass window. At night the lantern was lit internally.  References   Literature  * Robert Zintl: Fahrt frei.

As a descendant of the British broodmare York Gala (foaled in 1939) she was a more distant relative of Theatrical and Prince Royal. Racing career =2003: two-year-old season= Spring On his racecourse debut Milk It Mick started a 33/1 outsider for a five furlong maiden race at Haydock Park on 19 April and finished fifth of the eighteen runners behind Caldy Dancer. Three weeks later he started 4/6 favourite for a similar event at Beverley Racecourse and recorded his first success as he gained the advantage inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Harry Up. Summer On 1 June Milk It Mick was moved up in distance and started odds-on favourite for a minor race over six furlongs at Windsor Racecourse in which he was ridden as at Beverley by Martin Dwyer. Carrying top weight of 127 pounds we took the lead from the start and stayed on well in the closing stages to win by one and a quarter lengths from the Richard Hannon, Sr-trained Goblin. The colt was then again stepped in class and distance to contest the Listed Chesham Stakes over seven furlongs at Royal Ascot on 18 June. After chasing the leaders he kept on well in the closing stages to finish third of the thirteen runners behind Pearl of Love and Tycoon. Eight days later at Salisbury Racecourse he started 2/1 favourite for a race over six furlongs in which he was ridden Richard Quinn. He was always traveling easily took the lead a furlong out and won \\"comfortably\\" by one and a quarter lengths from Stay Young. On 9 July Milk It Mick contested the July Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse but appeared to be outpaced in the closing stages and finished fourth of the eight runners behind Nevisian Lad, Cape Fear and Byron. Nine days later in the Listed Rose Bowl Stakes at Newbury Racecourse he finished fourth again beaten just over a length by the winner Venables. In August he was moved back up to seven furlongs for the Washington Singer Stakes at Newbury in which he was ridden by Kieren Fallon and stayed on in the closing stages to finish third of the eight runners behind Haafhd. At the end of the month he started at odds of 9/2 in an eight-runner field for the Group Three Sirenia Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse and finished second, beaten half a length by Barbajuan after staying on in the closing stages. Autumn On 12 September Milk It Mick started a 20/1 outsider for the Group Two Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. He was restrained by Quinn before making some progress approaching the final quarter mile but never looked likely to win and finished fifth behind Lucky Story who won from Auditorium and Haafhd. The 51-year-old Pat Eddery took over the ride when the colt ran in the Group Three Somerville Tattersall Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 2 October and started at odds of 12/1. The only one of his seven opponents to start at longer odds was Bachelor Duke, who went on to win the Irish 2,000 Guineas. After being hampered at the start he was settled towards the rear of the field before making rapid progress approaching the final furlong. He took the lead in the final strides and won by a neck from the favourite Bayeux with Bachelor Duke another neck away in third. Despite his win in the Somerville Tattersall Stakes Milk It Mick was given little chance and started at 33/1 when he stepped up to Group One class for the Dewhurst Stakes (his twelfth run of the season) over the same course and distance sixteen days later. He was partnered by Darryll Holland who took the ride after Lucky Story was withdrawn from the race. The Middle Park Stakes winner Three Valleys started favourite ahead of Snow Ridge (Royal Lodge Stakes), Duke of Venice and Haafhd whilst the other runners included Balmont, Antonius Pius (Railway Stakes), Cape Fear and Bachelor Duke. Milk It Mick was held up by Holland towards the rear of the twelve-runner field as the Aidan O'Brien-trained outsider Troubadour set the pace from Duke of Venice. He began to make rapid progress on the wide outside in the last quarter mile and went past Three Valleys to take the lead inside the final furlong. The favourite rallied but Milk It Mick maintained his advantage and won by a head with Haafhd taking third ahead of Bachelor Duke. After the race Holland said \\"I had my head down and kept pushing. I only got the ride yesterday because Lucky Story came out. But what a ride to get\\". Osborne commented \\"He's such a genuine horse. This is the second time we've taken a firm decision on how to ride him. He's out of a five-furlong mare but once we dropped him in and got him to relax he showed he could get home\\". =2004 & 2005: three and four- year-old seasons= On his three-year-old debut started favourite for a Listed International Trial on the synthetic Polytrack surface at Lingfield Park Racecourse on 3 April but finished second of the nine runners behind the outsider Leitrim House. Two weeks later he contested the Greenham Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) at Newbury and was made the 3/1 favourite in a ten-runner field. He tracked the leaders but faded inside the final furlong and finished fifth, beaten four lengths by the winner Salford City. Despite his defeat he took his place in the field for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket but after starting slowly he never looked likely to win and finished eighth of the fourteen runners behind Haafhd. In his three remaining races of 2004, Milk It Mick was dropped in class but failed to win. He finished third to Mac Love in a minor sprint at Doncaster on 31 July, third to Peter Paul Rubens at Chester Racecourse in August and second to Secret Charm over a mile at Doncaster in September. Milk It Mick remained in training with Osborne as a four-year-old but made no impact in two races, finishing unplaced at Chester in June and at Doncaster in October. =2006: five-year-old season= In 2006 Milk It Mick was sent to race in the United States where he was trained by James M Cassidy. He made a very promising start to his North American career in the Grade II San Marcos Stakes over ten furlongs at Santa Anita Park on 22 January. Ridden by Kent Desormeaux he started a 29/1 outsider but finished second of the eleven runners, beaten a length by The Tin Man. On 4 March at the same track the horse was dropped back in distance, but stepped up in class for the Grade I Frank E Kilroe Mile Stakes and started at odds of 12.4/1 in a thirteen-runner field. Cacique started favourite ahead of the French import Charmo whilst the other runners included Willow O Wisp (Del Mar Derby), Aragorn Senor Swinger (Arlington Handicap), Toasted (Arlington Classic) and Geronimo (Morvich Handicap). Milk It Mick overcame an outside draw to take the lead in the final furlong and held off several late challengers to win by a neck and a short head from Aragorn and Chinese Dragon. Cassidy commented \\"The whole thing was getting him covered up early, but at the same time, we had to try and get over, being in the 13 post. It was kind of a fine line. Kent used him a little bit to get a position, and he was able to tuck him in. You have to tuck this horse in; otherwise, he would have been on the front end doing his thing\\". In April Milk It Mick started favourite for the Grade II Arcadia Handicap at Santa Anita but was beaten into third place behind Silent Name and Chinese Dragon. In May he finished a close third to English Channel in the Turf Classic Stakes at Churchill Downs but was then finished last of the six runners behind Aragorn in the Shoemaker Breeders' Cup Mile at Hollywood Park Racetrack. It was subsequently revealed that the horse had sustained a fractured cannon bone and he missed the rest of the season. =2007: six-year-old season= In 2007 Milk It Mick returned to the track after a ten-month absence to attempt to repeat his 2006 success in the Kilroe Mile. Ridden by Mike Smith he finished fifth behind Kip Deville but was only two lengths behind the winner. He failed to improve on his promising debut, finishing seventh in the Arcadia Stakes and then finishing last of ten in the Turf Classic on 5 May. On 30 May it was announced that the horse had been retired with Cassidy saying that Milk It Mick had never been the same since his 2016 injury. Assessment In the 2003 International Classification for two-year-olds Milk It Mick was given a rating of 118, making him the fourth- best European juvenile of the year behind Bago, Attraction and Grey Swallow. He shared his rating with Lucky Story and Three Valleys making him the joint- highest British-trained colt of his generation. Stud record In August 2007 it was announced that Milk It Mick would begin is career as a breeding stallion in 2008 at the Lone Oak Stud at Newmarket. He stood at the Hedgeholme Stud (County Durham) in 2010, the Haras de la Foret in 2011 and 2012 and the Kelanne Stud (Hampshire) in 2013 before moving to the Norton Grove Stud in North Yorkshire. The best of his offspring has been Miracle of Medinah who emulated his sire by winning the Somerville Tattersall Stakes in 2013.

His coaches tried to help him unlearn this style, recommending he ski with his feet inward and placed special \\"jaws\\" on his ski binding. However, Graf found that he performed longer distances and safer jumps with his V style but the judges only awarded him 15-16 points. The V style was also used by the Swede Jan Bokl√∂v in the late 1980s. In a competition in Karpacz, Graf performed the longest jump but took only 4th place.

After starting his career in 2013, White joined NJPW the following year as a \\"young lion\\". In June 2016, White left for an overseas expedition, during which he worked for the American Ring of Honor (ROH) and the British Revolution Pro Wrestling (RPW) promotions through NJPW's international partnerships. White eventually returned to NJPW in November 2017 and won the IWGP United States Championship the following January. Later in 2018, he betrayed his fellow Chaos stablemates to join Bullet Club, eventually becoming the group's fifth leader. White is also a former IWGP Heavyweight Champion and IWGP Intercontinental Champion. Professional wrestling career =Early career (2013‚Äì2014)= White initially trained under The UK Kid at Varsity Pro Wrestling in early 2013, and made his professional debut on 19 February, working for VPW as well as All Star Wrestling, among other promotions. In early 2014, White met New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW)'s Prince Devitt and competed alongside him in a tag team match for VPW. After the match, Devitt gave White his card and told him to keep in touch. Shortly thereafter, White was contacted by Bad Luck Fale, who said that Devitt had spoken to NJPW officials about White and that he could get him a place as a young lion in the dojo if he wanted it. Several months later, White met with Fale, Devitt, and Shinsuke Nakamura in London, where White accepted their offer and began finalizing his visa to leave for the NJPW Dojo. =New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2015‚Äì2016)= White left for Japan on New Year's Eve 2014, began further training as a young lion upon his arrival, and made his debut for NJPW on 30 January 2015, losing to Alex Shelley. White lost all but eight of his matches in 2015, as is common for young lions in NJPW. In 2016, White began gaining more victories, and on 27 March competed in his biggest match to date when he was defeated by then-reigning IWGP Intercontinental Champion Kenny Omega in a non-title match. White's final match in NJPW took place on 19 June 2016 at Dominion 6.19 in Osaka-jo Hall, when he, David Finlay, and Juice Robinson were defeated by Satoshi Kojima, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, and Manabu Nakanishi.

He teamed with The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) to defeat Kamaitachi and The Addiction (Christopher Daniels and Frankie Kazarian). White and The Motor City Machine Guns eventually formed a stable named \\"Search and Destroy\\" with Jonathan Gresham and Lio Rush. On 8 July, White defeated Lio Rush. At the next set of TV tapings, White defeated Will Ferrara and wrestled Jay Briscoe to a time limit draw. On 19 August, White competed in a fatal four way match against Kamaitachi, Lio Rush, and Donovan Dijak, which was won by Dijak. The following day, White and Rush were defeated by The Briscoe Brothers. On 30 September, White teamed with Kushida and ACH to defeat The Briscoes and Toru Yano in a quarter final match in the ROH Trios Tag Team Championship Tournament.

The following day, NJPW officially announced the match between Tanahashi and White for Wrestle Kingdom 12. On 4 January, White was defeated by Tanahashi in the title match. IWGP United States Champion On 5 January, Jay teased joining Bullet Club; however, White then betrayed Kenny Omega by attacking him with a Blade Runner. A day later he joined the Chaos faction in order to face off against Bullet Club and Kenny Omega, claiming he needed backup in his fight against Bullet Club. On 28 January at the New Beginning in Sapporo, White defeated Omega to become the second IWGP United States Champion in the title's history. On 25 March, he went on to defend the title for the first time against Hangman Page at NJPW Strong Style Evolved Event in Long Beach, California. White would make his second successful title defence against David Finlay at Road to Dontaku. White would make his third defense of the title beating Punishment Martinez on night 2 of the ROH/NJPW War of the Worlds Tour in May. At Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall, White was pinned in a tag team match by Juice Robinson. Because of this, White defended and lost the title to Juice at the G1 Special in San Francisco, ending his reign at 160 days and three successful title defenses. White then competed in 2018 G1 Climax, where he competed in the A Block, where he ended with 12 points (six wins and three losses).

Bullet Club leader (2018‚Äìpresent) White in September 2019 At Destruction, White attacked Tanahashi after his defense of his G1 briefcase. He then attacked Okada, and Okada's former manager Gedo ran out to apparently save Okada. However, he turned on him by hitting him with a chair, and aligning himself with White. On 8 October, at King Of Pro Wrestling, White was defeated by Hiroshi Tanahashi. After the match, he and Gedo attacked Tanahashi, only for Okada to stop it. They were soon joined by Jado and Bullet Club OG in what turned out to be a setup to attack Okada, with White, Gedo and Jado all completing their defection from Chaos to join Bullet Club, becoming the new leader of the faction. At Wrestle Kingdom 13 on 4 January 2019, White defeated Okada. At New Year Dash!!, White would defeat Tanahashi in a 6-Man Tag match and would challenge Tanahashi for his newly won IWGP Heavyweight Championship at The New Beginning in Osaka. At the event, he defeated Tanahashi to win his first world title. At the NJPW Anniversary Event in March, White defeated NEVER Openweight Champion Will Ospreay in a non-title champion vs. champion match. At the G1 Supercard on 6 April, Okada defeated White for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, ending his reign at 54 days and no successful title defenses. White then entered the 2019 G1 Climax, competing in the B Block. Despite losing his first three matches against Hirooki Goto, Tomohiro Ishii and Toru Yano, White would make a comeback and win his next five matches against Jeff Cobb, Shingo Takagi, Taichi, Jon Moxley and Juice Robinson. He would then defeat Tetsuya Naito to win the B Block and advance to the tournament finals. However, he would be unsuccessful in winning the tournament after losing to A Block winner Kota Ibushi, finishing with an overall record of 12 points (six wins and three losses). In the main event of Destruction in Kobe on 22 September, White defeated Naito to win the IWGP Intercontinental Championship for the first time in his career in the main event. At Power Struggle on 3 November, White successfully defended the Intercontinental Championship against Hirooki Goto. However, he lost the championship back to Naito at Wrestle Kingdom 14 on 4 January 2020, ending his reign at 104 days. He followed this with a victory over Sanada at The New Beginning in Osaka on 9 February. After an absence due to the COVID-19 pandemic, White returned on the 21 August episode of Strong, teaming with Bullet Club partner Chase Owens in a loss to Villain Enterprises (Brody King and Flip Gordon). He then participated in the 2020 G1 Climax in the A Block, which he ended with 12 points (six wins and three losses).

They exhibited size-dependent properties especially in the optical absorption and the photoluminescence (PL). Typically, the fluorescence emission peak of the QDs can be tuned by changing their diameters. So far, QDs were consisted of different group elements such as CdTe, CdSe, CdS in the II- VI category, InP or InAs in the III-V category, CuInS2 or AgInS2 in the I‚ÄìIII‚ÄìVI2 category, and PbSe/PbS in the IV-VI category. These QDs are promising candidates as fluorescent labels in various biological applications such as bioimaging, biosensing and drug delivery. However, most of the QDs in the commercial market are cadmium (Cd)-based QDs. Their potential toxicity in the biological environment has been debated over the past decade as the Cd2+ ions released from the QD surface are highly toxic to the cells and tissues. Thus, many researchers have focused on the development of cadmium-free quantum dots (CFQDs) in the past decade. Optical Properties of Quantum Dots Localized surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) characteristically occurs in quantum dots which contain a base metal like Cadmium or Lead. this interaction of nano-scale metals with light is characterized by surface-bound charge density oscillations of the free electrons in resonance with the driving electromagnetic field and produces a specific intensity of light. In Laymen terms, this means the valence electron of the metal oscillates up and down in resonance with the applied electromagnetic field from the natural light thus causing a.different color to be emitted. For metals, the frequency at which LSPR can by tuned by adjusting the size of the nanocrystal, the geometry and the local medium. It is primarily controlled by the free electron density of the material. However, LSPr can occur in semiconductor nanocrystals, which do no contain a base metal but instead contain a doped semiconductor like Zinc Selenide (ZnSe) and Indium Phosphide (InP), which contain appreciable free carrier densities. The LSPRs of semiconductor behave similarly to how LSPR of metals behave, meaning a their size and shape are altered the LSPR frequency should change. The key difference between semiconductor and metal nanocrystals is the ability of the semiconductors to change the \\"electron\\" or carrier concentrations. This concentration can be changed by doping the semiconductor and changing the temperature of the phase transitions. The LSPR theoretically be changed by controlled doping of the semiconductor nanocrystals, by varying the doing concentration, the emitted frequency can be shifted thus affecting the wavelength causing a change in the color or visibility of the light. For example, by using a doping concentration of 1016 to 1019 cm‚àí3, the resulting frequency would be in the Terahertz region, which would not produce visible but it is useful for THz imaging. If the doping concentration is increased to 10 21 cm‚àí3, the corresponding LSPR frequency would be in the near o mid infrared region. However, semiconductor doping can be difficult to accomplish, because during the self-assembly process the nanoparticle self purifies, and as that process occurs it expels dopant atoms to the surface causing no ionized free carriers to be present and LSPR will not be achieved. The dopant atoms are expelled from the bulk material to the surface because thermodynamic equilibrium is not established and it is more energetically favorable for the dopant atoms to be expelled. The tunability of the LSPR for semiconductor nanocrystals can also affect the intensity of the emission color, fluorescence quantum yield, lifetime of excitation, and photo stability. Semiconductor quantum dots are often called colloidal quantum dots because these dots are made from binary compounds. One of the main optical properties of colloidal quantum dots is the ability to produce fluorescence. Chemists use the fluorescence for bio labeling and chemical analysis. Since, Cadmium and other metals have been proven to be toxic in biological environments more and more of the colloidal quantum dots being produced have been cadmium free. The ability to produce the LSPR without Cadmium is useful other labeling techniques like lateral flow immunoassay, which the fluorescence produced by various nanoparticles like carbon nanoparticles, fluorescent dyes, and quantum dots for in vivo biological labeling. In vivo labeling, it important for absorption and emission to occur in the near-infrared region to minimize the light absorption/diffusion by molecules relevant to biological systems and since cadmium free quantum dots are non toxic and ability for the frequency to tuned to the near-infrared region. The low toxicity of the cadmium free quantum allows for more research to be done in biological systems. Applications Doped ZnS/ZnSe QDs, graphene QDs and silicon QDs are the novel Cd-free QDs (CFQDs) types that have been demonstrated their low-toxicity and high colloidal and PL stability for in vitro and in vivo models. DNA/peptide-functionalized QDs have been widely used for targeted cell and tissue imaging and the monitoring of the drug delivery path. For example, various techniques are used for the Cd-free QDs imaging including confocal/multiphoton microscopy, CARS imaging. Through these techniques with Cd-free QDs as stable fluorescent labels, researchers can observe the cell and tissue structure with higher resolutions and in a much more biocompatible way. It is worth noting that these QDs are also flexible to conjugate with other agents such as metallic nanoparticles, radioactive labels and even Raman tags. Thus, multimodal imaging can be achieved with the multifunctional nanotags based on Cd-free QDs. Another useful application is to use these designed Cd- free QDs as nanoplatforms to do non-invasive therapeutics and diagnostics (i.e., theranostics). Recently, Cd-free QDs have also shown great potential in the fabrication of new generation of solar cells and display applications. Quantum dots (QDs) have been a main focal point in the material science industry in the recent years, allowing scientists and engineers to manipulate and test the properties of these nanoscale particles to develop a better understanding of them. A wide variety of QDs are made from toxic heavy metals, like cadmium, which not only prohibits use in biological systems but also can be problematic in a general to a consumer buying a product composed of toxic metals. In order to combat this, researchers have been developing QDs that are not composed of these metals, such as cadmium-free QDs. The medical field has been constantly evolving in an attempt to master the unknown about diseases, such as cancer. Much is unknown about cancer and most treatment routines includes chemotherapy, where toxic chemicals are flushed throughout the body in order to kill the cancer cells. This viscous treatment has been claiming lives for years and researchers have been heavily studying alternatives to this pathway. This is where Cd-free QDs come into play. Michael Sailor and his team including National Science Foundation (NSF)- supported researched at University of California, San Diego (UCSD), have developed the first nanoscale Cd-free QD that is able to glow brightly enough to allow physicians to examine internal organs. This image can last long enough to release cancer drugs before breaking down into harmless by-products. Silicon wafers were used, this way when they were broken down in the body, silicic acid is formed which is already present in the body which is needed for proper bone and tissue growth. Examples ;Zinc Sulfide :One type of material that is used as an alternative to quantum dots that contain cadmium and other heavy metals are zinc type quantum dots. Sulfur, oxygen, and selenium are often attached to the zinc component for the final quantum dots. A very interesting use of zinc sulfide quantum dots is the detection of food toxins including the harmful toxin, aflatoxin- B1. Aflatoxin B1 is a very toxic compound that can cause serious and permanent harm to the human body including liver failure. : Another use for the zinc sulfide quantum dot involves the pure zinc sulfide quantum dot to remove naphthalene by the use of photocatalytic methodology. In this specific experiment a zinc sulfide quantum dot was used to photodegrade the molecule naphthalene which was used as a.model to describe industrial pollutant molecules. Another application of this technique involves using Zinc Sulfide quantum dots to treat industrial waste water. ;Indium :An alternative to the heavy metal quantum dots are quantum dots that contain Indium. One example is the use of CuInS2 quantum dots as fluorescent labels that emit light in the near infrared region of the visible spectrum. In this specific experiment these CuInS2 nanoparticles were placed inside of silica beads. Studies including the cytotoxicity and photoluminescence were performed. Due to the high quantum yield obtained (30‚Äì50 percent), low overall toxicity, and the overall stability of the particles in solution lead to the conclusion that cells could be imaged using synthetic particles. An additional application of the CuInS2 quantum dots involved the drug delivery of an anticancer drug named doxorubicin (DOX). In this experiment the CuInS2 quantum dots were capped with L-cysteine. The anticancer drug was released by the fluorescent quenching of the synthesized quantum dots which additionally provided images of the cancer cells while the drug was being released. Results obtained from the experiment were positive with low toxic effects on the cells from the quantum dots, and good activity from the anticancer drug. :Another type of quantum dot composed of indium is the InP quantum dot. Due to the lower photoluminescent intensity and the lower quantum yield of InP they are coated with a material with a larger band gap like ZnS. :One application with InP quantum dots coated with zinc sulfide involved the creation of LED with tunable photo luminescent emissions. Fabrication of the quantum dot LED involved a blue chip as a blue light source and a.silicon resin containing the quantum dots on top of the chip creating the sample, with good results obtained from the experiment. ;Silicon :A third type of quantum dot that does not contain heavy metals is the silicon quantum dot. These silicon quantum dots can be used in numerous situations which include photochemical and biological applications such as the use of silicon layers for photovoltaic applications. In an experiment using silicon quantum dots near the interface of the substrate and the quantum dots, the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell increased. Silicon quantum dots can also be used as optical labels and drug delivery detection systems, in addition to being used detect formaldehyde in water. The silicon quantum dots emitted stable fluorescence over pH values (2‚Äì14) and exhibited strong tolerance to salt and additional reagents. Detection involving formaldehyde quenching the fluorescence of the water soluble silicon dots showing the application of silicon quantum dots involving biochemical detection.

He is most noted for his plays Lungs, People, Places and Things, Every Brilliant Thing and the stage adaptation of the George Orwell novel Nineteen Eighty-Four which he co-adapted and co-directed with Robert Icke. Macmillan's play Lungs had a major revival at the Old Vic Theatre in 2019, starring Matt Smith and Claire Foyhttps://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2019/lungs Macmillan co-created and wrote the 2020 BBC television drama series Trigonometry with Effie Woods https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p084104h.  Biography  Macmillan first rose to prominence through the Bruntwood Playwriting Competition at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre, winning two awards in its inaugural year for his play Monster, which was also nominated for a TMA Best New Play Award and a Manchester Evening News Best New Play Award. = Major plays = Many of Macmillan's major plays take as their central theme a contemporary socio- political issue: Lungs explores parenthood, People, Places and Things addiction and recovery, and Every Brilliant Thing considers the issue of suicidality.  Lungs  His play Lungs was first produced at the Studio Theatre in Washington DC and has subsequently been performed around the world, receiving its German-language premiere as 'Atmen' at the Schaub√ºhne where it entered the repertory, directed by Katie Mitchell. Lungs has also premiered in South Africa as \\"Longe\\" in 2016 at the Vrystaat Kunstefees, winning the award for Best Upcoming Talent. The British production of the play, starring Kate O'Flynn under the direction of Richard Wilson won a Best New Play award at 2013's Off West End Awards.  People, Places and Things  Macmillan's play People, Places and Things opened at the National Theatre in a co- production with Headlong Theatre Company in 2015, and was nominated for Best New Play at the Olivier Awards. It transferred to the Wyndham's Theatre in London's West End in 2016 and will transfer to St Ann's Warehouse in New York in 2017. It was directed by Jeremy Herrin and starred Denise Gough, who won the Olivier Award for Best Actress for her performance in 2016. The play is a harrowing look at drug and alcohol addiction and recovery. Its writing was prompted by Macmillan's desire to write a leading part for an actress: he has said he \\"wrote this play believing very strongly that there were a lot of brilliant actresses who just weren't getting parts that would push them and that they could excel in.\\" Gough's performance met with widespread critical acclaim.  Every Brilliant Thing  Every Brilliant Thing was produced by Paines Plough and Pentabus, enjoyed sold-out runs at three consecutive Edinburgh Festivals and continues to tour worldwide. During its run at the Barrow Street Theatre in New York, it was filmed for broadcast on HBO (first aired 2016). It is an interactive monologue, performed with audience participation. Its original performer was the comedian Jonny Donahoe. Macmillan has described his reasons for writing the play as to communicate to people \\"You‚Äôre not alone, you‚Äôre not weird, you will get through it, and you‚Äôve just got to hold on. That‚Äôs a very uncool, unfashionable thing for someone to say, but I really mean it. I didn‚Äôt see anyone discussing suicidal depression in a useful or interesting or accurate way.\\" = 1984 = Macmillan co-adapted and co-directed with Robert Icke a theatrical version of George Orwell's book Nineteen Eighty-Four, a production that has toured the U.K. and Internationally, had three runs in the West End and played on Broadway in the summer of 2017. As co-director with Robert Icke, Macmillan was awarded a UK Theatre Best Director award. = Collaboration with Katie Mitchell = British director Katie Mitchell has directed several of Macmillan's plays. Their collaborations include a play at the Royal Court Theatre entitled 2071, which Macmillan later co-authored as a book on climate science with Professor Chris Rapley. Macmillan's play The Forbidden Zone premiered at the Salzburg Festival before entering the repertoire of the Schaubuehne Berlin and transferring to London's Barbican Theatre. Their collaborations have been invited to Theatertreffen, Festival D'Avignon and awarded the Nestroy Theatre Prize. They also collaborated on the film Unseen, produced by Warp and Film 4. His collaboration with Mitchell led to his meeting Leo Warner, the video designer who directed Macmillan's adaptation of City of Glass in 2017. =Purpose and characteristics= Macmillan has said \\"Most of what I want to say isn‚Äôt particularly coherent; it‚Äôs about trying to find a form to articulate an anxiety or concern I have.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy plays all have some internal contradiction that I can‚Äôt resolve.\\" https://www.jigsaw-online.com/blog/uncategorized/in- conversation-with-playwright-duncan-macmillan.html  References   External links  * Year of birth missing (living people) Living people English dramatists and playwrights Place of birth missing (living people) English screenwriters English male screenwriters English theatre directors ","title":"Duncan Macmillan (playwright)"},{"id":"52801255","text":"Gray Matters is a 2014 documentary film that was written and directed by Marco Orsini.Fifty Shades of Gray (Cultured Digital Magazine 2014) It premiered at the Architecture and Design Film Festival on 15 October 2014 in New York City and received a theatrical release on 28 May 2016.

The city developed as a transit hub and tourist area in the second half of the 19th century, spurred by the construction of a railroad to the area. The district, roughly bounded by Third Street, Coventry Street, and Lake Memphremagog, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The town of Newport, located at the southern end of Lake Memphremagog, was a sleepy agricultural area until 1863, when the Passumpsic Railroad began service. The area then boomed, its economy raised by increases in lumbering and tourism on the lake. In 1918, the central village of the town of Newport was united with the adjacent village of West Derby to form the city of Newport. with The city's main downtown area remains that of the original village, set on a small peninsula jutting eastward into the southernmost finger of the lake. This peninsula was a marshy wilderness until 1820, when it was cleared of timber. A bridge was built from the peninsula to the eastern shore of the lake in 1832, carrying the main road from Derby to Burlington. After the railroad was built through the area in 1863, the stage route became the main downtown area, with hotels, and civic and commercial services. Its regional importance was cemented in the 1880s, when it became the county seat of Orleans County, and the Orleans County Courthouse and Jail Complex was built. The historic district encompasses most of the eastern end of the peninsula housing the city's main business district. The cluster of civic buildings includes, in addition to the courthouse complex, the Federal courthouse, post office and customs house building, the former National Guard armory that now serves as city hall, and the Goodrich Memorial Library, a fine example of Romanesque architecture. There are three churches in the district. Residential architecture in the district often includes broad covered porches, and architectural details of the Victorian and Colonial Revival periods.

It is Buchan's first novel, written when he was nineteen and an undergraduate at Glasgow University. Buchan's original title was Sir Quixote, and he was annoyed by the addition of \\"of the Moors\\" by his publisher. Setting The novel is set in Galloway in Scotland during the Covenanting period (the middle or late seventeenth century). PhD thesis. Preface In an introductory preface, the author explains that the main narrative is supposed to have been written by the Sieur de Rohaine, \\"to while away the time during the long and painful captivity, born with heroic resolution, which preceded his death\\". Both Gutenberg and FadedPage have a corrupted text: ... \\"to while away the time during the long period and painful captivity\\" ... Plot Jean de Rohaine, a French soldier and gentleman in his late 30s, has become impoverished through gaming. Recalling an invitation from an old Scottish friend, Quentin Kennedy, Rohaine travels to Galloway to stay with him. Rohaine enjoys Kennedy's boorish hospitality for a month but longs for some military action. He is pleased when Kennedy asks him to ride out with his dragoons to ‚Äòredd the marches‚Äô [sort out some local issues] on behalf of the King, but is horrified to find that this involves persecuting and butchering the local Covenanting cottagers. He leaves indignantly on horseback, and rides off in bad weather across the moors, becoming lost. Stumbling across a local inn, he stays the night and just manages to escape as he is about to be robbed and murdered by the innkeeper and a band of ruffians. As he continues across the moor his condition worsens and he eventually collapses, ill and exhausted, at the threshold of the manse of Lindean. He is taken in and cared for by Anne, daughter of the elderly minister Ephraim Lambert. She is betrothed to Henry Semple, a young laird also staying there who has been driven from his own nearby estate by the King‚Äôs soldiers. A visitor arrives to warn Lambert and Semple that a warrant has been issued for their arrest after they were spotted at an illegal religious meeting. As arrest will mean almost certain death they need to flee immediately, and their only option is to hide out on the moors. Unable to take Anne with them, and unwilling to leave her unprotected, Semple extracts from a rather unwilling Rohaine his word of honour to remain in the house as her protector until the fugitives can return. As the weeks go by, Anne‚Äôs bearing changes from reserved and sombre to become more open and light- hearted. Rohaine realises that she has fallen in love with him, and he with her, though they never speak of their feelings and he does nothing to betray his position of trust. Rohaine is informed that the authorities know of Lambert and Semple‚Äôs hiding place, and he goes to warn them. Semple comes to the manse, concealing himself from Anne, and tells Rohaine that Lambert is near to death. Semple is wild-eyed, fanatical, and appears to have lost his reason. Rohaine spends a tormented night agonising over the conflict between his desire for Anne and his pledge to protect her for Semple. He ultimately decides that his oath prevents him from declaring his love, and that he must leave. In the morning, as he prepares to depart, she at last openly declares herself, but he is resolute. The novel ends with him riding away: ‚ÄúA fierce north wind met me in the teeth, and piercing through my tatters, sent a shiver to my very heart \\". Unauthorised US ending A pirated version of the book published in the United States significantly changed Buchan's ending by adding without his knowledge an unauthorised final paragraph: PhD thesis. ‚ÄúI cannot recall my thoughts during that ride: I seem not to have thought at all. All I know is that in about an hour there came to my mind, as from a voice, the words: ‚ÄòRecreant! Fool!‚Äô and I turned back.‚Äù It is this unauthorised US version that has been digitised by Project Gutenberg and FadedPage.  Critical reception Although Sir Quixote received little review coverage on publication, what it did receive was generally good. One reviewer noted that Buchan's anachronistic tendency to scrutinise motive \\"lifts the romance far above such ingenious trifling as ... Hope's Prisoner of Zenda\\". David Daniell in The Interpreter's House (1975) stated that while Sir Quixote is \\"an uncomfortable book\\" it is nevertheless \\"a little masterpiece, astonishingly percipient for an adolescent Victorian\\". Daniell perceived a difference between Buchan's \\"literary\\" and \\"observed\\" landscapes, with the former being that of a writer who has read a great deal of French romance, or who has nicely compressed Sir Walter Scott. Buchan's observed Scottish landscape, on the other hand, is quite different: he has seen it, and has brooded on the words for it. Daniell also commended Buchan's understanding of the power of religious experience, forced to a dilemma without solution, the awakening of passion and the loss of innocence; these he considered to be the characteristics of a story by Henry James\\". Writing for the John Buchan Society website, Ronald Hargreaves suggested that the novel exhibits many of the notable features of Buchan's later works, including compelling descriptions, narrative pace, skilful storytelling, and concepts of honour and duty. The idea of the nobility of sacrifice is central, as it would be many years later in Buchan's last work, Sick Heart River.

Early work Hidalgo was born in Santiago de Chile and raised in Winnipeg, Canada. In 1987 he became a fan of the role-playing game (RPG) resources published West End Games, the only official source of Star Wars content in the late 1980s and took it upon himself to become knowledgeable of the universe to create better stories for the group of friends he was playing it with. He later used both content from the RPG and ideas he developed for his gaming sessions within official Star Wars media, such as the tracking device used by the Inquisitor and the name of a ship in Star Wars Rebels. He submitted content for West End Games' Star Wars Adventure Journal in 1993. Although rejected because he was not a published author at the time, his correspondence with the company resulted in him being hired as a cartoonist for the magazine by Peter Schweighofer. Since he was now a published author, he was allowed to publish material for the RPG as well as stories in the magazine. During his involvement, he collected the first large- scale database of Star Wars knowledge, parts of which he posted online in 1997 as the \\"Star Wars Index\\". He also used his extensive knowledge to assist Steve Sansweet with fact-checking the Star Wars Encyclopedia, the first such work published shortly before the release of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Working for Lucasfilm In January 2000 he was hired by Sansweet at Lucasfilm to build up StarWars.com, the official Star Wars website, as a resource for fans during the then-active filming and launch of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. He then served as Internet Content Manager for Lucas Online, the division of Lucasfilm responsible for maintaining StarWars.com, where he also published multiple comics until 2011. Even though Star Wars canon was not completely error-free at this point due to a previous lack of oversight and he was not in any official capacity employed to help maintain it, Hidalgo was already being consulted to ensure continuity during this time. In 2005, he had a non-speaking cameo role in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith as a patron of the opera Chancellor Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker visit. =Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm= After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, he approached Kathleen Kennedy about making his consulting role official which led to the creation of the Lucasfilm Story Group (other members include Kiri Hart and Leland Chee), a group of Star Wars experts tasked with maintaining the canon of the franchise after its partial reboot in 2014. Their duties range from fact-checking dialogue, e.g. whether a certain character would really say a certain line or whether it makes sense in the universe's context, to keeping track of names and locations of planets as well as naming unnamed planets, characters and other entities as well as coordinating all stories in development. Sometimes called the Yoda of Lucasfilm or \\"the Indiana Jones of Star Wars\\", his insider knowledge of Star Wars canon is used by multiple sources to confirm or deny rumors about certain characters, locations or events within the fictional universe. J.J. Abrams admitted that during the production of Star Wars: The Force Awakens he often e-mailed Hidalgo up to three times a day asking him questions about details about the franchise's universe.

History  The centre began as a boarding school in a rented municipal building in Manresa, which was evacuated after a misunderstanding between the Council and the Jesuits. In 1892 the Jesuits bought the Gardeny property, consisting of a house and extensive gardens. An annex was built and classes began the same year. The current building was built between 1893 and 1896, and opened in 1895 unfinished (completed between 1915 and 1926). It was originally a boarding school but began admitting external students in 1905. In 1907 it had 20 teachers and 230 students, mostly boarders. The school was closed in 1914 so that the facility could accommodate the Jesuit houses of philosophical and theological studies for the priesthood, but it reopened in 1927. During the Second Republic as a result of the decree of expulsion of the Jesuits, the Government made it a public school until the end of the Civil War.

Indo-Surinamese form the largest ethnic group in Suriname, making 27.4% of the population. The current Vice-President of Suriname Ashwin Adhin is of Indo-Surinamese descent. History India and Suriname established diplomatic relations in 1976. India opened its embassy in Paramaribo in 1977, and Suriname opened its embassy in New Delhi in 2000. Suriname also has an honorary consul in Bangalore. The Suriname-India Joint Commission to strengthen cooperation between the public and private sectors of both countries was established in September 1992. Since 1998, Suriname has supported India's candidature for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council. Suriname President R.R. Venetiaan visited India from 16‚Äì20 March 2003. During the visit, Venetiaan met with Indian President A.P.J. Kalam and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and the two countries signed agreements on co-operation in agriculture, establishment of a Cultural Exchange Programme (CEP) and the extension of $10 million line of credit from India to Suriname. Since 1 March 2016, Indian citizens can avail visa on arrival when visiting Suriname. Economic relations Bilateral trade between India and Suriname totaled US$228.49 million in 2014-15. The main commodities exported from India to Suriname are boilers, machinery, iron and steel, electrical machinery and equipment, sound recorders, pharmaceutical products, textiles, vehicles, coffee, tea and spices, rubber, paper, tobacco, organic chemicals, furniture, carpets, ceramic products, footwear and printed books. The main commodities exported from Suriname to India are wood, aluminum and electrical machinery. Indian foreign aid India has extended multiple lines of credit (LOC) to Suriname. In 1992, the first LOC provided . An LOC extended worth US$10 million extended in 2003 was utilized to renovate water pumping stations, establish a steel rolling mill and for supply of 14 heavy hydraulic excavators. A third LOC granted $16 million to the Suriname Electricity Board to construct a 161 KV, 55 km-long power transmission line from Paranam to Paramaribo. India also supplied bulldozers, trucks, excavators, communication equipment and solar lanterns to Suriname. A fourth LOC worth $10.4 million was granted to the Ministry of Public Works of Suriname to complete establish pumping stations. Other LOCs include a US$4.3 million grant of fire tenders manufactured by BEML India, and coastal equipment network worth $2.946 million from BEL. In March 2015, India transferred 3 HAL Chetak helicopters worth $13.5 million to the Surinamese military. A grant of $311,567 was provided to upgrade the morgue of the Lands Hospital in Paramaribo, and sum $169,400 was donated to the Institute for Natural Resources and Engineering Studies (NATIN) of Suriname under India's Grant-in-Aid to Latin American and Caribbean region programme. India announced a $50 million grant of aid to Suriname at 5th Joint Commission meeting between the two countries. Citizens of Suriname are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.

Just before and following the independence of Suriname on 25 November 1975, many Indo-Surinamese emigrated to the Netherlands, resulting in a decline in the population of the Indian community in Suriname. During the British Raj, many Indians were sent to other British colonies for work. After the abolition of slavery in the Dutch colony of Suriname, the Dutch government signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers. Indians began migrating to Suriname in 1873 as indentured labourers, mostly from the modern-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and the surrounding regions. Due to the presence of a large Indian-origin community in Suriname, nearly 400 applications for Overseas Citizenship of India are made by Surinamese citizens every year.  Vice President Adhin of Suriname  = Foreign policy =  Relations with India  On January 9, 2017, Vice President Ashwin Adhin met with the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, in Bengaluru, India, where they discussed strengthening the economic and technological bilateral cooperation between both states. Adhin emphasized that Suriname has a lot to of potential in the areas of agriculture, animal husbandry, palm oil, wood processing, besides those in the extractive industries (gold, crude oil and bauxite). Adhin's plans are to set up a chair on Ayurveda at the University of Suriname and National Institute for Natural and Holistic Therapies in collaboration with India. His plans include setting up medicinal plantations, research laboratories, factories to manufacture Ayurveda products for the Surinamese market and expanding to also cover the Latin American countries and Caribbean Islands . This vision of Adhin supports efforts to diversify the Surinamese economy but also the governments approach to make healthcare the most important priority. This latter is also emphasized by the Governments Health in All Policies (HIAP) programme. As a young accomplished individual of Indian origin, Adhin was invited to India as keynote speaker at the Youth Privasi Bharatiya Divas Convention held on January 7, 2016, which was part of the annual Privasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) Convention, a global platform for Indian Diaspora held from 8‚Äì9 January 2017 in Bengaluru, the capital of the state of Karnataka.

The shooting occurred following an attempt by the officer to stop and question a bicyclist riding near the Wayne State University campus in an area which was experiencing an increase in thefts. The bicyclist was arrested and charged, but later released due to lack of evidence. Rose, who was shot in the head, died the following day at 5:45 p.m. at Detroit Receiving Hospital. He was surrounded by his family and close friends while his co- workers and fellow law enforcement waited in the hospital lobby. Rose was the first Wayne State University Police Department officer to die in the line of duty. Rose was the fifth police officer shot in the United States within three days.  Event  At 6:31 p.m. ET on Tuesday, November 22, 2016, Rose radioed into dispatch requesting backup and saying he was approaching a bicyclist. Arriving back-up officers found Rose on the ground and with a gunshot wound to the head. The officers loaded Rose into the back of a patrol car and rushed him to Detroit Receiving Hospital, where he was taken into surgery. Shortly after, the bicyclist was named a person of interest in the shooting. They were taken into custody at approximately 9:45 p.m., following a search involving multiple police agencies and helicopters. Following surgery, Rose was on a ventilator and listed as being in a critical, but stable, condition. However, he died from his injuries the following day, November 23, at approximately 5:35 p.m. at Detroit Receiving Hospital. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by family and friends. More than 150 other police officers stood vigil in the lobby.  Victim  Collin James Rose (April 1, 1987 ‚Äì November 23, 2016) was a police officer who specialized in working with police dogs, posthumously promoted to Sergeant, with the Wayne State University Police Department at Wayne State University.

In 2013 he traveled to Boston for the funeral of Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Officer Sean Collier. In 2014 he traveled to Scranton, Penn. for the funeral of Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Bryon Dickson. Rose rode in the Police Unity Tour beginning in 2015. He had just started fundraising with his teammate in early November. He was slated to ride again in May 2017.

He was also a member of the Metro Detroit Schutzhund Club, which trains dogs using the Schutzhund method. He was a resident of St. Clair Shores, Michigan, and attended the city's St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church. Rose was engaged to be married in October 2017. At the time of his death, his fianc√©e worked with Detroit Dog Rescue, a local animal rescue group. Rose was pursuing a master's degree in dispute resolution and was one class away from completion. He had volunteered at the Wayne Mediation Center in Dearborn. Following his death, Wayne State University President M. Roy Wilson announced he would be receiving his master's degrees posthumously at the university's next commencement ceremony. He was 29 years old when he died. While two other Wayne State officers have been shot in the line of duty since the department's formation in 1966, Rose was the first line of duty death. He was the third police officer who worked in Detroit to die in the line of duty since September 2016, and the fifth police officer shot in the United States within three days. A viewing and memorial for Rose was held at Ford Field on November 29, 2016. His funeral was held at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church in St. Clair Shores on December 1, 2016.  Investigation  The bicyclist Rose was pursuing, who was taken into custody soon after the shooting, was charged with first-degree murder, murder of a police officer, being a felon in possession of a firearm, three felony firearm charges, and being a habitual offender. However, the charges were dropped on December 7, 2016. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced the person was no longer a suspect. Police also announced they were continuing their search for suspects. On March 15, 2017 two Detroit Police Department officers were shot and wounded after stopping to question a man, Raymond Durham, who was walking in the street near Tillman and Ash. The Third Precinct officers who were shot exchanged gunfire with Durham, striking him in the leg and arm. They were transported to Detroit Receiving Hospital by responding officers and admitted with non-life-threatening injuries. Responding officers established a perimeter and located Durham hiding near Michigan and Vinewood. Durham was transported to Henry Ford Hospital for treatment of his gunshot wounds. A sample of his DNA was submitted to the state police forensic science laboratory to check against the trace evidence left at the scene where Rose was shot. The investigation is still ongoing in both shootings, but it is believed that Durham is in fact the person who shot and killed Collin Rose. Durham was arraigned on the shooting of the Third Precinct officers and pending initial court proceedings. The murder investigation continues, but Detroit Police Chief James Craig said during a press conference on March 17 that scientists found a \\"positive DNA match between Durham and the suspect in Rose's murder.\\" Chief Craig also added, \\"We are calling him (Durham) a suspect in this matter, so that is a big first step\\".http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/raymond-durham-arraigned-on-charges- in-shooting-of-2-detroit-police-officers_ On August 3, 2017 at 2 p.m. a press conference was held at the Wayne State University Police Department. Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced her office had charged Raymond Durham with first degree premeditated murder, murder of a peace officer, possession of a firearm by a felon and two counts of felony firearm. \\"It's taken eight months of hard, diligent work to bring these charges,\\" Worthy said. Wayne State Police Chief Anthony Holt and Detroit Police Chief James Craig were on hand for the announcement. \\"This will bring a sense of closure to the family, our officers and the Wayne State University community at large,\\" Holt said. \\"This is a solemn time, not one of celebration, as our department is still recovering, but it does provide some comfort.\\" Craig reminded the public that officers are still recovering from the March shooting and said \\"I am hopeful the (murder) charge will send a strong message to anyone who would harm our officers.\\" At 3:20 p.m. Raymond Durham appeared before 36th District Court Judge Kenneth King for a competency hearing for the March shooting of Detroit Police Officers James Kisselburg and Ben Atkinson. A review was heard and Durham remains incompetent to stand trial. The matter was scheduled for a review on November 3. Immediately after the hearing, Durham was arraigned on the murder charges. Randy and Karen Rose were present along with Detroit Police Homicide Sgt. Lance Sullivan, Wayne State University Police Captain Patrick Saunders and Officers Chris Powell and Patrick Cecile. Durham was ordered back to the Center for Forensic Psychiatry, a 210-bed psychiatric facility that provides diagnostic services to the criminal justice system and psychiatric treatment for criminal defendants adjudicated incompetent to stand trial or acquitted by not guilty by reason of insanity.  Reactions and legacy Michigan Governor Rick Snyder released a statement while Rose was still in critical condition which in part said, \\"Our police officers need our support and appreciation. This recent wave of violence against those sworn to protect and serve must end. Let's hope Officer Rose can make a full recovery and let's never forget the sacrifice he has made in service to his state.\\" He also ordered for all United States and Michigan flags to be lowered to half- staff on all State of Michigan government buildings on December 2, 2016. Wayne State University Police Chief Anthony Holt said Rose was \\"one of the best canine handlers not only in the state, but probably in the country.\\" Wayne State University President M. Roy Wilson said \\"This is a tragedy felt by all of us.\\" He added that Collin served Wayne State with distinction, and we owe those he left behind our deepest sympathies and our strong support.\\" Ferris State University President David Eisler said in a statement, \\"Officer Rose was an excellent student, a leader among his peers and a consummate professional dedicated to protecting and serving.\\" More than 200 people attended a candlelight vigil held for Rose in Scripps Park, a Detroit park near where the shooting occurred, on Saturday, November 26, 2016. A viewing and memorial for Rose was held at Ford Field on November 29, 2016. Hundreds of police officers, family, friends, and community members lined up in the stadium's atrium to view his casket. Mourners gathered for a candlelight vigil on Wayne State University's campus on November 29 and bowed their head in a moment of silence at 6:31 p.m., exactly one week after Rose radioed in his request for backup. During the event, Chief Holt posthumously promoted Rose to Sergeant, and awarded him the Citation of Valor ‚Äî the highest award issued by the department. Only three other officers have received the award since the department was created. Wayne State University President Wilson also announced the creation of a 25,000 scholarship in Rose's name. Wayne State University posthumously awarded Rose his master's degree in dispute resolution during commencement ceremonies. The village of Richland, Michigan placed a memorial marker beneath a newly planted tree on December 8, 2016. The Detroit Tigers held a winter caravan ceremony at Wayne State University Police Department on January 20, 2017 honoring Rose and cobringing attention to the request for information in the investigation of the shooting. On July 17, 2017 the Officer Collin Rose Memorial Foundation was incorporated by some of Rose's friends. The organization was created to ensure the fallen hero is never forgotten. Accordingly they sought to further Officer Rose's legacy by providing assistance in the following areas: Support of the Wayne State University Police Department canine and honor guard teams, Support of participants in the annual Police Unity Tour memorial bicycle ride, Support of the First Responders: Sergeant Collin J. Rose Memorial Scholarship at Gull Lake Community Schools Foundation, Support of nonprofit canine safety organizations, animal welfare organizations and the Collin Rose Enrichment Center at Detroit Dog Rescue Emotional and financial support of fellow Line of Duty Death survivors.

In addition to the support of the scale, there are further large flour sacks with trademarks. About 1551. A flour sack, feed sack, or flour bag is a cloth sack, usually made of cheap cotton, used to store flour or animal feed. Flour sacks are often printed with simple designs and trademarks to indicate the millers and companies making or selling the flour. Many regions of the world reuse the sacks to produce clothing and household linens. Place names Various place names were named after flour sacks, since they were so ubiquitous in so many cultures. Blatobulgium in Scotland, and Pieniƒô≈ºno in Poland, for example, are possibly named after words for flour sack in different languages. The all-white tower in the old city of Ravensburg in Germany is called Mehlsack. Reuel Colt Gridley A photo of Reuel Colt Gridley, who became famous in the United States in 1864 by repeatedly selling a sack of flour to raise money for the \\"Sanitary Fund\\" (to help wounded U.S. Civil War veterans). This picture was reportedly published in Harper's Weekly in 1865. Reuel Colt Gridley famously carried a 50-pound bag of flour on his shoulder after losing a political bet in Austin, Nevada. The sack of flour was later auctioned off, then re-donated, then re-auctioned again and again to raise money for the United States Sanitary Commission during the American Civil War. Auctioning this single flour sack eventually raised more than $250,000. Clothing alt=Feedsack dress Children's clothing made from the Near East relief flour sacks worn by Armenian refugees in Syria, 1915.Because they came along with the purchase of essential flour, flour sacks were universally recycled and used by many cultures as a source of free textiles for clothing and other necessities. For refugees, the free cloth that came with flour helped replace worn-out and inadequate clothing. = In the US = By the middle of the 19th century in the US, the economies of shipping commodities such as animal feeds, seeds, sugar and flour became more cost- effective to package and ship in sacks rather than in barrels, which was what had been previously used. By the late 19th century, flour sacks were often printed in various colors and designs, and recycled for clothing and other purposes. Farm women recycled the sacks into clothing, and by 1925 at least one company, Gingham Girl, was packaging in dress-quality fabrics and using their sacks as a selling point. By the 1930s companies regarded the sacks as a crucial part of marketing product. One feed store owner complained about purchase decisions moving from the farmer to the farmwife, saying \\"Years ago they used to ask for all sorts of feeds. Now they come over and ask me if I have an egg mash in a flowered percale. It ain‚Äôt natural.‚Äù During the Great Depression in the US, many families sewed clothing from discarded flour sacks.

The sacks had so many uses, and the clothing made from them was so common, that flour sacks entered the local folklore. Kendra Brandes found that \\"as an element of material culture, the clothing and clothing practices of rural populations reflect the life and times of the era to the same extent as that of the general population. However, it is the activities of these farm wives, clothing their families in feed sacks, that offer a view of life that was unique to rural communities during this time period.\\" Several people from rural Virginia spoke about their clothes made from sacks during the depression. \\"Back then, feed was sold in sacks. I believe they held almost 100 pounds of seeds. A number of farmers who didn't sew returned the sacks for resale...

It was chartered in 1881 by a consortium of Mexican and American investors including former President Ulysses S. Grant. Construction delays plagued the company and by 1885, it was bankrupt. Under new ownership, construction was completed in 1892. The line became profitable for its owners until nationalized in 1936. Investors The idea for the Mexican Southern sprang from discussions between former United States President Ulysses S. Grant and Mexican politician Mat√≠as Romero. Romero and Grant had been friends since the late 1860s, when Romero represented Mexico as ambassador to the United States while Grant was serving as commanding general in Washington. Grant had been interested in Mexico since his service there in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in the 1840s. While there, Grant had developed a sympathy for the Mexican people and later supported their rebellion against Emperor Maximilian, the foreign prince installed by French troops while the United States was fighting its Civil War. After leaving office, Grant visited Mexico in 1880 before attempting to be nominated for a third term as President. When that effort failed, he turned his attention to building a post-presidential career in business. Romero was also focused on business, and especially with the idea of attracting foreign investment to Mexico. After seeing the success of the Sonora Railway Company in doing so in 1879, he turned his attention to railroads and Grant. Even before the 1880 Republican National Convention, Romero approached Grant about railway promotion. That October, with Grant's political chances foreclosed, Romero visited him in the United States and offered him the presidency of a potential railroad, which he hoped to build south from Mexico City to the Guatemala border. The governor of the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca granted Romero a concession to build there. Romero and Grant held a banquet at Delmonico's in New York City to pitch the idea to wealthy American investors. That winter, they worked to convince the New York state legislature to incorporate the venture, which they did on March 1, 1881. Grant served as president of the new company, with Union Pacific executive Grenville Dodge as vice president and Russell Sage, another railroad man, as treasurer. Construction and operation Grant and Romero left for Mexico City later that month. After lobbying the government there for two months, they received permission to construct the railroad, and Grant returned to the United States. The Mexican government's terms included no subsidy and required construction to be complete in ten years. Because of its prominent president, the new venture received a great deal of attention in the American press. Harper's Magazine published an article about it describing the company and its aims: The investors' ambition exceeded even that description, as Grant obtained a concession from the Guatemalan government to continue the railroad a further 250 miles into that country. At the same time, Grant joined American President Chester A. Arthur in lobbying Congress to approve a free- trade agreement with Mexico, which they declined to do. Meanwhile, surveying of the Mexican Southern's route continued slowly and by 1883 construction had barely begun. In 1884, the company ran out of money and the northern segment was placed in receivership. The southern segment followed in 1885 with the failure of Grant's other business interests in New York, and the Mexican government declared the charter forfeit. Grant died later that same year. The Mexican government awarded the Mexican Southern's former charter to Governor Luis Mier y Ter√°n in 1886, but the company was quickly bankrupt again. A British company, Read and Campbell, acquired the company in 1888 and, at last, began construction. The company by then had limited its ambitions to that of a regional railway and only planned to build from Puebla to Oaxaca. Beginning in Puebla, the line reached Tehuac√°n in January 1891. It reached the Tomell√≠n Canyon later that year. Construction reached Oaxaca City and was complete in November 1892. Mexican President Porfirio D√≠az presided over the opening day ceremonies. Two short branches were later constructed out of Oaxaca. The company also acquired a tram line between Tehuac√°n and Esperanza. The railroad was successful enough to pay dividends between 1897 and 1914. There was soon enough commerce on the line to require the company to borrow train cars from nearby railroads. Proposals to extend the road to Tehuantepec were raised from time to time, but never executed. In 1909, the Interoceanic Railway of Mexico obtained a lease of the Mexican Southern. The Interoceanic, a division of the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico, was nationalized in 1936. Mexico privatized the railroads again in 1995, but nearly all passenger rail service, including the Puebla-Oaxaca stretch of line, has been suspended since 1997.

Directed by Emmanuel Q. Palo and Jon S. Villarin, the series stars Royal Princess of Drama Julia Montes in a dual role, as Kara Dela Rosa and Sara Suarez, together with an ensemble cast consisting of Carmina Villarroel, Mylene Dizon, Ariel Rivera, Allen Dizon, Alicia Alonzo, Edgar Allan Guzman, and John Lapus. The first season of Doble Kara chronicles the lives of identical twin sisters Kara Dela Rosa and Sara Suarez and how identity, wealth, deceit, and manipulation test their bond as sisters. In addition, the first season also revolves around the twins' parents and also how Sara, desperate to gain her biological father's, Antonio Dela Rosa, affection, pretends to be Kara in front of him and his wife, Lucille Dela Rosa. While pretending in front of Lucille and Antonio, Sara becomes more scheming and materialistic, vowing to make life better for herself, and also attempting to gain Edward, her love interest's, affection while also trying to make Kara's life miserable, as punishment for all of her lies.  Plot  Doble Kara began with the story of a poverty-stricken Laura (Mylene Dizon) who had no means of acquiring money for her dying mother Esme's (Irma Adlawan) medical treatment. Laura, who had no choice but resort to prostitution, was impregnated by a married man named Antonio Dela Rosa (Allen Dizon). Despite what happened, Ishmael (Ariel Rivera) who has shown Laura true love, marries her, and steps in as the father of her two unborn children. On the same day of Laura's childbearing, Lucille (Carmina Villarroel), Antonio's wife, too, also gives birth to their child, Sofia. However, the couple's daughter died shortly after delivery in consequence of her premature birth. As Antonio and Lucille mourn their daughter's early passing, Laura and Ishmael, together with godmother Itoy (John Lapus) and his brother Andy (Harvey Bautista/Anjo Damiles) enjoyed and lived a happy life with their twin daughters, Kara and Sara (Avery Balasbas), regardless of being poor. The twins' differences become apparent when Kara excels in academics while Sara struggles, thus made Sara switch identities with Kara to make her pass her academics. However, when Kara was diagnosed with leukemia, Sara became jealous of the extra attention that was given to her sister. With limited means, their parents were forced to separate the two and give up Kara to her biological father Antonio, who had the means to provide better treatment for her disease. With Kara finally aware of her true origins, Laura and Ishmael decided to keep their secret from Antonio, in fear of losing Sara as well. Antonio brings Kara unto the Dela Rosa Foundation where she meets Lucille. Disheartened by Kara's ailment, Lucille began to espouse a mother-daughter relationship with Kara as she began to consider her as her own daughter with the previous loss of Sofia. Unbeknownst to her of the existing relationship between her husband and Kara, Lucille adopts and brings Kara abroad where she recovers from her illness. The two siblings, despite sharing the same appearance, grew up living two separate lives and contrasting personalities. Sara, who has an extreme fondness of beauty contests and pageants, grew up ambitiously towards her own life and dream, becoming more self-centered and egoistic while fostering a street-smart attitude. While Kara grew up to be charming, sweet, mellow, very sophisticated, and artistically inclined. After fourteen years had passed, a grown-up Kara (Julia Montes) returns to her hometown and, against her father's wishes, resolves to find her family. On the other hand, unaware of her sister's whereabouts, Sara (Julia Montes) continued to pursue her dream of becoming rich and famous, and meets Edward (Edgar Allan Guzman). The two became a sweet couple but as days test their relationship, they stop themselves in impoverishment so they broke up and remained friends. In the meantime, after several attempts, Kara had finally succeeded to meet her twin sister Sara in one of Edward's concert. Kara pleaded with Sara not to tell their parents yet of her return in order to avoid further complications in her family. Amidst of these, Laura and Ishmael soon discovered of Kara's presence when Kara worriedly visited her mother who got admitted in a hospital because of ulcer and when Ishmael got victimized in a taxi hold-up. Several situations had occurred in keeping Kara and Antonio's secret including Sara who got mistaken for as Kara by Lucille and Antonio. This accidental switching of identities later gave Sara the acquisitiveness to share Kara's luxurious life, much to Kara's detriment. Meanwhile, Sara's jealousy towards Kara heightens as she unraveled her true origins ‚Äì kept hidden by her own parents and sister. Now aware of her true identity, Sara started to yearn for Antonio's affections and used her sister's identity to get closer to her real father, but eventually the truth was revealed to Antonio that he actually shared twins with Laura.

AlexNet competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge on September 30, 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the runner up. The original paper's primary result was that the depth of the model was essential for its high performance, which was computationally expensive, but made feasible due to the utilization of graphics processing units (GPUs) during training.  Historic context  AlexNet was not the first fast GPU- implementation of a CNN to win an image recognition contest. A CNN on GPU by K. Chellapilla et al. (2006) was 4 times faster than an equivalent implementation on CPU. A deep CNN of Dan Cire»ôan et al. (2011) at IDSIA was already 60 times faster and achieved superhuman performance in August 2011. Between May 15, 2011 and September 10, 2012, their CNN won no fewer than four image competitions. They also significantly improved on the best performance in the literature for multiple image databases. According to the AlexNet paper, Cire»ôan's earlier net is \\"somewhat similar.\\" Both were originally written with CUDA to run with GPU support. In fact, both are actually just variants of the CNN designs introduced by Yann LeCun et al. (1989) who applied the backpropagation algorithm to a variant of Kunihiko Fukushima's original CNN architecture called \\"neocognitron.\\" The architecture was later modified by J. Weng's method called max-pooling. In 2015, AlexNet was outperformed by Microsoft Research Asia's very deep CNN with over 100 layers, which won the ImageNet 2015 contest.  Network design  AlexNet contained eight layers; the first five were convolutional layers, some of them followed by max-pooling layers, and the last three were fully connected layers. It used the non- saturating ReLU activation function, which showed improved training performance over tanh and sigmoid.  Influence  AlexNet is considered one of the most influential papers published in computer vision, having spurred many more papers published employing CNNs and GPUs to accelerate deep learning. , the AlexNet paper has been cited over 61,000 times.  Alex Krizhevsky  Alex Krizhevsky (born in Ukraine, raised in Canada) is a computer scientist most noted for his work on artificial neural networks and deep learning. Shortly after having won the ImageNet challenge 2012 through AlexNet, he and his colleagues sold their startup DNN Research Inc. to Google. Krizhevsky left Google in September 2017 when he lost interest in the work. At the company Dessa, Krizhevsky will advise and help research new deep-learning techniques.

It allowed military gliders to be launched from a stationary position on the ground by a low- flying powered aircraft (the tow or tug), flying low overhead, which did not have to land. The snatching aircraft, typically a Douglas C-47 Skytrain (\\"Dakota\\"), had a 20 ft arm hanging down at a 45-degree angle, supporting a hook at the tip. The hook was attached to a steel rope attached to an automatic winch, containing 1000 ft of steel cable. On flyover, the hook engaged in a square-shaped loop of nylon tow rope, supported on two poles about 20 ft apart and 10 ft off the ground. This loop was attached to a 180 ft nylon tow rope attached to the front of the glider. The special design of the hook meant it was less likely to snag the ground but would grab the loop. When the hook engaged in the loop, the rope initially paid out from the winch, and then gradually a brake was automatically applied until up to 800 ft of cable had been paid out. This, and the stretch in the nylon rope, reduced shock loading to less than 1 g for a duration of around 3 to 6 seconds, by which time the glider would be airborne. The steel wire was then winched in. It was possible for one plane to pick up two gliders in this way, in two passes. Gliders could be retrieved for re-use in this way after combat operations. Some casualties were evacuated from the D-Day landings back to the United Kingdom using this technique. Several rescues of downed aircraft passengers were also performed by landing gliders to pick up survivors and then snatching them from remote locations. https://www.mylubbock.us/docs/silent-wings-museum- file-library/retrievalsystem.pdf?sfvrsn=2 Also see *1945 New Guinea Gremlin Special rescue  References  Military gliders Airborne warfare ","title":"Glider snatch pick-up technique"},{"id":"52802012","text":"The 1980 Men's Hockey Champions Trophy was the 2nd edition of the Hockey Champions Trophy, an international men's field hockey tournament.

Ports operated by the Kriegsmarine were divided into two classes - major and minor. For most major ports, a port commander (Hafenkommandanten) was the senior most officer in charge of the port. Ports in the same geographical area were grouped together under administrative units known as Hafenkommandanten im Bereich. Vessels assigned within German ports were organized into harbor defense flotillas. Smaller ports were overseen by \\"Port captains\\" (Hafenkapit√§ne); however, in some larger ports this title was also used for the port commander. Both major and minor port commanders reported to a naval area commander (Der Kommandant im Abschnitt), who in turn administratively reported to a Navy district commander.Lohmann W. & Hildebrand H., Die Deutsche Kriegsmarine, Verlag Hans-Henning Podzun, Bad Nauheim (1956) For operational military defense, ports were also assigned to one of several sea defense zones. Major German Ports For major ports within Germany, a position of \\"Naval Superintendent\\" (Marineintendantur) served as the port commander and answered directly to the commanders of the Navy regions. Naval superintendent positions established during World War II included Bremen, Wilhelmshaven, Kiel, and Hamburg. The superintendent at Kiel also possessed a deputy port captain. Naval superintendents were allocated a staff of various department heads to oversee activities in the various German ports. These include a building superintendent (Marine-Baudirektion), naval arsenal (Kriegsmarinearsenal), personnel office (Kriegsmarinedienststelle), and communications unit (Marinenachrichtenabteilung). The larger German ports also typically maintained a naval brig (Prisenhof).

The work was commissioned for the pianist Emanuel Ax by the New York Philharmonic, the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, and the Tonhalle Orchester Z√ºrich. It was composed from 2014 through 2016 and was given its world premiere by Emanuel Ax and the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Alan Gilbert at David Geffen Hall on January 5, 2017. Composition =Background= The concerto mixes the styles of cabaret music into the traditional orchestral setting. Gruber first conceived the piece while composing the nightclub scene for his 2014 opera Tales from the Vienna Woods. In the score program notes, he wrote, \\"I was intrigued how the 'shimmy' music played by the cabaret band is itself simple and emotionless, but forms an effective counterpoint to the powerful drama in the foreground. This was the bud from which my concerto grew.\\" =Structure= The concerto has a duration of roughly 23 minutes and is cast in one continuous movement. In the score program notes, Gruber described the composition as \\"progressing through a chain of developing variations,\\" which \\"is closest in form to a Sinfonietta with piano solo.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a solo piano and a large orchestra comprising two flutes (one doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, bass clarinet (doubling clarinet), alto saxophone, soprano saxophone (doubling tenor saxophone), three bassoons (one doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, celeste (doubling keyboard glockenspiel), harp, and strings. Reception The music critic Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times described the piece as \\"an intricate and provocative score\\" and \\"a 24-minute single-movement concerto that unfolds with inexorable sweep and rhythmic persistence, even during some stream-of- consciousness stretches.\\" He further wrote: David Wright of the New York Classical Review similarly lauded the piece's \\"glittering, Gershwin-like piano syncopations and lush orchestral sonorities √† la Rachmaninoff.\\" Conversely, Jay Nordlinger of The New Criterion was more critical of the work, remarking, \\"I think the Gruber Piano Concerto is a piece that interested and amused the composer, in his own head. That is important. Did it interest and amuse me? Not especially. I admired the work‚Äîit is done by a craftsman, and a genuine spirit‚Äîbut I found it tedious. It seemed to me more an exercise in preparation for a real piece than the piece itself.\\" References Compositions by Heinz Karl Gruber 2016 compositions Gruber, Heinz Music commissioned by the Berlin Philharmonic Music commissioned by the New York Philharmonic Music commissioned by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra ","title":"Piano Concerto (Gruber)"},{"id":"52802256","text":"Connolly Barracks () is a military installation in Longford, Ireland.

Professional career Coming out of West Virginia, Douglas was projected to be a third to fifth round pick from the majority of NFL draft experts and analysts. He received an invitation to the NFL combine and completed all of the required combine and positional drills. On March 31, 2017, Douglas participated at West Virginia's pro day and opted to run the 40, 20, and 10-yard dash once again while also performing positional drills. Team representatives and scouts from all 32 NFL teams attended to scout Douglas, K. J. Dillon, Shelton Gibson, Tyler Orlosky, and 14 other prospects. He was ranked the 19th best cornerback prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. =Philadelphia Eagles= The Philadelphia Eagles selected Douglas in the third round (99th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was the 17th cornerback selected in the draft and the second cornerback taken by the Eagles after they selected Sidney Jones in the second round (42nd overall). He competed with Patrick Robinson, Jalen Mills, Ron Brooks, Ronald Darby, Jaylen Watkins, Aaron Grymes, and Sidney Jones throughout training camp for the starting cornerback position. Head coach Doug Pederson named him the fourth cornerback on the Eagles' depth chart to start the regular season, behind Ronald Darby, Jalen Mills, and Patrick Robinson. Douglas was inactive for the Philadelphia Eagles' season-opening 30-17 victory over the Washington Redskins. During the second quarter, starting cornerback Ronald Darby dislocated his ankle, sidelining him for 4‚Äì6 weeks.

Her best known work is Il mondo degli Etruschi (The World of the Etruscans). First published in 1960 and translated into several languages, it influenced scholarly opinion for many years and became a classic text. Early life and education Luisa Banti was born into a well-to-do family in Florence in 1894, the oldest of six children. Her father, Guido Banti, was a prominent physician and Professor of Pathology at the University of Florence. Having inherited her father's propensity for analytical research, she defied expectations for women of her day by enrolling in the University of Florence when she was in her thirties, to study philology and classical antiquity. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on the Luni site and her post-doctoral thesis on the cult of the dead in archaic Rome. Among her professors were Giacomo Devoto, who introduced her to Etruscology, and Luigi Pernier, who trained her in Etruscan archaeology. Career Banti's earliest published research papers were on historical topography. In the 1930s she spent summers with the Italian Archaeological Mission at Crete, where she organized and wrote about artifacts discovered earlier at Festos and Haghia Triada. After publishing several articles on Minoan religion, she was appointed to the History of Religions Department at the University of Rome. In the 1940s she also served as editorial assistant for the journal Bolletino d'Arte, and wrote book reviews for Studi Etruschi and Athenaeum. Banti chaired the Department of Archaeology and History of Greek and Roman Art at the University of Pavia from 1948 to 1950, and the Department of Etruscan Studies and Italic Archaeology at the University of Florence from 1950 to 1965. During this period she also lectured at American universities, including Columbia and Princeton. From 1965 to 1972 she presided over L'Istituto di Studi Etruschi (the Institute for Etruscan Studies). In 1960, Banti published the first edition of what would become her best known work, Il mondo degli Etruschi (The World of the Etruscans). A second edition was published in 1968, and the first English translation, The Etruscan Cities and Their Culture, was published by the University of California in 1973. Although primarily a technical archaeological report, the book provided the best overview of Etruscan art available at the time. It influenced scholarly opinion for many years and became a classic text. Banti spent her final years at the American Academy in Rome studying the villa at Hagia Triada. She died in 1978, bequeathing her library of some 930 volumes to the University of Florence.

Nagle led high-profile inquiries into the NSW Department of Corrective Services and the assassination of political candidate Donald Mackay.  Early life  Born on 10 July 1913, Nagle was the second of nine children. His father, Valentine Flood Nagle, was a solicitor in Albury. Nagle entered the University of Sydney at age 15, completing an arts degree in 1932. Four years later, he completed a law degree, allowing him to follow in the footsteps of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather, all lawyers. A few months after Nagle was admitted to the bar, Australia declared war on Germany. Nagle enlisted and served in the 2/5th Field Regiment, seeing action in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. Following Japan's entry into the war, the regiment was deployed to the South Pacific, where Nagle served as a paratrooper. By the war's end, he had risen to the rank of major and was second-in-command of his battalion. In 1944 he married Stephanie Mary Gilronan Scott and they had one child, Winsome. The marriage ended in 1950. An avid sportsman, Nagle represented the Riverina district in rugby and Jaguar in the Monte Carlo Rally.  Legal career  Following the war, Nagle returned to legal practice. Among his contemporaries in Sydney's legal fraternity were future Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and future Governor- General Sir William Deane. In 1960, Nagle was appointed to the State's Supreme Court by the Heffron Labor Government, just a year after taking silk. Nagle enjoyed the respect of politicians on both sides, however, and was selected by the Willis Liberal Government to head a royal commission into the State's troubled prison system in 1976. Two months later, with the Liberals out of office, newly-elected Labor Premier Neville Wran removed the two other members of the commission, leaving Nagle to preside alone. Nagle handed down his report in March 1978. Its 630 pages excoriated \\"an inefficient Department administering antiquated and disgraceful gaols; untrained and sometimes ignorant prison officers, resentful, intransigent and incapable of performing their tasks.\\" The first of its 252 recommendations was the sacking of Commissioner of Corrective Services Walter McGeechan ‚Äì though the Government dismissed McGeechan shortly before receiving Nagle's final report. Nagle's report was influential well beyond his home State: Tony Vinson, who took over the Department from McGeechan, later observed that leading prison administrators the world over \\"invariably know of and allude to the Nagle Report as an important benchmark.\\" Nagle was promoted to chief judge at common law in 1979 and retired from the bench in 1983.  Later life  Nagle retired to his 700-hectare sheep and cattle property outside of Albury. Three years later, the Government recalled him to head up a special commission of inquiry into the police's handling of the assassination of Donald Mackay. Nagle's report criticised both the lead investigator, Joe Parrington, and former federal Labor minister Al Grassby. In 1995, Nagle published a biography of David Collins, the first judge-advocate in colonial New South Wales. Nagle was a patron of the arts, serving as a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales and a patron of the Albury-Wodonga Regional Art Foundation. In his will he bequeathed a collection of Australian works to the Albury Regional Art Gallery, including paintings by his close friend Russell Drysdale. Nagle died on 16 September 2009 at the age of 96.

Kennedy International Airport. On June 11, 1971, a ticketless man named Gregory White boarded the Boeing 727 aircraft using force and demanded a machine gun, $75,000, and to be flown to North Vietnam. After murdering a passenger, White was soon apprehended at the John F. Kennedy International Airport by FBI agents, wounded, and arrested. It was the first attempted hijacking in the United States that resulted in a passenger fatality.  Hijacking Events  On June 11, 1971, Gregory White bypassed security at O'Hare International Airport and entered onto the tarmac, preparing to board TWA Flight 358. When flight attendant Cathy Culver asked White to present his boarding ticket, White took out a pistol and held it to Culver's head. He then entered the aircraft and demanded to be flown to North Vietnam, in addition to demanding a machine gun and $75,000. The pilot Captain Robert Eugene Elder and co-pilot Ronald Dupuis contacted TWA Operations for help. Passengers were allowed to exit the aircraft, and while they were doing so, U.S. Deputy Marshal Joseph Zito boarded by climbing a rope into a window in the cockpit. One passenger, Howard Franks, reentered the aircraft after forgetting an item and was shot dead by White. Captain Robert Elder dragged Franks' body back to the terminal, returned to the aircraft, and negotiated with the hijacker to stop at John F. Kennedy International Airport for a larger aircraft better suited for travel to North Vietnam. While en route to New York, Zito gave an extra firearm to Don Welsheimer, the flight engineer, and both exchanged gunfire between the cockpit and the cabin with the hijacker. Once on the ground in New York, a FBI agent shot White in the arm and White surrendered. The pilots, flight engineer, flight attendant, and Deputy Marshal then escaped down an escape slide. White followed and was arrested and taken to Queens General Hospital. Later, White was deemed too incompetent for trial and was committed to a state mental hospital in Chester, Illinois.
