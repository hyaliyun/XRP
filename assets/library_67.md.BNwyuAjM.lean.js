Napoleon wounded before Ratisbon (1809), C.Gautherol. Chłapowski in a lancer uniform of the Imperial Guard is on the right. Life His father Józef Chłapowski (born 1756, died 1826) was the baron of Kościan County and his mother Urszula was from the Moszczeńska family. His tutor as a child was the French immigrant priest Steinhoff. He began his education at the Piarists university in Rydzyna and then in Berlin. At the age of 14, his father placed him in the Prussian dragoon regiment of General Bruesewitz that was stationed in Greater Poland. At the same time the young soldier studied at the Berlin Inspection Officers Institute, which he graduated from in 1805 with a promotion to lieutenant. He sought exemption from participating in the wars with Napoleonic France in 1806. After the occupation of Berlin by the French, he left for Poznań . Here he joined the hundred-man honor guard of Emperor Napoleon formed by the local nobility after the Greater Poland Uprising of 1806 under the command of Umiński. During this period he gained favor with Napoleon, who appointed him a lieutenant. During the campaign in 1807, he fought in a voltaic company in the 9th Infantry Regiment commanded by General Fr. Antoni Paweł Sułkowski formed in Gniezno . Decorated after the battle of Tczew , as a half-company commander, the Virtuti Militari cross and the Legion_of_Honour. During the siege of Gdańsk he was captured by Prussia. After a peace in Tylża and returning from Riga , where he was interned, he was promoted (1 August) to captain and assigned as adjutant to General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski . In February 1808 he was summoned to Paris , where he became the orderly officer of Napoleon. During this stay, he graduated from military studies at the Paris Polytechnic School. He passed the final exams before General Bertrand . He went through Spanish and Austrian campaigns alongside Napoleon. For participating in the battle of Regensburg he was awarded the title of baron of the empire. In January 1811he was appointed the head of the Polish squadron of the 1st Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard . With him he carried out the Moscow ( 1812 ) and Saxon ( 1813 ) campaigns . During the latter, in Dresden, he asked for dismissal, which he obtained on 19 June . The decision was caused by Chłapowski's bitterness over Napoleon's attitude towards Poland (plans to give the Duchy of Warsaw to the tsar in exchange for peace) and the hardships of the campaigns he had gone through. Among the Napoleonic veterans, however, this action was badly received with accusations of desertion. As a retired colonel , he left for Paris. After the abdication of Napoleon, he went to Great Britain . During the \\"one hundred days of Napoleon \\"through Paris returned to Greater Poland ( 1815 ). Dezydery Chłapowski as Napoleon's staff officer He settled in his hometown Turwia, which he and Rąbin bought back from the debtor father of a professor, and then tidied up the property and began introducing a modern economy. To deepen their knowledge once again went on a trip to England ( 1818 - 1819 ), where among other things practiced physically working on the farm. Upon his return, he introduced solutions observed in England. Thanks to this, he repaid debts within 15 years and the property in Turwia quickly became one of the best farms in the Grand Duchy of Poznań . Chłapowski among others he introduced crop rotation instead of three- crop , used an iron plow and sowed soil enrichmentclover . As a result, Chłapowski was one of the guests invited to a conference in Berlin, where a plan of enfranchisement of peasants in the Grand Duchy was developed. He, for his part, allocated some of his land to parcel among peasants. In 1821 he married Antonina née Grudziński , sister of the Łowicz duchess Joanna , wife of the grand prince Konstanty . He was a deputy from the knighthood from the Kościan poviat to the provincial parliament of the Grand Duchy of Poznań in 1827 [1] and in 1830 [2] . He was a co-founder and activist of Credit Land and Fire Insurance Association. Palace in Turwia Baron Chłapowskis' coat of arms (French empire) Polish noble Dryja coat of arms When the November Uprising broke out, he put on his uniform again and crossed the border, reporting to the Polish insurgent army. He has developed a bold and interesting offensive plan, including capture of Brest on the Bug , but it was not approved by Józef Chłopicki , the dictator of the uprising , who preferred defensive tactics. It was only after the removal of Chłopicki that Chłapowski received the command of the brigade. He took part in the battle of Grochów , in which he himself headed the charge of the cavalry holding back Russian infantry after the withdrawal of Polish infantry. Then, under the command of the inept general Antoni Giełgud, he took part in the expedition to Lithuania during which he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General . Despite a number of minor victories, Giełgud's indecision about Chłapowski's offensive plans for a quick attack on Vilnius before the arrival of major Russian forces led to the defeat of the expedition to Lithuania. By decision of the National Council, Chłapowski was finally promoted to the rank of division general and was entrusted with the supreme command in Lithuania, but it did not arrive in time (Chłapowski found out about it only in Prussia). The unit was forced to cross the Prussian-Russian border, where Chłapowski, as a Prussian subject, was sentenced to one year in prison. He avoided confiscating the property and the punishment was instead converted into a high fine. He served his sentence in a fortress in Szczecin , where he wrote a textbook On agriculture. After being released, he returned to Turwia. He was politically associated with his former subordinate Karol Marcinkowski . In the years 1838 - 1845 worked with the Guide Agricultural and Industrial , which posted articles of agriculture. He intended to set up an Agricultural University , which was to educate numerous apprentices at the Turkish estate. Among them were later activists such as Maksymilian Jackowski . He was also a co-founder and publisher of Przegląd Poznański and Sunday School . Throughout his activities he laid the foundations of organic work, thereby resisting Germanization. He supported enterprises such as the Poznań Bazaar and the Scientific Assistance Society as well as credit societies. He was a member of the national parliament. Correspondent member of the Galician Economic Society (1846-1879) . During the Greater Poland Uprising of 1848, he organized insurgent troops in his powiat. After the fall of the Spring of Nations , in Greater Poland, he became a member of the upper house of the Prussian Parliament, the House of Lords. Despite his strictness and Catholic views, which discouraged some liberals from him , his achievements made him a widely respected person with a great impact on the community of Greater Poland . He died on March 27, 1879, and was buried in Rąbin next to the local church . In 1899, his son, Kazimierz , published his father's diaries. Major General from April 25, 2014 Dezydery Chłapowski is the patron of the Ground Forces Training Center in Wędrzyn . The general was also a promoter of mid-field tree plantings in Poland, which contributed to the economic success of his property and is still favorable to agriculture in this area [5] [6] . In order to preserve his agricultural and natural heritage, in 1992 and again in 2014, a Landscape Park was created around his estate in Turwia. Its special purpose is to preserve the system of mid-field plantings with \\"(...) high natural, landscape, scientific, didactic and cultural values\\".

In mathematics, orientation is a geometric notion that in two dimensions allows one to say when a cycle goes around clockwise or counterclockwise, and in three dimensions when a figure is left-handed or right-handed. In linear algebra, the notion of orientation makes sense in arbitrary finite dimension. In this setting, the orientation of an ordered basis is a kind of asymmetry that makes a reflection impossible to replicate by means of a simple rotation. Thus, in three dimensions, it is impossible to make the left hand of a human figure into the right hand of the figure by applying a rotation alone, but it is possible to do so by reflecting the figure in a mirror. As a result, in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, the two possible basis orientations are called right-handed and left-handed (or right-chiral and left-chiral). The orientation on a real vector space is the arbitrary choice of which ordered bases are \\"positively\\" oriented and which are \\"negatively\\" oriented. In the three-dimensional Euclidean space, right- handed bases are typically declared to be positively oriented, but the choice is arbitrary, as they may also be assigned a negative orientation. A vector space with an orientation selected is called an oriented' vector space, while one not having an orientation selected, is called '. Definition Let V be a finite-dimensional real vector space and let b1 and b2 be two ordered bases for V. It is a standard result in linear algebra that there exists a unique linear transformation A : V → V that takes b1 to b2. The bases b1 and b2 are said to have the same orientation (or be consistently oriented) if A has positive determinant; otherwise they have opposite orientations. The property of having the same orientation defines an equivalence relation on the set of all ordered bases for V. If V is non-zero, there are precisely two equivalence classes determined by this relation. An orientation on V is an assignment of +1 to one equivalence class and −1 to the other. Every ordered basis lives in one equivalence class or another. Thus any choice of a privileged ordered basis for V determines an orientation: the orientation class of the privileged basis is declared to be positive. For example, the standard basis on Rn provides a standard orientation on Rn (in turn, the orientation of the standard basis depends on the orientation of the Cartesian coordinate system on which it is built). Any choice of a linear isomorphism between V and Rn will then provide an orientation on V. The ordering of elements in a basis is crucial. Two bases with a different ordering will differ by some permutation. They will have the same/opposite orientations according to whether the signature of this permutation is ±1. This is because the determinant of a permutation matrix is equal to the signature of the associated permutation. Similarly, let A be a nonsingular linear mapping of vector space Rn to Rn. This mapping is orientation-preserving if its determinant is positive. For instance, in R3 a rotation around the Z Cartesian axis by an angle α is orientation-preserving: :: \\\\mathbf {A}_1 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos \\\\alpha & -\\\\sin \\\\alpha & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin \\\\alpha & \\\\cos \\\\alpha & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} while a reflection by the XY Cartesian plane is not orientation-preserving: :: \\\\mathbf {A}_2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix} Zero-dimensional case The concept of orientation degenerates in the zero-dimensional case. A zero-dimensional vector space has only a single point, the zero vector. Consequently, the only basis of a zero- dimensional vector space is the empty set \\\\emptyset. Therefore, there is a single equivalence class of ordered bases, namely, the class \\\\\\\\{\\\\emptyset\\\\\\\\} whose sole member is the empty set. This means that an orientation of a zero- dimensional space is a function :\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{\\\\emptyset\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\} \\\\to \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\\\\\}. It is therefore possible to orient a point in two different ways, positive and negative. Because there is only a single ordered basis \\\\emptyset, a zero- dimensional vector space is the same as a zero-dimensional vector space with ordered basis. Choosing \\\\\\\\{\\\\emptyset\\\\\\\\} \\\\mapsto +1 or \\\\\\\\{\\\\emptyset\\\\\\\\} \\\\mapsto -1 therefore chooses an orientation of every basis of every zero-dimensional vector space. If all zero-dimensional vector spaces are assigned this orientation, then, because all isomorphisms among zero-dimensional vector spaces preserve the ordered basis, they also preserve the orientation. This is unlike the case of higher-dimensional vector spaces where there is no way to choose an orientation so that it is preserved under all isomorphisms. However, there are situations where it is desirable to give different orientations to different points. For example, consider the fundamental theorem of calculus as an instance of Stokes' theorem. A closed interval is a one-dimensional manifold with boundary, and its boundary is the set }. In order to get the correct statement of the fundamental theorem of calculus, the point should be oriented positively, while the point should be oriented negatively. On a line The one-dimensional case deals with a line which may be traversed in one of two directions. There are two orientations to a line just as there are two orientations to a circle. In the case of a line segment (a connected subset of a line), the two possible orientations result in directed line segments. An orientable surface sometimes has the selected orientation indicated by the orientation of a line perpendicular to the surface. Alternate viewpoints Multilinear algebra For any n-dimensional real vector space V we can form the kth-exterior power of V, denoted ΛkV. This is a real vector space of dimension \\\\tbinom{n}{k}. The vector space ΛnV (called the top exterior power) therefore has dimension 1. That is, ΛnV is just a real line. There is no a priori choice of which direction on this line is positive. An orientation is just such a choice. Any nonzero linear form ω on ΛnV determines an orientation of V by declaring that x is in the positive direction when ω(x) > 0. To connect with the basis point of view we say that the positively-oriented bases are those on which ω evaluates to a positive number (since ω is an n-form we can evaluate it on an ordered set of n vectors, giving an element of R). The form ω is called an orientation form. If {ei} is a privileged basis for V and {ei∗} is the dual basis, then the orientation form giving the standard orientation is . The connection of this with the determinant point of view is: the determinant of an endomorphism T : V \\\\to V can be interpreted as the induced action on the top exterior power. Lie group theory Let B be the set of all ordered bases for V. Then the general linear group GL(V) acts freely and transitively on B. (In fancy language, B is a GL(V)-torsor). This means that as a manifold, B is (noncanonically) homeomorphic to GL(V). Note that the group GL(V) is not connected, but rather has two connected components according to whether the determinant of the transformation is positive or negative (except for GL0, which is the trivial group and thus has a single connected component; this corresponds to the canonical orientation on a zero-dimensional vector space). The identity component of GL(V) is denoted GL+(V) and consists of those transformations with positive determinant. The action of GL+(V) on B is not transitive: there are two orbits which correspond to the connected components of B. These orbits are precisely the equivalence classes referred to above. Since B does not have a distinguished element (i.e. a privileged basis) there is no natural choice of which component is positive. Contrast this with GL(V) which does have a privileged component: the component of the identity. A specific choice of homeomorphism between B and GL(V) is equivalent to a choice of a privileged basis and therefore determines an orientation. More formally: \\\\pi_0(\\\\operatorname{GL}(V)) = (\\\\operatorname{GL}(V)/\\\\operatorname{GL}^+(V) = \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\\\\\}, and the Stiefel manifold of n-frames in V is a \\\\operatorname{GL}(V)-torsor, so V_n(V)/\\\\operatorname{GL}^+(V) is a torsor over \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\\\\\}, i.e., its 2 points, and a choice of one of them is an orientation. Geometric algebra thumbleft150pxParallel plane segments with the same attitude, magnitude and orientation, all corresponding to the same bivector . The various objects of geometric algebra are charged with three attributes or features: attitude, orientation, and magnitude. For example, a vector has an attitude given by a straight line parallel to it, an orientation given by its sense (often indicated by an arrowhead) and a magnitude given by its length. Similarly, a bivector in three dimensions has an attitude given by the family of planes associated with it (possibly specified by the normal line common to these planes ), an orientation (sometimes denoted by a curved arrow in the plane) indicating a choice of sense of traversal of its boundary (its circulation), and a magnitude given by the area of the parallelogram defined by its two vectors. Orientation on manifolds The orientation of a volume may be determined by the orientation on its boundary, indicated by the circulating arrows. Each point p on an n-dimensional differentiable manifold has a tangent space TpM which is an n-dimensional real vector space. Each of these vector spaces can be assigned an orientation. Some orientations \\"vary smoothly\\" from point to point. Due to certain topological restrictions, this is not always possible. A manifold that admits a smooth choice of orientations for its tangent spaces is said to be orientable.

Marina Gamba was born around 1570 in Venice.  Relationship with Galileo Galilei  During one of his frequent trips to Venice, Galileo met a young woman named Marina, daughter of Andrea Gamba, and started a relationship with her. She moved into his house in Padua and bore him three children: Virginia (16 August 1600 – 1634), later Sister Maria Celeste; Livia (1601–1659), later Sister Arcangela; and Vincenzo (1606–1649). In none of the three baptismal records is Galileo named as the father. Virginia was described as \\"daughter by fornication of Marina of Venice,\\" with no mention of the father; on Livia's baptismal record the name of the father was left blank; Vincenzo's baptismal record announced \\"father uncertain\\" (Galileo's Daughter 24, Dava Sobel, 1999). Galileo's position as a professor and his many friendships among the Venetian nobility probably made it unwise for him to figure officially as the children's father. When Galileo left Padua for good in 1610 to take up his position at the Medici court in Florence, he took the two daughters with him but left their mother behind with 4 year-old Vincenzo, who joined his father in Florence a few years later. With Marina no longer in the family, Galileo put his two daughters in a convent and managed to have Vincenzo legitimated by the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In his 1619 request for this, Galileo declared that at the time of his cohabitation with Marina, she \\"had never been married\\" and was \\"already dead\\" at the drawing up of the act. Vincenzo studied law and later became a lutenist like his namesake grandfather. He died in 1649. http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/itineraries/biography/VincenzoGalileiJunior.html  Confusion with Marina Bartoluzzi  Marina Gamba is often confused with Marina Bartoluzzi, who looked after Vincenzo while Galileo was settling in Florence, resorting to the sale of a lute to pay for her services. She was long believed to have remarried to a certain Giovanni Bartoluzzi, but it has been proven that they were two different persons. Marina Gamba is probably the Venetian Marina, 42 years of age who was said to have died on 21 August 1612, in the parish of San Daniele.

In 1839 the MCC began playing cricket matches near the current site of Southern Cross railway station. Powlett was elected inaugural President in 1841. Membership MCG which was completed in 2005. The Melbourne Cricket Club is the largest sporting club in Australia. As of August 2015 there were 104,000 members of the club, of which 62,700 were \\"full members\\" and 41,300 were \\"restricted members\\", with 242,000 people registered on the waiting list. That same year, a new category below Restricted Membership was created called Provisional Membership, which \\"is designed to prevent the already lengthy wait for membership of our club from extending to 40 years or more in generations to come.\\" Provisional members \\"have fewer benefits and less access to the Reserve than Full and Restricted members.\\" As of 31 January 2018, the waiting list \\"consist[s] of candidates nominated from 1 October 2000 to today.\\" Full membership entitles members to entry to the Members' Reserve at the MCG for all cricket and football matches and most special sporting events. Full members also have a number of added benefits, which include reciprocal rights at clubs and stadiums around Australia and overseas as well as the opportunity to attend numerous club functions exclusive to MCC members. Restricted members also have access to events, with the exception of the AFL Grand Final. Full members, but not restricted members, are also permitted to nominate candidates for the waiting list and to vote on club affairs. Reciprocal clubs Members of the MCC are able to access the members' area of reciprocal clubs, typically while on a short visit to the area. These benefits, with the exclusion of the VRC and Docklands Stadium, are reserved for full members. These clubs include: * Docklands Stadium Axcess One, Melbourne * Victoria Racing Club (VRC), Melbourne * Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney * Brisbane Cricket Ground Trust (Gabba), Brisbane * South Australian Cricket Association (Adelaide Oval), Adelaide * West Australian Cricket Association (WACA Ground), Perth * Tasmanian Cricket Association (Bellerive Oval), Hobart Also other overseas grounds, including the Singapore and Hong Kong Cricket Clubs, the Cricket Club of India and the Marylebone Cricket Club (Lord's). Cricket \\"Team of the Century\\" On 1 December 1999, the MCC announced its cricket team of the century, with all players who had played at least one season for the club since 1906-07 being eligible for selection. The team as selected was: #Bill Ponsford #Colin McDonald #Dean Jones #Hunter Hendry #Paul Sheahan #Warwick Armstrong (Captain) #Hugh Trumble #Robert Templeton #Max Walker #Hans Ebeling #Bert Ironmonger #Vernon Ransford (12th Man) All members of the team of the century except Robert Templeton had played at least one Test match for the Australian cricket team.

His flamboyant dress sense and stylish performances led to success, and he was considered a style icon in Britain and elsewhere in the early 1970s; Mike Myers credited Wyngarde with inspiring the character Austin Powers. Background and early life Peter Wyngarde's birth name, Cyril Goldbert, was confirmed when details of his estate were published in The London Gazette on 2 May 2019. His full name may have been Cyril Louis Goldbert, but facts about his life are difficult to confirm and verify. Wyngarde appears to have fabricated a false biography when he changed his name, including a later year of birth, a father with a different name, profession and ethnic background, and a false education history. The Guardian said in March 2020 that \\"his life story is shrouded in mystery\\". According to his own account, he was born on 23 August 1933 to a French mother and a British father at an aunt's home in Marseille, France. A 1956 Straits Times article about his mother gives Marseille as his birthplace. He claimed to be a maternal nephew of French actor-director Louis Jouvet. Public records indicate a different place and year of birth. On immigration documents related to two trips to the United States in 1960, Wyngarde stated his place of birth was Singapore, although during a subsequent visit to Singapore in 1972 he denied having previously been there. His birthday is usually given as 23 or 28 August, and different sources suggest birth years between 1924 and 1937, with 1927 being the most authoritative. In a 1993 interview Wyngarde claimed not to know his own age. Reports of his death in January 2018 gave his age as 90, suggesting that he was born in 1927. Interviewed in 1973, Wyngarde said: \\"As a child it was difficult to differentiate sometimes between fact and fantasy.\\" He often spoke about his traumatic early life. Wyngarde always claimed that his father was an Englishman named Henry Wyngarde who worked for the British Diplomatic Service in Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore and India, before becoming an importer-exporter of antique watches living in Eaton Square, London. A biography published in 2020Tina Wyngarde-Hopkins, Peter Wyngarde: A Life Amongst Strangers (Austin-Macauley, London, 2020) states he was born on 28 August 1928 in Marseille, and names his father as a merchant seaman called Henry Goldbert. Goldbert was born in present-day Ukraine, and grew up in British Malaya, where he became a naturalised British citizen. Wyngarde claimed that Goldbert was his stepfather, not his birth father. Peter Wyngarde's mother was Margherita or Marcheritta \\"Madge\\" Goldbert, Ahin (1908–1992).Scottish statutory death register 1992, ref 221/ 96, Stornoway The Ahins were a Eurasian family living in Singapore, then part of British Malaya. She and Henry Goldbert divorced in 1937 and she is said to have married Charles Léo Juvet,Wyngarde-Hopkins, page 20 although when she later married John (\\"Ian\\") MacAulay in Shanghai in 1947 her legal name is given as Marcheritta Goldbert.The National Archives of the UK; Kew, Surrey, England; General Register Office: Foreign Registers and Returns; Class: RG 33; Piece: 31 Wyngarde told an interviewer that after his parents' divorce his father took him to China \\"only months before war with China broke out\\" in the summer of 1937. He spoke about living in Shanghai when the Japanese Army took over the Shanghai International Settlement on 8 December 1941. Correspondence held in the UK's National Archives shows that in 1942 Henry Goldbert's three children including 15-year-old Cyril were living in Shanghai and that efforts were being made by the UK's Ministry of War Transport, the Prisoners of War Department and various boarding schools to facilitate the children's repatriation to the UK, but that Cyril could not be accommodated because of his age. In April 1943 he was interned in the Lunghua civilian internment camp.Civil Assembly Organization entry list, British Residents' Association, June 1943. In one interview in the 1970s, Wyngarde says that he was interned as an unaccompanied 5-year-old due to an administrative error,My Weekly magazine, 10 May 1975 but this appears to be age fabrication since records show that he was interned from age 15 to just before his 18th birthday. Author and fellow internee J.G. Ballard said that he and his family knew Goldbert in Shanghai during this time, but in an interview late in his life, Wyngarde denied having known Ballard. He began acting during his internment when he played all the characters in a version of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde.David Parkinson, \\"In memory of Peter Wyngarde, debonair star behind Jason King\\", BFI.org.uk, 18 January 2018. Following the Surrender of Japan the internment camps were liberated in August 1945. Cyril Goldbert left Shanghai that autumn and travelled to the UK on the Cunard-White Star Line ship Arawa. Passenger records show that he travelled alone, aged 18, and arrived in Southampton on 14 December 1945. A few months later, in 1946, he took his first professional acting roles. His own account of his journey from Shanghai to England was different. He claimed to have been 12 years old when he arrived in England in December 1945, not 18 as the passenger manifest says, and that the ship arrived in Liverpool not Southampton, and that it was greeted by King George VI.{{cite newsurl=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/peter-wyngarde-obituary- vwzj2798n title=Peter Wyngarde Obituary newspaper=The Times accessdate=2020-04-23]} He claimed to have spent two years in a Swiss sanatorium recovering from his war experiences before attending schools in England, France and Switzerland. He claimed that he studied in the Faculty of Law, University of Oxford for three months, before leaving to work in a London advertising agency for a while before starting work as a professional actor. Career Early acting career Having changed his name from Cyril Goldbert to Peter Wyngarde on arrival in the UK, within a few months he began his professional acting career. He first appeared at the Buxton Playhouse in 1946, and the following year in a production of Noël Coward's Present Laughter at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham. He appeared with Alec Guinness in Hamlet in London in 1951, and with Siobhán McKenna in Saint Joan in 1954. His theatre appearances included playing opposite Vivien Leigh in 1958, and as Cyrano de Bergerac at the Bristol Old Vic in 1959, which he considered a highlight of his career. From the mid-1950s, Wyngarde had roles in feature films, television plays and television series guest appearances. One of these, a television adaptation of Julien Green's novel South (1959, originally Sud), in which Wyngarde featured in a lead role, is thought to be the earliest television play with an overtly homosexual theme. He appeared as Long John Silver in an adaptation of The Adventures of Ben Gunn (1958), and as Sir Roger Casement in an episode of Granada Television's On Trial series produced by Peter Wildeblood. He also featured in the title role of Rupert of Hentzau in 1964. Wyngarde's film work was not extensive, but gained attention. He took the role of Pausanias opposite Richard Burton in the film Alexander the Great (1956), and appeared in the film The Siege of Sidney Street (1960) with Donald Sinden. In Jack Clayton's The Innocents (1961), he had brief unspeaking scenes as the leering Peter Quint with Deborah Kerr and Pamela Franklin. He followed this appearance as the lead in the occult thriller Night of the Eagle (US title: Burn Witch Burn, 1962), his only film appearance in a lead role. By the late 1960s, Wyngarde was guest starring in television series of the time, many of which were shown internationally, including The Avengers, The Saint, The Baron, The Champions and I Spy. He also appeared in The Prisoner (\\"Checkmate\\", 1967) as the authority figure called Number Two. Wyngarde was also a guest star, playing himself as a Shakespearean actor in Lucy in London (1968), a prime-time TV special starring Lucille Ball. Popular success as Jason King Wyngarde as Jason King Wyngarde became a British household name through his starring role in the espionage series Department S (1969). His Jason King character, a novelist turned sleuth, was reputedly based on the author Ian Fleming. King led a hedonistic lifestyle; he often got the girl but as she is about to kiss him manages to avoid it, much to the annoyance of co- actor Joel Fabiani. After that series ended, his character, the suave womaniser Jason King, was spun off into a new action espionage series entitled Jason King (1971), which ran for one season of 26 fifty-minute episodes. One obituary described Wyngarde as playing the role \\"in the manner of a cat walking on tiptoe, with an air of self-satisfaction\\", but that increasingly his acting became more mannered and he came to believe his own publicity. His director, Cyril Frankel, said: \\"It got to a point where he wouldn't accept direction.\\" Frankel also said: \\"He was a very fine actor, but unfortunately a difficult person.\\" The series led Wyngarde to briefly become an international celebrity, being mobbed by female fans in Australia. Carl Gresham, his promotional manager at this time said later that \\"During the '70s we had a contract to officially open over 30 Woolworths newly refurbished stores throughout the UK. Other than my friends and clients, Morecambe & Wise, Peter was the most requested and highest paid celebrity making personal appearances.\\" In the role, he \\"became a style icon, with his droopy moustache, hair that looked like a bearskin hat and a wardrobe of wide-lapelled, three- piece suits, cravats and open-necked shirts in colours so bright they might hurt sensitive eyes.\\" In 1970, he was described as \\"Britain’s best-dressed male personality\\", and the following year it was reported that more babies were christened Jason that year than ever before. Mike Myers later credited Wyngarde's dress sense with helping to inspire the character Austin Powers. He was the inspiration for the Marvel supervillain, Jason Wyngarde, who was a member of the Hellfire Club. Later career In 1974, Wyngarde played the lead role of the King of Siam in a stage revival of The King and I, initially with Sally Ann Howes as Anna, which ran for 260 performances at the Adelphi Theatre in London.Adrian Wright, West End Broadway, Woodridge: Boydell Press, 2012, p. 92. In the late 1970s, he performed in the theatre in South Africa and Austria. Also on stage he appeared in the thriller Underground with Raymond Burr and Marc Sinden (whose father Donald had worked with Wyngarde on The Siege of Sidney Street) at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Toronto and at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London in 1983.British Theatre Guide, 1983. Wyngarde played the masked character Klytus in the film Flash Gordon (1980) and Sir Robert Knight in the film Tank Malling (1989) with Ray Winstone. On TV he appeared in The Two Ronnies 1984 Christmas Special as Sir Guy. Other TV appearances include Doctor Who (in the four-episode-story Planet of Fire, 1984), Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense (1984), Bulman (1985), The Lenny Henry Show (1994) and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1994). After leaving a 1995 stage production of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari due to a throat infection while still in previews, Wyngarde mostly stopped acting except for occasional voice work. Having given up stage acting, Wyngarde continued to appear in public at Memorabilia and other events celebrating his screen performances. He appeared as a guest of Simon Dee in the Channel 4 one-off revival of his chat show Dee Time in 2003. Screenwriter Mark Millar says that when casting his 2004 film Layer Cake, the director Matthew Vaughn wanted Wyngarde for a role, but was told that he had died. In 2007, he participated in recording extras for a box-set of The Prisoner, including a mock interview segment titled \\"The Pink Prisoner\\". Having ascertained that Peter Wyngarde was alive after wrongly being told in 2004 that he had died, director Matthew Vaughn requested him again in 2011 for X-Men: First Class but was again wrongly advised that Wyngarde had died. In January 2014, he narrated an episode of the BBC Four Timeshift documentary strand How to Be Sherlock Holmes: The Many Faces of a Master Detective. In It was Alright in the 1960s, a 2015 documentary series for Channel 4, Wyngarde expressed his unease at having had to don blackface to play a Turk in The Saint, but said he had done it only in the hope that a theatre director might pick him to play Othello. Recordings In 1970, Wyngarde recorded an album released by RCA Victor entitled simply Peter Wyngarde, featuring a single, \\"La Ronde De L'Amour\\"/\\"The Way I Cry Over You\\". The album is a collection of spoken-word musical arrangements produced by Vic Smith and Hubert Thomas Valverde. Wyngarde claimed that: \\"It sold out in next to no time... but RCA point-blankly refused to press any more. I was fuming, as I'd been given a three-album contract with the company, who promised to release one LP every 12 months. The excuse was that production was being moved... They told me that everything would have to go on the back burner, but I just believe that they got cold feet\\". A promo single of the track \\"Rape\\" (entitled \\"Peter Wyngarde Commits Rape\\") was also issued in 1970. In 1998, the album was reissued on CD by RPM Records, re-titled When Sex Leers Its Inquisitive Head. The album is now usually treated as a curiosity because of its unusual spoken-word style and the controversial subject matter of some of the tracks. Personal life In his twenties Wyngarde was married to the actress Dorinda Stevens.Peter Wyngarde: Flamboyant actor renowned for his salacious exploits who became a household name in the 1970s when he played TV sleuth Jason King – The Times 18 January 2018 They married on 6 March 1951 and lived at 9 Holland Park, Kensington, separating after three years. By November 1955 Stevens is described in a TV Times profile as \\"a bachelor girl, sharing a mews flat near Portland Place, London, with Cassio, her wire-haired terrier\\". According to IMDB, Wyngarde and Stevens were divorced on 24 June 1956. Interviewed for The Sydney Morning Herald in 1972, Wyngarde said his biggest regret was that he \\"married far too young\\", adding: \\"It lasted three years and the last year was pretty hell. However, one just goes on learning from one's mistakes doesn't one?\\" From 1956 to 1958, Wyngarde was living with Ruby Talbot in London. He also called Vivien Leigh \\"the love of my life\\". From the mid-1950s, Wyngarde owned a country house called Conifer Tree in the village of Kilndown, near Cranbrook in Kent. The actress Dame Edith Evans was a neighbour. In the 1960s, he moved to a flat in number 1 Earls Terrace off Kensington High Street in London. He would live in the same building for the rest of his life. He shared a flat there for some years with fellow actor Alan Bates; and according to some sources this was a romantic relationship. It was always assumed within the acting community that Wyngarde was gay and while the nickname 'Petunia Winegum' is often quoted it may have originated in a comedy sketch rather than being a genuine nickname. In July 1974, Jeremy Dallas-Cope, a 23-year-old described as Wyngarde's former \\"male secretary and personal assistant\\", was found guilty at his trial at the Old Bailey and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, for forging nearly £3,000 worth of cheques from the actor's bank account. Upon the fraud scheme being discovered Dallas-Cope persuaded his flatmate Anthony O'Donoghue, a male model, \\"to attempt suicide and take the blame\\". O'Donoghue was found by police when close to death, and was sentenced to 15 months, after also being found guilty. Public attention was drawn to Wyngarde's personal life in September 1975 when he was fined £75 (under his probable real name, Cyril Louis Goldbert) for gross indecency with a crane driver in public toilets in Gloucester bus station. This followed a similar arrest in the toilets at Kennedy Gardens in Birmingham the previous year, which resulted in a caution.Before Austin Powers there was 'Jason King' – and the fabulous Peter Wyngarde who has died aged 90 – The Independent 18 January 2018 He told an interviewer in 1993 that he was an alcoholic and that at the height of his fame \\"I drank myself to a standstill ... I am amazed I am still here\\", but that he stopped drinking in the early 1980s. He was declared bankrupt in 1982 and again in 1988. An obituary reported that he lived partly on social security benefits. Morrissey writes in his 2013 autobiography about visiting Wyngarde at home in Earls Terrace: A Peter Wyngarde appreciation society, The Hellfire Club, was founded in 1992 with the actor's support, with members receiving its quarterly magazine by post. It went online in 2000, and maintains a regularly updated blog. The organiser of his appreciation society took Wyngarde's surname after his death and in 2020 she published a biography of him claiming to draw on personal knowledge. Death and legacy His agent and manager reported that Wyngarde was admitted to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London in October 2017 with an unspecified illness. He died on 15 January 2018. His death is not listed on the General Register Office for England and Wales Death Index 1989-2019.https://www.ancestry.co.uk/search/collections/60630/ An auction of 250 items from his estate took place on 26 March 2020. All items sold, and the auction fetched over £35,000. His trophy for \\"best dressed personality of 1970\\" reached the highest selling price with a winning bid of £2,200.

Infanterie- Division, nickname Pique As, 'Ace of spades', after the divisional emblem), was a military unit that served during World War II. Like most German infantry units it had no motorization, and relied on leg and horse mobility. History The 206th Infantry Division was raised on 17 August 1939 in Insterburg, East Prussia. It served during the invasion of Poland in 1939 as a reserve division for Army Group North. The 206th Infantry Division participated in Operation Typhoon as part of the XXIII Corps under the Ninth Army. At this time, the division was under the command of Lieutenant General Hugo Höfl. At the time of the Soviet Rzhev-Vyazma strategic offensive operation (8 January – 20 April 1942), Operation Mars, the division now led by Lieutenant General Alfons Hitter was again serving in XXIII Corps under the Ninth Army in the Molodoi Tud sector of the Rzhev salient. Here it came under attack by the Soviet 39th army of the Kalinin Front.Glantz, p. 154-156, 158, 159, 219, 272 The division is known to have used Marder Is from January 1943 to December 1943. In mid-1944, the division, still under the command of Lieutenant General Alfons Hitter, was one of those defending the Vitebsk salient as part of 3rd Panzer Army's LIII Corps. The Soviet offensive, Operation Bagration, which commenced on 22 June, saw the entire corps encircled within a matter of days, after Soviet breakthroughs around the city. While the Oberkommando des Heeres, after realising the situation was hopeless, reluctantly authorised a breakout operation by the other three divisions involved, the 206th was ordered to stay in Vitebsk and fight to the last man. By 26 June, Soviet forces had fought their way into the city, and General Gollwitzer, LIII Corps' commander, ordered the 206th to withdraw in defiance of the OKH orders. It was too late, however, and almost all the soldiers of the division were killed or taken prisoner. Its commander, Hitter, went on to join the NKFD in Soviet captivity.

The season officially lasted from June 16 to October 31, which was, at the time, considered the most likely period for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic Ocean. A total of ten storms from 1943 are listed in the Atlantic hurricane database, and an eleventh system that affected Florida and Georgia has been identified as a probable tropical depression. The first system of the year, dubbed the \\"Surprise hurricane\\", caused severe damage throughout Texas and Louisiana in June, partially because information about its approach was censored in the fray of World War II; the storm caused 19 deaths and $17 million in damage. A major hurricane in mid-August produced hurricane-force winds in Bermuda, and several other tropical cyclones throughout the year resulted in strong winds there. In September, a hurricane impacted the western Gulf Coast of the United States, then a tropical storm struck the Mid-Atlantic. The two storms resulted in $419,000 and $20,000 in damage, respectively; one death was attributed to the latter system. In mid-October, a strong hurricane resulted in flooding and damage to crops throughout the Caribbean; after becoming post-tropical, it contributed to moderate impacts across Nova Scotia. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1943 till:01/11/1943 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1943 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_≤39_mph_(≤62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39–73_mph_(63–117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74–95_mph_(118–153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96–110_mph_(154–177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111–129_mph_(178–208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130–156_mph_(209–251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_≥157_mph_(≥252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:23/06/1943 till:27/06/1943 color:TD text:\\"Unnumbered (TD)\\" from:25/07/1943 till:30/07/1943 color:C2 text:\\"One (C2)\\" from:13/08/1943 till:19/08/1943 color:TS text:\\"Two (TS)\\" from:19/08/1943 till:25/08/1943 color:C4 text:\\"Three (C4)\\" from:01/09/1943 till:09/09/1943 color:C3 text:\\"Four (C3)\\" from:13/09/1943 till:15/09/1943 color:TS text:\\"Five (TS)\\" from:15/09/1943 till:20/09/1943 color:C2 text:\\"Six (C2)\\" barset:break from:28/09/1943 till:01/10/1943 color:TS text:\\"Seven (TS)\\" from:01/10/1943 till:03/10/1943 color:TS text:\\"Eight (TS)\\" from:11/10/1943 till:17/10/1943 color:C2 text:\\"Nine (C2)\\" from:20/10/1943 till:26/10/1943 color:TS text:\\"Ten (TS)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1943 till:01/07/1943 text:June from:01/07/1943 till:01/08/1943 text:July from:01/08/1943 till:01/09/1943 text:August from:01/09/1943 till:01/10/1943 text:September from:01/10/1943 till:31/10/1943 text:October TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale)\\" Systems Hurricane One The Surprise Hurricane of 1943 The 1943 Surprise hurricane was the first hurricane to be entered by a reconnaissance aircraft. An area of low pressure was first observed over the Southeastern United States and eastern Gulf of Mexico on June 23\\\\. It tracked west-northwest and, in conjunction with surface observations along the Louisiana coastline, was found to have organized into a tropical storm by 18:00 UTC on July 25 while situated about 110 mi (175 km) southeast of the Mississippi Delta. The nascent cyclone rapidly intensified thereafter, attaining hurricane intensity by 18:00 UTC on June 26 and reaching its peak as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) early the following morning. The compact hurricane moved ashore the coastline of Texas near Galveston Bay at 18:00 UTC on July 7, around which time it was intercepted by the first reconnaissance aircraft to intentionally fly into a tropical cyclone. The storm weakened once inland and dissipated about 60 mi (95 km/h) early of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex by 00:00 UTC on July 30\\\\. In the fray of World War II, information was censored by the Federal government of the United States across the country, including reports from ships that the Weather Bureau heavily relied upon for hurricane updates. The cyclone that affected the Texas and Louisiana coastlines, therefore, was dubbed the 1943 \\"Surprise\\" hurricane. Documentation of the storm's impacts suggests it was the worst since the 1915 Galveston hurricane. The Houston, Texas Metropolitan Airport recorded a peak wind gust of 132 mph (212 km/h). Two utility towers over the Houston Ship Channel, built to withstand winds of roughly 120 mph (195 km/h), were toppled. Along the coastline near Texas City, storm surge values were surprisingly light at between 3–6 ft (0.9–1.8 m), but 90% of homes either suffered water damage or were completely destroyed. Rising water from Galveston Bay resulted in flooding throughout the city itself, and a three-story building was collapsed by strong winds. Rainfall across Texas and Louisiana varied, but Devers, Texas, recorded a maximum storm total of 23 in (584 mm). Widespread freshwater flooding occurred in the Beaumont and Port Arthur areas. At Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, scores of air cadets and soldiers held onto the wings of airplanes to prevent them from going airborne; almost two dozen were injured in the aftermath. Offshore, the hopper dredge Galveston and tugboat Titan were capsized, leading to a total of 15 deaths. Overall, damage from the hurricane reached $17 million, 19 deaths were documented, and hundreds of people were injured. As a result of the casualties, the decision to censor information during an approaching storm was never again repeated. Tropical Storm Two A minimal tropical storm was first discovered about 80 mi (130 km) east of Antigua and Barbuda around 12:00 UTC on August 13\\\\. It passed just north of the Caribbean Sea while on a west- northwest track, reaching peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) by early on August 16\\\\. It curved northwest the following day before then turning northeast between the East Coast of the United States and Bermuda. The storm steadily lost intensity and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 12:00 UTC on August 19, and it was last documented six hours later. In the wake of the 1943 Surprise hurricane, this was the first tropical cyclone that reconnaissance aircraft flew through and had observations reported back to the Weather Bureau during real-time operations. Hurricane Three The third tropical cyclone of the 1943 season was noted about 265 mi (425 km) east of Barbados around 06:00 UTC on August 19\\\\. Like its predecessor, the storm steered clear of the Caribbean on its west-northwest course, producing only minor squally weather across the Leeward Islands as it intensified. It became a hurricane around 00:00 UTC on August 20, intensified into the season's first major hurricane by 18:00 UTC on August 22, and further organized to attain its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) around 06:00 UTC on August 24\\\\. It curved northeast after passing within 165 mi (265 km) of Bermuda, where winds peaked at 81 mph (130 km/h), interacting with a high- latitude cyclone to become extratropical by 00:00 UTC on August 26\\\\. The post- tropical cyclone gradually lost strength and was last noted over the far northern Atlantic. Hurricane Four A few days after the dissipation of Hurricane Three, a new tropical storm on the cusp of hurricane intensity was identified about 630 mi (1,015 km) southeast of Bermuda around 06:00 UTC on September 1\\\\. The system steadily strengthened as it moved erratically, attaining peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) by 06:00 UTC on September 4\\\\. After passing within 120 mi (195 km) of Bermuda, delivering a period of tropical storm-force winds to the island, the hurricane was directed north and then northeast by a developing area of high pressure. It brushed Nova Scotia before moving ashore the southern coastline of Newfoundland, ultimately transitioning into an extratropical cyclone by 00:00 UTC on September 10\\\\. Tropical Storm Five The northern end of a trough developed into a tropical depression just north of the Berry Islands in the Bahamas around 00:00 UTC on September 13\\\\. It attained tropical storm intensity six hours later and attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) by 18:00 UTC as it moved north-northeast. The cyclone lost tropical characteristics by 12:00 UTC on September 15 while positioned about 95 mi (155 km) south-southeast of Nantucket and subsequently tracked across Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. It was last observed over the northern Atlantic on September 17\\\\. Impacts from the storm were relegated to heavy rainfall along the shores of Nantucket, \\"extraordinarily high tides\\" northeast from Cape Cod, as well as gale-force winds and 1.2 in (30 mm) of rainfall from the post-tropical cyclone within Nova Scotia. Hurricane Six A circulation aloft was first documented across the western Gulf of Mexico on September 12\\\\. It became evident in surface maps three days later, marking the formation of a tropical storm by 18:00 UTC about 270 mi (435 km) southeast of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. The nascent cyclone tracked northwest and attained hurricane intensity on September 16 before reaching its peak as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) the following morning. Thereafter, an area of high pressure over the northern High Plains forced the system to complete a counter-clockwise loop. It turned northeast and steadily weakened before reaching the southern coastline of Louisiana as a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on September 20\\\\. As a tropical cyclone, the system produced tropical storm-force winds along a wide stretch of the Texas coastline, peaking at 62 mph (100 km/h) in Freeport. A tide of 4.5 ft (1.4 m) was also recorded there. About five percent of the rice crop in Jefferson County was ruined, while buildings were damaged around Galveston. Farther east, much of southern Mississippi and Louisiana received between 5–10 in (127–254 mm) of rainfall, peaking at 19 in (482 mm) in Morgan City, Louisiana. The combination of heavy precipitation and backwater flooding led to 3–5 ft (0.9–1.5 m) of inundation just south of Raceland. Levees in False Bayou came within inches of overflowing, forcing numerous families to higher grounds. Total damage along the coastline reached $419,000. Tropical Storm Seven A tropical wave ascended to tropical storm status by 06:00 UTC on September 28 while located about 230 mi (370 km) south of Bermuda. It moved northwest and then west- northwest, steadily organizing to attain peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) early on September 30\\\\. The storm then moved ashore the central coast of Maryland and was last distinguishable near Williamsport, Pennsylvania, around 00:00 UTC on October 2\\\\. Considerable damage to crops, and lesser damage to structures, was inflicted throughout the Norfolk and Cape Charles, Virginia, areas, with damage estimated at $20,000. Rainfall was generally light, peaking at 4.6 in (117 mm) in Diamond Springs, but did result in some street flooding. A small ship and several small boats were sunk. Atlantic City, New Jersey, reported a maximum gust of 70 mph (113 km/h), and only slightly weaker gusts were recorded throughout Virginia. One death was reported. Tropical Storm Eight On the first day of October, a strong tropical storm with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) was observed about 620 mi (1,000 km) southeast of Bermuda, where winds near gale-force were later observed. No further intensification occurred as the cyclone moved northwest and then curved northeast, and it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 06:00 UTC on October 3\\\\. The system crossed Nova Scotia and Newfoundland before entering the far northern Atlantic. Hurricane Nine Hurricane San Calixto of 1943 A tropical storm was documented passing through the Windward Islands into the Caribbean Sea early on October 11\\\\. It intensified into a hurricane by 12:00 UTC the next morning, whereupon it began a curve toward the north. The cyclone passed through the Mona Passage and attained its peak a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) shortly thereafter. Passing within 180 mi (290 km) of Bermuda, it produced winds around tropical storm-force there before it was last documented over the northwestern Atlantic early on October 17. As the cyclone entered the Caribbean Sea, it produced maximum winds of 40–50 mph (64–80 km/h) in Saint Lucia. Puerto Rico recorded winds near 60 mph (97 km/h) which unroofed houses. Heavy rainfall, peaking at 17.6 in (447 mm) in Toro Negro, led to flooding in several communities. The combination of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and high seas resulted in severe damage to the island's coffee crop. As the hurricane passed through the western Atlantic, Bermuda recorded a period of tropical storm-force winds. The USS Lee Fox encountered the storm on its voyage and was nearly capsized. As a post- tropical cyclone, the system produced winds near 70 mph (110 km/h) across Nova Scotia, cut electricity to Liverpool and Annapolis Valley (where the apple crop sustained $300,000 in losses), and disrupted telephone service in Halifax. Heavy surf washed out a 200 ft (60 m) section of railway in Shelburne while some railway lines in Lockeport suffered damage. A barge was severed from a large ship in Halifax and went aground on Georges Island. Tropical Storm Ten The final tropical cyclone of the season formed about 160 mi (260 km) northeast of the Honduras–Nicaragua border around 12:00 UTC on October 20\\\\. The fledgling cyclone intensified into a tropical storm twelve hours later and then attained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) a while thereafter, marking its peak intensity. The system moved west for several days and passed through the Belize Barrier Reef before executing a sharp eastward turn early on October 24, causing only delayed shipping and aviation schedules, as well as peak winds of 35 mph (56 km/h) in the Swan Islands. From there, it maintained its status as a weak storm before transitioning into a post-tropical cyclone about 130 mi (215 km) southwest of the Cayman Islands by 06:00 UTC on October 26\\\\. Other systems On June 23, a 1,015 mb (hPa; 29.98 inHg) closed low—likely a tropical depression–was documented over the Little Bahama Banks. It drifted slowly northwest, moving ashore near the Florida–Georgia border by early on June 27\\\\. Gusty winds were recorded in Jacksonville and Savannah, but otherwise no impacts of note occurred.

The district is at an altitude of 697 metres above sea level. It covers an area of approximately 863.50 km² of alpine headlands and in 2017 had a population of 11,477. The town is located 48 km southeast of Munich. Lake Schliersee and Lake Tegernsee, around which are the internationally renowned spas, Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern and Tegernsee, are nearby. Miesbach was founded around the year 1000 and was for hundreds of years the seat of the County of Hohenwaldeck. In the 19th century it became the center of the conservation movement for the traditional costumes, the Tracht. Miesbach also has a rich history as a pilgrimage and a mining village, which can still be seen in the city landscape. On September 16, 1882, Miesbach became the starting point for the first long distance transmission of electric power in the world. A 1,343 voltage power transmission line transferred electricity from Miesbach over a distance of 35 miles (57 km) to Munich. The starting point was the technologically advanced Miesbach mine, where electricity was generated using a steam engine. On the receiving end in the Munich Glass Palace, an electric pump powered an artificial waterfall. With this, Oskar von Miller and Marcel Deprez were able to show that electric power could indeed be transferred over long distances. Miesbach is the birthplace of Verismo painter Christian Schad.

She was the first woman elected to membership in the American Antiquarian Society.  Early life and education  Esther Forbes was born to William and Harriette Merrifield Forbes on June 28, 1891, in Westborough, Massachusetts. She moved with her family to Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1898. She attended Bancroft School in Worcester, and, from 1909 to 1912, she attended Bradford Academy, a junior college in Bradford, Massachusetts. In 1916, she joined her older sisters Cornelia and Katherine in Madison, Wisconsin, where Cornelia was in graduate school and Katharine was teaching. During this time she attended the classes at the University of Wisconsin.  Career  While in Wisconsin, she joined the editorial board of the Wisconsin Literary Magazine, along with another future Pulitzer Prizewinner, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. In 1919, she returned to Worcester and in late December began working for the editorial department of Houghton Mifflin Company in Boston. From 1924 to 1926, she wrote feature articles for the Boston Evening Transcript. She married Albert L. Hoskins, Jr., an attorney, on January 14, 1926, and left Houghton Mifflin. The couple moved to New York City. Her first novel, O Genteel Lady! was published in 1926 and was selected as the second book for the Book of the Month Club. In 1928 A Mirror for Witches was published. In 1933, she and Albert Hoskins divorced. Although she retained her married name, she wrote under her maiden name, Esther Forbes. Forbes returned to Worcester in 1933, where she lived with her mother and unmarried siblings. At this time, her mother, Harriette M. Forbes, began working closely with Forbes on the research for her novels, often at the local research library, the American Antiquarian Society. In 1935, Miss Marvel, in 1937 Paradise and in 1938, The General's Lady were published. Each of these were historical novels set in New England from colonial times through the early years of the Republic. In a break from her fiction, Forbes wrote a definitive biography of Paul Revere, Paul Revere and the World He Lived In (1942), for which she received the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for History. Also in 1943, she received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Clark University. In 1943, her best-known work Johnny Tremain was published, for which she received the Newbery Award in 1944.

Goo-goos supported candidates who would fight for political reform. The term was first used in the 1890s by their detractors. In New York City, the exclusive City Club of New York was the domain of \\"goo-goos,\\" who sponsored \\"Good Government Clubs\\" in every assembly district. Their efforts led to the election of a reform mayor in 1894, a setback for the political machine known as Tammany Hall. Members of several political reform movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were often labeled as goo-goos, including the Mugwumps and the Progressives. While old political labels like mugwump and progressive have been reinvented several times, and have shifted in meaning as a result, the term goo-goo still has political currency, and has changed little since it was first used in the late 19th century. In American politics, the term is still used occasionally as a mildly derisive label for high-minded citizens or reformers. Mike Royko, a Chicago political columnist of the late 20th century, revived the word without reinventing it. Royko was a critic and astute observer of Chicago politics. When Royko wrote about the \\"goo-goos\\" along Lake Shore Drive, he may even have agreed with them, but Slats Grobnik, his fictional Chicagoan, was very cynical about them.

The victims were James Chaney from Meridian, Mississippi, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner from New York City. All three were associated with the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) and its member organization, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). They had been working with the Freedom Summer campaign by attempting to register African Americans in Mississippi to vote. Since 1890 and through the turn of the century, southern states had systematically disenfranchised most black voters by discrimination in voter registration and voting. The three men had traveled from Meridian to the community of Longdale to talk with congregation members at a black church that had been burned; the churches were center of community organizing. The trio was arrested following a traffic stop for speeding outside Philadelphia, Mississippi, escorted to the local jail, and held for a number of hours. As the three left town in their car, they were followed by law enforcement and others. Before leaving Neshoba County, their car was pulled over. The three were abducted, driven to another location, and shot to death at close range. The three men's bodies were taken to an earthen dam where they were buried. The disappearance of the three men was initially investigated as a missing persons case. The civil rights workers' burnt-out car was found near a swamp three days after their disappearance. An extensive search of the area was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), local and state authorities, and four hundred United States Navy sailors. The three men's bodies were not discovered until two months later, when the team received a tip-off. During the investigation it emerged that members of the local White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the Neshoba County Sheriff's Office, and the Philadelphia Police Department were involved in the incident. The murder of the activists sparked national outrage and an extensive federal investigation, filed as Mississippi Burning (MIBURN), which later became the title of a 1988 film loosely based on the events. In 1967, after the state government refused to prosecute, the United States federal government charged eighteen individuals with civil rights violations. Seven were convicted and received relatively minor sentences for their actions. Outrage over the activists' disappearances helped gain passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Forty-one years after the murders took place, one perpetrator, Edgar Ray Killen, was charged by the state of Mississippi for his part in the crimes. In 2005 he was convicted of three counts of manslaughter and was given a 60-year sentence. On June 20, 2016, federal and state authorities officially closed the case, ending the possibility of further prosecution. Killen died in prison in January 2018. Background The KKK and a \\"Fiery Cross\\"; image from the 1920s In the early 1960s, the state of Mississippi, as well as most of the American South, defied federal direction regarding racial integration. Recent Supreme Court rulings had upset the Mississippi establishment, and White Mississippian society responded with open hostility. White supremacists used tactics such as bombings, murders, vandalism, and intimidation in order to discourage black Mississippians and their supporters from the Northern and Western states. In 1961, Freedom Riders, who challenged the segregation of interstate buses and related facilities, were attacked on their route. In September 1962, the University of Mississippi riots had occurred in order to prevent James Meredith from enrolling at the school. The White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a Ku Klux Klan splinter group based in Mississippi, was founded and led by Samuel Bowers of Laurel. As the summer of 1964 approached, white Mississippians prepared for what they perceived was an invasion from the north and west. College students had been recruited in order to aid local activists who were conducting grassroots community organizing, voter registration education and drives in the state. Media reports exaggerated the number of youths expected. One Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) representative is quoted as saying that nearly 30,000 individuals would visit Mississippi during the summer. Such reports had a \\"jarring impact\\" on white Mississippians and many responded by joining the White Knights. In 1890, Mississippi had passed a new constitution, supported by additional laws, which effectively excluded most black Mississippians from registering or voting. This status quo had long been enforced by economic boycotts and violence. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) wanted to address this problem by setting up Freedom Schools and starting voting registration drives in the state. Freedom schools were established in order to educate, encourage, and register the disenfranchised black citizens. CORE members James Chaney, from Mississippi, and Michael Schwerner, from New York City, intended to set up a Freedom School for black people in Neshoba County to try to prepare them to pass the comprehension and literacy tests required by the state. Missing persons poster created by the FBI in 1964, shows the photographs of Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner. Registering others to vote On Memorial Day 1964, Schwerner and Chaney spoke to the congregation at Mount Zion Methodist Church in Longdale, Mississippi about setting up a Freedom School. Schwerner implored the members to register to vote, saying, \\"you have been slaves too long, we can help you help yourselves\\". The White Knights learned of Schwerner's voting drive in Neshoba County and soon developed a plot to hinder the work and ultimately destroy their efforts. They wanted to lure CORE workers into Neshoba County, so they attacked congregation members and torched the church, burning it to the ground. On June 21, 1964, Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner met at the Meridian COFO headquarters before traveling to Longdale to investigate the destruction of the Mount Zion Church. Schwerner told COFO Meridian to search for them if they were not back by 4 p.m.; he said, \\"if we're not back by then start trying to locate us.\\" Arrest After visiting Longdale, the three civil rights workers decided not to take Road 491 to return to Meridian. The narrow country road was unpaved; abandoned buildings littered the roadside. They decided to head west on Highway 16 to Philadelphia, the seat of Neshoba County, then take southbound Highway 19 to Meridian, figuring it would be the faster route. The time was approaching 3 p.m., and they were to be in Meridian by 4 p.m. The CORE station wagon had barely passed the Philadelphia city limits when one of its tires went flat, and Deputy Sheriff Cecil Ray Price turned on his dashboard-mounted red light and followed them. The trio stopped near the Beacon and Main Street fork. With a long radio antenna mounted to his patrol car, Price called for Officers Harry Jackson Wiggs and Earl Robert Poe of the Mississippi Highway Patrol. Chaney was arrested for driving 65 mph in a 35 mph zone; Goodman and Schwerner were held for investigation. They were taken to the Neshoba County jail on Myrtle Street, a block from the courthouse. In the Meridian office, workers became alarmed when the 4 p.m. deadline passed without word from the three activists. By 4:45 p.m., they notified the COFO Jackson office that the trio had not returned from Neshoba County. The CORE workers called area authorities but did not learn anything; the contacted offices said they had not seen the three civil rights workers. Masterminding the conspiracy Parties to the conspiracy; Top row: Lawrence A. Rainey, Bernard L. Akin, Other \\"Otha\\" N. Burkes, Olen L. Burrage, Edgar Ray Killen. Bottom row: Frank J. Herndon, James T. Harris, Oliver R. Warner, Herman Tucker and Samuel H. Bowers Nine men, including Neshoba County Sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey, were later identified as parties to the conspiracy to murder Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner. Rainey denied he was ever a part of the conspiracy, but he was accused of ignoring the racially- motivated offenses committed in Neshoba County. At the time of the murders, the 41-year-old Rainey insisted he was visiting his sick wife in a Meridian hospital and was later with family watching Bonanza. As events unfolded, Rainey became emboldened with his newly found popularity in the Philadelphia community. Known for his tobacco chewing habit, Rainey was photographed and quoted in Life magazine: \\"Hey, let's have some Red Man\\", as other members of the conspiracy laughed while waiting for an arraignment to start. Fifty-year- old Bernard Akin had a mobile home business which he operated out of Meridian; he was a member of the White Knights. Seventy one-year-old Other N. Burkes, who usually went by the nickname of Otha, was a 25-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police. At the time of the December 1964 arraignment, Burkes was awaiting an indictment for a different civil rights case. Olen L. Burrage, who was 34 at the time, owned a trucking company. Burrage was developing a cattle farm which he called the Old Jolly Farm, which is where the three civil rights workers were found buried. Burrage, an honorably discharged U.S. Marine, is quoted as saying: \\"I got a dam big enough to hold a hundred of them.\\" Several weeks after the murders, Burrage told the FBI: \\"I want people to know I'm sorry it happened.\\" Edgar Ray Killen, a 39-year-old Baptist preacher and sawmill owner, decades later was convicted of orchestrating the murders. Frank J. Herndon, 46, operated a Meridian drive-in called the Longhorn; he was the Exalted Grand Cyclops of the Meridian White Knights. James T. Harris, also known as Pete, was a White Knight investigator. The 30-year-old Harris was keeping tabs on the three civil rights workers' every move. 54-year-old Oliver R. Warner, known as Pops, was a Meridian grocery owner and member of the White Knights. Herman Tucker lived in Hope, Mississippi, a few miles from the Neshoba County Fair grounds. Tucker, 36, was not a member of the White Knights, but he was a building contractor who worked for Burrage. The White Knights gave Tucker the assignment of getting rid of the CORE station wagon driven by the workers. White Knights Imperial Wizard Samuel H. Bowers, who served with the U.S. Navy during World War II, was not apprehended on December 4, 1964, but he was implicated the following year. Bowers, then 39, is credited with saying: \\"This is a war between the Klan and the FBI. And in a war, there have to be some who suffer.\\" On Sunday, June 7, 1964, nearly 300 White Knights met near Raleigh, Mississippi. Bowers addressed the White Knights about the \\"nigger-communist invasion of Mississippi\\" expected to take place in a few weeks, in what CORE announced as Freedom Summer. The men listened as Bowers said: \\"This summer the enemy will launch his final push for victory in Mississippi\\", and, \\"there must be a secondary group of our members, standing back from the main area of conflict, armed and ready to move. It must be an extremely swift, extremely violent, hit-and-run group.\\" Lynch mob forms Cecil R. Price, Travis M. Barnette, Alton W. Roberts, Jimmy K. Arledge, Jimmy Snowden. Bottom Row, L-R: Jerry M. Sharpe, Billy W. Posey, Jimmy L. Townsend, Horace D. Barnette, James Jordan. Although federal authorities believed many others took part in the Neshoba County lynching, only ten men were charged with the physical murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. One of these was Deputy Sheriff Price, 26, who played a crucial role in implementing the conspiracy. Before his friend Rainey was elected sheriff in 1963, Price worked as a salesman, fireman, and bouncer. Price, who had no prior experience in local law enforcement, was the only person who witnessed the entire event. He arrested the three men, released them the night of the murders, and chased them down state Highway 19 toward Meridian, eventually re-capturing them at the intersection near House, Mississippi. Price and the other nine men escorted them north along Highway 19 to Rock Cut Road, where they forced a stop and murdered the three civil rights workers. Killen went to Meridian earlier that Sunday to organize and recruit men for the job to be carried out in Neshoba County. Before the men left for Philadelphia, Travis M. Barnette, 36, went to his Meridian home to take care of a sick family member. Barnette owned a Meridian garage and was a member of the White Knights. Alton W. Roberts, 26, was a dishonorably discharged U.S. Marine who worked as a salesman in Meridian. Roberts, standing and weighing , was physically formidable and renowned for his short temper. According to witnesses, Roberts shot both Goodman and Schwerner at point blank range, then shot Chaney in the head after another accomplice, James Jordan, shot him in the abdomen. Roberts asked, \\"Are you that nigger lover?\\" to Schwerner, and shot him after the latter responded, \\"Sir, I know just how you feel.\\" Jimmy K. Arledge, 27, and Jimmy Snowden, 31, were both Meridian commercial drivers. Arledge, a high school drop-out, and Snowden, a U.S. Army veteran, were present during the murders. Jerry M. Sharpe, Billy W. Posey, and Jimmy L. Townsend were all from Philadelphia. Sharpe, 21, ran a pulp wood supply house. Posey, 28, a Williamsville automobile mechanic, owned a 1958 red and white Chevrolet; the car was considered fast and was chosen over Sharpe's. The youngest was Townsend, 17; he left high school in 1964 to work at Posey's Phillips 66 garage. Horace D. Barnette, 25, was Travis' younger half-brother; he had a 1957 two-toned blue Ford Fairlane sedan. Horace's car is the one the group took after Posey's car broke down. Officials say that James Jordan, 38, killed Chaney. He confessed his crimes to the federal authorities in exchange for a plea deal. Pursuit on Highway 19 After Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner's release from the Neshoba County jail around 10 p.m. on June 21, they were followed almost immediately by Deputy Sheriff Price in his 1957 white Chevrolet sedan patrol car. Soon afterward, the civil rights workers left the city limits located along Hospital Road and headed south on Highway 19. The workers arrived at Pilgrim's store, where they may have been inclined to stop and use the telephone, but the presence of a Mississippi Highway Patrol car, manned by Officers Wiggs and Poe, most likely dissuaded them. They continued south toward Meridian. Ford Station Wagon location near the Bogue Chitto River near Highway 21 () The lynch mob members, who were in Barnette's and Posey's cars, were drinking while arguing who would kill the three young men. Eventually Burkes drove up to Barnette's car and told the group: \\"They're going on 19 toward Meridian. Follow them!\\" After a quick rendezvous with Philadelphia Police officer Richard Willis, Price began pursuing the three civil rights workers. Posey's Chevrolet carried Roberts, Sharpe, and Townsend. The Chevy apparently had carburetor problems, and was forced to the side of the highway. Sharpe and Townsend were ordered to stay with Posey's car and service it. Roberts transferred to Barnette's car, joining Arledge, Jordan, Posey, and Snowden. Price eventually caught the CORE station wagon heading west toward Union, on Road 492. Soon he stopped them and escorted the three civil right workers north on Highway 19, back in the direction of Philadelphia. The caravan turned west on County Road 515 (also known as Rock Cut Road), and stopped at the secluded intersection of County Road 515 and County Road 284 (). The three men were subsequently shot by Jordan and Roberts. Chaney was also beaten before his death. Disposing of the evidence The station wagon on an abandoned logging road along Highway 21 After the victims had been shot, they were quickly loaded into their station wagon and transported to Burrage's Old Jolly Farm, located along Highway 21, a few miles southwest of Philadelphia where an earthen dam for a farm pond was under construction. Tucker was already at the dam waiting for the lynch mob's arrival. Earlier in the day, Burrage, Posey, and Tucker had met at either Posey's gas station or Burrage's garage to discuss these burial details, and Tucker most likely was the one who covered up the bodies using a bulldozer that he owned. An autopsy of Goodman, showing fragments of red clay in his lungs and grasped in his fists, suggests he was probably buried alive alongside the already dead Chaney and Schwerner. After all three were buried, Price told the group: Eventually, Tucker was tasked with disposing of the CORE station wagon in Alabama. For reasons unknown, the station wagon was left near a river in northeast Neshoba County along Highway 21. It was soon set ablaze and abandoned. Investigation and public attention President Lyndon B.

Protest outside the 1964 Democratic National Convention; some hold signs with portraits of slain civil rights workers, 24 August 1964 Sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey being escorted by two FBI agents to the federal courthouse in Meridian, Mississippi; October 1964 FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover initially ordered the FBI Office in Meridian, run by John Proctor, to begin a preliminary search after the three men were reported missing. That evening, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy escalated the search and ordered 150 federal agents to be sent from New Orleans. Two local Native Americans found the smoldering car that evening; by the next morning, that information had been communicated to Proctor. Joseph Sullivan of the FBI immediately went to the scene. By the next day, the federal government had arranged for hundreds of sailors from the nearby Naval Air Station Meridian to search the swamps of Bogue Chitto. During the investigation, searchers including Navy divers and FBI agents discovered the bodies of Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore in the area (the first was found by a fisherman). They were college students who had disappeared in May 1964. Federal searchers also discovered 14-year-old Herbert Oarsby, and five other unidentified Mississippi blacks, whose disappearances in the recent past had not attracted attention outside their local communities.Lynching of Chaney, Schwerner & Goodman ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans The disappearance of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner captured national attention. By the end of the first week, all major news networks were covering their disappearances. President Lyndon Johnson met with the parents of Goodman and Schwerner in the Oval Office. Walter Cronkite's broadcast of the CBS Evening News on June 25, 1964, called the disappearances \\"the focus of the whole country's concern\\". The FBI eventually offered a $25,000 reward (), which led to the breakthrough in the case. Meanwhile, Mississippi officials resented the outside attention. Sheriff Rainey said, \\"They're just hiding and trying to cause a lot of bad publicity for this part of the state.\\" Mississippi Governor Paul B. Johnson Jr. dismissed concerns, saying the young men \\"could be in Cuba\\". The bodies of the CORE activists were found only after an informant (discussed in FBI reports only as \\"Mr. X\\") passed along a tip to federal authorities. They were discovered on August 4, 1964, 44 days after their murder, underneath an earthen dam on Burrage's farm. Schwerner and Goodman had each been shot once in the heart; Chaney, a black man, had been severely beaten, castrated and shot three times. The identity of \\"Mr. X\\" was revealed publicly forty years after the original events, and revealed to be Maynard King, a Mississippi Highway Patrol officer close to the head of the FBI investigation. King died in 1966. In a famous eulogy for Chaney, CORE leader Dave Dennis voiced his rage, anguish, and turmoil:, pages 774–779 ::I blame the people in Washington DC and on down in the state of Mississippi just as much as I blame those who pulled the trigger. ... I'm tired of that! Another thing that makes me even tireder though, that is the fact that we as people here in the state and the country are allowing it to continue to happen. ... Your work is just beginning. If you go back home and sit down and take what these white men in Mississippi are doing to us. ... if you take it and don't do something about it. ... then God damn your souls! President Johnson and civil rights activists used the outrage over the activists' deaths to gain passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which Johnson signed on July 2. This and the Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965 contributed to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which Johnson signed on August 6 of that year. Malcolm X used the delayed resolution of the case in his argument that the federal government was not protecting black lives, and African-Americans would have to defend themselves: \\"And the FBI head, Hoover, admits that they know who did it, they've known ever since it happened, and they've done nothing about it. Civil rights bill down the drain.\\"Saladin Ambar, Malcolm X at Oxford Union: Racial Politics in a Global Era (Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 178 By late November 1964 the FBI accused 21 Mississippi men of engineering a conspiracy to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. Most of the suspects were apprehended by the FBI on December 4, 1964. The FBI detained the following individuals: B. Akin, E. Akin, Arledge, T. Barnette, Burkes, Burrage, Bowers, Harris, Herndon, Killen, Posey, Price, Rainey, Roberts, Sharpe, Snowden, Townsend, Tucker, and Warner. Two individuals who were not interviewed and photographed, H. Barnette and James Jordan, would later confess their roles during the murder. Because Mississippi officials refused to prosecute the killers for murder, a state crime, the federal government, led by prosecutor John Doar, charged 18 individuals under 18 U.S.C. §242 and §371 with conspiring to deprive the three activists of their civil rights (by murder). They indicted Sheriff Rainey, Deputy Sheriff Price and 16 other men. A U. S. Commissioner dismissed the charges six days later, declaring that the confession on which the arrests were based was hearsay. One month later, government attorneys secured indictments against the conspirators from a federal grand jury in Jackson. On February 24, 1965, however, Federal Judge William Harold Cox, an ardent segregationist, threw out the indictments against all conspirators other than Rainey and Price on the ground that the other seventeen were not acting \\"under color of state law.\\" In March, 1966, the United States Supreme Court overruled Cox and reinstated the indictments. Defense attorneys then made the argument that the original indictments were flawed because the pool of jurors from which the grand jury was drawn contained insufficient numbers of minorities. Rather than attempt to refute the charge, the government summoned a new grand jury and, on February 28, 1967, won reindictments. 1967 Federal trial Trial in the case of United States v. Cecil Price, et al., began on October 7, 1967 in the Meridian courtroom of Judge William Harold Cox, the same judge known to be an opponent of the civil rights movement. A jury of seven white men and five white women was selected. Defense attorneys exercised peremptory challenges against all seventeen potential black jurors. A white man, who admitted under questioning by Robert Hauberg, the U.S. Attorney for Mississippi, that he had been a member of the KKK \\"a couple of years ago,\\" was challenged for cause, but Cox denied the challenge. The trial was marked by frequent crises. Star prosecution witness James Jordan cracked under the pressure of anonymous death threats made against him and had to be hospitalized at one point. The jury deadlocked on its decision and Judge Cox employed the \\"Allen charge\\" to bring them to resolution. Seven defendants, mostly from Lauderdale County, were convicted. The convictions in the case represented the first ever convictions in Mississippi for the killing of a civil rights worker. Those found guilty on October 20, 1967, were Cecil Price, Klan Imperial Wizard Samuel Bowers, Alton Wayne Roberts, Jimmy Snowden, Billy Wayne Posey, Horace Barnette, and Jimmy Arledge. Sentences ranged from three to ten years. After exhausting their appeals, the seven began serving their sentences in March 1970. None served more than six years. Sheriff Rainey was among those acquitted. Two of the defendants, E.G. Barnett, a candidate for sheriff, and Edgar Ray Killen, a local minister, had been strongly implicated in the murders by witnesses, but the jury came to a deadlock on their charges and the Federal prosecutor decided not to retry them. On May 7, 2000, the jury revealed that in the case of Killen, they deadlocked after a lone juror stated she \\"could never convict a preacher\\". Further research and 2005 murder trial State history marker for the bombing of the Mount Zion Methodist Church For much of the next four decades, no legal action was taken regarding the murders. In 1989, on the 25th anniversary of the murders, the U.S. Congress passed a non-binding resolution honoring the three men; Senator Trent Lott and the rest of the Mississippi delegation refused to vote for it. The journalist Jerry Mitchell, an award- winning investigative reporter for Jackson's The Clarion-Ledger, wrote extensively about the case for six years. In the late 20th century, Mitchell had earned fame by his investigations that helped secure convictions in several other high-profile Civil Rights Era murder cases, including the murders of Medgar Evers and Vernon Dahmer, and the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham. In the case of the civil rights workers, Mitchell was aided in developing new evidence, finding new witnesses, and pressuring the state to take action by Barry Bradford, a high school teacher at Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois, and three of his students, Allison Nichols, Sarah Siegel, and Brittany Saltiel. Bradford later achieved recognition for helping Mitchell clear the name of the civil rights martyr Clyde Kennard. Together the student-teacher team produced a documentary for the National History Day contest. It presented important new evidence and compelling reasons to reopen the case. Bradford also obtained an interview with Edgar Ray Killen, which helped convince the state to investigate. Partially by using evidence developed by Bradford, Mitchell was able to determine the identity of \\"Mr. X\\", the mystery informer who had helped the FBI discover the bodies and end the conspiracy of the Klan in 1964.Mitchell, Jerry (December 2, 2007). \\"Documents Identify Whistle-blower\\", The Clarion-Ledger (Jackson, MS). Mitchell's investigation and the high school students' work in creating Congressional pressure, national media attention and Bradford's taped conversation with Killen prompted action. In 2004, on the 40th anniversary of the murders, a multi-ethnic group of citizens in Philadelphia, Mississippi, issued a call for justice. More than 1,500 people, including civil rights leaders and Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour, joined them to support having the case re-opened.\\"Statement Asking for Justice in the June 21, 1964, Murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner\\",The Neshoba Democrat. June 24, 2004. Retrieved July 7, 2011. On January 6, 2005, a Neshoba County grand jury indicted Edgar Ray Killen on three counts of murder. When the Mississippi Attorney General prosecuted the case, it was the first time the state had taken action against the perpetrators of the murders. Rita Bender, Michael Schwerner's widow, testified in the trial. On June 21, 2005, a jury convicted Killen on three counts of manslaughter; he was described as the man who planned and directed the killing of the civil rights workers. Killen, then 80 years old, was sentenced to three consecutive terms of 20 years in prison. His appeal, in which he claimed that no jury of his peers would have convicted him in 1964 based on the evidence presented, was rejected by the Supreme Court of Mississippi in 2007. On June 20, 2016, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood and Vanita Gupta, top prosecutor for the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department, announced that there would be no further investigation into the murders. \\"The evidence has been degraded by memory over time, and so there are no individuals that are living now that we can make a case on at this point,\\" Hood said.

Actor Hilly Hicks portrayed \\"Charles Gilmore\\", a fictionalized representation of James Chaney, actor Andrew Parks portrayed \\"Steven Bronson\\", a fictionalized representation of Andrew Goodman, and actor Peter Strauss portrayed \\"Ben Jacobs\\", a fictionalized representation of Schwerner. The sympathetic portrayal of FBI agents in Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan (1974) and Mississippi Burning (1988) angered civil rights activists, who believed that the Bureau received too much credit for solving the case and too little condemnation for its previous lack of action in regards to civil rights abuses. *The feature film Mississippi Burning (1988), starring Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman, is loosely based on the murders and the ensuing FBI investigation.

He switched to the new safe Labor electorate of Calwell in 1984.Ernest Healy (1993), 'Ethnic ALP Branches - The Balkanisation of Labor,' in People and Place, Vol.1, No.4, Page 40Ernest Healy (1995), 'Ethnic ALP Branches - The Balkanisation of Labor Revisited,' People and Place, Vol.3, No.3, p.48-54 Theophanous was heavily interested in immigration matters, and from 1989 to 1993, was Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. In this capacity, Theophanous' committee produced a number of reports on immigration policy. In 1993, Theophanous was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health. In December, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services. In March 1994, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister Paul Keating, who had enjoyed his support in two caucus leadership ballots, which made him unusual in the Left grouping, who mostly supported Bob Hawke. Theophanous also wrote two more books: \\"Understanding Social Justice: an Australian perspective\\" (1994) ; and \\"Understanding Multiculturalism and Australian Identity\\" (1995). Both books were officially launched by Prime Minister Keating and were used in a number of academic courses. Resignation During 1998 Theophanous came under suspicion for being involved in migration fraud, and in July 1998 the National Crime Authority launched an investigation, codenamed Operation Legume. He was charged with defrauding the Commonwealth by making false representations in relation to an immigration matter, taking an unlawful inducement and soliciting an unlawful inducement. Theophanous resigned from the Labor Party on 18 April 2000. His brother, Theo, condemned the resignation, calling it \\"an action taken by him with which I strongly disagree. I do not believe his actions are an appropriate response\\". At this time, Andrew Theophanous announced that he would serve out his term as an independent. During this period as an independent, he initiated a number of parliamentary motions on immigration, refugees, multicultural affairs and human rights. He recontested the seat as an independent candidate at the 2001 election. He polled 9.6% of the vote, with the support of the Unity Party, but the seat was won by the new Labor candidate and former staffer, Maria Vamvakinou. Theophanous was jailed in 2002 and sentenced to six years in prison. However, he served only two years. His barrister, Stephen Shirrefs SC, successfully appealed the conviction for conspiracy to defraud. Family Theophanous is married to Dr. Kathryn Eriksson, an archaeologist. In November 2005, she was elected as a Brimbank Horseshoe Bend Ward Councillor. Theophanous' brother Theo Theophanous is a former state Labor politician. His niece Kat Theophanous is the current member for Northcote. See also *Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd References Further reading * Theophanous, Andrew C.

The lusheng is a type of mouth organ used by the Miao of Guizhou for pentatonic antiphonal courtship songs. The Hani of Honghe are known for a unique kind of choral, micro-tonal rice-transplanting songs. Nakhi music The Nakhi of Lijiang play a type of song and dance suite called baisha xiyue, which was supposedly brought by Kublai Khan in AD 1253. Nakhi dongjing is an ancient type of music related to southern Chinese forms, and is popular today. Both these styles are quite old, which has led Nakhi music to be called a \\"living fossil\\" of Chinese music. In addition to donjing and baisha xiyue, a style called huangjing yinyue also has an ancient history in the area, but is no longer known. Nakhi musicians Baisha xiyue Supposedly introduced to the Nakhi by Kublai Khan when he conquered the Kingdom of Dali and received help from a Nakhi leader named Mailiang, basha xiyue is performed by orchestras. There are 24 simple, energetic qupai (tunes) in use. Dongjing 275px Dongjing uses a type of traditional musical notation called gongchepu. There are traditional dongjing operas, such as Song of the Water Dragon, Waves Washing the Sands and The Sheep on the Hill. Dongjing is a type of ritual music, said to have been sung by Taoist monks in the area. It was introduced at least by the AD 13th century, and is now known only in Yunnan and the distant city of Chengde (in Hebei) and Chifeng (in Inner Mongolia). Dongjing is traditional performed during the Chinese Lunar New Year. The President of the Dayan Naxi Ancient Music Association, Xuan Ke, has claimed that donjing originated from the religious and imperial music of the Tang and Song dynasties . (thus placing its origins between 618 and 1279). This same period saw the developed of ci poetry, which accompanied music led by stringed instruments. By the 1980s, dongjing had mostly died out. It has since been revived, however, and its popularity among the younger generation is rebounding, especially in Chuxiong, Lijiang, Baoshan, Dali and Kunming. The Dayan Naxi Ancient Music Association was formed in 1987 to help revive donjing. Renowned modern performers include Peng Youshan and Lei Hong'an.

History  The history of the County of Nevers is closely connected to the Duchy of Burgundy, from which it was separated in the 11th century. The counts also held the County of Auxerre in the 11th and 12th centuries, and the county was held by the Count of Flanders and then the Duke of Burgundy again in the 14th century. In 1539, it was directly annexed to France and became a duchy in the peerage of France. For a time, it was held by a cadet branch of the House of Gonzaga. This branch inherited the Duchy of Mantua from the senior Gonzaga line (when it became extinct in 1627) and ruled Mantua until 1708, when the branch died out in the male line. Charles IV Gonzaga sold the duchies of Nevers and Rethel in 1659 to Cardinal Mazarin. His family held the duchy of Nevers until the French Revolution.

The album is the only release ever by Killswitch Engage to be released through Ferret, the band would later be signed to Roadrunner Records, where their follow-up LP, Alive or Just Breathing was released. The band's debut is considered to be one of the first ever successful albums in the metalcore genre, garnering a re- release five years after its original pressing. No songs in the album were released as singles. History The song \\"Soilborn\\" was the first song the band ever wrote, which took shape during the band's first jam session together, also mentioned in From the Bedroom to the Basement. The band wrote the entire album's music without a singer, until Jesse Leach of local band Nothing Stays Gold (who were signed to Dutkiewicz's brother Tobias' record label, Tobias also being the singer for Aftershock) joined the band shortly after its formation. Many of the songs were then recorded for a demo, which included \\"Soilborn\\", before the recording of the band's debut full-length. While writing the album, bassist D'Antonio asked Ferret Music if they could sign his band as a favor since D'Antonio illustrated the covers for some of the albums released through the label. Ferret were said to have signed Killswitch Engage mainly because metal was becoming less and less popular at the time, and representatives felt that they might be the last metal band they would ever sign. The tracks \\"Temple from the Within\\" and \\"Vide Infra\\" were re- released for Alive or Just Breathing (2002), while \\"Irreversal\\" was re- recorded for The End of Heartache (2004) and \\"In the Unblind\\" was re-recorded for the Alive or Just Breathing 2005 re-release bonus disc. In 2005,http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/killswitch-engage-2000-mr0000286570 Ferret Music also released a remastered version of the album, with four demo tracks from a 1999 demo, which was originally sold at a show within which Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall and In Flames played together at The Palladium in Worcester, Massachusetts, which apparently sold incredibly well, as said in the documentary feature From the Bedroom to the Basement from the live DVD (Set This) World Ablaze.
