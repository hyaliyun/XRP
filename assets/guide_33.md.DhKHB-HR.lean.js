The missile hit a fishing boat at 8:40 a.m., killing one person and injuring three. Chronology The Chin Chiang PGG-610 () patrol ship was undergoing a regular simulation training exercise for military equipment on the morning of 1 July (Friday) at Zuoying Naval Base in Zuoying District, Kaohsiung. The missile was accidentally launched at 8:00 a.m. during an inspection at the navy base. The missile cruised around for two minutes towards mainland China before hitting a Taiwanese fishing boat. The missile did not explode upon impact. The navy sent a helicopter and navy vessels to the area for damage inspection. The mishap killed the Taiwanese boat's captain and injured its three crew members, from Taiwan, the Philippines and Vietnam. The missile did not cross the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan and mainland China. An investigation of the incident concluded in August 2016. Three ROC naval officers were charged by the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office. The Ministry of Justice announced in November that the family of captain Huang Wen-chung would be paid NT$34.84 million in compensation. The Control Yuan voted against impeachment proceedings for nine naval officers in July 2017. The Kaohsiung District Court issued its first ruling on the case that September, sentencing Petty Officer Second Class Kao Chia-chun to eighteen months imprisonment, Chief Petty Officer Chen Ming-hsiu to 24 months imprisonment, and Lieutenant Junior Grade Hsu Po-wei to fourteen months imprisonment. The Control Yuan held a second vote and began impeachment proceedings against nine naval officers in February 2018. The next month, the Control Yuan advised that communication between the Executive Yuan and Ministry of National Defense be improved. The Kaohsiung bench of the Taiwan High Court reduced Chen Ming-hsiu's sentence to 21 months in June 2018.

The protected areas may be of different types, including strictly protected areas and sustainable use areas, which may be administered at different public levels or privately. They may include areas assigned to indigenous people. A mosaic may be more flexible and effective than an attempt to combine all the areas into a single conservation unit under one agency. In practice, results with mosaics in different countries have been mixed. Definition A conservation mosaic may be defined as \\"a network of protected areas and complementary landscapes that include combinations of national parks (i.e. the core conservation areas), production landscapes and collectively-owned ethnic territories (i.e. the surrounding areas)\\". Conservation mosaics are similar to the biospheres promoted by UNESCO under the Man and the Biosphere Programme. The cooperative approach between different agencies and types of protected area avoids the conflicts and disagreements over land use and conservation that often result with a single agency and single type of conservation unit. The value of creating protected area mosaics has been the subject of intense debate among conservationists. Protected areas are of great importance in protecting biodiversity, but conservation efforts must take into account the social and economic needs of the surrounding communities and the resulting pressure on land usage. National examples =Brazil= BR-319. A protected area mosaic has been defined in an effort to reduce deforestation when the road is paved. A mosaico de unidades de conserva√ß√£o is a legally recognized entity in Brazil, a collection of protected areas of the same or different categories that are near to each other, adjoin each other or overlap, and that should be managed as a whole. It may include conservation units, private lands and indigenous territories. Brazil has created a mosaic of federal and state conservation units along the BR-319 highway through the Amazon rainforest in an effort to better prevent deforestation when the highway is paved through more efficient management of a larger area. However, WWF-Brazil has pointed out that it is not enough to simply create the protected areas on paper. They must be staffed, delimited, legal owners compensated and so on. The Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park in the state of Goi√°s, Brazil, was expanded by Federal Decree in September 2001 and inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in December 2001. In 2003 the expansion was successfully challenged and 72% of the national park lost its protection status. The park is part of the Cerrado Biosphere Reserve. Brazil has outlined plans for a mosaic of new conservation units with different management categories covering an equivalent area to the expanded National Park, but UNESCO has questioned whether the mosaic will be sufficient to ensure the statutory protection required for the World Heritage properties. =Colombia= A 2015 World Bank report on national protected areas in Colombia covering at least found that with the mosaic approach ecological connectivity had improved in eight of the mosaics, exceeding the target. The local farmers and fishing communities in seven of the conservation mosaics, which included protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones, benefited from sustainable provision and use of environmental goods and services. =Kenya= In northern Kenya the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) organisation covers 19 community conservancies with more than of wildlife habitat. The NRT Council of Elders agreed in May 2010 to found the Nakuprat ‚Äì Gotu Community Conservancy beside the Shaba National Reserve and the Ewaso Ng'iro river to promote conflict resolution and conserve nature. The conservancy is part of a protected area mosaic that is a vital habitat for species that include the African elephant and the endangered Gr√©vy's zebra. =United Kingdom= A mosaic of protected areas has evolved in the United Kingdom, with a growing number of types of protected area, some as a result of European Union directives. The objectives of nature conservation and landscape protection are treated as distinct. The mosaic has evolved in a manner that results in duplication of effort and funding. It could benefit from rationalisation and more flexible administration. =United States= The protected area mosaics of the Great Sand Dunes, El Malpais, San Pedro and Las Cienegas areas in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona have been assembled by a variety of government and non-government organisations to protect the environment while respecting land use demands of the southwest of the United States. This broad approach to ecosystem planning and management seems more fair and effective than former single-agency approaches. The Great Sand Dunes Monument Area combined various type of protected area to satisfy the objectives of the National Park Service, The Nature Conservancy and other organizations, and to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem. The result was similar to the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the Yukon in Canada. Implementation was staged, with many interactions and adaptations over time.

Most of these processes take place in a vacuum or with process gases. CVD growth of CNTs can occur in vacuum or at atmospheric pressure. Large quantities of nanotubes can be synthesized by these methods; advances in catalysis and continuous growth are making CNTs more commercially viable.K. Takeuchi, T. Hayashi, Y. A. Kim, K. Fujisawa, M. Endo \\"The state-of- the-art science and applications of carbon nanotubes\\", February 2014, Volume 5, Issue 1, pp 15  Types  = Arc discharge = Nanotubes were observed in 1991 in the carbon soot of graphite electrodes during an arc discharge, by using a current of 100 amps, that was intended to produce fullerenes. However the first macroscopic production of carbon nanotubes was made in 1992 by two researchers at NEC's Fundamental Research Laboratory. The method used was the same as in 1991. During this process, the carbon contained in the negative electrode sublimates because of the high-discharge temperatures. The yield for this method is up to 30% by weight and it produces both single- and multi- walled nanotubes with lengths of up to 50 micrometers with few structural defects. Arc-discharge technique uses higher temperatures (above 1,700 ¬∞C) for CNT synthesis which typically causes the expansion of CNTs with fewer structural defects in comparison with other methods. = Laser ablation = In laser ablation, a pulsed laser vaporizes a graphite target in a high- temperature reactor while an inert gas is bled into the chamber. Nanotubes develop on the cooler surfaces of the reactor as the vaporized carbon condenses. A water-cooled surface may be included in the system to collect the nanotubes. This process was developed by Dr. Richard Smalley and co-workers at Rice University, who at the time of the discovery of carbon nanotubes, were blasting metals with a laser to produce various metal molecules. When they heard of the existence of nanotubes they replaced the metals with graphite to create multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Later that year the team used a composite of graphite and metal catalyst particles (the best yield was from a cobalt and nickel mixture) to synthesize single-walled carbon nanotubes. The laser ablation method yields around 70% and produces primarily single-walled carbon nanotubes with a controllable diameter determined by the reaction temperature. However, it is more expensive than either arc discharge or chemical vapor deposition. The effective equation for few cycle optical pulse dynamics was obtained by virtue of the Boltzmann collision-less equation solution for conduction band electrons of semiconductor carbon nanotubes in the case when medium with carbon nanotubes has spatially-modulated refractive index. = Plasma torch = Single-walled carbon nanotubes can also be synthesized by a thermal plasma method, first invented in 2000 at INRS (Institut national de la recherche scientifique) in Varennes, Canada, by Olivier Smiljanic. In this method, the aim is to reproduce the conditions prevailing in the arc discharge and laser ablation approaches, but a carbon- containing gas is used instead of graphite vapors to supply the necessary carbon. Doing so, the growth of SWNT is more efficient (decomposing the gas can be 10 times less energy-consuming than graphite vaporization). The process is also continuous and low cost. A gaseous mixture of argon, ethylene and ferrocene is introduced into a microwave plasma torch, where it is atomized by the atmospheric pressure plasma, which has the form of an intense 'flame'. The fumes created by the flame contain SWNT, metallic and carbon nanoparticles and amorphous carbon. Another way to produce single-walled carbon nanotubes with a plasma torch is to use the induction thermal plasma method, implemented in 2005 by groups from the University of Sherbrooke and the National Research Council of Canada. The method is similar to arc discharge in that both use ionized gas to reach the high temperature necessary to vaporize carbon- containing substances and the metal catalysts necessary for the ensuing nanotube growth. The thermal plasma is induced by high-frequency oscillating currents in a coil, and is maintained in flowing inert gas. Typically, a feedstock of carbon black and metal catalyst particles is fed into the plasma, and then cooled down to form single-walled carbon nanotubes. Different single- wall carbon nanotube diameter distributions can be synthesized. The induction thermal plasma method can produce up to 2 grams of nanotube material per minute, which is higher than the arc discharge or the laser ablation methods. = Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) = Nanotubes being grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition The catalytic vapor phase deposition of carbon was reported in 1952 and 1959, but it was not until 1993 that carbon nanotubes were formed by this process. In 2007, researchers at the University of Cincinnati (UC) developed a process to grow aligned carbon nanotube arrays of length 18 mm on a FirstNano ET3000 carbon nanotube growth system. During CVD, a substrate is prepared with a layer of metal catalyst particles, most commonly nickel, cobalt, iron, or a combination. The metal nanoparticles can also be produced by other ways, including reduction of oxides or oxides solid solutions. The diameters of the nanotubes that are to be grown are related to the size of the metal particles. This can be controlled by patterned (or masked) deposition of the metal, annealing, or by plasma etching of a metal layer. The substrate is heated to approximately 700 ¬∞C. To initiate the growth of nanotubes, two gases are bled into the reactor: a process gas (such as ammonia, nitrogen or hydrogen) and a carbon-containing gas (such as acetylene, ethylene, ethanol or methane). Nanotubes grow at the sites of the metal catalyst; the carbon-containing gas is broken apart at the surface of the catalyst particle, and the carbon is transported to the edges of the particle, where it forms the nanotubes. This mechanism is still being studied. The catalyst particles can stay at the tips of the growing nanotube during growth, or remain at the nanotube base, depending on the adhesion between the catalyst particle and the substrate. Thermal catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon has become an active area of research and can be a promising route for the bulk production of CNTs. Fluidised bed reactor is the most widely used reactor for CNT preparation. Scale-up of the reactor is the major challenge. CVD is the most widely used method for the production of carbon nanotubes. For this purpose, the metal nanoparticles are mixed with a catalyst support such as MgO or Al2O3 to increase the surface area for higher yield of the catalytic reaction of the carbon feedstock with the metal particles. One issue in this synthesis route is the removal of the catalyst support via an acid treatment, which sometimes could destroy the original structure of the carbon nanotubes. However, alternative catalyst supports that are soluble in water have proven effective for nanotube growth. If a plasma is generated by the application of a strong electric field during growth (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition), then the nanotube growth will follow the direction of the electric field. By adjusting the geometry of the reactor it is possible to synthesize vertically aligned carbon nanotubesSEM images & TEM images of carbon nanotubes, aligned carbon nanotube arrays, and nanoparticles. Nano- lab.com. (i.e., perpendicular to the substrate), a morphology that has been of interest to researchers interested in electron emission from nanotubes. Without the plasma, the resulting nanotubes are often randomly oriented. Under certain reaction conditions, even in the absence of a plasma, closely spaced nanotubes will maintain a vertical growth direction resulting in a dense array of tubes resembling a carpet or forest. Of the various means for nanotube synthesis, CVD shows the most promise for industrial-scale deposition, because of its price/unit ratio, and because CVD is capable of growing nanotubes directly on a desired substrate, whereas the nanotubes must be collected in the other growth techniques. The growth sites are controllable by careful deposition of the catalyst. In 2007, a team from Meijo University demonstrated a high-efficiency CVD technique for growing carbon nanotubes from camphor. Researchers at Rice University, until recently led by the late Richard Smalley, have concentrated upon finding methods to produce large, pure amounts of particular types of nanotubes. Their approach grows long fibers from many small seeds cut from a single nanotube; all of the resulting fibers were found to be of the same diameter as the original nanotube and are expected to be of the same type as the original nanotube.  Super-growth CVD  Super- growth CVD (water-assisted chemical vapor deposition) was developed by Kenji Hata, Sumio Iijima and co-workers at AIST, Japan. In this process, the activity and lifetime of the catalyst are enhanced by addition of water into the CVD reactor. Dense millimeter-tall vertically aligned nanotube arrays (VANTAs) or \\"forests\\", aligned normal to the substrate, were produced. The forests height could be expressed, as : H(t) = {beta}{tau}_o ({1 - e^{-t / {tau}_o}}). In this equation, Œ≤ is the initial growth rate and {tau}_o is the characteristic catalyst lifetime. Their specific surface exceeds 1,000 m2/g (capped) or 2,200 m2/g (uncapped), surpassing the value of 400‚Äì1,000 m2/g for HiPco samples. The synthesis efficiency is about 100 times higher than for the laser ablation method. The time required to make SWNT forests of the height of 2.5 mm by this method was 10 minutes in 2004. Those SWNT forests can be easily separated from the catalyst, yielding clean SWNT material (purity >99.98%) without further purification. For comparison, the as-grown HiPco CNTs contain about 5‚Äì35% of metal impurities; it is therefore purified through dispersion and centrifugation that damages the nanotubes. Super-growth avoids this problem. Patterned highly organized single-walled nanotube structures were successfully fabricated using the super-growth technique. The mass density of super-growth CNTs is about 0.037 g/cm3. It is much lower than that of conventional CNT powders (~1.34 g/cm3), probably because the latter contain metals and amorphous carbon. The super-growth method is basically a variation of CVD. Therefore, it is possible to grow material containing SWNT, DWNTs and MWNTs, and to alter their ratios by tuning the growth conditions. Their ratios change by the thinness of the catalyst. Many MWNTs are included so that the diameter of the tube is wide. The vertically aligned nanotube forests originate from a \\"zipping effect\\" when they are immersed in a solvent and dried. The zipping effect is caused by the surface tension of the solvent and the van der Waals forces between the carbon nanotubes. It aligns the nanotubes into a dense material, which can be formed in various shapes, such as sheets and bars, by applying weak compression during the process. Densification increases the Vickers hardness by about 70 times and density is 0.55 g/cm3. The packed carbon nanotubes are more than 1 mm long and have a carbon purity of 99.9% or higher; they also retain the desirable alignment properties of the nanotubes forest. = Liquid electrolysis method = In 2015, researchers in the George Washington University discovered a new pathway to synthesize MWCNTs by electrolysis of molten carbonates. The mechanism is similar to CVD. Some metal ions were reduced to a metal form and attached on the cathode as the nucleation point for the growing of CNTs. The reaction on the cathode is :Li2CO3 -> Li2O + CNTs + O2 The formed lithium oxide can in-situ absorb carbon dioxide (if present) and form lithium carbonate, as shown in the equation. :Li2O + CO2 -> Li2CO3 Thus the net reaction is :CO2 -> CNTs + O2 In other words, the reactant is only greenhouse gas of carbon dioxide, while the product is high valued CNTs. This discovery was highlighted by Science, BBC news, MIT technology news, etc., as a possible technology for carbon dioxide capture and conversions. = Natural, incidental, and controlled flame environments = Fullerenes and carbon nanotubes are not necessarily products of high-tech laboratories; they are commonly formed in such mundane places as ordinary flames, produced by burning methane, ethylene, and benzene, and they have been found in soot from both indoor and outdoor air. However, these naturally occurring varieties can be highly irregular in size and quality because the environment in which they are produced is often highly uncontrolled. Thus, although they can be used in some applications, they can lack in the high degree of uniformity necessary to satisfy the many needs of both research and industry. Recent efforts have focused on producing more uniform carbon nanotubes in controlled flame environments. Such methods have promise for large-scale, low-cost nanotube synthesis based on theoretical models, though they must compete with rapidly developing large scale CVD production.  Purification  ultracentrifugation. = Removal of catalysts = Nanoscale metal catalysts are important ingredients for fixed- and fluidized-bed CVD synthesis of CNTs. They allow increasing the growth efficiency of CNTs and may give control over their structure and chirality. During synthesis, catalysts can convert carbon precursors into tubular carbon structures but can also form encapsulating carbon overcoats. Together with metal oxide supports they may therefore attach to or become incorporated into the CNT product. The presence of metal impurities can be problematic for many applications. Especially catalyst metals like nickel, cobalt or yttrium may be of toxicological concern. While unencapsulated catalyst metals may be readily removable by acid washing, encapsulated ones require oxidative treatment for opening their carbon shell. The effective removal of catalysts, especially of encapsulated ones, while preserving the CNT structure is a challenge and has been addressed in many studies. A new approach to break carbonaceous catalyst encapsulations is based on rapid thermal annealing.  Application-related issues  Many electronic applications of carbon nanotubes crucially rely on techniques of selectively producing either semiconducting or metallic CNTs, preferably of a certain chirality. Several methods of separating semiconducting and metallic CNTs are known, but most of them are not yet suitable for large-scale technological processes. The most efficient method relies on density-gradient ultracentrifugation, which separates surfactant- wrapped nanotubes by the minute difference in their density. This density difference often translates into difference in the nanotube diameter and (semi)conducting properties. Another method of separation uses a sequence of freezing, thawing, and compression of SWNTs embedded in agarose gel. This process results in a solution containing 70% metallic SWNTs and leaves a gel containing 95% semiconducting SWNTs. The diluted solutions separated by this method show various colors. The separated carbon nanotubes using this method have been applied to electrodes, e.g. electric double-layer capacitor. Moreover, SWNTs can be separated by the column chromatography method. Yield is 95% in semiconductor type SWNT and 90% in metallic type SWNT. In addition to separation of semiconducting and metallic SWNTs, it is possible to sort SWNTs by length, diameter, and chirality. The highest resolution length sorting, with length variation of <10%, has thus far been achieved by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of DNA-dispersed carbon nanotubes (DNA-SWNT). SWNT diameter separation has been achieved by density-gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) using surfactant-dispersed SWNTs and by ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) for DNA-SWNT. Purification of individual chiralities has also been demonstrated with IEC of DNA-SWNT: specific short DNA oligomers can be used to isolate individual SWNT chiralities. Thus far, 12 chiralities have been isolated at purities ranging from 70% for (8,3) and (9,5) SWNTs to 90% for (6,5), (7,5) and (10,5)SWNTs. Alternatively, carbon nanotubes have been successfully sorted by chirality using the aqueous two phase extraction method. There have been successful efforts to integrate these purified nanotubes into devices, e. g. FETs. An alternative to separation is development of a selective growth of semiconducting or metallic CNTs. Recently, a new CVD recipe that involves a combination of ethanol and methanol gases and quartz substrates resulting in horizontally aligned arrays of 95‚Äì98% semiconducting nanotubes was announced. Nanotubes are usually grown on nanoparticles of magnetic metal (Fe, Co), which facilitates production of electronic (spintronic) devices. In particular, control of current through a field-effect transistor by magnetic field has been demonstrated in such a single-tube nanostructure.

Fullerenes A review of works on fullerene toxicity by Lalwani et al. found little evidence that C60 is toxic.G. Lalwani and B. Sitharaman, Multifunctional fullerene and metallofullerene based nanobiomaterials, NanoLIFE 08/2013; 3:1342003. DOI: 10.1142/S1793984413420038 Full Text PDF The toxicity of these carbon nanoparticles varies with dose, duration, type (e.g., C60, C70, M@C60, M@C82), functional groups used to water-solubilize these nanoparticles (e.g., OH, COOH), and method of administration (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal). The authors recommended that the pharmacology of each fullerene- or metallofullerene-based complex be assessed as a different compound. Moussa et al. (1996‚Äì97) studied the in vivo toxicity of C60 after intra-peritoneal administration of large doses. No evidence of toxicity was found and the mice tolerated a dose of 5 g/kg of body weight. Mori et al. (2006) could not find toxicity in rodents for C60 and C70 mixtures after oral administration of a dose of 2 g/kg body weight and did not observe evidence of genotoxic or mutagenic potential in vitro. Other studies could not establish the toxicity of fullerenes: on the contrary, the work of Gharbi et al. (2005) suggested that aqueous C60 suspensions failing to produce acute or subacute toxicity in rodents could also protect their livers in a dose- dependent manner against free-radical damage. In a 2012 primary study of an olive oil / C60 suspension administered to rats by intra-peritoneal administration or oral gavage, a prolonged lifespan to almost double the normal lifespan of the rats was seen and significant toxicity was not observed. An investigator for this study, Professor Moussa, generalized from its findings in a video interview and stated that pure C60 is not toxic. When considering toxicological data, care must be taken to distinguish as necessary between what are normally referred to as fullerenes: (C60, C70, ...); fullerene derivatives: C60 or other fullerenes with covalently bonded chemical groups; fullerene complexes (e.g., water-solubilized with surfactants, such as C60-PVP; host‚Äìguest complexes, such as with cyclodextrin), where the fullerene is supermolecular bound to another molecule; C60 nanoparticles, which are extended solid-phase aggregates of C60 crystallites; and nanotubes, which are generally much larger (in terms of molecular weight and size) molecules, and are different in shape to the spheroidal fullerenes C60 and C70, as well as having different chemical and physical properties. The molecules above are all fullerenes (close-caged all-carbon molecules) but it is unreliable to extrapolate results from C60 to nanotubes or vice versa, as they range from insoluble materials in either hydrophilic or lipophilic media, to hydrophilic, lipophilic, or even amphiphilic molecules, and with other varying physical and chemical properties. A quantitative structural analysis relationship (QSAR) study can analyze on how close the molecules under consideration are in physical and chemical properties, can help. Carbon nanotubes alveolar epithelial cell. As of 2013, the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health was not aware of any reports of adverse health effects in workers using or producing carbon nanotubes or carbon nanofibers. However a systematic review of 54 laboratory animal studies indicated that they could cause adverse pulmonary effects including inflammation, granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis, which were of similar or greater potency when compared with other known fibrogenic materials such as silica, asbestos, and ultrafine carbon black. With reference to nanotubes, a 2008 study on carbon nanotubes introduced into the abdominal cavity of mice led the authors to suggest comparisons to \\"asbestos-like pathogenicity\\". This was not an inhalation study, though there have been several performed in the past, therefore it is premature to conclude that nanotubes should be considered to have a toxicological profile similar to asbestos. Conversely, and perhaps illustrative of how the various classes of molecules which fall under the general term fullerene cover a wide range of properties, Sayes et al. found that in vivo inhalation of C60(OH)24 and nano-C60 in rats gave no effect, whereas in comparison quartz particles produced an inflammatory response under the same conditions. As stated above, nanotubes are quite different in chemical and physical properties to C60, i.e., molecular weight, shape, size, physical properties (such as solubility) all are very different, so from a toxicological standpoint, different results for C60 and nanotubes are not suggestive of any discrepancy in the findings. A 2016 study reported on workers in a large-scale MWCNT manufacturing facility in Russia with relatively high occupational exposure levels, finding that exposure to MWCNTs caused significant increase in several inflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers for interstitial lung disease. = Toxicity = The toxicity of carbon nanotubes has been an important question in nanotechnology. As of 2007, such research had just begun. The data is still fragmentary and subject to criticism. Preliminary results highlight the difficulties in evaluating the toxicity of this heterogeneous material. Parameters such as structure, size distribution, surface area, surface chemistry, surface charge, and agglomeration state as well as purity of the samples, have considerable impact on the reactivity of carbon nanotubes. However, available data clearly show that, under some conditions, nanotubes can cross membrane barriers, which suggests that, if raw materials reach the organs, they can induce harmful effects such as inflammatory and fibrotic reactions.  Effects Characterization  In 2014, experts from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) assessed the carcinogenicity of CNTs, including SWCNTs and MWCNTs. No human epidemiologic or cancer data was available to the IARC Working Group at the time, so the evaluation focused on the results of in vivo animal studies assessing the carcinogenicity of SWCNTs and MWCNTs in rodents. The Working Group concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the specific MWCNT type \\"MWCNT-7\\", limited evidence for the two other types of MWCNTs with dimensions similar to MWCNT-7, and inadequate evidence for SWCNTs. Therefore, it was agreed to specifically classify MWCNT-7 as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) while the other forms of CNT, namely SWCNT and other types of MWCNT, excluding MWCNT-7, were considered not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3) due to a lack of coherent evidence. Results of rodent studies collectively show that regardless of the process by which CNTs were synthesized and the types and amounts of metals they contained, CNTs were capable of producing inflammation, epithelioid granulomas (microscopic nodules), fibrosis, and biochemical/toxicological changes in the lungs.Zumwalde, Ralph and Laura Hodson (March 2009). \\"Approaches to Safe Nanotechnology: Managing the Health and Safety Concerns Associated with Engineered Nanomaterials\\". National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. NIOSH (DHHS) Publication 2009-125. Comparative toxicity studies in which mice were given equal weights of test materials showed that SWCNTs were more toxic than quartz, which is considered a serious occupational health hazard when chronically inhaled. As a control, ultrafine carbon black was shown to produce minimal lung responses. Carbon nanotubes deposit in the alveolar ducts by aligning lengthwise with the airways; the nanotubes will often combine with metals. The needle-like fiber shape of CNTs is similar to asbestos fibers. This raises the idea that widespread use of carbon nanotubes may lead to pleural mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lungs, or peritoneal mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the abdomen (both caused by exposure to asbestos). A recently published pilot study supports this prediction. Scientists exposed the mesothelial lining of the body cavity of mice to long multiwalled carbon nanotubes and observed asbestos-like, length- dependent, pathogenic behavior that included inflammation and formation of lesions known as granulomas. Authors of the study conclude: Although further research is required, the available data suggest that under certain conditions, especially those involving chronic exposure, carbon nanotubes can pose a serious risk to human health.  Exposure Characterization  Exposure scenarios are important to consider when trying to determine toxicity and the risks associated with these diverse and difficult to study materials. Exposure studies have been conducted over the past several years in an effort to determine where and how likely exposures will be. Since CNTs are being incorporated into composite materials for their ability to strengthen materials while not adding significant weight, the manufacture of CNTs and composites or hybrids including CNTs, the subsequent processing of the articles and equipment made from the composites, and end of life processes such as recycling or incineration all represent potential sources of exposure. The potential for exposure to the end user is not as likely, however as CNTs are being incorporated into new products there may be more research needed.Nowack, Bernd; David, Raymond M.; Fissan, Heinz; Morris, Howard; Shatkin, Jo Anne; Stintz, Michael; Zepp, Richard; Brouwer, Derk. \\"Potential release scenarios for carbon nanotubes used in composites\\". Environment International. 59: 1‚Äì11. doi:10.1016/j.envint.2013.04.003 One study performed personal and area sampling at seven different plants mostly involving the manufacture of MWCNTs. This study found that the work processes that prompt nanoparticle, not necessarily just CNT release, include \\"spraying, CNT preparation, ultrasonic dispersion, wafer heating, and opening the water bath cover.\\" The exposure concentrations for both personal and area sampling indicated most workers' exposure was well below that set by the ACGIH for carbon black.Lee, Ji Hyun; Lee, Seung-Bok; Bae, Gwi Nam; Jeon, Ki Soo; Yoon, Jin Uk; Ji, Jun Ho; Sung, Jae Hyuck; Lee, Byung Gyu; Lee, Jong Han (2010-04-01). \\"Exposure assessment of carbon nanotube manufacturing workplaces\\".

Processing composite materials presents potential for exposure during cutting, drilling, or abrasion. Two different composite types were laboratory tested during processing under differing conditions to determine potential releases. Samples were machined using one dry cutting process and one wet cutting process with measurements taken at the source and in the breathing zone. The composites tested varied by method of manufacture and components. One was graphite and epoxy layered with CNTs aligned within and the other was a woven alumina with aligned CNTs on the surface. Dry cutting of both proved to be of concern regarding concentrations measured at the breathing zone, while wet cutting, a preferred method, showed a much better method of controlling potential exposures during this type of processing.Bello, Dhimiter; Wardle, Brian L.; Yamamoto, Namiko; deVilloria, Roberto Guzman; Garcia, Enrique J.; Hart, Anastasios J.; Ahn, Kwangseog; Ellenbecker, Michael J.; Hallock, Marilyn (2009-01-01). \\"Exposure to nanoscale particles and fibers during machining of hybrid advanced composites containing carbon nanotubes\\".

Another study provided breathing zone and area sampling results from fourteen sites working with CNTs in a variety of manners for potential exposure assessment. These sites included the manufacture of CNTs, hybrid producers/users, and secondary manufacturers in either the electronics industry or composites industry. The highest mean exposures found in breathing zone samples were found in the secondary manufactures of electronics, then composites and hybrid sites, while the lowest mean exposures were found at the primary manufacturers sites. Relatively few of the samples returned results higher than the recommended exposure level as published by NIOSH.Dahm, Matthew M.; Schubauer-Berigan, Mary K.; Evans, Douglas E.; Birch, M. Eileen; Fernback, Joseph E.; Deddens, James A. (2015-07-01). \\"Carbon Nanotube and Nanofiber Exposure Assessments: An Analysis of 14 Site Visits\\".

While there are developing strategies for the use of CNTs in a variety of products, potentials for exposures thus far appear to be low in most occupational settings. This may change as new products and manufacturing methods or secondary processing advances; therefore risk assessments should be integral to any planning for new applications. = Epidemiology and Risk Management =  Summary of Epidemiology Studies  Currently, there is a lack of epidemiological evidence linking exposure to CNT to human health effects. To date, there have been only a handful of published epidemiological studies that have solely examined the health effects related to the exposure of CNT, while several other studies are currently underway and yet to be published. With the limited amount of human data, scientists are more reliant on the results of current animal toxicity studies to predict adverse health effects, as well as applying what is already known about exposures to other fibrous materials such as asbestos or fine and ultra-fine particulates. This limitation of human data has led to the use of the precautionary principle, which urges workplaces to limit exposure levels to CNT as low as possibly achievable in the absence of known health effects data. Epidemiology studies of nanomaterials thus far have considered a variety of nanomaterials. Few have been specific to CNTs and each has considered a small sample size. These studies have found some relationships between biological markers and MWCNT exposure. One cross-sectional study to evaluate health effects was conducted to determine associations of biomarkers in relation to measured CNT exposure. While no effect on lung function due to exposure was found, the study did observe some indications of early signs of effects to biomarkers associated with exposure to MWCNTs. Additionally, some results were contradictory to earlier in vitro studies making further studies necessary to further define effects.Liou, Saou-Hsing; Tsai, Candace S. J.; Pelclova, Daniela; Schubauer- Berigan, Mary K.; Schulte, Paul A. (2015-10-01). \\"Assessing the first wave of epidemiological studies of nanomaterial workers\\". Journal of Nanoparticle Research. 17 (10): 413. doi:10.1007/s11051-015-3219-7. ISSN 1388-0764.  NIOSH Risk Assessment Summary  NIOSH has undertaken a risk assessment based on available studies to determine appropriate recommendations of exposure levels. Their review found that while human health effects had not been directly observed, there were animal studies that showed potential for health effects that could reasonably be expected in humans upon sufficient exposure. In addition to animal studies, human cell studies were reviewed and determined that harmful effects were expressed. Ultimately, the risk assessment found the most relevant data upon which to calculate the REL were animal studies. Corrections for inter-species differences, and updates to reflect advancing technologies in sampling methods and detection capabilities were considered as a part of the risk assessment. The resultant REL is several orders of magnitude smaller than those of other carbonaceous particulate matters of concern, graphite and carbon black.  Risk Management  To date, several international government agencies, as well as individual authors, have developed occupational exposure limits (OEL) to reduce the risk of any possible human health effects associated with workplace exposures to CNT. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a risk assessment using animal and other toxicological data relevant to assessing the potential non-malignant adverse respiratory effects of CNT and proposed an OEL of 1 Œºg/m3 elemental carbon as a respirable mass 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) concentration. Several individual authors have also performed similar risk assessments using animal toxicity data and have established inhalation exposure limits ranging from 2.5 to 50 ug/m3. One such risk assessment used two data from two different types of exposures to work toward an OEL as part of an adaptive management where there is an expectation that recommendations will be reevaluated as more data become available. = Safety and Exposure Prevention = Occupational exposures that could potentially allow the inhalation of CNT is of the greatest concern, especially in situations where the CNT is handled in powder form which can easily be aerosolized and inhaled. Also of concern are any high-energy processes that are applied to various CNT preparations such as the mixing or sonication of CNT in liquids as well as processes that cut or drill into CNT based composites in downstream products. These types of high-energy processes will aerosolize CNT which can then be inhaled. Guidance for minimizing exposure and risk to CNT have been published by several international agencies which includes several documents from the British Health and Safety Executive titled \\"Using nanomaterials at work Including carbon nanotubes and other bio- persistent high aspect ratio nanomaterials\\" and the \\"Risk Management of Carbon Nanotubes\\" Safe Work Australia has also published guidance titled \\"Safe Handling and use of Carbon Nanotubes\\" which describes two approaches to managing the risks that include risk management with detailed hazard analysis and exposure assessment as well as risk management by using Control Banding. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has also published a document titled \\"Current Intelligence Bulletin 65: Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers\\" describes strategies for controlling workplace exposures and implementing a medical surveillance program. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has published a \\"OSHA Fact Sheet, Working Safety with Nanomaterials\\" for use as guidance in addition to a webpage hosting a variety of resources. These guidance documents generally advocate instituting the principles of the Hierarchy of Hazard Control which is a system used in industry to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards. The hazard controls in the hierarchy are, in order of decreasing effectiveness: * Elimination of a potential exposure. * Substitution with a less hazardous chemical or process. * Engineering Controls such as ventilation systems, shielding, or enclosures. * Administrative Controls including training, policies, written procedures, work schedules, etc. * Personal Protective Equipment References Further reading * NIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletin 65: Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers Fullerenes Toxicology ","title":"Toxicology of carbon nanomaterials"},{"id":"51069177","title":"Meta Antenen"},{"id":"51069207","text":"The was an infantry division of the Imperial Japanese Army.

The Can-Am then announced it was merging into the American Arena League with the Bucks one of the inaugural members for the 2018 season. By January 31, 2018, the original Vermont Bucks folded after an ownership change. Another ownership group then acquired the brand and launched a semi- professional team in 2019, but did not have a home arena. They joined the Southern Steam's Elite Indoor Football for the 2020 season with games at Collins-Perley Sports Complex in St. Albans, Vermont. History The Bucks were announced as an expansion team on July 8, 2016, as part of the 2017 season in American Indoor Football (AIF). However, the league then folded on July 18, 2016. Bucks owner Tim Viens, a businessman, former Camping World Truck Series auto racer and placekicker at Glenville State College, began negotiations with the Arena Developmental League and the proposed Supreme Indoor Football (both of which are based in the southeastern United States) about joining for the 2017 season. In August 2016, the Can-Am Indoor Football League was created and listed the Bucks as one of its inaugural teams; the CAN-AM League features teams centered mostly in the northeastern U.S. The Bucks won all but one game in the Can-Am league, their lone loss coming to the Boston Blaze, a traveling team that Tim Viens also owned. Both the Bucks and the Blaze then were scheduled to meet in the Eastern Division championship, however, Viens then announced the Bucks would play the non-league semi- professional Central Penn Chargers for the division title. The Bucks would defeat the Chargers 46‚Äì6 to meet the undefeated Rochester Kings in the Can-Am championship. The Bucks then beat the undefeated Kings in Rochester by a score of 61‚Äì41. Viens announced via Facebook in April 2017 that the team was in negotiations with another league for the 2018 season; he announced that Arena Pro Football and the Can-Am would merge for 2018 to create the American Arena League (AAL). After the 2017 season, Viens launched another team in the AAL called the Atlanta Havoc. He then sold the Bucks to an ownership group composed of Thomas Sturgis and Kyle Jennings of Exeter, New Hampshire, and Ron Lotti of Boston. However, in January 2018, the new ownership notified the AAL they would not participate in the 2018 season. In June 2018, an organization called Vermont Bucks Professional Arena Football, LLC began attempts at fundraising and a return for a semi-professional team in 2019. They were announced as team in the developmental New England Arena League (NEAL), a league that plays all its games in one location near Boston, for the 2019 season. After one season, the Bucks announced they were joining Elite Indoor Football (EIF), another semi-professional league, for 2020 with three or four homes games at Collins-Perley Sports Complex in St. Albans, Vermont.

She was the daughter of the burger T√∂nnies Antonius Br√∂ijer, mayor of Viborg in Swedish Finland. She married in 1640 to merchant T√∂nnies Antonius Br√∂ijer (d. 1652) who was engaged in commodity trading. As was usual in Sweden at the time, kept her own surname after her marriage In 1647, her father was ennobled with the surname Rosenbr√∂ijer. She took her father's new surname and became known as Agneta Rosenbr√∂ijer. Widowed in 1652, she took over the trading business of her late spouse. In 1655, she married the recently ennobled captain Peter von Gertten (d. 1671). After marriage, he left for six years to serve in the Polish‚ÄìSwedish wars. After his return in 1661, the couple attracted attention with their extravagant life style and belonged to the leading people of the city. They bought the manor Ahij√§rvi in 1663 to live in accordance with their noble status, while she continued to manage the trading business. It was an important business and belonged to the few in Viborg at that time to trade with foreign nations. After the death of her second spouse in 1671, Agneta Rosenbr√∂ijer was dragged in to a fourteen year long period of law suits: she was forced to pay of the debts accumulated by her spouse and herself during all their years of extravagance, while she herself sued the state and demanded to be given the salary of her late spouse to pay of the creditors. Her situation was worsened through the reduction of 1683. In 1685, finally, the king granted her the income from a couple of farms for her personal support.

Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Instead of picking one serialized element and providing some kind of conclusion or any answer, this finale introduces even more new questions. Sure, Nick's mom being alive can be construed as kind of an answer to Nick's sudden interest in his parents' murder case that started a few weeks ago with Juliette as instigator and lead investigator. But really it just opens a door to tons of new queries, none of which the show seems interested in committing to, since we still have no idea what Renard is, what kind of hierarchy is in place, who the Reapers are, or any of the other overarching mythology. Grimm is now densely layered, with the Portland cases, Nick's past and his parents murder, and international Wesen issues building outwards, but in shooting for a big, ambitious design, the small things are getting lost in the shuffle.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"If there is one gripe I have about tonight's episode it's the time limit. So much of the episode felt rushed, as we hurried from one character to the next, and from one quick burst of story to the next, and if given room to breathe, the plot might have been better served. It felt like Akira, Renard, Adalind, and Team Nick all got pushed to the side for the big reveal of Mama Burkhardt. There's nothing wrong with that, but there was just too much to tell and not enough allotted time to do it.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind wrote, \\"A lot of good stuff got introduced in 'The Woman in Black', stuff that I have the fullest confidence in saying will pan out beautifully in season two, but the finale was a missed opportunity, to me. It could have been a major revelation, an episode that laid all the cards out on the table, but instead, we have a confession that didn't really count, a reveal that was good (but not great), and a one-note villain that only left the most ancillary of bodies in his wake.\\" References External links Grimm (season 1) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Woman in Black (Grimm)"},{"id":"51069329","text":"The was an infantry division of the Imperial Japanese Army.

The group recorded one single, the Beatlesque \\"Taxi\\", which had been a regional success and remains a highly-collectible piece in its original format. Live favorites of the Washington teen scene, the Chargers recorded three additional compositions in preparation for a follow-up release, but went unreleased. Get Hip Records has issued those songs years later when the band's music resurfaced. History With the three-year surge of popularity of the Beatles, Larry Roller (lead vocals), Tony Morgan (drums, vocals), and Curt Dorey (bass guitar, vocals) formed the three-piece version of the Chargers in 1966, which began as a cover band playing renditions of the Fab Four's songs. In need of a lead guitarist, the group enlisted Steve Barone of the Hustlers, who they had competed against in a battle of the bands. Although Roller was praised as a capable lead singer, he was dismissed from the Chargers for not sharing payments to purchase musical equipment. Plucking members from the local group the Undertakers, the Chargers completed their line-up with the inclusion of Ron Kinscherf (rhythm guitar), Don Sandstrom (vocals), and Steve Nelson (keyboards). Progressing in the same vein as early pop-oriented Beatles music, all five members contributed to the group's bright vocal harmonies. Another garage band hailing from Wenatchee was Billy and the Kids, a group of pre-teens who recorded the two singles \\"Say You Love Me\\" and \\"When I See You\\". A rivalry between the two bands fueled each other's popularity, dividing Wenatchee's \\"town loyalty\\" between the west side (The Chargers) and the east side (Billy and the Kids). The Chargers, however useful the rivalry was, had a much more expansive touring territory than their competitors, performing in Yakima, Bridgeport, Spokane for any teen gathering the group could manage. Late in 1966, the band was victorious in a talent show at Pioneer High School, earning first-placed prize: a recording session with Julian Records. Almost immediately thereafter, the group traveled to Spokane to cut their debut single with record producer Don Bernier. Of the two self-penned songs on the record, the Chargers selected Nelson's Beatlesque \\"Taxi\\", a tune about excusing oneself from a failed relationship. On the flip-side, Barone hastily assembled \\"I'm So Alone\\", a pre-Chargers ballad he had presented to him by guitarist Carl Hunt in 1964. Upon release, \\"Taxi\\" was well-covered in Washington, and became a number three hit on the regional radio charts. In 1968, after experiencing the endeavors of recording a single and the success that came in its wake, the band began writing new songs, many of which they scrapped before re-entering the studios. Of the compositions thought suitable for recording, three were selected: \\"Need Your Love\\", \\"You Got a Hold\\", and \\"In the News in General\\". Speaking about the songs, music historian Chris Bishop attributed the distinctive catchiness to \\"heavy tom-tom opening, fine organ playing and interesting rhythm changes\\". However, before the recording could be settled on a follow-up single, the Chargers were forced to disband as a consequence of their management insufficiently supervising funds, causing them to go broke in 1969. Relatively unnoticed outside of Washington, the Chargers have made a resurgence as a result of collectors' interest in the \\"Taxi\\" single, which fetches high-price purchases on the market. The song has appeared on the Garage Punk Unknowns album series, and \\"I'm So Alone\\" is featured on Teenage Shutdown! I'm Down Today, which also displays a photo of the band on the cover. In 2013, Get Hip Records released the three 1968 songs along with \\"Taxi\\" on an EP titled Four by the Chargers. The Chargers have also arranged two reunions since the 2010s.

The property is owned by Dr Shane Moran through his luxury seniors living and aged care group Provectus Care Pty Ltd. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The Georgian-style Old Colonial sandstone building incorporates parts of an original to dwelling house, the existing sandstone house was constructed in 1842 under the ownership of Joseph Farris. The name of the house, which originated from the local community in the 1800s, is derived from the original land grant by Governor Darling. Darling House holds particular historical, social and architectural significance due to its influence on the history and early social development of Millers Point and early colonial Australia and as a representative example of Georgian style architecture in neo-colonial Australia. Darling House is distinctive as one of only a few remaining free standing dwellings in the area and rarer still for its generous curtilage in the form of landscaped gardens.  History  Millers Point is one of the earliest areas of European settlement in Australia, and a focus for maritime activities. This building has been newly renovated and, with new addition, has become a nursing home. = Pre-European and early history = Originally known by the Aboriginal names of Tar-ra and Tullagalla, Dawes Point was later renamed after Lieutenant William Dawes (1762 - 1836), astronomer with the First Fleet. Before white settlement the area was home to the Cadigal (also spelled Gadigal) aboriginal tribe. holds historical significance as it was the site of the first guns mounted in Sydney in 1788, as well as the Dawes Point Battery, Sydney's first cemetery and the site of Sydney's first port facilities. The area is also commonly referred to as Millers Point or The Rocks. European activity around Millers Point and Dawes Point commenced with the beginning of Sydney's history, in 1788. There appear to be no actual structures on Millers Point until slightly later - as can be seen from plans dated to 1788, 1792, 1802 and 1807. Though Dawes Point boasted an observatory built by Lieutenant William Dawes as early as 1788 and \\"Dawes Battery\\" was established next to it. By 1812 there was a wind-powered post mill behind the battery, owned by Nathaniel Lucas, which was then sold, with the surrounding land, to John Leighton (also known as Jack the Miller) in 1814. Between this time and 1822, there were three windmills in the area probably both owned and run by Leighton and hence this part of Sydney Harbour came to be known as Millers Point. Apart from the windmills, it seems that there was also a slaughterhouse run in Dawes Point, probably by Tom Cribb. The rocky terrain of the peninsula made the area unappealing for residential structures as only Lower Fort Street, at this point unnamed, could allow vehicular access to the area. The area was quarried in 1823 and by 1830 there were six quarrying parties whose work contributed to the cut for the future Argyle and Kent Streets which in turn made the whole area more accessible and allowed for residential development. With the development of steam milling and the abandonment of the old windmills, the area turned to maritime trades and many wharves and warehouses were established. With the increasing number of wealthy merchants and wharf owners moving into Millers Point and Dawes Point, Lower Fort Street began to develop as an area with \\"respectable dwelling houses\\" as commented by Maclehose in 1839. = Original dwelling -1835 = Dawes Point 1840s looking north (with Darling House in centre), watercolour by Joseph Fowels, State Library of NSWThe land upon which Darling House now stands was granted to Susanna Ward by Governor Darling in 1823 and in 1831 was transferred to Ms Susanna Elizabeth Douglas. Prior to the construction of any buildings, the site had been used as a sandstone quarry and it is from this quarry that the convict hand carved sandstone blocks from which the house is built are likely to have been quarried. The first building on the site is assumed to have been a stone building constructed during the early to mid-1830s. This can be deduced from the transfer of land in 1937 from Susanna Douglas to Michael Gannon which includes a reference to buildings having already been present (as well as the relatively sharp rise in the cost of the land from ¬£101 in 1837 to ¬£200 in 1839). It also seems that the second house, being the current sandstone building now standing on the site was built over the original building and was constructed during the depression of the early 1840s. Darling House incorporates some of the original foundations, retaining walls, stonework, cobbled paving and part of a brick cavity wall from the original early 1830s building and parts of the building are assumed to date from this earlier c.1833 to c.1835 period.Elements uncovered during restoration works in 2016 to 2018. There are no surviving mapping or historical records to show details of the original house although archaeological records for the adjoining property at 30-42 Lower Fort Street show the existence of a pre-1822 stone building which, as with Darling House itself, was extended, modified and converted into two dwellings during the mid-19th century. = Construction of Darling House, c.1840 = John Rae's 1842 sketch \\"Millers Point from Flagstaff Hill\\", with Darling House to leftThe sandstone building now known as \\"Darling House\\" was built by Joseph Farris in the early 1840s, a period of great depression in Sydney. It was a large house of eight rooms (at a time when most houses in Millers Point contained two or four rooms), with its construction clearly being an attempt by the owner to build a fashionable stone dwelling designed to fit in with the other grand Lower Fort Street houses. The success of local mercantilist ventures and associated industries became evident in both commercial and residential architecture, constructed for merchants such as Robert Towns and Robert Campbell. Sections of Millers Point became regarded as affluent enclaves, with Argyle and Lower Fort Streets known as 'Quality Row.' Darling House was built to provide residential accommodation for the growing number of workers moving into the area that were associated with the expanding wharves along the Millers Point shoreline (such growth resulting from the exporting of wool to England and from the whaling industry). The site on which the house was built comprised two allotments, the northern allotment was granted to Joseph Farris and the southern allotment to Michael Gannon, a local builder. Soon after the allotments were granted Gannon admitted that, at the time the grant was made, the southern allotment was actually the property of Farris and in 1842 Gannon formally conveyed the allotment to Farris for the nominal sum of five shillings. Darling House .Upon construction, the interior of the house was divided by a large corridor. On the ground floor to the left of the corridor there was a dining/living room with two bedrooms on the right. On the upper floor there were four bedrooms on either side of the corridor. A stone kitchen and breakfast room were connected to the rear of the house, a bathroom to the right of the backdoor and timber laundry against the rock face. During the 1860s the ground and first floor Victorian verandas were added to the house, with the first floor windows being converted into French doors. These modifications are classic representative examples of the development of Australian architecture away from the traditional English styles in response to local environmental factors. English bald faced buildings offered little protection against the sun while the French doors and veranda allowed for greater air circulation through the house alleviated the effects of the heat during the summer months. Such architectural features are illustrative of the way in which Australian architectural styles were forced to differ from the traditional English styles to accommodate for the vastly different Australian climate.  Joseph Henry Farris (1807-1859) Joseph Henry Farris was born in England in 1807, to Joseph Farris and Hannah Longhurst. In 1827 Farris‚Äô father died leaving him an inheritance. He used this inheritance to book passage for himself and his wife, Elizabeth to Australia, arriving in Sydney in May 1830.Shipping Intelligence - Arrivals, Sydney Gazette and NSW Advertiser, Sat 15 May 1830 p2.Trove Archives As a free settler, Farris quickly established himself as a prolific local businessman plying his trade as a boat builder, publican and Sergeant in the water police. As a prominent individual in Sydney at the time, Farris‚Äô name was inscribed upon the visiting list at Government House. An avid boat builder and regatta competitor, in 1832 Farris built the first boat ever manufactured in Australia, which he subsequently raffled off for a total of ¬£30. Farris obtained prominence around Sydney as a publican, holding licences for the Whalers Arms Hotel located on the corner of Windmill Street and Lower Fort Street, the Young Princess Hotel (now the Hero of Waterloo) and the Shakespeare Hotel. It appears that Farris never resided at Darling House. It was built as a commercial venture which Farris owned together with three other commercial residences on Fort Street. The house was leased out to various middle-class, educated residents (including artists, musicians, teachers and police officers) for a period of around 60 years whilst the family owned the property and until it was resumed by the Sydney Harbour Trust in 1901.  Notable residents and occupants of Darling House (1842-1900) To Let advertisement for Darling House, The Sydney Morning Herald, 12 October 1842The first record for lease of the house is an advertisement dated 12 October 1842, which read:Advertisement from Mr Canham, resident of Darling House, offering violin and flute lessons, Sydney Morning Herald, 9 March 1844 Early occupants and residents of Darling House have been distilled from public advertisements in Sydney papers and also from Sydney City Council rates assessment records and the Sands Directory. Some notable resident at Darling house included Mr Canham, a musician in the colony. An advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald of 9 March 1844 advertised music lessons (violin and flute) from the then resident of Darling House, a Mr J. G. Canham. In addition to \\"giving instructions on the above instruments\\", Mr Canham advertised that \\"he will feel pleasure in attending Balls, Parties, &c;, having formed a very superior Band, capable of giving every satisfaction in the performance of the most admired and popular airs, waltzes, quadrilles, &c;, now played in London. Orders left at the residence of Mr C., Darling House, Lower Fort Street, will be immediately attended to\\".The Sydney Morning Herald, 9 March 1844 Mr John B Edmonds, celebrated bibliophile and bookseller also resided at Darling House around 1844. He imported and sold from this residence \\"one of the most splendid collections of Books of every description of English and foreign literature, together with Fine Arts... ever offered to the Australian public\\".Sydney Morning Herald, 17 June 1844 p.1 from Trove Archives, National Library of Australia Doctor Leopold Sachs resided in Darling House from 1861 to 1876. Doctor Sachs was a prominent Sydney surgeon and homeopathic doctor, renowned for giving free medical advice to the poor. Mrs Rosa Strange was the wife of prominent naturalist Frederick Strange, who accompanied Charles Sturt on his 1844 expedition to Central Australia and collected on expeditions with the well known zoologist John Gould . She resided in Darling House through the late 1870s and 1880s and as a school teacher ran a school in the local area. Scottish born painter, illustrator, engraver and lithographer, George Baird Shaw also lived in Darling House around 1857. It was during his residence at Darling House that Shaw published a highly finished engraving on steel of the Lord Bishop of Sydney, Bishop Frederic Barker.Sydney Morning Herald, 17 February 1857 p.5 from Trove Archives Rosaleen Norton, also known as the Witch of Kings Cross, lived in Darling House at the time that it was a boarding house in the early 1900s. She received prominence due to her satanic drawings that were often published in local tabloid newspapers. The house originally suffered from the constant discharge of water closets from the houses facing Prince's Street. The stench was so bad that the occupiers were compelled to close all the doors and windows at the back of the house to keep out the horrid smells. Upon the death of Joseph Farris, circa. 1859, his widow Elizabeth Farris resided in the house. During this time she rented out a number of the rooms and kept an aviary and goats on the property. = Outbreak of the plague (1900) = Catching rats, the plague 1900Map of Darling Harbour Resumptions, 1900The Bubonic Plague struck the Rocks area and Millers Point in December 1900, with the first reported case being Arthur Payne, a carter who worked in the Rocks. The New South Wales Government and Sydney Council took this opportunity to redevelop the area and began a quarantine and cleansing operation in The Rocks, Millers Point (including present day Dawes Point) and Darling Harbour. The Sydney Harbour Trust was formed in 1901 and given extensive powers to rebuild, reclaim land, build new infrastructure and manage the facilities along the port of Sydney. The Sydney Harbour Trust resumed almost all of the properties in The Rocks, Millers Point and Darling Harbour between 1900 and 1902 in order to clean up the area and implement quarantine measures. = Resumption by Sydney Harbour Trust (1901) and use of Darling House until 1990s = On 29 December 1900 the Sydney Harbour Trust issued notice in the Government Gazette of the resumption of Darling House, which occurred in 1901 under the Darling Harbour Wharves Resumption Act 1900, although the Sydney City Council Rates Assessments Books still noted the Farris family as Owner Landlord of the property right up until 1906. Darling House was fortunate to survive this period as many of the houses in the area were deemed unhygienic and demolished, with the backyards being covered in concrete or asphalt. Darling House c1901Upon resumption by the Sydney Harbour Trust, the land on which Darling House stood and the vacant land on the southern allotment were clearly distinguished as separate entities in the rates assessment books. There was a clear distinction between the use of Darling House, as a boarding house and residential accommodation, and the use of the southern allotment for commercial purposes. Upon resumption, the Sydney Harbour Trust almost immediately converted Darling House into a boarding house and accommodation was leased out by the State Government of New South Wales. In 1948-49 Darling House was converted into a warehouse, resulting in the demolition of most of the internal walls and outbuildings on the property to allow vehicle access to the back of the house. From that point on the house was leased to a variety of commercial companies. The last recorded commercial tenant of Darling House was Lep Transport who installed a petrol tank and bowser onto the property. After Lep Transport vacated the facility, the year of which is unknown, the property remained vacant and fell into a state of disrepair. The southern part of the site which formed a separate allotment remained vacant for much of the time since historic occupation of The Rocks and Millers Point although one historical map indicates a shed may have stood on the land. Oral records from local residents living in the area in the early twentieth century also recall the vacant site being used for a variety of purposes including an outdoor cinema and a plasterer's workshop. Around 1918, the rates assessment books indicate that the site was leased to Charles Rasmussen & Co, makers/repairers of casks and barrels, and as a cooperage, store and laundry. At this time a one storey brick building comprising two rooms, stood on the land. Use of the southern allotment of Darling House site as a cooperage by Chas.Rasmussen & Co c1918 = Caraher's Stairs = Caraher's Stairs .In 1857 Caraher's Stairs was constructed, flanking the northern wall of Darling House. The stairs were constructed to provide local residents access up to Princes Street (now the site of the Sydney Harbour Bridge) and was named after Owen Joseph Caraher, a local soap merchant. The stairs were a prominent thoroughfare, providing access between Millers Point and central Sydney. The stairway was heavily used and some of the behaviours and practises that occurred on the stairs prompted the local Citizens Vigilance Committee to write to the Town Clerk in a letter dated 10 July 1900: \\"It appears that these stairs are the resort of people who continually lounge about them and cover the steps with expectoration, tobacco juice etc. It is also stated that frequently there are rotten eggs thrown on the stairs in addition to the dust and dirt caused by continual traffic. Under these circumstances we are directed to ask that they be swept at least once a day and that they be hosed with water twice a week. In their present state they are almost impassable to ladies who wish to keep their dresses clean\\".Letter to the Town Clerk from the Citizens vigilance Committee, 10 July 1900, Complaints re dirty state of Playfair's, Caraher's and Merriman's Stairs caused by expectoration of tobacco and throwing of rotten eggs, City of Sydney Archives, 1900/2571 In 1933 the stairs were demolished as part of the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. There are still small remnants of this stairway in situ at the northern boundary of Darling House. A fragment of the original material, part of the original sandstone side wall and coping remain, and a darker colour to the brickwork on the building that was built while the stairway existed shows the outline of the stairway. = Conversion to The Rocks Cottage Nursing Home, 1994 = Darling House prior to restoration c1992In 1994 Darling House underwent extensive renovations under the design of heritage architect Howard Tanner, including the construction of a new dwelling on the southern allotment, in order to convert the house into an aged care facility. The conversion into an aged care facility was a community initiative of the Resident Action Group in Partnership with the Rocks Cottage Type Nursing Home Committee. It was a community funded and supported organisation from the time of its opening on 4 October 1994 until 2015.Plaque located on the property. In 2014 the State Government of New South Wales made the decision to sell 293 Government owned houses in Millers Point and Dawes Point to private purchasers, which it did through until 2018. In 2015 the State Government of New South Wales made the decision to raise the rent on Darling House from five dollars per month to a market rate, which led to the closure of the aged care facility and subsequent sale of the property. = Purchase and restoration by Dr Shane Moran, 2016 = Fire mark from the Fire Insurance Company Sydney Copper incorporating the golden fleece emblem, . Darling House, pictured in 2019 undergoing restoration. In February 2016 the vacant and increasingly dilapidated Darling House property was purchased for $7.7 million from the New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation at public auction by Dr Shane Moran. Dr Moran had also been involved in the ownership and restoration of another one of Sydney's heritage properties, Swifts, Darling Point. Following the purchase of the Darling House property, Dr Moran stated his intention to restore the original Georgian house and subsequent additions to an aged care residence or seniors' living facility, albeit a more upmarket one then previously, \\"ensuring that the original Georgian features are restored\\".\\"Historic property takes a step back but a leap upmarket\\", Sydney Morning Herald, Wednesday 2 March 2016, p7 The Chairman of the Millers Point Resident Action Group Mr John McInerney said, at the time of the sale, that although he wasn't opposed to the new aged care facility he was angered that the New South Wales government \\"has taken a community facility, cashed it in for $7 million odd dollars and has now made it inaccessible to the bulk of residents around here\\" The property has undergone a major heritage restoration and upgrade during the period from 2016 to 2019 in order to both maintain the integrity of the original historic building as well as to enhance its adaptive re-use as a boutique luxury seniors' living and retirement home. The extensive works over a period of more than three years involved the complete replacement of the slate roof, installation throughout of cedar joinery and staircases, original marble fireplaces, old leadlight windows and doors and the extensive upgrading of the building to BCA Class 3 standards and integration of all modern technology and systems. During the period of the restoration of Darling House, a rare and original fire insurance mark from the Sydney Fire Insurance Company was located and was displayed within the property. The Sydney Fire Insurance Company was established in 1844 at 468 George Street Sydney. Fire marks were issued for display at properties insured by the company against fire, there being no public fire brigades in the colony of New South Wales at that time. The Sydney Fire Insurance Company fire mark was in pressed copper displaying the company's name and an image of a golden fleece, being at that time in the colony a sign of safety and security following the growth of the wool industry. The symbol of the golden fleece has been adopted as the emblem for Darling House depicting this history and the association with security.  Description  Two storey Regency house of sandstone.

It was written in 1864 and published by Chapman & Hall in February 1865. In his 1883 autobiography, Trollope stated that Miss Mackenzie \\"was written with the desire that a novel may be produced without any love; but even in this attempt it breaks down before the conclusion.\\" Plot summary After spending most of her adult life nursing first her dying father and then her invalid brother Walter, Margaret Mackenzie inherits a significant fortune from Walter at his death. Very unused to mingling in society, but seeking her place in it, Miss Mackenzie moves to a town called Littlebath (modeled after Bath, Somerset), and joins a group of Evangelicals centered around the popular local pastor Mr. Stumfold and his wife. At Littlebath, she meets three men who are interested in marrying her. One is Samuel Rubb, the business partner of her surviving brother, Tom Mackenzie; another is Mr. Maguire, Mr. Stumfold's curate, who is only interested in securing her wealth; and the third is her cousin, John Ball, a widower with a large family to support. She is soon asked by Mr. Rubb to lend him and her brother ¬£2500 for business purposes, the amount supposedly (but not) secured against the business. Mr. Rubb eventually admits that the loan is not as he had described and is unlikely to ever be paid back. His honesty allows him to remain a prospective husband, though his manners are not those of the upper class, as Miss Mackenzie is painfully aware. She is invited for a short stay with the Ball family, and while there refuses a marriage proposal from John Ball. Mr. Maguire asks Miss Mackenzie to marry him when she returns to Littlebath, but she is put off by a prominent, disfiguring squint. She manages to avoid giving him a definite answer when she is informed that her brother Tom is dying and wishes to see her. While in London, she refuses Mr. Maguire by letter, as her fortune will be needed to help support Tom's family. After Tom's death, Miss Mackenzie finds out that there is a problem with her brother Walter's will, and that John Ball is the rightful inheritor. She puts up no resistance to restoring the estate to him. He asks her to marry him again while the legal issues are being dealt with by their respective lawyers, and she accepts him. Mr. Maguire, unwilling to believe Miss Mackenzie has lost all her wealth, starts writing articles in an Evangelical newspaper about a Lion and the Lamb he intends to devour. The story of \\"the Lion and the Lamb\\" is picked up by newspapers across the country, causing John Ball much agony, even though public opinion is on his side. The courts eventually decide in favour of John Ball, who soon becomes Sir John Ball after his father's death. Over the objections of his mother, Sir John and Miss Mackenzie are married. Mr. Maguire marries a lodger in Tom Mackenzie's old house, Miss Corza, while Mr. Rubb becomes the acknowledged suitor of one of Tom's daughters. Critical response In his 1883 autobiography, Trollope stated that Miss Mackenzie \\"was written with the desire that a novel may be produced without any love; but even in this attempt it breaks down before the conclusion.\\" Critics of the day did not praise the novel, but found that it had humor and interest. Early 20th century critics like Michael Sadleir were dismissive of it. Though critics like the young Henry James found Miss Mackenzie vulgar and prosaic, others have found interesting aspects to the novel, including the fidelity and sympathy with which Trollope depicts the lives of ordinary characters like Miss Mackenzie and Mr. Rubb, and his satirical treatment of Evangelical society, of its representatives in the novel, Mr. and Mrs. Stumfold, and of the group gathered around them. Near the end of the novel there is a London charity bazaar filled with fashionable society, which some critics have found amusingly ridiculous.

Opened in 1968 as part of the initial NLEx segment between Quezon City and Guiguinto, Bulacan, it was one of the first projects of the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines, now the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC). Construction of the interchange was precipitated by the large number of motor vehicles in Manila and the surrounding suburbs in the 1960s, which contributed to significant traffic congestion. On June 25, 1966, President Ferdinand Marcos ordered the Department of Public Works to undertake the construction of a number of road projects to be financed through World War II reparations, including the construction of interchanges on vital intersections along EDSA.Office of the President of the Philippines. (1966). \\"Official Week in Review: June 16 ‚Äî June 30, 1966\\". Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines, 62(31), cclxi-cclxxvii. This order would later lead to the construction of this interchange, replacing a previous roundabout between EDSA, Bonifacio Avenue and the Quirino Highway, and the Magallanes Interchange between EDSA and the South Luzon Expressway (SLEx), which opened in 1975. A shrine to Andres Bonifacio would later be constructed inside the interchange, which underwent a ‚Ç±13 million renovation in 2009. Flooding in the area around the Balintawak Interchange is a problem, with the interchange being named in 2014 as one of the twenty-two most flood-prone roadways in Metro Manila. In 2015, the Manila North Tollways Corporation, the concessionaire of the NLEx, spent close to ‚Ç±70 million to improve the interchange's drainage systems in order to mitigate flooding. In addition to flooding, the interchange has been criticized by columnist Cito Beltran of the Philippine Star for being rife with corrupt policemen and petty crime. Apart from the wet markets and drop- off points of goods from the north, Ayala Malls Cloverleaf and the entire Cloverleaf complex is located southeast of the interchange.

On July 30, 1998 the Beechcraft 1900D operating the flight collided in mid-air with a light aircraft over Quiberon Bay. This accident was known as Quiberon Bay plane crash. Both aircraft crashed in the sea, killing fifteen people. Accident Flight 706 took off from Lyon‚ÄìSaint-Exup√©ry at 12:21 local time on a flight to Lorient Lann-Bihou√© airport. About seventy minutes into the flight, the crew made a request to the Lorient approach controller to deviate from their route slightly to the west to Quiberon Bay. The reason for this detour was to give the passengers and crew a view of the SS Norway (previously named SS France), at that time the longest ocean liner ever built in France. Later examinations of the 1900D's cockpit voice recorder revealed that a passenger made his way to the cockpit and told the pilot and co-pilot of the presence of the Norway nearby, then suggested that the crew fly the aircraft closer to the ship. At the time of this request, a Cessna 177 registered F-GAJE belonging to a local flying club took off from the airfield at Vannes for a local flight to Quiberon. At 13:53, after first being cleared to descend to over the bay, the Proteus crew contacted air traffic control again and cancelled their flight plan to operate under instrument flight rules, switching to visual flight rules; they then put the 1900D into a descent from to while making a 360¬∞ turn around the ship. At 13:56 the pilot of the Cessna contacted the flight information service at Quiberon as he passed Larmor-Baden and informed them of his intent to descend from to . At 13:57 the Proteus crew announced to the Lorient approach controller that they had reached the end of their 360¬∞ turn and asked to take a direct course for Lorient. After they received confirmation of this request at 13:58, the Proteus crew's aircraft collided with the Cessna. Both aircraft immediately fell to the water, killing all 14 passengers and crew on board the Beechcraft, as well as the sole occupant of the 177. Investigation The investigation found that the Cessna's transponder had not been switched on. In documentation published by the Aeronautical Information Service in 1997 and 1998 and probably used by the pilot of the Cessna, the use of a transponder while operating under visual flight rules could be interpreted as optional. As a result of the transponder being off, the Cessna was not depicted on the radar screen of the Lorient approach controller and its traffic information could not be relayed to the crew of the Beechcraft. In communicating with an AFIS controller at Quiberon, the pilot of the Cessna was likewise not informed of the presence of the Beechcraft. The investigation also revealed that the organization of activity in the Beechcraft's cockpit as well as its ergonomics during the left-hand 360¬∞ turn did not allow for effective monitoring during the merger of the two aircraft, particularly to the outside of the turn, placing the Cessna in the Beechcraft's blind spot. The position of the sun as well as the configuration of the Cessna's fuselage and nose cowling were thought to have impeded the view of the Cessna's pilot in the moments just prior to the collision. Following this accident, the BEA recommended that pilots should only cancel instrument flight rules flight plans in cases of necessity. Dramatization This accident was featured in the 16th season of the Canadian TV series Mayday. It aired on 5 July 2016 and is titled Deadly Detour.

In 2011 FIGO recognized two systems designed to aid research, education, and clinical care of women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years. This page is a summary of the systems and their use in contemporary gynecology. FIGO System 1. The system for definition and nomenclature of normal and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years. Background FIGO System 2. The PALM-COEIN System for classification of causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years, unrelated to pregnancy, is rarely life-threatening, but is frequently life altering. The symptoms frequently interfere with quality of life and those girls and women afflicted with chronic AUB spend significant amounts of personal resources on menstrual products and medications. Such women are 30 per cent less productive at work, and, consequently, suffer a similar reduction in income. For low resource countries, the combination of poor nutrition, lack of access to simple therapy with iron replacement, and the symptom of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) are collectively responsible for the global epidemic of iron deficiency anemia, a circumstance that sets up a pregnant population vulnerable to peripartum hemorrhage and its sequellae, including death. The prevalence of AUB in the reproductive years is high; it is estimated that it affects 30% of all women at some time in their lives. Approximately 5% seek care each year; and up to 30% of all visits to gynecologists are for an AUB symptom. The problem of AUB burdens the economy, employers, as well as women and their families. The total annual direct and indirect costs of AUB are estimated to exceed 37 billion USD. There is evidence that, even in developed countries, only about half of those affected actually seeks care, and that many who do are not satisfied with the results. For many, hysterectomy remains a common therapy for those who have access to healthcare. With the massive worldwide impact of both acute and chronic AUB, the relevance of safe and effective clinical care cannot be overestimated. Although common sense interventions such as iron therapy are often underused in developed countries and frequently unavailable in developing nations, these and related therapies deal with reducing the consequences HMB the symptom, not the cause itself. Abnormal uterine bleeding in the reproductive years comprises a complex set of disorders that include abnormalities in endocrine, endometrial and hemostatic function and a number of structural anomalies that include polyps, adenomyosis and leiomyomas or fibroids. It is important to understand that many of the structural abnormalities may not contribute to the patient‚Äôs symptoms ‚Äì they may lie asymptomatic while the cause or causes of the AUB may be elsewhere. Determination of the causes of AUB in the reproductive years remains a major challenge for investigators, clinicians and educators. Investigators have to conceive and then execute relevant bench and clinical investigation; clinicians must deal with the patient in their office or hospital and educators of medical students and postgraduate trainees such as residents and fellows are encumbered with the task of providing a mechanism for understanding AUB that facilitates proper investigation and therapy. For a number of investigators and educators, it became apparent that there were at least two major impediments to dealing with these challenges. The first was a disjointed collection of poorly defined and inconsistently used terms and definitions that undermined effective communication among investigators, clinicians and trainees alike. The second was the absence of a system for classifying the potential causes, or contributors to AUB symptoms in a specific patient. These circumstances lead to difficulties with the interpretation of both basic science research and clinical trials as since specimens and patients could be \\"contaminated\\" with potential confounders. As a result, in order to obtain clearly informative basic science as well as translational and clinical investigation, a comprehensive approach to both investigation and categorization was needed. It was in this context that the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) Menstrual Disorders Working Group was created. Starting in 2005, a group of experts that comprised those from the FDA, related professional societies and gynecologic medical journals, and representatives from the basic, translational, and clinical sciences were assembled to tackle the issues in a systematic fashion. The FIGO Systems of Nomenclature of Terms and Classification of Causes of AUB in the Reproductive Years The development of these systems was in large part based upon a process was conducted using RAND's Delphi process. The results allowed for a collective recognition of the disparity and inconsistency in definitions and terminology a circumstance that was a surprise to many. The result of this process was a near unanimous decision to create a new set of descriptive and unambiguous terms that could be translated into a wide spectrum of languages. This process resulted in the first FIGO system; one that provided both definitions and nomenclature of normal and abnormal uterine bleeding using the 5th to 95% percentiles from the available large-scale epidemiological studies. Included in this set of definitions was the adoption of the term HMB - a symptom (not a diagnosis) - that was described by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence as ‚Äúexcessive menstrual blood loss, which interferes with a woman's physical, social, emotional and/or material quality of life‚Äù. These findings and recommendations were published simultaneously in 2007, in Fertility and Sterility and Human Reproduction. What is now FIGO‚Äôs system of nomenclature and definitions has undergone very modest modifications that will continue to be modified and revised as appropriate. The classification system, known by the acronym ‚ÄúPALM-COEIN‚Äù, was developed and first published a textbook, and then, after ratification by the Working Group, was accepted by FIGO in 2010 and finally published together with the nomenclature system and definitions in 2011. Each of the first eight letters stands for a discernable category of disorder, potentially found in an individual with an AUB symptom (Figure 2). The ‚ÄúPALM‚Äù categories comprise disorders that are definable by imaging and/or histopathological evaluation (polyps, adenomyosis, leiomyomas, malignancy and hyperplasia), while the ‚ÄúCOEI‚Äù classifications are not definable structurally (coagulopathies, ovulatory disorders, endometrial disorders, iatrogenic). Coagulopathies require confirmation by laboratory testing, while, at least for the present, ovulatory and endometrial disorders are primarily, and at least clinically, defined by a structured history. Irregular ovulation or anovulation can be supported by a number of laboratory and histopathological assessments, not typically applied in clinical settings. The ‚ÄúN‚Äù classification, originally ‚ÄúNot yet classified‚Äù now ‚ÄúNot otherwise classified‚Äù is reserved for entities that are rare or of undetermined relationship to AUB symptoms. It is recognized that each of the major categories may include subgroups that are known or suspected to have clinical relevance. The first of these ‚Äúsubclassification systems‚Äù was for leiomyomas (Figure 3), recognizing their prevalence and the already existing classification system for submucous leiomyomas first published by Wamsteker et al. and then adopted by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE). Added was a category for submucous myomas that make contact with the endometrium but do not distort the endometrial cavity (Type 3), and subclassification for intramural leiomyomas and the various types of subserous myomas. The 2011 publication, as well as other publications authored or coauthored by the FIGO Menstrual Disorders Working Group, also explicitly included the process of investigation ‚Äì that is, from the identification that a patient actually has one or more symptoms of AUB (FIGO System 1) to the classification of her condition as categorized by FIGO System 2, the PALM-COEIN System. The systems have been endorsed by a number of national organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG Practice Bulletin 128).

Biography Yasmeen was born and raised until the age of 14 in Jerusalem, Israel. As a child, she danced at Professor Hasia Levi-Agron's class, and ballet at Yaakov Lipshitz's in Jerusalem. Her first performance was an end-of- year dance at YMCA Jerusalem, when she was 6 years old. In 1984, at the age of 11, Yasmeen and her family moved to New York City. She graduated from the High School of the Performing Arts there, and received a scholarship at the Martha Graham School in New York City, where she would dance every Saturday when she was 14 to 17. Her first creation was heavily inspired off of Admon Zabes' letters. Upon finishing her studies, she returned to Israel, though returned to the United States for her academic studies, and received her BA in concert dance from the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University in 1997, where she presented her works for the first time, and at the same time studied in other institutions outside Tisch as well, among them Movement Center, where many concert dance teachers and artists with diverse opinions gather and discuss controversial concert dance issues. Yasmeen finished her academic studies in 1997, and since then has been presenting her works in various places. The first place where she danced and presented her works was at Gowanus Arts Exchange. Following, she was invited to present her works at Duncan Center in Prague, Czech Republic. During her final year at Tisch, she worked on her piece A Car and a Bandage. Then, she created two new pieces, the solo pieces Ina's Wall and Ring Ding Round Zero. Since 1999, she has been living in Tel Aviv. Her works have regularly been presented at the Suzanne Dellal Center in Tel Aviv, and extensively throughout the world, for example at Lincoln Center Festival in New York, Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin, the Place Theatre in London, Montpellier Dance Festival in France, and many more. To date, Yasmeen has created a total of 8 long works (over 1 hour long) and 6 short ones (up to 45 minutes long), including \\"Green Fields\\" for the Batsheva Ensemble and \\"UNDER2\\", a Matanicola Production in Berlin. The company had recently won the Ministry of Culture's Prize for Small Ensemble for the performance of Singular Sensation. In 2014, Godder created her first site- specific choreography for the Petach Tikva Museum of Art, Israel as part of the exhibition 'Set in Motion' (co-curated by Drorit Gur Arie, and Avi Feldman). Following the exhibition, the first artist book dedicated to the work of Godder was published under the title: 'Extremum - Reflections on the Works of Yasmeen Godder'. Yasmeen is the artistic director of her dance company, where she teaches concert dance since her return to Israel. She has taught concert dance in several art schools in Israel, among them the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bikurei HaItim in Tel Aviv. In 2007, she established the Yasmeen Godder Studio at the Mendel Culture Center in Jaffa, and to this day all of her activity is based there, as well as it being where the company's offices are situated, where the company mainly rehearses, and where she mainly teaches nowadays.

It was designed by Colin Deighton and built in 1911. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 September 2010.  History  St Michael and All Angels Anglican Church, located in Alford Street, is an elegant timber building designed by architect Colin Deighton and erected between December 1910 and 1911. Its intact timber interior exhibits superior craftsmanship. The land on which the church is sited was donated by Arthur Youngman of Taabinga who also contributed to the church's building fund. Settlement in the Kingaroy area commenced in the 1840s when Taabinga and Burrandowan pastoral stations were taken up, and was followed by agricultural land selection from the 1880s. Selectors grew maize and raised pigs, which were sold at Kilkivan (the nearest railhead on the Kilkivan branch railway) for many years. With the approach of the rail line from Kilkivan, transportation of produce to markets became more feasible and the struggling agricultural settlements of the South Burnett became viable. The town of Kingaroy owes its establishment to the arrival of the Kilkivan branch railway in 1904. In 1898 the only resident in the vicinity of Kingaroy was Daniel Carroll who had selected a 160-acre block abutting the 3430 acre Kingaroy Paddock selection in 1891 and built a hut and yard for his horses. By 1900 he had built a cottage and had selected further blocks of land adjoining his original portion. In 1902 a provisional school opened in Kingaroy with about twenty pupils. Once the Kilkivan branch railway reached the peg near the corner of the Kingaroy Paddock in 1904, the railway terminus was the impetus for the establishment of Kingaroy township. Both Carroll and Arthur Youngman, owner of the Kingaroy Paddock, sold town blocks at public auction during 1904. When the first train arrived, there were only three buildings - Carroll's new hotel, the Carrollee, FC Petersen's store and Carroll Cottage. After the railway arrived Kingaroy quickly developed as a service centre with the establishment of commercial premises such as shops and hotels. These were soon followed by public buildings, churches and schools. The seven years during which Kingaroy was the railhead were enough for it to establish a lasting dominance over neighbouring townships. During the first four decades of the 20th century the South Burnett was a rapidly developing agricultural area in the Wide Bay district. The railway facilitated the clearing of the land for agriculture and timber became the major industry for some years with teams hauling logs to the Kingaroy railway yards. From the Wide Bay region's maize production was the second highest in the state, following the Darling Downs. It was the fourth largest wheat producing area and the fourth largest cotton producer in Queenslsand. During the 1920s the embryonic peanut industry became headquartered at Kingaroy. In 1929 the Wide Bay district's milk production was the second highest in the state after the Moreton district. By 1938 dairying in the Burnett district was burgeoning, having the second largest number of dairy herds and of dairy cows in Queensland after Moreton district. By 1941 Kingaroy was the largest town in the South Burnett region. Initially, Anglican services and Sunday School in Kingaroy were conducted by Reverend Percy Solly Wigram of Nanango parish in a hut that stood on the site now occupied by Carroll's buildings in Haly Street. However, with the rapid growth of the Kingaroy congregation a church became essential. Circa 1910 the congregation was offered two pieces of land for this purpose; one by Dan Carroll and the other by Arthur Youngman of Taabinga, who also was willing to make a donation to the building fund. Youngman's offer was accepted and a Diocesan grant was obtained for the Church's construction. Architect Colin Deighton, who was assistant to John Hingeston Buckeridge, the Anglican Diocese of Brisbane Architect between 1887 and 1901, designed the church. Deighton designed a number of country churches and St Colomb's Anglican Church at Clayfield in Brisbane. The foundation stone of St Michael and All Angels Church was laid on 10 November 1910 by the Venerable Arthur Rivers, Archdeacon of Toowoomba. Construction of the building, which was to seat 250 worshippers, began in December 1910 and was completed in 1911. Its cost, including furniture, was almost ¬£2000. The church was dedicated by Archbishop of Brisbane St Clair Donaldson in 1912 at a service attended by members of the whole community which regarded its opening as a great event for the growing township. In 1912 the Brisbane Diocese newsletter, The Church Chronicle, stated that St Michael and All Angels Church was \\"a really beautiful Church - one of the best wooden buildings in the Diocese\\". The church was built in a cruciform plan with few internal wall planes, an arched ceiling space formed by an exposed scissor-braced roof frame and a tall nave and arched windows giving the illusion of verticality. The timber interior of St Michael and all Angels Church is believed to have been milled at Taabinga. The red beanwood pulpit and pews were made from timber from the Atherton Tableland. The vicar, the Rev PS Wigram, who was a member of a wealthy English family, received gifts for the church. These included a carved English oak altar with inset panels of the angels painted by members of his family; an altar cross and candlesticks from Venice; and the chalice and paten, which were gifts from his godparents. A picture of St Peter, painted by a German artist, was presented by another English friend of the rector. Some time after 1912 the Nanango parish was divided into three - Nanango, Kingaroy and Wondai - each served by its own priest. A house for the rector (pre-1935) and later a hall were constructed on the site to fulfil the needs of the growing congregation. A wheelchair access ramp has been added to the northern side of the entry porch. On 14 November 1993 the church was consecrated by Assistant Bishop of Brisbane Clyde Wood. The development of a peanut storage and processing plant by the Peanut Board and Peanut Growers' Cooperative Association on adjacent land began in 1927. The success of the Kingaroy-based peanut industry has resulted in a large industrial site becoming the backdrop to the church. This juxtaposition highlights the aesthetically pleasing nature of St Michael and All Angels Anglican Church. The church has served the Anglican community in the Parish of Kingaroy since its establishment in 1910.  Description  Church with the Kingaroy Peanut Silos in the background, 2005 St Michael and All Angels Church, Kingaroy is a very intact example of an early twentieth century timber-framed church and is positioned on a largely flat site to the east of Kingaroy's main retail street. Its grounds are triangular in shape and are bound to the east by the former Kingaroy-Nanango railway easement and by Alford Street to the south. The church is oriented along an east-west axis with the entry porch to the west. The towering silos of the Peanut Company of Australia stand to the north of the church grounds and form a dominant backdrop to the place. The church building is laid out in a typical cruciform plan with a central nave formed by a long, steeply gabled roof. This main roof is dissected by another gabled roof slightly lower in height which forms the north and south transepts. The northern transept contains a side-chapel and southern transept contains a vestry. Aisles are formed to the north and south of the nave by lower lean-to roofs running along its length. A gabled entry porch with hipped returns provides a protective covered entrance to the church from the west. The roofs to the church are clad with recent terracotta roof tiles and external walls are clad with weatherboards. It is supported on a mixture of timber and concrete stumps approximately one metre from the ground. Gutters are formed in metal with a quad-profile and drain to recent square profile downpipes. The main elevation (facing west) of the church is symmetrical in form with the entry porch projecting out from the main gabled structure. A timber-framed bellcote crowns the ridge of the main roof above the entry porch and is clad to match the main roof. Bracing fixed between the roofs' bargeboards form decorative ends to each of the projecting gable roofs. The entry porch is accessed via steps from the south and by a recent timber-framed ramp from the north. Decorative post brackets form arched openings on the porch which is enclosed to handrail height with weatherboards. Windows with frames decorated at the top to make an arch and filled with leadlighting illuminate the length of the nave. Stained glass windows are positioned in the side chapel and chancel walls. The shapes of the arches formed by carved frames in windows throughout vary depending on the width of the opening. Clerestory coloured leadlight windows are located on the northern and southern walls above the chancel. Crosses are fixed to the top of the bellcote and to each apex of the gabled roofs. Timber-framed steps lead from the southern side of the building to the vestry and on the northern side to the side-chapel. A pair of simple, ledged, double doors provide access into the church from the double entry porch via the ramp and stairs. The interior timberwork is unpainted. The building's exposed timber framing dominates the interior of the building. Scissor-braces fixed to pairs of rafters supporting the roof cross the width of the nave and the north and south transepts. Metal tie-rods are located at regular intervals in the ceiling space which is lined with unpainted v-jointed boards. The aisles are divided from the nave by a colonnade of timber arches supporting the main roof formed from timber posts and decorative timber brackets. The chancel is separated from the nave and crossing by a timber framed chancel arch with a variation of a rood screen formed in timber supporting a wooden crucifix. All timberwork is unpainted. The chancel is slightly raised and contains the altar which is formed from carved English oak. Early inset panels of paintings of angels have been relocated behind the altar to the eastern wall where dark timber panelled wall linings with lightly coloured cover strips are located. Intricately detailed candlesticks and an altar cross rest on the altar and timber communion or altar rails are located in front of it. A baptistery is located to the west of the side chapel with an intricately carved marble font. An early pulpit (located to the north of the chancel) and early pews positioned in the nave and the crossing are made from red beanwood. Organ pipes are located near the southern transept facing towards the nave. A timber hymnal board is fixed to the wall at the western end of the nave near the entry. The floor is carpeted. Garden beds planted with roses lie to the west of the church where a large, timber cross has been positioned. A spray of trees follows the boundary of the site creating a barrier to the railway siding. A simple timber framed entry arch is located on the Alford Street boundary where a recent concrete path leading from the street to the entry porch and vestry has been constructed.  Heritage listing  St Michael and All Angels Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 September 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Michael and All Angels Anglican Church illustrates the growth and prosperity of the township, which resulted from the extension of the railway line to Kingaroy in 1904. Kingaroy's role as the terminus of the rail line for the subsequent seven years consolidated its position as the major town of the South Burnett region, which evolved into one of Queensland's major agricultural districts during the first decades of the 20th century. The construction of St Michael and All Angels Anglican Church between 1910 and 1911, to serve the spiritual needs of Kingaroy's rapidly expanding population, is associated with this period of significant growth in the district. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. St Michael and All Angels Anglican Church is an excellent example of a timber-framed church, which at the time of construction was considered one of the best timber buildings in the Brisbane Diocese. Highly intact, it demonstrates the principal characteristics of an early 20th century Anglican church utilising a Latin cross plan with the northern transept accommodating a chapel, the southern transept a vestry and the western end an entry porch. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. St Michael and All Angels Church has considerable aesthetic value being a well composed building in a cruciform plan. The Church is significant for its high degree of creative achievement in its interior craftsmanship. The highly intact, unpainted timberwork of the roof framing, walls and ceiling linings displays great artistic value. The church contains many finely crafted elements including an exposed roof frame which dominates the interior, ornate timber colonnades, rood screen, chancel arch, carved English oak altar, pulpit, bishop's chair, pews, panels of the angels and crucifix. Elaborately decorated candlesticks, chalice and paten and a painting of St Peter are also housed in the church. Its steeply pitched roof crested with an ornate bellcote makes a strong impact in the streetscape.

Outside of Tokyo, another location is found in Nipponbashi, Osaka. In total, there are 10 locations. While the store carries game culture-related paraphernalia, the flagship three-floor store is dedicated to rare Japanese games from older consoles.

The riddle is usually solved as 'reed pen', although such pens were not in use in Anglo-Saxon times, rather being Roman technology; but it can also be understood as 'reed pipe'.Patrick J. Murphy, Unriddling the Exeter Riddles (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2011), pp. 140-41; Dieter Bitterli, Say What I am Called: The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book and the Anglo-Latin Riddle Tradition (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009), pp. 8, 137. Text As edited by Krapp and Dobbie in the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records series, Riddle 60 runs: George Philip Krapp and Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie (eds), The Exeter Book, The Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records, 3 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1936), p. 225, accessed from http://ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/3009 . I was along the sand, near the seawall, beside the sea-surge; [I] dwelled firmly rooted in my original place. Few were any of the race of men that beheld my dwelling place in wilderness, for every dawn the dark sea surrounded me with its enveloping waves. Little did I expect that I, sooner or later, ever would speak mouthless over mead-benches, exchange words. It is somewhat a wonder, complex in the mind, for him who cannot understand such, how the point of the knife and the right hand, man‚Äôs intention and the blade, worked me with purpose, so that I would boldly disclose a verbal message for us two alone, so that other men will not know the meaning of our conversation far and wide.Helen Price, 'Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Leeds, 2014), p. 92; http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6607/; https://www.academia.edu/6827866. There has been some debate as to whether Riddle 60 is a text in its own right: it is followed by the poem The Husband's Message and has been read as the opening to that.E.g. Ralph W. V. Elliott, 'The Runes in \\"The Husband's Message\\" ', The Journal of English and Germanic Philology, 54 (1955), 1-8; Most scholars agree, however, that the two texts are separate.E.g. Roy F. Leslie, 'The Integrity of Riddle 60', The Journal of English and Germanic Philology, 67 (1968), 451-57; Sources The text is usually thought to have been inspired by the second riddle in Symphosius's collection, whose answer is 'harundo' ('reed').E.g. F. H. Whitman, 'Riddle 60 and Its Source', Philological Quarterly, 50 (1971), 108-15. The same riddle also occurs in the Latin romance of Apollonius of Tyre:Dieter Bitterli, Say What I am Called: The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book and the Anglo-Latin Riddle Tradition (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009), p. 137. Interpretation Riddle 60 is generally read alongside other Anglo-Saxon riddles about writing implements, as giving an insight into Anglo-Saxon attitudes to the craft of writing generally.E.g. Dieter Bitterli, Say What I am Called: The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book and the Anglo-Latin Riddle Tradition (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009), pp. 135-50; Patrick J. Murphy, Unriddling the Exeter Riddles (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2011), pp. 109-52. However, it also provides interesting links to the language and style of the so-called Old English elegies,E.g. Roy F. Leslie, 'The Integrity of Riddle 60', The Journal of English and Germanic Philology, 67 (1968), 451-57; and has recently been read as a case-study in ecocritical readings of Old English poetry, as it explores complex interactions of different assemblages of species and processes of crafting.Helen Price, 'Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Leeds, 2014), p. 92; http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6607/; https://www.academia.edu/6827866 Recordings * Michael D.

Thought  He developed the existential themes of mysticism, both in the Western philosophical and religious tradition and in the Vaishnava Bhakti one; in the essay ‚ÄúLo yoga devozionale indiano‚Äù (The Indian devotional yoga) he explains the social importance of the spirituality as existential journey rather than as institutionalized dogma. From a sociological point of view his analysis focused on the origins of the ancient Vedic culture; in his essay about Varna he shows how the ills of modern society derive from the break with the great traditional civilizations; therefore the historical and epistemological paradigms have to be rethought in the light of the ancient wisdom.Valentino Bellucci, Le strutture sociali del varnƒÅshrama-dharma. Saggio sull'origine delle caste indiane e sui paradigmi delle societ√† tradizionali, Solfanelli, 2014.Valentino Bellucci, Che cos'√® il Karma, Harmakis, 2016 Furthermore, he investigated on the origins of Christianity, inspired by the work of Mario Canciani, identifying lost lifestyles and teachings.Valentino Bellucci, Cristo era vegetariano?, Editoriale Programma, 2013.Nell'Arca di No√® di Mons. Mario Canciani - Introduzione, cattolicivegetariani.it. Bellucci proposes a critical recovery of ancient civilizations whose knowledges have a considerable social and individual value. His historical and sociological analyzes lead him to consider modernity as a mystification, a kind of collective self-deception that the society cultivates since the atheist and materialist Enlightenment; this mystification derives from an a priori rejection of the sacred, the divine, in order to follow the idols of technic and advanced capitalism. In this sense his investigation continues following in the footsteps of scholars as Jean Servier and Marcel de Corte.Valentino Bellucci, Il Sutra del naufrago.

It was built in 1891 by J Gibbs. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992.  History  Wylarah was selected in 1890 by Alfred Greenup who was manager of \\"Maryland\\" near Stanthorpe from 1868. He named the property after the Aboriginal word for black cockatoo. It comprised a grazing lease of 9,000 acres (3,600 ha) and an agricultural farm of 1,267 acres (506 ha) which were part of the resumption of Burrandowan Station. In 1891 work on the main homestead commenced by J Gibbs, a Victorian, with assistance from Greenup. A slab hut was erected for use while the homestead was built. The hut's hearth survives. The bricks were made from clay on the property while the timber was milled at Chinchilla. Some of the furniture was also built by Gibbs at this time. Originally planned to be U-shaped, the internal courtyard was considered too small, and so was covered and floored to form a central hall. An innovative feature was the integration of the kitchen into the house. Although they visited the property in 1891, it was 1897 before the Greenup family moved to Wylarah. Alfred Greenup continued as manager of \\"Maryland\\" until 1905. Wylarah's hall was the venue for the district's church services and other community activities for many years. After Greenup's death in 1915 the property was run by his son Harold. The lease area was halved in 1924. Following Harold Greenup's death in 1957 Wylarah was left to his daughter Frances, whose son now runs the property. He has undertaken considerable repairs including replacing the side verandah's floor and lining the service rooms at the rear.  Description  Wylarah, 1992 Wylarah is a pastoral property located approximately west of Kingaroy. The homestead is a single- storeyed, single-skinned timber building with a corrugated galvanised iron roof. The plan is unusual. It has a verandah on three sides, and a U-shaped hipped roof, encircling a double pitch over the central hall. The central hall is encircled by bedrooms to the east and west, a large lounge to the north, a dining room to the north east, kitchen to the south east and several smaller service rooms to the south, the latter including the southern entry vestibule. The more formal entrance to the house is located on the northern frontage, which also features a metal belfry and weathercock flanked by two red brick chimneys. An unpainted panel system is used throughout the interior as well as the exterior; it consists of an ironbark frame which is expressed, internally and externally, with vertically-jointed (probably cypress) infill panels trimmed with cavetto-section pine mouldings. The central hall, which measures approximately , has a polished beech floor, and a double-pitched, timber-lined ceiling with exposed rafters. A valley beam running north-south has two intermediate chamfer post supports, and two timber ties run east-west. The southern gable ends are glazed with yellow patterned glass. Similarly patterned glass is used in the fanlights above doors opening onto the central hall. The doors have clear glazed panels. The rooms surrounding the central hall to the north, west and east have timber-lined ceilings, and french doors with arched upper panels opening onto the verandah and fanlights. Brick fireplaces with timber mantelpieces serve six of these rooms. The verandah has chamfered timber posts with cross-braced timber balustrades, and a timber- lined ceiling with exposed rafters. Wylarah Bathhouse and windmill, 1992 The grounds include lawns and gardens to the east and north, and remnants of the original orchard to the west. To the south of the homestead are several original service buildings: to the immediate south east is a corrugated iron bath house, with a corrugated iron water tank on its roof and a steel windmill immediately adjacent; a timber and corrugated iron blacksmith's shed sits further out to the south, and contains early blacksmithing and carpentry tools; to the west is a double-storeyed corrugated iron coach house, with the coachman's residence above and two coach bays; a timber hoist approximately high sits between the coach house and the timber and corrugated iron stables. Most of the original buildings survive, and Wylarah stills functions as a pastoral property.  Heritage listing  Wylarah was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Wylarah is significant in demonstrating rare aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage, namely: it is an uncommonly intact example of a late 19th century homestead complex which served a medium-sized pastoral property; and the homestead is unusual and idiosyncratic in its construction, plan form, distinctive central hall, unpainted interior and exterior, and varied use of timber. Wylarah demonstrates the principal characteristics of a 19th century homestead complex on a pastoral property and its layout, unpainted materials, setting and harmonious colours of buildings and landscape exhibit aesthetic characteristics which are valued by the community. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.

He is remembered for his research on cancer and his austerity and small government policies. Biography Born in San Miniato, in Tuscany, Pietro Bucalossi was graduate in medicine and surgery to the University of Pisa. He became a prominent oncologist and associate to the National Institute of Cancers (Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, INT) and moved to Milan in 1934. For all his live, he was member of the \\"Italian League for the Fight against Cancer\\" and also was Director of the INT from 1956 to 1974. He also wrote medical books with his prot√©g√© Umberto Veronesi. In 1940, he served as medical captain in the Italian Royal Army. After the 25 July (Mussolini's deposition), he left the army and entered in the Italian resistance and National Liberation Committee, as member of the Action Party. He was also distrust to the communists after the death of Benito Mussolini, for their role in the death's concealing. In 1947, the Action Party disbanded and Bucalossi joined in to the Socialist Party of Italian Workers, that became the Italian Democratic Socialist Party in 1951. Representative for Milan to the Chamber of Deputies from 1958, in 1964 he resigned to become Mayor of Milan. Known for his strong personality and short temper, Bucalossi was a sincere supporter of the small government (despite his party's positions), similar to an American fiscal conservative. He realised a bilance budget and austerity policies, cut the city spending and opposed to the growing regionalism and eventually useless Regional Councils, that he called \\"parlamentini\\" (\\"small parliaments\\"). However, he supported the early green politics (more public parks), the expansion of the Linate Airport and inaugurated the first Milan Metro line. In 1967, he resigned as Mayor of Milan for lack support by his majority, like he opposed to the Unified PSI-PSDI. In 1968 Bucalossi was re-elected in the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Republican Party, and in 1974 he became Minister of Public Works in the Aldo Moro's Cabinet. As Minister, he fight against the uncontrolled constructions creating a law on construction permit in 1977. In the same year, he left the Republicans for his opposition to the abortion (that he's party supported) and joined in to the Italian Liberal Party. After his term end as representative, he left the politics and returned to his job as oncologist. He died in 1992.

Semliya is among the five most ancient pilgrimage sites for Jains of Malwa. It contains the temple of the 16th Jain tirthankar, Shri Shantinath.  Shri Semliyaji  Idol of Adhishtayak Dev now worshipped as Bheruji Shri Semliyaji is the temple of 16th Jain Tirthankar Shantinath. It is one of five most ancient pilgrimages of Malwa: Semliyaji, Bhopawar, Maksi, Mandav, and Vai Parshwanath. The 41 inch idol of Shantinath was discovered and the temple erected 2300 years ago during the rule of King Samprati. The King ordered his workers to build a tunnel from Ujjain to the temple's Sanctuary for the convenience of those traveling to the temple. The tunnel is no longer in use. The temple was first renovated 1700 years ago by shroff Bhima Mahajan. Evidence of these early renovations include markings of a clenched human fist on a marble pillar. No detailed markings of temple renovation have yet been identified for other Malwa pilgrimage sites. Before its first renovation, the temple reflected tapagacchiya yati tradition. According to legend, before Vir Sawant (933, 1700 AD) the four foundation pillars traveled through immense skies during the tantrik war and landed on earth via Yatiji. The war marks are the fist, sword, arrow and bardiche. The four pillars are still standing. Occasionally, percolation of water-milk on pillar surfaces has been observed, and since 2000 the percolation has been observed on some parts of the sanctuary as well. In 2011 the percolation of saffron water was recorded. Every year during the festival of the Lord's birth, thousands of devotees come to the temple and extract some part of the percolation onto money bills, clothing, etc. in a belief that it will bring them great fortune. The temple was famous in ancient times as well due to its presence on Delhi (known at that time as \\"Indrarastha\\"), Mandav route. According to texts, Acharya Jinkushalsuri (founder of the clan Khattargachh) marched a sangha from Jaisalmer to Mandav 9,000 years ago. He rested at Mandav and ordered that an idol be chiseled from a mineral rock. The idol is still in existence. Five hundred forty five years ago, Acharya Lakshmisagarsuri visited Semliya with his sangha and erected three other idols, one of which is a tirthankar Adinath under a kalpvraksha tree sitting on a peacock surrounded by a serpent. When recently gacchadhipati Acharya Gunsagarsuri visited the temple, he stated that he had seen an identical idol at Siddhanchal and offered the services of the sangha Mumbai-Sammetshikhar-Girnar-Palitana to locate the twin idol. In order to locate and secure the site of Temple, the ruler Acharya envisioned in meditation an idol of a god wearing a crown and smirking while riding a lion with a drum in his right hand, an ewer in his left hand, a knife in his waistband with many ancient symbols embossed on it, a beast under its right leg and a small animal near its left foot. It is said that the famous Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and his army expedition destroyed every Jain and Hindu temple between Delhi and Mandav, and although the emperor passed through a royal route while on expedition, the power of the god prevented him from noticing it before he destroyed it. The ruins of Mandav temples are proof of the expedition's destruction. Noteworthy is the Agarji Shantinath temple in Ratlam, which was protected at the time of the expedition by those who erected towers overnight. Over time due to the frequent coating of saffron, the idol's features became distorted such that pilgrims mistook it for a god Manibhadra idol. But the coating cracked in 1990 and the original features of the idol can now be clearly viewed. As there is no description of such a God in Jain manuscripts, people now worship them as god Bherujis. The idol feline cats are still intact after recent renovation, funded by 50 lakhs Sadhus (the shravaks), who had provided large donations maintained in perpetuity. The renovation of this temple was finished in 2000 on the day of Chairs Sudi. The idols of Gautama Swami, Shasan Devi and Nirvani Devi were installed, as well as a guru Mandir with idols of Acharya Jwersagarsuriji, Anandsagarsuriji, and Dharmsagarsuriji. Thirteen flags were hoisted on this occasion and since then many Sadhus and Sadhvis have spent Choumasa at the temple. The arrangement of this Tirtha is governed by the \\"Shri Shantinath Shwetambar Jain Mandir Trust\\". This Tirtha has two asylums for Sadhu Sadhvis, eight halls including one office and three dining halls, a kitchen and twelve additional rooms. Over the past several years, pilgrims regularly visit the temple sight. Semliya is 17 kilometers east from Ratlam Namli Road, which connects to this road via another road approximately five minutes travel distance away. Semliya is 15 kilometers from Bhopawar, 130 kilometers from Mandav, 24 kilometers from Vibrod and 85 kilometers from Nageshwar.

With in-house teams for all the above mentioned services, currently they serve across 6 cities in India where they have offices as well, which includes Bengaluru(Head office), Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune. They are also planning to expand the above mentioned services and the offices across 24 more cities in India. Their fumigation & sanitization service is currently present across 30 cities in India.  History  From its early days, Housejoy was facing competition from Indian brands namely UrbanCompany(formerly UrbanClap) & QuikrEasy(formerly QuikrServices), these brands made profit by collecting a small percentage of commission from the amount paid to the service providers for the service they provide to customers through these brands. Housejoy pursued a strategy of rapid growth through acquisition of the brands that focused on the segments within its market niche, and also by expanding to new cities in India. By 2016, Housejoy had expanded to 12 cities in India. In 2015, an article in Tech in Asia said that although the brand had been growing at a fast pace, it had difficulty in ensuring quality of services because of the highly unorganized services sector in India, wherein training of service providers had not been standardized. The brand also faced some problems in its onboarding process of not vetting service providers, which it was sending to customer's homes.  Restructuring  In May 2016, Housejoy's board of directors halted the brand's growth due to year-on-year loss, pushing out founders Kumar and Goel, cutting staff, reducing the number of cities served in India to 6, and said it will start focusing on its at-home beauty and salon services, which was its most profitable segment. Around the same time, Housejoy hired Saran Chatterjee, former vice president of Flipkart, as their new CEO. In 2017, Housejoy launched packers and movers under their home services offering, across Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad and Mumbai. In 2018, Housejoy launched Home Construction, Renovation, Interior Design and Painting businesses across Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad which could help them to scale up revenue by $15 billion per year. In February 2020, CEO Saran Chatterjee moved to a non-operating role and Sanchit Gaurav, formerly COO Housejoy, was appointed as the new CEO of Housejoy after which Housejoy launched on-demand home delivery service called \\"Housejoymart\\" for the home delivery of essential items to customers doorstep in Bengaluru. During COVID-19, Housejoy saw huge demand for sanitisation & fumigation service by homes and offices and started serving as many as 30 cities in India for the same. Housejoy partnered with 5 major firms during COVID-19 including government of Karnataka, Portea, SRL Diagnostics to set up COVID Testing Camps across Bengaluru. Housejoy also made many new appointments in their leadership team in 2020 as they are planning to expand. Currently, Housejoy has more than 100 projects in execution for their home construction and renovation businesses across Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.  Funding & Capitalisation  Housejoy received $4 million in Series A funding from Matrix Partners in June 2015. It then received another $23 million in Series B funding from Amazon, along with Matrix Partners, Qualcomm Ventures, ruNet, being the other participants in 2015. Housejoy also received another $3.2 million in Series B funding from Matrix Partners in 2018. Housejoy is now planning to raise Series C funding of $35 million for expansion of its home construction and interior design businesses by the end of the year 2020 as they have just bagged 100 crore revenue from their home construction, renovation, interior and painting businesses and have almost become profitable.

The Bazzanti Marble Studio won the medal for the category \\"sculpture\\".  The Art Gallery in Florence  The gallery was specialized in marble, alabaster and mosaics to satisfy customers consisting mainly of foreigners wishing to obtain perfect replicas of masterpieces admired during their trip. The gallery on the Lungarno Corsini was a very popular place, and its works were carefully followed by those who were interested in art. In 1822 Pietro Bazzanti took over the studio opened in 1815 by Luigi Bozzolini, the last descendant of a family of sculptors-decorators who had worked for the princes Corsini since '600, expanding the premises. The first evidence is provided by the major nineteenth-century city guides, which confirm that from the beginning the activity was allocated in the current Palazzo Corsini headquarters with large showrooms in front of the river and the sculpture studio was on the rear with access from via del Parione.  Pietro Bazzanti and Son  Andrea Orcagna statue, Uffizi Lodge, Florence, carved by Niccol√≤ Bazzanti Pietro Bazzanti born in 1775, lived in Via della Carraia, the current stretch of Borgo San Frediano from Via dei Serragli to Piazza San Frediano. He later moved into an apartment above the shop in Via del Parione at number 13. It was formed in the sculpture studio of Bozzolini who took over, continuing the production of high quality artistic replicas of ancient statues: the Florentine population census of 1841 declares \\"...makes sculpture statues\\". His son Niccol√≤ Bazzanti, was a talented sculptor, born in 1802 and died in 1869. In 1822 he won an award for two sketches at the Academy of Fine Arts, where he graduated in 1824 starting its autonomous activities also continuing to work with his father Pietro. In 1840 he was nominated by the Academy \\"Academician Professor of Sculpture in the First Class of the Arts and Design\\". In 1834 he sculpts the plastic decoration of the palace that the publisher Vincenzo Batelli had built in 1831-1832 in via Sant'Egidio at number 12. The project involved the decoration of the facade with statues of the four seasons made from Bazzanti, all gone during the last war. Niccol√≤ was also commissioned in 1834 to sculpt, along with other artists, the series of 28 statues of the \\"Illustrious Tuscany Men\\" for the Uffizi Lodge. The public subscription made to finance the transaction was not successful, so Niccol√≤ Bazzanti made only the Orcagna statue. The famous beautiful marble replicas of the Venus of the Medici and of Apollino furnishing the palace Revoltella in Trieste , were also made by Niccol√≤ Bazzanti. In the '70s of '800 Niccol√≤ gave the gallery his employee Thompson. In the mid-30s of the '900 Thompson gave in turn the gallery to his employee Biagioli. In 1960 it was bought by the Marinelli family, who renewed sculpture Studio introducing, alongside the marbles, the famous bronzes produced by its own Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry. For the historical workshop meant a new course marked by a management able to control more strictly the artistic quality of the works and to organize assistance more widespread in the export. In addition, the nineteenth-century models inherited from the old owners were added to those of the great collection of plaster moulds of the Foundry.

The General Gordon story Charles George Gordon was a first cousin of Hake's father, his paternal grandmother Augusta Maria Hake (n√©e Gordon) being Gordon's aunt. In 1884 Hake published The Story of Chinese Gordon. It concentrated on Gordon's role opposing the Taiping Rebellion. It became topical with the Siege of Khartoum launched that year by Mahdist forces. A companion volume Gordon in China and Soudan was published in 1885, and sold well. While Gordon remained in the besieged city of Khartoum, journals were taken out through the lines; J. Donald Hamill-Stewart, who left in September 1884, had been keeping a journal, a task taken over by Gordon himself from 10 September. What he wrote to 14 December was brought out, and sent to London.Nicoll, pp. 25‚Äì6 Sir Henry William Gordon, Gordon's brother, was entitled to the papers, after Gordon's death on 26 January 1885; and decided that Hake should edit them. On the other hand, the War Office wanted them suppressed. Gordon himself had thought some very personal comments should not be published; while the content included extended attacks on the current Liberal administration of W. E. Gladstone. Sir Henry was apparently unaware of Hake's political sympathies (he was a strong Conservative supporter).Nicoll, p. 26 and pp. 32‚Äì3 In the end a popular, two-volume edition of Gordon's journal appeared, with Hake as editor, on 25 June 1885. He added an introduction strongly critical of the government's inactivity in supporting Gordon.Nicoll, pp. 32‚Äì3 Sir Henry Gordon required, contractually, that substantial redaction of the text removed a large number of personal references. Heavy criticism of Evelyn Baring remained.Nicoll, pp. 32‚Äì4 Hake took advice from Wilfrid Meynell, and consulted Wilfred Scawen Blunt the Arabist on background.Nicoll, p. 36 and p. 41 Hake then lectured on Gordon and the failure of the Liberal government to rescue him in Khartoum, before the 1885 United Kingdom general election. He undertook a tour in England and Scotland, from the late summer to November: the election campaign started on 24 November.Nicoll, p. 42 The Conservatives supported the tour covertly through Richard Middleton; and finance was provided by Lord Cranborne and his sister, with whom Hake was in contact in October and December.Nicoll, p. 36 and p. 44 note 94 Later life Hake edited in 1866 The State, a Conservative weekly; it had a short lifespan.Nicoll, p. 43 note 77 He became interested in the economics of free trade, was a critic of the Bank Charter Act 1844, and invented a system of banking; which Oscar Wilde found amusing. He wrote works for the Free Trade in Capital League. Hake died on 8 December 1916 of peripheral neuritis, in the City of London Lunatic Asylum, Stone, Kent. Works Hake wrote: *Paris Originals: With Twenty Etchings (1878) *The Unemployed Problem solved (1884), pamphlet *The New Dance of Death (1884) with J. G. Lefebre *The Story of Chinese Gordon (1884).

It has also been called a \\"hatchet job\\". On the other hand, Camporesi in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes it as \\"a fundamental and seminal work, proposing not only a cultural and anthropological interpretation of the sociological problems, but even a philosophy of history and a theodicy.\\" *The Coming Individualism (1895) with O.

It was built from 1848 to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Burrandowan was established by Henry Stuart Russell in 1843 and was one of the first pastoral runs to be taken up in the Wide Bay area. The homestead buildings are early vernacular structures associated with the operation of this station. Russell arrived in Australia from England in 1840 and joined relatives in Sydney. These were the Hodgsons who had a property in the Hunter Valley and subsequently established Eton Vale station on the Darling Downs. Russell travelled with them to the Darling Downs and in 1841 took up Cecil Plains station with his brother Sydenham. Searches for pastoral land extended north in the early 1840s after the Moreton Bay region was opened for selection following the closure of the penal colony. Initial leases were taken up in the Moreton Bay, Darling Downs and Brisbane Valley regions, but by 1842 squatters were looking further north for suitable land. In May 1842, Russell joined an expedition to search the Wide Bay area for grazing country and in November of the same year, with Sydenham and William Glover, made another expedition to the Wide Bay area. They chose land that they named Burrandowan, said to mean \\"big wind\\" in the local Aboriginal dialect. This area was outside the area officially designated for pastoral settlement, however, and so the run was not registered. After a second visit to the area, Russell returned to Cecil Plains, leaving Sydenham and Glover in charge and the new run was stocked with sheep from Cecil Plains in May 1843. Relationships with the local Aboriginal people at Burrandowan were, and continued to be, hostile and shepherds were reluctant to work there. Sydenham and Glover soon became dispirited and left, Sydenham being back in England by 1844. Russell returned to manage the property until he sold it to Captain G.S.N. Living in the same year. In June 1847, Burrandowan was sold to Phillip Friell. In 1848 the Burnett District was officially opened for settlement and tenders for runs were opened. Friell's 1849 application for a lease was accepted in April 1850 and gazetted on 26 July 1851. He made improvements to the property including the surviving buildings, which are thought to have been built around 1848. A homestead was built which included a billiard room and library. Bricks from this homestead remain on the property and are stamped with a heart motif. It is thought that these were made by a local brickmaker, who also made bricks for other stations, including Jimbour, Jondaryan and Boondooma, using a different card suit design for each place. Friell died in 1854 and the property appears to have been managed by Gordon Sandeman, possibly until it was sold to Robert Campbell in May 1860. In the mid-1850s, Burrandowan was reported to be the largest property in the Burnett district, carrying 65 000 sheep. In 1870 it was sold to Robert Towns and Alexander Stuart trading as Towns and Co., Towns holding a number of other properties at the time. In 1872 the run was acquired by Alexander Campbell and John Hay and in the late 1870s was restocked with cattle. In 1885, it passed to the Mercantile Bank of Sydney, which consolidated the run. During the 1890s a series of resumptions for grazing leases began on properties in the area to encourage closer settlement following the 1884 land Act. The core section of the run was leased to the Commercial Bank of Australia in 1900 and sold by them in 1901 to Frederick Borton, who was placed at Burrandowan by the 1874 Queensland Post Office Directory and may have been a manager. Borton immediately transferred the property to George Keppel, Gerald, Mark and Roderick Borton. In 1910, land sales were held of resumed Burrandowan land, which sold quickly as a railway to Nanango was anticipated. In 1917, the final sections of resumed land on this and several other runs in the district were allocated for the Soldier Settlement scheme. Keppel Borton retired and Gerald Borton ran Burrandowan until he died in 1919 when his son managed the property until purchased by a Mr Turner in 1921 and then by Richard Tancred. The current homestead is assembled from three early buildings and is slightly higher and further away from Garden Creek than the previous main house. They are thought to have been assembled in this form around 1927 and comprise the Burrandowan store, part of the homestead and a building relocated from Cooinda, a grazing property formed from Burrandowan land in 1890. Tancred died in 1934 and his widow leased the property to George Lewis who purchased Burrandowan in 1943. The property was subdivided into three sections in 1987 and was purchased in 2001.  Description  The homestead buildings are located in a garden setting without a formal approach drive. They comprise a dwelling in three sections, sheds, a guest cottage, an ant bed tennis court and traces of various other outbuildings just visible above ground. The main residence consists of three buildings; a kitchen and office, a dining room connected to it by a covered way and a bedroom wing. The kitchen building is set on low timber stumps with logs as bearers. It has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron sheeting and the walls are constructed of split and trimmed horizontal slabs dropped between uprights. Windows with multiple panes overlook an area paved with dressed stone blocks, some of which are pecked and have tooled margins. This is shaded on the eastern side by an awning of corrugated iron on a pole frame supported by timber posts. The building is unlined but ceiled with fibrous cement sheeting. It has an early closed stove made by the Scottish firm of Smith and Wellstood and a modern kitchen counter. A door opens from the kitchen into an office which is a separate gable roofed building butted against the kitchen and which has a lower floor. To the west of the kitchen is a passageway with stone paving which leads to the dining room. This is a large rectangular slab building with a gable roof clad in corrugated iron. Verandahs run along both long sides and French windows open onto them. Part of one verandah is used as a servery and part of the other has been enclosed as a bathroom. It has a stone fireplace and a coved ceiling. A wide covered area floored in timber links this to the bedroom wing. This is a gable-roofed rectangular building with three core rooms and is constructed of heavy weatherboards and has French doors. There are now three bedrooms and a sitting room. The verandah area at the rear is enclosed and has a bathroom at one end. Some distance to the west of the main house is a drop log cottage with a new corrugated iron hipped roof and a bullnosed awning supported by timber posts along the front. This contains a modern kitchen and has a weatherboard extension to the rear. The other major building is a large, rectangular shed to the east of the house. It has a steep hipped roof clad in corrugated iron and is also constructed of drop log slabs, is unlined and has a pole frame. One end has a small skillion roofed addition and has an earth floor. It is used as a garage. The adjoining section is separated from this by a drop log partition that reaches only to wall height. The building was originally divided into three rooms and a second partition has been removed, though the frame remains. A pole storage rack has been built against one wall and most of the floor in this area is paved with small blocks of timber placed in irregular rows. The shed has large barn doors at one end with forge-made hinges and fixings. An open shed is situated to the north of the kitchen. It has a hipped corrugated iron roof supported on timber posts. It has some wall sections at the rear that are constructed of slabs. The homestead grounds contain visible traces of outbuildings, and quantities of the dressed stone blocks of unknown provenance that have been used for paving and low seats around the house and garden. Some bricks also remain from the former homestead although few are whole. There is an ant bed tennis court. The grave of Jane Warren, wife of Charles Warren, who died in 1903, can be seen about one kilometre to the south of the homestead, although the path that linked them has vanished. It has a headstone and ornamental metal railings. There are believed to be other graves located nearby, although they are not visible due to vegetation growth.  Heritage listing  Burrandowan Station Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Henry Stuart Russell took up Burrandowan run following his exploration of the Burnett River District in 1842. It was one of the first pastoral runs in the region and provided an impetus for further settlement. Burrandowan homestead illustrates the pattern of early European exploration and settlement of Queensland where the development of pastoral properties preceded agriculture and the establishment of towns. As an early pastoral property, which has remained in continuous use, Burrandowan has important associations with the development of the pastoral industry in Queensland. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Burrandowan has the potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history through historical and archaeological research. The buildings provide evidence of early building techniques and traces of other early structures remain on site and possibly below ground. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Burrandowan homestead complex incorporates structures from the early operation of the station brought together in their current formation in the early 20th century. These include residential and working buildings that are good examples their types and demonstrate the recycling of useful structures commonly made on pastoral properties. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Burrandowan homestead complex has aesthetic significance, comprising structures that are well made examples of traditional buildings that are pleasing in form, materials and detail. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Burrandowan homestead has special associations with the life and work of Henry Stuart Russell who took up the run, with Philip Friell who was responsible for the construction of the buildings and with members of the Borton family of whom three generations worked on the property.

Life Arrivabene was born in 1787 in Mantua, which in 1815 became part of the Austrian-ruled Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia. He opposed Austrian rule in Italy, and in 1821 was arrested on suspicion of being a member of the revolutionary secret society of Carbonari, but was released for lack of evidence.R. Van Nuffel, \\"Arrivabene, Jean\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 29 (Brussels, 1956), 150-153. He went into voluntary exile, first in France, then in England (where he became friends with James Mill, Thomas Tooke and John Ramsay McCulloch), and finally in Belgium, where he associated with Sylvain Van de Weyer, F√©lix de M√©rode, Adolphe Quetelet, and √âdouard Ducp√©tiaux. Arrivabene bought a house in Brussels in 1829, and in 1834 was among the founders of the Free University of Brussels. He was naturalised as a Belgian citizen in 1841, and in 1845 he was appointed to a royal commission on improving the condition of workers. From 1850 to 1854 he served as a provincial councillor for the Province of Brabant. He was a prolific though not particularly original writer in the field of political economy, and a founding member and first president of the Belgian Society for Political Economy (established 1855). In 1860, following the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Solferino, Arrivabene was appointed to the Senate of the Kingdom of Sardinia. For his remaining years he divided his time between Italy and Belgium. He was a recipient of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. He died in Mantua in 1881.

Life and education  Irving was born in Boston, Massachusetts on 3 May 1895. He started his university education at Bowdoin College, where he gained a Bachelor of Science degree in 1916. Directly after graduation from Bowdoin he entered Harvard University where he obtained an MA in physiology in 1917. Following completion of his war service, Irving began a PhD at Stanford University. Irving commenced his teaching career at Stanford in 1925 when he was appointed as an instructor. In 1928, he accepted a post as associate professor at the University of Toronto in the Department of Physiology. In 1931, he was appointed professor of experimental biology at Toronto. He remained in Toronto until 1937. After leaving Canada, Irving spent the next 12 years teaching and researching at Swarthmore College, as a professor in the Department of Biology and chairman of their Zoology Department. While at Swarthmore, Irving began to correspond with the Norwegian biologist Per F. Scholander, and had assisted August Krogh in arranging for Scholander to receive a Rockefeller fellowship. The fellowship was awarded for a collaboration on diving physiology between Scholander and Irving. When World War II broke out leaving Scholander stranded in Norway, Irving and Krogh managed to arrange for Scholander's urgent immigration. This would prove to be a profitable academic relationship for both Scholander and Irving, as they continued to collaborate until Irving's death. In 1947, after returning to Swarthmore from his war service, Irving was appointed scientific director at the then-new Naval Arctic Research Laboratory in Barrow, Alaska. Two years later he was appointed the chief of the physiology section of the Arctic Health Research Center in Anchorage, where he began his pioneering research into arctic biology. In November 1962, the National Academy of Sciences recommended the creation of the Institute of Arctic Biology. Irving was then appointed its first head, remaining in post until stepping down in 1966. He remained an advisory scientific director there and regularly attended seminars until his death in 1979. In 1968 Irving was conferred an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Alaska. Irving was given the Arctic Institute of North America's Fellows Award in 1974 for \\"long and distinguished research in physiology of arctic life\\". He died on 20 November 1979 in Fairbanks, Alaska, aged 84. = War service = During World War I Irving served in the U.S. Army, where he rose to the rank of first lieutenant by 1919. He had joined up with the American Expeditionary Force in 1917 on completion of his MA. After the United States' entry into World War II, Irving joined the Army Air Corps. He remained there from 1943 until 1946 as chief physiologist,. Irving completed his World War II service at the rank of lieutenant colonel.  Personal life  Irving and his wife Florence had three children. His daughter, Susan, and two sons, William and Laurence. His children settled across North America, and at his death were living in California, Alaska and Canada. Irving maintained many international personal and professional relationships. After the death of professor Gustav Embden in 1936, Irving worked to secure the immigration of his daughter, Maja Embden, into Canada, allowing her to escape the rise of the Nazi regime. T.D. Simpson indicated that Irving also assisted a number of other German-Jewish scientists during this period prior to the war. In 1951, his daughter Susan had married her father's former PhD student and longtime scientific collaborator, Per F. Scholander. Susan was also a biologist, publishing as Susan Irving Scholander and Susan I. Scholander.  Legacy  In 1971, the University of Alaska built a new building to house the Institute of Marine Sciences, joining the existing facility opened in 1965. These buildings were designated Biosciences I and II. On 16 August 1971 the buildings were jointly rededicated as the Laurence Irving Building for the Biosciences I and II in honor of Irving.

Burke (born September 18, 1925) is a lunar settlement and exploration expert. He is known for being the first program manager of the Ranger Program, and considered one of the pioneers of America's space program Early life and career Burke grew up in Claremont, California. Graduated from Webb High School in 1942. In 1945, after graduating in mechanical engineering from California Institute of Technology, he became a U.S. Naval Aviator. Burke returned to CalTech to receive his MSc in Aeronatics, before coming to work for JPL in 1949. In his time in JPL, Burke was the Vega program director, developing the third stage of the general-purpose Vega launch vehicle, which was based on the Atlas rocket. Following JPL transfer from the U.S. Navy to NASA, and reorganization during early 1960, the Lunar and Planetary Program were created. Burke was named deputy of the Lunar Program under Clifford Cummings, before becoming the Ranger Spacecraft Project Manager as well. Ranger Program Program Ranger Organization Chart, Burke is highlighted Ranger Program officials Assembled for the Ranger 5 Postlaunch Press Conference at Cape Canaveral. Left to Right: Friedrich Duerr, Major J. Mulladay, Lt. Col. Jack Albert, Kurt Debus, William Cunningham, and James Burke Burke was the first program manager of the Ranger program, a series of unmanned space missions by the United States in the 1960s whose objective was to obtain the first close-up images of the surface of the Moon. The Ranger spacecraft were designed to take images of the lunar surface, transmitting those images to Earth until the spacecraft were destroyed upon impact. Burke was in charge of spacecraft design, deep space tracking and control network, space flight operations and data reduction support systems, while the Space Science Division was in charge of the scientific experiments. Burke could combine the technological and theoretical to integrate mechanical and electrical features to achieve the difficult technical objectives. Along with his two associates, Burke had solved the major guidance problem, velocity control, associated with solid-propellant ballistic missiles. He was recognized as one of the Laboratory's most perceptive research engineers, and advanced to become deputy to Cummings on the Vega Program. Technical difficulties and challenges, led to the failure of the first six flights. Following the first five failures, H.M. Schurmeier became project manager. The ranger program suffered an additional failure before Ranger 7 was successful. Burke participated in many other lunar, planetary and astrophysical projects. He was a member of the human-powered flight team that won the Kremer prize. Burke continued to work in JPL until his retirement in 2001. Minor planet 4874 Burke, discovered by Eleanor Helin is named after him, when he retired from JPL. Outreach and education Burke was a faculty member of the International Space University since 1989. Burke and his wife, Caroline (Lin), were advisers at the founding conference of the Space Generation Advisory Council during UNISPACE III in Vienna and have participated in many Space Generation activities.

Reger described this suite, composed and first performed in 1912, and the Vier Tondichtungen nach A. B√∂cklin, Op. 128, as \\"Ausflug in das Gebiet der Programmusik\\" (Excursion in the realm of program music).  History  Reger composed the suite in Meiningen during May and June 1912. He was director of music of the Hofkapelle there from 1911 to 1914, and wrote most of his compositions for orchestra during this time. He dedicated the work to Hugo Gr√ºters. During composition time, Reger already offered the premiere to Ernst von Schuch, who had successfully conducted the premiere of Der Rosenkavalier in 1911, and who had a passion for contemporary music. Schuch programmed works by Regers regularly from 1906 for the K√∂nigliche musikalische Kapelle (Royal Chapel) in Dresden, and had engaged Reger as the pianist for Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in 1911. Reger dedicated his Lustspiel-Ouvert√ºre, Op. 120, to the conductor in return. The score and parts of Eine romantische Suite were published by Bote & Bock in September 1912. The suite was first performed on 11 October 1912 in the first symphony concert of the Royal Chapel that season, conducted by Ernst von Schuch. Arnold Sch√∂nberg wrote in 1920 an arrangement of the suite for chamber ensemble. Reger's suite was published as part of his complete works in volume 4, orchestral works IV (S√§mtliche Werke, Band 4: Orchesterwerke IV) by Breitkopf & H√§rtel in Wiesbaden in 1962.  Structure and scoring  The suite is structured in three movements, with two slow movements framing a vivid scherzo. # Notturno (Molto sostenuto) # Scherzo (Vivace) # Finale (Molto sostenuto) The three movements correspond to three poems by Joseph von Eichendorff, \\"Nachtzauber\\" (Night magic), \\"Elfe\\" (Fairy) and \\"Adler\\" (Eagle). While Reger originally wanted to name the movements as the poems, he thought about similar titles (\\"Mondnacht\\", \\"Elfentanz\\" and \\"Helios\\") but finally chose neutral titles. Reger scored the work for a symphonic orchestra of three flutes, two oboes, cor Anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, three trumpets, four horns, three trombones, tuba, harp, three timpani, cymbal and strings.

It is 7 km from the nearby railway station. This small locality has developed since an Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) was added. The area was once out of the way of Shimla people. It has become a popular place well connected by roads. Though situated on the outskirts, the transport system, ISBT, makes the area easily reachable.  History  Tutikandi was once an untouched part of Shimla. Dense, thick forest covers much of the region. For many years it served as a garbage dump. Its location was one major reason for choosing it as a dumping site. With the expansion the dumping site was relocated.  Today  Tutikandi serves as a bypass road.

The episode was written by Jamie Brittain, and was directed by Harry Enfield. The episode focuses on Tony (Nicholas Hoult). Since the accident, Tony lives isolated and alone in a world of half-understood dreams. He tries to act normal, but bumping into Sid (Mike Bailey) and Michelle (April Pearson) at a club sends him spiralling again.  Plot  Tony is awoken by a nightmare and calls for Effy (Kaya Scodelario) to comfort him. She reads him a story about Orpheus and Eurydice. Later, Tony visits the club where he meets with his friends, who unwittingly reveal that while Tony was recovering, his ex- girlfriend Michelle and his best friend Sid had gotten together. Cassie (Hannah Murray), Sid's ex-girlfriend, gives Tony some ecstasy and proposes that they go on a date to get back at Sid and Michelle. However, Tony reveals to Cassie that he was having trouble being intimate after his accident. Tony starts to confront Sid and Michelle manically, but runs off to vomit in the bathrooms. There, he meets a beautiful girl (credited as Beth) who notices that he is having a panic attack and asks him if he is a \\"fighter or flighter.\\" Back in the club, Tony watches Sid watch Cassie kiss a stranger, and runs home. The next day, Sid and Michelle visit Tony to try to make amends with him, who is hiding under his bed. He repeats that he is fine with their relationship and asks the two to leave because he has an interview. On the train to his interview, Tony finds a man with a large scar in a uniform sitting in front of him. The man volunteers the story of how he set himself on fire and got the burns. At the college, Polly and Derek, the eccentric campus tour guides, lead Tony and the other students around the school. Tony is late to the group session, where the lecturer, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the scarred man, is critical of Tony. Tony finds the girl from the club sitting three chairs away from him, who accuses the lecturer of trying to sleep with the college students. The girl leaves, followed by Tony. They walk around campus and the girl pushes him into the pool, despite his protests. She tells him to just float, which alleviates his fears. Later, Tony is found alone in the pool by Polly and Derek, who advise him not to follow the girl. Tony encounters the girl again on the tour, where she leads him into a lab full of fragile equipment and instructs him to walk across the room in the dark. Tony breaks the equipment, setting off an alarm, and the girl helps Tony run away by leading him to a dorm. In the dorm, they find Matt and Toby, who encourage Tony to smoke with them. The four all undress to their underwear, and Matt reveals a large tattoo design on his back. The girl is intrigued and asks him to tattoo her as well. She invites Tony to touch her, and berates him for not being able to have sex, saying he isn't trying hard enough. Angry, Tony leaves the dorm and visits the lecturer for his interview, where the lecturer lists all of Tony's antics at the school. The lecturer taunts Tony for not being original, and Tony responds by crudely insulting him and telling him that he doesn't want to end up like him. Tony returns to the dorm, where Matt and Toby congratulate him and leave. He has sex with the girl, and afterwards she affectionately tells him not to look back. Back from the university, Tony goes to the club to find Sid and Michelle having sex in the bathroom. He proclaims that he loves both Sid and Michelle, but that it is wrong for them to be together because Sid loves Cassie, and Tony and Michelle love each other. Tony goes home and goes to bed, revealing the girl's tattoo on his back.  Production  The scenes at the university were shot at the University of Exeter. Jamie Brittain, co-creator of the show, claims that this was his favorite episode to write: \\"I kept expecting someone to tell me to stop, to reign in the craziness, but no one did. I watched it fairly recently and I am very proud of how seriously f‚Äìking mental it is.\\" Nicholas Hoult praises Harry Enfield's direction of the sex scene, saying, \\"it was quite nice. Harry's a great bloke. He had a great vision for the scene. He knew what he wanted.\\"  Reception  This episode was watched by 751,000 people in the UK.

It was built in 1873 for Moses Webster, owner of one of Vinalhaven's granite quarries, and is one of the community's finest examples of Second Empire architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The Moses Webster House stands on the east side of Vinalhaven's downtown area, at the northeast corner of Atlantic Avenue and Frog Hollow Road. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof, clapboarded walls, and a granite foundation. Its front facade is six bays wide, with a projecting two-bay section on the left side, capped by a three-story mansarded tower. The leftmost bay has a two-story polygonal window bay with a gabled top and bracketed cornices, while a single-story porch extends across the right four bays and wraps around to the right side. It is supported by chamfered square posts and has a low balustrade. Second-floor windows rise through the lower portion of the mansard roof as wall dormers, and are topped by bracketed and pedimented gables. with The house was built in 1873 for Moses Webster, who was, along with Joseph R. Bodwell, a leading figure in Vinalhaven's highly successful late 19th-century granite industry. The two men, both New Hampshire natives, came to Vinalhaven in 1851, and began the expansion of its previously small-scale granite quarries, eventually providing stone for major buildings along the Atlantic coast. The Bodwell Granite Company, of which Webster was president and co- owner, dominated the island's economy into the early 20th century. The house served as a bed and breakfast inn in the early 2010s, and was listed for sale in 2016.

Cherry (born ca. 1941) is the recipient of the 2016 Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize, awarded at Singapore International Water Week in July 2016 for his work in groundwater research, protection and management. He is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. He undertook research on the migration of contaminants in groundwater and he participated in the development of technologies for groundwater monitoring and remediation thus \\"revolutionizing groundwater research\\". His research resulted in a \\"paradigm shift in groundwater pollution control measures\\", leading to new groundwater remediation guidelines to be adopted in the United States and other countries in the 1990s. He holds geological engineering degrees from the University of Saskatchewan and University of California Berkeley, and earned a PhD in geology with specialization in hydrogeology from the University of Illinois. In 1967 he joined the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, as the country's first groundwater professor. He then joined the faculty at the University of Waterloo in 1971 where he held the Research Chair in Contaminant Hydrogeology from 1996 to 2006. In 1978 he led a group of researchers in setting up the Borden Groundwater Field Research Facility on a landfill located within a military base. The field research at Borden demonstrated the behavior of contaminants and the remediation process in a way that non- scientists and policy-makers could understand and accept. This research formed the basis for criteria for selecting sites for safe waste disposal. These criteria were subsequently incorporated into regulatory frameworks all around the world. In 1979 he co-authored the first edition of the seminal textbook \\"Groundwater\\" with Professor R. Allan Freeze. The book helped readers see how the \\"pieces are connected\\" and get a more holistic understanding of the complicated subject. In 1987, he founded the University Consortium for Field- Focused Groundwater Research which consists of 26 principal investigators and 12 core corporate sponsors. Currently comprising 16 universities, it gives graduate students the chance to conduct research on contaminated industrial sites, much as John Cherry had done himself before. He co-holds several patents, is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, and a Fellow of the Geological Society of America. His career choice was influenced by his parents who had experienced a severe drought in of Saskatchewan in the 1930s and who became documentary filmmakers, making films about water, reminding their son how important water scarcity was. According to Cherry, \\"the biggest cause of groundwater pollution and of water use not being sustainable is agriculture\\". Out of concern for environmental sustainability, he became a vegan in 2010. Noting that 80 percent of all freshwater is used for food production, Cherry said in his acceptance speech of the Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize that \\"eating meat is the largest single contributor to the global water crisis. Diet changes could reduce per capita water consumption in the industrialized countries by up to 40 percent.\\" He also noted that 50 percent of drinking water supplies globally depend on groundwater.\\" Cherry has also urged governments to devote more of their budget to groundwater monitoring, noting that unlike sewage treatment, it is not as politically popular because its benefits appear only over the long term. Cherry plans to use the S$ 300,000 (USD 222,000) prize money of the Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize to update the \\"Groundwater\\" textbook, translating it into different languages and putting it online as a \\"wiki book\\".

Biography  Bossi studied law under Professor Carlo Denina whom he befriended. Dealing simultaneously with literature, he gave two tragedies at the age of 18, the Circassians and Rhea-Sylvia which were well received. Then he published Odes on the reforms of Joseph II, on the death of the young prince of Brunswick, on American Independence, the pacification of Holland, which increased his poet's reputation, but the philosophical sentiments contained in the odes displeased the court of Turin, and undermined his advancement in a first time. However he was appointed Secretary of Legation at Genoa, then undersecretary for foreign affairs, before being charg√© d'affaires to the Russian court, where he remained until the signing of the armistice of Cherasco April 28, 1796, between Sardinia and France, when the Tsar Paul I ordered him to leave Russia. When the French invaded Italy in 1796, he showed willingness to serve and participated in the negotiations of the Treaty of Campo Formio. In 1799, general Joubert appointed him a member of the provisional government of Piedmont, as undersecretary of Foreign Affairs. After the battle of Marengo, he went to Holland to meet the resident functions. When he learned of the Piedmont states sale that had been made to France, he went to Turin and determined the heads of the Italian party for the meeting. When the Austro-Russians penetrated in Italy, he retired into the valleys of the Alps, where he received the most generous hospitality. In order to recognize this welcome, Bossi signaled his entry into the government by an act which gave the Vaudois full freedom of worship. He contributes a lot to the final integration of Piedmont to France, and the First Consul reflected his satisfaction with a flattering letter. Nevertheless, he merely named him resident in Moldova. Bossi, who expected to be employed in the administration refused and would be forgotten for 18 months. After this time he was called to the prefecture of Ain in 1805, then to that of Manche 12 February 1810 until 16 July 1815. Made a baron of the Empire by Napol√©on 9 March 1809, Louis XVIII kept him in office at the Bourbon Restoration and granted him letters of naturalization, but his eagerness to recognize Bonaparte on his return from Elba, led to his dismissal. After traveling for some time in northern Europe, he settled at 14 rue Saint-Martin (), where he died. An officier of the L√©gion d'honneur, he is buried at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. From Anne Spanzotti, married 5 November 1806 in Bourg-en-Bresse, he had a daughter named Heloise, born July 14, 1809 in Bourg-en-Bresse, who first married with Eug√®ne Leroux. Widowed, she remarried with Caesar-Maurice de la Tour d'Auvergne, and had the Carmel of the Pater Noster built in Jerusalem. His poems were collected, Turin, 1801 3 small vol., and reprinted in London in 1814 to 50 copies only, with a poem entitled Oromasia, and whose subject is the French Revolution. Despite the independence of the author, the poem was in favor of Bonaparte. There is strength in ideas, but the versification is lackluster and the general effect monotonous.

Built in 1900 by the local Grange chapter and the Whitefield Fish and Game Club, it has served for more than a century as a major social meeting point. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The Whitefield Union Hall stands on the west side of Townhouse Road, a short way north of its junction with Pittston Road (Maine State Route 194). The small village in which it stands is largely unaltered, having only lost a mill complex (and major local source of jobs) to a hurricane in 1954. The building is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with Victorian styling. It is basically L-shaped, with a rectangular main block from which a recessed ell projects to the right. The exterior of the main block is finished in wooden clapboards on the first floor, and with fish-scale shingles above, while the ell is finished in clapboards. The main entrance is at the center of the three-bay facade, flanked by windows that have modest projecting cornices. Similar windows are on the second floor, and there is in the gable end a double window topped by a gabled cornice. The interior of the hall is divided into function spaces, with a dining room and kitchen on the ground floor, and an auditorium with stage on the second floor. with The hall was built in 1900, primarily under the auspices of the Whitefield Fish and Game Club, but with design input from the local Grange chapter, which contributed funds to its construction and was also a major tenant. It was until 1919 the only public hall with a stage in southern Whitefield, playing host to dances, meetings of fraternal and social organizations, and other community events. The hall was managed by an association of the two organizations until 1947, and by the Fish and Game Club after the Grange chapter merged with another in 1969. The club closed down in 1974, and the hall is now managed by a union consortium of village community groups.

He served as both Minister of the Navy and Minister of Foreign Affairs and was a recipient of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. In his naval career, he was best known for his actions during the Italian Wars of Independence and later as commander of the International Squadron off Crete in 1897‚Äì1898. Biography The descendant of a Ligurian family originally from Zoagli, Canevaro was born in Lima, Peru, to Giuseppe and Francesca Velaga. =Naval career= In 1852, Canevaro was admitted to the Kingdom of Sardinia's Royal Navy School at Genoa, completing the course of instruction in 1855 and receiving a commission as an ensign second class. Italian Wars of Independence In 1859, with the rank of second lieutenant, Canevaro took part in Royal Sardinian Navy operations in the Adriatic Sea aboard the transport Beroldo and the sailing frigate during the Second Italian War of Independence. In 1860, Canevaro arrived in Palermo, Sicily, aboard , the flagship of the Sardinian squadron. When the supporters of the Italian nationalist leader General Giuseppe Garibaldi organized their navy, he resigned from the Royal Sardinian Navy to enlist in the Garibaldian navy. Aboard the steam frigate Tukory on the night of 13 August 1860, Canevaro distinguished himself during an unsuccessful attempt to board the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies steam ship-of-the-line Monarca while she was anchored in the port of Castellammare di Stabia. He received the Silver Medal of Military Valor for his actions during this engagement. In the autumn of 1860, Canevarro was reinstated in the Royal Sardinian Navy. While embarked on the Sardinian steam frigate from December 1860 to March 1861, he took part in the Siege of Gaeta and a siege of Messina during operations in which Carlo Alberto repeatedly exchanged fire with hostile forces at close range along the coast. After the campaign, he was made a Knight of the Military Order of Savoy, and in 1863, he was promoted to luogotenente de vascello. In 1865‚Äì1866, Canevaro was on board the steam frigate , under the command Guglielmo Acton, during a long cruise that included a transatlantic voyage, operations along the Atlantic coast of South America, a transit of the Strait of Magellan into the Pacific Ocean, and steaming up the coast of Chile. officers of the battleship pose under a pair of her guns. On returning to Italy, he was assigned to the broadside ironclad , commanded by Augusto Riboty. Aboard Re di Portogallo, he took part in 1866 in the Third Italian War of Independence, during which the ship was engaged in operations against the fortress of Lissa in the Adriatic Sea. As flagship of the 3rd Division, and with Canevaro aboard as the division's chief-of-staff, Re di Portogallo led the division's attack on Porto San Giorgio on 18 July 1866.

Illustration as it appeared in The Graphic on 13 March 1897 of warships of the International Squadron bombarding Christian insurgents above Chania, Crete, on 21 February 1897. It probably is reversed. Battle of Lissa On 20 July 1866, Re di Portogallo played a particularly prominent role in the Battle of Lissa against the Austrian fleet. She first opened fire on the Austrian steam corvette , scoring a hit below the waterline that opened a leak that caused more water to enter Erzherzog Friedrich than her pumps could handle, forcing Erzherzog Friedrich to retreat in the direction of Lissa. While chasing the damaged Erzherzog Friedrich, Re di Portogallo sighted the Austrian steam ship- of-the-line , which, although seriously damaged by a broadside fired by the Italian ironclad ram , was approaching to defend Erzherzog Friedrich.Ermanno Martino, Lissa 1866: perch√©? in Storia Militare n. 214 and 215, July‚ÄìAugust 2011 (Italian). Re di Portogallo attempted to ram Kaiser, but Kaiser steered toward Re di Portogallo and the two ships collided violently head-on. Kaiser had the worst of the collision, which badly damaged her bow, destroyed her bowsprit, and left her figurehead, a wooden statue of the Austrian emperor Kaiser Franz Joseph I, stuck in the hull of Re di Portogallo; it became an Italian war trophy. Entangled with Kaiser, Re di Portogallo pummeled her with gunfire at close range, inflicting many casualties on her crew and bringing down her foresail, which crashed onto her funnel. Re di Portogallo put her engines astern to pull away from Kaiser and maneuver to ram her again, but could not resume her attack because smoke had concealed Kaiser, which the officers of Re di Portogallo mistakenly believed may have sunk. As the battle continued Re di Portogallo found herself surrounded by four Austrian ships, but she managed to escape from them thanks to the ability of her commander, Riboty. One of the Italian ships most heavily involved in the battle, Re di Portogallo suffered serious damage, including the loss of her anchors and some of her boats and having of her armor dislodged, most of this damage occurring during the duel with Kaiser. Although the outcome of the Battle of Lissa ultimately was disastrous for the Italian fleet, Canevaro received a second award of the Silver Medal for Military Valor, while Re di Portogallos commanding officer Riboty received the Gold Medal of Military Valor.marina.difesa.it Augusto Riboty 1870s‚Äì1890s Promoted to capitano di fregata in 1869, Canevaro served as a naval attach√© at the Italian embassy in London from March 1874 to August 1876. From January 1877 to March 1879, while in command of the cruiser , he circumnavigated the globe, departing Italy, transiting the Suez Canal, skirting Asia, visiting ports in China and the Netherlands East Indies ‚Äì where Colombo recovered the body of the Italian general and politician Nino Bixio, who had died of cholera in Banda Aceh on Sumatra in 1873 ‚Äì and then went on to Japan, Russia (including Siberia), Australia and the Americas. After transiting the Strait of Magellan into the Atlantic Ocean, Colombo steamed up the coast of South America to the Caribbean, then crossed the Atlantic to return to Italy. Promoted to capitano di vascello, Canevaro performed various important duties, including service as chief-of-staff of the 3rd Maritime Department headquartered at Venice, second- in-command of the Italian Naval Academy, and commanding officer of the ironclad battleship . In 1884, while in command of Italia, he played an active role in humanitarian work and public health during a cholera epidemic in La Spezia, and he received the Silver Medal for Civil Valor for these efforts. Promoted to counter admiral (the equivalent of rear admiral) in 1887, Canevaro assumed command of the arsenal of Taranto and later of the 2nd Naval Division of the Permanent Squadron. He was promoted to vice admiral in 1893, and King Umberto I appointed him a Senator of the Kingdom of Italy ‚Äì an appointment for life ‚Äì in 1896, the same year in which he assumed command of the Regia Marinas Naval Squadron. International Squadron In February 1897, when a Christian uprising against the authority of the Ottoman Empire broke out on the island of Crete, Canevaro arrived at Crete in command of the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron, consisting of the ironclad battleships (his flagship) and , the protected cruiser , and the torpedo cruiser . Canevaro ‚Äì who relieved the commander of the Italian naval squadron, Rear Admiral Gualterio, who had previously been in command of the 2nd Naval Division ‚Äì assumed command of the International Squadron of warships off Crete on 16 or 17 February 1897 (sources differ) as the most senior admiral present, and took up duties as president of the \\"Admirals Council,\\" which consisted of the senior admirals present off Crete of each of the six countries participating in the International Squadron. The squadron put landing detachments ashore, but Christian insurgents continued to attack Ottoman forces and Canevaro soon ordered International Squadron ships to bombard them during February and March 1897 to stop the fighting. Although some political opponents in the Italian legislature attacked him for ordering the International Squadron to bombard the insurgents, Canevaro received great credit during his time in command of the squadron for his ability to exercise diplomacy and mediate disputes between the six Great Powers ‚Äì Austria-Hungary, France, the German Empire, Italy, the Russian Empire, and the United Kingdom ‚Äì making up the squadron and for the way in which he dealt with the confusing and anarchic situation on Crete, balancing humanitarian compassion and a spirit of conciliation in his dealings with Greek, Christian insurgent, and Ottoman forces on the island with the occasional need to use force to halt fighting and quell disturbances. Before leaving the International Squadron in 1898, Canevaro negotiated an agreement under which all combat on Crete would cease and Greece and the Ottoman Empire would withdraw their forces from the island in anticipation of the creation of an autonomous Cretan State under the suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan. Such was his reputation that when the creation of an office of High Commissioner of the Cretan State was proposed in the spring of 1898, Canevaro received an invitation to become the first high commissioner, but he declined the offer, and instead Prince George of Greece and Denmark became the first high commissioner when the Cretan State finally came into existence in December 1898. =Government minister= When Prime Minister of Italy Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudin√¨, formed the government for his fifth ministry, Canevaro turned over command of the International Squadron to its next-most- senior admiral, Rear Admiral √âdouard Pottier of the French Navy, and returned to Italy to serve as di Rudini‚Ä≤s Minister of the Navy. Taking office on 1 June 1898, he served only four weeks, until the di Rudini government was replaced on 29 June 1898 by that of Prime Minister General Luigi Pelloux. On the same day Pelloux took office, Canevaro changed portfolios to become the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs. In his new role, he attempted to continue Italy‚Ä≤s policy of loyalty to the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and the German Empire and of continued warm relations with the United Kingdom, but at the same time worked toward relaxing tensions with France, and he conducted secret negotiations with the French for a commercial treaty, which the countries signed on 26 November 1898. He also resisted pressure from Germany to change the status of the Cretan State, supporting its continuation as an autonomous state under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. However, despite his successes in negotiations on Crete while in command of the International Squadron, Canevaro's talent for leading military forces did not translate into success in international diplomacy when it came to larger issues. During the Fashoda Crisis of 1899 between France and the United Kingdom, Canevaro conducted intensive diplomacy as part of the ongoing European \\"Scramble for Africa\\" in an effort to gain French and British recognition of an Italian interest in Libya, but when the French and British concluded an agreement on 21 March 1899 that resolved the crisis, they offered no such recognition. Canevaro also was unsuccessful when in the wake of a number of anarchist attacks in Europe ‚Äì one of which resulted in the stabbing death of Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary Elizabeth on 10 September 1898 ‚Äì he proposed an international anti-anarchist conference of diplomats and government security and judicial officials to address the situation; although some countries agreed to participate, the conference never took place. A final blow to Canevaro's diplomatic career came in the \\"San Mun Affair\\" of 1899, in which Italy demanded that the Chinese Empire grant it a lease for a naval coaling station at China's Sanmen Bay (known as \\"San-Mun Bay\\" to the Italians) similar to the lease the German Empire had secured in 1898 at Kiaochow Bay. From Sanmen Bay, Italy hoped to establish an area of influence in Chekiang. The Russian Empire and the United States opposed the Italian demand, but the Italian ambassador in China, Renato De Martino, led Canevaro to believe that the area was ripe for the taking. The British government, although ambivalent toward the Italian move, gave its approval as long as Italy did not use force against the Chinese, but the British did not inform Canevaro that the United Kingdom‚Ä≤s representatives in China had advised that Italy could not achieve its goals without using force. Believing the opportunity to pursue Italy's interests in China was at hand, Canevaro had de Martino pass Italy‚Ä≤s demands to the Chinese imperial government in the winter of 1899, but the Chinese summarily rejected them on 4 March 1899. On 8 March, Canevaro instructed De Martino to present the demands again as an ultimatum and authorized the armored cruiser Marco Polo and protected cruiser Elba to occupy the bay. When the British ambassador in Rome reminded him that the United Kingdom did not support an Italian use of force, Canevaro issued a counterorder cancelling his authorization to use the two cruisers in the bay, but De Martino received the counterorder before he received the original authorization to employ the ships. Unable to decipher the counterorder, De Martino presented the Italian ultimatum to China again on 10 March 1899, and China immediately refused to comply. Italy withdrew its ultimatum, becoming at the end of the 19th century the first and only Western power to fail to achieve its territorial goals in China. The fiasco was an embarrassment that gave Italy ‚Äì still stung by its defeat at the hands of the Ethiopian Empire in the Battle of Adowa in 1896 ‚Äì the appearance of a third-rate power. On 14 March 1899, Canevaro attempted to present the affair to the Italian Parliament in a positive light, saying that be believed that China had rejected the Italian ultimatum in order to maintain a positive and productive relationship with Italy uninterrupted by negotiations over the bay, but such was the domestic criticism of the Italian failure as a humiliation and international criticism of it as a needless and unjustified provocation that Pelloux announced the resignation of his entire cabinet on 14 May 1899. He excluded Canevaro from the new cabinet he established that day. =Later naval service= Canevaro returned to the navy, commanding the 3rd Maritime District from 16 July 1900 to 16 January 1902 and presiding over the Supreme Council of the Navy from 16 January 1902 until 6 July 1903. He then retired and was placed on the reserve list, although in retirement he was promoted to vice admiral of the navy on 1 December 1923. He died at Venice on 30 December 1926.

She did not attend court daily but only on state functions and important events, such as state dinners. She did, however, make a formal visit to the Tuilieres each day when Eugenie was in Paris, to learn the empress' wishes, and then leave again.Comte Fleury: Memoirs Of The Empress Eugenie Vol-I, 1920 It was noted how she often saved the empress from making a blunder with her naming list, as the functions Eugenie was required to host was so large that she often forgot the names of her guests. She accompanied the emperor and empress on the state visit to Great Britain in 1857. She was also a well connected society hostess, and her \\"elegant and eclectic salon\\" in the Rue Jean Goujon was \\"one of the most charming centers of polite Paris\\". Anne d'Essling has been described as thin and fragile to her appearance, and stiff, formal and proud to her behavior, though closer acquaintances saw her as friendly and intelligent. She was described in retrospect: :Pretty and refined in appearance, with an exceedingly lofty manner, though small in stature, the Princesse d'Essling occupied througbout tbo entire duration of the empire the biggest position in her Majesty's servico. Scrupulously particular regarding her dignity, she never went out unless she rode in state. [...] She was the sort of woman to mount the beps of the scaffold -with dignity, like the ladies of Marie- Antoinette's court. She seemed, on first acquaintance, somewhat stiff and formal, but was in reality extremely kindhearted and intelligent. After the war, being old land feeble, she withdrew almost entirely from social activity, but the number of friends who still clung to her and who remained her faithful adherents proved the high esteem in which she was held.Carette Madame: Recollections of the court of the Tuileries (1890) She remained in service until the fall of the monarchy and was present with the Empress in the Tuileries Palace during the fall of the Second Empire in 1870. She then retired from high society life. Legacy She belongs to the ladies-in- waiting depicted with Eugenie in the famous painting Empress Eug√©nie Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting by Franz Xaver Winterhalter from 1855.

Initially conceived as the second part of a double album to their 2009 release Ursa Major, the album was delayed, and eventually shelved, due to legal issues between frontman Stephan Jenkins and then-guitarist of the band Tony Fredianelli. The subsequent re-staffing the band with mostly new members in 2011 and 2012 led Jenkins to shy away from releasing the material, stating that it no longer represented the current band lineup - though comments from as recent as 2015 have alluded to releasing some of the music online eventually as well. Background Information on an album titled Ursa Minor arose as early as March 2009, from Billboard magazine. The band later revealed more upon discussing the release of their then upcoming fourth studio album, Ursa Major, in May 2009 with Billboard. The band had been working on material sporadically since their prior album, Out of the Vein, had been released in 2003, and had accumulated a wealth of material, leading to the plan of releasing it all as a double album; Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. Fredianelli described the original concept: > \\"It's kind of like the big dipper and the little dipper. It's not > necessarily like the big songs on Ursa Major. There's going to be some great > songs on Ursa Minor, too. It's just a matter of how they fit together in the > collage. Certain songs share certain spots on the record. Records are kind > of like a piece of art, you don't want to add too much blue, ebbing and > flowing through. It seems like the two records are fitting together in a > certain way. However, with work on Ursa Minor material not being complete, plans changed to releasing them as two separate but companion type fourth and fifth albums. Ursa Major was released on August 18, 2009, with Ursa Minor having a tentative release scheduled for later in the same year. However, focus on touring in support of Ursa Major pushed the release back, while work on the album continued through 2010 and 2011. In April 2010, Brad Hargreaves stated that they were continuing to flesh out the material for it, and in July 2010, the band announced they had re-entered the studio to continue work on the album. By January 2011, the band had returned to touring, though Jenkins continued to state at concerts that the band was planning on returning to the material to complete Ursa Minor. Aftermath and future By the end of 2012, it was reported that Jenkins had ultimately dropped the Ursa Minor album idea. Jenkins revealed that the change in plans had been a result of changes in band members since the release of Ursa Major. Much of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor had been written with guitarist Tony Fredianelli, who after the release of Ursa Major, sued the band for missing song-writing credits and publishing royalties for Ursa Major and the Red Star EP. Fredianelli had many of the claims dismissed, but ultimately still won over $400,000 from the band for lost wages in touring in support of Ursa Major. With his departure stemming from the lawsuits, he was replaced with guitarist Kryz Reid. The band also recruited new bassist Alex LeCavalier - the position had previously been filled by various session and touring members - and Alex Kopp, the band's first dedicated keyboardist. In 2013, Jenkins stated that, after all the said events, the material no longer reflected the current state of the band, and declared it \\"shelved\\" at the time, with the possibility of release in the future. The band's eventual fifth album, Dopamine, released in June 2015, had no connection to any material from Ursa Minor. In July 2015, Jenkins reiterated this stance, stating that although the material no longer represented the band's current form, he also felt that the individual songs were so strong, that he intends on potentially releasing them online on a track by track basis.

Reforms in the Ministry of Justice  =Registration of businesses and real estate= On April 30, 2016, the reform of the state registration of business and real estate was accomplished. The Minister of Justice Pavlo Petrenko de-monopolized and decentralized the state registration of business and real estate. Before the reform, the functions of business and real estate registration were performed by the Ministry's 529 regional offices. On May 1, 2016, these functions were transferred to more than 900 local municipal authorities. Currently, the state registration services are also provided by 6,500 notaries and more than 100 certified municipal entities.Pavlo Moroz. Andriy Potiomkin. Consideration of claims on state registration matters. Part 2. As a result of this transfer, lines for obtaining registration services and preconditions for incentive fees disappeared. Local municipal authorities obtain registration fees. The Ministry of Justice was then left with a supervising function, implemented through the Committee on Consideration of Complaints in the field of state registration. For the time being, the Committee on Consideration of Complaints in state registration prevented more than 150 illegal corporate takeovers. =Registration of civil actions= The next important reform of the Ministry of Justice is decentralization of the system of registration of civil actions, initiated by Pavlo Moroz. The Ministry of Justice has launched this reform and organized the respective working group. The first result is implementation of the pilot project for citizens.

Recording and production Producer Sergio George was hired to produce more traditional tracks for the album. However, George wanted to try something different. According to George, he played a demo version of \\"La Negra Tiene Tumbao\\" for Cruz, \\"not knowing how she would respond, and that was the song that she most reacted to\\". It was the last song completed for the album. Musical composition \\"La Negra Tiene Tumbao\\" combines elements of salsa music, reggae music and hip hop music. The song's title translates to \\"The Black Woman has Style\\" or \\"The Black Woman has grace\\". The song was composed in minor key and incorporates the use of vocal call and response. Critical reception In Allmusic's Sharon Witmer review of the parent album, the song was selected as at the \\"CD's biggest draw\\".

The code word 'Big Ben' meant 'V2 Rocket' and was used by the Filter Room at Fighter Command and by the pilots of the mission; but the phrase 'Operation Big Ben' was not used in official documentation (none found since the release of former Top Secret papers from the National Archive from January 2004), even though pilots (such as Flt Lt Raymond Baxter, who went on to become the voice of the Farnborough Air Show and BBC TV's technology programme Tomorrow's World) identified the sorties under the name 'Operation Big Ben'.  Description  The missions were specific: Spitfire Mark XVI's with clipped wings, flew in formations of four aircraft (some Mark IX and some Mark XIV were also used occasionally) and dive-bombed the sites, sometimes through breaks in heavy cloud. Each Spitfire carried a 250lb bomb under each wing and a 500lb bomb under the fuselage. Very occasionally they would just carry the two 250lb bombs or just the 500lb bomb, if they were pin-pointing locations further away (this way they could save on fuel). Although the operation has been the subject of two extensive books, the extent of the success of the missions is still not known. It is considered successful because it is appreciated that the Spitfires did destroy some of the mobile V2 launch sites, along with bridges, roads and railway tracks, which were crucial supply lines; but the operation didn't completely stop the rocket attacks. In interview about 'Operation Big Ben', Flt Lt Raymond Baxter said that it was the most difficult operation he ever took part in during the Second World War and insisted that unequivocally, the operation was called 'Operation Big Ben'. Over the ten years since the operation has been appreciated by aviation historians, a short CGI film has documented the missions, a limited edition model of Raymond Baxter's Mark XVI Spitfire was produced (which he signed the plinth of each model) and two respected non- fiction books have become available.

It was built from 1900 to 1930s. It is also known as Daniel Carroll's House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000.  History  Daniel Carroll's House is a small timber residence constructed in 1900 on a selection owned by Daniel Carroll. Carroll was an early settler of the district, part of a wave of selectors who took up land in the area from the 1880s onwards, and his cottage was the nucleus of a small settlement that was to become the town of Kingaroy. Significant pastoral expansion took place in southern Queensland commencing in 1840 when extensive tracts of land were taken up on the Darling Downs, Brisbane Valley and Logan River area in 1840 and 1841. The first large properties of the Burnett district, Tarong and Nanango, were taken up in 1842. For about 40 years, these large pastoral holdings survived substantially intact and their dominance suppressed the need for service towns. However, the Lands Act of 1868 caused dramatic changes to rural areas and large portions of these leases were resumed for selection purposes. The result was the closer settlement of smaller selections, which consequently enabled the establishment of rural communities and created a need for service towns and public facilities. The first notable selection in the area was that of the Markwell brothers, who applied for of land in 1878. It was located on the Stuart River and Kingaroy Creek and became known as the Kingaroy Paddock, ultimately giving its name to the area. In 1891, Daniel Carroll selected portion 107V, a block abutting the Kingaroy Paddock. Carroll had arrived from Ireland at the age of twenty in 1887 and spent some years in the area working as a coach driver. In 1898, it was reported that Carroll was the only European living in the vicinity of the current site of Kingaroy and that he had built a hut for himself and a yard for his horses nearby. In 1900, in anticipation of his forthcoming marriage to Bridget Pender, Carroll had the present cottage built, by a Mr Ferdinand Seng. By this time, Carroll had selected further blocks of land adjoining portion 107V. To facilitate the transport of timber and other produce of developing agricultural industries in the district, the Kilkivan branch railway was extended to Wondai in 1903 and to the \\"56 mile peg\\" in 1904. The peg was near the corner of the Kingaroy Paddock. The termination of the railway line at the peg was the impetus for the establishment of the town of Kingaroy. Daniel Carroll and Arthur Youngman (owner of Taabinga station) sold town blocks at public auction in 1903-04. When the first train arrived on 19 December 1904, the Carroll Cottage was one of only three buildings at the termination site. The others being Carroll's new hotel, The Carrollee (burnt down in 1913) and F C Petersen's recently completed store. The official banquet for the opening of the railway was held in Carroll's horse paddock. After the extension of the railway, the establishment of commercial premises such as shops and hotels were soon followed by public offices, churches and schools. The seven years that the town served as railhead were sufficient to secure its growth beyond neighbouring centres and establish a lasting dominance. Daniel Carroll continued to be involved with the development of Kingaroy through his property interests and as a member of a variety of committees for public facilities. He donated a building site from his original block for St. Mary's, the first Catholic Church in Kingaroy and also donated land for the hospital. The Carroll family moved into a new home in Albert Street in 1910, but retained possession of the cottage, which was rented out. The property is still owned by members of the Carroll family, with the Kingaroy Historical Society as caretakers. It is furnished and interpreted to the early Interwar period and is open by appointment as a house museum.  Description  Daniel Carroll's House is located on a small block of land in Edward Street in the town of Kingaroy. The house is a four room cottage with several accretions. The cottage is a small, single storey timber dwelling, low-set on short timber stumps with a short, centrally located entry stair. The area of the house that accommodates the front two rooms has a steep hipped roof without eaves that is clad in corrugated iron and the back two rooms have a simple lean-to roof. A verandah runs across the front of the house with a recent cross braced balustrade replacing an earlier dowel balustrade. The cottage is clad externally in weatherboards and has ogee-profile steel window hoods surmounting the windows, which are double hung timber sashes. The detached kitchen is located at the back of the house, connected by a raised, covered walkway that has been enclosed in horizontal, corrugated iron sheeting. On the western side this area is abutted by a bathroom also sheeted in corrugated iron. The kitchen is a simple rectilinear building with a pitched roof. It is clad in weatherboards and has been extended with a small open, lean-to at the back which is used for timber storage. The cottage is lined internally with beaded, tongue and groove timber boarding and has three bedrooms and a parlour. The kitchen is lined with fibro cement sheeting.  Heritage listing  Carroll Cottage was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Daniel Carroll's House is important in demonstrating the evolution and pattern of Queensland's history, reflecting the housing and living conditions of early settlers in rural districts. As the earliest dwelling to be constructed in Kingaroy, Daniel Carroll's House demonstrates the growth of the town from a rural selection to a thriving town around a railhead and later a regional administrative and commercial centre. Constructed in 1900, the house is conspicuous amongst surrounding Interwar homes as being of an earlier period and contributes to an understanding of how the town developed. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Daniel Carroll's House demonstrates the principal characteristics of a small, timber residence constructed in a then remote rural district. Key features include the simple rectilinear form of the building, steep, hipped roof, basic four-roomed plan and detached kitchen. The house provides a good illustration of the way in which houses have traditionally been extended in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Daniel Carroll's House has aesthetic significance derived from its simple design, diminutive scale, cottage-like form and unrefined use of materials. It is largely intact and its current use as a house museum has the ability to evoke an impression of the lives of early residents and other times. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Daniel Carroll's House has strong social value to the Kingaroy community, both as the earliest house in the settlement on its original site and also as part of a community museum complex maintained by the local historical society. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The house has a special association with Daniel Carroll, a key figure in the establishment of Kingaroy.

She earned an A.B. in English from the University of Kansas in 1910 and completed a graduate degree at Bryn Mawr College in 1913. She was the daughter of William A. Calderhead, the congressional representative for Kansas' 5th District from 1895 to 1911.  Education and academic work  Calderhead attended the University of Kansas from 1906 to 1910, graduating with an A.B. in English. During her time at the university, she was a member of Pi Beta Phi, a fraternity dedicated to the educational advancement of women. In 1910, she published an article in the journal Modern Language Notes and began graduate studies at Bryn Mawr, having won a fellowship there. From 1910 to 1911, she was a Graduate Scholar in English, and from 1912 to 1913 was a resident fellow in English. She spent the summer of 1913 at the University of Chicago and returned to Marysville to teach English and Science. In 1916, her work on Middle English appeared in Modern Philology, publishing for the first time several fragments of early morality plays.  Activism  The Women's Voter Convention, San Francisco, 1915Calderhead became involved in the women's suffrage movement after meeting Doris Stevens and Lucy Burns, leaders of the Congressional Union, in New York City. Her first assignment in 1915 was to help organize the Union's exhibit at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition and the Women's Voter Convention. Calderhead was willing to travel extensively to advocate for suffrage. \\"I came a long way to work for the union because national suffrage seems to me the biggest political issue before the country,\\" she explained. \\"I think I ought to be able to convince others of this.\\" In 1916 Calderhead, in her role as secretary of the Congressional Union of Kansas, sent a letter to the House Committee on the Judiciary, informing them that on March 15, the fourth Kansas district Republican Convention had adopted a resolution favoring women's suffrage. In August that same year, the NWP dispatched teams to states that had already granted suffrage to mobilize support for a federal amendment for women's suffrage. Calderhead was sent to Arizona, which had granted women the right to vote in 1912, along with Vivian Pierce, Ella Thompson, Helen Todd, and Rose Winslow. The group met resistance from the Democratic Party, which opposed women's suffrage, and Calderhead reported that members of the party tried to ban the suffragists' meetings. She also traveled to Oklahoma to recruit supporters, telling a reporter for the Tulsa World that \\"We women of the [enfranchised] West must try to put ourselves in the places of the women of the great industrial centers of the East. These are the women for whom we are making this fight for freedom. It is literally that ‚Äì a fight for liberation.\\" In June 1917, Calderhead was arrested at the Smithsonian Institution, where she and fellow organizer Elizabeth Stuyvesant planned to display a banner during a visit by President Woodrow Wilson. On July 14, 1917, Calderhead was arrested again for picketing the White House and served three days in the Occoquan Workhouse. From January to June 1918, Calderhead conducted a speaking tour through Colorado, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Her activism did not stop once women gained suffrage in the United States. In 1932 she spoke before the House Foreign Affairs committee on the rights of women in the League of Nations.  Private life  Iris Calderhead was born January 3, 1889, in Marysville, Kansas, to Alice Gallant Calderhead and William Calderhead. Calderhead married John Brisben Walker (d. 1931) in 1918 and moved to Mt. Morrison, Colorado. In 1919, Walker and Calderhead founded a paper to promote \\"outspoken and fearless discussions of the great questions of the day.\\" During the Great Depression she was an official at the Consumers' Counsel Division of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and authored the 1936 report, Consumer Services of Government Agencies. In 1941, she married Wallace Pratt, and the two moved to Pratt's home in McKittrick Canyon in New Mexico. They moved to Arizona in 1960, so that Calderhead could receive treatment for arthritis.

UTR rates all players on a single 16-point scale, without regard to age, gender, nationality, or locale of a given match. All professional players in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women‚Äôs Tennis Association (WTA) have UTRs, as do most college players and many junior tournament players worldwide, as well as many adult league and tournament players. The UTR database includes results from more than 8 million matches and 200+ countries. More than 800,000 players have UTRs. Players, coaches, tournament directors, tennis clubs, tennis leagues, and national federations employ UTR in varied ways. These include selecting entrants for and seeding tournaments, recruiting players for college teams, scheduling competitive matches with other teams or individuals, finding appropriate local playing or training partners, choosing which tournaments to enter, and others. UTR is the official rating system of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA). In January 2018, the Tennis Channel announced its partnership with UTR, making the rating system part of the Tennis Channel's coverage of events.  Definition of Universal Tennis Rating  Universal Tennis Rating (UTR) is an index intended to be reliable and accurate that rates players' tennis skill. UTR rates all players‚Äîmen, women, and children‚Äîon a single 16-point scale (with two decimal places, e.g., 11.29) that works for players globally regardless of their skill level, from beginners to top professional competitors. UTR's algorithm calculates ratings from the last 30 eligible matches played within the preceding 12 months. The main data points are the percentage of games won (not simply the won/lost result), and the opponent‚Äôs rating. Each match played generates a rating; a player‚Äôs UTR is a weighted average of all eligible matches. Ratings versus Rankings Although tennis is a global sport, it does not have a common international rating system. Tennis has nothing comparable to the handicap system(though in France les classements par handicaps et les classements par rangs has a handicap built into their ratings) in golf for example, which enables all golfers to record their scores on specific courses, generating a handicap that is valid on any golf course in the world. In tennis, the vast majority of competitive players enter events only in their geographical locale. Whatever ranking they earn has meaning only within that region or country. Worldwide, hundreds of national federations govern tennis, and multiple ranking systems frequently exist within a single nation. There may be as many as 2,700 different tennis ranking and rating systems around the world. Furthermore, nearly all of these are ranking systems, not rating systems. Rankings sort players into a \\"pecking order,\\" assigning each athlete a spot relative to all others ranked in that system. Rankings are ordinal numbers that reflect only the athletes' relative positions, not their playing skill as measured by a standard yardstick. UTR, in contrast, rates each athlete on a single, standard metric. Therefore, tennis players' UTRs are largely independent of each other, aside from the algorithm's weighting of the strength of opponents who compete directly with the rated player. Nearly all tennis ranking systems use a \\"points per round\\" (PPR) method that assigns points depending on what round a player reaches in a given tournament, along with the rated \\"strength\\" of that tournament in terms of the players it accepts into the draw. This is administratively easy, but it does not consider the skill level of the individual opponents a player faced in the event. Paradoxically, the PPR method can create an incentive to seek out weaker tournaments, in which it will be easier to survive into later rounds. The plethora of ranking systems and the lack of a shared metric has created a ‚ÄúTower of Babel‚Äù in international tennis. National federations, tournaments, coaches, teams, colleges, and individual players speak different languages that do not readily translate into one another. Consequently, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and many of tennis's national governing bodies, including the United States Tennis Association (USTA), have become interested in developing a standard rating method, a kind of \\"metric system\\" for tennis that, like a golf handicap, could function globally. ‚ÄúThe UTR system is great for tennis in so many ways,‚Äù said former ATP Player Council president Eric Butorac, in a 2015 Sports Illustrated story on UTR. ‚ÄúAt a UTR event, you are guaranteed to play against players who are close to your ability level. I have played a lot in France, where they have a similar system, and it works so efficiently. I hope the whole world gets on board with UTR, as it could drastically change worldwide tennis for the better.‚Äù History of Universal Tennis Rating Virginia tennis professional Dave Howell launched UTR in 2008 as a private company to promote the rating system he developed and tested successfully in southeastern Virginia. Alex Cancado, a tennis player and web designer in the area, developed an algorithm to operationalize Howell‚Äôs rating system. Howell brought in some early followers as partners and began to concentrate full-time on developing the UTR. In his coaching career, Howell had mentored junior players from the United States who entered French tournaments. Juniors in the U.S. compete under various ranking systems, including a widely used PPR system administered by the USTA. In contrast, France employs a national rating system based on head-to-head won/lost results. This enables French tournament directors to facilitate \\"level-based play\\" ‚Äî orchestrating matches between players of comparable skill, often without regard to their age or gender. French tournaments often use staggered-entry draws that allow stronger players to enter a tournament in later rounds. This design enables a single event to embrace a wide range of skill levels, from club players up to touring professionals, but the French classification system ensures a high probability of even matches for entrants at all levels. Howell found that the French national rating system yielded events that were, overall, far more competitive than junior events in the U.S. To study why this was so, he defined a \\"competitive\\" match as one in which the losing player wins more than half the minimum number of games needed to win the match. In the common \\"best 2-of-3 set\\" format, that equals seven games, as the winner must take at least 12 games to capture the match. Hence, a result of 6-3, 6-4 or closer reaches the \\"competitive threshold,\\" as defined by UTR. After statistically analyzing thousands of USTA boys' and girls' junior tournament matches at all levels, Howell found that on average, only about one match in four (27 percent) was competitive; USTA national junior events reached the 40 percent level. Howell modeled UTR on the French system, developing, with his colleagues, an algorithm that calculated ratings from head-to-head results with specific opponents, taking their rated skill into account. He and his colleagues also made UTR more precise than the French system by entering the number of games won in a match, not only the won/lost result. The use of Howell's rating system in Virginia produced junior tournaments with substantially more competitive matches‚Äîa rate that equalled the 50-60 percent level typically seen at the top tiers of college and professional tennis. The Founders of the Universal Tennis Rating are: Dave Howell, Darryl Cummings, Alexandre Cancado, Steve Clark, Niclas Kohler, Johan Varverud, Raquel Araujo Kohler, and Patricia Araujo Cancado. = Adoption and Usage of UTR = UTR gradually spread from Virginia to other tennis venues in the United States, particularly in junior events which, as noted, often include many non-competitive matches. The system also gained traction in college tennis, which in recent decades has evolved into a truly global sport that embraces young athletes from all tennis-playing nations. But the prevalence of so many ranking and rating systems in international tennis confronted college coaches in the United States with serious problems evaluating the caliber of international recruits. By offering a standard, reliable index of skill applicable worldwide, UTR answered this quandary. Consequently, in recent years UTR has become a \\"gold standard\\" for assessing collegiate tennis recruits, both internationally and domestically. UTR also helps recruits match themselves with appropriate college programs. A leading proponent of UTR, Dave Fish, head men‚Äôs tennis coach at Harvard University, states that ‚ÄúThe Universal Tennis Rating system is now being recognized by many college coaches as the best metric available for judging junior talent. While the recruiting benefits of UTR are evident for both coaches and recruits, the widespread use of the Universal Tennis approach to tournament play promises to transform the entire player development system of tennis in America.‚Äù Since 2011, the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA), the governing body for college tennis in the U.S., has worked closely with Universal Tennis and now relies on UTR data to determine event seeding at U.S. college invitationals; seeding and selection for its 51 ITA/Oracle Summer Circuit tournaments; and seeding and selection in the Oracle ITA Junior Masters events. In 2016, the ITA made UTR its official rating system for college tennis in the United States. UTR also extended into the professional game, where all ATP and WTA players now have UTRs. National federations have recognized the value of UTR for attracting players to tennis and for developing their skill through competitive matches. Currently more than 40 national tennis federations have committed to submitting tournament results to UTR. These include the Lawn Tennis Association of Great Britain, Tennis Canada, Tennis Australia, the Brazilian Tennis Confederation, and the Bulgarian Tennis Federation. In January 2018, the Tennis Channel announced its partnership with UTR, making the rating system part of the Tennis Channel's coverage of competition. At the same time, a new ownership group assumed control of UTR, which is based in San Francisco, California. Universal Tennis‚Äôs chairman and CEO is Mark Leschly, founder and managing partner of Iconica Partners, a global investment firm specializing in the intersection of technology, sports, and media, which heads the new ownership. The group's partners include Mark Hurd, CEO of Oracle Corporation; Ken Hao, managing partner of Silver Lake Partners; Jan Leschly, former CEO of SmithKline Beecham, a former top-ten ATP player and former chairman of the International Tennis Hall of Fame; Ken Solomon, president of the Tennis Channel; the Tennis Media Company; Major League Baseball; and the Los Angeles Dodgers' ownership group. Concept of Universal Tennis Rating Recreational tennis‚Äîfriends hitting with each other or playing games‚Äîaccounts for the majority of tennis. But at the competitive level, junior play in the United States and elsewhere sorts players into age groups. Typically, this means separate tournaments for players aged 12-and-under, 14-and-under, 16-and-under, and 18-and-under. Tournaments also separate boys and girls into separate draws. Adult events normally sort entrants by half-decades, using minimum instead of maximum ages (35-and-over, 40-and-over, etc.) Separating players into groups by age and gender does organize draws simply, but it also throws together competitors in ways that are unrelated to their tennis skill. Entry to, and seedings in, tournaments typically derive from players‚Äô rankings. These in turn depend on PPR amassed in previous tournaments, regardless of opponents' strengths or actual match scores. The resulting draws often pit top players against much lower-ranked athletes, especially in early rounds, frequently leading to one- sided matches. In contrast, designing draws or flights with UTR consistently produces many more matches between athletes of roughly equal ability. Two players whose UTRs fall within 1.0 of each other will have a competitive match two to three times as often as those with ratings more than 1.0 apart. Furthermore, research has shown that when players' UTRs differ by more than 1.0 point, the lower-rated athlete will upset his or her higher-rated opponent only 3 percent of the time. Close, competitive contests are widely recognized by coaches as the most powerful engine for developing tennis skill. Even matches benefit both players. Non-competitive, one-sided matches, in contrast, typically discourage the loser and fail to challenge the winner, offering neither one much opportunity to improve his or her skills.  The Universal Tennis Rating Scale  Universal Tennis Ratings are expressed as a number with up to two decimal points falling between 1.0 and 16.50, e.g., 9.46. UTR's 16-point scale embraces everyone from beginners through intermediate recreational and competitive players, to active tournament and college varsity athletes, and ranging up to the highest levels of the game at the top professional ranks. For example, as of January 2018, Rafael Nadal of Spain held a UTR of 16.27 and Switzerland's Roger Federer was at 16.21. Simona Halep of Romania was rated at 13.26 and Serena Williams of the United States at 13.20. Turning to college players, NCAA Division I men generally fall between 12.0 and 15.0. NCAA Division I women typically hold UTRs between 9.0 and 12.0. The vast majority of UTRs derive from sanctioned tournament results. Universal Tennis regularly records results from all ATP, WTA, and ITF Junior and Futures events; all sanctioned USTA junior events, and all ITA (Intercollegiate Tennis Association) and NCAA dual matches and tournaments. UTR also incorporates results from a growing number of national federations. It updates and maintains ratings for more than 800,000 current competitors, and its database includes 8 million match results. To ensure verification, UTR only accepts match results that have been published on the internet. Each rated player has a profile on the UTR website, with a singles and doubles rating based on up to 30 of the most recent matches played in a 12-month period. These profiles display the match scores along with competitors‚Äô names and ratings. Profiles also include hometowns and, when applicable, the player's college or school team. College teams, and a growing number of high-school teams, have profile pages of their own, listing their varsity athletes and associated rating data. In addition to including the percentage of matches that reached the competitive threshold, profiles indicate the reliability of the displayed ratings. When a new player first appears in published and/or sanctioned tournament results, that player‚Äôs rating will have a low reliability percentage. Once the athlete has played five or more matches against opponents with 100-percent reliable ratings, his/her own rating will be certified as 100 percent reliable.

The 30 cm Bubble Chamber, prototyped as a 10 cm Bubble Chamber, was a particle detector used to study high-energy physics at CERN. Bubble chambers are similar to cloud chambers, both in application and in basic principle. A chamber is normally made by filling a large cylinder with a liquid heated to just below its boiling point. As particles enter the chamber, a piston suddenly decreases its pressure, and the liquid enters into a superheated, metastable phase. Charged particles create an ionization track, around which the liquid vaporizes, forming microscopic bubbles. Bubble density around a track is proportional to a particle's energy loss. Bubbles grow in size as the chamber expands, until they are large enough to be seen or photographed. Several cameras are mounted around it, allowing a three-dimensional image of an event to be captured. Following the discovery of strange particles in cosmic-ray showers and the evidence of a large spectrum of heavy mesons, Charles Peyrou started the construction of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber. A prototype, the 10 cm Bubble Chamber, was first built in 1957 and it was seen as a learning process, allowing the team to test and study the functionality of bubble chambers. Furthermore, the chamber was easily modifiable and had no magnetic field. The experience acquired during the prototype phase enabled the team to build the 30 cm bubble chamber. The chamber was cylindrical with a total volume of 12.5 litres, it had a piston to control the expansion and coil generating a 1.5 T magnetic field. As the prototype, the 30 cm bubble chamber enabled systematic measurements of distortion and ionisation of the tracks, studies on the stopping power of liquid hydrogen and on the size and growth of the bubbles in the chamber. In particular, it was very useful for experiments at medium and low energy in a purified beam. In 1959, it was placed at the Synchro-Cyclotron (SC) where it was first exposed to beams of œÄ+ mesons of 265 and 330 MeV. Later, the chamber received a 16 GeV/c œÄ‚àí beam from the Proton Synchrotron (PS) enabling the study of pion production in œÄ‚àí-proton interactions as well as the production of strange particles. Experiments to investigate the interaction between two protons, at 24 GeV/c, were also conducted. To analyse these complex interactions, Charles Peyrou developed new methods such as the ‚ÄúPeyrou plot‚Äù and the ‚Äúprincipal axis‚Äù. The photographs obtained proved the exceptional quality of the 30 cm bubble chamber despite its small dimensions. The chamber ceased operations in 1962 having produced 150 km of film during its three years of operation. In 1965, the 30 cm Bubble Chamber was lent to the National Laboratory at Frascati.

It was in the early 1990s, when he lived in Havana, that Greek-Lebanese music novelty-wiz and avant-garde producer, composer and arranger Michel Elefteriades came up with the groundbreaking music concept that led, a few years later in 1999, to the formation of Hanine Y Son Cubano, the now seminal Arabo-Cuban music genre. It was while he was sitting in a cafe in Havana, surrounded by Afro-Cuban sounds, that Elefteriades began singing a classic of the Arabic music, \\"Ya Habibi ta ala\\" of the Arab diva Asmahan . The idea of a fusion of Cuban and Arabic music genres came instantly to his mind. Michel Elefteriades spent two years trying to achieve this project. He selected seven of the best Cuban musicians, he chose the legendary vocalist Marcelino Linares, who died in 2000, two days before launching the concept. He auditioned hundreds of singers before choosing Hanine Abu Chakra, young singer from Lebanon who was comfortable singing classic Arabic music and had just finished her last year at the Conservatoire. The project experienced a dazzling success. The Arabo-Cuban music was born. The band‚Äôs fulgurating success story gave birth to a few best- selling albums, namely \\"Arabo-Cuban\\" distributed worldwide by international production company ‚ÄúWarner‚Äù, \\"10908 km\\", which have become referential in the realm of World Music and \\"The Festivals Album: Baalbeck & Beiteddine\\".

She is an associate professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia and resides in Winnipeg. Kirkness has received numerous awards for her outstanding contributions spanning five decades including the Order of Canada in 1998. Kirkness had an important impact on Canadian indigenous education policy and practice. She is the author of \\"numerous books and articles on the history of Indigenous education.\\" The University of Manitoba's Verna J. Kirkness Science and Engineering Education Program was established in 2009 and in November 2013 a native studies colloquium honoured her as a national leader in education. Early years Kirkness attended a private high school in the 1950s 160 kilometres away from Fisher River with her tuition paid by the Women's Missionary Society of Canada. Education Kirkness graduated from the Manitoba Normal School with a Teaching Certificate in 1959. She completed her B.A (1974), B.Ed. (1976) and Master of Education (1980) at the University of Manitoba. Career With her teaching certificate in 1959, Kirkness began to teach in a residential school. She taught elementary school in the Manitoba public school system then worked as principal in First Nations schools. While acting as the \\"first cross-cultural consultant for the Manitoba Department of Education Curriculum Branch\\" and Elementary School Supervisor with Frontier School Division from 1967 to 1970, Kirkness launched a language immersion program in Cree and Ojibwa in several Manitoba schools. Manitoba Indian Brotherhood In the early 1970s she was the first education director for the Manitoba Indian Brotherhood‚Äînow known as the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs‚Äîand then the National Indian Brotherhood where she played a pivotal role in the publication of the two quintessential policy documents, \\"Wahbung: Our Tomorrows\\" (1971) and \\"Indian Control of Indian Education\\" (1972). \\"These two major works have shaped First Nations education in Canada for more than 40 years.\\" =Wahbung: Our Tomorrows= Kirkness participated in the development and implementation of the Manitoba Indian Brotherhood (MIB)'s 1971 position paper entitled \\"Wahbung: Our Tomorrows\\"‚Äîwritten in opposition to then-Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's 1969 White Paper which proposed the abolition of the Indian Act. The federal government at the time argued that the Indian Act was discriminatory and that the special legal relationship between Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian state should be dismantled in favour of equality, in accordance with Trudeau's vision of a \\"just society.\\" The federal government proposed that by eliminating \\"Indian\\" as a distinct legal status, the resulting equality among all Canadians would help resolve the problems faced by Aboriginal peoples. After opposition from many Aboriginal leaders‚Äîincluding the MIB‚Äîthe white paper was abandoned in 1970. National Indian Brotherhood Kirkness also participated in the development of the landmark 1972 national policy‚Äîthe first written policy on Indian education‚Äîentitled \\"Indian Control of Indian Education\\"‚Äîwhich the Chiefs of the National Indian Brotherhood adopted and then presented to then-Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development‚ÄîJean Chr√©tien‚Äîon December 21, 1972.

Sharma aspired to become a cricketer but was unable to take up the sport due to lack of adequate facilities in Morena. When he was eight, Sharma started practicing javelin throw. His instructors suggested him to switch to long jump after watching him \\"jump up with joy\\" at each successful throw. He took part in long jump events which were a part of Raksha Bandhan celebrations in Morena, and, at his parents' suggestion, decided to pursue a career in long jump. Apart from cricket and javelin throw, he also played volleyball, triple jump, discus throw and hurdles during his childhood.

The area covers of mainly agricultural and formerly agricultural lands, as well as associated woodlots, and includes nine historically significant farm complexes. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The Jericho Street area is a rural upland, roughly bounded on the south by the White River and the east by the flood plains of the Connecticut River. To the west it is roughly bounded by Jericho Brook, and the north by the east-west town line between Norwich and Hartford, except for one associated farm complex just over the line on Joshua Street. The area is served by roads whose routes were laid out in the late 19th century, when the area was first settled. Jericho Street runs north-south through the district, turning eastward near the northern end, with Wallace and Sugartop Roads running westward, and Jericho Road eastward. All but two of the historic farm complexes are found along Jericho Street; in addition to the one on Joshua, another is located on the west side of Sugartop, just south of the Norwich line. The distribution of wooded and open areas is relatively unchanged since about 1940. with The town of Hartford was first settled in the 1760s, with its early settlements along the Connecticut River. The Jericho Hill area was settled beginning in 1781, and the last of its historic farmsteads was built in 1841. All of the early farmsteads were simple Cape style houses, and were soon accompanied by agricultural outbuildings. The Jericho Hill area contains a remarkable set of contiguous historic farm properties, in which a relatively large number of outbuildings have survived, although not always in the best of condition. The district also includes a district schoolhouse, built in 1849, which still stands near the junction of Jericho Street and Jericho Road, and functions now as a local community center.

Working primarily in pencil, Alejandre creates intricately cross-hatched drawings that can take months to complete. Alejandre's series of twelve panels, \\"Panoramas,\\" is featured at the Los Angeles Metro Rancho Park/Westwood station. Alejandre also creates woodblock prints using both a giant press he built himself and by hand printing. His monumental My Fathers, which is in the permanent collection at the National Museum of Mexican Art, in Chicago, IL, was created by the latter method. Early life and education Abel Alejandre was born in Apatzing√°n, Michoac√°n, Mexico. As a young child he worked in the cotton fields to earn money for his family. In 1975, when he was 7, the family immigrated to the United States via Tijuana where he encountered running water, electricity, and television for the first time. Alejandre grew up in the Long Beach area of Southern California and attended Long Beach City College, graduating with an Associate of Arts degree. Work After painting in color for 25 years, Alejandre began working in black and white, becoming completely focused on creating monochromatic works. His trademark crosshatching is created by gessoing and sanding the surface of the canvas or panels and then beginning work with pencil. A single piece of art can take over 5 months to complete, with the artist working 10 to 12 hours a day, and can use over 700 pencils. In 2013, Alejandre was announced as one of eight grantee artists whose art would be installed at one of the Los Angeles Metro stations along the new Expo line that runs from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica beach. His twelve panels, ‚ÄúPanoramas,‚Äù are displayed at the Rancho Park/Westwood station. Panels ‚Äúdepict the legs of travelers headed to their destinations: a business professional with her rolling briefcase, a parent with a stroller, and a hummingbird in flight,‚Äù creating ‚Äústory of place through the act of commuting.‚Äù His gallery work focuses around issues of machismo and masculinity and he uses art ‚Äúas a means to acknowledge and process what he confesses to be ‚Äòpast insecurities, insults, and painful memories.‚Äô‚Äù Alejandre created murals for the 1984 Olympic Games and in 2005 curated and staged an exhibition of Mexican and American artists on the border fence in Mexicali/Calexico border. In 2011, he worked with the gallery, Avenue 50 Studio, a recipient of Southern California Council for the Humanities grant on \\"Resurrected Histories: Voices from the Chicano Arts Collectives of Highland Park.\\" His art is featured in the book Drawing from the Inside Out: Projects for Beginning through Advanced Drawing, and he is featured in two films by Eric Minh Swenson. Alejandre's artworks have been exhibited at venues that include Coagula Curatorial Gallery, Center for the Arts Eagle Rock, Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, Tropico de Nopal and the Mexican Cultural Institute.

She was one of the richest merchants in the latter half of the 18th century in Turku, Finland. Life Anna Elisabeth Baer was the daughter of the rich merchant and city councillor Kristoffer Carlbohm and Anna Warg of Gamla Karleby. In 1743, she married the wealthy merchant Anders Baer (1712‚Äì1770) of Turku, who was also an elected representative to the Swedish parliament. The couple had thirteen children, seven of whom became adults. =Business career= She took over the family business (as well as her husband's guild membership) after his death in 1770, and managed it for nearly thirty years after his death. She sent several petitions relating to business to the Swedish Collegium of Commerce. She was a shipowner, owned a merchant company and several properties outside of Turku, as well as parts of a brick factory, a saw mill and a tobacco factory. From 1770 until 1777, she managed the Turku city hall restaurant in companionship with Elisabeth Wittfooth. After the death of her spouse, she was sued by the tobacco trader Emanuel Tillman for the debt of her late husband, for the unpaid tobacco leaves he had ordered for a tobacco factory in Turku in which he owned an interest. Baer refused to pay the entire amount but claimed that the other part owners of the factory should pay part of the debt. This was contested by the biggest part owner, Jost Joachim Pipping, who demanded to see the Baer account books to verify the purchase had been exclusively that of Anders Baer. The legal dispute lasted for three years, until 1774, when the court decided that all part owners should pay a share of the debt. During the Theatre War in 1790, the war lugger Tumlaren was gifted to the royal fleet of king Gustav III of Sweden by a group of female merchants (referred to as 'Merchant Widows') of the city of Turku, among them being Anna Elisabeth Baer and Elisabeth Wittfooth.Bladh, Christine, Hennes snilles styrka: kvinnliga grosshandlare i Stockholm och √Öbo 1750‚Äì1820, S√∂dert√∂rns h√∂gskola, Huddinge, 2018 http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:sh:diva-34733 Anna Elisabeth Baer died a very rich woman in 1799, and left her possessions to her three surviving children. =The 1771 Election= Anna Elisabeth Baer wanted to vote in the Riksdag elections in Turku in 1771, and sent a letter to the governor regarding the matter. The petition was sent together with the book binder Hedvig S√∂derman and the tanner Hedvig Ottiliana Richter, both widows who had inherited their businesses from their late husbands, and who all petitioned to vote on the grounds that they were tax paying guild members. The petition to vote was sent because the election of the burgher city representatives to the Riksdag had already been held, without her having been called to participate in it, despite having the legal right to do so. In the election, Jost Joachim Pipping was elected representative to the Riksdag by the Turku burghers. Pipping was a business rival of Baer, with whom she was involved in a court dispute at the time. The burgher election of Turku was contested by both the Craftsmen's Guild as well as by Baer. In her protest, she demanded the right to exercise her vote and made the case that because she paid taxes as a burgher, she should have the right to elect her burgher representative, and that if her right to vote was not respected, she feared that her other rights as a businessperson were in danger of eventually being contested in the same way. In her protest, she wrote to the Governor: :\\"I make these demands for no other reasons or designs than to defend my rights and priviliges, without which my Profession and Business Trade could be limited and mistreated, a concern to which I trust upon the consideration of Your Grace.\\" In Sweden- Finland at the time, there was in fact conditional women's suffrage, and women who were tax paying guild members did have the legal right to vote, a fact that Baer may have been avare of. In Sweden, women did vote in the 1771 election if they were taxpaying guild members of legal majority, which Baer herself became when she was widowed: and Finland was at that time a part of Sweden, thus this conditional women's suffrage should have applied in Finland as well. However, this right was contested in Finland, where it was not considered proper for women to appear in the town halls to discuss political issues. The answer to the petition of 1771 was a refusal from the governor, after having consulted the burgher elders of the city of Turku, regarding their view on the matter. The burgher elders stated that Baer, S√∂derman and Richter had merely inherited their businesses (and burgher rights) from their late husbands: they had not sworn the burgher oath personally, were thus not 'full members' of the guilds, and thereby they did not have the right to vote, despite being guild members.Jarna Heinonen, Kirsi Vainio-Korhonen, Women in Business Families: From Past to Present In his answer to Baer's petition to vote, the governor stated that she had no reason to fear that her business rights should be threatened in any way, but: :\\"‚Ä¶ Mrs Baer wishes to vote for the representatives of the Parliament: this curious matter seemed too ridiculous for the City Elders to answer further. For that reason, and because it seemed likely that Mrs Baer had been seduced to this step, so unexpected for the strength of her intellect and unflattering for her sex, we will give no further reply to her petition in this matter.\\" The conditional women's suffrage in Sweden-Finland was in any case abolished the following year, when the revolution of 1772 abolished the age of liberty in favour of absolute monarchy. Nevertheless, the Turku burgher election of 1771 was deemed to be incorrect and a re-election was held, during which Pipping lost his place.

Following his business career, he has with his wife, Myriam Ullens, established the Guy & Myriam Ullens Foundation, known for the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China, and for founding the Ullens School in Lalitpur, Nepal.  Early life  Guy Ullens was born in San Francisco, California, as the third child to Baron Jean Marie Joseph Anne Mathilde Alphonse Ullens de Schooten Whettnall (1897‚Äì1950), a Belgian diplomat, and a member of the noble family of the Southern Netherlands. His mother was ethnographic photographer, writer, and Royal Geographical Society fellow, Baroness Marie Th√©r√®se Pauline Francis Ullens de Schooten Whettnall n√©e Wittouck (1905‚Äì89), of the Belgium noble family , a daughter of distilling and sugar magnate , who together with his brothers and Paul Wittouck owned the Sugar refinery of Tienen. The family moved to Oslo, Norway shortly after Guy was born, where Jean Ullens took up the diplomatic position of acting Minister for Belgium. Over the course of World War II, the family was confined to Berlin, and later lived in India, Pakistan, and Iran.  Education and career  After a degree in law from the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium, in 1958, Ullens obtained an MBA at Stanford University in 1960. He started Eurocan in Mechelen, Belgium, a company that specialized in the manufacture of metal packagings for preserved foods and beverages. In 1973, he joined the management of the family company R. T. Holding, a conglomerate in food industries, and played as CEO a central role in the company's expansion into Asia. In 1989, the Raffinerie Tirlemontoise was sold to German company S√ºdzucker in a ‚Ç¨1 billion deal. Proceeds from the sale were reinvested in food businesses via the holding company Artal Group, which Ullens served as president and CEO for. In 1999, following a change in strategy, Artal entered the textile industry buying French company Albert,http://supplychainmagazine.fr/TOUTE-INFO/Archives/SCM096/RETOUR- EXPERIENCE-96-CWF.pdf and took control of Weight Watchers International in a US$735 million 1980s-style leveraged buyout in September 1999 buying from Heinz 94% of Weight Watchers' equity. Artal Group subsequently earned US$3.8 billion by selling stocks while retaining a 52% majority stake in Weight Watchers. Guy Ullens told Forbes in 2012, that the initial US$224 million direct investment in Weight Watchers had returned US$5.2 billion to Artal Group.  Philanthropic projects  In 2000, Guy Ullens retired from business to devote himself to philanthropic projects with his wife, Myriam Ullens. In 2002 they set up the Guy & Myriam Ullens Foundation. One of the first purposes of the Foundation was to sponsor and organize exhibitions of Chinese art, and to lend pieces to museums and cultural centres around the world. Guy and Myriam Ullens helped children in Nepal by establishing orphanages and two intensive care centres for children with malnutrition. They also set up the Ullens School Kathmandu, partnering with the Bank Street College of Education to train Nepalese teachers. The Ullens School Kathmandu is the only school in Nepal to be IB certified. When Myriam Ullens was diagnosed with cancer in 2003, Guy Ullens took over the development of the Nepal project.  Art collection  In the early 1980s, Ullens initiated a collection of Chinese art that is one of the world's largest and by 2007 included nearly 1,700 pieces. The Ullens Collection is managed by the Guy and Myriam Ullens Foundation. In 2007, the Foundation established the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art (UCCA) in the Dashanzi district of Beijing. In order to establish UCCA, Ullens sold off his collection of J. M. W. Turner watercolour paintings for ¬£10.76 million at a Sotheby's auction in London in July 2007. UCCA was the first not-for- profit art centre in China dedicated to contemporary art.

The journal is considered to be an important document of the nationalist or Slavophile strand within the Soviet dissident movement.  Biography  Vladimir Osipov was born on 9 August 1938 in Slantsy, Leningrad Oblast. He entered studies at the History faculty of Moscow State University. He was expelled in 1959 for protesting the arrest of Anatoly Ivanov, a fellow student, but was able to finish his studies at the Moscow Pedagogical Institute in 1960. As a student, Osipov was involved in reviving the informal Mayakovsky Square poetry readings in 1960. During this time, he produced a samizdat (self-published) literary journal Boomerang. In 1961, Osipov was sentenced to seven years in strict- regime labour camps for \\"Anti-Soviet propaganda\\". In the camps, he converted to Christianity. He was released in 1968 and managed to find work as a fireman. During the years 1971-1973, Osipov produced nine issues of the samizdat journal Veche (Assembly). The journal was to be a \\"Russian patriotic journal\\" that followed the tradition of Fyodor Dostoyevsky and the Slavophiles, taking what Osipov called a \\"Russophile\\" position. Osipov also edited the samizdat journal Zemlia (Earth) in 1974, with a more religious orientation. Zemlia carried material by Russian Orthodox dissenters such as Anatoly Levitin-Krasnov. In 1974, Osipov was arrested, tried, and sentenced to a second term for engaging in \\"anti-Soviet propaganda\\". Osipov took part in the defence of the parliament during the attempted hard-line coup against Gorbachev in August 1991. During the 1990s and early 2000s, Osipov was active as one of the leaders of the Union \\"Christian Rebirth\\" (UCR), which calls for the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. His third wife was writer Adel Naidenovich, who also participated in the samizdat journal Veche. Osipov died on 20 October 2020 in Moscow. References  External links  * –ë–£–ú–ï–†–ê–ù–ì [Boomerang.

The company specializes not only in contemporary urban fiction - both in Malay and English - but also Malay translations of foreign titles, and graphic novels. Some of these novels have also been adapted into film, bringing the publisher's name further into the Malaysian mainstream. The publisher did its selling operations entirely online when it first started, until in 11 April 2015 when its own flagship bookstore (known as Kedai FIXI) was launched in Jaya Shopping Centre in Petaling Jaya.  History  Amir - who has directed a number of film titles that were deemed too controversial to be screened in Malaysia - had been inspired to establish the company after attending a local book awards ceremony. There, he had discovered that almost all of the Malay language fiction nominees were entirely in the romance genre. Thus, the creation of the label is considered to be his reaction from a need to further diversify the range of popular Malay literature that was produced at that time. He decided on the name \\"FIXI\\" for the label, which derives from the Dutch-derived Indonesian word fiksi or 'fiction'. According to him, the naming of the company was his tongue-in-cheek statement hinting that \\"nothing is original in the world of novels\\". Imprints =FIXI Novo= This imprint showcases Malaysian English-language fiction produced in-house by the company. This includes the acclaimed KL Noir series. =FIXI Verso= The imprint for Malay translations of renowned foreign language fiction. Some of those translated works include those written by Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, John Green, and Haruki Murakami. =GRAFIXI= Grafixi is the imprint for the company's catalogue of graphic novels. The publisher had secured rights to translate the back catalogue of DC Comics into Malay under this label in April 2016. This had led to the release of two translated Superman/Batman titles from the reputable American comic book publisher: Public Enemies and Supergirl. On 4 August of the same year, Grafixi had released the official cover art of Suicide Squad: Kicked in the Teeth as a teaser for the upcoming translation of the comic. It was later announced that the title would be available for sale on the following week.

Early life and education Donald Arthur Jelinek was born in the Bronx on February 17, 1934. His parents were immigrants to the United States. His father had a print shop and his mother worked as a secretary. He attended the Bronx High School of Science, and took his higher education degrees from New York University and New York University Law School. SNCC Jelinek left his job at a Wall Street law firm in 1965 and did pro bono work for the American Civil Liberties Union, defending members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). He stayed on after the summer, and in 1966 was arrested for practicing law in Alabama without a license. He was director of the Southern Rural Research Project. In that role in 1968 he filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Agriculture representing poor African Americans in Alabama. The suit demanded distribution of food stamps and surplus food in counties that were denying these services to the poor. The suit arose about of the work of the Southern Rural Research Project, which documented the extent of malnutrition in rural areas. He stayed in the South for three years before moving to California. He remained connected to the civil rights movement and was a member of Bay Area Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement.  Alcatraz and Attica  After moving to California, he represented the group of Native Americans who seized Alcatraz Island in the 1969 Occupation of Alcatraz. The Native Americans had claimed title to the island which belonged to the Federal government but was no longer being used. They claimed the island based on the terms of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. That treaty stated that unused federal land should be returned to its former native owners. Beginning 1971, Jelinek coordinated the defense of the inmates charged after the Attica prison riot in New York. Litigation continued for decades, with inmates being eventually cleared of penalties. Later career Jelinek also represented conscientious objectors during the Vietnam War. He served three terms on the Berkeley City Council from 1984 to 1990. He ran for Mayor of Berkeley in 1994 and 1998 but lost both times. Working locally, he defended flea market vendors who were being evicted from the BART system parking lot, which they had originally used with the consent of the transport agency.

Star Sconce) is a quarter in the center of Hamburg (Germany) within the Altona borough. In 2014, the population was 7,776 on an area of 0.6 sq km with a density of 14,113 inhabitants per sq km.Ein kunterbuntes Viertel mit eigensinnigen Bewohnern, Hamburg.de, in German After Reeperbahn, it's Hamburg's best known entertainment and nightlife district. It is also known as Schanzenviertel () and nicknamed Schanze (). History The name of the quarter originates from a sconce (German: Schanze) formed like a star which has been built in the area in 1682 in front of the Hamburg Wallring. From the 1930s to the 1970s the quarter was home for a large number of working-class people. Since the 1970s, families and students have started to move into the area. It is nearly, but not fully, congruent with the entertainment district of Schanzenviertel with its many bars and clubs, which is dubbed \\"Schanze\\" by its inhabitants. In the local slang, residents here live \\"in the sconce\\" (\\"in der Schanze\\"). The former concert house/theater building Rote Flora (built in 1888 as Flora concert hall) is also located here, at the street of Schulterblatt. It was squatted by leftist groups in 1989, after there were plans since 1987/88 to rebuild it as a new musical theater. These plans were later realized near Holstenstra√üe station as Neue Flora. Since the beginning of the occupation, Rote Flora was used for cultural events by the squatting groups. In 2000, the building was acquired by real-estate agent Klausmartin Kretschmer, under a contract where the city of Hamburg prohibited him to make any alterations. Because he planned to make alterations anyway, conflicts arose with residents. In 2014, Hamburg city re-bought the building to avoid further conflicts; the building was renovated in 2015 by volunteers. Since the beginning of the new millennium, Sternschanze is en vogue and subject to gentrification. Nevertheless, political demonstrations, mostly by leftist groups, take place here and sometimes lead to clashes with the police, frequently on 1 May (German Labour Day). Graffiti paintings can be found on many walls throughout the quarter. In 2008, the area of Schanzenviertel, which formerly was cut into three parts by the boundaries of Hamburg-Mitte, Eimsb√ºttel, and Altona, was merged into the new quarter of Sternschanze, which since then has belonged only to the Altona borough. Geography Sternschanze is located between the quarters of St. Pauli, Altona-Altstadt, Eimsb√ºttel, and Rotherbaum. Transportation Sternschanze station is serviced by Hamburg S-Bahn (lines S11, S21, S31) and U-Bahn trains (U3 line), Feldstra√üe - which is officially located in neighbouring St. Pauli quarter - by the underground line U3 only. Schlump station is located on the north eastern boundaries of the Sternschanze quarter and served by underground lines U2 and U3.

The erosional process includes the thawing of ice sediments by a strong water flow and once the surface is unfrozen, mechanical erosion occurs only if hydraulic forces are powerful enough to incise the riverbank material. This kind of erosion sometimes causes the banks to collapse into the river, and when this occurs collapses are commonly controlled by ice wedges. Rivers where this process has been observed include the Lena, the Colville River delta, and the Yukon River. The Yakutia region in Central Siberia, where the Lena River is located, is an exceptional point of interest to study this type of erosion based on its record low temperatures and extreme thickness of permafrost. During the winter when water level is low, a thick sheet of ice forms on top of the Lena River, that is sometimes as much as 2 m thick. Seasonal floods caused by rapid snowmelt and irregular storms then break the ice apart in the summer, exposing the banks of the river to the power of erosion. There are two stages to this process: the first is the breakup of the ice and the second is the flooding. Over the course of just a few days in May or June, water discharge can increase by 10x its velocity. The force of the water causes the ice sitting on top of the river to break apart, and these broken pieces are thrust up onto the riverbanks, sometimes forming an ice barrier that as high as 10m tall that will protect the banks from erosion for a short time. However, as the flood continues, the warmth and mechanical energy from the water melts the ice barrier, giving way for the fluvio-thermal erosion of the frozen riverbanks. For the Lena, the banks are observed to retreat approximately 40 m per year. Based on lab models carried out in a cold room, high water temperature, ice temperature, and discharge are shown to be the main contributors of thermal erosion, whereas high ice content in the soil is shown to slow down the thermal erosion process. Melting of the ice within a porous material reduces the strength of the material, rendering it easily breakable and removable. During the melting period of a periglacial river in the summer, due to a relatively high water discharge, the unfrozen sediments are weathered away. In conclusion, water discharge in permanent contact with permafrost banks creates a combination of thermal and mechanical erosion. References * Costard, Francois, E. Gautier, A. Fedorov, P.

In 1933, Davidson invited Rev. Finis Dake to lead Sunday afternoon prayer meetings in the vacant Cameo Theater in Kenosha. Prayer meetings turned into Christian Assembly church, which was chartered with the Assemblies of God denomination on February 18, 1935. The Assemblies of God, headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, is rooted in a religious revival that began in the late 1800s, and is based on biblical and spiritual experiences. =Previous locations= The church purchased property at 2500 Roosevelt Rd. in Kenosha with Otis Keener as the founding pastor. In 1939, the name was changed from Christian Assembly to Assembly of God. A radio broadcast began around the same time, and ran until about 1970. Journey Church congregation's second location under construction at 60th St. and Pershing Blvd. in Kenosha A new building located at 60th St. and Pershing Blvd. in Kenosha was completed in 1960, accompanied by the new name Kenosha First Assembly of God.

Peniel Tabernacle joined Kenosha First Assembly in 1981, and church attendance rose to over 1000 during the 1980s. =Current location= Consistent higher attendance required a new location, and they wanted to be near Interstate 94 and 75th St. for easy access. In 1987, 137 acres of land at 10700 75th St. was purchased. A developer and other businesses purchased parcels throughout the 1990s, enabling the church to pay off land debt and retain 45 acres. Christian Life School and Kenosha First Assembly occupied the current building in early 1993. Pastor Dan Remus began his role as senior pastor in 1995, after being the youth pastor since 1980. Pastor Kevin Taylor started as worship director in 1996, and started his role as co-lead pastor in 2006.

It is similar in design to the Bersa Thunder 380 and Bersa Thunder 22 pistol, but also with design features in common with the Walther PPK. Development The Thunder 32 was a part of the Bersa thunder series lineup, which includes the Thunder 22, Thunder 22-6, Thunder 380, Thunder 9, Mini Thunder 9, Mini Thunder 40, and Mini Thunder 45. Although the Thunder 32 has been discontinued since June 2012, parts are still available on the Bersa/Eagle Imports website and contains parts that are interchangeable with the other compact thunder series. A light variant of the Thunder 32, called the 'Concealed Carry' model (or 32CC). variants 'Firestorm 380' 'Firestorm 32' and 'Firestorm 22' are sold by Firestorm SGS of New Jersey; assembled from parts manufactured by Bersa. Intended market The Thunder 32 may be intended for general civilian use, especially the concealed carry market with its concealed carry version. Design advantages Similar to the Thunder 380 and Thunder 22, the Thunder 32 has a light aluminum alloy frame that reduces weight for easier carry, yet the pistol still retains enough mass (weight) to help tame recoil, although recoil is very light using the .32 ACP cartridge. Due to the small frame, the pistol is very well suited for female firers, and males with smaller hands. However, due to its blowback design the recoil spring is designed to be stronger than usual, which may make it difficult to rack the slide. The magazines, however are designed with an extra section of grip, so that all fingers of the firing hand are accommodated. The blowback, fixed-barrel design theoretically aids accuracy. The nearly straight-in alignment of the chamber and the topmost cartridge in the magazine seems to be responsible for the pistol's reliable chambering and cycling. The frame features a long rearward tang over the grips, which effectively protects the shooter's thumb web from hammer-bite or slide-bite. There are several safety features built into the Thunder 32: a slide mounted manual safety and decocker that blocks the hammer, a magazine disconnect safety that prevents firing if a magazine is not inserted, a long double-action (DA) first trigger pull, an inertial firing pin, and (in some models) an integral key-operated trigger lock. Some versions also feature an automatic firing pin block. The pistol has a rear sight windage adjustment.

Mission and services CVLAS is one of 10 legal aid services in Virginia. The geographical area it covers includes the cities of Richmond, Petersburg, Hopewell, Colonial Heights and Charlottesville, as well as the counties of Albemarle, Charles City, Chesterfield, Dinwiddie, Fluvanna, Goochland, Greene, Hanover, Henrico, Louisa, Nelson, New Kent, Powhatan, Prince George and Surry. It has offices in Richmond, Charlottesville and Petersburg. CVLAS provides legal advice primarily in the areas of bankruptcy, consumer and disability rights, employment law, housing law, family law, and public benefits. Through the Legal Services Corporation, it receives federal funding and is thus subject to specific restrictions: The society and its employees may not be affiliated with a political party, support a specific candidate, lobby for legislation or represent criminal clients, among other activities. The society primarily represents individuals with incomes under 125% of the poverty line, although it may accept clients earning up to 200% of the poverty line. It also represents people over the age of 60, even if they do not meet the income qualifications. Its services include legal advice, briefs, negotiation, litigation, and representation in administrative hearings, as well as community education and activities in partnership with other local, state, and national legal aid groups. The Richmond office has the resources to help only 4,000 to 5,000 low-income residents a year. According to the Virginia State Bar, Virginia has one lawyer for every 349 people, but just one legal aid lawyer for every 6,200 residents living in poverty. CVLAS hosts a local radio show titled It's Time for Justice, broadcast every Wednesday from 12:30 to 1:00 p.m. on WRIR-LP. The host is Martin D. Wegbreit, CVLAS's director of litigation. The show includes news, interviews, and answers to listeners' questions about consumer, employment, family, housing, public benefits, and other civil law. Partnerships Attorneys in CVLAS's Richmond office run free workshops and information sessions on subjects such as power of attorney and writing wills, and the organization works with local law students through the No Fault Divorce Program at the University of Richmond School of Law. The Charlottesville office partnered with the University of Virginia to create the Sexual Assault Advocacy Fund (SAAF), whose goal is to provide support to survivors of sexual assault on college campuses. CVLAS is also involved in the Medical-Legal Partnership, Richmond (MLP-R), a collaboration with the VCU Health System (part of Virginia Commonwealth University), the University of Richmond School of Law, the Legal Aid Justice Center, and the Legal Information Network for Cancer. The partnership provides free legal services to the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU (MLP-R at Pediatrics), VCU's Massey Cancer Center (MLP-R at Massey) and VCU's Hayes Willis Center of South Richmond (MLP-R at Hayes Willis).

The company changed its name in 2005 to StoredIQ and continued to operate successfully for over a decade until it was acquired in 2012 by IBM. It now serves as a platform for IBM's information life cycle governance, big data governance and enterprise content management technologies. StoredIQ was awarded five patents by the USPTO. The first, originally filed in 2003, enabled unstructured data in file systems to be manipulated in a similar way to information stored in databases. Subsequent patents only added to StoredIQ's market dominance by building upon the patented actionable file system with further enhancements specific to Enterprise Policy Management and expanding the reach of StoredIQ's management capability all the way to individual desktops. In 2008 StoredIQ was recognized as \\"Best in Compliance\\" by Network Products Guide. At the same time, StoredIQ was being recognized as a \\"Top 5 Provider\\" by the prestigious Socha-Gelbmann eDiscovery survey.

Today JPSM offers coursework on-site and online, offering MS and Ph.D. degrees, certificate programs, and short courses on the subjects of Survey Methodology, Survey Statistics, and Data Science.  History  In the early 1990s, the U.S. federal statistical system (Interagency Council on Statistical Policy) sought assistance to provide advanced training to their employees in survey statistics and methodology. Employees who had graduate degrees from traditional statistics programs lacked knowledge on the design of complex samples and developing survey instruments‚Äîinterdisciplinary training which was necessary for implementing large-scale national surveys and censuses. In order to accomplish this initiative, the National Science Foundation set up a grant that would provide an initial five years of funding for a University to establish this program. The grant was awarded to the Joint Program in Survey Methodology (JPSM), a group made up by the University of Maryland, College Park, the University of Michigan, and Westat, and was headquartered at the University of Maryland, College Park. Academic courses began in Fall 1993, under the heading of the first JPSM director, sociologist Stanley Presser. The second director of JPSM, serving from 1996 to 2001 was Robert Groves, who went on to later head the US Census Bureau. In 1998, a summer internship program was added for undergraduate students which linked them to paid internships at U.S. federal statistical agencies as well as offering coursework in survey methodology. In 2000, JPSM enrolled their first Ph.D. students, in both statistical and social science concentrations of survey methodology. Survey methodologist, Roger Tourangeau, was named the director of JPSM in 2001 and served through 2011. The fourth JPSM director, Frederick Conrad, served from 2012 to 2015. JPSM is currently headed by Frauke Kreuter, who is also Professor of Statistics and Methodology at the University of Mannheim and head of the Statistical Methods Research Department at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in N√ºrnberg, Germany.  Present  Currently, JPSM offers both MS and Ph.D. programs, in addition to an undergraduate minor, graduate-level certificates, online courses, and short (1-2 day) courses to meet the needs of survey professionals. In addition, JPSM offers a summer program for undergraduate students with internship placements at statistical agencies. To greater strengthen JPSM's collaboration with the federal statistical agencies, many agencies, such as the US Census Bureau, the National Center of Health Statistics, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, have employed JPSM students as research assistants. Federal agencies also provide real world problems that are taken on by students in practicum or design seminar classes. Graduates of the JPSM programs are employed by federal agencies, by industry survey organizations, such as Westat, Mathematica Policy Research, Gallup, and the Pew Center, as well as university survey organizations such as the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research and NORC at the University of Chicago. JPSM is also a core partner, along with the University of Mannheim (Germany), in a new International Program in Survey and Data Science (IPSDS), allowing international survey researchers to learn survey methodology courses online from international experts in the field.

One of the 2 in the Municipality of Athens, it serves all intercity trains as well as regional traffic and is the one closest to the city center, thus being the most important. Until 2005, the station had 4 tracks, all of which were served by platforms, as well as storage areas and sidings for freight trains, which were situated in the western side. The old, now dismantled metre gauge line to the Peloponesse was further west and there were no platforms to serve it: the Peloponissou Station further south was the calling point for these trains. After works for the expansion of the station begun in 2016, the sidings and storage areas were demolished and the metre gauge line was closed and the tracks were lifted. Construction for 6 additional tracks and platforms had already begun. During construction, the station remains open, with only 3 operational tracks.

Talepasand's own booth featured souvenir-type items for sale such as t-shirts, magnets and CDs, highlighting the relationship between consumer culture and the arts but also addressing Orientalism. Artists participating in the exhibition included; Hushidar Mortezaie, Morehshin Allahyari, Haleh Niazmand, Ala Ebtekar, Sanaz Mazinani, Ali Dadgar and Gelare Khoshgozaran. Her work has been featured in Art in America, The Huffington Post, New American Paintings, Art Papers, The Boston Globe, SOMA Magazine and many more. Talepasand has exhibited her work in United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Talepasand was one of forty artists selected by the Orange County Museum of Art for the 2010 California Biennial. Her works have been added to the permanent museum collections at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF) at the De Young Museum and the Orange County Museum of Art.

He is the Director of the _Snite Museum of Art_ at the University of Notre Dame; concurrently, he is a professor of art history in the university's department of Art, Art History and Design. Formerly, he was the Chief Curator and Vice President of Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he directed the departments of Sculpture and Sculpture Exhibitions, Horticulture and Annual Exhibitions, Communications and Public Relations. Additionally, Becherer served as the Lena Meijer Professor in the History of Art at Aquinas College where he taught courses in Renaissance, Baroque, and Contemporary Art.  Early life  Becherer was born in Canton, Ohio to Joseph and Joanne Becherer and attended Catholic schools. He uses the name Antenucci in honor of his maternal grandmother, Rose Antenucci. At Canton Central Catholic he developed a serious interest in art and literature. He attended Ohio University on scholarship and received a BFA and an MFA in Art History with minors in English Literature and Studio Art. For several semesters he studied in Rome, Florence and London. A seminar on Donatello opened his interest in three dimensional forms. His mentor was Marilyn Bradshaw PhD, a Renaissance scholar, but he wrote his thesis on the Modern painter and printmaker, Georges Rouault. After initial teaching assignments and museum work, he enrolled at Indiana University, Bloomington. He completed his PhD under the direction of Bruce Cole, Distinguished Professor and later Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. His dissertation focused on Pietro Perugino and the foundations of American collecting.  Career  Following a period of teaching at Ohio University as a sabbatical replacement, Becherer moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan. During the 1991-1992 academic year he developed an art history program for Grand Rapids Community College, and successively served as Department Chair, Assistant Dean and then Dean of Arts, Liberal Arts and Social Sciences leading more than 120 faculty. Simultaneous, he did consultation work for Prentice-Hall publishing and the Grand Rapids Art Museum. For the later he organized the landmark exhibition, ‚ÄúPietro Perugino: Master of the Italian Renaissance‚Äù in 1997-1998 ‚Äì the first of its kind anywhere in the world. After a period of consulting work, Becherer officially joined Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in 1999. The organization was only four years old when he became the founding director and curator of the now internationally renowned sculpture program helping to realize the vision of retail magnate and philanthropist, Frederik Meijer. Becherer also began teaching upper divisions classes at Aquinas College. At Meijer Gardens, Becherer developed a permanent collection opening in the late 19th century with iconic works by Auguste Rodin, Aristide Maillol, Jacques Lipchitz and Joan Miro, to Louise Nevelson and Barbara Hepworth, Mark di Suvero, Hanneke Beaumont and Beverly Pepper, Richard Serra and Jaume Plensa, Antony Gormley and Louise Bourgeois. In all the collection hosts more than 300 works across the campus including at 25 acre sculpture, but in concert with gardens and natural environments across the 158 acre campus. In 2015, Meijer Gardens opened the Richard and Helen DeVos Japanese Gardens designed by Hoichi Kurisu including iconic works by Anish Kapoor, Jenny Holzer, Zhang Huan and Giuseppe Penone among others. In addition, he has developed a major collection of works on paper, models and maquettes for the organization. Thus far, Becherer has organized nearly fifty exhibitions including retrospectives for Jim Dine (sculpture), Beverly Pepper and George Segal. He has published dozens of books, catalogs, essays and articles. Independently, he lectures and advises on projects across the country, Europe, Japan and China.  Civic and Professional Projects  Becherer has served on numerous national and international projects including those commissioning major public works by Dennis Oppenheim and Maya Lin.

Life He was born in Horwich in 1839, the youngest child of Henry and Mary Hampson. He was baptised at Holy Trinity Church, Horwich on 10 November 1839. His father died in May 1842, leaving his mother to bring up the children on her own. He started work at Wallsuches bleach works in Horwich when he was seven-years-old. He married Sarah Jane Aldred at Holy Trinity Church, Horwich on 2 April 1866. They had three sons: John Henry, John Fox, and Benjamin, and three daughters: Clara, Mary Ann, and Eleanor. After his marriage, he continued to be employed at the bleach works as a finisher, but between 1877 and 1881 he lost a number of fingers on his left hand in a works accident which seems to have forced him into a clerical career. He was a secretary at the short-lived Red Moss Ironworks, Horwich. Then employed as a cashier, first at Scot Lane Colliery, Blackrod, then at Fourgates Colliery, Wingates, Westhoughton. It was around this period of his life he wrote a number of notable local history books. He published History of Blackrod in 1882, Horwich: Its History, Legends, and Church in 1883, and History of Rivington in 1893. After Horwich Works were built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) in 1886, he was employed as a labourer in the iron foundry, then as a locomotive stores keeper.

The design was derived from Versabar's earlier VB-4000 (aka Bottom Feeder), which was developed to clear debris from toppled oil drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Instead of sending divers to section the wreckage into pieces, the heavy-lift capability facilitates salvaging the platform as a single piece. The primary benefit is increasing safety by reducing the number of high-risk diving activities, but substantial cost savings can be realized by reducing the number of lifts and shortening the decommissioning schedule. VB-10,000 is the largest lift vessel ever built in the United States. The color and shape of the trusses on VB-10,000 have prompted comparisons to the famed McDonald's signature Golden Arches. Design capabilities Each truss is nearly at its highest point, with a hook height of . The truss sections are decoupled from the motion of the barges by using specially-designed hinges. Each truss has a \\"wide\\" side and a \\"narrow\\" side, denoting the relative footprint of the truss-to-barge connection. The \\"wide\\" side is essentially pinned to the barge with a single degree of freedom (rotational). The \\"narrow\\" side has the specially-designed double joint allowing two rotational degrees of freedom. Each barge has one narrow and one wide interface. The hinges use Trelleborg AB Orkot bearings, a composite material which provide a longer life and lowered maintenance compared to the lubricated bronze bearings used in Bottom Feeder. Once the wreck has been lifted clear of the water, there is of clearance between the two barge hulls for a separate cargo barge to enter. The load may be placed onto the separate barge for transportation. VB-10,000 is capable of lifting in a single lift, nearly doubling the capacity of its predecessor. Each barge is approximately long by in beam, and each barge carries four dynamic positioning thrusters for station keeping without anchors and mooring lines. The dynamic positioning system is rated to class 3 standards (ABS Class DPS-3). Claw and VB-10,000 near homeport of Port Arthur, Texas Versabar developed \\"The Claw\\" at Chevron's request. \\"The Claw\\" is a gantry-suspended submersible grappling device designed to retrieve sunken debris without sending divers to attach rigging. Each gantry on VB-10,000 can support a single Claw, and each Claw is capable of lifting from locations as deep as underwater. The total lifting capacity of a single Claw is , but the claw itself weighs . Initial sketches for the Claw were developed in December 2010, and the Claw was first deployed in August 2011. History =Construction= Bottom Feeder lifted more than during more than 100 subsea lift operations in its first four seasons of operation. Upon reviewing the operating experience and refit plans, Versabar realized that modifications to increase hook height and lifting capacity of Bottom Feeder would be better accomplished with a completely new build. However, the larger trusses planned for VB-10,000 each weighed , meaning that each truss would have to be built in two separate sections and then mated together, as none of the cranes at the yard were capable of lifting a completed truss. Falsework was used to support one section while the two sections were welded together, and self-propelled modular transporters moved the trusses onto one barge. Once the trusses were secured to one barge, the transporters were moved to the other half of the trusses to move them onto the second barge. After construction was complete, each gantry was proof tested with a load. VB-10,000 was towed from the yard on . Versabar announced that preliminary design work on a larger successor for operations outside the Gulf of Mexico was under way in April 2015. =Operations= VB-10,000 performed its first lift on , a topside and jacket which had toppled during a storm at Vermilion 285. Approximately a week later, VB-10,000 retrieved a topside which had been damaged by fire. The Claw was used in 20 lift projects during its first year of deployment.

The company was formed when Steve Dashew purchased Prewitt Fiberglass Animals and acquired all of the molds created by Bob Prewitt. One of the molds which Dashew acquired in the transaction was a 20-foot human figure, which Prewitt had used in 1962 to create an oversized statue for the Paul Bunyan Cafe in Flagstaff, Arizona. The company had made fiberglass boats, but Dashew decided to use the mold to create some business during slow boat- building periods.

He continued his research at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico (1977-1987). Scientific contributions Baldwin's fields of research included photo-nuclear reactions with bremsstrahlung radiation from electron accelerators, resulting in the discovery of the giant dipole resonance; orbit dynamics of synchrotrons; nuclear reactor physics; electrical propulsion for space; low-energy electron scattering in gases; nonlinear optics; and investigation of the feasibility of a gamma-ray laser. His early research involved perfecting GE's 100 MeV Betatron for use as an x-ray source. Using bremsstrahlung radiation from the betatron beam, he and G. S. Klaiber excited uranium nuclei and observed a prominent peak at about 20 MeV in the cross section for photons (1947), (1948), which was not anticipated by the nuclear physics community. This \\"giant dipole resonance\\" discovered by Baldwin and Klaiber was subsequently explained theoretically by Edward Teller and Maurice Goldhaber, and others. Baldwin's research with low-energy electron scattering on noble gases extended the scattering cross-section data to very low energies, well under 1 eV (1967), a technically difficult task. His book \\"An Introduction to Nonlinear Optics\\" (1969) helped bridge the gap in knowledge between specialists in the field and engineers and technical managers involved with this new technology. Baldwin, along with GE colleagues, developed ideas for nuclear radiation analogues of the optical laser, now known as the gamma-ray laser, or Gamma-Ray Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (GRASER). He launched international efforts to define and quantify issues facing the development of this advanced idea, working with many academic colleagues, including R. V. Khokhlov and V. I. Gol'danskii of the USSR and J. C. Solem of Los Alamos, opening an entirely new field of physics and making bold, creative attempts to bring the concept to fruition (1963), (1965), (1975). He authored an early bibliography of literature on the problem of developing gamma-ray lasers, covering the period 1917 through 1979 (1979). Baldwin investigated methods for detecting nuclear stimulated emission, seeking to demonstrate coherent emission from nuclear states, but establishing that a number of innovative ideas were unworkable. He and his colleagues identified criteria necessary for the process of laser action at gamma-ray energies. He collaborated on theoretical issues, on experiments to demonstrate isomer separation by selective photoionization (1983), and on modeling of the kinetics of gamma-ray lasers. Decades of his gamma-ray laser work, together with that of others, is assessed in a paper (1981) and a second assessment concentrates on later work on recoilless gamma-ray lasers (1997). These review papers contain an extensive list of references. He collaborated with J. C. Solem on research on the use of x-ray microholography to image biological specimens (1982). Personal life Baldwin's 57-year marriage to his wife Winifred, who collaborated as copy editor and typist for many of his publications, produced three children and seven grandchildren, of these three obtained a college degree in physics. Baldwin was an avid amateur astronomer, grinding his own lenses and building his own telescopes; fisherman; self-taught pianist, entertaining friends by playing by ear; and historical researcher. One of Baldwin's notable accomplishments was locating an inscription left by the Dominguez-Escalante expedition of 1776, discovered originally in 1884 by his father on a surveying expedition in northern Arizona. Baldwin organized the 1995/1996 Museum of New Mexico expeditions that found the Escalante inscription and documented this in the Journal of the Southwest (1999).

He has been a member of the Chicago Eagles (CIFL), Cincinnati Bengals (NFL), Okanagan Sun (CJFL), Baltimore Brigade (AFL), and BC Lions (CFL).  Early years  Rashaun Simonise (Sy-mo-ny-z) is a coach's son. He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He is the son of John Simonise (who is of Haitian descent). He was an elite play-maker at quarterback, running back, wide receiver, tight end, corner, safety. Rashaun was known for his electrifying kick returns and punt returns and was the type of play-maker to make big plays in crucial situations. He led the Vancouver College Irish (Christian Covington also attended) through the playoffs all the way to the BCHS championship where they had unfortunately came up short. Simonise led all receivers in playoffs with 238 yards in 3 games with 5 touchdowns. Rashaun Simonise averaged 79 yards per game throughout the playoffs. On the defensive side of the ball, Rashaun made 27 solo tackles, and 3 interceptions through the playoffs. Rashaun had managed to play for 2 football teams throughout his high school career giving him back to back gamedays every weekend with games on Friday and Saturdays. Simonise has dressed for every single game he has been a part of, excusing one game in college where he was ruled ineligible. Simonise was also a competitive basketball star and had also dominated in track and field running all sprint and jumping events.  College career  = Freshman season = Rashaun Simonise came into the University of Calgary and started every game as a true freshman (18 years old). Rashaun hauled in 33 receptions and 481 yards with 1 touchdown on the offensive side of the ball, along with 111 kick return yards on the season which earned him the Canada West Rookie of the Year. Rashaun had contributed in the playoffs catching 4 receptions for 112 yards and 2 touchdowns, with 18 returns for 163 yards and 2 touchdowns. His big play ability was shown off in front of a huge showcase in the Vanier Cup National Championship in Laval, Quebec where he brought in a 47-yard reception to change the momentum of the game in the Dino's favour but unfortunately had torn his meniscus just a play after the catch causing him to leave the game. = Sophomore season = Rashaun had brought in 20 receptions for 391 yards and 1 touchdown his sophomore regular season. In the playoffs he had 200 yards receiving on 11 receptions and 3 touchdowns in only 2 games. He also had 2 kick returns for 61 yards. = Junior season = Simonise had his break-out season in his junior year and tied for the lead in Canada in touchdowns with 11. He also had 1,013 yards and 65 catches in only 8 games. Simonise was averaging 134.9 yards per game with 22 yards per catch giving him national attention. His most notable night came against University of Alberta where he racked up 9 catches for 272 yards and 3 touchdowns. Simonise also had 4 receptions that were all longer than 30 yards but were called back because of penalties. Rashaun was named 1st team all Canadian and was the number one ranked receiver in Canada. After an outstanding 2015 season he was academically ineligible for the 2016 season. Six teams scouted Simonise including the Los Angeles Rams who used a supplementary pick in the 2015 NFL Draft on Isaiah Battle. Professional career = CIF = In 2016 Simonise played for the Chicago Eagles of Champions Indoor Football (CIF). He played in 5 games catching 11 passes for 105 yards with 2 touchdowns. He then had a workout with the Jacksonville Sharks of the Arena Football League (AFL), but was not signed because of his NFL pro day opportunity. = NFL = Simonise signed with the Cincinnati Bengals after going undrafted in the 2016 NFL supplemental draft. Rashaun Simonise tested positive for a performance- enhancing drug during his time in Cincinnati Bengals' training camp. During his short time there he had accumulated 64 yards on two catches during the preseason. On September 3, 2016, he was waived by the Bengals. = AFL = On March 28, 2018, Simonise was assigned to the Baltimore Brigade of the Arena Football League (AFL). = CJFL = Two weeks after being released by the Cincinnati Bengals Simonise signed with the Okanagan Sun of the Canadian Junior Football League (CJFL). He played two seasons with the Sun, 2016 and 2017, playing a total of seven games, catching 23 passes for 392 yards with three touchdowns. = CFL = As a result of Simonise's positive performance- enhancing drug test with his time in Cincinnati his CFL draft status was deferred from 2017 to 2018. Heading into the 2017 draft Simonise had been the No. 7 ranked prospect in September 2016 and then moved up to No. 4 in December 2016. Rashaun Simonise was the ninth ranked prospect entering the 2018 CFL Draft. He was selected by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the second round (12th overall) in the 2018 CFL Draft.  Stature  Rashaun has been compared to a mixture of AJ Green, Julio Jones and Randy Moss in stature.  Personal life  Rashaun's favourite football players are Randy Moss, Josh Gordon, and AJ Green. He was a competitive basketball player in high school and was a star player in his province. Rashaun has three younger siblings.

Breeding Margrave was bred by August Belmont Jr. at his Nursery Stud near Lexington, Kentucky. He was sired by 1883 Epsom Derby winner St. Blaise who had originally been imported into the United States by August Belmont Sr. to stand at his Nursery Stud which at the time was located in Babylon, New York. After Belmont Sr.'s death in 1890, St. Blaise was sold several times and before Belmont Jr. bought him back. Margrave's dam was Lady Margaret, a Belmont family bred multiple stakes winning mare who also was the dam of Masterman, winner of the 1902 Belmont Stakes. Lady Margaret was sired by the Belmont stallion The Ill-Used who was the sire of other very good runners including His Highness, who won the 1891 Futurity Stakes, Forester, winner of the 1882 Withers and Belmont Stakes, Jacobus who won the 1883 Preakness Stakes plus 1892 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly Lady Violet. Racing Margrave was trained by Byron McClelland who had previously won the 1895 Kentucky Derby with Halma and the 1894 Belmont Stakes with Henry of Navarre. As a two-year-old, Margrave won two minor races and notably beat Ben Brush while finishing second in the 1895 Great Eastern Handicap at Sheepshead Bay Race Track. Racing at age three, Margrave was never beaten in five outings. In addition to his Preakness Stakes win at Gravesend Race Track, at that same track he also won the 1896 Boulevard Stakes and Hempstead Handicap and at Sheepshead Bay, the Tidal Stakes. Margrave met with limited success as a stallion for his owner's Nursery Stud but did produce 1902 Queens County Handicap winner Margraviate.

She was the frontwoman for the punk rock band Perfect Pussy. In addition to making her own music, she runs independent music label Honor Press and serves as director of music for the crowdfunding site Kickstarter. Graves is also a writer and music journalist, and has served as an anchor at MTV News. Early life Meredith Graves was born on September 5, 1987. Graves began playing piano and guitar at age 11, and touring by age 19; her mother is also a performer, in musical theater. Her father is a journalist. Graves learned to sew in high school and worked as a seamstress during and after college. Career Early in her music career, Graves led a band called Mouse and the Love & Light Orkestra. =Shoppers= Graves was a guitarist and vocalist for Syracuse noise rock trio, Shoppers. The A.V. Club described their 2011 release Silver Year as \\"a short, intense breakup album about the terrible things we‚Äôre capable of when our feelings are hurt;\\" Punk News called it \\"top notch noise-rock.\\" =Perfect Pussy= Graves next became frontwoman for the hardcore punk band Perfect Pussy, founded in 2012 in Syracuse, New York. After Shoppers disbanded, film director Scott Coffey asked Graves to appear in his movie Adult World, shooting in upstate New York. Graves assembled a \\"fake band\\" and wrote a song for the film, but even after filming, the group continued performing together, and posted their first demo I Have Lost All Desire for Feeling to Bandcamp in 2013. In Billboard, Reggie Ugwu described the demo as \\"purpose-filled, bone- rattling and brisk, the kind of electrically charged debut that can shock a jaded blogger out of his torpor.\\" Ugwu noted \\"Graves‚Äô hyper-literate, rapid- fire prose\\" on Perfect Pussy's 2014 LP Say Yes to Love. Say Yes to Love's release included a limited edition vinyl pressing of the record mixed with Graves's menstrual blood, which quickly sold out. Perfect Pussy dissolved in January 2016. =Honor Press= In 2015, Graves founded a music label called Honor Press. Though Graves's own background is in hardcore, Honor Press is not an exclusively punk label; instead Graves describes the label's priorities as \\"No snobs, no phonies and no shitheads.\\" She told New York that her positive experience making music for the label Captured Tracks had been the inspiration for Honor Press. Honor Press's first release was Sacramento band So Stressed's The Unlawful Trade of Greco-Roman Art. Released in May 2015, Spin reviewed Unlawful Trade as a \\"strikingly sour premiere effort [that] comes courtesy of Meredith Graves' Honor Press label...one of the most potent post-hardcore assaults in recent memory.\\" Graves has indicated plans to publish books through Honor Press as well as music. The label's second signee is Los Angeles rapper Busdriver, also known as Regan John Farquhar, to produce a book and a 7\\". The book will be a poetry collection called Hat: A Movie. Honor Press is located in Brooklyn, New York. =Writing= From 2015 to 2016, Graves was a columnist for the Village Voice, writing a food and music series called Recipe for Disaster. She has also written for The Guardian, Pitchfork, Rookie, and Talkhouse; Racked praises her as \\"incredibly honest and thoughtful writer.\\" Graves has drawn particular notice for commentary on topics like authenticity and double standards for women in music. =Other projects= In 2014, Graves announced she would put out a solo record, as well as a split with Kevin Devine. She debuted the solo project's first song, \\"Take the Ghost to the Movies,\\" in 2015. Stereogum called it \\"one of those songs that you want to blast in your headphones when the world feels like it‚Äôs too much and you want to block everything out, a noise dirge to silence the cacophony of the outside world.\\" In 2016, Graves was featured as the vocalist on the House of Feelings song \\"Avatar\\"; in Pitchfork, Philip Sherburne described her performance as \\"channel[ing] the stunned demeanor of someone who‚Äôs just clocked into her first day at work and is already numb to the grind.\\" In 2016, Graves became an anchor for MTV News.

The Society is dedicated to improving the care and outcomes of patients with life-threatening neurologic illnesses in the intensive care unit. Common illnesses requiring neurocritical care include ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, coma, and status epilepticus. Its members are health professionals providing care to critically ill and injured patients. The Society supports research and education, and advocates on issues related to neurointensive care, neurocritical care, and general critical care. The society's headquarters is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota USA. Although a great percentage of the members are healthcare practitioners in the USA, the society is international and includes members from multiple healthcare disciplines all over the world History of NCS The Neurocritical Care Society was formed in 2002 with Dr. Thomas P. Bleck as the founding president. The society‚Äôs first annual meeting was held in Phoenix, AZ in February 2003, and it has expanded to a current membership in excess of 1000 members. NCS is an interdisciplinary society, with membership roles spanning multiple physician disciplines, nursing, advanced practice providers, pharmacists and other allied health providers who specialize in the care of patients with severe neurological illness. In the early years, the path to physician board certification in neurocritical care often involved dual residency training in neurology as well as internal medicine because critical care experience was not available to neurology residents. Fellowship training in neurocritical care now constitutes a minimum of 2 years with focused training in general critical care and neurologic critical care. Neurocritical care as a subspecialty was accepted in the USA by the United Council of Neurological Subspecialties (UCNS) in 2006. The first neurocritical care board examination was held in 2007, and currently there are over a 1000 certified diplomates. Conferences The first annual conference was held in Phoenix, AZ in 2003 and has continued annually since then. The 14th conference was in Washington DC, and the 15th Annual Meeting was Hawaii in October, 2017. Patient Information NCS has a number of resources for patients and families affected by devastating neurologic illness. Survivors have contributed a number of Stories of Hope. The society also publishes a Guide to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and a patient and family brochure. Additional information may be found on the NCS website (www.neurocriticalcare.org). Guidelines The Neurocritical Care Society has published multiple evidence-based, peer- reviewed scientific guidelines on the management of different disease states within neurocritical care that are available for medical practitioners worldwide. These guidelines are available at NCS Guidelines. The following guidelines have been published: *The Implementation of Targeted Temperature Management *The Insertion and Management of External Ventricular Drains *Guideline for Reversal of Antithrombotics in Intracranial Hemorrhage *Prophylaxis of Venous Thrombosis in Neurocritical Care Patients *Evidence- based Guidelines for the Management of Large Hemispheric Infarction *Recommendations For the Critical Care Management of Devastating Brain Injury: Prognostication, Psychosocial, and Ethical Management *Consensus Summary Statement of the International Multidisciplinary Consensus Conference on Multimodality Monitoring in Neurocritical Care *Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Status Epilepticus *Critical Care Management of Patients Following Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Publications The Neurocritical Care Society began publication of the Neurocritical Care Journal in Spring 2004, and since then, the Neurocritical Care journal has continued publication with Eelco Wijdinks as the Editor-in-Chief.

The aim was to counter any negative image of religion that may have resulted from the attacks, and to formulate a \\"Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the World's Religions\\".  Brief account of the conferences  Religion in general began to acquire a negative connotation after the events of September 11, 2001 on account of the close association of these events with Islamic fundamentalism. Many in the academic and faith communities, however, felt that such a negative image of religion was detrimental to the future of humanity because religion is a major force in human affairs which can be harnessed for either good or evil. Many members of these communities also felt that associating religion exclusively with evil was not only historically inaccurate, it also deprived humanity of a major source of promoting well- being. A series of conferences was therefore organized to emphasize that religion can play a positive role in human affairs, and to evolve a Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the World's religions. The motto of the first global conference which met September 11‚Äì15, 2006, and was inaugurated by the Iranian Peace laureate Madam Shirin Ebadi was: \\"Can religion be a force for good?\\" The second global conference met on September 4, 2011. It was inaugurated by Nobel Peace laureate the Dalai Lama with the motto: \\"Peace through religion.\\" The third conference met on September 15, 2016, at the Palais des Congr√®s in Montreal, Canada. The motto of this conference was\\" From Faith to Interfaith\\". The theme which unifies all these conferences is that of evolving a Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the World's Religions, a project which was launched in Montreal in 1998 on the occasion of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations.  Importance of these conferences ‚Äì The interface of religion and human rights  The relationship of the religions of the world and human rights has been a much debated issue ever since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948 by the United Nations. Two basic approaches to this relationship are prominent. According to one, religions have a negative relationship to human rights inasmuch as human rights discourse provides a norm in the light of which the doctrines and practices of the world's religions could be judged. Such an attempt reveals that religions often fall short of meeting human rights norms and therefore the relationship of religion to human rights acquires a negative aspect. Another view takes a somewhat opposite position. According to it, the religions of the world played a major role in the very formulation of human rights and can offer fresh perspectives on ways to secure human flourishing, which is the obvious goal of human rights discourse. This more positive approach to the relationship between religion and human rights is evident in the various documents on human rights produced by the religions of the world, some of which are enumerated below. # Pacem in Terris (Peace on Earth), June 23, 1963 # Declaration on Judaism and Human Rights, adopted in Montreal on April 23, 1974 # a) Universal Islamic Declaration of Human Rights, September 19, 1981; b) The Dhaka Declaration of Human Rights in Islam, 1983; c) The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, August 5, 1990; d) The Arab Charter on Human Rights, 22 May 2004 # Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the Hindus, June 27, 1999 All these and similar declarations engage the issue of religion and human rights but from the perspective of only a single religious tradition, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and so on. The three conferences mentioned above represent a progressive effort to formulate a joint response from the world's religions to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by way of formulating a Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the World's Religions, a project which has the support of five Nobel Peace laureates who are its patrons: the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Madam Shirin Ebadi, Bishop Belo of Timor Leste, and Professor Elie Wiesel.

Green banks use public funds to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies that, despite being commercially viable, have struggled to establish a widespread presence in consumer markets.U.S. Department of Energy. \\"Energy Investment Partnerships: How State and Local Governments Are Engaging Private Capital to Drive Clean Energy Investment\\" Green banks seek to reduce energy costs for ratepayers, stimulate private sector investment and economic activity, and expedite the transition to a low-carbon economy. In the United States, green banks have been created at the state and local levels. The United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and Malaysia have all created national banks dedicated to leveraging private investment in clean energy technologies.Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \\"Green Investment Banks: Scaling Up Private Investment in Low-Carbon, Climate Resilient Infrastructure Together, green banks around the world have driven approximately $30 billion of clean energy investment.http://greenbanknetwork.org/gbn-impact/ History In the US, the green bank concept was originally developed by Reed Hundt and Ken Berlin, as a part of the 2008 Obama-Biden Transition Team‚Äôs efforts to facilitate clean energy development. A similar concept was adopted as an amendment to the federal cap and trade bill, called the American Clean Energy and Security Act, introduced in May 2009.Climate Progress. \\"What is the Clean Energy Bank and Why Is It In Waxman-Markey?‚Äù A companion piece of federal green financing legislation was simultaneously introduced in the Senate, where it received broad bipartisan support.Mcgowan, Elizabeth. \\"Clean Energy Investment Bank Has Bipartisan Support, But No Money\\" When the 2009 cap and trade legislation ultimately failed to pass the Senate, green bank advocates in the US focused on the state level. Connecticut established the first state green bank in 2011, followed by New York in 2013. By the end of fiscal year 2015, the Connecticut Green Bank had supported $663 million in project investments. In the UK in 2009, two reports were published advocating the creation of a state-backed infrastructure bank to provide financing to green projects. The first, entitled \\"Accelerating Green Infrastructure Financing: Outline proposals for UK green bonds and infrastructure bank\\" was published in March 2009 by Climate Change Capital and E3G. The second, entitled \\"Delivering a 21st Century Infrastructure for Britain\\" was published by Policy Exchange in September 2009 and was written by Dieter Helm, James Wardlaw and Ben Caldecott. Essential elements There are many types and styles of institutions that finance clean energy and green infrastructure projects. There are several key elements that distinguish green banks from other financing institutions: a focus on commercially viable technologies, a dedicated source of capital, a focus on leveraging private investment, and a relationship with government. Green banks focus on commercially viable technologies, as opposed to early-stage innovative technologies, because they have been tested, have less associated ‚Äútechnology risk‚Äù and can reliably produce revenue for project owners.Kennan, Hallie. \\"Working Paper: State Green Banks for Clean Energy\\" Green banks are public-purpose entities with some manner of a relationship with government, and are usually capitalized by public dollars. Just like a commercial bank, green banks lend capital and own debt, so it is important they have their own balance sheet. Green banks also focus on using their capital to facilitate private entry into the clean energy market‚Äîspecifically by using limited public dollars to leverage private investment in clean energy.  Market barriers  For consumers, high upfront costs often make clean energy technology unattractive to adopt despite declines in clean energy technology costs.Carol Browner, Danielle Baussan, Ben Bovarnick, Mari Hernandez, Matt Kasper. \\"Clean Energy Investment in the United States Historically, the clean energy sector has depended on taxpayer-funded grants, rebates, tax credits, and other subsidies to drive market development.Ken Berlin, Reed Hundt, Marko Muro, and Devashree Saha. \\"State Clean Energy Banks: New Investment Facilities for Clean Energy Deployment\\" Ideally, private lenders would provide financing to building-owners to cover upfront cost of clean energy adoption (beyond what is covered by rebates). However, there are capital market inefficiencies and inherent challenges to financing clean energy that have resulted in inadequate investment by private lenders. Some private lenders do offer financing for clean energy projects, but typically charge interest rates that are relatively high and loan tenors that are short.Clean Energy States Alliance. \\"Developing an Effective State Clean Energy Program: Clean Energy Loans\\" Such terms make financing a clean energy project unattractive from the end-user's perspective. To be attractive from the end-user's perspective, financing terms would be such that the monthly cash flow from clean energy projects would be greater than the monthly payments for the cost of financing. This kind of cash flow structure is only possible with loan terms that match the expected lifetime of the projects savings, and with rates that are commensurate with the risk. Therefore, private capital offered at unfavorable terms (if it is available at all) undercuts the economic attractiveness of the project potential customers or project developers. A shortfall of private financing exists for several reasons. One reason is that there is a relatively short track record for clean energy financing, and therefore there is little data for lenders to rely on.Griffin, Alfred. \\"NY Green Bank: Introduction to Standardization and Collaboration\\" Without data, and observable pipeline of similar projects, banks are left with high levels of uncertainty over how well different types of projects perform and how often borrowers repay their loans. This uncertainty leads to either hesitation to enter the market, high due diligence costs and/or unfavorable lending terms. Another reason for the financing gap is that many clean energy projects are small and distributed. Building efficiency upgrades and rooftop solar projects are inherently small investments that are geographically dispersed, with varying credit among counter parties. Heterogeneity in clean energy projects is more expensive for a private lender to underwrite at scale, making loans for clean energy projects potentially uneconomical from the perspective of the lender.Smith, Graham. \\"Responsible Marketplace Lending: Indispensable for Commercial Solar's Growth A third reason for the financing gap is the lack of capital market liquidity and maturity. If a commercial bank provides an energy efficiency loan, it is unknown to the bank if it will be able to sell that loan to another lender or if it will have to hold that loan on its balance sheet.Financing Solutions Working Group. \\"Accessing Secondary Markets As a Capital Source for Energy Efficiency Finance Programs: Program Design Considerations for Policymakers and Administrators\\" Mortgage and auto lenders don't have this difficulty, because there are highly liquid secondary markets for home and car loans, which helps keeps rates low. These kinds of secondary markets are just now forming for clean energy technologies. The final cause of private underinvestment relates to human and organizational behavior. To begin lending into a new market, a bank must hire new staff, learn about the risks and processes of a new market, and determine precise criteria for what kind of projects and credit ratings they are willing to lend to. This process may be time-consuming. Financing activities To combat these barriers to clean energy market development, green banks help consumers secure long-term, low- interest loans. Green banks harness a diverse set of financing techniques, including credit enhancements, co-investment, and securitization. =Credit enhancement = Green banks frequently utilize credit enhancements to leverage private investment. Loan loss reserves, overcollateralization and subordinated debt can help assuage concern among private lenders who are interested in entering the market, but concerned about the risks associated with developers, counter parties or technologies with less established history in their given jurisdiction. Credit enhancements also help lower the cost of capital for borrowers and improve debt ratings from credit agencies. =Co-investment= Sometimes green banks invest directly in clean energy projects to facilitate additional private investment or improve the financial terms set by private lenders. =Securitization= Securitizing clean energy loans makes lending far more attractive for private investors. Individual clean energy projects, which vary in credit, location, and technology, can be expensive for a bank to underwrite, and may not achieve the desired scale of investment. Bundling these loans into portfolios and selling them (or shares of them) diffuses risk and creates scale, attracting a broader group of private investors. A green bank can create and securitize portfolios of loans, allowing investors to purchase some portion of the green bank's debt on the secondary market. Green banks can also add credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization or loan loss reserves, to lower the creditors exposure to default risk and secure better ratings from credit rating agencies. Securitization provides greater liquidity in the market for clean energy project financing, which helps lower the cost of capital for borrowers. The Connecticut Green Bank executed one of the first such securitization deals, selling 75% of its $40 million PACE portfolio to Clean Fund, a specialty finance company. Financing structures Green banks‚Äô innovative financing techniques are more effective if they can operate through robust delivery mechanisms. Green banks can use these structures to increase the security of debt service payments and allow lenders to offer lower interest rates for clean energy financing. =Property assessed clean energy = Property assessed clean energy (PACE) financing allows consumers to pay energy upgrade loans through property taxes. The process places a lien on the property, and the property owner then repays the financing through PACE assessments on the property tax bill. This reduces the default risk associated with a loan and incentivizes private investment. Because the PACE structure reduces risk, it allows consumers to obtain lower interest rates on their loans. Because the loans are attached to the property, when property is sold, the new owners take over loan repayment. =On-bill financing= On-bill financing permits consumers to repay energy upgrade loans through utility bills. Similar to PACE financing, on-bill repayment affords lenders security in a developing market. Because electricity is a necessity, utility bills have a very high rate of repayment nationwide. Placing loan payments on a utility bill increases their chances of being repaid, appealing to private investors and facilitating affordable loans for consumers. Also, the on-bill structure enables renters to reap the benefits of added energy efficiency. Furthermore, the simplicity of on-bill financing is attractive‚Äîit is logical that tenants pay for the good they consume.  Market development activities  Sometimes the availability of clean energy financing products is not enough to stimulate the desired level of clean energy finance activity, and various non-finance market development activities are necessary as well. A green bank may design and execute various market development activities to build the market for clean energy. Market development activities may not directly involve lending, and a green bank may hire an outside organization to design and perform these activities. = Demand aggregation = Green banks or their partners can aggregate consumer demand for clean energy projects and financing to reduce customer acquisition costs for contractors and provide scale for investors.Reed Hundt. \\"Growing Clean Energy Markets Quickly with Green Bank Financing and Market Development\\" One means by which a green bank might aggregate demand is a neighborhood-wide group-buying deal. The Connecticut Green Bank and SolarizeCT have used this technique throughout Connecticut. = Contractor training = A green bank can organize contractor trainings, in which local clean energy technology installers, contractors, and developers learn about various green bank financing options. Contractor trainings allow contractors to use their knowledge of green bank financing products as a sales tool, increasing the size and volume of the projects they do. Ensuring that contractors fully understand green bank financing is a crucial means of getting that information to the end-users of the financing‚Äîbuilding owners. = REC financing = Innovative renewable energy credit (REC) financing plans have also helped green banks lower energy costs for consumers.Coalition for Green Capital. \\"Green Bank Product and Activity Overview\\" Green banks can agree to acquire and monetize the RECs that will be produced by a given clean energy project. After gaining possession of the RECs through the financing agreement, a green bank can then sell them to utilities. As a result of this activity, green banks can offer more favorable financing terms and utilities can obtain RECs in large volumes potentially at below market prices, reducing their cost of compliance and allowing them to pass savings on to their ratepayers. = Central clearinghouse = Green banks also operate as an interface between lenders and borrowers. Green banks can offer a central clearinghouse for all online data on energy resources (including rebates and financing), technical assistance for investors, and project coordination services for contractors. By facilitating transparency and accessibility of resources, green banks bridge the gap between supply of and demand for capital for clean energy projects. Organizational structure and placement A green bank can take many forms. Green banks can be newly created entities, or it can be created by repurposing an existing entity. A green bank can be a direct part of government, such as a subdivision of an existing agency. The New York Green Bank, for example, is a division of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). A green bank can also be a quasi-public instrumentality, such as a wholly owned non-profit public corporation. The Connecticut Green Bank, for example, is a quasi-public entity with both government officials and independent directors serving on its board.Connecticut Green Bank. \\"Comprehensive Annual Financial Report: Fiscal Year 2015\\" A green bank can also an independent non-profit entity administered by the government, either through a contract, or by purpose-building an entity to serve as green bank. The Montgomery County Green Bank, for example, is a non-profit organization that was purpose-built in accordance with legislation and serves as Montgomery County's green bank as a result of a resolution of the County Council. Sources of capital Green banks are usually seeded with public capital, and that capital can come from a wide variety of channels. The green bank finance model preserves limited supplies of public capital, allowing each dollar to be recycled continuously and utilized for multiple clean energy projects. =Ratepayer surcharge= A state or local government may place a small surcharge on energy bills within its jurisdiction, and may require that the funds raised by this charge be disbursed to a green bank. Or the government may repurpose an existing surcharge and direct the revenue to a green bank. The surcharge can provide green banks with a yearly influx of capital.Coalition for Green Capital. \\"Growing the Maryland Clean Energy Economy\\" The Connecticut Green Bank and New York Green Bank are capitalized in part by a systems benefit charge. =Bond issuance= Green banks can also issue bonds to obtain capital. Public sector bonds have the benefit of being tax exempt, allowing governments and other public authorities to pay relatively low interest rates to bond owners. A green bank's bonding authority allows debt investors to secure a steady stream of payments from an institution with a low risk of default. In exchange, the green bank receives capital that it can immediately invest in clean energy deployment. Types of bonds *Green banks can be capitalized by bond issuances that are backed by state in which the green bank exists.Schub, Jeff. \\"Bond Structures Typically Used By Green Banks\\" *Green banks can also be capitalized by issuing bonds that are backed by the green bank itself. *Green banks can raise capital by issuing project bonds that are backed by the revenue-generating potential of the projects they will fund. Revenue Bonds from a Dedicated Cash Stream *Other bonds backed by a dedicated cash stream (such as ratepayer fees, or by auctions of emissions allowances) can be issued to generate capital for a green bank. *If a green bank is short on capital, it can securitize loans it has issued (assets) and, through a secondary market, sell them to another investor as a bond. For example, the Connecticut Green Bank sold $30 million in bonds backed by commercial efficiency loans to Clean Fund.Lombardi, Nick. \\"In a Watershed Deal, Securitization Comes to Commercial Efficiency\\" *Industrial revenue bonds and private activity bonds can be issued for certain green bank activities. = Revenue from carbon pricing = Green banks can also be partially capitalized by the revenue raised from various carbon pricing policies such as carbon taxes, fees, and cap-and-trade systems. For example, both the NYGB and the CGB are capitalized in part by the revenue each state raises through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). =Direct budget appropriation= A government can allocate dollars to a green bank as a part of its regular budget and appropriations process. =Re-allocation of existing funds= Sometimes an existing investment fund will be underused or completely unused. It may be possible to re-allocate some such funds and put the dollars to work in a green bank. =Pension funds= Pension funds can invest in deals or portfolios of deals generated by green banks.Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \\"Green Investment Banks: Policy Perspectives\\" =Foundations= Foundations can make grants to green banks to fund startup costs, or they can make program-related investments in green banks and earn a return on their money in a way that is aligned with their mission. =Community development financial institutions= Community development financial institutions (CDFIs) can co-invest or provide startup capital for green banks. CDFIs can also provide important technical expertise in certain areas of green bank activity. =Federal sources in the US= *The USDA and its Rural Utilities Service (RUS) program provide funding for infrastructure projects, including energy-related infrastructure, to rural communities. The RUS has funding available that could be used by green banks to finance projects in rural areas. *The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has programs, notably the Loan Program Office (LPO), which provides federal dollars for innovative clean energy companies and project portfolios.U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office. \\"Federal Loan Guarantee Solicitation and Supplements for Renewable Energy Projects and Energy Efficiency Projects\\"* A green bank could take advantage of DOE money by building portfolios of projects designed to meet the standard set out by the LPO. *The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) which makes low-cost financing available for various water and energy infrastructure projects. Green banks can apply for access to these funds. Current green banks  =Connecticut Green Bank= The Connecticut Green Bank (CGB) was established in 2011 and was the first green bank in the United States. It is the most advanced green bank in the nation in terms of deal volume. Connecticut's legislature converted the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, a grant-focused promoter of clean energy investment, into a deployment financing entity. The CGB is quasi-public and its board of directors is composed of both government officials and independent directors.Connecticut Green Bank. \\"Bylaws: Pursuant to Section 16-245n of the Connecticut General Statutes\\" The CGB is continually capitalized by a systems benefit charge and revenue generated by Connecticut's participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) trading program. The bank also possesses the ability to issue its own bonds based on its balance sheet. In its first four years of existence, the CGB has stimulated $663.2 million of investment in clean energy projects, three- fourths of which came from the private sector. The increase in clean energy investment coincided with a huge decline in the number of taxpayer-funded clean energy grants. In effect, the CGB increased clean energy investment while reducing taxpayers‚Äô financial burden. =New York Green Bank= Governor Andrew Cuomo created the largest Green Bank in the nation, NY Green Bank (NYGB), and capitalized it through re-purposed ratepayer surcharges and revenues generated by the issuance of emissions permits.NYSERDA. \\"NY Green Bank Business Plan\\" The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) designed a 5-year capitalization structure with multiple infusions of capital summing to $1 billion. The NYGB is now a fully staffed entity and operates as a wholesale clean energy finance lender (as opposed to Connecticut, which operates more as a retail lender).Enerknol. \\"NY Green Bank Highlights Role of Innovation in Solar Financing\\" Rather than design specific financing products and programs, the NYGB relies on the market to learn what financing is needed. To date, the NYGB has received over $1 billion in proposals and has an active project pipeline of ~$500 million.NYSERDA. \\"Clean Energy Fund Information Supplement: Case 14-M-0094\\" The first set of NYGB investments were announced in the fall of 2015.NYSERDA. \\"Governor Cuomo Announces Three New York Green Bank Transactions to Improve Access to Clean Energy and Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions\\" The NYGB used $49 million of public capital to leverage $178 million in private capital, achieving a leverage ratio greater that 3:1. =California CLEEN Center= The California Lending for Energy and Environmental Needs Center operates as the state's green bank. The CLEEN center exists within the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. One of the center's major initiatives‚Äîthe Statewide Energy Efficiency Program (SWEEP)‚Äîfinances energy efficiency projects and upgrades for municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals.California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. \\"Criteria, Priorities, and Guidelines for the Selection of Projects for IBank Financing Under the California Lending for Energy and Environmental Needs Center Unlike the Connecticut and New York Green Banks, the CLEEN Center exclusively facilitates commercial projects and upgrades. Interested parties propose a project and apply for financial assistance with the CLEEN Center. CLEEN projects receive funding ranging from $500,000 to $30 million. =Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority= The Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority was created in 2014 to finance clean energy development in Hawaii. The first program to be adopted was the Green Energy Market Securitization (GEMS) program‚Äîan effort to provide the low-to-moderate income market with solar lease financing.State of Hawaii. \\"Status of the Green Infrastructure Authority's Activities: Report to the Governor and the Legislature of the State of Hawaii\\" For geographical reasons, electricity is more expensive in Hawaii than anywhere else in the United States. The advent of solar leasing has allowed many Hawaiian homeowners to install solar panels, but solar market penetration has hardly reached low- credit households. The cash flow positive financing generated by GEMS is designed to help low-to-moderate income Hawaiians enter a market from which they have historically been excluded. =Rhode Island= In 2015, state legislators converted the Rhode Island Clean Water Finance Agency (RICWFA) into the Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank (RIIB). The RIIB offers both residential and commercial PACE programs designed to reduce energy costs for consumers. The RIIB also created the Efficient Buildings Fund, a program used to provide low-cost financing for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in public buildings. =Montgomery County, MD= Montgomery County, Maryland is the only county in the U.S. that has created a local green bank.Devashree Saha and Mark Muro. \\"Green Banking Goes Local\\" The Montgomery County Green Bank (MCGB) was capitalized with $20 million from the settlement that accompanied the merger of utilities Pepco and Exelon.Thomas Heath and Aaron C. Davis. \\"DC Regulators green-light Pepco-Exelon Merger, creating largest utility in the nation\\" =Malaysia= Malaysia's Green Technology Financing Corporation was launched in 2010 as a component of the government's National Green Technology Policy. Through the Green Technology Financing Scheme, the corporation offers companies a 2% interest rate buy down and 60% guaranteed financing for green technology projects. =United Kingdom= In 2012, the UK government created the UK Green Investment Bank (GIB) to attract private funds for the financing of the private sector's investments related to environmental preservation and improvement. It is structured as a public limited company and is owned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). Its headquarters are in Edinburgh, where it is also registered, and it has a secondary office in London. The GIB works with a variety of technologies including energy efficiency, waste and bioenergy, offshore wind, and onshore renewables. UK's GIB has committed ¬£2.6 billion to 76 domestic infrastructure projects, mobilizing over ¬£10 billion of private investment.Green Investment Bank. \\"Summary of Transactions: Transactions to Date\\" In March 2016, the UK government announced that it planned to move the GIB to the private sector. The government plans to sell its shares in the GIB, but will seek to retain a ‚Äòspecial share‚Äô to ensure the continued protection of GIB's green purposes. =Australia= Australia's Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) was founded in 2012 with the purpose of mobilizing investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low emissions technologies. At the beginning of fiscal year 2016, the CEFC had invested $1.4 billion of its own capital and attracted $2.2 billion in private sector investment.Clean Energy Finance Corporation. \\"Annual Report 2014-2015\\" Green Bank Network The Green Bank Network is an international membership organization focusing on solutions to clean energy finance. It was launched at the 2015 COP21 meeting in Paris, by state and national Green Banks in Connecticut, Australia, Malaysia, New York, Japan and the United Kingdom, and the non-profits the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Coalition for Green Capital (CGC).

It was built in the 1640s by Governor Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, and it remained standing until it was destroyed in an earthquake in 1689. Built in the Baroque style, the ch√¢teau was regarded as one of the finest houses in the Caribbean. History Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, the French governor of St. Christopher and a knight of the Order of St. John, purchased an estate called La Fontaine for the sum of 110,000 livres in the early 1640s. The area was located on high ground overlooking the capital Basseterre, and de Poincy constructed the Ch√¢teau de la Montagne on this estate. The brick-makers, locksmiths, carpenters, stone-trimmers and limekiln builders involved in its construction had been brought from France. The estate was maintained by 100 servants and around 300 slaves. Over the years, the ch√¢teau was fortified with outer and inner walls as well as an arsenal. The original entrance which faced the palace was replaced by a heavily fortified entrance on the east side. The ch√¢teau was manned by a 50-man guard, and it was defended by bronze cannons. The ch√¢teau passed into the hands of the Order of St. John following de Poincy's death in 1660. It was probably destroyed in an earthquake in 1689. A few traces of the building, including a fountain and some red bricks, can still be seen today. Architecture 17th-century engraving showing a view of the Ch√¢teau de la Montagne (bottom) and a plan of Fort de la Madeleine in Guadeloupe (top) The Ch√¢teau de la Montagne was built in a mixture of the Roman and French Baroque styles, and it was regarded as one of the finest houses in the Caribbean. The palace itself was a three-storey building which stood on a terrace and was approached by a large courtyard. It had a lavish interior, displaying a number of paintings and maritime maps. It also had an extensive library, the oldest known in the Caribbean. The palace was fortified by walls and a ditch. There were a number of ancillary structures within the walls, including a church and quarters for de Poincy's workers and servants. The slaves' quarters were located outside the ditch. The ch√¢teau had its own water supply, and it was surrounded by extensive gardens full of exotic flowers and plants. The gardens were decorated by a number of fountains. Stables and a pigsty stood to the rear of the gardens.

Smith joined The New Republic in January 2015, part of a wave of new hires following the 2014 removal of editor-in-chief Franklin Foer, which prompted the departure of 55 staff members and contributors. Foer's replacement, Gabriel Snyder, hired Smith as a senior editor covering race, politics and gender. With the magazine facing criticism both from those upset by changes at the long-standing institution and also from those critical of the magazine's history, particularly its treatment of race-related topics, Smith described his role, with colleagues, as aiming \\"to help usher this magazine into a different era.\\" While at The New Republic, Smith also launched and hosted the magazine's first podcast, Intersection. In 2016, Smith became a senior national correspondent for MTV News, hired alongside writers and editors including Ana Marie Cox, Jessica Hopper, Charles Aaron, Meredith Graves, Doreen St. F√©lix and Ira Madison III as part of a significant expansion of MTV News programming. Among other on-air appearances for MTV, Smith served as a co-host, with Charlamagne Tha God, Marc Lamont Hill and Franchesca Ramsey, of the joint MTV-BET townhall \\"What Now\\", following the police shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile and the shooting of police officers in Dallas that all took place in the first week of July 2016. At MTV, Smith also hosted The Racket, a YouTube series on politics, especially the US Presidential campaign. He also appeared on the MTV News podcast The Stakes, including hosting an episode commemorating the 25th anniversary of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. After layoffs at MTV News in June 2017, Smith became a freelance reporter and opinion writer, writing (among other works) \\"The Revolutionary Power of Black Panther,\\" the cover story for Time magazine‚Äôs February 19, 2018 issue; this made Black Panther the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to be featured on Time's cover. In his analysis, Smith argued the film was culturally significant as proof that African-American narratives can be commercial successes with all audiences, as well as that \\"making movies about black lives is part of showing that they matter.\\" Smith joined Rolling Stone as senior writer in March 2018. In addition to his regular columns, Smith has profiled, among others, U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harrisand interviewed Rep. John Lewis, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. Smith contributed an essay entitled \\"She Can't Breathe\\" to the anti-rape anthology Believe Me: How Trusting Women Can Change the World, published in January 2020 by Seal Press.  Honors  While a segment producer at NFL Films, Smith was part of teams that won the 2006 and 2009 Outstanding Studio Show ‚Äì Weekly Sports Emmy for Inside the NFL and the 2010 Outstanding Edited Sports Series/Anthology Sports Emmy for Hard Knocks: Training Camp With The Cincinnati Bengals. Smith has repeatedly been named to The Root 100 list of leading black influencers, including in 2011 for his work on The Rachel Maddow Show, in 2013 for his work on Melissa Harris- Perry, and in 2015 for his work at The New Republic, where, The Root wrote, he \\"hits on cultural touch points from campus rape to the Rev. Al Sharpton, banging out a nice mix of opinion, headlines and original reporting.\\" For his Time cover story on Black Panther, Smith received the Arts Reporting award in May of 2019 from the Deadline Club, the New York City chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. According to the judges' comments, ‚ÄúJamil Smith‚Äôs TIME cover story ‚ÄòA Hero Rises‚Äô managed to approach an extremely well-covered topic from a fresh angle and in an intimate voice. Smith employed unique use of the first-person voice (and even the second-person ‚Äúyou‚Äù) to bring in his own perspective while also addressing the reader. And he placed ‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù in both current and historical political perspective. Wakanda forever!‚Äù  Personal life  In 2017, Smith moved from Brooklyn, New York, to Los Angeles, California.

Guggenheim Museum in New York as part of the Thannhauser Collection. The painting portrays model Lise Tr√©hot, who posed for Renoir in over twenty paintings during the years 1866 to 1872.  Context  Lise Tr√©hot, model for Woman with Parakeet, in 1864 Though the painting's date of creation has been a subject of debate, it is now agreed that Woman with Parakeet was created after Renoir returned from serving in the Franco-Prussian War, and likely after the events of the Paris Commune in 1871. Previous publications dated the painting to 1865. In 1912, in a letter to Joseph Durand-Ruel, Renoir identified the painting as an image of Lise Tr√©hot created \\"no later than 1871.\\" Woman with Parakeet was never exhibited in the Paris Salon. In 1871, the year the work was painted, there was no Salon Exhibition due to the Franco-Prussian War. In 1872, Renoir's submission Parisian Women in Algerian Costume was rejected.  Subject  √âdouard Manet's Young Lady in 1866, a contemporary painting of similar subject manner Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Lise in a White Shawl, another portrait of Tr√©hot in what is likely the same dress Woman with Parakeet is believed to be one of the final paintings depicting Renoir's close companion Lise Tr√©hot before the model ended her relationship with Renoir and married the architect Georges Bri√®re de L'Isle. Lise's black taffeta dress with white cuffs and a red sash is likely the same dress worn by the model in Lise in a White Shawl. The room depicted in the painting displays typical interior design of the Third Republic, characterized by dark heavy colors and greenery. Throughout the history of art, countless images of women with birds have foregrounded the intimacy and emotional bond between human and animal. The subject of a woman with a parrot or parakeet was particularly common in paintings during this period of time. In many cases, this imagery is symbolic in nature, at times referencing the woman as vacuous and mimicking others, or carrying erotic connotations that relate the caged bird to the caged woman. This subject matter previously appeared in works by artists Gustave Courbet and √âdouard Manet. In Woman with Parakeet, however, the analogy between the woman and her pet bird is comparatively understated. The rich yet stifling interior restricts the model's space, like that of the parakeet when confined to its gilded cage. The model's elaborate, ruffled dress and its bright red \\"plumage\\" resonate visually with the bird's own brightly colored feathers. The parakeet might also be characterized as playing the traditional role of confidant to the woman. Unlike the other artists, Renoir's subject is placed in a realistically modern setting and his model is unpretentious in her looks and dress. This work is considered an early work of Impressionism, characterized by the broad, loosely-handled painting technique.  Provenance  Since 1978, Woman with Parakeet has been in the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and has been on semi-permanent view in the museum's Thannhauser Gallery. The painting was donated to the museum by collector-dealer Justin K. Thannhauser and exists as part of the Thannhauser Collection. Ambroise Vollard, an art dealer and personal friend of Renoir, was likely the first possessor of the painting. After a succession of subsequent owners, Woman with Parakeet was acquired by the Galerien Thannhauser (Justin K. Thannhauser, proprietor) in 1927.

He serves as chief professor of Radiological Science at Perlman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Udupa has worked in the fields of medical image science, image processing, and physics analysis of medical imaging and medical diagnostic procedures since the 1980s. He is known for his contributions in image processing and its applications in various fields of science, medicine, and engineering.  Early life  Udupa received his bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications at Mysore University in Mysore, India and his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India. Career From 1982-1991 he served as Director, Medical Image Processing Group, Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania. From 1991-2016 he served as Chief, Medical Imaging Section, Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania. =3D visualization technology= Udupa was the first to bring 3D visualization technology to medical imaging. He implemented an early version of the DISPLAY82 software on an Independent Physician Display Console (IPDC) of General Electric (GE) CT Scanners in 1979 and in 1980. This was the earliest attempt to bring to use 3D visualization via medical imaging scanner manufacturers. He played a major role in developing 3D82, 3D83, and 3D98 software, all designed to run on the GE IPDC. This had a major impact on medical 3D visualization. In 1984, almost all scanner manufacturers and a few other independent vendors entered this field. Udupa assisted vendors in developing 3D visualization, including Technicare, Thomson CGR, Multiplanar Diagnostic Imaging and Virtual Imaging. Udupa implemented an early version of DISPLAY82 at the Mayo Clinic Biodynamics Research Unit in 1980 and 1981. This effort triggered widespread use of 3D in Mayo for research and led to the development of ANALYZE, a package Mayo Clinic developed and commercialized. He designed and directed the development of 3DVIEWNIX software, that is data, machine, and application independent, for the visualization and analysis of data. = Medical Image Processing Group = Medical Image Processing Group (MIPG) is one of the oldest research groups and studies the processing, visualization, and analysis of medical images, and the medical and clinical applications of these computerized methods. It was formed in the Department of Computer Science of the State University of New York, in 1976 by Gabor Herman T. Udupa joined the group in 1978. The group moved to University of Pennsylvania, its current home, in 1981. Udupa became its director in 1991.

Giselbert's sister was Ermengarde, whose first husband was Gozelon, Count of Montaigu (and so she was grandmother of Lambert, Count of Montaigu and Clermont), and second husband was Fredelon of Esch, who practiced brigandage with Giselbert. Documents from 1083 relate how the church at St. Paul at Li√®ge possessed property at Nandrin near the castle of Clermont. Giselbert and Fredelon terrorized the region so that the inhabitants could not do basic tasks for survival, such as gathering wood or tilling the soil. Henri de Verdun, Bishop of Li√®ge, gave the advocacy of this land to the adjacent landowner, Conon, Count of Montaigu, and forced Giselbert and Fredelon to restore the damage they had wrought. Giselbert married a woman named Longarde, of unknown origins. They had no known children. Giselbert, his brother Herman, his wife Longarde and his aunt Ermengarde donated the church of Saint- Symphorien to the abbey of Cluny in 1091. By 1095, the castle of Clermont had become a menace to shipping on the Meuse, occupied by brigands, and Otbert, the new prince-bishop of Li√®ge, organized a siege of the castle. The siege lasted from 29 June to 9 August 1095 and ended unsuccessfully, partly because Godfrey of Bouillon and other nobles in the army refused to attack the castle owing to an unresolved dispute concerning the deposed abbot of Saint-Hubert. The fact that Lambert obtained the rights to the castle of Clermont and the countship is undisputed. Two theories abound as to the cause. The first is that Lambert married the daughter of Giselbert and obtained the title by marriage. The second is that the activities of the occupants of Clermont in 1095, Giselbert and Fredelon, who some regarded as brigandage, were perceived by these two as the legitimate levying of tolls on river traffic. A 1095 entry in the chronicle of Giles of Orval reveals that what Otbert's objective was accomplished by purchase. The acquisition of Clermont and its subsequent enfeoffment to his vassal Lambert was part of a consistent policy of purchase which also brought to the prince-bishop the important fortresses of Mirwart, Couvin and, Bouillon. This second theory is now regarded by scholars as the most likely. As for Giselbert, the best avenue of escape was then the crusade. Avoiding defeat in 1095, he apparently departed in the army of Godfrey of Bouillon, and later appearing as a member of the army of Godfrey's brother Baldwin in Cilicia in the winter of 1097, described as Giselbertus de Claro Monte. No further reference to Giselbert can be found, although a knight in Godfrey's army, Milo de Claro Monte, who appeared in 1099, may have been a relative or follower of Giselbert.

Enric Galwey i Garcia or, in Spanish, Enrique Galwey y Garc√≠a (1864 - 10 February 1931) was a Catalan painter, associated with the Olot school of landscape painting. Biography He was born in Barcelona. His father's family was of English descent. He began his studies at the Escola de la Llotja and, in 1885, went to Olot to perfect his technique with the landscape painter, Joaquim Vayreda. His first exhibition of watercolors in Barcelona came that same year.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado, In 1889, he decided that his paintings were a bit static and went to Paris to study the works of Rousseau, Corot, Millet and other members of the Barbizon school. His stay coincided with the first major Impressionist exhibition, which also had a significant influence on his style. When he returned in 1890, he held an exhibition at the Sala Par√©s, which received good critical reviews, and opened a workshop in central Barcelona. He continued to make frequent trips to Olot until Vayreda's death and, for the rest of his life, was a regular visitor to Valldemossa on Mallorca. His first showing at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts came in 1895 and he took second place there in 1897. Together with Modest Urgell and Llu√≠s Graner, he founded the \\"Societat Art√≠stica i Liter√†ria de Catalunya\\", a society of middle-class artists, writers and art collectors who were opposed to Modernisme.Brief biography @ the Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana. From 1900 to 1926, the society held annual exhibitions at the Sala Par√©s. He was also an active member of the Cercle Art√≠stic de Sant Lluc. He died in Barcelona.

The election coincided with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the House of Representatives, elections to the United States Senate and various state and local elections. The deadline for candidates to file for the August 2 primary election is April 19. Background Virgil Smith, Jr., a former member of the Michigan House of Representatives was elected to represent Michigan's 4th Senate District in 2010 and 2014. Smith was arrested on May 10, 2015, for allegedly shooting at his ex-wife's SUV, riddling it with bullets and totaling it and was charged with multiple felonies. Two days later, Smith was removed from all of his committee posts, his leadership post and removed from the Senate Democratic caucus. On February 11, 2016, Smith agreed to plead guilty to malicious destruction of personal property $20,000 or more. Per his plea agreement, Smith will serve 10 months in the Wayne County Jail, resign from the state Senate and serve five years of probation where he will not be allowed to hold public office. At his March 14, 2016, sentencing, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Lawrence Talon sentenced Smith but said it would be illegal for him to require Smith resign from office or not hold office during his probation. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said if Smith does not resign, her office would rescind Smith's plea agreement. At a hearing on March 28, 2016, Talon refused a request from the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office to rescind Smith's plea agreement and take the case to trial, seeing as he had yet resigned his Senate seat. Immediately after the hearing, Smith was taken into custody to begin serving his 10-month jail sentence. On March 31, 2016, Smith submitted his resignation to Michigan Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, effective April 12, 2016. When Smith's resignation became official, Gov. Rick Snyder called a special election to fill the remaining portion of the term, with the special primary and general elections to take place on August 2 and November 8, alongside Michigan's regularly scheduled primary and general elections.

The British Royal Navy captured her on 6 April 1800 and took her into service as HMS Florentina. She served in the Mediterranean until she returned to Britain in 1802 after the Treaty of Amiens. There the Admiralty had her laid-up in ordinary and she was sold in 1803. Spanish Navy service Santa Florentina was commissioned in March 1787 under the flag of CdE Francisco de Borja, and sailed to Cadiz for trials. In November 1787 she was under CdF Jos√© Zurita, ferrying troops from Barcelona to Palma de Mallorca, where she arrived on 10 January 1788. In 1789, under CfF Jos√© Ussel de Guimbarda, she transported Spanish consuls to Algeria and Tunisia, . Capture In April 1800, was on blockade duty at Cadiz as part of a squadron under Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth and including the 74-gun ships and , and the fireship . On 5 April the squadron sighted a Spanish convoy comprising thirteen merchant vessels and three accompanying frigates, and at once gave chase. Leviathan and Emerald eventually opened fire on the rigging of two Spanish frigates in order to disable them; shortly afterward, both Spanish frigates surrendered. Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen (Carmen or Carmine), Captain Don Fraquin Porcel, of 36 guns, 140 men, and 950 tons (bm), was sailing from Cadiz to Lima with a cargo of 1500 quintals of mercury, sundries of \\"Cards\\", and four 24-pounder guns stored for foreign service. She was newly coppered and had provisions for a four month voyage. She carried as a passenger Don Pedro Ynsencio Bejarano, Archbishop of Buenos Aires. Before she surrendered Carmen had 11 men killed and 16 wounded. Florentina, Lieutenant Manuel Novales, of 34 guns, 114 men, and 950 tons (bm), had been traveling from Cadiz to Lima with 1500 quintals of mercury and sundry \\"Cards\\", and five 24-pounder guns. Before she surrendered she suffered 12 killed and 10 wounded, including Norates and her second captains. On 7 April, the British sailed for Gibraltar with their prizes. On arrival they encountered Incendiary, which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own. In all, the small British squadron managed to capture nine merchant vessels and two frigates. The Royal Navy took both frigates into service. British Navy service Commander John Broughton, late of , was appointed to \\"the Florentia [sic] frigate, of 36 guns, now off Malta.\\"Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.80. In December Florentina was in company with the sloop and the gunvessel . On 5 December they captured the French polacre Union, bound from Alexandria to France with a cargo of rice and coffee. Two days later, the same three vessels captured the French brig Bon Pasteur Retrouve on the same route with rice, coffee, and sugar. Six days after that, the same three vessels captured the French brig Heureuse Clairon and her cargo of rice and coffee. On 8 January 1801 captured the French bombard St. Roche, which was carrying wine, liqueurs, ironware, Delfth cloth, and various other merchandise, from Marseilles to Alexandria. , Tigre, , , Florentina, and the schooner , were in sight and shared in the proceeds of the capture. In March 1801 Florentina was at the British landing at Abu Qir Bay. She is not among the vessels listed as having suffered casualties in the landing, but for his services, Broughton received a gold medal from Ottoman Sultan Selim.Official Catalogue and Guide (1891), n¬∞ 2617, p.277. Because Florentina served in the Navy's Egyptian campaign between 8 March 1801 and 2 September, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants. Broughton received promotion to post-captain on 3 August 1801.Gentleman's Magazine (1837), p.651. Fate Florentine [sic] arrived at Portsmouth on 28 May 1802 with dispatches from Malta. She sailed eastward on 11 June to be paid off.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 7, p.530. She arrived at Deptford on 17 June and was laid up.

It is an old truism that a writer who feels what he says will always arouse in some degree a corresponding feeling in others, and Mr. Lawson (being a poet) is a writer in whose work the emotional touch is rarely wanting when it is needed.\\"\\"The Book of the Week\\", The Chronicle, 5 April 1902, p22 In The Record (Emerald Hill) the reviewer was impressed with Lawson's characters: \\"Lawson's men are men of flesh and blood; his landscapes, skies, atmosphere, are vivid and real; his broad humour is racy of the soil. He has brought a strong, unconventional mind, and a gift of intense expression to a set of new conditions and an unknown land. And, for us, it is our own land.

It is known to host a super-Earth exoplanet that orbits within the habitable zone, discovered in 2016. Nomenclature and history Kepler Space Telescope search volume, in the context of the Milky Way Galaxy. Prior to Kepler observation, Kepler-1229 had the 2MASS catalogue number 2MASS J19495680+4659481. In the Kepler Input Catalog it has the designation of KIC 10027247, and when it was found to have a transiting planet candidate it was given the Kepler object of interest number of KOI-2418. Planetary candidates were detected around the star by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits pass in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth, although other phenomenon can also be responsible which is why the term planetary candidate is used. Following the acceptance of the discovery paper, the Kepler team provided an additional moniker for the system of \\"Kepler-1229\\". The discoverers referred to the star as Kepler-1229, which is the normal procedure for naming the exoplanets discovered by the spacecraft. Hence, this is the name used by the public to refer to the star and its planet. Candidate planets that are associated with stars studied by the Kepler Mission are assigned the designations \\".01\\" etc. after the star's name, in the order of discovery. If planet candidates are detected simultaneously, then the ordering follows the order of orbital periods from shortest to longest. Following these rules, there was only one candidate planet were detected, with an orbital period of 86.829 days. The designation b, derives from the order of discovery. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star, followed by the other lowercase letters of the alphabet. In the case of Kepler-1229, there was only one planet, so only the letter b is used. The name Kepler-1229 derives directly from the fact that the star is the catalogued 1,229th star discovered by Kepler to have confirmed planets. Stellar characteristics Kepler-1229 is a red dwarf star that is approximately 54% the mass of and 51% the radius of the Sun. It has a temperature of 3784 K and is roughly 3.72 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star is slightly poor in metals, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of about ‚Äì0.06, or about 87% of the amount of iron and other heavier metals found in the Sun. The star's luminosity is somewhat normal for a star like Kepler-1229, with a luminosity of around 4% of that of the solar luminosity. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 15.474. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Planetary system The only known planet transits the star; this means that the planet's orbit appear to cross in front of their star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Its inclination relative to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight it is, vary by less than one degree. This allows direct measurements of the planet's periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring the planet's transit of the star. Kepler-1229b is a super-Earth, likely rocky, with a radius of 1.4 , and it orbits well within the habitable zone. In terms of stellar flux, radius, and equilibrium temperature, Kepler-1229b is similar (or an analog in some terms) to the potentially habitable exoplanet Kepler-62f.

The coastline extends to Leverick Bay, along a stretch which is characterised by its mangroves. During an excursion in the 1970s, roughly 160 trees and large shrubs were identified in the area, including Eugenia sessiliflora. Commercial development A resort community, intended for the wealthy with multi-million dollar villas, is developing at Oil Nut Bay, led by American developer David Johnson and his company, Victor International. The firm was given the planning permission to build 400 villas, but decided on building 88 of them, set in 300 acres. A May 2016 article by Caribbean Journal announced that the resort is still expanding, focusing on the development of four to six bedroom villas. The development is being built with underground utilities and is powered by solar energy. The resort has a double helipad and luxury tennis courts.

Early life Cattaneo was born into a noble family at Sarzana, near Genoa, Italy. In 1581, he entered the Collegio di S Andrea of the Society of Jesus in Rome. He removed to Portugal in 1585 where he completed his training and was ordained in 1587. He sailed for the Portuguese colony of Goa, in India, on 1 April 1588, and, by 1589, became superior of the mission at Fishery Coast. Chinese mission Cattaneo joined Matteo Ricci in Shaoguan (formerly Shaozhou), Guangdong, in 1594, after first having spent a year in Macao. He had originally been headed for Japan but was redirected to Macao by the Society of Jesus' Visitor in the Indies, Alessandro Valignano. He accompanied Ricci on his first trip to Peking, arriving on 7 September 1598 in hopes of establishing a mission there, but failed to gain an imperial audience and left two months later. He returned to Nanking where he stayed until falling ill and leaving for Macao in 1603. He travelled to Malacca in 1604. Having returned to Macao, word spread, in 1606, that Cattaneo was plotting to lead a Portuguese invasion and install himself Emperor of China resulting in enslavement of the population. The rumour was sparked by a belief that a large fortification was under construction in Macao, a belief arising from the secretive method and large number of Japanese labourers employed in construction of St Paul's Cathedral. After a short period of intense conflict in which at least one Portuguese Jesuit, Francisco Martinez, died in imprisonment accused of spying for Cattaneo, the rumour was dispelled when Cattaneo hosted a Chinese military investigator on a tour of St Paul's College where only books and humble students were to be seen. Cattaneo was in Nanchang in 1606, then established the mission in Shanghai, living there from 1608 to 1610, and finally settling in Hangzhou in 1622 where in 1628 he was to become Nicolas Trigault's confessor. Chinese orthography On arrival in Macao, Cattaneo attended the Society of Jesus-operated school, established in 1572 and whose first principal had been Antonio Vaz, for Chinese studies. He was probably studying there when it was incorporated into the famed centre of Chinese studies, St Paul's College, in 1594. He continued Chinese studies in Shaozhou. In 1598-99, Cattaneo collaborated with Ricci and Sebastian Fernandes on Ricci's second Chinese dictionary in a Western language. Ricci's first such dictionary had given no indication at all of the tones essential to meaning in Mandarin and it was Cattaneo who invented the system of five tone markings in this dictionary, now lost, known as Vocabulario sinico-europeo. Works Ling-hsing i-chu (Introduction of the soul to God) * Hui-tsui yao-chi (On contrition and sorrow for sin) * Shenhou pien * Memoria (1606) Death Cattaneo died in Hangzhou, China, on 19 January 1640, after a long period of paralysis, at the age of 79. Legacy Though the dictionary containing his invention was ultimately lost, Cattaneo's tonal system was used in one of the earliest Romanisation systems, that of Nicolas Trigault, in 1626, and adopted in 1656 by Martino Martini in his, the earliest surviving, Western grammar of Chinese. It appeared again in Michal Boym's 1667 translation of Kircher's China Illustrata and it was Cattaneo's work that formed the basis for √âtienne Fourmont's 1737 work, Linguae Sinarum mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatical duplex patine et cum characteribus Sinensium. Cattaneo was a capable musician and taught Diego de Pantoja clavichord in Nanjing. Pantoja, on orders of Emperor Wanli, subsequently passed on this skill to four eunuchs who were the first members of the imperial court to learn Western music. The Via Lazzaro Cattaneo, Dragona, Vitinia, near Rome is named for him.
