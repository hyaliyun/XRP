The tribe gave its name to the famous valley in Najd or specifically the town of Wadi al-Dawasir (The Valley of Al-Dawasir) which had a population of 106,152 in 2010 and is divided into two main neighborhoods: al-Nawaima and al- Khamaseen, and spread in various parts of the Middle East. Nomenclature There are various theories surrounding the definition and origin of the term Dawasir, the two most popular ones being that it was derived from either the name of the tribe's purported forebear Dosser or the eponymous Arabic word which translates to \\"soldiers\\". Other sources include other terms such as the Arabic word for Lion or a type of Arabian horse. History=Bahrain The Dawasir migrated to Bahrain in 1845 from Zakhnuniya Island, south of UqairGazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia by J.G. Lorimer. Volume 6, Historical Section: Qatar and mainly settled in and around Zallaq and Budaiya. American author Yitzhak Nakash, a prominent expert on the history of Shiism,http://fora.tv/2006/03/30/Shi_a_in_the_Modern_Arab_World described the tribe in his book Reaching for Power: The Shi'a in the Modern Arab World as being the \\"second largest and most powerful tribe after the Utub [in Bahrain]. So powerful were the Dawasir that their members recognized Sheikh 'Isa Al Khalifa as ruler in name only and considered themselves immune from taxation.\\" Members of the tribe worked in the pearl industry and opposed the overthrow of Sheikh Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa. Virtually all members of the tribe left Bahrain for Dammam after suspecting that the new ruler, Sheikh Hamad ibn Isa would attempt to tighten his control over them with British support and force them into submitting to his rule in 1923. The Dawasir were officially allowed to return in April 1927 by Sheikh Hamad after being requested by Ibn Saud to do so.Reaching for Power: The Shi'a in the Modern Arab World. By Yitzhak Nakash, p57. Years after the deportation of the Dawasir, a number of Huwala families arrived in Bahrain from southern Iran (mainly from the village of Jah Kotah), claiming to be members of the Dumkooh clan.ŸäŸàÿ±ÿØ ÿ¨. ÿ¨.

The Gospel of Mark tells of the cure of a man named Bartimaeus healed by Jesus as he is leaving Jericho. The Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke include different versions of this story. Narrative development The earliest version is in the Gospel of Mark () which tells of the cure of a blind beggar named Bartimaeus (literally \\"Son of Timaeus\\"). He is one of the few recipients of healing whose names evangelists let us know. Theologian Oleg Molenko (Uryupin) attributes this detail to the fact that these people had been definitely saved and served the Church in their lifetime unlike those whose names evangelists did not disclose. For example, in another instance of a man who had been an invalid for 38 years who waited for the movement of the water in a pool in the Gospel of John () and whose name remains unknown, Jesus cures that sick person and warns him about the consequences in case he reverts to doing things that brought him to the condition of infirmity of which he's now restored (), as yet he might have had inclination towards sin. Unlike him, healed Bartimaeus follows Jesus immediately, which led the evangelist Mark to include his name in the narrative. Bartimaeus also teaches us a Jesus Prayer, \\"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\\", and, its result, an acquiring spiritual eyesight, the sign of which was his restored ability to see. Father Oleg Molenko, theologian, sermon \\"How can a blind person recover his sight through the name of Christ? (Russian: –ö–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–æ–∑—Ä–µ—Ç—å —Å–ª–µ–ø–æ–º—É —Å–∏–ª–æ–π –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∞?)\\", YouTube, minutes 18-20, Finland, September, 2017. As Jesus is leaving Jericho with his followers, Bartimaeus calls out: 'Son of David, have mercy on me!' and persists even though the crowd tries to silence him. Jesus has them bring the man to him and asks what he wants; he asks to be able to see again. Jesus tells him that his faith has cured him; he immediately regains his sight and follows Jesus. Apart from telling a miracle story that shows the power of Jesus, the author of the Gospel uses this story to advance a clearly theological purpose. It shows a character who understands who Jesus is and the proper way to respond to him - with faith. The beggar, on being called to Jesus, discards his cloak, symbolising the leaving behind of possessions. And the use of the title, 'Son of David' - the only occasion on which this is used in the Gospel of Mark - serves to identify Jesus as the Messiah.Stephen Ahearne-Kroll, The Psalms of Lament in Mark's Passion: Jesus' Davidic Suffering (Cambridge University Press, 2007) pages 138-140 The Gospel of Matthew has two unnamed blind men, sitting by the roadside; Jesus is 'moved by compassion' and touches their eyes. A version of the same story is told earlier in the narrative, when Jesus is preaching in Galilee. On this occasion, he asks the blind men if they believe he can cure them, and when they assure them they do, he commends their faith and touches their eyes, restoring their sight. He warns them to tell nobody of this, but they go and spread the news throughout the district. (Matthew 9:27-31) The Gospel of Luke handles the story in a different way; there is one unnamed blind man, and the author shifts the incident to take place as Jesus is approaching Jericho, so it can lead into the story of Zacchaeus.Luke Timothy Johnson, The Gospel of Luke (Liturgical Press, 1991) page 283. Son of David Vernon K. Robbins emphasizes that the healing of Bartimaeus is the last of Jesus‚Äô healings in Mark, and links Jesus‚Äô earlier teaching about the suffering and death of the Son of Man with his Son of David activity in Jerusalem.Jesus the Teacher: A Socio-Rhetorical Interpretation of Mark by Vernon K. Robbins 2009, . 41-43.Vernon K. Robbins, ‚ÄúThe Healing of the Blind Bartimaeus (10:46-52) in the Marcan Theology‚Äù , Journal of Biblical Literature 92 (1973), 224-243 The story blends the Markan emphasis on the disciples‚Äô 'blindness' - their inability to understand the nature of Jesus‚Äô messiahship - with the necessity of following Jesus into Jerusalem, where his suffering and death make him recognizable to Gentiles as Son of God (see Mark 15:39 where, at the crucifixion, the Roman centurion says \\"surely this man was son of God\\").Vernon K. Robbins, \\"The Reversed Contextualization of Psalm 22 in the Markan Crucifixion: A Socio-Rhetorical Analysis\\" (1992) Paula Fredriksen, who believes that titles such as \\"Son of David\\" were applied to Jesus only after the crucifixion and resurrection, argued that Mark and Matthew placed that healing with the proclamation \\"Son of David!\\" just before \\"Jesus' departure for Jerusalem, the long-foreshadowed site of his sufferings.\\"Fredriksen, From Jesus to Christ, p. 181. The title \\"Son of David\\" is a messianic name.\\"Reflections: The blind Bartimaeus: Mark 10:46-52,\\" October 24, 2009, The Manila Bulletin, The Manila Bulletin website , citing365 Days with the Lord, (St. Paul's, Makati City, Philippines) from St. Paul's website (dead link), accessed October 28, 2009.Barrie Wetherill, \\"Jesus cures blind Bartimaeus,\\" from The Life of Jesus Christ, found at EasyEnglish Bible study. Accessed October 28, 2009. Thus, Bartimaeus' exclamation was, according to Mark, the first public acknowledgement of the Christ, after St. Peter's private confession at Mark . Bartimaeus The naming of Bartimaeus is unusual in several respects: (a) the fact that a name is given at all, (b) the strange Semitic-Greek hybrid, with (c) an explicit translation \\"Son of Timaeus.\\" Some scholars see this as confirmation of a reference to a historical person;Vincent Taylor. The Gospel according to St. Mark. 1966 St. Martin's Press Inc. p 448. however, other scholars see a special significance of the story in the figurative reference to Plato's Timaeus who delivers Plato's most important cosmological and theological treatise, involving sight as the foundation of knowledge.

He moved permanently to British East Africa in 1908, where he later led the Livermore expedition, with the aid of A.P.de K.Fourie, that opened up the Ngorongoro Crater to European hunters. He held several world records for big game at various times, and killed over 1,000 rhinos in Kenya, most of them in the Makueni hunting ground, which the Government needed to get rid of, in order to give these lands for re-settlement of the Kamba people. Besides safaris and other control operations for the Kenya Game Department, in Makueni Hunter killed 996 alone, from 26 August 1944 to 31 October 1946. It turned out that those lands were useless for human settlement. In later years, he became concerned about the possible extinction of the wildlife he had so assiduously hunted, and spoke in favour of conservation. His writings were notable for betraying his colonialist attitude, although his writings similarly betrayed a genuine respect and affection for the locales and peoples that he interacted with. In 1918 he married Hilda Bunbury. They had 6 children, Doreen, Sheila, Lesley, Gordon, Dennis and David. His grandson Alex Hunter inherited his way of life and is a safari guide in Kenya. He was a friend and contemporary of Denys Finch Hatton, who was portrayed by Robert Redford in the movie Out of Africa. In his published writings Hunter wrote of his friend and fellow professional hunter, and the tragic circumstances of Hatton's death.

At the University of Wittenberg, where his father was professor of theology, he gave his attention mainly to philology and history, but out of respect to his father's wish he selected a theological subject for his master's dissertation, in which he opposed the Pietistic position. Subsequent study at Jena aroused his interest in church history. During travels undertaken at this time he formed the acquaintance of a number of influential anti-Pietistic theologians. In 1696 he began to lecture at Wittenberg on the origin of Deism and Pietism. After serving as superintendent at J√ºterbog (1698-1701) and Delitzsch (1701-07) and professor of theology at Wittenberg (1707‚Äì09), he became pastor of the Kreuzkirche and superintendent in Dresden. Here he remained the rest of his life. His practical duties here turned his attention more particularly to the needs of the Church. His orthodoxy did not prevent him from admitting the truth of the claims of the Pietists concerning the prevailing perfunctoriness of religious life, which he ascribed to the negligence of orthodox pastors. He at once took earnest measures to encourage a deeper spiritual life in the Church. He had already begun the publication of his Unschuldige Nachrichten von alten und neuen theologischen Sachen (Wittenberg and Leipzig, 1701 sqq.), the first theological periodical. The comprehensive scope and able management of the magazine gave it great importance. Through it L√∂scher became the leader of the orthodox party, as opposed to the Pietistic and naturalistic factions in the Lutheran Church, and the representative of scientific Lutheran theology. In opposition to the proposal that Pietism should be considered the best means of promoting the union of the Lutheran and the Reformed Churches (advocated at the time by the Prussian Government), L√∂scher published several works, including Ausf√ºhrliche Historia motuum zwischen den Evangelisch-Lutherischen und Reformierten (3 parts, Frankfort, 1707‚Äì08). In the course of a controversy with the Pietist Joachim Lange, L√∂scher defended orthodoxy in his Praenotiones et notiones theologicae (Wittenberg, 1708). However, his most comprehensive criticism of Pietism appeared in his magazine under the title Timotheus Verinus, in which work he held that the Pietists had a false conception of the relation between piety and religion and that their zeal for piety placed them in opposition to the doctrine of justification by faith. The work inspired a bitter reply from his Pietistic opponents, which called forth from L√∂scher his greatest work, Vollst√§ndiger Timotheus Verinus (2 parts, Wittenberg, 1718-22. Eng. transl., The Complete Timotheus Verinus 1998, Northwestern Publishing House). In this he discusses the origin and rapid development of Pietism and elaborates upon its evils. Nevertheless, he was unable to check the advance of Pietism or even to pass a true judgment upon the real significance of the movement. The importance of L√∂scher's part in the Pietistic controversy was not fully recognized until the return to Evangelical doctrine in the nineteenth century. L√∂scher took an active part also in the controversy which at that time was being waged against the Roman Catholic Church in Dresden and contributed a number of studies to that cause, notably his Vollst√§ndige Reformations-Akta und Documenta (3 vols., Leipzig, 1720‚Äì29). He also opposed Wolff's system of philosophy, claiming that \\"philosophical indifferentism\\" portended a revolution in Christianity.

It is a World Heritage site. The monastery is the largest in Italy. Its building history covers 450 years, but the principal parts of the buildings are in Baroque style. It is a very large monastery, comprising 51,500 m¬≤ (12.7 acres), with 320 rooms and halls. History Padula Charterhouse was founded by Tommaso di San Severino on 27 April 1306 on the site of an earlier monastery. It is dedicated to Saint Lawrence, and its architectural structure supposedly recalls the griddle-iron upon which the saint was burnt alive. Facade of the monastery The monastery has the biggest cloister in the world, covering 12,000 m¬≤ (2.97 acres) and surrounded by 84 columns. A famous spiral staircase of white marble inside an annex leads to the large library. According to the strict Carthusian distinction between contemplation and work, there are two distinct places for these practices: on the one hand the peaceful cloisters, the library with its fine Vietri ceramic tiled floor, the chapels decorated with fine inlaid marble works. The altar frontals in most of the chapels are inlaid, not with marble, but with some of the most spectacular 18th. century scagliola work ever created. This is the highest concentration of such work in one place. One of the centres of production was in Naples. the cloister orchards; and on the other hand the large kitchen, the cellars with their enormous wine vats, the laundries, and the huge external yards, where there were people working in the stables, ovens, stores, and at the olive oil mill. The yards were used for productive activities and for trade between the charterhouse and the external world. The monastery also houses the archaeological museum of Western Lucania, which preserves a collection of all the finds unearthed in the excavations at the necropolis of Sala Consilina and Padula. This museum represents a period of time ranging from protohistory to the Hellenistic Age. The building has also played a role in the military history of Italy. It served as French headquarters during the Napoleonic Wars, then as a base of Garibaldi's Southern Army during the Risorgimento, finally, as an internment camp for prisoners during the World War 1 and World War 2. It was here that the Czechoslovak Legion in Italy was established in 1917.

History  This technique has been attributed to Dr Robert Muller a Swiss dermatologist who started experimenting with this technique in the mid-fifties of the last century because he was unsatisfied with the results of sclerotherapy. Moreover, he wanted an alternative for the large eyecatching scars patients were left with after classical varicose vein surgery. After ten years of experience he demonstrated this technique during the annual meeting of the French Phlebology Society.Muller R. Traitement des varices par la phl√©bectomie ambulatoire. Bull Soc Fr Phl√©b 1966; 19: 277-9 Indications General accepted indications for this technique are side branch varicose veins (semicirculatory varicose veins), varicose veins of the foot, around the ankle and the knee pit. It has been successfully used in arm varicosities and peri-ocular veins (around the eyes). Technique The procedure involves the removal of the varicose veins through multiple small 2‚Äì3 mm incisions in the skin overlying the varicose veins. First the veins are marked with the patient in standing position. Then the patient is positioned on the operating table and local anesthesia is applied. Incisions are made using a surgical blade. The most important instrument for this technique is the vein retractor or phlebectomy hook. There are two ways by which the veins can be grasped. Into the vein itself with a sharp instrument or around the vein with a blunt instrument. The phlebectomy hook is inserted through an incision and the varicose veins is hooked, extracted, and subsequently fixed with a clamp (e.g. Mosquito clamp). Next the vein is pulled out by turning or ‚Äúwenching‚Äù the exteriorized part of the vein and moving the clamps as the vein is pulled out further. Dependent on the amount of varicose vein that has been removed the next incision is made 5 to 10 cm. along the pre-operative markings.  Results  The procedure may be performed with tumescent or local anesthesia, such as with lidocaine. It is called ambulatory phlebectomy because patients usually return to normal daily activity immediately after the procedure which therefore may be performed in hospital or outpatient settings. Ambulatory phlebectomy is considered to be more effective than sclerotherapy.  Post-operative care  Graded compression stockings are usually worn for 1‚Äì2 weeks after the procedure but compression bandages may also be used. This procedure is often used as an adjunct to endovenous laser treatment or other endovenous ablations of the greater saphenous vein.  Complications  Complications are uncommon, but include paresthesia, bruising, hemorrhage and hematoma.

Not Without My Husband is a memoir which describes her life with her Persian (Iranian) husband Massoud Harun-Mahdavi and two children in Iran. The book offers a direct view of the Iranian society as seen by a Westerner. Justine moved to Iran 1968 and lived with her husband Massoud Harun-Mahdavi and two children in different cities (mainly in Kerman, Mashhad and Tehran) for more than 11 years. Her husband Masoud was in different political positions. He was twice the mayor of the holy city of Mashhad. He also was once mayor of the capital city, Tehran. Due to his popularity among the people, he was even a member of the new government during the first months of the Islamic Republic. But he soon understood that the theocratic regime was not on path to bring democracy and freedom to the Iranian people. So Justine and her family left Iran in September 1979. Her husband is an active and well known member of the democratic Iranian opposition called Jebhe Melli. She visited Iran together with her daughter and son again in 2000.

It lies on the A38 road, south of Highbridge. The village is the principal settlement in the civil parish of West Huntspill, which also contains the hamlet of Alstone. The parish of West Huntspill has a population of 1,414. History The first mention of Huntspill is around 796 AD, when the area was granted to Glastonbury Abbey by Aethelmund, a nobleman under King Offa of Mercia. Huntspill was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Honspil, meaning 'Huna's Pill' (possibly from the Old English personal name Huna). The Welsh word P√Æl, is a common element along the Somerset coast denoting a tidal inlet suitable as a harbour. The parish of Huntspill was part of the Huntspill and Puriton Hundred, The mouth of the River Brue had an extensive harbour in Roman and Saxon times, before silting up in the medieval period. A new wharf, known as Clyce Wharf, was built on the Huntspill side of the river mouth by 1904, and was used for the import of coal and the export of bricks and tiles and agricultural products. The wharf closed in 1949. The village was flooded in the Bristol Channel floods of 1607. In 1936 the village was the centre of an outbreak of Typhoid fever in which seven people died. The ancient parish of Huntspill also included the villages of East Huntspill, Hackness and Bason Bridge, east of the village of Huntspill. The western boundary of the parish was the tidal River Parrett, but changes in the course of the river left some parts of the parish on the west side of the river until 1933, when they were transferred to the civil parish of Otterhampton. In 1885 the uninhabited Stert Island in Bridgwater Bay was transferred from the parish of Stogursey to Huntspill, but the island was also transferred to Otterhampton in 1933. In 1949 the civil parish of Huntspill was abolished and divided into the civil parishes of West Huntspill and Huntspill All Saints (renamed East Huntspill in 1972) along the line of the Bristol and Exeter Railway.Vision of Britain website Governance Aerial view of Huntspill and Alstone. The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village falls within the 'Huntspill and Pawlett' electoral ward. As is indicated by the name Pawlett is also included within the ward. The total population at the 2011 census was 2,171. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The Church of St Peter was established by 1208, rebuilt around 1400, and extended in the early to mid 15th century. It was gutted by fire in 1878 and restored over the next two years. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building.

They are dedicated to various aspects of the Christian faith and are considered of great beauty by virtue of the skill with which they have been integrated into the surrounding natural landscape of hills, forests and lakes. They also house important artistic material in the form of wall paintings and statuary. In 2003, they were named as a World Heritage Site. Model and characteristics  The model of the calvary or \\"holy mountain\\" is a Christian creation dating from the late fifteenth century, that during the Counter-Reformation spread from Italy to Europe and the New World. A calvary is a devotional complex standing on the slopes of a mountain, with a series of chapels or kiosks containing scenes from the life of Christ, the Virgin Mary or the Saints, in the form of painting or sculptures. As a re- evocation of the New Jerusalem, Sacred Mountains offered pilgrims an opportunity to visit the Holy Places by conjuring up, on a smaller scale, the buildings in which Christ's Passion took place. The Sacred Mountains stand on high ground, at some distance from the town centre, in a more natural setting. They are usually reached by pilgrimage. The itinerary leading up to the Sacred Mountain often re-evokes the Via Dolorosa, the road leading from Jerusalem to Calvary along which Christ carried the Cross. The nine The nine Sacri Monti included in the World Heritage Site are: #The Sacro Monte of Nuova Gerusalemme (New Jerusalem) of Varallo Sesia (1486), Varallo Sesia, province of Vercelli #The Sacro Monte of Santa Maria Assunta, Serralunga di Crea (1589), province of Alessandria #The Sacro Monte of San Francesco, Orta San Giulio (1590), province of Novara #The Sacro Monte of the Rosary, Varese (1598) #The Sacro Monte of the Blessed Virgin, Oropa (1617), province of Biella #The Sacro Monte of the Blessed Virgin of Succour, Ossuccio (1635), province of Como #The Sacro Monte of the Holy Trinity, Ghiffa (1591), province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola #The Sacro Monte and Calvary, Domodossola (1657), province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola #The Sacro Monte of Belmonte, Valperga (1712), Metropolitan City of Turin GFerrari salita-calvario Varallo.jpgSacro Monte di Varallo.

The unit executed actions against dissidents in Italy, Britain, Denmark, West Germany, Turkey, France, Ethiopia, Sweden, and Switzerland. Documents describing its activities were declassified in 2010. State Security played an active part in the so-called \\"Revival Process\\" to Bulgarianize the Bulgarian Turks in the 1980s, as well as writer and dissident Georgi Markov's 1978 murder on Waterloo Bridge in London known for the \\"Bulgarian umbrella\\" that was used. An issue the international community often raises is State Security's alleged control of the weapons, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, gold, silver, and antiques traffic through Bulgaria before 1989. It is popularly thought that organised crime in the country in the 1990s was set up by former State Security agents. The agency is often incriminated with the ill-famed murder of dissident writer Georgi Markov and was formerly accused of the 1981 attempt on Pope John Paul II's life. Bulgaria has always sharply criticized and denied the latter allegation. In a 2002 visit, the Pontiff cleared Bulgaria of any involvement. In 2018, declassified documents of the Communist Party revealed a plan to foment crisis between Turkey and Greece in 1971. The operation codenamed \\"Cross\\" and the plan was that Bulgarian secret agents would set fire on the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and make it look like the work of Turks. The declassified documents state that ‚ÄúAn intervention‚Äù in the religious entity would have ‚Äúsignificantly damage[d] Turkish-Greek relations and force[d] the United States to choose one side in the ensuing crisis,‚Äù. In addition, the Bulgarians also planned to boost the effect of its operation against Greece and Turkey by conducting ‚Äúactive measures\\" ‚Äúfor putting the enemy in a position of delusion.\\" The plan was developed by the 7th Department of the First Main Directorate of the DS, and was affirmed by Deputy Head of the Directorate on November 16, 1970, and approved by its Head. The operation was supposed to be prepared by the middle of 1971 and then executed, but it was abandoned.COMMUNIST BULGARIA‚ÄôS INTELLIGENCE PLOTTED GREECE ‚Äì TURKEY CONFLICT BY SETTING ON FIRE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE OF CONSTANTINOPLE, SECRET FILES REVEALReport: Communist-era Bulgaria plotted to burn Greek patriarchate  Legacy  The secret files of the DS have been a source of great controversy in the country. After the communist regime in the country collapsed, newly established democratic forces accused the former communist elite of secretly removing DS files that could compromise its members. In 2002, former Interior Minister Gen. Atanas Semerdzhiev was found guilty of razing 144,235 files from the DS archives. Others have accused the DS of infiltrating the young opposition. On 5 April 2007 Bulgarian parliament appointed a special Committee for disclosing the documents and announcing affiliation of Bulgarian citizens to the State Security and the intelligence services of the Bulgarian National Army (or ComDos). It began checking persons who once held or still hold public positions to establish any affiliation.

It was first broadcast on BBC2 on 13 September 1988. Written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, and directed by Ed Bye, this episode introduces the total immersion video game \\"Better Than Life\\", which features in both the first and second Red Dwarf novels. Plot A post pod for Red Dwarf finally reaches the ship three million years late and is brought on board by Holly. As the group check through it, Arnold Rimmer finds a letter addressed to him detailing that his father is dead. Despite knowing that he and rest of humanity are long dead, seeing the news in writing from his mother upsets him. Although Rimmer admits he loathed him due to his strict requirements for his kids to get into the space corps to make up for his own failure to join, he also points out that he looked up to him. Seeing him depressed, Dave Lister and the Cat invite him to join them within \\"Better Than Life\\" ‚Äì a total immersion virtual reality game that came within the post. Within the game, the group finds that makes their deepest desires come true ‚Äì Cat has Marilyn Monroe and an alternate version of mermaid (top half fish, bottom half woman) as girlfriends; Lister has wealth, eating caviar-covered vindaloo and playing golf; while Rimmer, with a physical form, leads an admiral's life with drinks, parties, and a wonderful wife.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 54. However, things start to go wrong when Rimmer sees his father in the game and is insulted by him, soon bringing out his feelings of inadequacy, and causing his neurotic mind to subconsciously reject the nice things happening to him, causing him to live a wrecked life with an unsympathetic Outland Revenue Collector threatening to harm him over a large debt he has. Rimmer's mind soon affects everyone else's fun, leaving them suffering anguish as well, before the game comes to an end. Once back on Red Dwarf, Rimmer is called out for his \\"messed up brain\\" and presumes his life will never be good. Almost suddenly, he finds a letter informing him he passed astro-navigation examination, but his joy is short-lived when he and the others find his tax collector suddenly turning up, revealing that they are still in the game. Production After looking back at the first series the writers, Grant and Naylor, realised that they needed to expand on Rimmer's background and explore his character. To achieve this the Rimmer family was written into the episode. There were his three high-flying brothers, his distant mother and psychotic father. His father appeared in the \\"Better Than Life\\" scenario, played by John Abineri. A dull cold day in Rhyl used for the sunny landscape of the 'Better Than Life' scenario For the first time since the series began, filming of several scenes took place on location. To film the \\"Better Than Life\\" scenarios the crew went to locations including a seaside landscape in Rhyl and Sacha's Hotel in Manchester. The same hotel would later hold science fiction conventions for Star Trek, Space: 1999 and Doctor Who.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 9. The seaside beach location caused a headache as it was dull and cold looking. One scene proved so problematic ‚Äì when they were meant to be sunbathing on the \\"paradise-like\\" beach, Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules could not stop shivering ‚Äì that the scenes were re-written and re-shot as on a golf course. Even the golf course scenes looked dull and cold looking, but director Ed Bye convinced the crew that it was okay and that the sunshine could be put in during the edit. However, it couldn't be made to look sunny and it wasn't until the episode was remastered that the sunshine was finally seen. Other \\"Better Than Life\\" appearances were made by Ron Pember, who played the Taxman, Debbie Ash as Marilyn Monroe and Judy Hawkins as Yvonne McGruder. Tony Hawks, who had appeared in the Red Dwarf I episode \\"Future Echoes\\". returned to the series to play the 'Better Than Life' game guide. Gordon Salkilld appeared as computer Gordon, the chess email gaming chum of Holly. Reception Originally broadcast on the British television channel BBC2 on 13 September 1988 in the 9:00 pm evening slot, the episode gained average viewing ratings. The episode may not have topped many fans' favourites lists,Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 10, December 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, but the story turned out to be very influential. Grant and Naylor used the plot for their first and second novels ‚Äì Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers ended on a cliffhanger when the crew entered the game and the majority of the second novel, Better Than Life, followed on from there.Red Dwarf II On Video, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 3, May 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, See also *Better Than Life ‚Äì the second Red Dwarf novel which expands on the total immersion video game theme. *Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers ‚Äì the first Red Dwarf novel which ends as the crew discover the game and enter it. *Simulated reality *Virtual reality addiction NotesReferencesExternal links Episode Guide - Series II at RedDwarf.co.uk Red Dwarf II episodes 1988 British television episodes Fictional video games Television episodes about virtual reality ","title":"Better Than Life (Red Dwarf episode)"},{"id":"6371426","text":"The World Carrot Museum is a website about the collection, preservation, interpretation and exhibition of objects relating to the carrot.

The house was built between 1830 and 1835, and inhabited from 1833 onwards, for Sir Robert Gore-Booth, 4th Baronet (1784‚Äì1835) by London architect Francis Goodwin. In 1876, Sir Robert left the house and surrounding estate to his son, Sir Henry Gore-Booth, 5th Baronet. Architecture Described as \\"austere in the extreme\\" Lissadell house is a Greek Revival style detached nine-bay, two- storey over basement mansion, the last one in this style to be built in Ireland. Constructed of Ballysadare limestone with finely jointed ashlar walling. An entrance front is on the north with a three-bay pedimented central projection, originally open to east and west to form porte-cochere. Prior to its sale in 2003 Lissadell was the only house in Ireland to retain its original Williams & Gibton furniture which was made especially for the house and designed to harmonise with Goodwin's architectural vision. Lissadell's was the first country house in Ireland to have an independent gas supply piped into the property.http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/2003/dec/06/lights- out-‚Äì-but-lissadell-sale-on/#sthash.KyHKoh1a.dpuf Location The house is on the south shore of Magherow peninsula in northern County Sligo over looking Drumcliff bay. It is in the townland of Lissadell South, the Barony of Carbury formerly the t√∫ath of Cairbre Drom Cliabh. The house takes its name from the Irish placename, Lios an Doill U√≠ D√°laigh or O'Dalys Court of the Blind, possibly referring to the O Daly school of poetry that existed here in the 13th century. History The estate was formed from land granted in the early 17th century to the Elizabethan soldier Sir Paul Gore for his services to the English crown during the Nine Years' War. The land was confiscated from ecclesiastical lands belonging to the monastery of Drumcliff and the Lords of √ì Conchobhair Sligigh and the √ì hAirt chiefs of the territory. The original seat of the estate was at Ardtermon Castle, a 17th-century fortified house several kilometres to the west. The present house replaced an earlier 13th century house closer to the shore which was demolished. The estate was once but now consists of less than , the immediate demesne of the house. The house was the childhood home of Irish revolutionary, Constance Gore-Booth, her sister the poet and suffragist, Eva Gore-Booth, and their siblings, Mabel Gore-Booth, Mordaunt Gore-Booth and Josslyn Gore-Booth. It was also the sometime holiday retreat of the world-renowned poet, William Butler Yeats. He made the house famous with the opening lines of his poem: > \\"In Memory of Eva Gore-Booth and Con Markiewicz\\" > > The light of evening, Lissadell, > Great windows open to the south, > Two girls in silk kimonos, both > Beautiful, one a gazelle. The estate was bought by the Cassidy-Walsh family in 2003 for an undisclosed sum. They initiated a program of restoration of the house. Controversies=The Clearance of Ballygilgan This controversy occurred just prior to the famine and concerned the clearance of a settlement on the Lissadell estate as part of the \\"improvement\\" of the estate by consolidation of small holdings into larger more viable farms through \\"assisted emigration\\". The issue was whether these people were forced to go or left by choice. The Lissadell Affair This controversy centred around the sacking of Gabrielle Gore-Booth by the then Solicitor General amid allegations of mismanagement of the estate, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the heir Michael was made a ward of court. It generated considerable public indignation when it was first told by English journalist Anne Robinson. Gabrielle's counter claim involved the illegal felling of estate timber. Calls for a public inquiry were followed by an investigation by RT√â‚Äôs current affairs programme Seven Days, re-examining the claim in respect of the timber, which had been dismissed as ‚Äòabsurd‚Äô. Judgment was delivered in April 1965 by Justice Davitt who summed up by saying \\"Neither Gabrielle or her mother or sister have any legal rights whatever to any say in the matter as to how Lissadell is to be managed. They have no legal right even to be at Lissadell. They have been allowed to remain there because of the belief that if Sir Michael Gore-Booth were under no disability it would be his wish permanently to extend the hospitality of his home to his mother and sisters. That belief may or may not be well founded. I do not consider it necessary to direct that felling of timber be discontinued\\". Sale in 2004 In 2003, the house was put up for sale by the then owner, Sir Josslyn Gore-Booth (a grand-nephew of the original Josslyn Gore-Booth), for ‚Ç¨3 million. The sale was controversial because, as well as being one of Ireland's finest houses, there are many historical associations with the house. It was the home of Constance Markievicz, associated with the poet W.B. Yeats and, because of its links to Markievicz and the 1916 Rising, it can be argued that the house is inextricably linked to the foundation of the state. Many, including Sir Josslyn himself, hoped that it would be purchased by the state stating \\"Suffice it to say I would welcome an interest on the part of the state\\". However, the then Fianna F√°il government under Bertie Ahern waived any interest in the estate, citing a cost report commissioned by Environment Minister Martin Cullen which suggested that the overall cost to the State of purchasing Lissadell and refurbishing it as a major visitor attraction would cost in the region of ‚Ç¨28 million, a figure which has been claimed to be inaccurate by many, including Sir Josslyn himself. The state also waived any interest in the auction of the contents of the house. A consortium was set up consisting of businessmen and politicians to buy the house in trust for the state; however, the house was eventually sold to a private couple, the prominent Dublin barristers Edward Walsh and Constance Cassidy, who began to restrict access through the estate shortly after, citing privacy and safety concerns. Access Dispute 2008 to 2013Background= Protests over the access through the estate began shortly after with sale the formation of a group called the 'Lissadell Action Group' who campaigned to have public rights of way through the estate confirmed. The protestors claimed that there had been free access through the estate for the previous hundred years and based their claim in part on a statement by Sir Jossylyn. In a 1987 interview recorded in the Lissadell Estate papers he said: \\"This sea drive, or Avenue, then turns inland through the woods to the west of the house, eventually curving round to the north entrance of the house. Today the Avenue is a favourite haunt of picnic and bathing parties but this is not a recent idea; the people of Sligo have been able to use this area for recreation since the beginning of this century.\\". This assertion glossed over that this part of Lissadell has been sold under the Land Acts and that Coillte (the Irish State Forestry Commission) owned the sea avenue and land either side of it. In 2007, during a visit to the house by then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern to open an art exhibition, protestors claimed that \\"were Countess Markievicz here, she would be protesting with them\\" to which he replied that \\"the state can't take over every great house in the country. Lissadell is clearly in very loving hands. The owners have done a wonderful job.\\"http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/News/Archives/2007/Taoiseach's_Speeches_Archive_2007/Speech_by_the_Taoiseach,_Mr_Bertie_Ahern_TD,_at_the_opening_of_the_Constance_Markievicz_Exhibition_in_Lissadell,_Sligo_on_Friday,_30_March,_2007_at_4_05_p_m_.html Sligo County Council had by 2008 received 40 submissions from citizens and sought legal advice on access to the land. On a motion put by Councillor Joe Leonard in December 2008, the council voted unanimously to preserve public rights of way that the council contended existed on the estate. This motion began the procedure to vary the County Development Plan to include the four roads through the estate. In response, the Walshes announced the house's closure on 8 January 2009 due to the dispute with Sligo County Council.Owners to close Lissadell House estate. RT√â News Report - 8 January 2009 =First Judgement= The owners instituted legal proceedings against the council claiming that there are no dedicated public rights of way over the estate and the council counterclaimed, asserting public rights of way over the four main avenues.Legal proceedings over Lissadell House, RT√â News Report - 14 January 2009 The owners indicated that they would not be reopening Lissadell if the council won the court action. In Ireland a right of way can be established if there has been a dedication by its owner to the public and secondly, if the public has accepted this dedication. In the absence of an express dedication, one must be inferred from the behaviour of the owner. General rights of way can also be asserted by use \\"since time immemorial\\". In order to infer whether a dedication existed, the case focussed on the erection and subsequent removal of a barrier in 1993 by Sir Jossylyn, apparently to keep out New Age Travellers. The High Court judge (McMahon J) decided on the fact that no objection was made by Sir Jossylyn to its subsequent removal by locals, that this showed that he regarded the rights of way as belonging to the public. The 58-day-long hearings ended in June 2010, with judgement upholding the councils claims over the avenues. Legal costs for both sides at this stage were estimated at ‚Ç¨6 million. The grounds remained closed. =Appeal= The Walsh-Cassidys then appealed to the Supreme Court of Ireland. They claimed that Justice McMahon had \\"made a fundamental error\\" in his ruling arguing that he \\"had erred in converting evidence about use since the 1950s of four routes in the 410-acre estate into an effective presumption about, and significant extension of, the law governing rights of way\\". The case hinged again on whether a dedication of right of way had been intended by the previous owners of Lissadell. This time the 1993 incident was interpreted to infer that Sir Jossylyn saw the avenue as his to block and only relented in the interest of public relations. The Supreme Court issued a 117-page judgement on 11 November 2013 that ruled in favour of the owners, excepting a public right of access along the beach. On 3 April 2014 the Supreme Court found that Sligo County Council must pay 75% of the costs of the appellants, estimated at 5.25 million, and all of its own costs for the 58 day legal battle. =Issues= The case has brought up the contested nature of property rights in a formerly colonised country, as well as the omission in the 2009 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act of any substantial changes to existing law on Rights of Way. The laws relating to rights of way mostly predate the foundation of the state, and therefore stem from the colonial era of British landlordism. Hence Irish public access laws remain some of the most restrictive in Europe.http://www.keepirelandopen.org/Keep_Ireland_Open_1.pdf That said it proved that a well fought case on the basis of strong law prevailed against the amateurism of Sligo Council In a broader sense the Lissadell case has been suggested as an example of a link between individualistic capitalism and property rights issues in post colonial countries where the system of law inherited from the coloniser is claimed by some not to be in harmony with what is asserted by some to be the inherited culture of the majority. This asserted disconnection is discussed in Raymond Crotty's 'When Histories Collide' in which the asserted failure of capitalist colonised economies such as Ireland to develop smoothly is explained in terms of \\"individualism was inappropriately imposed on communitarian societies where land remained the limiting factor. When the former colonies gained independence, the √©lites made sure not to overthrow the existing system but merely transferred to themselves the privileges that had formerly gone to the colonial √©lites. In Ireland and elsewhere the √©lites were primarily those who had managed to secure for themselves the titles to land.\\" In this analysis, Lissadell is a clash between the different conceptions of the nature of property ownership that exist within different regions of modern Ireland, specifically in this case what is asserted to be the greater individualism of the east, and what is asserted to be the more communitarian approach in the west.http://eprints.nuim.ie/4868/1/GK_Historical%20Geography.pdf Recognition of the implications of a precedent being set by the Lissadell case regarding these underlying issues was expressed by several of Sligo Council representatives while discussing the case, who stated \\"We are opening a can of worms here. 100 years ago there was a mass path across my land.\\" and \\"while it was Lissadell House today\\", \\"what about [the implications for] ordinary farmers in other places\\". The Supreme court ruling has also been criticised by advocates of open access to the countryside, including Mountaineering Ireland for \\"setting the bar too high\\" effectively making it impossible to assert right of way through long use, instead requiring dedication by the landowner, a position abandoned in most European jurisdictions, including England, as too onerous a proof. On the other hand, the Supreme court decision has been welcomed by the Irish farmers organisation the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association ICSMA. The President of the ICMSA, John Comer said that it was \\"a victory for common sense\\" and will help set landowners minds at ease. It has been noted that the reliance in the Lissadell case on old English common law precedents inherited by the state and the lack of reference to the Constitution of Ireland in both judgements, highlights the continued reliance of the courts of the Republic of Ireland on English law and precedent, and concomitant upholding of English style property rights, which may or may not be suited to the present situation in Ireland. Rights of way clashes have also occurred at Ashford castle in County Mayo in 2011.

The Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM) was a research institute at Ann Arbor, Michigan, founded in 1972. The institute contributed to the development of remote sensing, radar, and holography. ERIM grew out of a military and environmental research arm of the University of Michigan. A for-profit enterprise, ERIM International, split off from it in 1997. This was successively acquired by Veridian Corporation, by General Dynamics - moving to Ypsilanti - and in 2014 by MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA). Meanwhile, the remaining non-profit portion became the Altarum Institute in 2001. Part of Altarum was in 2006 merged into the Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI), conducting environmental and remote sensing research, while health systems research continues at Altarum Institute. History The Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM) began as Willow Run Laboratories in 1946, but was established as a private not for profit research institute when it formally separated from the University of Michigan in 1972.University of Michigan Engineering School: Former CoE Lab Endows New Professorship ERIM contributed to the development of remote sensing for environmental and military applications. Much of the laboratory's early history is not publicized because ERIM and its predecessor organizations were developing remote sensing and surveillance systems to collect military intelligence from aircraft and satellites.What's ERIM? Secretive Past, Automotive Future Willow Run Laboratories Prior to Willow Run Laboratories's establishment in 1946, with the Cold War just beginning, the War Department was concerned about keeping the U.S. in the forefront of applied science. University researchers newly returned from WWII service were anxious to use their expertise to address those concerns.History of the Michigan Tech Research Institute. At the University of Michigan's College of Engineering, Professors William Gould Dow and Emerson W. Conlon approached Wright-Patterson Air Force Base scientists with their proposal to conduct a large-scale research project. The project was designed to prove the feasibility of what would later be referred to as an antiballistic missile system. The proposal was accepted, called WIZARD, and it was this contract that gave birth to ERIM's first predecessor organization, the Michigan Aeronautical Research Center (MARC). During the Vietnam War, protesters at the University of Michigan forced the University to sever formal ties with Willow Run Laboratories. Research from ERIM provided technology for military surveillance, as well as information and models for better prediction and understanding of floods, fires, agricultural crops and remotely sensed information, including studies of the Bering Glacier. Key technologies ERIM became well known in the scientific community through a series of international conferences on remote sensing and geospatial information technologies, in the spirit of the first International Symposium on Remote Sensing of the Environment held in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1962. ERIM played key-roles in the development and implementation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), at the time, an entirely new concept of radar technology. Development of an optical processing system for SAR data led Emmett Leith, Adam Kozma and Juris Upatnieks to use the newly invented laser in conjunction with the holographic theories outlined by Dennis Gabor. Leith and Upatnieks developed a practical technique for wave-front recording and reconstruction using lasers, thereby making possible the field now known as holography. Holograms have since found a wide variety of applications. Corporate history In 1997, claiming an inability to compete with for-profit industry, President Peter Banks and ERIM's board of trustees spun off a for-profit subsidiary under the name ERIM International, Incorporated. Nearly all of ERIM's R&D; work and contracts moved to the for-profit entity, while the buildings, property, and a small fraction of personnel and contracts were retained by the not-for-profit ERIM. Banks and many board members allotted themselves high numbers of shares in the new for-profit venture, which were exercised for considerable sums when ERIM International, Inc. was sold to Veridian Corp. of Washington, D.C. in 1999. Veridian was later bought by General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems in 2003, and the heritage-ERIM part of the organization became its Michigan Research and Development Center (MRDC) and moved from Ann Arbor to nearby Ypsilanti. Proceeds from the sale of ERIM International were used by the not-for-profit ERIM to acquire Center for Electronic Commerce (CEC), another Ann Arbor not for profit in 1998. ERIM acquired Vector Research, Inc. (VRI) in 2001 to form the Altarum Institute,Vector Research Acquired by ERIM headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan. On October 1, 2006, Michigan Technological University purchased the Altarum Institute's Environmental and Emerging Technologies Division (EETD), which was mostly comprised by the heritage-ERIM portion of the Institute, to form the Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI). The Altarum Institute is a nonprofit now solely focused on health systems research, while the environmental and remote sensing research continues at MTRI.

It occurs in humid forests in Central Africa, where it is often heard, but seldom seen. It is a medium-sized black bird with a bare, pink head and upper neck. Little is known of its behaviour. Description The head and upper neck of an adult black guineafowl are unfeathered, revealing the pink skin. A crest of short downy feathers is on the forehead and crown, and the throat and lower neck have a scattering of downy feathers. The body and tail feathers are black with some paler speckled markings on the belly. Males have one to three spurs on their legs, while females either have none or a single short spur. Juveniles are similar, but have buff tips to the feathers on their upper parts, a speckled breast, and white belly. The beak is greenish grey and the legs greyish brown. Males are usually slightly larger than females and measure about in length, weighing about . The call is a monotonous high- pitched \\"kwee\\" repeated at the rate of two to three notes per second. The alarm call is an even shriller sound repeated more rapidly. Behaviour The black guineafowl has been little studied. It is usually found in pairs or small groups, and is a shy, elusive bird of the forest floor. It occurs in primary and secondary growth woodland, favouring parts with thick undergrowth, but sometimes venturing out onto adjacent cultivated lands. It feeds on invertebrates such as ants, termites, millipedes, and beetles, and also small frogs, seeds, berries, and shoots. The nesting habits of this species are not known, but the eggs are pale reddish-brown, sometimes shaded with yellow or purple. It may breed in the dry season or possibly at any time of year. Distribution and habitat The black guineafowl is native to West Central Africa south of the Sahara. Its range includes Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The extent of its range is estimated to be . It is found on the forest floor in primary and secondary tropical rainforest, especially with thick undergrowth, and in nearby cultivated croplands. Research Black guineafowl are resistant to various diseases that affect poultry, including Ehrlichia ruminantium, which causes heartwater, but the mechanism for this resistance is not currently known to researchers. The black guineafowl's genome includes a toll-like receptor (TLR1) which plays an important role in the bird's immune system. This gene has been studied and includes 2,115 nucleotides, encoding 705 amino acids. TLR1 is associated with infections caused by bacteria in both humans and mice, and this gene is of interest to researchers because genetic variation in it is associated with increased Gram-positive bacterial infections, organ failure, and death. Status The population trend for the black guineafowl seems to be downward, because it is hunted for food, possibly unsustainably, and may suffer from degradation of its habitat. However, it is quite common within its range and the IUCN lists it as being of least concern in its Red List of Threatened Species, as the rate of decline does not seem to justify the bird being placed in a more vulnerable category.

The strength of a strong acid is limited (\\"leveled\\") by the basicity of the solvent. Similarly the strength of a strong base is leveled by the acidity of the solvent. When a strong acid is dissolved in water, it reacts with it to form hydronium ion (H3O+).Zumdahl, S. S. ‚ÄúChemistry‚Äù Heath, 1986: Lexington, MA. ISBN 0-669--04529-2. An example of this would be the following reaction, where \\"HA\\" is the strong acid: :HA + H2O ‚Üí A‚àí \\\\+ H3O+ Any acid that is stronger than H3O+ reacts with H2O to form H3O+. Therefore, no acid stronger than H3O+ exists in H2O. For example, aqueous perchloric acid (HClO4), aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl) and aqueous nitric acid (HNO3) are all completely ionized, and are all equally strong acids. Similarly, when ammonia is the solvent, the strongest acid is ammonium (NH4+), thus HCl and a super acid exert the same acidifying effect. The same argument applies to bases. In water, OH‚àí is the strongest base. Thus, even though sodium amide (NaNH2) is an exceptional base (pKa of NH3 ~ 33), in water it is only as good as sodium hydroxide. On the other hand, NaNH2 is a far more basic reagent in ammonia than is NaOH. The pH range allowed by a particular solvent is called the acid- base discrimination window. Leveling and differentiating solvents Strong bases are leveling solvents for acids, weak bases are differentiating solvents for acids. In a leveling solvent, many acids are completely dissociated and are thus of the same strength. All acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved in strongly basic solvents owing to the greater affinity of strong bases for protons. This is called the leveling effect. In a differentiating solvent on the other hand, various acids dissociate to different degrees and thus have different strengths. For example, anhydrous acetic acid (CH3COOH) as solvent is a weaker proton acceptor than water. Strong aqueous acids such as hydrochloric acid and perchloric acid are only partly dissociated in anhydrous acetic acid and their strengths are unequal; in fact perchloric acid is about 5000 times stronger than hydrochloric acid in this solvent. A weakly basic solvent such as acetic acid has less tendency than a more strongly basic one such as water to accept a proton. Similarly a weakly acidic solvent has less tendency to donate protons than a strong acid. Because of the leveling effect of common solvents, studies on super acids are conducted in more differentiating solvents that are very weakly basic such as sulfur dioxide (liquefied) and SO2ClF. Types of solvent on the basis of proton interaction On the basis of proton interaction, solvents are of four types, (i) Protophilic solvents: Solvents which have greater tendency to accept protons, i.e., water, alcohol, liquid ammonia, etc. (ii) Protogenic solvents: Solvents which have the tendency to produce protons, i.e., water, liquid hydrogen chloride, glacial acetic acid, etc. (iii) Amphiprotic solvents: Solvents which act both as protophilic or protogenic, e.g., water, ammonia, ethyl alcohol, etc. (iv) Aprotic solvents: Solvents which neither donate nor accept protons, e.g., benzene, carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulphide, etc. HCl acts as an acid in H2O, a stronger acid in NH3, a weak acid in CH3COOH, neutral in C6H6 and a weak base in HF.

The EP was issued as a stop-gap release in between the albums Dare (1981) and Hysteria (1984). Released in the US, it was made available in Europe as an import. The original vinyl release of Fascination! contained six tracks, including two versions of their single \\"(Keep Feeling) Fascination\\" as well as \\"Mirror Man\\", both of which were hits in the UK and the U.S. Also included is \\"Hard Times\\", which was originally the B-side of their 1981 hit \\"Love Action\\" and also appears on the band's 1982 remix album Love and Dancing. The featured version of \\"I Love You Too Much\\" is an earlier version of the song that would later be released on the band's Hysteria album in 1984. The album was released as a digital download in 2008 with a bonus track, a dub version of \\"I Love You Too Much\\". A CD version was released as part of the \\"deluxe edition\\" release of Dare in 2012, Discogs Entry minus Hard Times, but with other extra tracks. In November 2015 a limited edition single-CD was released (only in Japan), with the same track list as the Dare \\"deluxe edition\\". Reception A contemporary review in Creem noted the lack of new material on Fascination!, stating: \\"The more anti-social soothsayers among the reviewers will point out not only that two of these cuts are respective vocal and instrumental versions of the same song, but also that only three cuts are 1983-vintage material per their copyright dates; one '82 and two '81 \\"leftovers\\" fill out the disc.\\" The review noted the lyrics on the album, \\"Fascination! [...] is all dance dance dance, with maybe a bit of thinking (about dancing) thrown in here and there. I can't find a single phrase worth quoting among all the lyrics, even when Phil Oakey's vokes are at their most drone-authoritative. If I could translate all of Human League's synthesizer squeeps and yowls and pocks into characters and syllables, you'd have the whole verbal freight of Fascination! right there. (Stick with Heaven 17 if you need more coherent word-politics in your muzik.)\\" The review concluded that \\"Don't fight the slick funk, as electrolux bands like the Human League will become more and more prominent as the long-cherished myth of the singular- performance rock \\"concert\\" breaks down, and fans are increasingly satisfied to get over with prerecorded, undeviatingly swift and sure riffs like these (Human League's the glossiest as they come).\\" Track listing References 1983 EPs Albums produced by Martin Rushent The Human League EPs Virgin Records EPs A&M; Records EPs ","title":"Fascination!"},{"id":"6371630","title":"Green Hackworth"},{"id":"6371632","text":"The white-breasted guineafowl (Agelastes meleagrides) is a medium-sized, up to 45 cm long, terrestrial bird of the guineafowl family.

He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and is the only player ever to play in every minute of three consecutive Rose Bowl games (1934‚Äì1936). Reynolds was an All-American tackle who played for Stanford from 1933 to 1935. After two years in the NFL, Reynolds went into the broadcasting business and became general manager of the 50,000-watt KMPC radio station. He formed a partnership with Gene Autry in 1952 and served as the president of Golden West Broadcasting. He was also a founder, co-owner and president of the California Angels Major League Baseball team from 1960‚Äì1975. Early years Reynolds was born and raised in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. He was a star athlete at Okmulgee High School before enrolling at Stanford University in 1932. Reynolds was a large man, standing tall and weighing between . At Stanford, Reynolds played for the varsity football team in the 1933, 1934 and 1935 seasons. In 1932, Reynolds played for Stanford's freshman football team. The team included Reynolds, Bobby Grayson, Monk Moscrip and Bones Hamilton, and came to be known as the \\"Vow Boys.\\" The 1932 Stanford varsity team was soundly defeated by the USC Trojans. After watching the defeat, the freshmen players got together and vowed that they would never lose to the Trojans. The Stanford team proceeded to beat USC three straight years from 1933‚Äì1935 ‚Äî making good on the vow. Stanford was the dominant team on the Pacific Coast, appearing in the New Year's Day Rose Bowl game in each of those three years. Reynolds established a record that has never been matched by playing in every minute of three consecutive Rose Bowl games. In each of those games, Reynold played all 60 minutes on offense and defense without substitution. Two years after Reynolds completed the feat, Los Angeles Times sports columnist Braven Dyer wrote: > \\"A young man arrived in town yesterday enjoying perhaps the most unique > distinction in the history of the Tournament of Roses football. He is the > only athlete who ever played through three consecutive Rose Bowl games > without substitution. His name is Bob Reynolds. You may recall him as > 'Horse' Reynolds. ‚Ä¶ Reynolds left the field that afternoon with no fanfare > or trumpets but on January 1, 1936, he set a record which may never be > equalled in this annual classic. He was never removed for a substitute > during any of the three games.\\" While playing at Stanford, Reynolds acquired the nickname, \\"The Horse.\\" While most observers assumed that the nickname was derived from Reynolds' size and strength, it was actually based on a prank directed at Reynolds during his freshman year at Stanford. When Reynolds left campus for a weekend, a group of classmates led a horse up the steps of the dormitory and into Reynolds' room. The horse remained in the room until Reynolds returned on Monday morning, by which time the horse had eaten through the drapes and all of Reynolds' notebooks and some of his textbooks. From that day forward, Reynolds was known as \\"The Horse.\\" He was a consensus All-American at the tackle position in 1934, receiving that designation from the Associated Press, International News Service (later merged into UPI), and the New York Sun. In 1935, he was again selected as a first-team All-American tackle by the New York Sun. The profile of Reynolds at the College Football Hall of Fame referred to Reynols as \\"the plow which dug deep furrows in enemy defenses,\\" and also noted that he \\"knocked people down like they were wooden statues.\\" Later years After \\"deciding he'd had enough football,\\" Reynolds moved to Texas and Oklahoma and worked in the oil business in 1936 and 1937. Reynolds had been drafted by the Green Bay Packers, but decided not to play professional football. In 1937, G.A. Richards, a millionaire radio station owner who also owned the Detroit Lions, invited Reynolds to come to Detroit to talk things over. Reynolds told Richards he had no interest in playing for the Lions, but noted that he did have an interest in working at Richards' Los Angeles radio station KMPC. Richards proposed a coin toss. If Richards called it right, Reynolds would play two years for the Lions and work at KMPC in the off-seasons. If Reynolds called it right, he would have the radio job without any obligation to play for the Lions. Richards won the coin toss, and Reynolds signed a double contract ‚Äî to play football for the Lions in the fall and to work for KMPC in the off-seasons. Reynolds played 20 games as a tackle for the Lions in 1937 and 1938. During the offseason in 1938, Reynolds joined the sales staff of Richards' Los Angeles radio station KMPC. In 1942, Reynolds was named vice president and general manager of KMPC. When Reynolds joined KMPC, it was a small 5,000-watt station. In 1947, KMPC received approval from the FCC to increase its broadcasting power to 50,000 watts, making it Southern California's most powerful independent radio station. In May 1951, G.A. Richards died leaving the station under the management of Reynolds and Loyd Sigmon ‚Äî the KMPC engineer who developed the traffic Sig Alert. Reyolds contacted Gene Autry and advised that he had the inside track to acquire the station and its valuable real estate holdings from Richards' widow.Holly George Warren, Public cowboy no. 1, p. 278 Autry and Reynolds acquired the station together and founded Golden West Broadcasting. Golden West eventually owned and operated KMPC radio and KTLA television in Los Angeles and KSFO in San Francisco. Reynolds served for many years as the president of Golden West Broadcasting. Reynolds also served two terms as the president of the Southern California Broadcasters Association. (Reynolds was no relation to the Bob Reynolds who served as sports director and Lions announcer for Detroit station WJR for many years.) In 1960, Reynolds and Autry founded the Major League Baseball expansion team the Los Angeles Angels. At the time that he and Autry received the franchise for the American League's new Los Angeles franchise, Reynolds described his transition to a \\"baseball man\\" and his long relationship with Autry: > \\"'My transformation into the town's No. 1 baseball fan,' he grinned, > 'occurred the minute we were given the franchise, and I found out I had a > little personal investment at stake.' ‚Ä¶ 'I'd known Gene for at least 15 > years, and we always hoped to own a radio station together,' explained Bob. > 'We satisfied that ambition with the acquisition of KMPC in 1952. Now we > have a baseball team, and we're out to make it the best.'\\" Reynolds served as president and co-owner of the Angels from the team's first season in 1961 until 1975. Reynolds stepped down as president of the Angels in 1975 and also sold his ownership interest in the team at that time. In 1961, Reynolds was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. At the time, Reynolds said, \\"A fellow has to be lucky to be so honored. My good fortune was being able to play on great teams with fellows like Monk Moscrip, Bones Hamilton, Bobby Grayson and the rest.\\" In August 1966, Reynolds was honored with a night in his honor at a California Angels ballgame. At the time, Los Angeles Times columnist John Hall wrote: > \\"The contributions and the accomplishments of the large man with the large > smile have too long been taken for granted.. As a partner of Gene Autry, it > is natural perhaps that his role would be overshadowed by the glamor of a > movie box office king. ‚Ä¶ But those closest to the scene will tell you it is > Reynolds who is the dynamo of the gang ...\\" Reynolds was also a co-owner, vice president and a director of the Los Angeles Rams football team from 1963 until 1972. In 1966, Reynolds led a group of five Rams owners, each representing 8.16% of the shares, in advocating the establishment of an NFL franchise playing at Anaheim Stadium in Orange County, California. The Rams would eventually move to Anaheim for the 1980 season. Reynolds also served for 16 years as a member of the University of California Board of Regents. He was also a member of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee. In 1972, Reynolds received the Distinguished American Award from the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame. Reynolds died in 1994 at age 79 in San Rafael, California. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and three sons, Chris, Dan and Kirk.

The aircraft was transporting eight passengers and two flight crew to Martinsville so they could attend the NASCAR event at Martinsville Speedway that afternoon. All ten people on board were killed; among them, members of the Hendrick family including John Hendrick, president of Hendrick Motorsports, and former Busch Series driver and owner Ricky Hendrick.The Martinsville Plane Crash, October 25, 2004. Accessed August 9, 2006.  Crash  The flight path taken by the plane The King Air took off from Concord, North Carolina, at 12 pm EST, carrying eight passengers and two flight crew. Among them were several key Hendrick Motorsports staff, including team president John Hendrick and his twin daughters, Kimberly and Jennifer Hendrick; Ricky Hendrick, son of Rick Hendrick; general manager Jeff Turner; and chief engine builder Randy Dorton. The other people on board were Joe Jackson, a DuPont executive; Scott Lathram, a pilot for driver Tony Stewart; and pilots Richard Tracy and Elizabeth Morrison. The plane was reported missing at 3:00 pm. Eventually 9-1-1 was called, and fire trucks and police cars patrolled the Virginia area during the race itself. Around midway through the race, a Civil Air Patrol search team patrolling the nearby Bull Mountain's peak found airplane wreckage on the summit. When removing the wreckage from the summit, response teams found the bodies of the Hendrick group at 11:05 pm. Everyone on board had been killed. A search by firefighters also discovered a scar on the mountain of moved dirt; the discovery proved that the airplane crashed on the side of the mountain and the explosion blew the wreckage and group upward. NASCAR received word of the plane crash halfway through the race at Martinsville. Jimmie Johnson, a Hendrick driver, won the race. Due to the circumstances, the usual victory lane celebration did not take place. Upon the conclusion of the race, NASCAR called all Hendrick personnel to its mobile operations trailer where details of the accident were disclosed to the team.Hendrick plane crashes en route to NASCAR race; 10 killed  Investigation  An investigation conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) followed soon after the crash.

Dianne Dorton claimed \\"conscious and intentional disregard\\" for the life of her husband, Randy Dorton, the head engine builder for Hendrick Motorsports. The lawsuit places partial blame on John Hendrick, the President of Hendrick Motorsports. Her claim is based on a conversation with her husband shortly before the crash, as well as a conversation between John Hendrick and pilot Richard Tracy.WCNC (2006) \\"Widow working to find out what happened in crash \\". Accessed August 11, 2006. Dorton called his wife the morning of the crash. He told his wife that they were supposed to fly in a helicopter but the helicopter was delayed due to bad weather, and that they were going to fly in a Hendrick Motorsports plane instead. Dorton waited in the Hendrick Hangar for over an hour. He called Dianne and told her he didn't think they would go, only to call back 47 minutes later to tell her \\"we're going\\". Pilot Richard Tracy allegedly suggested flying into Danville instead of Blue Ridge Airport, but Hendrick refused because Danville was further away and he didn't want to be late for the race. The grounded helicopter pilot witnessed the conversation and could be called to testify. In a separate lawsuit, Scott Lathram's widow Tracy claims that at least 27 other aircraft scratched plans to land at Blue Ridge Airport on October 24 due to bad weather. Lathram was a helicopter pilot for Tony Stewart.

Customs have varied over time and between different Christian denominations. Clothing worn during religious services In some Christian communities, the term \\"Sunday best\\" refers to the tradition of saving one's finest clothing for Sunday services. In some communities, churches served as the main social center for local residents. As such, dressing in fine clothing for religious services was often dictated by a need to project status and influence among peers. Many modern Christians reject this practice and instead encourage modest, respectful dress not only for Sunday worship, but in everyday life.\\"What Should We Wear to Worship?\\", Radically Christian, 27 May 2015. Some Christian holy days incorporate traditional clothing, such as the Easter bonnet. Christians' clothing has, however, evolved over time. In recent decades, some churches have encouraged a more informal dress code. Among the first to adopt this policy were the Calvary Chapel associated churches. Many clergy members, especially those in denominations and religious groups formed in the 20th century, have abandoned the traditional robes and vestments in favor of business casual clothing. This change was made to close the perceived gap between the clergy and laypersons. Some even wear jeans and other everyday casual wear if the members have chosen to dress casual as well. Though a small minority, Christian naturists take this one step further, and wear no clothing at all, which they see as \\"God's design\\". Some Christian traditions encourage or require adherents to don clothing of religious significance during church services, such as a headcovering. Headcoverings are often required of women attending services in many modern Anabaptist sects and some Eastern Orthodox communities. Some Catholic and non-denominational Christian women also choose to cover their heads for worship, a practice enjoined by Paul in the Bible (1 Corinthians 11).

A tetrad is the association of a pair of homologous chromosomes (4 sister chromatids) physically held together by at least one DNA crossover. This physical attachment allows for alignment and segregation of the homologous chromosomes in the first meiotic division.  Formation  The formation of a bivalent occurs during the first division of meiosis (in the pachynema stage of meiotic prophase 1). In most organisms, each replicated chromosome (composed of two identical sister chromatids) elicits formation of DNA double-strand breaks during the leptotene phase. These breaks are repaired by homologous recombination, that uses the homologous chromosome as a template for repair. The search for the homologous target, helped by numerous proteins collectively referred as the synaptonemal complex, cause the two homologs to pair, between the leptotene and the pachytene phases of meiosis I. Resolution of the DNA recombination intermediate into a crossover exchanges DNA segments between the two homologous chromosomes at a site called a chiasma (plural: chiasmata). This physical strand exchange and the cohesion between the sister chromatids along each chromosome ensure robust pairing of the homologs in diplotene phase. The structure, visible by microscopy, is called a bivalent.  Structure  A bivalent is the association of two replicated homologous chromosomes having exchanged DNA strand in at least one site called chiasmata. Each bivalent contains a minimum of one chiasma and rarely more than three. This limited number (much lower than the number of initiated DNA breaks) is due to crossover interference, a poorly understood phenomenon that limits the number of resolution of repair events into crossover in the vicinity of another pre-existing crossover outcome, thereby limiting the total number of crossovers per homologs pair.  Function  At the meiotic metaphase I, the cytoskeleton puts the bivalents under tension by pulling each homolog in opposite direction (contrary to mitotic division where the forces are exerted on each chromatid). The anchorage of the cytoskeleton to the chromosomes takes place at the centromere thanks to a protein complex called kinetochore. This tension results in the alignment of the bivalent at the center of the cell, the chiasmata and the distal cohesion of the sister chromatids being the anchor point sustaining the force exerted on the whole structure. Impressively, human female primary oocytes remains in this tension state for decades (from the establishment of the oocyte in metaphase I during embryonic development, to the ovulation event in adulthood that resume the meiotic division), highlighting the robustness of the chiasma and the cohesion that hold the bivalents together.

In 1968, saxophonist Lol Coxhill joined them, and the band's name was changed to Steve Miller's Delivery. In 1969, the band teamed up with blues singer Carol Grimes and bassist Roy Babbington replaced Monck. The resulting line-up recorded and released one album: Fools Meeting. Although Grimes wanted to appear as a band member, the record company released the album under \\"Carol Grimes and Delivery\\". In 1971, Pyle left the band to join Gong and was replaced by Laurie Allan (who also later joined Gong). Soon after that, the band broke up. Phil Miller went on to found Matching Mole with Robert Wyatt and Dave Sinclair, but a new Delivery line-up was assembled in the spring of 1972 consisting of the Miller brothers, Pyle and Richard Sinclair (bass and vocals), then Steve Miller's bandmate in Caravan. The band played a few live shows in August/September that year, but with Steve Miller being replaced by Dave Sinclair (from Matching Mole and Caravan), the band changed its name to Hatfield and the North. A final Delivery performance took place in November 1972 for the BBC's Radio One In Concert series, with an unusual line-up bringing together the Miller brothers, Pyle, Babbington, Coxhill and Sinclair, the latter on vocals only. Steve Miller went on to release two shared (rather than \\"duo\\") albums with Coxhill for Virgin's Caroline budget label in 1973/74. Roy Babbington, who had played with the Keith Tippett Group and Nucleus in 1971-73, went on to join Soft Machine from 1973-76. Laurie Allan rejoined Gong a couple of times, most notably appearing on 1973's Flying Teapot, and later Barbara Thompson's Paraphernalia.

The Lord Chamberlain's Office had control of theatres until 1968, including censorship of the production content as well as for logistical matters. In the 1980s, they were replaced by similar requirements applied by a local licensing authority. The original regulations were officially known as the Lord Chamberlain's Regulations, but as they were printed in every programme as \\"The Lord Chamberlain's Requirements\\", this became their accepted name. The requirements cover: # Leaving the theatre at the end of the performance. # Freedom of gangways and passages from obstruction. # Limitations on standees. # Operation of the safety curtain during each performance. Three of the requirements (leaving the theatre, freedom of the gangways and the operation of the safety curtain) were set to music by Donald Swann for the revue Fresh Airs and were later used as encores for the Flanders and Swann revue At the Drop of a Hat.

It is located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. 44 East 68th Street The Mansion at 44 East 68th Street was built in 1921 as the private residence of Colonel Michael Friedsam, the former president of the B. Altman and Company and one of the premier art collectors in America at that time. The five-story building fashioned in limestone was designed by Frederick Frost, with wrought ironwork by Samuel Yellin. Friedsam's collection contained numerous masterpieces by artists such as Vermeer, Rembrandt, Jan Van Eyck, and Botticelli. Many of the original architectural elements, including carved marble fireplaces, stained glass windows, and ornate woodwork, are still in place today creating a unique environment for learning. Mansion Upon Friedsam's death, his collection, valued at a whopping $10,000,000 (in 1931), was split between the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum. The house itself went to Friedsam's close friend, Benjamin Altman of B. Altman and Co., under the provision that it be used for educational purposes. At that time, Altman sold the building to the Dominican Sisters for $1. At first, the only staircase in the building was the main red staircase. However, in 1956, the chapel was destroyed by a fire which led to the Dominican Sisters taking many more safety precautions and building an extra black staircase on the opposite side of the building. The Library, which previously held part of Colonel Friedsam‚Äôs extensive art collection, has over 7,000 books with special art, literature, and classics collections. The library subscribes to more than 60 magazines and newspapers. The Science Lab was renovated over the summer of 2010, underwritten by the generosity of the Reunion Class of 1958 and the family of a beloved deceased alumna. Computers are readily available in the library, computer room and throughout the building for student use. Dominican Academy underwent a major renovation in the summers of 2017 and 2018 which included the addition of two full-sized classrooms, a reconfigured library commons and dedicated chapel space, and additional student and faculty spaces.

The road runs on to Lugton and the B706 enters the village from Beith and Burnhouse. History=The village The name, first recorded in 1260, may be derived from the Gaelic words Dun (a castle) and Luib (a bend). Therefore, it is the fortified hill by the bend in the river. The old local pronunciation was Dulop or Delap without an 'n' and this has led to suggestions of other origins.Paterson, Page 227Dobie, Page 126 The Coat of arms of Dunlop of Dunlop In the 1600s, Dunloppe had two fairs a year for the sale of dairy stock, one on the second Friday of May; and the other called Hallowday, on 12 November.Dobie, Page 39 The Estate was erected into the Barony of Dunlop in 1688.

Her stone cheese press was said to be preserved at 'The Hill' Farm in the 1860s, but the existing press is dated after her death. The cheese became World famous and created a cottage industry with cheese merchants from Kirktoun buying up the cheeses and taking them to Glasgow for sale. The cheese making used up excess fresh milk and the coming of the railways reduced the need for cheese manufacture. Dunlop cheeses are still made at Clerkland Farm (2010). Tam Giffen was reputed to be a warlock from the Dunlop Parish and many anecdotes are told of his marvellous doings in the 1860s.Paterson, Page 222 Tam could not get over the flood swollen Lugton Water so he just ....came through below it. On another occasion he was prevented from helping the Devil blow a man off the thatched roof he was repairing by the man uttering God save me and had to make do with blowing off the man's wig and bonnet; finally he once entered a blacksmith's house by flying down the chimney. Tam died in odd circumstances, supposedly being murdered by the fairies for giving away their secrets.Robertson, Pages 105 - 106. In 1791 Dunlop is recorded as having six masons, 12 weavers, three smiths, three shoemakers, four tailors and three inn-keepers; by 1874 the village had 10 shoemakers, eight masons, six weavers, six smiths, five wrights and one tailor, but no baker or flesher and the people's health was such that no surgeon was need or writer (lawyer).Dobie, Page 129 1823 saw 'Mackie's Mill', producing woolen blankets, being set up on the banks of the Glazert Water and by 1939 Mackie's Mill was producing carpet yarn and had also branched out to establish two more manufacturing sites. In 1849 a Mr. Wilson set up shop as a ham curer. By the 1930s this ham curing business had diversified, and branched out into Ireland and had factories in Barrhead and at Eglinton in Irvine; the original curing house, known as the 'Burnhouse' has been landscaped and transformed into a local park thanks to funding from the Barcapel Foundation, previously the Clement Wilson Foundation. Robert Howie and sons started a small meal-mill in 1857, and then established a sawmill. They moved closer to the railway, where they remained until recently (2010).Clan Dunlop Retrieved ; 2010-10-04 The railway finally came to Dunlop in 1871 and because of the improved connection with Glasgow the farmers were able to send their milk directly into Glasgow, resulting in the decline and finally the cessation of cheese making in Dunlop. The population of the village in 1871 was 380 and 357 in 1881,McMichael, Page 158 whilst the parish was 1,160 and 1,361 persons respectively.McMichael, Page 161 In 1876, the town had acquired a butcher, a baker, a branch of the Clydesdale Bank, as well as a Free Church (1845), but still no writer or doctor was needed. By the 1950s, Dunlop had a post office, four grocers, a baker, a newsagent, a hotel, and a public house. Below the church stands the bridge over the Black Burn that locally has the appellation the 'Tee Wal Burn' after a spring that flows out under this bridge. It is commonly thought that the 'Tea Well' water was so pure that the people went down there to get the water for their tea however it may be a Gaelic element related to the name for a place where the coffin bearers rested for the last time before heading up the hill to the cemetery. The 1860s OS maps show that a cottage, Bridgend, once stood close to the bridge.David Clement 'Dunlop Diary' December 2012 Dunlop's castles The Seal of Richard De Morville, Lord of Cunninghame and his Lady Avicia A tradition states that the De Ross first held Boarland or Dunlop hill (NS 4019 4940) as their seatPaterson, Page 226 and a well-fortified structure existed there, later their seat was moved to Corsehill in Stewarton. A Celtic hillfort may have existed here, as suggested by the etymology of the placename.Arch Ayr Wigton, Page 26 A view of Dunlop or Borland Hill from near the Church. This was the site of the De Ross family castle. In 1848 the Scottish Journal records that a number of years ago the foundation of a ruin of considerable extent was removed by the late proprietor.Arch Ayr Wigton, Pages 26 - 27 In 1853 Mr. Dobie recorded that There can still be traced the meiths (boundary line) of a building of considerable extent on the top of the Hill of Borland.Arch Ayr Wigton, Page 27 Mr. G. Howie, of Dunlop in 1856, stated that he remembered seeing a small portion of what was said to be one of the walls about 70 or 80 years ago. It was a sort of bank, quite crumbled down and overgrown with grass. Since then, the ruins of a building of considerable extent have been removed and the ground cultivated.Name Book On the southern side of the hill there are the remains of a wide ditch or fosse, locally known as the 'Cuckoo slide.'Hutchison, Pages 7 - 8. PatersonPaterson in 1866 states that the foundation of a ruin was removed some years ago by a late proprietor. Pont states that the ancient strong Dunlop Castle situated by the Clerkland Burn (NS 42737 49312) was protected by a moat or fosse of water and had 'goodly' orchards. SmithSmith, Page 84 records that the 'Airn Yett' of the old castle was still preserved and its details published (see Wikimedia). It was also called Hunt Hall because the Dunlops were huntsmen to the De Ross family (Paterson 1866). The whole estate was sometimes referred to as Hunt Hall. This castle was situated at the site of the present day Dunlop House. The De Ross family were vassalsMillar, Page 71 to the De Morvilles, Overlords of Cunninghame. The De Morvilles backed John Balliol's claim to the crown and forfeited their lands to the Boyds, and in 1570 the lands were held by the Cassillis family. In 1600 it is noted that David Dunlop of Hapland excambied his lands with Patrick Cunninghame for his portion of the lands of Borland. The native chiefs, although displaced from Boarland Hill do not appear to have been exiled, instead they established themselves at what is now Dunlop House.Dobie, Page 98 The name Boarland also survives in the names of Borlandhill, Over Borland, North Borland and Low Borland. The name Boarland could refer to the presence of wild boar,Dobie, Page 97 however a 'Boor' also meant a serf and Norman lords often apportioned lands near their castles for their servants.Bayne, Pages 10 - 16. The Borland or Bordland also meant the land that was granted to the feudal superior specifically to be used to furnish food for his castle or dwelling.Mackenzie, Page 29.McMichael, Page 85 There has been a modern-day military use of Dunlop Hill, for in the 20th- century, between the two World Wars, a Royal Observer Corps post composed of huts was built on top of the hill. The personnel tracked enemy aircraft movement up the Clyde towards Glasgow. Development of more sophisticated radar tracking techniques after World War 2 made the facility redundant. Up until the 1970s the UK Warning and Monitoring organisation operated a bunker on the hill top, the access door and ventilation louvres are still in place. The Dunlops of that Ilk Mrs. Frances Dunlop of Dunlop, Patron of Robert Burns. Daughter and sole heiress to Sir Thomas Wallace of Cragie. The first recorded Dunlop is William de Dunlop of 1260, followed by a supporter of Edward I, Neil Fitz-Robert de Dulap of 1306. His estates were forfeited due to his support for John Balliol, as were those of the De Rosses. The family regained their lands by the mid 15th. Century and by that time we have 'of that Ilk' replacing the Norman 'de'. Sir James Dunlop of that Ilk held the estate in 1596 and married Jean, daughter of Somerville of Cambusnethan, descended from Lord Somerville. This may go some way to explaining why the Somerville family came to purchase lands at Montgomery-Crivoch and Bollingshaw in the 1800s to establish the Kennox Estate. Francis Dunlop was a witness to the disposition of the Scottish Regalia in Edinburgh Castle after the Union of the Crowns. James Dunlop of 1634-1670 married Elizabeth, daughter of Cunninghame of Corsehill and was an outstanding leader of the covenanters. John Dunlop 1748-1784 married the daughter of Sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie. A map of Dunlop House and Hunt HallShe was the patron of Burns already referred to. John Dunlop Esq. MP was resident at Dunlop House in 1837 and Pigot describes it as one of Ayrshires' handsomest mansions, with the Ogrestone or Thurgatstane lying within its estate boundaries. The house was designed in 1831-34 by David Hamilton for Sir James Dunlop of Dunlop. The house is an unusual Scottish-Jacobean style, but the gate lodge is more typical of Hamilton, with strap work, classical and manorial features (Milligan). The last Baronet was Major Sir James Dunlop of 1839-1858 who died unmarried. The last of the Dunlops to be born at Dunlop were John (1904) and Alexander (1906) Houison Crawfurd. Mrs Houison Crawfurd is remembered for producing the first tubercular-free cattle in Ayrshire. The house was let to a number of tenants, the Henderson family of the Anchor Line being the most notable. In 1933 the house was sold to Ayrshire County Council as a home for ‚Äúmentally defective‚Äù (language used at the time) children. The Clerkland Burn rivulet runs past the Dunlop House mansion, forming the boundary between the parishes of Stewarton and Dunlop.Paterson, Page 227 =The Brechna Braes and Brackenheugh= The Brechna Braes area lies close to Dunlop and has been developed as the Templehouse Community Woodland to celebrate the 2000 Millennium. The Brackenheugh is a wooded slope overlooking Aiket Castle.

The rest of the Kirkland-Dunlop lands passed from the Abbots of Kilwinning to William Cunninghame of Aiket and remained with the Cunninghames until the latter half of the 17th century. The Earl of Eglinton held the right of patronage when it was abolished in 1875.Ayr Arch Wigton, Page 29 The tomb of Hans Hamilton and his wife at Dunlop Church, called the 'Picture House' by locals The entrance to the old manse at Kirklands The church (NS 40474 49414) was probably built in around 1766, however by 1834 it was dilapidated and demolition followed, resulting in the construction of the Dunlop parish church, opened in December 1835, that we see today. This took place under the ministry of Mathew Dickie,Ayr Arch Wigton, Page 33 who left to join the Free Church at Beith in 1843.Dobie, Page 127 Parts of the original building are in use as tomb stones. Barbara Gilmour, famous for introducing the production of Dunlop cheese, is buried in the churchyard. Major McAlester of Kennox, then a heritor, obtained the 1792 bell and Miss McAlester and Charles G. S. McAlester returned it to the Kirk Session in 1935 to honour the centenary of the present church. The Rev William Gebbie was the last minister to come into the parish under the old system of patronage, in this case that of the Earl of Eglinton. William was a fervent evangelist and the 'Dunlop Revival' shook the whole parish until the reverend was charged with heresy in the early 1860s. He remained as minister until 1883.Dunlop, Page 6 The old manse was sold and a new manse and offices were built by the heritors under the incumbency of Thomas Brisbane in 1781. This manse adjoined the 7 acres of the glebe and was extended by the Revd Dickie. The Kirktoun of Dunlop composed the manses and a row of cottages dated 1644, 1765, 1773, etc.Ayr Arch Wigton, Page 34 Hans Hamilton and the Picture House John or Hans Hamilton (1535/6‚Äì1608), son of Archibald Hamilton of Raploch,Ayr Arch Wigton, Page 28 was the first Protestant vicar and exhorter of Dunlop Church. One of his sons, James Hamilton, was created Viscount Claneboye for his many services to James VI in establishing and maintaining Protestantism in Ireland; his son James was in turn created Earl Clanbrassil by Charles I. His five brothers also established estates in Ireland. A handsome mausoleum (NS 40486 49398) was constructed over their graves by James in 1641, when he was in his eighties, and this was so ornately painted and gilded in the Roman Catholic manner that it attracted the sobriquet of 'The Picture House'.\\"The Settlement Story.

Aiket Castle A view of Aiket Castle in 2006 Aiket Castle itself was originally a square tower typical of the residences of the lesser feudal Norman barons, originally surrounded by a moat. The name is derived from 'Oak Wood'. The family were descended from the Cunninghames of Bedland, who were cadets of the family of Glencairn. Alexander Cunninghame is the first recorded as living at Aiket. Three Aiket daughters were married to participants in the tale of the murder of the 4th Earl of Eglinton.'Rollie, Page 83 Pagan and pre-reformation sites=The Carlin Stone or Hag Stone On top of the Commoncraigs or Common Crags overlooking Dunlop and the Glazert is a large procumbent boulder known on the OS map as the ‚ÄòCarlin‚Äôs Stone or Stane‚Äô. A Carl is a commoner, a husband or in a derogatory sense, a churl or male of low birth. More commonly the name Carlin was used as a derogatory term for a woman meaning an 'old hag'. It is also said to be a corruption or Scots equivalentMcHardy, Page 25. of the Gaelic word \\"Cailleach\\", meaning a witch or the 'old Hag', the Goddess of Winter.

It is a glacial erratic stone, composed of blue augitic porphyrite and is quite unlike the 'native' stone of the district, weighing about 25 tons and measuring about twelve feet by eight feet as measured above ground.Ayr Hist Coll, Page 35 It is set near the site of the pre-reformation St. Mary's Chapel and has long been associated with pagan ritual practices. Few places have so many different names attached to them. One explanation is that the stone is 'Thor's Great Stone', another is that is \\"Thou Great Stone\\" or just '\\"grit stane\\",Paterson, Page 221 whilst 'The Stone of the Ogre' may reflect some forgotten legend of how the stone came to be in this position. Some names may be spelling errors perpetuated by or from Ordnance Survey and other maps. Another explanation of the name is that it is derived from 'Tagairtstane,' meaning the priest's stone. This 'Druidical' stone may have been a 'rocking or logan' stone at one time, but it is now firmly set in the 'rubbish' and soil. Another suggestion is that 'Ogrestane' is more 'Ogreton' and that the personal name 'Ogier' is a Normanised version of the Scandinavian name 'Holger'. Brandleside may be a Scandinavian name and suggest that 'Brandale' was once the name of this valley.David Clement. Dunlop Diary. December 2012 It is recorded that even as late as \\"the time of Popery\\" the devotees of that religion, in doing penance, used to crawl on their knees round this stone and cry, O thou grit stane from a belief that the Deity was in a peculiar manner present at that hallowed relic.Paterson, Page 221MacIntosh, Page 195.Aiton, Page 152 Farmers from Brandleside Farm were bound to protect, by not removing it or ploughing within a set distance of the stone, possibly because of a tradition of pagan burials around this monument. Some recollections of May Day events being held at the site are current and the site is listed and protected by Historic Scotland. A fine view of Dunlop or Borland Hill, the site of Dunlop Castle once held by the De Ross family, can be seen from the stone. Monastic settlement The history of the monastic settlement and the chapel of Saint Mary (NS 4080 5032) at the Thurgartstone is a parallel example to the Chapel Hill site at Chapeltoun, where a Christian centre was established to supplant the pagan significance of the site. Monastic cells, a chapel and a graveyard are all lost to view, constructed by the monks of Kilwinning, only the name 'Saint Mary's' given to the nearby 'modern' dwellings, built on the site of the chapel record past significance. Chapelhouse Farm is located beside the road nearby. The Holy Well still exists, the nearby houses pumping water up from its source. The water from the well used to run under the road and emerge in a trough surrounded by a metal fence. Only a concrete manhole indicates this trough now (2006). In 1856 the water for baptism in Dunlop Kirk was still drawn from this Holy Well.Name Book (1856). Ordnance Survey. A view from Chapelhouse Bridge (Lady's Steps) of the Chapel Crags with St. Mary's House in the distance The small chapel had an endowment for the support of a chaplain.Paterson, Page 220 It was abandoned at the time of the Reformation in Scotland led by the ex- Roman Catholic priest John Knox (1514 to 1572). The stones were robbed / mined by locals and the last remaining stones were taken away by a farmer in the 1830s. It stood on a rock from which a beautiful stream of water gushed into a small rivulet, this originally being crossed by steps, called the Lady's steps before the Chapelhouse Bridge was built. A carved relic of the old chapel, supposed to have been the font for holy water, was for some years used a trough for the pigs until it was finally broken up and used as building material. The Lady's Steps still existed in the late 1880s as they were on the path that ran from here to the Kirktoun of DunlopAyr Arch Wigton, Page 35 Steps cut out of the rock face led up to the hill behind the chapel where the monk's graveyard was apparently located. Some stone relics from St Mary's were given to a member of the local Clement family and a christening font was discovered in the burn at Kirkwood Farm by another Clement. There artifacts are now kept at North Borland Farm.Dunlop Diary. February 2013. The 1858 OS map locates the Lady's Steps near Hapland Mill on the Stewarton side of the town, crossing the Glazert. Patterson and Bayne,Bayne, Page 76 both local people writing in 1866 and 1935 respectively, place the steps at Chapel Crags. The first Statistical Account of Ayrshire also places the steps at Chapel Crags.Sinclair It seems odd to name these steps after a chapel that is a significant distance away in another valley; a cartographers error explains the situation as recorded in the first OS Name Book. A field near the 'Druid Stone' is called Templecroft and the first Celtic ‚ÄòCuldee‚Äô church may have been situated here, later replaced by the Roman Catholic Chapel. Ironically the pagan or Druidical stone is still there, but no sign of the Christian sites are visible, apart from the inconspicuous holy well in the field bordered by the burn. Craighead Law Hill A view of Craighead Law, probably used as a Justice or Moot Hill. The drained Halket Loch is near here. This Lea or Law hill, high, in the Lugton area of Dunlop Parish is supposed to be a 'moot' or trial hill. The arrangement of stones on its summit does not appear to be accidental and a grass covered cairn is very noticeable. A farmer from East Halket (pronounced 'whoreket') removed one of these to facilitate his ploughing. One stone on the summit has a vertical hole drilled to the depth of four feet or so, presumably to be used for ‚Äòslot‚Äô for a flagpole for flying a standard, a similar arrangement to that which existed at the Borestone at Greenhills near Beith. Near Aiket Castle is another Court Hill. Halket is called Hawkhead by Thomson on his map of 1832. Halket Loch covered about and was drained in the 1840s. It is shown on the early maps of Ayrshire. A photograph of 1913 shows a glacial erratic or such-like that was named the 'Lion Rock' as it had profile that resembled that animal. Craighead Law can be seen in the distance so it must have stood in the vicinity of the old Halket Loch. Grange A monastic grange, probably belonging to Kilwinning Abbey, may have existed there before the Reformation as suggested by the numerous place names evidence, with Grangehill, Townhead of Grange, Mid Grange, South Grange, etc. A glebe field was also located there and an old drove road which ran past Carswell FarmDownie (2009) and up to Paisley.Hall, Page 136 The Battle of Boyd's or Craignaught Hill {style=\\"float:left; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:27em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 10px; background-color: #F5F5F5; text-align:left;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Etymology - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:x-medium;\\" The name 'Craignaught' is derived from the Gaelic words 'Craig' (Rock) and 'Nochdta' (Naked), together literally mean 'Bare Rock' hill. Also recorded as Craighnaucht or Craignaugh.Paterson (1847), Page 108 } Craignaught Hill lies in the north- east area of the Parish of Dunlop, the Clerkland Burn running beneath and on to Dunlop House. On the lower slopes of Craignaught Hill was fought a singularly unusual battle between the Boyds of Kilmarnock and the Stewarts of Darnley. Sir Alan Stewart had been treacherously slain by Sir Thomas Boyd; his brother Alexander Stewart, nicknamed 'buktuth' (having a large projecting tooth) was determined to take revenge. Sir Alan had been killed at Polmais Thorn when they met, supposedly under a truce.Bonner, Page 351 Sir Thomas Boyd was surprised on the night of 7 July 1439, whilst riding past Craignaught on his way north and although outnumbered, he and his followers fought on, even taking agreed rest periods indicated by the sounding of a horn. The remaining Boyds placed themselves back to back, they closed up their ranks, and, forming a circle, they grimly set themselves to beat back the Stewarts or else die where they fought. Eventually and inevitably Sir Thomas Boyd was killed, whilst fighting Sir Alexander Stewart buktuth himself, stabbed in the back by a Stewart soldier, and a large number of his followers were also killed. The name is given as Sir Robert Boyd in at least one version of the tale.Robertson, Pages 295-305. The list of Stewarts involved is given as \\"..Alexander Stewart, buktuth, and his sonnis and Matthew Stewart with his brother and others syndry...\\" Image:Boydshillslack1.JPGBoyd's Hill and Boyd's slack Image:Boydshillslack2.JPGBoyd's Hill to the left and Boyd's slack Image:Craignaughtboydshill1.JPGBoyd's Hill (foreground) and Craignaught Hill, looking south Image:Boydshillsummit.JPGBoyd's Hill summit, looking south The results of this encounter led to killings and counter killings which involved a great part of the West of Scotland. Boyd's wife had previously dreamed all of that which came to pass and died of grief within days of her husband death.Robertson (1908), Page 332. The 1860 OS marks 'Boyd's Hill' and 'Boyd's slack', Scots for a narrow pass, to the north of Craignaught on the old lane to Grange Farm, now named South Grange. Boyd's Hill has been left undamaged (2007) by the quarrying and domestic waste disposal operations at Craignaught and the Boyd's slack is also clearly identifiable. Hugh Craig, author of \\"Ayrshire Aspirations in Verse and Prose\\" was born at Grange Farm, on the lands of which 'Boyd's Hill' stands, and he records that the place where the Stewart assassin hid was still pointed out in his day. He gives the date of the battle as July 9. 1439.Craig, Hugh (1856). Ayrshire Aspirations in Verse and Prose. Kilmarnock : James McKie. Page 184 The Gemmells of Templehouse The Knights Templar are remembered in the name of this property, formally called the 'Templeland of Dunlop Hill' but known commonly as Templehouse which since 1570 was in the hands of the Gemmill or Gemmell family.Paterson, James (1863-66). History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. V. - IV - Cunninghame. Edinburgh: J. Stillie. p.238. In 1596 Patrick Gemmill resigned the Templelands of Dunlop Hill into the hands of the Superior, Lord Torphichen, in favour of his eldest son. The Sandilands, Lords Torphichen are remembered elsewhere, such as Sandilands Farm near Kennox, although the farm name has now been changed to Bankend. The Gemmells still held Templehouse in the 1960s.Dobie, Page 379 The house had a walled garden with formal gardens and paths. The house and gardens are now (datum 2020) ruins. The Lands of Hapland {style=\\"float:left; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:27em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 10px; background-color: #F5F5F5; text-align:left;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Etymology - style=\\"text-align:left; font- size:x-medium;\\" The name may be a corruption of 'Whaup Land'; a 'whaup' being Scots for a curlew. } Prior to 1549 Hapland was part of the estate of Dunlop. David Dunlop exchanged or 'excambied' Hapland for the lands of Borland and in 1612 Patrick Cunninghame sold these lands to Gabriel Porterfield, son of Alexander Porterfield of that Ilk. Gabriel Porterfield of Porterfield in 1618 married Mariot Crawfurd and inherited the lands of Gills, Lothrihill, the Templeland and Maynes (Mains) of Hapland, including the mansion house. Gabriel Porterfield also took possession of Dunlop Hill, Wattirland (Waterland) and Halketh, with the loch (now drained). Dobie relates that On 31 May 1638, Gabriel Porterfield purchased from Neil Ryburn of that Ilk the 13s 4d. land of old extent of Ryburn, commonly called Temple-Ryburn. The estate of Hapland consisted of Brokwelmure (Brockwellmuir), Dunlophill-Montgomerie and Ryburn; later part of Lainshaw was purchased as well.Dobie, Page 205 The Laird of Hapland was the ruling elder in the Parish of Dunlop in 1649 and was a captain in the Scots army when Cromwell was in Scotland, for which his lands were sequestrated. The last of the male line died when he fell off his horse when returning from Stewarton about 1765 or 1770. Lillias Porterfield married William Somerville of Kennox. Their youngest child, a daughter, married Colonel McAlester, Laird of Loup, in Kintyre. A descendant built Chapelton House near Stewarton. Hapland is near Dunlop. In 1820 the estate was of and the proprietor was Lieutenant-General Alexander Trotter. The old mansion house was demolished around 1876 as it was not in keeping with the modern age. A new steading was built at the site, possibly the 'Newhouse' marked on the OS maps. Some of the old tree wind-breaks and policies of the estate can still be made out. It seems likely that Temple-Ryburn had its name changed to Hapland at around this time as the OS of 1858 shows Ryburn in the same position as later maps (1897, etc.) show Hapland. Mains Quarry The flooded Mains Quarry A section of the old tramway embankment The Mains Quarry siding lay between Dunlop and the Gameshill road overbridge on the old G&SWR; double track line running towards Stewarton. It was a single siding running parallel to the main line towards the road overbridge. The processed whinstone stone was carried to the siding by a narrow gauge tramway, raised for approximately half its length on a narrow embankment running for a total of just over 1000 ft (305m) from the Mains Quarry buildings. The quarry and its tramway lay to the west of the main line between the farms of South Netherhouses and Mains of Aiket. Quarrying had already taken place at Mains since at least 1856 and thus prior to the 1871 opening of the G&SWR; line. The quarry‚Äôs narrow gauge line is recorded as a tramway on the 1909/10 25 inch to the mile OS map, by which time it appears to have already become disused as no infrastructure is shown where it reaches the siding, although the standard gauge private siding itself is still shown running down towards the road overbridge at that date. A section of lifted track and trackbed may be represented by dotted lines on the map, lying parallel to the private siding. It is not obvious how the stone was transferred however it is clear that the narrow gauge line lay some height above the private siding at the point where they met. A signal post is shown to the south of this siding‚Äôs point work and what may have been a ground frame stands nearby. The tramway line curved tightly away from the main line and then ran westwards in a straight line, parallel to the sides of the quarry to the site of the old quarry buildings, where the line seems to have forked. The quarry covered around three acres at this date, however later maps show that it was still being worked and road transport used, before being finally abandoned and allowed to flood. Micro-history In 1820, Dunlop had only two people qualified to vote by right as freeholders. A new gravitational water supply was opened for Dunlop in 1896, fed from a spring at Sidehead, the old water supply having been condemned.Campbell, Page 6. Dunlop and Stewarton both stand on the old turnpike, completed from Glasgow by Lugton, to Kilmarnock, Irvine and Ayr in 1820 at the cost of ¬£18,000.Pride, Page 109. Dunlop Cattle are said to have originated within the parish, bred by Dunlop of that Ilk from improved stock from Holland in around 1550 to 1700 or later. The breed, also known as Cunninghame or Ayrshire cattle, are pied, white and brown, short in leg, long in the horn, straight in the back: the bulls are fiery in temper. The cow are peculiarly placid and docile, producing milk which is very high in butterfat. The lands of Netherhill were purchased by John Love of Threepwood in the early 19th century. Freemasonry Freemasonry started in Dunlop in the early 19th century. On 4 May 1824 a charter was granted to the brethren of Dunlop to practice Freemasonry and this continued for many years as Lodge Dunlop Caledonian No. 311. It was declared dormant in 1881 since no communications had been received by Grand Lodge for more than seven years. The only known record from Lodge Caledonian No. 311 is that the first master was a John Gemmell, the first secretary was Robert Fulton and the lodge colours were crimson with a tartan trim. On 19 October 1944 a meeting was held in the public school by the local school master Mr Peter Calderwood, who was a member of Lodge St John Maybole no. 11 and 38 others who were members of various Lodges within and out with Ayrshire. Several letters were exchanged between Grand Lodge and Peter Calderwood until on 29 March 1945 a meeting was held in the public hall chaired by Bro. Joseph Johnston who was a past master of Stewarton Thistle, to elect the office bearers for the new lodge. A letter was sent to Edinburgh (Grand Lodge of Scotland) along with a list of 110 petitioners on 20 April and a charter was granted. Unfortunately because of the number of lapsed years they could not get the original number or colours. The colours today are green with gilt trim. The Erection and Consecration of the new Lodge, Lodge Dunlop Caledonia No. 1408 took place in Dunlop Public hall on 3 November 1945. There was a large assembly of brethren including many deputations from 48 lodges within and out with Ayrshire. A total of 341 brethren signed the attendance book to witness Bro Joseph Johnston installed as the first Master of Lodge Dunlop Caledonia No. 1408 by Lieut. Col. Wallace Cunningham of Ayrshire. A collection taken for the Lodge benevolence amounted to ¬£34.6 shillings. After the meeting, 110 brethren sat down to a meal at a cost of 6 shillings (30p) per head. At a meeting held on 22 November, Mr William Stevenson, Archiebald Howie and Archibald Baillie were the first candidates of the new lodge. By now the lodge was well on its way with a total of 229 candidates having passed through up to the present day. Throughout Scotland, nine lodges have the Caledonian in their title, and on 24 September 1983 the first of the annual \\"Caledonian Gatherings\\" was held at Annan by Lodge Caledonian Annan No.238 supported by Caledonian St John Lennoxtown No. 195 Caledonian Dundee no. 254, St Mary's Caledonian Inverness No. 339, The Caledonian Railway (Glasgow) No. 354, Motherwell Caledonian no. 1228, Caledonian Lodge of Uganda (Edinburgh) No.1228 and Caledonian Dunlop No.1408. Each lodge takes its turn to host the annual event with Dunlop Caledonia No. 1408 hosting it for the third time on 19 September 2016 The brethren of the lodge elected Bro Jimmy Laing its master in October 2019 and he was installed on 13 December 2019. The lodge meets on the second and fourth Thursday of the month with the exception of May to August.

His Ph.D. was conferred at Harvard in 1968 with a dissertation on the reform policies of Heungseon Daewongun in the late 1800s. His dissertation was published under the title Politics and Policies in Traditional Korea by Harvard University Press in 1975. At Harvard he had worked with Edward W. Wagner, one of the founders of Korean studies in North America. Career Palais taught at Norfolk State University and the University of Maine before being recruited to help build up what was then known as the Far Eastern and Russian Institute at the University of Washington. He became chairman of the Korean Studies Program there, and in 2002 he was made chairman of the East Asian Studies Institute at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, Korea as well. Palais' arrival in 1968 made the University of Washington program the largest Korean Studies Program on the North American mainland because there were three full-time scholars devoted exclusively to the study of Korea. From 1974-77, Palais edited Occasional Papers on Korean Studies, as known as the Journal of Korean Studies, which was edited out of the University of Washington until 1988. Palais' political interests resulted in the Asia Watch report Human Rights in Korea (Washington, 1986), but perhaps his greatest work was the 1230-page Confucian Statecraft and Korean Institutions: Yu Hyongwon and the late Choson Dynasty, a comprehensive overview of Choson Dynasty (1392-1910) Korean institutions as discussed by the eminent 17th century Korean statesman,. This book was awarded the John Whitney Hall book prize as the best book on Japan or Korea in 1998. Palais was recognized with the Yongjae Paek Nakchun Award from Korea's Yonsei University in 1995, and by The Association for Asian studies with a lifetime achievement award in Asian Studies in 2001. Palais was Dean for International Studies at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea for three years. Palais continued his activity at the University of Washington with editing, writing, and part-time teaching in the Korea Studies Program until hospitalized with his final illness in the spring of 2005.

New Jersey v. T. L. O. In 1984, the school was involved in a case that made it to the Supreme Court of the United States. A 14-year-old freshman, known only by the initials T. L. O., was caught by a teacher smoking in a bathroom with another girl at the high school. The teacher took both students to the Principal's Office where they met with Assistant Vice Principal Theodore Choplick. In a search of T. L. O.'s purse, Choplick observed a pack of cigarettes, and while removing the cigarettes he noticed a package of rolling papers, often closely tied to the use of marijuana. Choplick then began a more thorough search for the evidence of drugs, which revealed a small amount of marijuana, a pipe, empty plastic bags, a large quantity of money in $1 bills, an index card that appeared to list students who owed T. L. O. money, and two letters that implicated T. L. O. in being a drug dealer. Choplick then notified T. L. O.'s mother and the police, to whom he turned over the evidence of drug dealing. The police requested the mother to take her daughter to police headquarters, where T. L. O. confessed to selling marijuana at the high school. Using the confession and the evidence obtained by Choplick's search, the State brought delinquency charges against T. L. O. in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Middlesex County. T. L. O. claimed the assistant principal's search violated the Fourth Amendment. She moved to suppress the evidence found in her purse as well as her confession, arguing, the evidence was \\"fruit of the poisonous tree.\\" The Juvenile Court denied the motion to suppress. Although the court concluded that the Fourth Amendment did apply to searches carried out by school officials, it held: :\\"a school official may properly conduct a search of a student's person if the official has a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is in the process of being committed, or reasonable cause to believe that the search is necessary to maintain school discipline or enforce school policies.\\" Id., at 341, 428 A. 2d, at 1333 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the search and seizure by school officials without a warrant was constitutional, as long as the search is deemed reasonable. This overturned the New Jersey Supreme Court ruling. Piscataway Board of Education v. Sharon Taxman Piscataway Board of Education v. Taxman, 91 F.3d 1547 (3d Cir. 1996) was a racial discrimination case begun in 1989. The school board of Piscataway, New Jersey needed to eliminate a teaching position from the high school Business Education department. Under New Jersey state law, tenured teachers have to be laid off in reverse order of seniority. The newest tenured teachers, Sharon Taxman and Debra Williams, white and African-American respectively, had started working at the school on the same day. In the interest of maintaining racial diversity (Williams was the only black teacher in the department, and 50% of the students were minorities), the school board voted to lay off Taxman, even though she had a master's degree and Williams only had a bachelor's degree. Taxman complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, saying that the board had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.Piscataway Township Board of Education v. Taxman - Significance, Taxman Fights Dismissal On Racial Grounds, Court Of Appeals Ruling, Dissent And Aftermath, JRank Law Library - American Law and Legal Information. Accessed December 31, 2011. The Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Taxman. The school board appealed to the United States Supreme Court and a hearing was scheduled for January 1998, but an agreement was reached to pay Taxman a $435,000 settlement before the case could be heard by the court, with a majority of the money coming from civil rights organizations that feared that the Supreme Court could use the case as a justification to eliminate the practice of affirmative action.Goodnough, Abby. \\"Financial Details Are Revealed In Affirmative Action Settlement\\", The New York Times, December 6, 1997. Accessed December 31, 2011. \\"The lawyer, David B. Rubin, said he had asked the coalition of civil rights groups, known as the Black Leadership Forum, to send its portion of the settlement -- $300,000 -- in advance as a guarantee.... The coalition, in a highly unusual move, offered last month to pay most of the $433,500 settlement to Sharon Taxman, a white teacher at Piscataway High School whom the board had dismissed in a 1989 budget reduction to preserve a black teacher's job.... Civil rights leaders offered to help finance the settlement because they feared the Supreme Court would use the case to strike down almost all affirmative action programs.\\" Taxman was subsequently rehired. Both teachers returned to teaching in Piscataway. Williams went back to the high school, while Taxman was reassigned to Conackamack Middle School.

The band has achieved much through its years, including numerous USSBA Championships. The band began as a small group in the 1950s and existed with little or no fanfare. Starting in 1971 led by Band Directors R. Bruce Bradshaw and Joseph T. Mundi it quickly grew from 44 members to 204 members and consistently represents nearly 10% of the entire school's student body, year after year. The Superchiefs have recorded music for CBS, The Walt Disney Company, and were in the 2002 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Famed percussion instructor Dennis DeLucia previously wrote and arranged the percussion music for the drumline, but has since parted ways with the band. Over the years the Superchiefs have been featured in several TV shows, including American Oompah and The Superchiefs Go To Ireland for PBS, Mario And The Magic Movie Machine for CBS, and Today in New York for NBC. The band has performed at numerous halftimes for the New York Giants, New York Jets, Washington Redskins, and Buffalo Bills, as well as pre‚Äîgame ceremonies for the New York Mets. The band has also worked for the Walt Disney Company at the Radio City Music Hall premier of Pete's Dragon and Mickey's 50th Birthday Whistlestop tour at Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan. In the 1980s, the band garnered international acclaim, touring Ireland in 1981 and 1985 and capturing first place in the Dublin and Limerick St. Patrick's Day Parades on each trip. The band continued its success on a national level as well, taking first place at the World of Music Festival in San Diego, California in 1983 and 1987, and at the Festivals of Music in Orlando, Florida in 1989. They also won consecutive New York City St. Patrick's Day Parades early in the decade, and they continued to be locally successful, placing first in numerous shows around the slate. They won the first-over Tropicana Bowl Mid-Atlantic Championship at Rutgers Stadium in 1983. and the first-ever CMBC (USSBA) competition at Giants Stadium in 1988, featuring top-level bands from the Tri-State Region. During the 1990s the Superchiefs have focused on the CMBC (USSBA) circuit that features some of the finest bands in the Eastern United States. The band has won live consecutive Group V Open Championships, from 1990 through 1994. and again in 1996. In addition, the band has placed in five Bands of America Eastern Regional Finals Championships in 1996. 1997, 1998, 2002, and 2003 and won the Yamaha Corporation's Yamaha Cup Preview of Champions in 2001 & 2002\\\\. In 2002, the Superchiefs also look first place in the USSBA New Jersey state championships. This was the first-ever 'State Champions' title awarded to the band. Another first in the history of the Superchiefs, the band was invited to perform in the 2002 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which aired on NBC on November 28, 2002. Since then, the band has continued its successes and its quest for excellence which has been upheld by \\"excellent\\" ratings at the New Jersey State Band Festivals, 3rd-place finish at the USSBA Championships in 2004, and special recognition award by the New Jersey State Board of Education.

Originally a communist, he continued to hold decidedly left-wing views after he joined the Labour Party, and was Member of Parliament for Sheffield Hillsborough for 18 years, from February 1974 to 1992. Early life Flannery was born in Hillsborough, in Sheffield. His father, who was born in County Tipperary,Profile of (and by) Flannery in The House Magazine, 21 February 1986 was a foreman at a steel works (and a former soldier in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers). His mother was born in Sheffield, but was of Irish parentage on both sides. He was educated at the Sacred Heart School in Hillsborough and the local Catholic grammar school De La Salle College, which is now All Saints. Obituary, The Guardian, 19 October 2006 He attended Sheffield College of Education and Sheffield Teachers' Training College, and began to work as a teacher, but then volunteered to join the British Army in the Second World War. He joined the 1st Battalion, Royal Scots; he was sent to India in 1942, and was wounded in Burma in 1945. He was a warrant officer when he was demobilised. He married in 1949, and had one son and two daughters. Teaching He resumed teaching at a primary school in Sheffield in 1946. He was opposed to corporal punishment. He became headteacher of Crookesmoor Junior School in Sheffield in 1969. He was a left-wing member of the National Union of Teachers, and was a member of the NUT national executive from 1970 to 1974. He had joined the Communist Party of Great Britain following his demobilisation in 1945, but left after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when he realised that Soviet claims of democracy were a sham. Politics He was elected as Member of Parliament for Sheffield Hillsborough at the February 1974 general election. He held off strong Liberal Party challenges to his position in the 1983 and 1987 general elections, surviving by 1,546 votes (2.8%) on the former occasion. He was also challenged for his seat by fellow Labour left-winger Clive Betts in 1985. Activism Politically, he was a Communist until the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was crushed by the Soviet Union; subsequently, he became a strong critic of Stalinism, and a strong advocate of human rights, with close links to Amnesty International. He joined the Labour party, but remained on the far left; his wife remained a Communist until the Communist Party of Great Britain was disbanded. He held anti-Zionist (but not anti-Jewish) views, and supported the Palestine Liberation Organization. He was of Irish descent, and supported the Irish republican cause, opposing the Prevention of Terrorism Act; however, after visiting Northern Ireland in 1994, he came to support the presence of British troops to protect Catholics from loyalist violence. He also opposed the European Community, opposed New Labour, and opposed the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flannery was chairman of the left-wing Tribune Group of Labour MPs from 1980 to 1981, but left to form the hard left Campaign Group. In 1982, he was one of 32 Labour MPs to vote against the Falklands War, defying the party whip to abstain.

Career Born in Rochester, New York, Chapman began her stage career as early as 1898 when she appeared in New York City in The Charity Ball. She performed at the Shubert Theater in Brooklyn in a production of The Light Eternal in 1907. The play was a romantic drama of Imperial Rome which was supported by a cast of approximately 100 people. Chapman played maternal roles in numerous silent motion pictures and became known in the 1920s as Hollywood's Mother. She played Ma Jones in the film version of Lightnin' (1925), a screen production which featured Will Rogers. Edythe was Grandmother Janeway in Man Crazy (1927). The film starred Dorothy Mackaill and Jack Mulhall. Chapman was praised by reviewers for her performance.

As a state defense force, the Wisconsin State Defense Force, alongside the Wisconsin National Guard, is organized under the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs as a part of the military forces of Wisconsin. However, unlike the National Guard, the State Defense Force is a purely state- controlled organization and cannot be deployed outside the state of Wisconsin. When any part of the Wisconsin National Guard is called into service of the United States, the adjutant general (who is appointed by the governor) may recruit volunteers to the WSDF to serve within the borders of Wisconsin. History=Wisconsin home guards The military of the United States during the American Civil War was composed of a smaller professional army supported by various state militia volunteer units. Wisconsin provided multiple units to fight in the war. Initially, the War Department only requested one volunteer regiment from Wisconsin, leaving thousands of men eager to serve militarily but unable to enter the war until much later as the conflict continued longer than the federal government had anticipated. The desire of these men to serve, along with a fear of domestic unrest caused by Confederate sympathizers, caused the Wisconsin Legislature and Governor Louis P. Harvey created a legal framework for local militia companies to organize, drill, and serve as a home guard unit capable of handling state emergencies. World War I During World War I, when the National Guard was federalized and deployed, the state of Wisconsin created a state guard of volunteers, officially titled the Wisconsin State Guard. Members of the Wisconsin State Guard served solely as state soldiers, unlike members of the National Guard who had dual federal and state responsibilities. While the Wisconsin State Guard could not be federalized, individual members of the guard were still eligible to be drafted into federal service. Many of those who first served in the Wisconsin State Guard were inducted into the federal military at a higher rank than those enlisted who had not served any state duty. Unlike many other state defense forces, the Wisconsin State Guard was trained and equipped by the state of Wisconsin rather than relying on the War Department for donated surplus equipment. The Wisconsin State Guard consisted of several infantry regiments and drilled at National Guard bases across the state, including Camp Douglas. World War II The Wisconsin State Guard was again called into service during World War II for homeland security purposes while the Wisconsin National Guard was deployed abroad. Legal status State defense forces are authorized by the federal government under Title 32, Section 109 of the United States Code. Wisconsin law also allows the governor to reactivate the Wisconsin State Defense Force at any time when any part of the Wisconsin National Guard is called into federal service. Therefore, the WSDF can be reactivated either by an act of legislature or by an executive order by the Governor of Wisconsin. Legal protection Under Wisconsin law, members of the state defense force who are activated during an emergency are guaranteed a leave of absence from their place of employment, and must be reinstated to their former position when their deployment ends, without loss of pay, seniority, health insurance coverage, or other benefits.

Nighttime and weekend hours are leased to various ethnic and specialty programmers. During part of the weekend, the station airs a Caribbean format, \\"One Caribbean Radio.\\" Broadcast signal WSNR is unusual in that it runs more power at night than in the daytime, the reverse of many AM radio stations. It transmits with 3,000 watts days and 7,600 watts nights, from five nearly in-line towers in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. The signal is directed at Midtown Manhattan, as a consequence of protection requirements to adjacent-channel stations to the northeast and southwest of the transmitter site. (WTEL 610 Philadelphia and WPRO 630 Providence, Rhode Island are both powered at 5,000 watts.) With WSNR's signal pattern, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens are well-covered, as is Nassau County, New York, although some of New York's northern and southern suburbs are not. This is the second transmitter site for this station. As WVNJ, licensed to Newark, New Jersey, it was powered at 5,000 watts day and night, but with separate antenna patterns from a tower site in Livingston, New Jersey, near Route 10. History=The WVNJ years WVNJ first signed on the air December 7, 1948.WVNJ STARTS Jersey Outlet Begins, Broadcasting - Telecasting December 13, 1948 pg. 30 It was licensed to Newark and owned by the Newark Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of the Griffith Piano Company, to showcase its instruments. In the 1950s through 1970s, the station played Broadway and Hollywood show tunes as well as instrumental and vocal easy listening music. In 1961, then-owner Herb Saltzman acquired the license to 100.3 MHz, formerly WMGM-FM, which had been terminated in 1955. At first, Saltzman simulcast both stations, however in a few years, WVNJ-FM became an instrumental-based beautiful music station. WVNJ AM 620 had evolved into an all-adult standards format by the early 1970s, playing artists such as Frank Sinatra, Benny Goodman, Mills Brothers, Barbra Streisand, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Charles, Andrews Sisters, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Peggy Lee, Artie Shaw, The Carpenters, Vic Damone, Sammy Davis Jr., Connie Francis, Patti Page, Johnny Mathis and Dinah Shore. In 1980, when 106.7 WRVR (now WLTW) New York dropped Jazz programming to become Country WKHK, WVNJ-FM adopted a night-time jazz format, keeping its daytime easy listening format of instrumentals and usually three vocals per hour. At that point, WVNJ 620 picked up the beautiful music format for night-time hours while keeping big bands and adult standards during the day. Ratings were low on WVNJ 620 due to the fact it had a weak signal and AM 1130 WNEW was also doing an adult standards format by 1981. Spanish Broadcasting System In August 1983, WVNJ-FM was sold to the Malrite Communications Group and became Top 40 \\"Z 100\\" WHTZ. AM 620 WVNJ was sold that October to the Spanish Broadcasting System (SBS). The station switched to a Spanish-language adult contemporary format as WSKQ. It moved to studios in Manhattan. After SBS bought an FM station, the WSKQ call sign switched to FM 97.9. AM 620 became WXLX and aired a Regional Mexican music format beginning in 1990. Sports radio In 1997, the station was sold to One On One Sports. It became WJWR as a full time sports radio outlet. After One on One Sports merged with the Sporting News newspaper, the network was renamed Sporting News Radio. The call letters were then changed to WSNR. In 2001, the station was acquired by Rose City Radio. Several New Jersey political leaders noted that Jersey City was the largest city in the nation without a commercial AM, FM to TV station. So around 2002, WSNR was re- licensed to Jersey City, coupled with a request for more nighttime power.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2003-2004 page D-306 WJWR, and later WSNR, was the flagship station for the New York Islanders hockey team, and at various times carried the play by play for the New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), the New York CityHawks of the Arena Football League, and the Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team of the New York‚ÄìPenn League. From 2001 to 2006, the station was owned by Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures. Despite the ownership change, it retained the station's affiliation with Sporting News Radio. The station was also briefly a Motor Racing Network (MRN) affiliate and was the only New York metro area station broadcasting NASCAR events. During this time, the station began selling blocks of time to independent producers while still airing sports the other hours of the day. From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays, WSNR featured a big band show playing only music from the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s. This show was produced and hosted by Danny Stiles.

Dylkes, also referred to as the Leatherwood God, was a messianic figure in the early settlement of the Ohio Country in the United States. Very little is known about Dylkes. Details about his birth, as well as information regarding his whereabouts following his enigmatic disappearance remain apocryphal. Dylkes achieved notoriety in August 1828, at a camp meeting near a chapel known as the Leatherwood Church in Salesville, Ohio. On a Sunday afternoon, the United Brethren minister John Crum was preaching to a large congregation when a voice shouted \\"Salvation\\" followed by a strange sound, taken by all who heard it to be the snort of a horse. Everyone was taken by surprise and turned to see a stranger dressed in a black broadcloth suit, frock coat, white cravat, and yellow beaver hat. He appeared to be between the ages of 45 and 50 and wore long black hair. The stranger was hosted by some members of that congregation. He attended various religious meetings, and sometimes preached. Displaying knowledge of the Bible, he started to declare himself a celestial being, and finally claimed he was the Messiah come to establish a kingdom that would never end. His assertion of immortality was bolstered by claims that no one could harm him or touch a single hair of his head. Some families accepted his claims and became his followers, stirring controversy in the Ohio valley. A mob bent on discrediting him came to a religious service in the home of a Dylkes follower and tore out a considerable lock of his hair to demonstrate his mortality. Dylkes was taken before the local Squire to be charged but was released on the grounds that it \\"was not a crime to be a god.\\" Dylkes took refuge in a farm belonging to one of his followers and ultimately declared he was going to Philadelphia to establish a \\"New Jerusalem.\\" During the trip he disappeared without a trace. A few of his believers, such as Michael Brill and Robert McCormick, died believing in Dylkes. They call him [the leatherwood god] due to the fact that Dylkes would place rocks in the [Leatherwood Creek] to see as if he was walking on water. He placed them in certain to where people couldn‚Äôt see him walking in the rocks. Everyone thought he was Jesus because he was ‚Äúwaking‚Äù on water. It wasn‚Äôt until months later, 3 teenage boys went down to the creek and found the rocks he would walk on. They moved the rocks and one day, Dylkes was going to demonstrate on how he could ‚Äúwalk‚Äù on water. Seconds later, he fell into the creek and from that point on, everyone knew he was a fake.

He played as a halfback for the LSU Tigers football team of Louisiana State University, where he was notable for his passing skills and play-making ability, which earned him the nickname \\"Miracle Mickal\\". He was also the team's primary punter and placekicker. A three-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection, Mickal led LSU to an undefeated season in 1933 and a conference championship and Sugar Bowl in 1935. In 1936, Mickal played quarterback for a college all-star team that was the first team of college players to defeat a professional team. Although selected in the 1936 NFL Draft, he did not play professionally. Mickal was a charter member of the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1937 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967. In addition to football, Mickal was a cadet in LSU's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), was a member of the pre-med club and debate team, and as a senior was president of the university's student body. While a student, he was offered a seat in the Louisiana State Senate by U.S. Senator and noted LSU supporter Huey Long, which he declined. He earned his medical degree in 1940, and after serving in World War II began a lifelong career in obstetrics and gynecology. He served as head professor of the LSU Medical School OB/GYN department for over twenty years. Actively involved in various university affairs during and after his time as a student, Mickal was honored as LSU's \\"Alumnus of the Year\\" in 1980. Early life Ibrahim Khalil Mickal was born in the Levant, in an area that is today part of Lebanon, and immigrated with his family to the United States in 1920 and arrived on Ellis Island. He settled in McComb, Mississippi and attended McComb High School, where he played football, baseball, and basketball and ran track.American Gynecological & Obstetrical Society In Memoriam His father Kalil, who ran a local general store, was initially against his son playing sports. \\"It was an old Lebanese custom,\\" Mickal later explained, \\"that the eldest son take over the business. My father wasn't aware that I was playing.\\" His father was eventually persuaded by the townspeople to let his son play. During his senior year, he was recruited by LSU and Notre Dame to play football, and ultimately chose the Tigers after the death of Notre Dame head coach Knute Rockne. College Mickal was an all-around player; a triple-threat running back who also played on defense. He was regarded as an excellent deep-ball passer; in the words of LSU coach Lawrence \\"Biff\\" Jones: \\"Mickal is a greater passer than Red Cagle‚Äîhe's the greatest I ever saw.\\" Jones was Cagle's coach while at Army. One sportswriter referred to Mickal as \\"the Dizzy Dean of the nation's forward passers.\\" He was also known for his play-making ability during crucial moments of games, and LSU compiled a win‚Äìloss record of 23‚Äì4‚Äì5 in the three seasons Mickal played for the team. 1933 Mickal showed his versatility in the first game of the 1933 season against Rice, tossing a 40-yard pass on the first play from scrimmage to end Pete Burge and booting punts of 76 and 61 yards. In week four against Arkansas Mickal completed touchdown passes of 48 and 57 yards and ran for a 15-yard touchdown, as he was responsible for every score in the 20‚Äì0 win over the eventual Southwest Conference champion Razorbacks. He scored the only touchdown of LSU's final game of the season, against Tennessee, with a goal line dive into the end zone. He also kicked the extra point for the 7‚Äì0 victory, and completed the season having successfully made every extra point he attempted. The Tigers finished undefeated with three ties in their first season as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). After the season, Mickal was named to the United Press (UP) All-SEC second team as a halfback. 1934 One of Mickal's most notable games came in 1934 against the Mustangs of Southern Methodist. He threw two touchdown passes, the first one a 32-yarder to tie the game at 7‚Äì7 in the second quarter. Late in the fourth quarter and down by a touchdown, Mickal dropped back at his own 35-yard line and hurled a pass down the middle of the field. It was caught in stride at the Mustang 20-yard line by Gaynell Tinsley, who ran it into the end zone to tie the game at 14‚Äì14, which was the final score. In week four against 13th-ranked Arkansas, Mickal completed five of seven passes for 117 yards, which included a 52-yard bomb in the third quarter for the first score of the 16‚Äì0 win. He also averaged over 50 yards per punt on nine punts. The next week he threw a touchdown pass, kicked a field goal, and averaged over 40 yards per punt in a 29‚Äì0 win over previously undefeated Vanderbilt. Mickal was named a first-team All-SEC selection as a fullback by the Associated Press (AP) and as a halfback by the UP. =Senatorship offer= During the season, Mickal was acclaimed an honorary Louisiana State Senator by U.S. Senator Huey P. Long, whom he had befriended, at a burlesque campus meeting. Long was a noted LSU supporter and was highly involved in operations of the football program. When it came time for his ceremonial \\"seating\\" Mickal refused to appear for the ceremony, despite the urging of Long. After Long reasoned with the senate and spectators that Mickal \\"had to study,\\" Mickal was granted a five-day leave of absence by senator Harvey Peltier to \\"do his work at school and go forward with his preparation for his football duties.\\" Mickal remained silent on the matter, however; he did not give a reason for his refusal of the honor. The day he was to be inducted, Mickal said in a telegram to Long that if he accepted the senatorship he would introduce a joint resolution that made it \\"unlawful\\" for any Tulane player to cross the LSU goal line in 1934. 1935 Mickal had a slow start to 1935 while he recovered from a broken ankle he suffered over the summer. In week three, he threw two touchdown passes against Manhattan College, and a game-winning touchdown pass against Vanderbilt two weeks later. In the regular season finale, Mickal was responsible for three touchdowns in a 41‚Äì0 win over rival Tulane. LSU faced the TCU Horned Frogs at the end of the season in the Sugar Bowl, in a game that was a highly anticipated match-up between Mickal and the Horned Frogs' Sammy Baugh. The offenses were unable to do much, however, as rain throughout the day had muddied the field. TCU won the game, 3‚Äì2. LSU finished the season undefeated in conference play for its first SEC championship. Mickal was named to the AP All-SEC second-team as a fullback after the season, and earned second-team All-America honors from Liberty magazine. 1936 All-Stars vs. Bears In September 1936, Mickal played quarterback for the Centennial College All-Stars, a team composed of college players from southern schools to play against the National Football League's Chicago Bears at Cotton Bowl stadium. He scored the All-Stars' only touchdown with a dive into the end zone from the one-foot line in the third quarter. The Bears scored their only touchdown later that quarter on a 5-yard run by Bronko Nagurski. Mickal had a chance to tackle Nagurski before the goal line. \\"A lot of things flashed through my mind,\\" explained Mickal. \\"There was nothing between him and the goal line but me. I thought about making the perfect tackle and reading about being the All-Stars' hero. Then I thought about Nagurski's size. I thought about the Nagurski legend. I thought about going to med school. I thought about possible brain damage.\\" He decided to step aside and let Nagurski score. The extra point, however, was blocked by Bob Reynolds, and the game ended 7‚Äì6 in favor of the All-Stars. It was the first time a team of college players defeated a professional American football team. Extracurricular Mickal was actively involved in the university's Reserve Officers' Training Corps. He received the Outstanding Cadet Award as a freshman and was regimental sergeant major as a junior. As a senior, he attained the rank of Cadet Colonel and earned the Kemper Williams Sabre as the school's outstanding cadet. Additionally, he was a member of the pre-med club and debate team, and in 1936 was president of the school's Interfraternity Council, college of arts and sciences, and student body. Mickal was a member of the Theta Kappa Nu fraternity. Medical career Mickal was the first player from LSU to ever be drafted into the NFL, selected in the sixth round of the 1936 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. However, he did not play in the NFL. He instead chose to complete his medical degree at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine, where he graduated from in 1940. He served as a major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II. After the war, he worked in obstetrics and gynecology at New Orleans Charity Hospital from 1946 to 1949, shortly after which he was hired to the LSU medical faculty. In 1959, he became the head professor of the LSU Medical School, a position he served in until his retirement in 1980. He was a founding member of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, and served as president of the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons from 1981 to 1982. From 1985 until his death in 2001 he was vice president for medical affairs at Kenner Regional Medical Center. Honors Mickal was a charter member of the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1937. In 1967, the National Football Foundation named Mickal to the College Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1969 and the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in 1985. Mickal was named LSU's \\"Alumnus of the Year\\" in 1980 and its \\"Medical Alumnus of the Year\\" in 1985. \\"It's been a beautiful marriage‚Äîand I've had all the better of it,\\" said Mickal of his involvement with the university. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists gave Mickal its Distinguished Service Award in 1991.

USS Lumen served as a commissioned ship for 14 months. Lumen (AKA‚Äì30) was laid down by Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc. Providence, R.I., 19 July 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract; launched 20 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Alex Walker; and commissioned 29 December 1944, Lt. Comdr. Thomas A. Marshall, Jr., in command. Service history After shakedown, Lumen departed Norfolk 29 January 1945, loaded troops and equipment at Pearl Harbor, then sailed for the Okinawa campaign, the largest amphibious operation of the Pacific War. Following brief stops in Eniwetok and Ulithi, the cargo ship arrived off Okinawa 17 April and under the threat of night air raids unloaded the men and cargo which were needed to secure this strategic base so close to Japan. Departing Okinawa, Lumen arrived Saipan 27 April and for the rest of the war shuttled cargo among the islands in the South and central Pacific. She was at Pearl Harbor when news of Japan‚Äôs acceptance of the surrender terms was announced. Although the major task of winning the war was successfully completed, another important mission lay ahead for the Navy. Returning to the western Pacific in mid-September, Lumen carried cargo in the Philippines and Japan to provide the occupation troops with reinforcements and supplies. Completing her duties in the Pacific, the cargo ship embarked veterans for return to the United States and steamed for the West Coast arriving early in 1946. Lumen‚Äôs short but useful career ended when she decommissioned at Charleston 23 March 1946. She was turned over to the War Shipping Administration 5 November 1946, placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, and was berthed at Beaumont, Texas, until sold for scrap to Luria Bros. Co., Inc., 17 December 1964. Lumen received one battle star for World War II service.

Construction  The island was created in 1719, when the newly built Kryukov Canal and Admiralty Canal connected the Moika River with the Neva. The triangular island took its name after a number of canals and shipbuilding facilities that rendered its appearance similar to Amsterdam. The island was originally built for timber storage. Peter the Great took the opportunity to create a naval port, including a wooden palace for his own use. In 1821, it became the country's first military port.  Army property  During the following centuries, the island belonged to the Russian Admiralty, which would adapt the plot for its various needs. Originally, there was a minor shipyard for rowing boats. In 1732, the Admiralty engaged architect to construct a network of basins and wooden warehouses along the island's perimeter in order to store lumber for shipbuilding. In 1765, Savva Chevakinsky was ordered to rebuild the warehouses in brick but without customary stucco decoration. By 1788, when the project was halted, Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe had designed and supervised the construction of a highly pitched Neoclassical arch over the canal. This magnificent red-brick gateway to the island, known as the New Holland Arch, is flanked by massive Tuscan columns of red granite. New Holland did not achieve its present appearance until the building of a naval prison in 1828‚Äì29 and a basin for naval architects in 1893. Aleksei Krylov used this basin for testing new models of ships between 1900 and 1908. The most powerful radio station in Imperial Russia was launched there by the General Staff of the Navy in 1915. After the Russian Revolution, the 18th-century buildings of New Holland Island fell into neglect. From 1918 to 2004, it was used by the army as a mixed-use facility.  2000s revival  On Navy Day in 2000, New Holland was opened to the public for the emplacements project (1997‚Äì2000), an art project created by artists Fran√ßoise Dupr√© and Roxane Permar with support from Russian artists, including Lyudmila Belova and Tatyana Nikolaenko, involving over two dozen artists altogether. In 2004, the Ministry of Defense evacuated the buildings, which were to be refurbished for hotels and clubs to a design by Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank, until the consortium running the project ran into difficulties. Since 2010, the island is owned by the Iris Foundation (Daria Zhukova's art foundation). A new project was established with space for galleries and a museum, possibly to house Abramovich's art collection. The $12 billion dollar redevelopment project was awarded to NY-based architecture firm WORKac. The island opened to the public in 2011. The planned ¬£256m complex is intended to combine commercial and residential properties with the restoration of monuments that are protected by UNESCO. While very similar to the plans made by Fosters + Partners in 2006,. the firm WORKac designed the new island as a microcosm of St-Petersburg, a concept of \\"city within the city\\". A branch of the Centre of Contemporary Art (based in Moscow) is also planned. In 2016, the restoration of the former blacksmith building (the foundry), the administrative building (the commandant‚Äôs house) and the old naval prison was launched. A playground and a communal herb garden were also planned. An ice skating rink was planned to be installed during winters on the central lawn. Those new additions are to be completed by 2025.

It was premiered on 19 January 2008 in Glasgow with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Scottish Opera Chorus, Glasgow University Chapel Choir and The Edinburgh Singers.Gasser, M., \\"Ronald Stevenson, Composer-Pianist : An Exegetical Critique from a Pianistic Perspective\\" (Edith Cowan University Press, Western Australia, 2013) References Munros Mountains and hills of the Southern Highlands Marilyns of Scotland Mountains and hills of Argyll and Bute One-thousanders of the British Isles ","title":"Beinn Dorain"},{"id":"6372035","text":"Arthur Paul Dean, Baron Dean of Harptree, PC (14 September 1924 ‚Äì 1 April 2009) was a British Conservative Party politician. Early life and Second World War Paul Dean was born in Northwich, Cheshire, England, on 14 September 1924, and was educated at Ellesmere College and Exeter College, Oxford. He served with the Welsh Guards during the Second World War, being commissioned in that regiment on 28 January 1944, with the service number of 307877. He fought with the regiment's 2nd Battalion, part of the Guards Armoured Division under Major General Allan Adair, in the Battle of Normandy where he was wounded. Shortly after the end of World War II in Europe Dean served in Germany with the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) as aide-de-camp (ADC) to the General Officer Commanding (GOC) I Corps, initially Lieutenant- General Sir John Crocker and then Lieutenant-General Sidney Kirkman before Lieutenant-General Ivor Thomas took over from September 1945. Dean retired from the army in 1949. Political career In 1962 Dean was the Conservative candidate in a by-election for the very safe Labour seat of Pontefract; he was defeated by Joseph Harper. He was Member of Parliament for North Somerset from 1964 to 1983, and after boundary changes, for Woodspring from 1983 until his retirement in 1992, preceding Liam Fox. Dean was a junior minister for Health and Social Security during the 1970-1974 Conservative government. From 1982 until his retirement, he was a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons firstly under George Thomas and then Bernard Weatherill. He was knighted in the 1985 New Year Honours. When in the chair of the Commons on 21 June 1990, Dean was required to use his casting vote. House of Lords On 12 October 1993 he was created a life peer as Baron Dean of Harptree, of Wedmore in the County of Somerset.

The name was erected as a genus of pterosaur and became a 'wastebasket taxon' for British Jurassic pterosaur remains until a recent revision. Rhamphocephalus comprises several named species, two of which are pterosaurian, but the type species - \\"R. prestwichi\\" - is based on remains now identified as a thalattosuchian. Because it is poorly preserved and lacks features that distinguish it from other thalattosuchians, \\"R. prestwichi\\" is considered an invalid species and the genus Rhamphocephalus is a nomen dubium. Reassessments of other \\"Rhamphocephalus\\" species suggest they are also undiagnostic to species level, although they have properties allowing referral to some Jurassic pterosaur groups. Taxonomy The type species, \\"R. prestwichi\\", is known from the skull roof fragment OUM J.28266, found the Kineton Thorns Quarry, Stow-On-Wold, Gloucestershire. Seeley (1880) noted that the cranial bones of \\"Rhamphocephalus\\" are arranged more like that of a crocodyliform rather than a pterosaur.Seeley H.G. 1880. On Rhamphocephalus prestwichi Seeley, an Ornithosaurian from the Stonesfield Slate of Kineton. Quart. J. Geol. Soc. 36: 27-30 Although assigned to Pterosauria by previous authors, in their review of pterosaur remains from the Great Oolite group, O'Sullivan and Martill (2018) demonstrated that \\"Rhamphocephalus\\" belongs to Thalattosuchia rather than Pterosauria due to differences with pterosaurs in the cranial bone arrangement. They also argued that the specimen lacked good autapomorphoes and the genus was a nomen dubium.Michael O‚ÄôSullivan; David M. Martill (2018). \\"Pterosauria of the Great Oolite Group (Bathonian, Middle Jurassic) of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, England\\". Acta Palaeontologica Polonica.

Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London 15:658-670. both based on jaw material, were previously assigned to Rhamphocephalus, along with the nominal species Pterodactylus aclandi, P. duncani, and P. kiddi, which are based on phalangeal remains. However, the thalattosuchian reclassification of Rhamphocephalus rendered this referral untenable, although bucklandii and depressirostris were clearly pterosaurian, and P. bucklandii was assigned to Rhamphorhychinae indeterminate, while Rhamphorhynchus depressirostris was assigned to ?Scaphognathinae indeterminate.

The genus has a circum-Mediterranean distribution, ranging from the Irano-Turanian Region in the east to Morocco in the west. Cerinthe has been known since ancient times. An early reference to it is in John Gerard's The Herbal, published in 1597, describing its appearance, growth habits, time of blooming and mentions that \\"there is a taste as if it were of new wax in the floures [sic] or leaves chewed, as the name doth seeme [sic] to import.\\" Gerard gives a list of other names for Cerinthe applied by prior writers, including Avicenna \\"Auicen\\", Pliny the Elder, Conrad Gessner, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, and Matthias de l'Obel.

He graduated from Fox Tech High School in 1966. He then joined the United States Air Force, where he was stationed in The Netherlands. In 1969, he was transferred to Laredo, Texas, where he was reborn a Chicano and began to get involved in political and community issues. He was honorably discharged from his military duties in 1971. He returned to San Antonio, where he attended San Antonio College and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from St. Mary's University in 1974. Career He ran for State Representative in 1974, under the Raza Unida Party. He authored several books of poetry including Pensamientos Capturados (1977), ¬°A MI QUE!

Best known for his satirical take on the Texas Sesquicentennial, \\"What the Sasquash-centennial Means To Me!\\" (1986). His editor at ViAztlan was Rafael C. Castillo, a prominent writer and mentor to many Chicano writers. Jose at first balked at the massive editorial changes to his poem, but later acquiesced to them after Castillo explained the scope and focus of the poetic changes. The poem led to loss of city grant funding for the Chicano Arts journal, \\"ViAztlan\\". During the 1980s, he became known to the Chicano world as The Black Hat Poet, the bearded Resistol cowboy hat-wearing, beer-drinking poet who wore starched blue jeans and a lizard earring, not the mental picture of what comes to mind when one thinks of a Chicano. Audiences especially enjoyed the humor in his writing and performances. Death He was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in July 1990 and battled his disease for three years. In addition to receiving traditional medical treatment, he pursued his own alternative treatment regimen consisting of vitamins, herbs, and a vegetarian diet. He died August 15, 1994 at the age of forty-seven. Bibliography *Pensamientos Capturados (1971) *¬°A MI QUE!

He was educated at the university of his native city, where he became privatdozent. During this period he edited, in collaboration with N. F. S. Grundtvig, the Theologisk Maanedskrift (13 vols., 1825 sqq.), and in 1829 was called to the pastorate of Glauchau, Saxony, where he powerfully aided religious awakening and revolt against the rationalism of the period, though at the same time he opposed any formal separation from the Lutheran Church. In 1830 he aided in founding the Muldenthal pastoral conference, but opposition gradually developed against him, largely on account of his uncompromising Lutheranism, and in 1845 he gladly resigned his pastorate and returned to Denmark. From 1846 to 1848 he lectured at the University of Copenhagen on dogmatics and introduction, but the death of his royal patron in the latter year exposed him to the attacks of those who regarded him as a German and a traitor. He accordingly accepted a call to the pastorate of Slagelse, where he passed the remainder of his life.

Life Horne was born on 1 January 1848, in Campsie, Stirlingshire, the son of Janet (n√©e Braid) and James Horne of Newmill, a farmer. He was educated at the High School, Glasgow, and the University of Glasgow where he studied under Lord Kelvin. He left university without graduating at the age on 19. In 1867 he joined the Scottish Branch of HM Geological Survey as an assistant and became an apprentice to Ben Peach. The two soon became good friends and collaborators. Horne was involved in mapping the Central Lowlands. Horne was a logical thinker and writer, complementing Peach's skills of resolving the internal structure of mountains by looking at the surface rocks. Thia approach allowed them to resolve a long- running debate on the geological formation of the Highlands. After their work in the Highlands, Horne and Peach wrote 'Northwest Highlands Memoir' in 1907. The work is regarded as one of the most important geological memoirs. Horne wrote most of the memoir himself. From 1901 until 1911, John Horne was the Director of the Scottish Branch of the Survey. Horne was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1881, upon the proposal of Sir Archibald Geikie, Sir Charles Wyville Thomson, Peter Tait and Robert Gray, and won the Society's Neill Prize for 1889-92. Horne was very active in the affairs of the RSE and served as Councillor (1902-5; 1906-7; 1914‚Äì15), Vice-President (1907‚Äì13) and President (1915-19). Horne was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1900 and was a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. He also served as President of the Edinburgh Geological Society. In later life he lived at 12 Keith Crescent in Blackhall, Edinburgh.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1911-12. He died on 30 May 1928 in Edinburgh. Family He was married to Anna Leyland Taylor (d. 1926). He was grandfather to the psychologist Thomas Arthur Munro.

Uplawmoor is the first settlement on this 'Lochlibo Road' to the north and Burnhouse is to the south. The settlement lies on the Lugton Water which forms the boundary between East Ayrshire and East Renfrewshire as well as that of the parishes of Dunlop and Beith.  History  In the 1830s the village consisted of only four houses: the hotel or inn, the smithy, and two toll houses. In 1845 the New Statistical Account records six other houses where spiritous liquors were sold. The road up from Uplawmoor was called the Lochlibo Road on the 1860s OS. The Lugton Inn was sadly destroyed by fire in the early 2000s. The name 'Lugton' is not marked on Timothy Pont's map of 1604.Pont, Timothy (1604). Cuninghamia. Pub. Blaeu in 1654.

Thomson's 1820 map marks a 'Keepers Cottage' which may have been on the main entrance drive running to the main road. The Paraffin Lamp Inn is not marked on the 1860 OS, however it is present on the 1895 edition. It appears to have been called the 'Paraffin Lamp' for many years, prior to which it was a private dwelling with outbuildings. It had a piggery and smokehouse and when it became an inn the dwelling house continued its use as a private home. The old site of Halket Loch lies not far away, once located near the various Halket Farms and that of Lochridgehills Farm. Turnpike Lugton was on two toll roads or turnpikes; one going to Kilmarnock and Ayr and the other to Irvine. The Glasgow by Lugton, to Kilmarnock, Irvine and Ayr turnpike was completed in 1820 at the cost of ¬£18,000.Pride, David (1910). A History of the Parish of Neilston. Pub. Alexander Gardner, Paisley. P. 109. The tollhouse on the Kilmarnock road stood opposite the stationmaster's house for Lugton station, the other still stands at the back of the site of the old Lugton Inn.

The termination Durr is supposed by some to be of Celtic origin and may refer to 'black' or 'water'.Local History Dictionary } The name 'turnpike' originated from the original 'gate' used being just a simple wooden bar attached at one end to a hinge on the supporting post. The hinge allowed it to 'open' or 'turn' This bar looked like the 'pike' used as a weapon in the army at that time and therefore we get 'turnpike'. The term was also used by the military for barriers set up on roads specifically to prevent the passage of horses. In addition to providing better surfaces and more direct routes, the turnpikes settled the confusion of the different lengths given to miles,Thomson, John (1828). A Map of the Northern Part of Ayrshire. which varied from 4,854 to nearly . Long miles, short miles, Scotch or Scot's miles (5,928 ft), Irish miles (6,720 ft), etc. all existed. seems to have been an average! Another important point is that when these new toll roads were constructed the turnpike trusts went to a great deal of trouble to improve the route of the new road and these changes could be quite considerable as the old roads tended to go from farm to farm, hardly the shortest route. The tolls on roads were abolished in 1878 to be replaced by a road 'assessment', which was taken over by the county council in 1889. Most milestones are no longer in-situ and often the only remaining clue is an otherwise unexplained 'kink' in the line of a hedgerow. The milestones were buried during the Second World War so as not to provide assistance to invading troops, German spies, etc.Wilson, Jenny (2006). Oral communication with Griffith, R.S.Ll. This seems to have happened all over Scotland, however Fife was more fortunate than Ayrshire, for the stones were taken into storage and put back in place after the war had finished.Stephen, Walter M.

Merry & Cunninghame, Ironmasters, built a row of houses for 200 people. John Cunninghame, at one point the sole proprietor, developed his business by taking loans out against the 'Lands of Chapeltoun', his home. He later became bankrupt and the estate was sequestered.Chapeltoun Mains Archive (2007) - legal documents of the 'Lands of Chapelton' from 1709 onwards. A brickworks was later established near Netherton farm at Horners Corner in the Castlewat plantation to use up the blaes bing produced in the mining of the iron ore, which had ceased in around 1900, but it in turn closed in 1921.Milligan, Susan.

A lime works had existed near Lugton as far back as 1829: it is shown on Aitken's map of Cunninghgame. A modern lime works was more recently established at the top of the belt of limestone, now worked out, by Reid of Halket and later sold to R. Howie & Sons in 1947.Strawhorn, John and Boyd, William (1951). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland. Ayrshire. Limestone is now brought to the site from elsewhere and the finished lime is used by farmers, in tarmacadam, previously in the manufacture of pig iron, etc. It had been used as 'Davy Dust' to help settle the coal dust in the mines. Jamieson records that the inn at Burnhouse was nicknamed the 'Trap 'Em Inn', the one at Lugton was called the 'Lug 'Em Inn', that at Auchentiber the 'Cleek 'Em Inn', and finally the one at Torranyard was called the 'Turn 'Em Out.'Jamieson, Shiela (1997).

Waterland corn mill on the Lugton Water is still marked on the 1895 map, with Tree Well nearby. Highgate wauk mill still survives as a dwelling (2007). A creamery was opened in 1919, dispatching milk to Glasgow by train and making cheese which was matured at the manager's house; also known as \\"Jeely Jocks\\" when jams were made from turnips and other vegetables during the first world war.

Transport It was once served by two railway stations, both of which are now closed. Lugton railway station was on the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway's line, opening in 1871 and closed to passengers in 1966. The best known porter at Lugton station was local lady Peggy Speirs of Burnside Cottages.

Landmarks='Lugton Hall' or Church A small mission hall or church, also serving as a public hall, used to exist near the railway bridge until the 1980s, having been moved from its previous site near the old brickworks. It had two commodious ante-rooms, electric power and even central heating as early as 1935. Services were held fortnightly. The Lugton Discussion Society also held its meetings here. The building, a typical 'kit build' corrugated iron structure, survived until the 1990s, having gone out of use in the 1960s.Dunlop Ancient & Modern. An Exhibition. March 1998. Editor.

Only one tower remained as a prominent landmark after the times of the Covenanters and today's (2007) surviving tower is this same remnant. A new mansion house was built around 1712 by William Mure on the lands of Ramshead, however the present Robert Adam designed house was built by his son, William 'Baron Mure' about lower down from the original. Caldwell House was the Mure family home until 1909. Antiquities A Buckler found at Lugtonridge in 1770. In about 1770 half a dozen bronze bucklers (small shields) were dug out of a moss on Lugton ridge. They were found about down and were arranged in a circle. One was preserved, measuring nearly in diameter, with a semi-globular 'umbo' or 'boss' being just over in diameter. It is highly ornamented, with twenty nine concentric rings with intervening ribs.Smith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. Pub. Elliot Stock. P. 81 - 82.  The Lugton Water  This rivulet runs from Loch Libo (395 feet above sea-level) through Neilston, Beith, Dunlop, Stewarton, and Kilwinning parishes, until having passed through Eglinton Country Park it runs into the Garnock, 2 and a half miles north by west of Irvine town. It contains fresh-water and sea-trout and the occasional salmon. Pont refers to it as the 'Ludgar' or 'Lugdurr' Loch Libo in the 14th century was referred to as Loch le Bog Syde in a charter, meaning the Bogside Loch.Paterson, James (1863-66).

Early life and education Burgess was born in Maghull in the United Kingdom to English parents. He grew up in Bloxham, a small village in Oxfordshire from the age of 5‚Äì18, attending Bloxham Primary School, Warriner Secondary School and Banbury Upper School. He studied astrophysics at the (then) School of Physics at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, where he later switched to pure Physics and then Theoretical Physics for his bachelor's degree. He stayed on to obtain a Doctor of Philosophy in Theoretical Physics in Newcastle, in the field of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories, for which he received the Runcorn Prize. Burgess pursued a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Oslo in Norway, where he later became the first professor with a title in Network and System administration. While at the University of Oslo he developed an interest in the behaviour of computers as dynamic systems and began to apply ideas from physics to describe computer behaviour. Burgess is perhaps best known as the author of the popular configuration management software package CFEngine, but has also made important contributions to the theory of the field of automation and policy based management, including the idea of operator convergence and promise theory.  Contributions to Computer Science  Burgess has made contributions to theoretical and empirical computer science, mainly in the area of the behaviour of computing infrastructure and services.M. Burgess, website In the early 1990s, Burgess asserted that programmatic models of computer programs could not describe observed behaviour at the macroscopic scale, and that statistical physics could be used instead, thus likening artificial systems to a quasi-natural phenomenon.M. Burgess, In Search of Certainty, XtAxis Press, 2013 With the increasing interest in the role of information in physics, Burgess has argued that computer science and physics can be bridged using the concepts of promise theory, through the notion of semantic spacetime, a description of functional aspects of spacetime at multiple scales, which offers an alternative to Robin Milner's theory of bigraphs.  Configuration  In 1993, Burgess introduced the software CFEngine based in intuitions and practice, focusing on the idea of repeatable desired end-state 'convergence', to manage system configuration. The term convergence, used by Burgess, is now often inaccurately just called idempotence, as convergence in his meaning implied both desired end-state and idempotence of an error correction operator at the desired end-state. Shifting interest from Theoretical Physics to Computer Science, Burgess then began to explore the ad hoc choices initially made, and set out to find a scientific method for understanding such choices in computing systems.  Computer Immunology, Anomaly Detection, and Machine Learning  Following a position paper 'manifesto' pointing out the research challenges needed to make self- repairing systems,Computer Immunology USENIX LISA conference, 1998 Burgess undertook to study computer systems as a number of empirical phenomena, taking an approach based on physics to learn first about the scales and patterns. The idea of self-healing, or self-maintaining systems was originally referred to as Computer Immunology, as it was inspired by research into the Danger model of human immune systems. The empirical studies were published in various formats between 1999 and 2003, culminating in a journal summary review,Measuring system normality ACM Transactions on Computing Systems 20, p.125-160 and a more practical method for automated machine learning of system behavioural characters.M. Burgess, Two dimensional time-series for anomaly detection and regulation in adaptive systems, in Proceedings of 13th IFIP/IEEE International Workshop on Distributed System, operations and management (DSOM 2002) This incorporated the idea of so-called exponential smoothing (which was called a geometric average) for fast learning, along with a two-dimensional, cylindrical time modelM.

Burgess, Thermal, non-equilibrium phase space for networked computers, Phys. Rev. E (2000)62:1738M. Burgess, The kinematics of distributed computing, Int. J. Mod Phys. C12 759‚Äì789 (2001) The notion of an equilibrium or steady state operation thus became the baseline, replacing arbitrary thresholds used in the monitoring software of the day. The software CFEngine became the proof of concept platform using these methods for system state anomaly detection, from 2002 to the present, and received widespread use.  Theoretical models  Based on these fundamental empirical studies, Burgess argued for two kinds of theoretical model to describe systems, which he called type 1 and type 2.M. Burgess, Theoretical System Administration, USENIX LISA Conference proceedings 2000 Type 1 models were dynamical performance models that described machines as changing phenomena. Type 2 were semantic models, concerning the efficacy and influence of human decisions on behaviour, called policy, or desired-state computing. He later developed these further and made connection with Claude Shannon's work on error correction in a paper discussing how separation of timescales plays an important role in computer science, by analogy with physics. With Trond Reitan, Burgess showed that the question of when was the optimal time to backup data could be answered scientifically. The studies carried out between 1998 and 2002 led to a monograph Analytical Network and System Administration: Managing Human-Computer Systems.Mark Burgess, Analytical Network and System Administration: Managing Human-Computer Systems, J. Wiley and Sons, 2004 Although quite comprehensive about some aspects of systems, Burgess identified a missing piece to the story, namely how to describe distributed co-operation between computers in networks. This prompted later work, which became Promise Theory,J.A. Bergstra and M. Burgess, Promise Theory: Principles and Applications, XtAxis press 2014 proposed at the Distributed Systems, Operations and Management conference in Barcelona in 2005.M. Burgess, An Approach to Understanding Policy Based on Autonomy and Voluntary Cooperation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3775, 2005, pp 97‚Äì108 The computer science community has had a mixed response to the hybrid nature of the infrastructure work, which seemed to view as being somewhere between traditional computing and physics. However, by now it has become almost ubiquitous, and its approaches and results are in general use.  Promise theory  Promise theory was introduced as a model of voluntary co- operation between agents, in 2004, for understanding human-computer systems with complex interactions, and was later developed with Dutch computer scientist and friend Jan Bergstra into a book. Interest in promise theory has grown in the IT industry, with several products citing it.Thinking in Promises, O'Reilly, 2015Promise Theory: Can you really trust the network to keep promises?Why you need to know about promise theoryOpFlex-ing Your Cisco Application Centric InfrastructureThe Quest to Make Code Work Like Biology Just Took A Big Step (Wired 2016)  Semantic spacetime  As an application of promise theory, which makes contact with knowledge representation and artificial reasoning, Burgess introduced the concept of semantic spacetime, which applies semantics to graph theoretical models of connected regions, from computer networks to smart cities.Semantic Spacetimes: Formalizing the semantics of space and time, for cognition and measurement (a route to knowledge representation)  Graph Theoretical ideas  Another recurring theme of Burgess's work has been graph theory. Working with search engine researchers Geoffrey Canright and Knut Eng√∏ Monsen, Burgess developed a page ranking algorithm similar to PageRank eigenvalue sink remedies in directed graphs.Mining Topological Importance From The Eigenvectors Of Directed Graphs (2007) This work also met with resistance from the American journal establishment, and was delayed before final publication.J. Bjelland, M. Burgess, G. Canright and K.

He was a right- handed batsman, and bowled right-arm off-breaks. He played in New Zealand's first One Day International (ODI). He was raised in the Auckland suburb of Remuera and attended Remuera Intermediate School. Between 1958 and 1963 he attended Auckland Grammar School, where he showed his talent as a natural sportsman by becoming a member of both the cricket and soccer 1st Elevens for several years. During the 1970s, the decade when Burgess played most of his international cricket and before the advent of professional sport in New Zealand, sportsmen were required to support themselves and take unpaid leave to complete overseas tours. In the mid-1970s he joined the staff of a leading Auckland sportsgoods wholesaler, Brittain Wynyard & Co. Ltd. Beginning as a sales representative, he became promotions manager of the company. His father Gordon Burgess played for Auckland between 1940‚Äì41 and 1954‚Äì55Gordon Burgess at Cricket Archive and managed the New Zealand team that toured England, India and Pakistan in 1969. Cricket career in the 1960s Burgess made his first- class debut for a New Zealand Under-23 XI against Auckland in 1963‚Äì64 at the age of 19. He played his first matches in the Plunket Shield for Auckland in 1966‚Äì67, scoring 270 runs at 33.75 in six matches. It was enough to secure his selection for the short non-Test tour of Australia in 1967‚Äì68, and the four Tests against India that followed in New Zealand, when he scored three fifties and was the second-highest-scoring New Zealander with 271 runs at 33.87. He made his first first-class century, 102, shortly afterwards in April 1968 when he played two matches in India with several other international players to raise money for the Koyna Relief Fund. He made two more centuries for Auckland in the 1968‚Äì69 season, but was not successful in two Tests against the West Indies. Nevertheless, he was selected to tour England, India and Pakistan in 1969. He had little success in England, and after the First Test in India he had played nine Tests for 368 runs at 21.65 and one wicket. But in the Second Test in Nagpur, on a turning pitch, he made 89 (the highest score in the match) and 12, and took 3 for 23 and 1 for 18, as New Zealand's spinners (Burgess, Vic Pollard and Hedley Howarth) prevailed to take New Zealand to its first-ever victory in India, at the 11th try. He hit his first Test century in the following series in Pakistan. New Zealand needed to win or draw the Third Test at Dacca to give the country its first overseas series victory against any opponent. Burgess hit 59 in the first innings. After losing eight wickets for 101 in the second innings New Zealand was only 84 ahead and apparently heading for defeat, but Burgess scored 119 not out, in an eventual total of 200, putting on 96 for the ninth wicket with Bob Cunis. According to Wisden Burgess \\"gave a magnificent display\\" over four and a quarter hours.Wisden 1971, p. 864. Cricket career in the 1970s When he scored centuries against England in Auckland in 1970‚Äì71 and against the West Indies in Kingston in 1971‚Äì72 he achieved the rare feat of centuries in three consecutive Tests, even if they were spaced over two and a half years. He hit further Test centuries against England at Lord's in 1973, and against Pakistan in Lahore in 1976‚Äì77. Burgess captained New Zealand in 10 of his 50 Tests. During his term as captain, New Zealand only won one Test, his first as captain, in Wellington in 1977‚Äì78, but it was an important victory, the first ever by New Zealand over England, in the 48th Test between the two countries. He also captained New Zealand in the 1979 World Cup, when they reached the semi-finals but lost to England by nine runs. He played his last Test against Australia at Melbourne in 1980‚Äì81, scoring 49 and 10 not out under the captaincy of Geoff Howarth, who had succeeded him. He hit 134 against Tasmania in the next match, and retired from first-class cricket at the end of the tour, at the age of 36. The highest of his 20 first-class centuries was 146 for Auckland against Central Districts at Auckland in 1971‚Äì72. Despite his success at Nagpur in 1969‚Äì70, afterwards he seldom bowled in Tests, and only occasionally in first- class matches. Christopher Martin-Jenkins summed him up as \\"a fair-haired right-hander with a sound technique and some handsome attacking strokes, especially adept at driving\\", and says of his captaincy and overall attitude to cricket, \\"he was popular with both his own team and his opponents. Essentially a dedicated amateur cricketer in a professional age, his attitude was that winning or losing was not life or death.\\"C. Martin-Jenkins, The Complete Who's Who of Test Cricketers, Rigby, 1983, p. 378. Football Burgess was named New Zealand Footballer of the Year in 1965. He played regularly for the New Zealand national under-23 football team from 1965 to 1967, scoring 1 goal in his 7 appearances and played one game for the New Zealand national football team in an unofficial match against a touring Manchester United side in 1967. He later served on the New Zealand Soccer council for over thirty years.

It is one of two public law schools in the Chicago area. The College of Law was founded as the Lewis University College of Law in Glen Ellyn, Illinois in 1975. It became part of Northern Illinois University in August 1979, and in 1982 moved to the DeKalb, Illinois campus, taking up residence in Swen Parson Hall, the former NIU main library. The College of Law offers the Juris Doctor degree. According to NIU Law's 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 60% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long- term, bar passage-required employment nine months after graduation (57.1% when excluding sole practitioners). According to the National Association of Law Placement employment report, 89% of the NIU Law Class of 2017 were employed as of ten months after graduation. Employment According to NIU Law's 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 60% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long- term, bar passage-required employment nine months after graduation (57.1% when excluding sole practitioners). Nine months after graduation, 75.7% of the NIU Law Class of 2017 was employed in full-time, long-term, J.D. advantage, bar passage required, or professional positions. According to the National Association of Law Placement employment report, 89% of the NIU Law Class of 2017 were employed as of ten months after graduation. NIU Law's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 17.1%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2017 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non- professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. Costs The cost of tuition and fees at the NIU College of Law for the 2018-2019 academic year is $22,180 for all U.S. residents, whether in-state or out-of-state. (In contrast, the average tuition for other Illinois law schools in 2018 was more than $42,000.). The cost for tuition and fees for international students for 2018-2019 is $38,435. The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at NIU College of Law for the 2018-2019 academic year is $44,142 for all U.S. residents. Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years for students starting in 2019 is $154,146. The average debt load for graduates in the Class of 2018 who borrowed at least one loan was $95,247. The national average debt load for law students in 2017 was $112,776. Students can obtain a significant amount of financial assistance through the university and law school in the form of research and graduate assistantships, the latter of which typically provides a full tuition waiver as well as a stipend. Legal skills training In the first three semesters of law school, NIU College of Law students take a pair of two-semester required courses, Basic Legal Research and Legal Writing and Advocacy. The two courses employ coordinated, real-life exercises. In Basic Legal Research, students learn to use both print and computer-assisted legal research tools. Students analyze a factual situation in order to develop a legal research strategy and learn how to locate and use secondary sources, case law, statutory and legislative history material, and administrative regulations. In Legal Writing and Advocacy, students develop skills through a series of intensive writing exercises culminating in an oral argument. In Introduction to Lawyering Skills, students learn skills and techniques essential to the pretrial phase of a civil or criminal lawsuit. The course involves simulated experiences, including role- playing and videotaping, to provide immediacy of experience and direct feedback. Clinics and Experiential Education Various clinical experiences are offered each semester at the Clinical Law Center on the DeKalb campus and the Zeke Giorgi Legal Clinic in Rockford, Illinois. In addition, in 2013 the College of Law began a clinical partnership with Hesed House and Aunt Martha's Health Center in Aurora, Illinois that focuses on the legal issues that may contribute to health problems in the area‚Äôs indigent population. At these clinics, students represent clients under the direction of well-qualified supervising attorneys. The clinical courses each have a classroom component in addition to the practice experience. They are taught by members of the College of Law faculty in conjunction with the supervising attorneys. These classes bring academic and practical worlds together, addressing a range of issues students experience in their cases, from honing legal skills, to exploring issues of substantive law and procedure, to considering real-world issues of professional responsibility and ethics. Clinical opportunities * Civil Justice Clinic * Criminal Defense Clinic * Health Advocacy Clinic Prisoners' Rights Project  The Prisoners' Rights Project was initiated in 2018 in partnership with the P. Michael Mahoney Chapter of the Federal Bar Association. Over the course of two semesters, third-year students represent prisoners in federal court who have alleged that their constitutional rights have been violated. Each case is chosen with the expectation that it will culminate in a federal jury trial where the students will be lead counsel. Public interest service In 2017, law.com recognized NIU College of Law as one of the top law schools for delivering graduates to public service careers. and in 2015 preLaw recognized NIU Law specifically in the category of best schools for prosecutors/public defenders.

History  The NIU College of Law was founded as the Lewis University College of Law on November 2, 1974.Monat, William R. The Achieving Institution: A Presidential Perspective on Northern Illinois University. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University, 2001. Pg. 110. Due to a lack of funding to meet ABA requirements, the Lewis University administration began looking for an institution to transfer the law school to. Administrators from both NIU and Lewis University initially met in 1978 to discuss the transfer of the law school from Lewis University to NIU.Monat, William R. The Achieving Institution: A Presidential Perspective on Northern Illinois University. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University, 2001. Pg. 108. Although there had been talk for quite some time of establishing a law school at NIU there had yet to be any real progress made. NIU and Lewis University began working on a proposal to submit to the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) in 1979. The IBHE rejected the proposal necessitating legislative action. Illinois Senators David C. Shapiro and Philip J. Rock introduced Senate Bill 719 on April 12, 1979 to the Illinois Senate.Monat, William R. The Achieving Institution: A Presidential Perspective on Northern Illinois University. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University, 2001. Pg. 126. Senate Bill 719 provided the legislation necessary for the law school transfer of jurisdiction from Lewis University to NIU and funding to support the law school at NIU. After passing in the Illinois General Assembly, Senate Bill 719 was approved by Governor Thompson on June 26, 1979 and signed into law as Public Act 81‚Äì37 the next day.Monat, William R. The Achieving Institution: A Presidential Perspective on Northern Illinois University. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University, 2001. Pg. 132. Effective August 1, 1979, Lewis University College of Law would become Northern Illinois University College of Law. In the Fall of 1982, after more than 7 years in Glen Ellyn, the NIU College of Law moved into its newly remodeled space within Swen Parson Hall on NIU‚Äôs main campus in DeKalb, IL.Monat, William R.

The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with U.S. Route 11 (US 11) in Pamelia, Jefferson County. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with US 11, NY 11B, and NY 30 in Malone, Franklin County. In between the termini, NY 37 passes through Ogdensburg and Massena. It is a two-lane, nondivided, full access roadway for most of its entire length, except for portions between Massena and western Franklin County, where the route widens to a four-lane divided highway. NY 37 was assigned in 1930 to the portion of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway between Redwood and Malone as well as to a previously unnumbered roadway between Watertown and Redwood. The Redwood‚ÄìMalone portion was originally part of NY 3 when the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. NY 37 has since been rerouted in areas, primarily near Ogdensburg and Massena. Route description=Watertown to Ogdensburg NY 37 begins at an intersection with US 11 just north of Watertown in the town of Pamelia. Between Watertown and Theresa, NY 37 follows a north-south alignment and parallels Interstate 81 (I-81), located just west of NY 37\\\\. Southwest of Theresa, I-81 turns to the northwest as NY 37 intersects NY 26 and NY 411, the westward continuation of NY 26\\\\. NY 26 joins NY 37 around the western edge of the village before splitting to the northwest a short distance to the north. NY 37, however, continues northward, passing through Redwood before curving northeast as it enters St. Lawrence County. NY 37 eastbound in Pamelia Across the county line, NY 37 parallels NY 12 to the north as both routes proceed northeast. Roughly from the county line, NY 37 encounters Hammond, a small village located west of Black Lake. Past Hammond, Route 37 heads north toward Morristown, where it meets NY 12, the primary roadway along the St. Lawrence River's southern bank west of this point. NY 12 ends here; however, NY 37 takes over the routing of NY 12 and proceeds northeast along the edge of the St. Lawrence River. Just east of NY 12, NY 37 meets the northernmost point of NY 58. Midway between Morristown and Ogdensburg, NY 37 enters St. Lawrence State Park, one of many New York state parks located on the southern bank of the river. The route exits the park and heads northeast to Ogdensburg, where it meets NY 68 (the former routing of NY 37 into Ogdensburg) west of the city. While NY 68 continues into downtown, NY 37 turns eastward, then northeastward and bypasses the city to the south. Near the Ogdensburg International Airport, NY 37 meets NY 812 at an interchange. Here, NY 812 joins NY 37 and the two routes intersect NY 68 once more before leaving Ogdensburg. Ogdensburg to Massena Just outside Ogdensburg, NY 812 separates from NY 37 to continue northward to Canada over the Ogdensburg‚ÄìPrescott International Bridge, where it becomes Highway 16 farther inland. NY 37, however, continues to follow the south bank of the St. Lawrence River, passing Galop Island State Park on its way to Waddington, where it intersects the northernmost point on NY 345\\\\. East of the village, NY 37 passes south of the riverside Coles Creek State Park and traverses Coles Creek itself. In the Louisville hamlet of Louisville Corner (west of Massena), NY 37 departs the St. Lawrence River and intersects the western end of NY 131, a northerly bypass of Massena along the riverbank. Farther east in Massena, NY 37 intersects NY 37B, the former routing of NY 37 through Massena, west of the village before crossing over the Grasse River and intersecting the northern termini of both NY 56 (where NY 37 widens into a four-lane divided highway) and NY 420\\\\. NY 37B later rejoins NY 37 east of the village, as does NY 131 directly north of the Massena International Airport. Eastern St. Lawrence and Franklin counties Eastern terminus of NY 37 in Malone East of the airport in the town of Massena, NY 37 begins to parallel the north bank of the Raquette River as it intersects NY 37C near a hamlet named for the waterway. NY 37 and the river continue northeast to the vicinity of the hamlet of Rooseveltown, where NY 37 formerly connected to a large traffic circle linking NY 37 to the Three Nations Crossing as well as County Route 45 (CR 45). The traffic circle has since been replaced with a T-intersection and traffic light because of the expansion of the American Customs facility. Upon crossing into Franklin County and the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation a short distance to the east, the road narrows back to a two-lane undivided highway and crosses over the Raquette River. Although most of NY 37 in the town of Bombay is contained within the reservation, a short portion east of Hogansburg and the St. Regis River and west of Tarbell Road is located outside the reservation limits. Within this stretch, NY 37 meets both the eastern end of NY 37C and the northern terminus of NY 95\\\\. East of the reservation, NY 37 roughly parallels the CSX Transportation-owned Montreal Subdivision northeast to Fort Covington, where NY 37 crosses the railroad line and intersects Water Street (unsigned NY 970T), a connector to Quebec Route 132 on the northern side of the Canadian border. East of Fort Covington, NY 37 follows a more southeasterly routing as it separates from the northernmost extents of the state. In the Westville hamlet of Westville Center, NY 37 meets the western terminus of NY 122\\\\. Farther south, NY 37 enters the village of Malone, where it terminates at US 11, NY 11B and NY 30. History The portion of NY 37 from Redwood to Malone was originally part of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, an international auto trail connecting Portland, Maine, on the Atlantic Ocean coast to Portland, Oregon, east of the Pacific Ocean. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the entirety of the Roosevelt Highway in New York was designated NY 3. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 3 was rerouted to follow its current routing between Watertown and Plattsburgh. The former routing of NY 3 along the St. Lawrence River became part of the new NY 37, which utilized a previously unnumbered highway between Watertown and Redwood via Theresa. Initially, NY 37 directly served Theresa by way of modern CR 136, CR 46, and CR 193; however, it was realigned to bypass the village to the west. When NY 37 was first assigned, it entered Ogdensburg on Main Street (modern NY 68) and exited the city on Ford Street and Proctor Avenue. East of the city, NY 37 used less than of its modern alignment before turning south to follow Van Rensselaer Road to Waddington. The modern, riverside alignment of NY 37 between Ogdensburg and Waddington was designated as NY 37A as part of the 1930 renumbering. In the late 1950s, the alignments of NY 37 and NY 37A were flipped, placing NY 37 on its current routing and NY 37A on Van Rensselaer Road. During the same time period, NY 37 was rerouted to follow a new bypass around the southern edge of Ogdensburg. In the Massena area, NY 37 originally broke from its modern alignment west of the village and followed what is now NY 37B east to Main Street. Here, it turned south onto Main Street to traverse the Grasse River before continuing east on Orvis Street (and meeting modern NY 37B at Center Street) to reconnect to its current alignment east of the village. Lastly, from modern NY 131 adjacent to the Massena International Airport to Rooseveltown, NY 37 was initially routed on Trippany Road, NY 37C, and Roosevelt Road. In the mid-1950s, construction began on a new southern bypass of Massena that connected to NY 37 at the modern termini of NY 37B. It was completed and opened to traffic by 1958. Work on an eastward, divided highway extension of the bypass to Rooseveltown began . The final section, from the hamlet of Raquette River to Rooseveltown, opened to traffic later that year. Suffixed routes { \\"type\\": \\"ExternalData\\", \\"service\\": \\"page\\", \\"title\\": \\"New York State Route 37C.map\\" } { \\"type\\": \\"ExternalData\\", \\"service\\": \\"page\\", \\"title\\": \\"New York State Route 37D.map\\" } NY 37 once had as many as four suffixed routes; two have since been removed. *NY 37A was an alternate route of NY 37 between Ogdensburg and Waddington. It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to what is now NY 37 between the two locations. At the time, NY 37 was routed on Van Rensselaer Road. The alignments of NY 37 and NY 37A were flipped in the late 1950s. On April 10, 1980, the NY 37A designation was removed. Ownership and maintenance of Van Rensselaer Road was transferred from the state of New York to St. Lawrence County on September 1, 1982, at which time the highway was redesignated as CR 28. *NY 37B () is the former routing of NY 37 through Massena. NY 37B leaves NY 37 west of the village and rejoins its parent just east of Massena. It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering. *NY 37C () is a loop off of NY 37 in northeastern St. Lawrence County and northwestern Franklin County. While NY 37 follows a direct east‚Äìwest routing between Massena and the Bombay community of Hogansburg, NY 37C dips south to serve to the Brasher community of Helena. NY 37C was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering. *NY 37D was a spur connecting NY 37 to NY 26 in Theresa, utilizing part of NY 37's original alignment through the Theresa area. It was assigned and removed in the mid-1960s. It is now maintained by Jefferson County as CR 136 and CR 46.

One of six children, Preedy was born in Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh, India, where his father was serving with the Royal Artillery. The family returned to Eltham, London, in 1907 where he attended Gordon School. He began playing football as a youth, turning professional in 1924 with Third Division South Charlton Athletic, where he became the club's regular keeper and made 131 league appearances in four seasons. In a Football League Management Committee Meeting in May 1928, Preedy was removed from retained to transfer list. Preedy moved to Wigan Borough in 1928 and spent a single season there, playing 41 league matches, before moving to Arsenal in May 1929. He was not initially the Gunners' first team goalkeeper, instead mainly playing as understudy to Dan Lewis, Arsenal's regular keeper. Preedy made his Arsenal debut on 7 September 1929, against Sheffield Wednesday, and kept a clean sheet as Arsenal won 2‚Äì0. Preedy kept his place after that match but was dropped after a 2‚Äì5 defeat to Aston Villa in November. After that, he was often left out of the team in favour of Lewis, but after Lewis was injured in a 6‚Äì6 draw against Leicester City, Preedy was picked to play in the FA Cup Final against Huddersfield Town at Wembley Stadium. Preedy kept a clean sheet and Arsenal won the match 2‚Äì0 in front of 100,000 spectators, the first of Arsenal's many successes over the years. He was presented with his winner's medal by King George V. Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman was never happy with any of his goalkeepers and in an attempt to fill the role signed both Gerard Keizer and Bill Harper in the 1930 close season, and then Frank Moss a year later. Despite intense competition for the goalkeeper's place, Preedy made 25 appearances in the 1930-31 and 1931-32 seasons, but not enough to win a League Championship medal in the former. After an entire season spent as Moss's understudy, Preedy left Arsenal for Bristol Rovers in 1933, having played 40 matches for the Gunners. After a season with Rovers he moved to Luton Town and finished his career with non-league Margate in 1935. He then followed in the footsteps of his elder brother Jack, and became a London taxi driver. He died in 1978. References  External links  * Gunners Greatest 50 Moments at arsenal.com.

CED's Trustees consist primarily of senior corporate executives from a range of U.S. industries and sectors. CED's stated aims are to sustain and promote free enterprise, improve education and healthcare, reform campaign finance, enhance corporate governance, and improve the fiscal health of the United States.About CED  History  CED was founded in 1942 by a group of business leaders led by Paul G. Hoffman, president of Studebaker Corporation; William Benton, co- founder of Benton & Bowles advertising firm; and Marion B. Folsom, treasurer of Eastman Kodak Company. CED was first formed to help the U.S. economy transition from a wartime to peacetime economy. At the end of World War II, CED successfully worked to garner support among the American business community for the Marshall Plan. Since its inception, CED has aimed to promote policies that its trustees believe will foster economic growth and development to benefit all Americans. The organization conducts research and outreach efforts in the U.S. and abroad to change policy at the local, state, and national levels. In recent decades, CED has increased access to pre- kindergarten and college, advocated campaign finance reform nationally, placed more women in corporate leadership, and reduced government spending. In January 2015, the Committee for Economic Development merged with The Conference Board, given the many synergies between the two organizations.The Conference Board to Merge with the Committee for Economic Development Both are non-partisan, non-lobbying, and have trustees comprised mainly from the business community.  Leadership  CED's President-elect (effective September 2018) is Bernard Bailey. Prior to Bailey, the organization's president and CEO since 2013 was Steve Odland. Michael Petro is CED's Executive Vice President,Michael Petro and Joseph Minarik is the organization's senior vice president and director of research.Joseph Minarik  Principles  The organization's work is based on seven core principles: sustainable capitalism, long-term economic growth, efficient fiscal and regulatory policy, competitive and open markets, a globally competitive workforce, equal economic opportunity, and nonpartisanship in the nation's interest.  Policy research  CED conducts policy research in the following issue areas: fiscal health, education (including early childhood, K-12, and postsecondary), health care, campaign finance, women in corporate leadership, regulatory policy, immigration, infrastructure, and tax reform. CED aims to encourage American business leaders to take a more expansive view of their responsibilities by practicing what it calls \\"business statesmanship\\" ‚Äî recognizing that business leaders can promote societal health by engaging in and speaking out for the common good on timely public policy issues.

During his career as a goalkeeper, he played at high levels in the Norway Eliteserien (H√∏nefoss BK, Stab√¶k Fotball, Hamarkameratene, and Lillestr√∏m SK), Scotlish Premier League (Ayr United F.C. and Motherwell F.C.) and English Championship (Wrexham A.F.C.)). Most recently he has worked as Director, Deputy Technical Director and Goalkeeper Coach with various professional and national teams, including Major League Soccer clubs, the Vancouver Whitecaps and Minnesota United, and the national teams of Team Canada, Trinidad and Tobago FF.  Coaching  Rovde holds a UEFA 'A' goalkeeper \\"pro-license\\" and a KNVB Johan Cruyff Masters of Sports Management. In 2009, Rovde became director of goalkeepers for the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation Men and Woman's program, and also served as Deputy Technical Director for TTFF Woman's program. Rovde was a part of the U17 TTFF staff that was ranked No. 1 in CONCACAF, and No. 9 in FIFA World Rankings. His U17 goalkeeper was voted goalkeeper of the tournament in The U17 World Cup 2010 by FIFA. Rovde coached in four World Cup qualifiers for various Trinidad and Tobago teams. Rovde worked closely alongside coaching legend Even Pellerud as Pellerud's assistant and advisor for Team Canada. In 2011, Rovde became the new head goalkeeper Coach for the MLS franchise Vancouver Whitecaps FC, working with veteran MLS goalkeepers, Joe Cannon and Jay Nolly, receiving praise for extending Cannon's career as he went on to receive most clean sheets in the MLS 2012 season, and most minutes without conceding goals in the history of the league. Goalkeeper Brad Knighton was added to the 2012 squad and achieved the MLS goalkeeper of the month award and claimed double figures in clean sheets over the course of the season. Rovde's unique goalkeeper coaching style was instrumental in helping the Whitecaps be the first Canadian team to reach the MLS Playoffs. In 2013, Rovde recruited Danish goalkeeper David Ousted, who later achieved \\"MLS All-star\\" status twice. Ousted has said Rovde was the most influential goalkeeper coach in his career and a big part of his success in the MLS. Over three seasons Ousted achieved double figures in clean sheets and Whitecaps FC became the club in MLS with the most shutouts from 2012 to 2016. Ousted still holds the MLS record of minutes without conceding goals, surpassing Cannon. During his time with the Whitecaps FC, Rovde managed and directed the goalkeeper pathways program for the Youth Academy, producing six Canadian national team goalkeepers. Rovde was responsible for discovering goalkeeper Marco Carducci, who achieved \\"Player of the year\\" status two years in a row from the Canadian Soccer Association. Carducci captained Canada in the U17 World Cup. Canadian goalkeeper Simon Thomas, at one time released from Whitecaps FC, was reintroduced to the team by Rovde for two years as a training goalkeeper. Thomas earned a national men's first team game vs the United States Men's National Team in Houston in 2014 and is the only Canadian goalkeeper to have had a shutout vs USA in the last three decades. Simon Thomas went on to be a professional goalkeeper at the highest level in Norway and remains a regular on the Canadian men's national team. In recent years, Rovde has focused on clubs in the Vancouver area, and held pro-series goalkeeper camps with the Whitecaps FC. These popular camps drew goalkeepers from across Canada. Directing the programs while mentoring and supporting young athletes, both male and female, to reach the best versions of themselves has been a focus and commitment from Rovde and many of his graduates have played on national teams and for professional clubs. After the 2016 season, Rovde was offered a new challenge with the then- new MLS franchise, Minnesota United FC. Rovde worked closely with Minnesota's sports director, Manny Lagos, recruiting goalkeepers to the club, including Swedish national team goalkeeper John Alvb√•ge, experienced MLS goalkeeper Bobby Shuttleworth, USL goalkeeper of the year Patrick MacLain, and Alex Kapp. Shuttleworth finished off the season as the No. 1 goalkeeper and was voted MNUFC best overall player voted by the fans. Continuing his commitment to youth development, Rovde was heavily involved in the Minnesota United FC's Youth Academy, where he scouted, recruited and trained the first youth US national U15 goalkeeper, Fred Emmings, locally. Rovde's Pro Series goalkeeper camp grew in popularity in Minnesota within a short period, and two academy goalkeepers were recruited out of the participants in those camps.  Professional development  Rovde spent 2018 in professional development, visiting top clubs in Norway, Denmark, Scotland, England, and the US and remains very involved in the local youth soccer community in Vancouver, Canada where he shares his experience with multiple youth clubs on a regular basis. Together with a small group of professional coaches from Houston, Seattle, Dallas and Colorado, Rovde was instrumental in founding an MLS goalkeeper coaches Union in 2017, and MLS and US Soccer's own goalkeeper Pro License program. Rovde suggested a minimum knowledge and experience requirement to become a MLS goalkeeping coach in order to raise standards and professionalism throughout the goalkeeper trade.  Sports management  On 4 February 2020, after a short spell as Goalkeeping Program Technical Lead at youth club Richmond FC, in the city of Richmond, British Columbia, Canada, Rovde was elevated to the role of Executive Director of the club.  Pop culture  In the video game FIFA 05, Rovde received a player score of 67, with a potential score of 77.

Chemical structure Plitidepsin is a cyclic depsipeptide, meaning it is a cyclic peptide in which there is one or more ester bond in place of one or more of a peptide bond. Its chemical structure is very close to that of didemnin B, the only difference being that the lactate residue in didemnin B is present in the oxidized pyruvate version.

Accessed 8 January 2014 and is also used by David and Charles Ltd as a UK and Europe distribution platform for the overseas acquired companies Krause Publications and Adams Media. Origins David and Charles Ltd, is a publisher of illustrated non-fiction books and provider of online learning. The current company was founded in 2019, taking the original founding name of the business that was first established in 1960. The company is the UK distributor for Dover Publications. History Early Years David and Charles was first founded in Newton Abbot, England, on 1 April 1960 by David St John Thomas and Charles Hadfield. It made its name publishing titles on Britain's canals and railways. The company‚Äôs first employees worked from a hut in David St John Thomas‚Äô garden. As the business expanded the company relocated to the Newton Abbot railway station building, eventually taking over the locomotive shed for use as a warehouse. During the early years the company became particularly renowned for its classic books on the railways and canals of the United Kingdom. The railway linkage led to the company publishing a full page monthly advert \\"David & Charles News\\" on the back cover of The Railway Magazine. This started with a half page on the November 1966 back cover with the full page \\"News\\" starting in January 1967.[6] In the period from 1965-1970 David & Charles had an extensive list of books published with the American imprint Augustus M. Kelley. These books were usually almost identical to the United Kingdom product but with changed dust jacket and publisher's information.[7] Book Clubs In 1971, the company bought Readers' Union, a group of book clubs catering to enthusiasts of needlecraft, handicrafts, gardening, equestrian pursuits and photography. The company's publishing programme began to reflect these subject areas, moving away from the traditional transport titles for which it had become known. Membership of the book clubs peaked at 268,000 members in 1992. The company was sold to Reader‚Äôs Digest in 1990 before a subsequent management buy-out in 1997. In 2000, the company was bought by American company F+W Publications, which later became F+W Media. The growth of internet retailing led to the closure of the Readers‚Äô Union book clubs in 2008, which were replaced with the ecommerce business RUCraft. RUCraft won several awards, including Best Catalogue Refresh 2012, and was Highly Commended by Craft Business magazine for its Direct To Consumer Online Store.[9] RUCraft rebranded to become Stitch Craft Create in January 2013. F&W; Media International The company had been distributing the Interweave, Northlight and Writer‚Äôs Digest imprints on behalf of F+W Media and rebranded to become F&W; Media International in 2010. It continued to publish new books under the David and Charles imprint, focusing entirely on craft and lifestyle categories. In October 2013, the company launched a new UK ecommerce site in partnerhsip with Burda Style. In November 2015, the company moved from Newton Abbot to Pynes Hill in Exeter and completed the acquisition of the online ecommerce business SewandSo.co.uk. Return to David and Charles In March 2019, F+W Media announced entered Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings. The book publishing assets of F&W; Media International (substantially the publishing business of David and Charles) were acquired in a Management Buy-Out led by Managing Director, James Woollam. A new company was formed in July 2019 to complete the buy-out and was able to return to the David and Charles name.  Early publishing  Among the early titles were The Canals of the British Isles series, edited and often written by Hadfield ‚Äì he wrote in full or part, at least five of the volumes. Another series was the A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain (15 volumes); with the first volume written by St John Thomas and which led to the publishing of two companion series: Forgotten Railways and Railway History in Pictures. The Scottish writer John Thomas wrote a series of books on Scotland railway lines and railway companies, first published in the 1960s and 1970s by the company. John Marshall was another railway historian published by the company. The company also published travel and topographical works from the 1960s through to the 1990s of which the Islands series and the Light and the Land books by Colin Baxter were the most prominent examples. In the twenty-first century their travel publishing continued with the \\"Most Amazing Places\\" series. One of their 1968 titles was a new edition of E. Temple Thurston's The Flower of Gloster which had been out of print since 1918. The book is today regarded as both a seminal work in canal literature and a classic example of Edwardian romanticism. The company also specialised in reprints of early technical and travel works and republished several issues of Baedeker's early-20th-century country guides as well some of the Edwardian works by Fred T Jane.

It was the twelfth tropical cyclone and eighth tropical storm of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, forming on September 15 east of the Windward Islands. After degenerating into a tropical wave, the system produced flooding and mudslides in Puerto Rico. It reformed into a tropical depression on September 19 south of Cuba, and crossed the western portion of the island the next day while on the verge of dissipation. However, it intensified into a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, reaching its peak intensity while approaching the northern Gulf Coast. The storm rapidly weakened before moving ashore near Fort Walton Beach, Florida on September 22. It produced heavy rainfall along the Florida Panhandle that reached . The rains flooded hundreds of houses and caused the Sopchoppy River to reach a record crest. Gusty winds left about 5,000 people without power, though the rains alleviated drought conditions. In South Carolina, Helene spawned a tornado that killed one person and injured six others; heavy rainfall in the state also led to a death when a driver hydroplaned into a tree. The rainfall extended northeastward into Delaware. Overall damage in the United States was estimated at $16 million. Helene emerged from North Carolina as a tropical storm, and re-intensified to near- hurricane strength before being absorbed by a cold front on September 25. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the African coast on September 10. Shortly thereafter, it lost most of its atmospheric convection and initially showed few signs of development as it moved westward. On September 14, convection reformed near the center of the system. It continued to organize, and the next day the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified it as Tropical Depression Twelve. At the time, it was located 470 mi (765 km) east of the Leeward Islands. By this point, the depression had a weak circulation and ragged convection. An anticyclone to its north caused the depression to move generally to the west, and upper-level conditions were forecast to be favorable for intensification. However, the circulation moved away from the main area of convection before a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated that the depression degenerated into a tropical wave on September 16. Although there was not a closed circulation, the flight observed flight- level winds of to the north and east of the system. The remnants of the depression continued westward, moving through the Lesser Antilles on September 17. Despite favorable conditions for redevelopment including low wind shear and warm ocean temperatures, the system remained a tropical wave as it moved across the Caribbean Sea. Late on September 19, another reconnaissance plane discovered a closed circulation to the northwest of Grand Cayman. Although there was minimal convection near the center, it organized enough to be re- classified as a tropical depression. Upon redeveloping, the depression was moved west-northwestward around a large anticyclone to the east of Florida. Its circulation was broad, though the NHC anticipated further strengthening. Conditions remained favorable for intensification, but instead the depression weakened as it approached Cuba. Around 1200 UTC on September 20, it moved across the western tip of Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico with minimal thunderstorms near the center. A few hours later, the NHC noted that \\"the cyclone [was] on the verge of breaking open into an east-west oriented trough\\". The agency did not discontinue advisories due to an increase in convection near the center, although no intensification was expected. However, the system's circulation and convection became better organized, and early on September 21 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Helene. Tropical Storm Helene near its initial peak intensity on September 21 Upon becoming a tropical storm, Helene gradually turned to the north while rounding an anticyclone to its east. It rapidly intensified after its upgrade, and reached its peak intensity of late on September 21. The storm was small with an asymmetric wind field, and wind shear displaced the circulation from the deep convection. Increasing wind shear prevented Helene from attaining hurricane status, and the storm began weakening on September 22 as it approached the northern Gulf Coast. By 0900 UTC that day, strong wind shear moved the convection away from the center and toward the north and northeast. This prompted NHC forecaster Lixion Avila to remark, \\"If I did not have a reconnaissance plane in the area, I would not know there was a tropical cyclone by just observing IR satellite imagery.\\" The storm made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida at 1200 UTC on September 22 after weakening from its peak intensity to winds of . After moving ashore, an area of convection redeveloped over Helene's center and the circulation became well-defined on radar imagery. The storm accelerated to the northeast into the Westerlies, and about six hours following its landfall, Helene weakened to tropical depression status after crossing into southeastern Alabama. A few hours later, the NHC issued the last advisory on the system and transferred warnings to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center. Hurricane forecast models anticipated restrengthening, and due to the forecast track north of the Gulf Stream, the NHC predicted intensification as an extratropical cyclone. The agency noted that Tropical Storm Danny re-intensified in the same region as a tropical cyclone. Despite strong wind shear, convection increased over Helene's center as the storm moved through North Carolina. Stations along the Outer Banks reported sustained winds up to . Satellite imagery and buoy data indicated that Helene re-intensified into a tropical storm inland over North Carolina. The storm emerged from the Virginia coast into an area of less wind shear, where conditions were thus more favorable for strengthening. The storm became compact over the northern Atlantic Ocean, with a diameter of . Strong convection developed over the center on September 24, and the following day Helene re-attained its peak intensity of while southeast of Nova Scotia. The wind estimate was based on observations from the Neptune Olivine, a nearby ship that recorded winds and a barometric pressure of ; because the ship was located to the south of the center, the storm's minimum pressure was estimated at . Helene continued moving rapidly to the east-northeast, and late on September 25 dissipated as it was absorbed by a cold front. Preparations and impact Total rainfall of Helene across the Southeastern U.S. Caribbean When Tropical Depression Twelve first formed, several governments across the Lesser Antilles issued a tropical storm watch, including the SSS islands, Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Montserrat, and Saint Kitts and Nevis. The watch was discontinued after the depression degenerated into a tropical wave. As a tropical wave, Helene moved through the Lesser Antilles with strong winds; gusts on Guadeloupe reached . The system also produced heavy rainfall, reaching on Antigua. The wave passed to the south of Puerto Rico on September 17 and 18. Across the southern and eastern portion of the island, the system produced of rainfall, which resulted in flash flooding and mudslides. One house was destroyed and more than 100 houses were affected in Ponce, forcing several families to evacuate. The flooding also destroyed a bridge in Guayama and made many roads impassable. Damage on the island was estimated at $100,000 (2000 USD). After the system redeveloped into a tropical depression, the government of Cuba issued a tropical storm warning for the provinces of Isla de la Juventud, Havana, and Pinar del R√≠o, as well as for the city of Havana. United States Radar image of Tropical Storm Helene shortly after making landfall About 21 hours before Helene made landfall, the NHC issued a tropical storm warning from the border of Louisiana and Mississippi to the mouth of the Aucilla River along the Florida Panhandle. Six hours later, the agency also issued a hurricane watch from the border of Florida and Alabama to the mouth of the Aucilla River. The day before the storm moved ashore, local American Red Cross chapters had 18 emergency shelters on standby to house storm evacuees. One shelter opened in Tallahassee and one in Apalachicola. About 130 people evacuated to shelters in the western portion of the Florida panhandle and planes evacuated military bases in the region. Government buildings were closed in Okaloosa, and schools were closed in Okaloosa, Walton, and Santa Rosa counties. Despite being a weak tropical cyclone at landfall, Tropical Storm Helene caused $16 million in damage (2000 USD). In Alabama, wind gusts reached at Brookley Air Force Base in Mobile; the same station recorded the highest rainfall in the state, with a total of . The storm also caused minor beach erosion and coastal damage along Dauphin Island. In neighboring Florida, the storm dropped heavy rainfall along the panhandle, peaking at in Apalachicola. The rains caused flooding, notably in Franklin, Wakulla, and Leon counties, all of which closed schools and public buildings. Flood warnings were issued for areas affected by Tropical Storm Gordon five days prior. High rainfall caused the Sopchoppy River to exceed its banks and reach a record crest of , breaking the previous record set in 1970. Several homes and nearby roads were flooded near the river. About 100 homes were flooded in Leon County, and 70 streets were flooded in Tallahassee. Portions of U.S. Highway 98 were flooded in Port St. Joe and near Carrabelle. About 70 people had to evacuate their homes due to the flooding. Flooding was minimal in the western Florida panhandle due to drought conditions the previous summer. Sustained winds across the state peaked at , though gusts reached at Cape San Blas. At that location, there was over $100,000 in road damage and beach loss. The winds combined with the heavy rainfall caused trees to fall onto power lines, leaving about 5,000 people without electricity. The storm spawned 6 tornadoes along the panhandle, one of which destroyed several mobile homes in Wakulla. As the storm moved ashore, tides were less than above normal, but were high enough to cause minor beach erosion. In Leon County, the storm destroyed two homes and six mobile homes, and damaged more than 120 homes in Wakulla County. Counties eligible for public assistance When Helene moved through Georgia, it had sustained winds of around , with higher gusts. It dropped heavy rainfall along its path, with a statewide peak of in Dunwoody. The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions across the state. However, the combination of winds and rainfall downed trees and power lines; one falling tree damaged a car in Sandersville. To the northwest of Georgia, rainfall spread into Tennessee, reaching in Copperhill. As Helene moved through South Carolina, it spawned an F2 tornado in Martin that killed one person, injured six, and damaged 12 houses. The highest rainfall in the United States associated with Helene was a total of in Bamberg, though weather radar images estimated totals of up to . The rains caused flooding along Highway 47, in nearby Orangeburg County where were recorded. In Berkeley County, a woman died after hydroplaning and driving her car into a tree. Rainfall in North Carolina peaked at in Longwood; in Jacksonville, the precipitation caused street flooding. Off the shore of North Carolina, a station at Diamond Shoal Light reported wind gusts of while Helene was re-intensifying into a tropical storm. Along the coast, the highest gusts were , reported at both Cape Lookout and Duck. Rainfall from the storm extended through Virginia and into Delaware. Canada After re-intensifying into a tropical storm for a second time, Helene passed to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. Although its strongest winds remained offshore, the outer rainbands dropped light precipitation, peaking at 0.89 in (22.5 mm) in eastern Nova Scotia, and 1.18 in (30 mm) in southeastern Newfoundland. Aftermath On October 3, United States President Bill Clinton declared nine Florida counties as disaster areas, which allocated federal funding for debris removal, emergency services, and restoration of damaged public facilities. In Franklin County, many residents had to boil water before consumption due to contaminated water wells. As a result, the local Red Cross chapter provided water bottles to the affected residents. The Red Cross also deployed two Mobile Feeding Vehicles to Wakulla County, and a total of 700 meals were ultimately distributed.

Timothy Todd Anderson was named director of the band in 2011. Also in 2011, the George N. Parks Minuteman Marching Band Building was completed, giving the band its first home since the Old Chapel was closed in 1997.http://dailycollegian.com/2011/11/07/campus- officially-opens-george-n-parks-minuteman-marching-band-building/ History The Morris Drum Corps in 1881 Old Chapel, home of the band for many years The band program at University of Massachusetts Amherst started in 1873 when the University was known as the Massachusetts Agricultural College. The Morris Drum Corps, as it was known, was the first resemblance of a marching band at the school, and it was directed by First Lieutenant Charles Morris of the 5th Army Artillery. In the 1890s, the band was renamed the Clark Memorial Cadet Band after former college president William S. Clark. At the close of the century the band's instrumentation expanded, but the musicians consisted only of military cadets. In 1931, the Massachusetts Agricultural College, or \\"Aggie\\", became the Massachusetts State College. Soon after, in 1934, the College hired its first music instructor, Frank Stratton. A year later, Massachusetts Agricultural College started to organize a formal band program, and appointed its first non-military band instructor, Charles Farnum. The newly created band became known as the \\"Redmen Marching Band\\". In 1938, the band had its most successful season to date by playing at all home games and an away game versus the United States Coast Guard Academy. During World War II, all bands at the University were disbanded from March 1943 until September 1945 because many of the members served in the military. After the war, the band remained small, so the director set out to create a female \\"drill team\\" to augment the band. In 1946, this team expanded to a size of 44. This drill team was given the name of the \\"Precisionettes\\" in 1952. In 1947 the Massachusetts State College became the University of Massachusetts. The band's name changed from the Redmen Marching Band to the Minuteman Marching Band in the 1970s under the leadership of Professor John Jenkins. Jenkins brought a new style of marching, high step rapid rhythm (thighs parallel to the ground) to UMass from the University of Michigan, and composer Jerry Bilik, who notably wrote the \\"Fight Mass\\" fight song. In 1977, George N. Parks was hired to direct the band. Parks brought the roll-step marching style and fostered the reputation that the band has today. His unique styles and intensity were widely praised. Until 1997, the band was housed in Old Chapel on campus. From then, and until the October 17, 2009 groundbreaking of a marching band specific building, the band utilized a variety of campus locations for space. The University named the building in honor of George Parks. In 2010, George Parks suffered a heart attack while traveling with the band to the University of Michigan. Associate director Tom Hannum was named interim director. In 2011, Timothy Todd Anderson was named permanent Director and Professor Hannum resumed his role as Associate Director. Christine McHugh Sirard was named Assistant Director in 2015, and serves as director of the color guard.

In addition to the instrumentation on the field, the band has keyboards, marimba, electric guitar and bass as well as various singers. The wind and guard sections of the band do not require auditions for their members, however some instruments like the piccolo, guitar, bass, and vocals require an audition which is open to any band member. The twirlers, drum line and front ensemble are auditioned. Style The Minuteman Band's style is that of a drum corps, forming precise drill sets and shapes. However, The UMMB is known for its \\"dance-like moves\\" and tends to mix them in with the more traditional marching styles. The main show theme usually includes traditional marching band styles with some songs that are looser and less rigid. The band's use of amplification with electric guitars and other percussion often gives the band the reputation as a non-traditional marching band. Colorguard The UMMB colorguard during the 2006 season The UMass Colorguard and Twirlers are the visual sections in the University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band, the Power and Class of New England. The Colorguard is led by Chris McHugh Sirard and is a fully modernized ensemble utilizing flag, rifle, sabre, dance, and alternative equipment. The twirlers are led by Kristi Ochs, they incorporate baton, dance, and ribbon into their routines. The UMass colorguard began in 1974 and has been performing along side the UMMB ever since. The UMMB and Colorguard perform at halftime and during post-game at all home football games and frequently travels to away games. The band has also performed at Bands of America in 1993, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2011. Currently there are over 40 members in the UMass colorguard. Percussion The UMass Drumline The Minuteman Marching Band's percussion section is widely considered to be one of the best in the nation. The UMass Drumline has helped to build a national reputation for their dedication, skill, and hard work that is paralleled by few others in the nation. The percussion section is instructed by DCI Hall of Famer Thom Hannum. Hannum is best known for his work in Drum Corps International, as well as being a clinician and author of percussive technique books. The UMass Drumline is also known for many of its alumni who have branched out into many teaching and writing opportunities in percussive arts throughout the nation. Seasons=2003-2007 The 2003 Season show consisted of a mix of songs with no clearly set theme. It has sometimes been called \\"Hot Jazz\\". Among the songs were \\"Birdland\\", \\"El Boro\\", \\"Legend of the One Eyed Sailor\\", \\"Get it On\\", and Gloria Estefan's \\"Oye Tu Conga\\". The pit was featured on a version of Radiohead's \\"Paranoid Android\\". The band went to Delaware, Allentown, MICCA Regionals in Bridgeport, CT., and to a post-season game at Colgate. The 2004 Season show consisted of music from the musical West Side Story and songs written by Elton John. Notable performances included the Bands of America Grand Nationals at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana where they also performed the song \\"God Bless the USA\\" as backing band for Lee Greenwood. A smaller group of the band also performed at the Boston Public Library for a private event celebrating William Bulger's 70th birthday. The 2005 season consisted of music from the movie Troy and the band Earth, Wind, and Fire. Among the notable performances during this season, the band played at the football game between UMass and the United States Army at West Point. During this performance, the band played Lee Greenwood's \\"God Bless the USA\\" in honor of the armed forces. They also performed at Symphony Hall in Boston. The mellophone section during a halftime show in 2006 The Minuteman Band's main show for 2006 contained music from Henry V and the band Chicago. Performances included the UMass football games against the US Navy and the Canadian national football league playoff game in Montreal. The band's normal season was extended because UMass's football team made the playoffs. The band played their final halftime show of the 2006 post season in Chattanooga, Tennessee, at the NCAA National Championship game vs. Appalachian State University. They also performed at Symphony Hall in Boston and for a ceremony celebrating the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Medicine to Dr. Craig Mello at the DCU Center in Worcester, Mass for which both the Governor and Lieutenant Governor were in attendance. 2007's show included Russian Christmas Music, \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\", and three hits by Gloria Estefan including \\"Anything for You\\", \\"Oye tu Conga\\" and \\"Get on your Feet\\". In 2007, the Band performed in Allentown, Pennsylvania, all home UMass Football games, and the National Bands of America in Indianapolis. 2008-2012 The 2008 show contained the fifth movement of Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, an abridged version of Billy Joel's \\"And So It Goes\\", Dave Weckl's \\"Tiempo de Festival\\" (performed as the percussion feature), and a medley of Stevie Wonder songs (\\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\", \\"Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing\\", \\"For Once In My Life\\", and \\"Fingertips\\"). \\"Mon Homme\\" (known by its English title \\"My Man\\") and \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" were arranged for the season's performance with University of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hen Marching Band, and a medley of patriotic songs was performed during the final two home football games.

Other featured selections included \\"Swing Street\\" By Barry Manilow and Tchaikovsky's \\"1812 Overture\\". The percussion section headlined \\"Won't You Come Home, Bill Bailey\\". The show was debuted on September 12, 2009, at halftime of the Albany game. During band camp, the band recorded a music video with the group Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers for their newest song at the time \\"Shady Esperanto and the Young Hearts\\". The group choose to use the Marching Band in the video because several members of the Sixers are Alumni of the university and the marching band. The fall 2010 show featured music from the motion picture The Wind and the Lion as well as a medly Madonna songs. The selection from the movie included \\"The Wind and The Lion\\". Other music included \\"Canto Del Viento\\", the percussion feature \\"Oye Tu Conga\\", and Madonna's \\"Like a Prayer\\". Later shows in the season added arrangements of I'll Be There by The Jackson 5 and When the Saints Go Marching In. Parts of the show were debuted on September 4, 2010, at halftime of the William and Mary game. The fall 2010 season included performances in Allentown and a game at the University of Michigan. On September 16, 2010, while in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, George N. Parks suffered a fatal heart attack after the band's performance for the local high school and opposing team's band. The band played for the high schoolers as a \\"thank you\\" for being allowed to use their facilities during a stopover on the Michigan trip. The band decided to go ahead to Michigan, and performed to great success in front of 110,187 people, the largest audience in the band's history. When the band returned to Cuyahoga Falls on their way home, the town provided a banquet when the band arrived, and a police escort when they departed the next day. Two weeks after Michigan, the band performed in Allentown. The following week, for Homecoming, the school held a two-hour tribute in the Mullins Center for Parks before that days football game. For halftime, an alumni band composed of almost 1,000 past members performed first a tune, and then a combined performance with current members of the band.

The mall was demolished except for the Jamesway and Service Merchandise buildings. Currently, the former mall property is the site of a Home Depot store, as well as the former Service Merchandise building that has been gutted and now awaiting future use, with the Dutchess Marketplace Flea Market in the former Jamesway, and the rest of the property awaiting further redevelopment. Dagar Group manages the shopping area. R.C. Chera Realty Group is the exclusive leasing broker for the existing vacant structure. History Dutchess Mall opened during 1974 as the first mall in Dutchess County. The mall occupied a portion of a site used during the American Revolutionary War by the Fishkill Encampment and Supply Depot, which has been listed on the National Register of Historical Places since Dutchess Mall's opening. The Fishkill Encampment was previously scheduled for conversion to a national park, but the plan was rejected. Original anchors of the mall included Mays and Luckey Platt, two local department stores; other major tenants included Flah's (another local department store) and Drug World (a pharmacy), as well as Radio Shack (an electronics store) and Waldenbooks (a bookstore). Former Jamesway/Mays store in 2004 Mays, which closed following their 1982 bankruptcy, was replaced with Gaynes.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&dat;=19851110&id;=E5FGAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=njMNAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3136,947795 Gaynes, in turn, was converted to a Jamesway discount shop during 1988, which closed following their liquidation in 1995. Luckey Platt closed in the 1980s and was replaced with Service Merchandise, which closed on December 24, 1996, and relocated to the South Hills Mall nearby. The former Service Merchandise was soon replaced with the Dutchess Flea Market. With both anchor stores gone, the other shops began ending operations as well, and by 2001 only the flea market remained. For several years, Dutchess Mall was the only mall serving its area; however, it was often unable to attract many well-known tenants, due to rumors of a larger mall being built nearby. The rumored mall, which would have been anchored by Macy's, was never built. Because it could not attract stores easily, and because the anchor stores had changed, the Dutchess Mall was quick to lose tenants, eventually replacing a large portion of its retail space with a satellite campus of Marist College. Other problems of the mall included an outdated mall design; competition from the nearby Poughkeepsie Galleria and South Hills Mall; and the beginning of big box type retail. Proposed revitalization During 1999, plans were announced to convert the mall into a business community named Hudson Valley Metro Centre. The project would have included office tenants, a recreational facility, child care, and restaurants. Due to high startup costs, the plan was abandoned, and by 2001, the mall was sealed off entirely except for the flea market, which remained open. Two years later, a group of designers from New York devised a plan to convert Dutchess Mall into a women's prison. This plan was one of the finalists in \\"Dead Malls\\", a competition created by the Los Angeles Forum for Architecture and Urban Design. This plan, however, was not realized. Interior of Dutchess Flea Market, 2004. Finally, after several years of vacancy, the mall was demolished for a Home Depot, which opened on July 5, 2006. Only the mall building itself was demolished. The former Jamesway and Service Merchandise buildings were left intact. Due to the demolition of the mall, the flea market was soon closed. Home Depot isn't the only store still open, as there is a McDonald's and a Citizen's Bank branch occupying space in the lot as well. As of 2014 the old Jamesway has since become the Dutchess Marketplace, a flea market with a variety of vendors. Behind the small part of the strip mall is a golf shop.http://philipstown.info/2013/12/31/flea-market- opens-route-9-fishkill/ By the end of 2019, the Dutchess Marketplace closed. In August 2019, Dutchess Community College announced plans to open a campus at the site of the former mall. Fish Kill Flea During 2007, Dutchess Mall was the subject of a documentary named Fish Kill Flea; the documentary's emphasis was the mall's flea market.

The correct Hebrew pronunciation is \\"Chalev Yisrael.\\" (), common Ashkenazi pronunciation Cholov Yisroel, is a Halachic term which refers to all dairy products, including cheese and non-fat dry milk powder, which derive from milk that has been milked under the supervision of a religiously observant Jew. Cholov Yisroel sour cream sold in Canada. In Judaic law According to Jewish law (halacha), milk is only considered kosher if it derives from a kosher species of animal (such as cows and sheep), while milk from a non-kosher species (such as horses and camels) is non-kosher. Rabbinic authorities in Mishnaic times had already issued an injunction against the drinking of any milk whose milking was not done by, or under the supervision of a Torah-observant Israelite. Milk that has been unsupervised while being extracted is referred to in halachic literature as either chalav akum or chalav nochri. This prohibition was codified in the Shulchan Aruchsec. Yoreh Deah 115:1 which forbids consumption of any milk not milked under Jewish supervision. This prohibition forbids consumption but not any other form of use or benefit. Talmud 'Avodah Zarah 35b, see also In the USA and other countries with similar regulations The first chalav Yisrael dairy farm on the East Coast of the United States, and possibly in the entire United States, was started by Isaac Balsam in 1903, and remained in business until 1955.For some background on Isaac Balsam and the Balsam dairy farm, see Hamodia Magazine, March 4, 2009, p.3; see also All dairy products made in the USA and countries with government regulations on milk, even when bearing a kosher symbol, are likely to be \\"chalav stam\\". Chalav stam is a classification literally translating to \\"plain milk,\\" which is given to milk produced in a country where government regulations make it reasonable to assume that milk is 100% what it is labeled as (i.e. anything labeled as \\"milk\\" is 100% cows milk, goat's milk must be 100% goats milk and labeled as such, etc.). Because the supervising bodies in the United States and countries where chalav stam is acceptable impose penalties and fines on milk producers found to be in violation of this requirement, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein ruled that one can logically infer that milk produced there has not been mixed with non-kosher milk and therefore does not receive the designation of \\"chalav akum.\\" Kosher certifications in such countries usually mark \\"chalav yisrael\\" in either English or Hebrew next to their kosher symbol. In Israel, kosher certifiers don‚Äôt usually mark ‚Äúchalav yisrael‚Äù since it is the standard there‚Äîin fact, kosher dairy products in Israel that are not chalav Yisrael are typically marked as such. According to Kabbalah, it is preferable to be strict concerning chalav Yisrael due to spiritual ramifications relating to the concept that drinking non-chalav Yisrael leads to \\"timtum ha-lev\\", a spiritual deadening of the heart.

Virtual collaboration follows the same process as collaboration, but the parties involved in virtual collaboration do not physically interact and communicate exclusively through technological channels.Peters, Linda M., and Charles C. Manz. \\"Identifying antecedents of virtual team collaboration.\\" Team Performance Management 13.3/4 (2007): 117-129. Distributed teams use virtual collaboration to simulate the information transfer present in face-to-face meetings, communicating virtually through verbal, visual, written, and digital means. Virtual collaboration is commonly used by globally distributed business and scientific teams. Ideally, virtual collaboration is most effective when it can simulate face-to-face interaction between team members through the transfer of contextual information, but technological limits in sharing certain types of information prevent virtual collaboration from being as effective as face-to-face interaction. Characteristics Sharing of information: Collaboration, by definition, is a process of assembling knowledge from different parties towards a common goal. Virtual collaboration is meant to enable the sharing of knowledge between parties who cannot exchange information due to physical separation. Virtual collaboration platforms allow the transfer of different types of information between collaborators to work towards a common goal.Jarvenpaa, Sirkka L., and D. Sandy Staples. \\"The use of collaborative electronic media for information sharing: an exploratory study of determinants.\\" The Journal of Strategic Information Systems 9.2 (2000): 129-154. Dispersed Collaborators: Collaborators within virtual collaboration are physically separated from each other and can only interact virtually. Being able to physically interact with a team member affords many benefits that virtual collaboration cannot provide, and eliminates any need for virtual meetings (sharing of context, interpersonal relationships, etc.).Rutkowski, A. F., Vogel, D. R., Van Genuchten, M., Bemelmans, T. M., & Favier, M. (2002). E-collaboration: The reality of virtuality . Professional Communication, IEEE Transactions on, 45(4), 219-230. Collaborators can meet physically, but interaction outside of the virtual platform may change the dynamics of the collaboration and classify it as non- virtual. Technology-mediated: Because virtual collaborators cannot interact physically they use technology to share information over several mediums. Most virtual collaboration platforms are carried out via the internet, for example email, video conferencing, and virtual workspaces. Audio conferencing can also be a means of virtual collaboration, as information is shared over a telephone or other audio device.Wainfan, Lynne, and Paul K. Davis. Challenges in virtual collaboration: Videoconferencing, audioconferencing, and computer-mediated communications. Vol. 273. RAND Corporation, 2004. Types 1- Synchronous:Synchronous collaboration occurs when team members are able to share information and ideas instantaneously. Examples of synchronous virtual collaboration include instant messaging, chat rooms, and video or audio conferencing (See figure 1). 2- Asynchronous:Asynchronous collaboration occurs when team members communicate without the ability to instantly respond to messages or ideas. Examples of asynchronous virtual collaboration include e-mail, discussion boards, application-specific groupware, or shared databases (See figure 1). Figure 1. A simple diagram to explain the two modes abstractly. By: Jakob Jenkov Advantages Pooling of expertise: Virtual collaboration provides more opportunities for experts to join project groups where their knowledge can be best used, and be complemented with other experts whose knowledge contributes to a common goal. Virtual collaboration allows teams to be formed based on subject and expertise, without the restriction of physical proximity of collaborators. The pool of expertise is much greater abroad than in most local team settings, meaning that virtual collaboration gives teams an opportunity to add a quality expert that fits the needs of the team. This can be proved by the fact that dispersed teams with recruited experts tend to have higher net earnings than local teams with a local expert.Boh, Wai Fong, et al. \\"Expertise and collaboration in the geographically dispersed organization.\\" organization science 18.4 (2007): 595-612. Cost effective: Compared to face-to-face meetings of distributed group members, virtual collaboration is much less costly. The time and costs associated with transportation to physically bring together team members from different geographic locations can be substantially higher than the cost of a virtual collaborative application. Software used to connect distributed teams can be found for free on the internet, with more feature-loaded and specialized applications having a one-time cost or a paid subscription. Disadvantages Lower Group Potency:Virtual collaboration reduces the interaction among the team members, which leads to ineffective discussion and adoption of option that are risker and perhaps less well considered in face to face communication, as said complex task becomes more complex in VC. Moreover due to anonymity of the expert and invisibility of status effect there arises many issues like pressure to conform, lack of appreciation on the performance and can impact the group processes and outcome significantly.Lira, E. M., Ripoll, P., Peir√≥, J. M., & Orengo, V. (2008). How do different types of intragroup conflict affect group potency in virtual compared with face-to-face teams? A longitudinal study. Behaviour & Information Technology, 27, 107-114. Reduced Cohesiveness:Cohesive groups are generally warm, sociable and personal when it comes to interaction with other members of the group. But with virtual collaboration people tend to have more intragroup conflict than F2F this is due to the exchange of fewer social remarks and less participation.O'Neill, T. A., Hancock, S. E., Zivkov, K., Larson, N. L., & Law, S. J. (2016). Team decision making in virtual and face to-face environments. Group Decision and Negotiation, 25, 995-1020. . Poor Satisfaction:As 93% of meaning is contained in facial and vocal cues rather than in text. Therefore technology like virtual collaboration are deprived of facial expression, vocal intonations and indicator of understanding therefore there is a lack of trust and satisfaction in the among the team members collaborating virtually. Merienne, F. (2010). Human factors consideration in the interaction process with virtual environment. International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing, 4, 83-86. Technological limits: Because technology cannot convey important information, such as context and expressions of emotion, teams are limited in their grounding of knowledge and interpersonal relations. Many of the disadvantages that come with virtual collaboration are the same as those found in virtual groups, due to the fact that virtual groups cannot physically interact with each other. Technology that does not effectively support either collaborators' abilities or the process of the collaboration will result in a \\"signal loss\\", or a great reduction in the power of virtual collaborationZiegler, Reinhard, and Craig Mindrum. \\"The Subtle Power of Virtual Collaboration.\\" Accenture. Reliance on Technology: Any problems that arise with the technology can obstruct a collaborative effort due to virtual collaboration‚Äôs complete reliance on technology for communication. Teams that have do not understand how to use the virtual collaboration technology cannot perform their tasks as efficiently and have higher frustration levels. Malfunctions in the communication technology can also hinder task progress.Tarmizi, Halbana, et al. \\"Technical and environmental challenges of collaboration engineering in distributed environments.\\" Groupware: Design, Implementation, and Use (2006): 38-53. Also, incompatible or differing technology used between team members may make it more difficult for task to be accomplished.Steinfield, Charles, Chyng-Yang Jang, and Ben Pfaff. \\"Supporting virtual team collaboration: the TeamSCOPE system.\\" Conference on Supporting Group Work: Proceedings of the international ACM SIGGROUP conference on Supporting group work. Vol. 14. No. 17. 1999. Asynchronous and lagged communication: Collaborators that are interdependent on each other‚Äôs information can experience problems due to the lack of synchronization due to technology. Asynchronous communication does not give team members constant updates in real time, which can lead to coordination and sequencing problems for a task.Hinds, Pamela J., and Diane E. Bailey. \\"Out of sight, out of sync: Understanding conflict in distributed teams.\\" Organization science 14.6 (2003): 615-632. In video and teleconferencing, time lags due to technology- mediated communication can cause confusion between collaborators.Gergle, Darren, Robert E. Kraut, and Susan R. Fussell. \\"Using visual information for grounding and awareness in collaborative tasks.\\" (2012). Such coordination problems can frustrate collaborators and result in unnecessary work. Means of exclusion: The method of information transfer in virtual collaboration can allow for team members to choose who does and does not receive information. For example, an email can be sent from one virtual collaborator to others that they choose, and telephone calls can happen between certain collaborators and not others. This means of exclusion, whether intentional or accidental, can cause confusion and conflict within a group, hindering collaborative processes.  Challenges  Certain challenges are emphasized for utilizing virtual collaboration outcomes. These challenges are: technology-related challenges, cultural diversity-related challenges, and geographic dispersion- related challenges. To overcome these challenges, virtual team should consider knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) aspects of the members.  Technology-related challenges  The team needs to have knowledge of both the nature of their work and the virtual collaboration media they choose, and select the best suited media to deal with the most suitable situation. The team also need the skill to deal with the media to overcome issues coming from the media.  Cultural diversity-related challenges  The team members need to have good knowledge on cultural differences between members and the knowledge of choosing the proper media to smooth these differences. The members are expected to have the skill to adjust their communication behavior and the language proficiency to achieve cultural adaption.  Geographic dispersion-related challenges  The team member should clearly understand pros and cons of choosing synchronous and asynchronous medias to avoid issues resulted from dispersed workplaces. The skill of time and self-management of team members are also emphasized to overcome this challenge.  Trust-related challenges  Trust between members of virtual teams affects the quality and amount of shared information. When virtual teams meet face-to-face, it creates trust and cohesion and ensures knowledge sharing Malhotra, A., Majchrzak, A. and Rosen, B. \\"Leading Virtual Teams, Academy of Management Perspectives.\\" (2007) Vol. 21(1), 60‚Äì70.. Knowledge sharing in virtual teams influences the formation of trust and contributes to the effectiveness of the team Alsharo, M., Dawn, G. and Ramirez, R. \\"Virtual team effectiveness: The role of knowledge sharing and trust.\\" (2017) Information Management, Vol. 54, 479‚Äî490.. In written communication one cannot be sure about other members‚Äô commitment and it is difficult to recognize others‚Äô emotions Rosen, B., Furst, S. and Blackburn, R. \\"Overcoming Barriers to Knowledge Sharing in Virtual Teams.\\" (2007) Organizational Dynamics, Vol. 36 (3), 259‚Äì273..  Time-related challenges  If a virtual project is only a small part of the team members' job, members may not have enough time for the virtual project. Thus, for example, they have to process information fast. A particular challenge in virtual teams is following-through and responding at a right time because not responding could be interpreted as a lack of competence or commitment. Rosen, B., Furst, S. and Blackburn, R. \\"Overcoming Barriers to Knowledge Sharing in Virtual Teams.\\" (2007) Organizational Dynamics, Vol. 36 (3), 259‚Äì273. Other than these knowledge and skills, it‚Äôs crucial for team members to be motivated to face these challenges. Certain experiences and characteristics of team members would also show significant effect. Applications Researchers and developers find more and more areas that could benefit from not only traditional media technologies but also emerging media technologies such as Virtual Reality. The first system focused on military, industrial and medical application, but stretched out on commercial use and entertainment soon after. Military Applications Virtual collaboration proves useful in a military setting. The military application supports essential environments including design, assembly, and maintenance, and overcomes a constraint of the geographic distance of many militaries and related enterprises or partners. Thus, virtual collaboration has become indispensable for conducting a daily operation. With the technologies, the integration of fully distributed teamwork enables individuals at different workstations in the same site and those in various places to work together. For instance, military applications augment navigational support, communications enhancement, repair, and maintenance through intrasite and intersite collaborative analyses, as well as allowing the regional expertise developed at each site to be applied wherever necessary across the boundary.[Cordova, A., Keller, K. M., Menthe, L., & Rhodes, C. (2013). Virtual Collaboration for a Distributed Enterprise (No. RAND-RR-153-AF). RAND PROJECT AIR FORCE SANTA MONICA CA.] Medical Applications Virtual collaboration is used for physician and nurses, or these hospital members and their patients, to be connected even when they are apart so that they can share valuable information. For instance, Web 2.0 applications, particularly wikis, blogs, and podcasts, have been widely used by many online health-related professional. Because it is easy to use and deploy, those tools offer the opportunity for robust information sharing and interaction. One of medical blog examples is the blog, 'Clinical Case and Image.'[casesblog.blogspot.com] By sharing a related information and technologies written by one person or a group of contributors on the blog, individuals who are interested in constructing knowledge of specific topics on the online community form a virtual grouping together. Entertainment Virtual collaboration such as raid quest or military simulation is widely used in an online multiplayer game. Those tool support users to fight virtual enemies. For instance, recent years have seen the growing use of virtual worlds such as World of Warcraft, a technology-created virtual environment that incorporates representations of real-world elements such as human being, landscapes, and another object. Those virtual worlds can provide the basis for e-collaboration behavior and related outcomes as well as a platform for credible studies of trade the information and tasks.[Kock, N. (2008). E-collaboration and e-commerce in virtual worlds: The potential of Second Life and World of Warcraft. International Journal of E-collaboration, 4(3), 1] Business and Work-station Virtual collaboration is widely used in corporate businesses for its efficiency, innovation, and ability to gain or keep competitive advantages in the market. Businesses commonly use virtual collaboration technology to facilitate problem solving between teams within the company, and also to collaborate with other companies. Virtual collaboration improves profit margins by increasing operational efficiency and productivity within the company, either by means of innovating solutions or through the increased sharing of knowledge through virtual means.\\"Collaboration Transforming the Way Business Works.\\" Economist Intelligence Unit.

For example, IBM, one of the leaders in using virtual collaboration to promote business processes, has developed many systems to help employees collaborate more easily across boundaries. IBM‚Äôs use of virtual collaborative spaces, such as 3-D meeting rooms and use of avatars, in their Virtual Universe Community provides employees with a way to collaborate which has resulted in more production.Cherbakov, Luba. \\"Virtual Spaces: Enabling Immersive Collaborative Enterprise, Part 1: Introduction to the Opportunities and Technologies.\\" IBM, 30 June 2009. Education and Training Virtual collaboration is often used to connect experts in a scientific field to others that wish collaborate for researching or educating purposes. Many colleges and learning institutions use virtual systems to host information where both students and experts can share information on a certain subject. Both wikis and virtual conferencing have shown to be effective in sharing expert information to educate students or other individuals interested in the subject.Jackson, Randolph L. Peer Collaboration and Virtual Environments: A Preliminary Investigation of Multi-Participant Virtual Reality Applied in Science Education. Proc. of Symposium on Applied Computing 1999, San Antonio, TX. Experts can also virtually collaborate with other experts, across subjects, to discover new things that were not apparent when the collaborators were isolated. Virtual worlds are also now providing platforms for people to collaborate using easily accessible visual analytics. Virtual worlds also provide an arena to observe social science as it pertains to the collaborative efforts of a community.Zyga, Lisa. \\"Virtual Worlds May Be the Future Setting of Scientific Collaboration.\\" Phys.org, 4 Aug. 2009. =Wikis= Wikis are a form of virtual collaboration because they enable people to contribute to an online document that can be seen and edited by other users via the internet. Wikis are considered a Web 2.0 technology, and fall into virtual collaboration due to the collaborative process that documents go through when put into a wiki.Todorov, Valetin, and Damin Todorov. \\"Virtual Teams: Wikis and Other Collaboration Tools.\\" Meeting on the Management of Statistical Information Systems , 24 Apr. 2009. Web. Wikis may be described as \\"open virtual collaboration\\", which is based on the theories of living systems and includes concepts such as self-organization, chaos theory and emergence. Open virtual collaboration allows persons with a connection to the internet to seek out participation from others in the design and development of new ideas, processes, products, and services for personal and commercial purposes. Information technologies such as tagging and filtering ease the process of finding collaborators online. International Business Machines (IBM) and Procter & Gamble were early commercial beneficiaries of the practice of open virtual collaboration. By accessing the collective intelligence and wisdom of non-affiliated humans connected via the internet companies are able to access knowledge and expertise that might otherwise require significant cost and effort.

It is close to the town of Ypres, situated on the hill ridge separating the historical wetlands of the Yser and Leie valleys. It is also commonly known as a battlefield and the name of a campaign during World War I, the Battle of Passchendaele. History=Early history In the pre-Roman and Roman times the area of the town was located along the border between the Menapii and Morini Belgic tribes of northern Gaul and later the border between the bishoprics of Tournai and Th√©rouanne. The town is first recorded in 844 as Pascandale, and may be named after an individual by the name of Paulus or Pasko. In the Middle Ages, most of the region was ruled by the Augustine abbey of Zonnebeke and the Benedictine convent of Nonnebossen. Both the abbey and the convent were destroyed during an iconoclasm (Beeldenstorm) of 1580. First World War Passchendale Ridge gives its name in common parlance to a battle of the First World War, officially the Third Battle of Ypres. It was a British-led offensive against the Germans, lasting from 31 July to 10 November 1917. Distinguishing features included the extensive rain leading up to it, as well as the relative absence of French troops. The government of France faced a massive mutiny at the time, having lost nearly 4 million troops to this point against the Central Powers. In addition to British, Canadian, Belgian, New Zealander, Australian and Indian troops fought on the side of the Allies, under the command of Field Marshal Douglas Haig. The combination of a field littered with shell hole craters and relentless rain led to a battlefield having the consistency of porridge. The holes in the earth filled with water, debris, and bodies, causing nearly everything to be coated with a slick layer of slime. Despite the rain, contamination of the water supply led to massive dehydration and sickness amongst the troops on both sides during the long months of battle. Guns sank into the earth and troops drowned in the soft mud as they tried to charge the line. Finally, after 16 weeks of fighting in conditions which varied from rain, mud, and slime, to hot and dry weather with great clouds of dust, the initial objective of Passchendaele Ridge had been gained at a cost of 270,000 Allied casualties, including 17,000 officers. German casualties were likewise staggering, with 217,000 German casualties; the village was levelled. Sights Canadian Memorial in Passendale Different nations' war cemeteries are found in Passendale: Tyne Cot Cemetery (the largest Commonwealth cemetery in the world), the New British Cemetery, the Canadian Memorial, and the New Zealand Forces Memorial. The town also hosts a war museum as well as numerous memorials dedicated to the different nationalities that participated in the epic battle. Every year, Passendale hosts a number of commemorative events and exhibitions. Those of 2008 were the 90th memorial commemorations of the end of the First World War. Passchendaele (2008) was a Canadian film directed by Paul Gross about the Battle of Passchendaele. Local produce Passendale is also known for Passendale cheese, and hosts an annual cheese festival every August.

Johann Habermann, also Johannes Avenarius (10 August 1516 ‚Äì 5 December 1590) was a German Lutheran theologian. Life He was born at Eger (92 m. w. of Prague) on 10 August 1516. He went over to the Lutheran Church about 1540, studied theology, and filled a number of pastorates. After a brief academic activity at Jena and Wittenberg, in 1575, he accepted a call as superintendent of Naumburg-Zeitz. He died at Zeitz (23 m. s.w. of Leipzig) on 5 December 1590. Works Though praised by his contemporaries as an Old Testament exegete, his significance lies in the practical field. He published a number of sermons, a Trostb√ºchlein, a life of Christ, and above all the prayer-book, Christliche Gebet f√ºr alle Not und Stende der gantzen Christenheit (1565, 2. edition 1567), in which, for the first time, the prayers for various Christian needs were apportioned among the several days of the week. With a few exceptions the prayers are written in plain Biblical language, without ornament. The work was translated into Latin, English (as The Enimie of Securitie, London, 1580), and French, and was widely circulated in Protestant circles. Despite its occasional crudities of expression the book is still used; and some of the prayers have passed into church books.

He had mailed one letter to wife Dorothy which has never been made public, and one to Hugh Hefner which stated \\"I cannot go on living with myself and hurting those dear to me.\\" The last strips he produced were run on September 7 (daily) and September 21 (Sunday).

Apeldoorn, Ger. [article in Alter Ego #150 on Stan Lee's efforts to get out of comics, with sample: \\"Get Me Out of Here\\"] Characters and story The series was narrated by the leading male character, befuddled daydreamer Chester B. Tibbit, who suffered in a dead-end job as a department-store floorwalker. He started by relating the story of how he met his wife a few years earlier (\\"I‚Äôll never forget the day I met Betsy. Let‚Äôs see... was it June or August?\\"), followed by their courtship and marriage, and then the birth of their son. Next came the accounts of Farley's babyhood, and it was obvious before he could walk or talk that the boy was a supergenius. After a little over two months of introducing the family, Chet shifted the storyline to the \\"present,\\" when Farley was a pompous and cynical five-year-old with no patience for clueless adults like the family's sarcastic swinging-bachelor friend, Gus. Readers experienced the Tibbits' sudden \\"need\\" for their first car (a 1945 \\"Huppmobile\\") after realizing that everyone else already had one (\\"We were the last of a dying race\\"), and then their plan to move to a new tract house in suburban Sunken Hills. Many strips began with well-intentioned but delusional bumbler Chet sitting in his living room talking directly to the reader. He tended to romanticize his narration, and the humor came from the fact that his rosy \\"voice-over\\" captions usually contradicted what actually happened in the drawings.Cole, Jack; Parks, Dwight (2007).

Ryan Anthony wrote, \\"It's uncertain if even the incomparable Cole could have sustained his creation if he'd lived.\\" Speaking of Cole's life, some believe it can be glimpsed in his last work. Art Spiegelman went so far as to declare that Betsy and Me \\"reads like a suicide note delivered in daily installments!\\" Robert C. Harvey would seem to support this theory by suggesting that \\"the basic comedy of the strip\\" lay in \\"confront[ing] the laughable difference between appearance and reality,\\" something the cartoonist had to do daily by presenting a happy fictional family while he and his wife had no children of their own. Ron Goulart cautioned that the strip can be seen as autobiographical \\"if you don't get too serious about it,\\" but others, such as Chris Mautner of Comic Book Resources, have expressed doubts that it \\"can bear the weight of such a theory.\\"Mautner, Chris. \\"Comics College ‚Äì Jack Cole\\".

Ryan Anthony concluded in his Amazon review that the book \\"will only be indispensable to Jack Cole completists and those interested in the last work of an unqualified comic genius.\\" According to Publishers Weekly, the collection only exists because \\"we're living in the Golden Age of comic reprints . . . and we still don't know exactly why author Cole killed himself.\\" R.

In it had a population of . History=Early history Control over Ghajar has changed hands many times. Three hundred years ago, the village was known as Taranjeh. It was renamed Ghajar under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, when the land was allegedly seized from the \\"villagers\\" by Kurds and forcibly sold. According to \\"local\\" legend, the Kurdish governor of Ghajar tried to ride his horse onto the tomb of a local holy man, Sheikh al-Arba'in. The horse refused and the following day a fire broke out, destroying the governor's shield and sword. The Kurds fled and quickly sold it back. Modern era Homes in Ghajar In 1932, the residents of Ghajar, predominantly Alawites, were given the option of choosing their nationality and overwhelmingly chose to be a part of Syria, which has a sizable Alawite minority. Prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Ghajar was considered part of Syria and its residents were counted in the 1960 Syrian census.\\"Getting rid of Ghajar\\". When Israel occupied the Golan Heights after capturing it from Syria in 1967, Ghajar remained a no-man's land for two and a half months. The Alawi villagers petitioned the Golan's Israeli governor to be attached to the occupied territory, as part of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, rather than Lebanon, because they considered themselves to be Syrians, like the majority of the native residents of the Golan at that time. Israel agreed to include Ghajar in its occupied territory of the Syrian Golan Heights and the residents accordingly accepted living under Israeli rule.Dudu Ben-Tzur's interview with Khatib Jamal, a resident of Ghajar, December 1993. Published in Hebrew in Teva Ha-Dvarim, 2nd issue, February‚ÄìMarch 1994 . In 1981, most Alawi villagers were forced to accept Israeli citizenship under the Golan Heights Law which annexed the occupied Syrian territory to Israel, but the unilateral annexation was not recognized by the international community. After Operation Litani in 1978, Israel turned over its positions inside Lebanon to the South Lebanon Army and inaugurated its Good Fence policy. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was created after the incursion, following the adoption of Security Council Resolution 425 in March 1978 to confirm Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, restore international peace and security, and help the government of Lebanon restore its effective authority in the area. Ghajar expanded northward into Lebanese territory, subsuming the Wazzani settlement north of the border.\\"A New Fence Is Added to a Border Town Already Split\\". The New York Times. 11 October 2006. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon. In 2000, following the campaign promise and election of Ehud Barak as Prime Minister, Israel withdrew their troops from Lebanon. In an attempt to demarcate permanent borders between Israel and Lebanon, the United Nations drew up what became known as the Blue Line. Due to Ghajar's location, wedged between Lebanon and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, the northern half of the village came under Lebanese control and the southern part remained under Israeli control. This arrangement created much resentment among the residents, who see themselves as Syrian. Despite the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, tension mounted as Hezbollah made attempts to kidnap Israeli soldiers in the Ghajar area.\\"Kidnap of soldiers in July was Hezbollah's fifth attempt\\". In 2005, Hezbollah launched a missile on Ghajar and infiltrated it, but withdrew after being repelled by the Israelis. Following another attack in July 2006, Israel invaded southern Lebanon and re- occupied the northern half of Ghajar during the 2006 Lebanon War. Following a month of intense fighting, UNSC Resolution 1701 was unanimously approved to resolve the conflict, and it was accepted by combatants on both sides. Among other things, the resolution demanded the full cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the disarming of Hezbollah, the deployment of Lebanese and UNIFIL soldiers, and the establishment of full control by the government of Lebanon. =The Blue Line fixation= Ghajar village park In April 2009, the Lebanese paper Daily Star reported the IDF had agreed to withdraw from northern Ghajar at a meeting at Ras al-Naqoura.\\"Israel to withdraw from northern Ghajar ‚Äì report\\". On 13 May, the government of Israel suspended talks to await the outcome of the Lebanese Parliamentary elections, fearing a Hezbollah victory.\\"'Israel delays plan to quit Lebanon border town'\\". In the wake of reports in December 2009 of a possible withdrawal of Israeli troops, 2,200 Ghajar residents took to the streets in protest.Residents of Ghajar protest rumored Israeli withdrawal: More than 2,000 took to streets to reject division of village On November 2010, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed the UN Secretary General of Israeli intentions to unilaterally withdraw from Ghajar, after failing to come to an agreement with Lebanon \\"Israel to withdraw from village on Lebanon border\\".Ravid, Barak \\"Lieberman: Israel will quit Lebanon town unilaterally due to Hezbollah refusal to cooperate.\\" Haaretz, 7 November 2010 and place security matters into the hands of UNIFIL.\\"Cabinet set to approve unilateral withdrawal from Ghajar\\". On 17 November 2010, Security Cabinet of Israel voted in favor of withdrawal from northern half of Ghajar.\\"Israel approves unilateral pullout from Lebanon border town\\". As the Syrian Civil War erupted, Israel halted redeployment along the border. Moreover, residents of Ghajar object to division of the village.Disputed Alawite village caught between Israel, Hezbollah Citizenship Ghajar Village Local Council Residents on both sides of the village have Israeli citizenship; those in the northern half often hold passports from both Lebanon and Israel. They work and travel freely within Israel, but those living on the Lebanese side have difficulties receiving services from Israel. There is an Israel Defense Forces checkpoint at the entrance to the village, and a fence surrounding the entire village, but no fence or barrier dividing the two sides of the village. UNIFIL observers The UN has physically marked the recognized border and Israeli soldiers remain on the Lebanese side of Ghajar despite the decision of the Israeli cabinet on 3 December 2006, to hand it over to UNIFIL. Israel says that the Lebanese army rejected a UN-brokered proposal in which the Lebanese Army would protect the vicinity north of the village, while UNIFIL would be deployed in the village itself; this type of arrangement would be unique for UNIFIL in populated areas. A perimeter fence has been built along the northern edge of the village in Lebanese territory up to 800 meters north of the Blue Line. UNIFIL military observers patrol the area continuously.Lebanon holding up IDF Ghajar pullout In its October 2007 report on the implementation of the resolution, the United Nations issued a report stating that discussions on the duration of temporary security arrangements for northern Ghajar remained deadlocked. Israel remains in control north of the Blue Line and the small adjacent area inside Lebanese territory, although it does not maintain a permanent military presence there. The Lebanese Armed Forces patrol the road outside the perimeter fence. The report notes \\"so long as the Israel Defense Forces remain in northern Ghajar, Israel will not have completed its withdrawal from southern Lebanon in accordance with its obligations under resolution 1701 (2006).\\" It further notes: \\"Failure to make progress on this issue could become a source of tension and carry the potential for incidents in the future.\\"UN Security Council document S/2007/641 , paragraphs 16 and 71 Problematic border demarcation The reliability of the Blue Line in the area of the Ghajar has been questioned, based on cartographic and historical points of view. According to an article in Haaretz newspaper, there has never been an agreement over the exact location of the boundary in Ghajar and its vicinity. Maps produced prior to 1967 have been inconsistent, placing the village occasionally in Syria, at different times in Lebanon and less frequently divided between the two states. Ghajar, when under full Syrian control before the 1967 war, extended to include both sections of the village that were divided by the Blue Line in 2000‚Äîboth the southern section that was annexed by Israel and the northern part that Israel is being asked to return to Lebanon. According to a researcher from the University of Notre Dame, \\"This is clearly seen in reports of and sketches made by the US Embassy in Beirut that tried to decipher the problems of sovereignty in the tri-border region during the 'water wars' in the early 1960s between Israel and its Arab neighbors.\\" The village has been divided by the Blue Line into two 'neighborhoods' that in 2000 were mistakenly thought to be two different villages: Ghajar in the south and al-Wazzani in the north. The village of al- Wazzani, the supposedly northern village that as of July 2000 lies within Lebanon, has never really existed. There is a small community called al- Wazzani, better known as ‚ÄòArab al-Luweiza', but it is located west of the Hasbani river across from Ghajar.\\"Border Control / The thin blue line\\" .

Established in 1981, they are the most prestigious comedy prize in the United Kingdom. The awards have been directed and produced by Nica Burns since 1984. Format The main prize, which was for many years the only prize, and is now known as the Best Comedy Show, is awarded \\"for the funniest, most outstanding, up-and-coming comic / comedy show / act\\" at the Fringe. The winner receives a cash prize of ¬£10,000 and an invitation to perform at the Montreal, Toronto and Chicago Just for Laughs Comedy Festivals. The Best Newcomer Award category was introduced in 1992, and is given to the best \\"performer or act who is performing their first full-length show (50 minutes or more)\\". The prize is ¬£5,000. Newcomers are eligible for the Best Comedy Show Award, but no act is allowed to appear on both shortlists in the same year. A further prize, the Panel Prize, was inaugurated in 2006. All shows are eligible, and the award may not be awarded at all, if the panel so choose. This happened in 2017, when for the first time there were joint winners of the main prize. Previously, in 2008, it had been awarded to \\"every comedian on the Fringe\\". Like Best Newcomer, the Panel Prize winner receives a cash prize of ¬£5,000. History The original award was created by Perrier in 1981 as a way of supporting young talent. Prior to this, there had been no award recognition for comedy shows on the Fringe. The Scotsman had introduced Fringe Firsts in 1973 for theatre. However, revues, then the dominant type of comedy at the Fringe, were excluded. The first Perrier in fact advertised itself as for the \\"most outstanding revue\\", thus overlooking stand-up, which was beginning to emerge as a force due to the influence of the alternative comedy scene. The inaugural award and ¬£1,000 prize was presented to the Cambridge Footlights, a cast that included Stephen Fry, Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie and Tony Slattery. Their show, entitled The Cellar Tapes played at St Mary Street Hall and was promoted in the programme with the line, \\"one of the strongest casts for several years, has already toured in southern England with great success.\\" The award was presented by Rowan Atkinson, who had performed with the Oxford Revue in 1976. The later success of these initial winners would boost the profile of the awards. However, former Oxbridge revue members had always been able to find success in light entertainment, so the effect of the award on their careers may be exaggerated. Nonetheless, the 1981 Award retains symbolic power for new comedians wanting to find fame at the Fringe. Many other award winners and nominees have gone on to forge successful careers in comedy and the media industry including Lee Evans, Milton Jones, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace creators Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness, double act Alexander Armstrong and Ben Miller, QI panellist Alan Davies and Mock the Week panellist Chris Addison. Australian Comedian Brendon Burns has said that he is \\"arguably the least successful winner\\" of the award. A stand-up first won the award in 1987. A Best Newcomer Award was added in 1992, won by Harry Hill, and in 2006 the inaugural Panel Prize was won by Mark Watson. The panel prize was awarded to 'all performers' in 2008, and the ¬£4,000 prize money was put behind their bar at the end of August party. 2013 was the first year that all three awards went to shows in Independent venues outside the so-called 'big four. John Kearns (PBH) won Best Newcomer, Bridget Christie (The Stand) won Best Show and Adrienne Truscott (Heroes @ Bob's Bookshop) won the panel prize. In 2014, John Kearns became the first comedian to win Best Newcomer and Best Comedy Show in consecutive years. In 2017, for the first time, two awards were given for Best Show (John Robins and Hannah Gadsby). No panel prize was awarded in 2017. In 2018, Rose Matafeo became the first person of colour to win Best Comedy Show for a solo show, and the first New Zealander to win the award. Only four other female solo stand-up comedians had won the award before her: Jenny Eclair (1995), Laura Solon (2005), Bridget Christie (2013), and Hannah Gadsby (2017). Sponsorship From their inception in 1981 until 2005 the awards were sponsored by mineral water brand Perrier, during which time they were known as the Perrier Comedy Awards. Sponsorship then passed to the Scottish-based bank Intelligent Finance and for 2006, the first year of their involvement, the awards were known as the if.comeddies, changing to the if.comedy awards for 2007 and 2008. In March 2009 Intelligent Finance announced it would not be renewing its sponsorship deal. The 2009 awards were known as the Edinburgh Comedy Award, sponsored by AbsoluteRadio.co.uk. From 2010 until 2015 the awards were sponsored by Foster's Lager. From 2016 the awards have been sponsored by lastminute.com until 2019 when Dave began to sponsor the awards. In order to avoid confusion due to the frequency of name changes, past winners are now often said to have won \\"the Eddie\\", a popular colloquial term for the award, rather than referring to a specific year's sponsor. Controversy=Nestl√© In 1995, Perrier was bought by Nestl√©, the subject of a long- running boycott based on alleged violations of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, leading to calls to boycott or to eliminate the awards taken up by some Fringe venues and performers, including former winners Emma Thompson, Steve Coogan, Stewart Lee and Rob Newman, led a campaign of protest against the award, beginning in 2001, called Baby Milk Action. The Nestl√© boycott also led to the alternative Tap Water Awards which ran from 2001 to 2006, and aimed to promote access to safe supplies of drinking water and sanitation in developing countries; these awards were suspended for 2007 due to \\"having beaten Nestl√©\\". Multiple winners were chosen each year, including established comedians like Stewart Lee and Robert Newman, and, in the award's final year, promoter Peter Buckley Hill for his Free Fringe initiative. Inclusivity The 2002 awards were criticised because no female acts were shortlisted, the second consecutive year in which that was the case. In 2009, they were again criticised for all the nominees being male, as well as all being white, English and all performing at the same venue, The Pleasance.

He did not have the typical power associated with a corner infielder, never hitting more than two home runs in a season. Nonetheless, he was a valuable member of the White Sox of the early Tony La Russa era, particularly in their 1983 AL West championship run. On May 4, 1980, Squires became the first left-handed- throwing catcher in Major League Baseball since Dale Long in 1958 when he was shifted from first base in the ninth inning of an 11-1 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers at Comiskey Park.Milwaukee Brewers 11, Chicago White Sox 1; Sunday, May 4, 1980 at Comiskey Park (box score) - Retrosheet He would go behind home plate one more time three days later on the same homestand, coming off the bench in the ninth inning of a 12-5 defeat to the Kansas City Royals.Kansas City Royals 12, Chicago White Sox 5; Wednesday, May 7, 1980 at Comiskey Park (box score) - Retrosheet He replaced Bruce Kimm in both instances.

General Gang Jo was a general in charge of the Northern border army. Rise to power When scholar- official Kim Chi-yang burned the royal palace to the ground, threatening to kill the king and take over, King Mokjong called General Gang Jo to the capital city of Kaesong. General Gang Jo immediately executed Kim Chi-Yang and his supporters. Then, the scholar officials, enemies of Gang Jo, spread rumors and lies that the general was planning to take over the government for himself. These rumors reached the King, and he planned to kill Gang Jo. Gang Jo heard of the conspiracy and doubts of the King, and ordered his army to attack and kill all of his enemies, including the King. After assassinating King Mokjong, General Gang placed King Hyeonjong of Goryeo on the throne. War with the Liao and death Soon after this, Emperor Shengzong of Liao attacked Goryeo during the fall of 1010 in an attempt to kill Gang Jo for killing the Goryeo King. According to the Korean source, 400,000-man Liao army invaded Goryeo territory. Liao first attacked but failed to capture the fort of Hueng hwa, whose lord was General Yang Gyu. Next, the Liao finally headed to the city of Tong-Ju, which is where General Gang Jo and 30,000 Goryeo troops were waiting. General Gang Jo set up an ambush on a narrow pass that the Liao army was inevitably going to have to pass. There, he directly led his troops in a three-pronged attack when the Liao came. The Liao soldiers were forced to retreat and 10,000 died during this ambush. The enemy troops again attacked Tong-Ju city but faced a humiliating defeat with severe casualties. The Liao commander launched another attack on the city, with Gang Jo as his main target. The Liao were defeated a third time, and were forced to retreat once more. In one last-ditch effort, the Liao army came attacking once more, but this time, General Gang Jo did not directly orchestrate the attack and played Badok with one of his lieutenants instead, thinking that victory was a given. In the same time, Liao general Yelupennu led the Khitan army to attack and capture the Sanshu fortress. However, after hearing the source Gang Jo did not take any measures to defend Khitan force. Then one of Gang Jo's men told his plan to the Liao. Liao soldiers pierced through the city's defenses. After the Khitan army launched a surprise attack, the Goryeo army was defeated, finally 30,000 Goryeo soldiers were killed and Gang Jo was captured. General Gang refused to surrender to the Liao Emperor, who in turn executed Gang. Place in history and comparison to Yeon Gaesommun Gang Jo is seen as a hero. Though his rule was a time of war against the invading Liao, not many deaths were ordered by the general with the exception of King Mokjong and the conspiring scholar-officials. Gang Jo can be compared with his predecessor Yeon Gaesomun of Goguryeo, who had also killed a King of Goguryeo for conspiring against him. Gang Jo, however, was not as brilliant as Yeon Gaesommun, as he was not able to keep control for very long. Gang Jo did bring great victories to Goryeo over the Liao dynasty, but his death brought about another period of trouble for Goryeo, just as Yeon Gaesommun's death had done to Goguryeo. Gang Jo can be seen as a smaller-scale version of Yeon Gaesomun. In popular culture * Portrayed by Choi Jae-sung in the 2009 KBS2 TV series Empress Cheonchu.

An 18th-century engraving after a 15th-century painting. Three baronetcies have been created in the Baronetage of England for members of the Littleton or Lyttelton family. All three lines are descended from Thomas de Littleton, a noted 15th-century jurist. Despite differences in spelling of the title, the names of all three lines were spelt in many varied ways in the early modern period, without distinction between the different branches of the family. This can be confusing, as the range of forenames in use was very limited. Origins The Littleton family had its origins in South Lyttleton, near Evesham, Worcestershire. With the marriage of the heiress Elizabeth Littleton to Thomas Westcote, esquire, two of Elizabeth's sons, Sir Thomas and Edmund, took the surname Lyttleton or Littleton while two others, Nicholas and Guy, retained the earlier surname; Nicholas Westcote married Agnes Vernon, the daughter and heiress of Edmund Vernon, and was ancestor of the Westcotes of Staffordshire, while Guy married the daughter of one Greenevill of Gloucestershire, and was ancestor of the Westcotes of Devon and Somerset.. Edmund Littleton died unmarried. Thomas de Littleton became 'one of the great law luminaries of his country, and is immortalized by one work alone, his celebrated Treatise on Tenures.. He was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1464, and was created a Knight of the Bath in 1475. He inherited the Frankley estates from his mother. He married Joan Burley, a wealthy heiress, who was the widow of Philip Chetwynd V of Ingestre, Staffordshire. They had three sons, William, Richard and Thomas, from whom originated three lines of landed gentry in the West Midlands, all of which acquired baronetcies in the 17th century. The Lyttelton baronets of Frankley The greater part of the wealth of Thomas and Joan passed to their eldest son, Sir William Littleton of Frankley, Worcestershire. The Frankley line acquired a baronetcy on 25 June 1618. With the fifth baronet, the title was subsumed into that of Baron Lyttelton. The Littletons of Pillaton Hall Remains of Pillaton Old Hall, near Penkridge, Staffordshire. The original moated manor house became ruinous, but the Gatehouse and Chapel were restored in the 1880s. Richard married Alice Winesbury or Wynnesbury, heiress of Pillaton Hall, near Penkridge, in Staffordshire. Their eldest son, Edward, inherited Alice's lands and was vigorous in acquiring lands on Cannock Chase as it was finally deforested. He was appointed Constable of Stafford Castle for life and was High Sheriff of Staffordshire on three occasions. He was the first of the line to be knighted. All subsequent Pillaton heirs were named Edward. The Baronetcy of Littleton of Pillaton Hall was created for Edward Littleton, of Pillaton Hall, on 28 June 1627. The Baronetcy became extinct in 1812 on the death of the 4th Baronet, who had moved the seat of the family to Teddesley Hall and whose heir was a nephew, Edward John Walhouse. The latter adopted the Littleton name and inherited both the Littleton lands and the Walhouse lands and investments. A prominent politician, he became Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton.

(sometimes written DuBois)He signed it both ways, both capitalized: as two words, and as one word with a capital \\"B\\". (August 24, 1899 ‚Äì October 20, 1993)\\"United States Social Security Death Index,\\" index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/JYMM-L4W : accessed 12 Mar 2013), Gaylord M Dubois, 20 October 1993. was an American writer of comic book stories and comic strips, as well as Big Little Books and juvenile adventure novels. Du Bois wrote Tarzan for Dell Comics and Gold Key Comics from 1946 until 1971, and wrote over 3,000 comics stories over his career. An avid outdoorsman, Du Bois had a true affinity for writing stories with natural settings. His forte was in Westerns, as well as jungle comics and animal reality comics. He created many original second features for Western Publishing (e.g., \\"Captain Venture: Beneath the Sea\\", \\"Leopard Girl\\", \\"Two Against the Jungle\\", etc.), but most of his work for the company was in writing stories with licensed characters. Comic strips and comic books Among the various genres for which he wrote comic book scripts, most were of the outdoor adventure variety, particularly Westerns, including Red Ryder Comics (for which he wrote \\"Little Beaver\\" text pages, The Fighting Yanks WWII feature, and, particularly, the \\"Kyotee Kids\\" Western series, 31 scripts, the first being sent to his editor 12/23/1946, the last being sent 3/19/1949, that ran from about issue #43 ending with #72; Du Bois had previously been one of the ghostwriters for the Red Ryder newspaper comic strip drawn by Fred Harman. Before its format change to all-new Red Ryder material, Red Ryder Comics featured Red Ryder newspaper strip reprints. He also wrote stories for Gene Autry Comics, Roy Rogers Comics (1944-1956, 1959-1960, all of the first run in the Four Color Comics series, and, under its own numbering, Roy Rogers Comics #1 through about #108, and approximately #134 through #143), Zane Grey's King of the Royal Mounted (Du Bois had previously been one of the ghost-writers for the King of the Royal Mounted newspaper comic strip drawn by illustrator Jim Gary), Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, Bat Masterson (adapting Bat Masterson (TV series)), Tales of Wells Fargo / Man from Wells Fargo, Wanted: Dead or Alive, The Rebel, Bonanza and Hotel de Paree Sundance. Gaylord Du Bois also wrote comic book script adaptations of Zane Grey's western novels for the Dell Four Color Series' \\"Zane Grey's\\" issues, which achieved its own numbering with #27 as \\"Zane Grey's Stories of the West.\\" Du Bois wrote the first issue. In total, he wrote 31 of the series' 39 issues. Du Bois excelled writing animals: he wrote the entire run of The Lone Ranger's Famous Horse Hi-Yo Silver, the entire run of National Velvet under both the Dell and Gold Key imprints, the first 9 issues of Roy Rogers' Trigger, the first 2 issues of Lassie the 4th issue, and issues #45-63, plus nine Lassie issues of March of Comics, the last issue of Gene Autry's Champion, as well as the animal adventure back-up features Bullet the dog, Lotor the raccoon, Yukon King the dog, Grey Wolf, Blaze the horse, et al.. He also adapted Owd Bob for Four Color Comics #729. Du Bois created several American Indian features: \\"Young Hawk\\" ran as a back- up feature in Dell's The Lone Ranger #11-#145 (1949-1962). It had first begun in The Funnies, and then appeared in New Funnies, both in 1942. Since Du Bois's pre-1943 Account Books were lost in a house fire, we can only guess that he created Young Hawk. Turok, Son of Stone was created by Du Bois, originally as a Young Hawk one-shot, but Young Hawk and Little Buck were renamed to be Turok and Andar. (Du Bois wrote the first 8 issues.) He also created the American Indian feature The Chief, the first issue of which debuted in Four Color #290, August, 1950. It assumed its own numbering with #2, April, 1951. The title changed to Indian Chief with #3, August, 1951. Gaylord Du Bois wrote all or nearly all the stories for the first four issues. (His stock of remaining scripts were used in at least three later issues (#12,13, and one other), but they mostly appeared in \\"Indian Chief\\" issues of March of Comics.) In Hi-Yo Silver, the recurring human character is Keenay, an American Indian. Du Bois's early comic-book -writing career included many cartoon characters, including Raggedy Ann, Andy Panda, Our Gang, Tom and Jerry and Uncle Wiggily. Additionally he wrote scripts for Dell Junior Treasury (2,3,4,5,6,8), Santa Claus Funnies, Frosty the Snowman, Walt Scott's Little People, The Littlest Snowman, Jungle Jim, Space Family Robinson (which spawned Lost in Space TV show) (Gaylord Du Bois became the sole writer of Space Family Robinson once he began chronicling the Robinsons' adventures with Peril on Planet Four in issue #8. He had already begun the Captain Venture second feature beginning with Situation Survival in issue #6.) Du Bois also chronicled the adventures of his own creations, e.g. Turok, Son of Stone, Brothers of the Spear, and Jungle Twins. Gaylord Du Bois wrote script adaptations to comic book form of motion pictures, for the Dell Four Color Series \\"Movie Classics\\" issues. His movie adaptations included: Robin Hood (Disney-Movie) (Four Color #413, 1952), Quentin Durward (Four Color #672, 1956), The Animal World (Four Color #713, 1956), Around the World in Eighty Days (Four Color #784, 1957), The Story of Mankind (Four Color #851, 1958), Seventh Voyage of Sinbad (Four Color #944, 1958), Last Train from Gun Hill (Four Color #1012, 1959), The Horse Soldiers (Four Color #1048, 1959), Solomon and Sheba (Four Color #1070, 1959), Spartacus (Four Color #1139, 1960), The Story of Ruth (Four Color #1144, 1960), North to Alaska (Four Color #1155, 1960), Master of the World (Four Color #1157, 1961), Dondi (Four Color #1176, 1962), Pepe (Four Color #1194, 1961); and Lord Jim (Gold Key #10156-509, 1965). Additionally, he wrote adaptations to comic book form of the TV series Marlin Perkins' Zoo Parade, and Lowell Thomas' High Adventure. He also wrote many one-shot comics, including the Dell Giant comics Abraham Lincoln, Moses and the Ten Commandments, and The Treasury of Dogs that won him the Thomas Alva Edison Award in 1956.Scott, Randall: \\"Gaylord Dubois Account Books sorted by Title\\", compiled from original account books, Michigan State University Libraries, 1985Essex County News, Reeseville, NY, Vol 50, Number 33, April 13, 1956 A devout Christian, Du Bois co-authored Biblical Cartoons from Daily Life! with Phil Saint in 1981.

Western saddle at Garza County Historical Museum in Post, Texas, United States The saddle is a supportive structure for a rider or other load, fastened to an animal's back by a girth. The most common type is the equestrian saddle designed for a horse. However, specialized saddles have been created for oxen, camels and other creatures.

The solid saddle tree was a later invention, and though early stirrup designs predated the invention of the solid tree. The paired stirrup, which attached to the tree, was the last element of the saddle to reach the basic form that is still used today. Today, modern saddles come in a wide variety of styles, each designed for a specific equestrianism discipline, and require careful fit to both the rider and the horse. Proper saddle care can extend the useful life of a saddle, often for decades. The saddle was a crucial step in the increased use of domesticated animals, during the Classical Era. Etymology The word \\"saddle\\" originates from the Proto-Germanic language *sathulaz, with cognates in various other Indo-European languages,Online Etymology Dictionary including the Latin sella.An Illustrated History of Arms and Armour, Authors Auguste Demmin, Publisher Echo Library, 2008 , , 9781848300491 P.355  Parts of an equestrian saddle Parts of an English saddle The tree of a western saddle *Tree: the base on which the rest of the saddle is built - usually based on wood or a similar synthetic material. The saddler eventually covers it with leather or with a leather-like synthetic. The tree's size determines its fit on the horse's back, as well as the size of the seat for the rider. It provides a bearing surface to protect the horse from the weight of the rider. The solid saddle tree raises the rider above the horse's back, and distributes the rider's weight, reducing the pounds per square inch carried on any one part of the horse's back, thus greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life.Bennett (1998) *Seat: the part of the saddle where the rider sits, it is usually lower than the pommel and cantle to provide security *Pommel or Pomnel (English)/ Swells (Western): the front, slightly raised area of the saddle. *Cantle: the rear of the saddle *Stirrup: part of the saddle in which the rider's feet are placed; provides support and leverage to the rider. *Leathers and Flaps (English), or Fenders (Western): The leather straps connecting the stirrups to the saddle tree and leather flaps giving support to the rider's leg and protecting the rider from sweat. *D-ring: a \\"D\\"-shaped ring on the front of a saddle, to which certain pieces of equipment (such as breastplates) can be attached. *Girth or Cinch: A wide strap that goes under the horse's barrel, just behind the front legs of the horse that holds the saddle on. *Panels, Lining, or Padding: Cushioning on the underside of the saddle. In addition to the above basic components, some saddles also include: *Surcingle: A long strap that goes all the way around the horse's barrel. Depending on purpose, may be used by itself, placed over a pad or blanket only, or placed over a saddle (often in addition to a girth) to help hold it on. *Monkey grip or less commonly Jug handle: a handle that may be attached to the front of European saddles or on the right side of Australian stock saddle. A rider may use it to help maintain their seat or to assist in mounting. *Horn: knob-like appendage attached to the pommel or swells, most commonly associated with the modern western saddle, but seen on some saddle designs in other cultures. *knee rolls: Seen on some English saddles , extra padding on the front of the flaps to help stabilize the rider's leg. Sometimes thigh rolls are also added to the back of the flap. History and development There is evidence, though disputed, that humans first began riding the horse not long after domestication, possibly as early as 4000 BC.Anthony, David and Brown, Dorcas. \\"Horses and Humans in Antiquity\\" Hartwick College. Accessed May 29, 2012 The earliest known saddle-like equipment were fringed cloths or pads used by Assyrian cavalry around 700 BC. These were held on with a girth or surcingle that included breast straps and cruppers.Beatie, Russel H. Saddles, University of Oklahoma Press, 1981 , , 9780806115849 P.18-22 From the earliest depictions, saddles became status symbols. To show off an individual's wealth and status, embellishments were added to saddles, including elaborate sewing and leather work, precious metals such as gold, carvings of wood and horn, and other ornamentation. The North Iranian Eurasian nomads known in Europe as Scythians and in Asia as Saka developed an early form of saddle with a rudimentary frame, which included two parallel leather cushions, with girth attached to them, a pommel and cantle with detachable bone/horn/hardened leather facings, leather thongs, a crupper, breastplate, and a felt shabrack adorned with animal motifs. These were located in Pazyryk burials finds.\\"State Hermitage Museum: Southern Siberia/Pazyryk\\" . These saddles, found in the Ukok Plateau, Siberia were dated to 500-400 BC.

The Scythians also developed an early saddle that included padding and decorative embellishments. Though they had neither a solid tree nor stirrups, these early treeless saddles and pads provided protection and comfort to the rider, with a slight increase in security. The Sarmatians also used a padded treeless early saddle, possibly as early as the seventh century BC Maenchen-Helfen, Otto. The World of the Huns: Studies in Their History and Culture, University of California Press, 1973 p. 208-210 and depictions of Alexander the Great depict a saddle cloth. Early solid-treed saddles were made of felt that covered a wooden frame. Asian designs appeared during the Han dynasty approximately 200 BC. One of the earliest solid-treed saddles in the west was the \\"four horn\\" design, first used by the Romans as early as the 1st century BC.Gawronski R. S. \\"Some Remarks on the Origins and Construction of the Roman Military Saddle.\\" Archeologia (Archaeology) 2004, vol: 55, pages: 31-40 Neither design had stirrups. Reconstructed Roman military saddle (4-horn design) The development of the solid saddle tree was significant; it raised the rider above the horse's back, and distributed the rider's weight on either side of the animal's spine instead of pinpointing pressure at the rider's seat bones, reducing the pressure (force per unit area) on any one part of the horse's back, thus greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life. The invention of the solid saddle tree also allowed development of the true stirrup as it is known today.Bennett, Deb. Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship. Amigo Publications Inc; 1st edition 1998, p. 100. Without a solid tree, the rider's weight in the stirrups creates abnormal pressure points and makes the horse's back sore. Thermography studies on \\"treeless\\" and flexible tree saddle designs have found that there is considerable friction across the center line of a horse's back.West, Christy. \\"AAEP 2004: Evaluating Saddle Fit.\\" TheHorse.com, February 04 2005, Article # 5393 Web site accessed February 2, 2008 The stirrup was one of the milestones in saddle development. The first stirrup-like object was invented in India in the 2nd century BC, and consisted of a simple leather strap in which the rider's toe was placed. It offered very little support, however. The nomadic tribes in northern China are thought to have been the inventors of the modern stirrup, but the first dependable representation of a rider with paired stirrups was found in China in a Jin Dynasty tomb of about AD 302.\\"The stirrup - history of Chinese science.\\" UNESCO Courier, October, 1988 The stirrup appeared to be in widespread use across China by 477 AD,Hobson, John M. The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation. Cambridge University Press,2004, p. 103 , and later spread to Europe. This invention gave great support for the rider, and was essential in later warfare. Post-classical West Africa Accounts of the cavalry system of the Mali Empire describe the use of stirrups and saddles in the cavalry . Stirrups and Saddles brought about innovation in new tactics, such as mass charges with thrusting spears and swords. Middle Ages A saddle commonly seen in the 16th and 17th centuries Saddles were improved upon during the Middle Ages, as knights needed saddles that were stronger and offered more support. The resulting saddle had a higher cantle and pommel (to prevent the rider from being unseated in warfare) and was built on a wooden tree that supported more weight from a rider with armor and weapons. This saddle, a predecessor to the modern Western saddle, was originally padded with wool or horsehair and covered in leather or textiles. It was later modified for cattle tending and bullfighting in addition to the continual development for use in war. Other saddles, derived from earlier, treeless designs, sometimes added solid trees to support stirrups, but were kept light for use by messengers and for horse racing. Development of the modern saddle The English hunting saddle The saddle eventually branched off into different designs that became the modern English and Western saddles. One variant of the English saddle was developed by Fran√ßois Robinchon de la Gu√©rini√®re, a French riding master and author of \\"Ecole de Cavalerie\\" who made major contributions to what today is known as classical dressage. He put great emphasis on the proper development of a \\"three point\\" seat that is still used today by many dressage riders. In the 18th century, fox hunting became increasingly popular in England. The high-cantle, high-pommel design of earlier saddles became a hindrance, unsafe and uncomfortable for riders as they jumped. Due to this fact, Gu√©rini√®re's saddle design which included a low pommel and cantle and allowed for more freedom of movement for both horse and rider, became increasingly popular throughout northern Europe. In the early 20th century, Captain Frederico Caprilli revolutionized the jumping saddle by placing the flap at an angle that allowed a rider to achieve the forward seat necessary for jumping high fences and traveling rapidly across rugged terrain. The modern Western saddle was developed from the Spanish saddles that were brought by the Spanish Conquistadors when they came to the Americas. These saddles were adapted to suit the needs of vaqueros and cowboys of Mexico, Texas and California, including the addition of a horn that allowed a lariat to be tied or dallied for the purpose of holding cattle and other livestock. Types of modern equestrian saddle In the Western world there are two basic types of saddles used today for horseback riding, usually called the English saddle and the \\"stock\\" saddle. The best known stock saddle is the American western saddle, followed by the Australian stock saddle. In Asia and throughout the world, there are numerous saddles of unique designs used by various nationalities and ethnic groups. English saddle A Hunt Seat style English saddle English saddles are used for English riding throughout the world, not just in England or English-speaking countries. They are the saddles used in all of the Olympic equestrian disciplines. The term English saddle encompasses several different styles of saddle, including those used for eventing, show jumping and hunt seat, dressage, saddle seat, horse racing, horse surfing and polo. The major distinguishing feature of an English saddle is its flatter appearance, the lack of a horn, and the self-padding design of the panels: a pair of pads attached to the underside of the seat and filled with wool, foam, or air. However, the length and angle of the flaps, the depth of the seat and height of the cantle all play a role in the use for which a particular saddle is intended. The \\"tree\\" that underlies the saddle is usually one of the defining features of saddle quality. Traditionally, the tree of an English saddle is built of laminated layers of high quality wood reinforced with spring steel along its length, with a riveted gullet plate. These trees are semi-adjustable and are considered \\"spring trees\\". They have some give, but a minimum amount of flexibility. More recently, saddle manufacturers are using various materials to replace wood and create a synthetic molded tree (some with the integrated spring steel and gullet plate, some without). Synthetic materials vary widely in quality. Polyurethane trees are often very well-made, but some cheap saddles are made with fiberglass trees of limited durability. Synthetic trees are often lighter, more durable, and easier to customize. Some designs are intended to be more flexible and move with the horse. Several companies offer flexible trees or adjustable gullets that allow the same saddle to be used on different sizes of horses. Stock saddles A Western-style saddle Western saddles are saddles originally designed to be used on horses on working cattle ranches in the United States. Used today in a wide variety of western riding activities, they are the \\"cowboy saddles\\" familiar to movie viewers, rodeo fans, and those who have gone on tourist trail rides. The Western saddle has no padding of its own, and must be used with a saddle blanket or pad in order to provide a comfortable fit for the horse. It also has sturdier stirrups and uses a cinch rather than a girth. Its most distinctive feature is the horn on the front of the saddle, originally used to dally a lariat when roping cattle. Other nations such as Australia and Argentina have stock saddles that usually do not have a horn, but have other features commonly seen in a western saddle, including a deep seat, high cantle, and heavier leather. The tree of a western saddle is the most critical component, defining the size and shape of the finished product. The tree determines both the width and length of the saddle as it sits on the back of the horse, as well as the length of the seat for the rider, width of the swells (pommel), height of cantle, and, usually, shape of the horn. Traditional trees were made of wood or wood laminate covered with rawhide and this style is still manufactured today, though modern synthetic materials are also used. Leather is stretched and molded around the tree, with minimal padding between the tree and the exterior leather, usually a bit of relatively thin padding on the seat, and a sheepskin cover on the underside of the skirts to prevent chafing and rubbing on the horse. Though a western saddle is often considerably heavier than an English saddle, the tree is designed to spread out the weight of the rider and any equipment the rider may be carrying so that there are fewer pounds per square inch on the horse's back and, when properly fitted, few if any pressure points. Thus, the design, in spite of its weight, can be used for many hours with relatively little discomfort to a properly conditioned horse and rider. Military saddles A McClellan cavalry saddle, used by the United States Army in the late 1800s British Universal Pattern military saddles were used by the mounted forces from Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.Australian Light Horse Association Retrieved on 26 March 2009 The Steel Arch Universal Pattern Mark I was issued in 1891. This was found to irritate riders and in 1893 it was discontinued in favour of the Mark II. In 1898, the Mark III appeared, which had the addition of a V-shaped arrangement of strap billets on the sideboards for the attachment of the girth. This girthing system could be moved forward or back to obtain an optimum fit on a wide range of horses. From 1902 the Universal Military Saddle was manufactured with a fixed tree, broad panels to spread the load, and initially a front arch in three sizes. The advantage of this saddle was its lightness, ease of repair and comfort for horse and rider. From 1912 the saddle was built on an adjustable tree and consequently only one size was needed. Its advantage over the fixed tree 1902 pattern was its ability to maintain a better fit on the horse's back as the horse gained or lost weight. This saddle was made using traditional methods and featured a seat blocked from sole leather, which maintained its shape well.Universal Pattern 1902 Commonwealth Military Saddle Retrieved on 26 March 2009 Military saddles were fitted with metal staples and dees to carry a sword, spare horse shoes and other equipment. In the US, the McClellan saddle was introduced in the 1850s by George B. McClellan for use by the United States Cavalry, and the core design was used continuously, with some improvements, until the 1940s. Today, the McClellan saddle continues to be used by ceremonial mounted units in the U.S. Army. The basic design that inspired McClellan saw use by military units in several other nations, including Rhodesia and Mexico, and even to a degree by the British in the Boer War. Military saddles are still produced and are now used in exhibitions, parades and other events. Asian saddle A Central Asian saddle from Kashgar, China. Saddles in Asia date to the time of the Scythians and Cimmerians. Modern Asian saddles can be divided into two groups: Saddles from Central Asia, which have a prominent horn and leather covering, and saddles from East Asia, which have a high pommel and cantle. Central Asian saddles are noted for their wide seats and high horns. The saddle has a base of wood with a thin leather covering that frequently has a lacquer finish. Central Asian saddles have no pad and must be ridden with a saddle blanket. The horn comes in particular good use during the rough horseback sport of buskashi, played throughout Central Asia, which involves two teams of riders wrestling over a decapitated goat's carcass. Saddles from East Asia differ from Central Asian saddles by their high pommel and cantle and lack of a horn. East Asian saddles can be divided into several types that are associated with certain nationalities and ethnic groups. Saddles used by the Han Chinese are noted by their use of inlay work for ornamentation. Tibetan saddles typically employ iron covers inlaid with precious metals on the pommel and cantle and universally come with padding. Mongolian saddles are similar to the Tibetan style except that they are typically smaller and the seat has a high ridge. Saddles from ethnic minority groups in China's southwest, such as in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, have colorful lacquer work over a leather covering. =Japanese saddles= Japanese saddle Japanese saddles are classified as Chinese-style (karagura) or Japanese-style (yamatogura). In the Nara period the Chinese style was adopted. Gradually the Japanese changed the saddle to suit their needs, and in the Heian period, the saddle typically associated with the samurai class was developed. These saddles, known as kura, were lacquered as protection from the weather. Early samurai warfare was conducted primarily on horseback and the kura provided a rugged, stable, comfortable platform for shooting arrows, but it was not well suited for speed or distance. In the Edo period horses were no longer needed for warfare and Japanese saddles became quite elaborate and were decorated with mother of pearl inlays, gold leaf, and designs in colored lacquer.Samurai, warfare and the state in early medieval Japan (Google eBook), Karl F. Friday, Psychology Press, 2004 P.97 Handbook to life in medieval and early modern Japan, William E. Deal, Oxford University Press US, 2007 P.155 Other A sidesaddle * Sidesaddle, designed originally as a woman's saddle that allowed a rider in a skirt to stay on and control a horse. Sidesaddle riding is still seen today in horse shows, fox hunting, parades and other exhibitions. *Trick (or stunt) riding saddles are similar to western saddles and have a tall metal horn, low front and back, reinforced hand holds and extended double rigging for a wide back girth. * Endurance riding saddle, a saddle designed to be comfortable to the horse with broad panels but lightweight design, as well as comfortable for the rider over long hours of riding over challenging terrain. * Police saddle, similar to an English saddle in general design, but with a tree that provides greater security to the rider and distributes a rider's weight over a greater area so that the horse is comfortable with a rider on its back for long hours. * McClellan saddle, a specific American cavalry model that entered service just before the Civil War with the United States Army. It was designed with an English-type tree, but with a higher pommel and cantle. Also, the area upon which the rider sits was divided into two sections with a gap between the two panels. * Pack saddle, similar to a cavalry saddle in the simplicity of its construction, but intended solely for the support of heavy bags or other objects being carried by the horse. * Double seat saddles have two pairs of stirrups and two deep padded seats for use when double-banking or riding double with a child behind an adult rider. The western variety has one horn on the front of the saddle. * Treeless saddle, available in both Western and English designs, but not built upon a solid saddle tree, intended to be flexible and comfortable on a variety of horses, but also not always able to provide the weight support of a solid tree. The use of an appropriate saddle pad is essential for treeless saddles. (See Controversy section, below) * A flexible saddle uses a traditional tree, but the panels are not permanently attached to the finished saddle. These saddles use flexible panels (the part that sits along the horse's back) that are moveable and adjustable to provide a custom fit for the horse and allow for changes of placement as the horse's body develops. * Bareback pad, usually a simple pad in the shape of an English-style saddle pad, made of cordura nylon or leather, padded with fleece, wool or synthetic foam, equipped with a girth. It is used as an alternative to bareback riding to provide padding for both horse and rider and to help keep the rider's clothing a bit cleaner. Depending on materials, bareback pads offer a bit more grip to the rider's seat and legs. However, though some bareback pads come with handles and even stirrups, without being attached to a saddle tree, these appendages are unsafe and pads with them should be avoided. In some cases, the addition of stirrups without a supporting tree place pressure on the horse's spinous processes, potentially causing damage. Fitting Comparison of the undersides of a western saddle (back) and an English saddle (front) A saddle, regardless of type, must fit both horse and rider. Saddle fitting is an art and in ideal circumstances is performed by a professional saddlemaker or saddle fitter. Custom-made saddles designed for an individual horse and rider will fit the best, but are also the most expensive. However, many manufactured saddles provide a decent fit if properly selected, and some minor adjustments can be made. Fitting the horse The debate about the definition of a fitting saddle is still controversial; however, there is a general rule for fitting that no damage should occur to the horse's skin and no injury should be presented to any muscular or neural tissues beneath the saddle. Width of the saddle is the primary means by which a saddle is measured and fitted to a horse, though length of tree and proper balance must also be considered. The gullet of a saddle must clear the withers of the horse, but yet must not be so narrow as to pinch the horse's back. The tree must be positioned so that the tree points (English) or bars (Western) do not interfere with the movement of the horse's shoulder. The seat of the saddle must be positioned so that the rider, when riding correctly, is placed over the horse's center of balance. The bars of the saddle must not be so long that they place pressure beyond the last rib of the horse. A too-short tree alone does not usually create a problem, as shorter trees are most often on saddles made for children, though a short tree with an unbalanced adult rider may create abnormal pressure points. While a horse's back can be measured for size and shape, the saddle must be tried on the individual animal to assure proper fit. Saddle blankets or pads can provide assistance to correct minor fit problems, but no amount of padding can compensate for a poor-fitting saddle. The common problems associated with saddle fitting problems are: bridging, ill-fitting headplates and incorrect stuffing of the panels. One saddle simply cannot fit all animals. Nor will a saddle fit even the same horse forever without adjustments. As a horse advances in conditioning, age, and training, the back muscles and even the underlying skeletal structures change to some degree. Thus, particularly with English saddles, a saddle fitter needs to make periodic adjustments. Western saddles are more difficult to adjust, though use of shims and padding can compensate for some changes. A lower pressure per square inch of surface area is a bit more forgiving. In some cases, a horse will physically develop to a degree that a different saddle may have to be purchased. Fitting the rider Method of fitting riders varies tremendously between designs. Length of the seat is the most common method by which saddles are fitted, though the length and placement of the flaps or fenders of the saddle also influence a person's leg position and thus the way an individual sits. While a too long or too short seat will cause considerable discomfort, and even interfere with the security of the rider on the horse, width is also a factor. Any well-fitting saddle should be wide enough to support the rider's seat bones, without being so wide as to cause discomfort. While saddles are not usually marketed by seat width, designs do vary, and the only way a rider can determine the proper fit of a saddle is to sit on one. Balance is also a critical factor. A properly balanced saddle places the rider over the horse's center of balance for the equestrian discipline involved. A poor-fitting saddle often leaves a rider feeling that they are sliding backwards and constantly attempting to move \\"uphill.\\" Less often, a poor-fitting saddle shifts the rider too far forward and creates a sensation of being pushed onto the horse's neck. Stirrup fit varies greatly between disciplines, from the very short stirrup of the horse racing jockey to the long stirrup of the dressage or reining competitor. However, in all cases, the stirrup leather must be properly placed so that the rider remains in balance over the saddle and is not thrown ahead or behind the motion of the horse when putting weight in the stirrups. Care of a saddle All saddles need to be kept clean and dry. They need to be stored under cover, away from weather and dust. Ideally they should be stored in an area where they are kept at a slightly cool but consistent temperature, though the practical need to keep saddles near horses may make temperature-controlled storage difficult. Saddles also need to be kept away from a direct heat source, such as a furnace duct or heater, as excess heat, especially driven by a fan, will dry out the leather. For the same reason, if leather gets wet, it must be allowed to dry naturally, away from a direct heat source. A properly cared-for saddle can last for many decades, even with regular use. Cleaning is an important part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing on the horse. Sweat and dirt also tend to cause cracking in leather, which may result in breaking. This not only decreases the value of the saddle, but can be very dangerous if critical equipment, such as a stirrup leather, breaks mid-ride. Proper care and conditioning of the saddle will not only increase its useful life, but will also help to retain its value. A saddle should be cleaned regularly if it used for work. It is usually easiest to clean a saddle when placed on a moveable saddle rack. Ideally, a rider should quickly wipe down the saddle after every ride with a slightly damp, but not wet, sponge or cloth, in order to remove any dirt and sweat. Once a week, or after every 5‚Äì7 rides, a more thorough cleaning should be performed. Saddles are cleaned using saddle soap, followed by a conditioning (moisturizing) product that will restore the natural oils back into the leather. Saddle soap is used with only a minimal amount of water and suds or lather kept low, as getting the leather too wet may lead to a number of problems. In a dry climate, wet leather may dehydrate and crack, particularly if subjected to repeated wet-dry stresses. In a humid climate, excess water for cleaning creates an environment for rot and mold. Once a saddle is clean, a conditioner is used to restore moisture removed by the cleaning process. While glycerine-based saddle soaps have conditioning properties, it is usually important to remove most soap residue before conditioning to prevent product buildup on the leather. Saddles kept in storage also benefit from occasional conditioning to restore natural oils. While conditioning a saddle is an important element of saddle care, and critical in dry climates, over-oiling may rot jute or other natural fiber stitching, particularly in humid climates. Neatsfoot oil is one traditional conditioner, and products containing beeswax are popular in some areas, but there are also many other commercial blends of conditioning products available. Oil products tend to darken leather from its natural color. Sometimes this is desirable and sometimes not, depending on the desired shade of the leather. Strap parts of the saddle, such as the stirrup leathers, billets (on an English saddle) and latigo (on a western saddle) also need conditioning, but it varies by climate. In a dry climate, failure to oil straps may result in cracking and weakening of the leather, and they can snap or break. In a more humid climate, too much oil may weaken the leather. Properly conditioned leather is neither brittle nor floppy in texture and flexibility. Saddles made of synthetic materials can be cleaned using water and a mild cleaner and do not require conditioning. They will tolerate being washed with water without risk of drying out or damaging the material. While synthetics to date will not last as long as a well-cared for leather saddle, they withstand lack of cleaning and care as well as exposure to rain and dampness quite well. Before a horse show or other competition, the rider should take extra care to clean the saddle and polish all metal parts, including the D-rings, stirrups, stirrup bars and nailheads on an English saddle; and the buckles, dees, and ornamental silver on a Western saddle. Treeless saddle controversy Treeless and flexible tree saddles in both English and Western styles are becoming popular today, though there are controversies surrounding their use. Proponents argue that treeless and flex- tree saddles move more easily with a horse's dynamic motion and add shock absorbency between horse and rider. Treeless saddles are also easier to fit the horse, particularly in the area of the horse's scapula (shoulder blade). Opponents of treeless saddles argue that they create abnormal pressure points and over time can cause as many problems as an ill-fitting treed saddle. Flexible trees may be a compromise between the two camps, but manufacturing quality and design varies greatly. While flexible, adjustable trees are an alternate choice to traditional wooden trees, they carry limitations inherent in both solid tree and treeless designs. Controversy arises in part because, while treeless and flexible tree saddles have benefits for horses with injuries related to poorly-fitted treed saddles, only a solid tree or very well constructed treeless saddle with correct padding can keep the rider off the horse's spine and distribute weight evenly across the horse's back without creating localized pressure points. Pressure should never be put directly on the spinuous processes of the horse nor on the ligament system that runs alongside the spine, and many treeless designs do result in rider-related pressure in this area. Furthermore, bareback pads, which are often confused with treeless saddles, provide grip but no structural support to protect the horse's spine. However, a growing number of treeless saddle designs are composed of a system of panels with a wide channel for the spine, thus keeping pressure off the spinuous processes. Some treeless saddle designs may present problems for riders as well. Without a supportive tree over the horse's withers, a treeless saddle may place the rider behind the movement of the horse, creating pressure on the horse's loin and the rider's low back. Inadequate support may also lead to the rider's seat bones digging into the horse's back. Additionally, a solid tree supports the curvature of the rider's spine which is essential for communication between horse and rider.Treeless Saddles. Practical Horseman, Dec. 2008 On the other hand, many riders with preexisting back or hip problems are more comfortable in a treeless saddle due to the extra padding, adjustability and shock absorption. Treeless saddles have started to become popular in horse therapy and hippotherapy for this reason.

An altered book artist takes a book (old, new, recycled or multiple) and cuts, tears, glues, burns, folds, paints, adds to, collages, rebinds, gold-leafs, creates pop-ups, rubber- stamps, drills, bolts, and/or be-ribbons it. The artist may add pockets and niches to hold tags, rocks, ephemera, or other three-dimensional objects. Some change the shape of the book, or use multiple books in the creation of the finished piece of art. Altered books may be as simple as adding a drawing or text to a page, or as complex as creating an intricate book sculpture. Antique or Victorian art is frequently used, probably because it is easier to avoid copyright issues. Altered books are shown and sold in art galleries and on the Internet. An exhibition of altered books by contemporary artists was shown at the Bellevue Arts Museum in 2009, titled The Book Borrowers. It contained 31 works, books transformed into sculptural works.Bellevue Arts Museum website, accessed May 12, 2018 The John Michael Kohler Arts Center was to host an exhibition of altered books in early 2010. An interesting example of sculpture-like altered books can be found in the mysterious paper sculptures left in various cultural institutions in Scotland, such as the Scottish Poetry Library and the National Library of Scotland. Recycling old books and using them as art journals has also become popular with some art bloggers and proponents of upcycling.

The service was launched by MCI in 1993. $29.99 first 5 minutes/$2.99 each additional minute. History=Launch Prior to 1993, collect calling was a virtual monopoly held by AT&T; as people were accustomed to dialing \\"0\\" to place collect calls. MCI moved aggressively to insert itself into the market by launching 1-800-COLLECT that year. By dialing 1-800-COLLECT, customers could connect with an automated MCI system which would directly place a call to a designated receiving party for a fraction of the cost of the AT&T; service for its operator-assisted collect calling. According to Advertising Age, 1-800-COLLECT went from concept to launch in less than three months. Launched with a large marketing budget, within a year New York Magazine reported that MCI had \\"stamped 1-800-COLLECT onto our consciousness with a mammoth marketing blitz\\" aimed largely at Generation X consumers. Competition Following the successful launch of 1-800-COLLECT, AT&T; responded with a competing 1-800 phone number providing discounted collect calling, 1-800-OPERATOR. However, a significant portion of calls intended for 1-800-OPERATOR misspelled \\"Operator\\" as \\"Operater\\". The numerical translation for 1-800-OPERATER (1-800-673-7283) was, at the time, assigned for routing to the MCI network, which capitalized on the large number of spelling errors by connecting those calls to 1-800-COLLECT. After several months, AT&T; realized they were inadvertently directing a portion of their business to MCI and terminated the 1-800-OPERATOR service, replacing it with 1-800-CALL-ATT. The local telephone companies, who lost a significant amount of business to both numbers, started fighting back with ads showing how much simpler it was to just dial 0 (Ameritech's ad said \\"Why push 800 numbers when you can just push one?\\") or later pushing calling cards as an alternative to calling someone collect. Later years By the time of MCI's bankruptcy in 2002, its 1-800-COLLECT business had fallen precipitously due to the growing market penetration of mobile phones and the decreasing popularity of pay phones, which had generated a large portion of the collect calling business. After MCI was acquired by Verizon following the bankruptcy, the 1-800-COLLECT business was transferred to a small Verizon subsidiary, Telecom USA. Though the service's robust advertising budget was terminated, it continued to receive a trickle of business. In 2014 one caller, who \\"still associated the 1-800-COLLECT number with reasonable collect call rates... so strong were the company's early ads\\", reported being charged $42.55 for a six-minute telephone call. On November 1, 2016 Viiz Communications, a Canadian company, announced they had acquired 1-800-COLLECT for an undisclosed amount. Marketing 1-800-COLLECT advertising did not mention its connection to MCI in order to avoid confusion from persons who might otherwise believe they had to be MCI customers to use the service, as well as to attract AT&T; \\"loyalists\\" disinclined to patronize an MCI service. In 1994, 1-800-COLLECT became one of the first six brands to use banner ads as part of a marketing campaign, purchasing a flight of ads on hotwired.com. Beginning in 1994, MCI sponsored airshow pilot Sean D. Tucker under the 1-800-COLLECT brand.PR Newswire MCI ‚Äì Sean D. Tucker ‚Äì 1-800-COLLECT Tucker's biplane regularly appeared at military and civilian airshows throughout North America for several years, later transitioning to the 10-10-220 brand under MCI until the program ended in 2000. The service's heavy spend on television advertising made 1-800-COLLECT ads, which featured celebrities including Phil Hartman and Arsenio Hall, a ubiquitous feature of the 1990s TV landscape in the United States. As of 2000, 1-800-COLLECT was being promoted with more than $160 million in annual advertising support by MCI. ReferencesExternal links *Official website.

Pantolambda lived during the middle Paleocene, and has been found both in Asia and North America. Cretaceous mammals, which had to compete with dinosaurs, were generally small insect eaters. Pantolambda was one of the first mammals to expand into the large-animal niches left vacant by the extinction of the dinosaurs. Pantolambda and other early pantodonts would quickly evolve into heavy animals such as Barylambda and Coryphodon. These were the first large browsers, pioneering styles of life later followed by many unrelated groups of mammals: rhinos, tapirs, hippos, ground sloths, and elephants.Halstead, L.B., The Evolution of the Mammals, Peter Lowe, 1978. Pantodonts such as Pantolambda were definitely not tree dwellers. Description P. bathmodon fore and hind foot casts at the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin Pantolambda was large for a Paleocene mammal, about the size of a sheep. A generalized early mammal, it had a vaguely cat-like body, heavy head, long tail and five-toed plantigrade feet ending in blunt nails that were neither hooves nor sharp claws. The foot bones articulated in a similar way to the feet of hoofed mammals, and the feet were probably not very flexible. Teeth The teeth had a selenodont structure; enamel ridges with crescent-shaped cusps. Selenodont teeth are found in modern grazers and browsers such as cattle and deer, but Pantolambda's teeth were low-crowned and indicate a not very specialized diet. Pantolambda probably ate a mix of shoots, leaves, fungi, and fruit, which it may have supplemented with occasional worms or eggs. Discovery and species P. bathmodon by Robert Bruce Horsfall.

In V√∂lusp√† 10, he is identified as m√¶ztr um or√∞inn dverga allra, \\"lord of all the dwarves\\".Jackson Crawford translation, The Poetic Edda, 2015, p. 4. According to Snorri Sturluson in Gylfaginning 14, which seeks to explain this verse, \\"the dwarfs had taken shape first and acquired life in the flesh of Ymir and were then maggots, but by decision of the gods they became conscious with intelligence and had the shape of men though they live in the earth and in rocks. Modsognir was a dwarf and the second was Durinn.\\"Anthony Faulkes translation, 1988. Edda, Everyman edition, 1987, reprinted 1997. Origin According to V√∂lusp√† 9, the dwarfs were created by ginnheil√∂g go√∞, \\"the high holy gods\\", who resolved to fashion them \\"out of Brimir's blood and Blainn's bones,\\" a phrase typically interpreted to mean the blood and flesh of the primordial giant, Ymir.ibid, Nordal, p. 26. This is based on the mythic fact that Ymir was slain and his corpse was used to fashion the earth and heaven, as told in Grimn√≠sm√°l 40-41 from the Poetic Edda and Snorri's account in Gylfaginning 8. In scholarship, the interpretation of V√∂lusp√† 9-10 in Snorri's Prose Edda, (Gylfaginning 14), is disputed, primarily because his text of the verse varies from that found in independent manuscripts of the poem. The original text in the Codex Regius and Hauksb√≥k manuscripts, appear to refer to how the dwarfs together gave shape to human beings (manl√≠kon), which are then brought to life by Odin and his brothers in the verses following the so-called Dvergatal (V√∂lusp√° v. 9-16), which is commonly seen as an interpolation into the text.Ursula Dronke, Poetic Edda, Volume II, 1997, p. 67; Gro Steinsland, \\"Antropogonimyten i V√∂lusp√°\\" in Arkiv f√∂r Nordisk Filologi, 1983; Tryggvi G√≠slason, \\"Hverr skyldi dverga dr√≥ttir skepja\\" in Festskrift til Ludvig Holm- Olsen, 1984. Sigurd Nordal observed that \\"Sophus Bugge read the second half of verse 10 as \\"these dwarfs made many manikins in the earth, as Durinn said\\", noting \\"this appears to assume Modsognir and Durin shape the dwarfs, but only as manikins (i.e. dead images of men) and that the ¬≠√Üsir then gave them life.\\" Nordal concludes that \\"Snorri's narrative is similar, but it was probably only his interpretation of the stanza as he knew it (cf. textual variants)\\". Ursula Dronke summarizes this view, stating \\"Snorri omits, therefore 10/1-4, which tells of the creating of the dwarfs by the two master dwarfs, and alters the lines 'they created many man-shaped figures out of the earth' to 'many man- shaped figures formed themselves out of the earth.' When 9/5 is cited in Snorri's Edda, it too has to be changed. The gods must not consider 'who' (hverr) should create the dwarfs, as this does not fit their maggot-like origins. Instead, ...they simply consider 'that' (at in place of hverr) the dwarfs should be created.\\"ibid. Dronke, 1997, p. 67. Additional scholarly etymologies of the name M√≥dsognir suggest a derivation from ON m√≥√∞r and s√∫ga, perhaps related to Swedish modsugen, \\"apathetic\\", rendering the meaning \\"the tried sigher\\"; \\"moth sucker\\" has also been suggested, however unlikely this may seem.Rudolf Simek, Dictionary of Northern Mythology, 1984, p. 221 Lotte Motz offered the reading \\"furious sucker\\".Lotte Motz, \\"New Thoughts on Dwarf- Names\\", Fr√ºhmittelalterliche Studien 7, 1973.

Despite being considered a dialect word, and somewhat archaic, writers have periodically turned to it. In addition to its appearance in fiction, in the 19th century it was used in official reports as a general term for susceptibility to cold.

Description  Restoration of B. faberi In life, Barylambda probably resembled a large ground sloth, with a small head and long, well-developed tail and bear-like legs. The length was about 2.5 meters with a weight around 650 kg, about the size of a pony. Barylambda was large even for a pantodont, sheer size probably protecting it from contemporary carnivores. Like other pantodonts, Barylambda was a heavyset, five-toed plantigrade animal. The vertebrae of the tail were unusually massive; the living animal may have been able to rear up and support itself on the hind legs and tail in order to reach higher for food. The generalized appearance of the teeth, the presence of well-developed canines only in males, the grinding wear and lack of shearing blades on the molars, and the animal's heavy build strongly suggest that it was herbivorous.

Early life Lurie was born to a Jewish familyJWeekly: \\"Jewish stars of the Giants, Rangers World Series\\" by Andy Altman-Ohrin October 28, 2010 in San Francisco, the son of Babette (n√©e Greenbaum) and Louis Lurie. In 1972, he took over the real estate company founded in 1922 by his father whose name is synonymous with San Francisco real estate development during the middle part of the 20th century. The company built a number of properties along Montgomery Street over the years, including a building Bank of America bought and tore down for its world headquarters at 555 California St., and it still owns many of them. Other notable local properties owned by Lurie are the Mark Hopkins Hotel and the Curran Theatre. Lurie's real estate company has also upgraded some older properties in San Francisco. For example, Lurie invested $20 million in 901 Market St. and brought in retailers Copeland's Sports and Marshalls, transforming the mid- Market Street eyesore into a winner. Giants Ownership In 1975, Giants owner Horace Stoneham agreed in principle to sell the team to a group headed by the Labatt Brewing Company, which intended to move the team to Toronto. Mayor George Moscone won an injunction to stop the sale, and then persuaded Lurie, a Giants minority owner and board member, to put together a group that would buy the team and keep it in San Francisco. In February 1976, Lurie announced he was putting together a bid to buy the Giants for $8 million. His original investment partner was Bob Short, but a disagreement over who was to be the primary investor resulted in the latter being replaced by Phoenix, Arizona-based meat-packer Bud Herseth by the time the transaction was unanimously approved by the other National League club owners on March 2, 1976.\\"Giants Purchased By Lurie, Herseth,\\" The Associated Press, Wednesday, March 3, 1976. Retrieved February 29, 2020 Lurie became the Giants' sole owner when he bought out Herseth three years later in early spring of 1979.Garratt, Rob. \\"San Francisco Giants team ownership history,\\" Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), Wednesday, September 5, 2018. Retrieved February 29, 2020 Although Toronto was awarded its own expansion team, the Blue Jays, in 1977, it would not be the last time that San Francisco's baseball fans would fear the possibility of losing their team. The 1970s was a generally disappointing decade for the Giants and the trend continued throughout Lurie‚Äôs ownership. In 1985, a year which saw the Giants lose 100 games (the most in franchise history), Lurie responded by hiring Al Rosen as general manager. Under Rosen's tenure, the Giants promoted promising rookies such as Will Clark and Robby Thompson, and made canny trades to acquire such players as Kevin Mitchell, Dave Dravecky, Candy Maldonado, and Rick Reuschel. The Giants would not have a better influx of young position players since that period until the mid-2000s. Meanwhile, in both 1987 and 1989, San Francisco voters rejected two stadium referenda to replace the notoriously unaccommodating Candlestick Park as the home of the Giants, despite the franchise's offer to pick up most of the tab for a new downtown park. Worse still, a plan to improve the existing stadium failed by an even wider margin. Frustrated, Lurie looked south toward Silicon Valley, only to see San Jose and Santa Clara voters reject three more proposals to build a Giants ballpark. Finally, in October 1992, Lurie announced that he would sell the Giants, claiming that he could no longer sustain the financial losses (averaging about $2‚Äì7 million annually) that had accumulated over the last few years. During his announcement, Lurie appeared visibly emotional, his voice breaking as he explained his hopes for turning the business side around when he bought the team in 1976. Nonetheless, losing teams and poor weather conditions at Candlestick Park kept many fans away, and at the time of Lurie's announcement, the team had finished with a 72-90 record. Originally, Lurie had agreed to sell the Giants for $115 million to an ownership group headed by Vince Naimoli (original owner of the Tampa Bay Rays) with plans to move the club to St. Petersburg, Florida. However, the National League nixed the deal, pressuring Lurie to sell the club to Bay Area investors. In an 11th hour effort to save the team from moving, a group of local investors headed by ex-Safeway magnate, Peter Magowan, offered Lurie $100 million for the Giants. Post-Giants Ownership Since selling the Giants, Lurie has focused his efforts on his real estate firm, the Lurie Co., buying and selling properties and branching out beyond its core office holdings totalling over , not including two hotels, a theater and a parking facility it owns. He is also involved in various philanthropic activities, which include the $20 million Louis R. Lurie Foundation. Lurie is an adviser of the Alternative Golf Association (known as \\"Flogton\\").

Some recipes of Sandesh call for the use of chhena or paneer (which is made by curdling the milk and separating the whey from it) instead of milk itself. Some people in the region of Dhaka call it pranahara (literally, heart 'stealer') which is a softer kind of sandesh, made with mawa and the essence of curd. History Sandesh from Bengal A sweet dish by the name sandesh is mentioned in medieval Bengali literature, including Krittibas' Ramayana and lyrics of Chaitanya. However, the ingredients of this original dish are not known. This dish was most likely different from the modern chhena-based sandesh, being made of solidified kheer. It is hard to determine when exactly sandesh started referring mainly to the chhena-based sweet instead of the kheer-based sweet. But it is known that by the second half of the 19th century, sandesh commonly referred to the chhena-based sweet. The Portuguese influence may have led to introduction of cheese (i.e. chhena) in sixteenth century. Preparation A typical Bengali sandesh Sandesh can be made with the use of chhena or cottage cheese. The simplest kind of sandesh in Bengal is the makha sandesh (makha = kneaded). It is prepared by tossing the chhena lightly with sugar over low heat. The sandesh is essentially hot, sweetened chhana. When shaped into balls, it is called Kanchagolla (kancha = raw; golla = ball). For more complex and elaborately prepared sandesh, the chhana is dried and pressed, flavored with essence of fruits, and sometimes even colored, and cooked to many different levels of consistencies. Sometimes it is filled with syrup, blended with coconut or kheer, and molded into a variety of shapes such as conch shells, elephants, and fish. Another variant is nolen gurer sandesh, which is made with gur or jaggery. It is known for its brown or caramel colour that comes from nolen gur.

It lived during the Capitanian epoch of the Guadalupian (266‚Äì260 million years ago) in what is now South Africa. Like the well-known Moschops, they were dinocephalians, a clade of large-bodied therapsids that flourished from 270 to 260 million years ago and then went extinct without descendants. Paleontologists surmise that Anteosaurus hunted rather like crocodiles, pulling land animals into the water. In particular, scientists point to the animal's strong tail and weak, sprawling legs. Its body was well- suited to projecting itself forward, both in hunting and evidently in head- butting.  Description  A. magnificus restoration Anteosaurus had a tall, narrow skull, which is long. It was perhaps the largest known carnivorous non- mammalian synapsid, estimated at in length and in weight. The teeth are another identifying characteristic of Anteosaurus. The teeth on the roof of the mouth are enlarged and confined in a cluster near the outer tooth row. The \\"normal teeth\\" include the anterior, canine and cheek teeth. A prominent feature of the dinocephalians is the ledge on the anterior teeth. The canine teeth are big, and there are usually about ten cheek teeth present. The front of the mouth curves up due to the premaxillary bone of the upper jaw.  Classification = Species  Genus synonymy = As defined by Lieuwe Dirk Boonstra, Anteosaurus is ‚Äúa genus of anteosaurids in which the postfrontal forms a boss of variable size overhanging the dorso-posterior border of the orbit.‚Äù On this basis he synonymised six of the seven genera named from the Tapinocephalus zone: Eccasaurus, Anteosaurus, Titanognathus, Dinosuchus, Micranteosaurus, and Pseudanteosaurus. Of these, he says, Dinosuchus and Titanognathus can safely be considered synonyms of Anteosaurus. Eccasaurus, with a holotype of which the cranial material consists of only few typical anteosaurid incisors, appears to be only determinable as to family. The skull fragment forming the holotype of Pseudanteosaurus can best be considered as an immature specimen of Anteosaurus. Micranteosaurus, the holotype of which contains a small snout, was previously considered a new genus on account of its small size but is better be interpreted as a young specimen of Anteosaurus. And likewise, the large number of species attributed to the genus Anteosaurus can also be considered synonyms. Boonstra still considers as valid the genus Paranteosaurus, which is defined as a genus of anteosaurids in which the postfrontal is not developed to form a boss. This is probably an example of individual variation and hence another synonym of Anteosaurus. = Species synonymy = Anteosaurus was once known by a large number of species, but the current thinking on this is that they merely represent different growth stages of the same type species, A. magnificus.  Phylogeny  Below is a cladogram from a 2012 phylogenetic study of anteosaurians:  Paleobiology  During the Permian, two clades of amniotes came to dominate terrestrial niches: the sauropsids and the synapsids. The synapsids included top predators, such as Dimetrodon and Gorgonopsia. Anteosaurus were therapsids, a clade within Synapsida that includes the Permian ancestors of mammals.  Ecology  Reconstruction of Anteosaurus showing the animal in a crocodile-like posture Olson notes that the Russian dinocephalian assemblages indicate environments tied to water, and Boonstra considered that the roughly contemporary Anteosaurus were slinking crocodile- like semi-aquatic forms. The long tail, weak limbs, and sprawling posture do indeed suggest some sort of crocodile-like existence. However the thickened skull-roof indicates that these animals were quite able to get about on land, if they were to practice the typically dinocephalian head-butting behaviour. All other head-butters (pachycephalosaurians, titanotheres, and goats) were or are completely terrestrial. Perhaps these animals spent some time in the water but were active on land during the mating season, and probably quite able to get about on land to hunt for prey.  Head-butting behavior  Anteosaurus like other related therapsids had a thickened skull (pachyostosis), and this has been suggested as an adaptation for head butting, or perhaps more aptly for head pushing. Also like with Moschops, the overall build seems to have been for projecting its body weight forwards. Not only could this have been useful in dominance head pushing contests, but it may have also been a technique to knock over unsuspecting or weakened prey.

Discontinuous deformation analysis: A new numerical model for the statics and dynamics of block systems. University of California, Berkeley. 1988 in 1988. DDA is somewhat similar to the finite element method for solving stress-displacement problems, but accounts for the interaction of independent particles (blocks) along discontinuities in fractured and jointed rock masses. DDA is typically formulated as a work- energy method, and can be derived using the principle of minimum potential energy or by using Hamilton's principle. Once the equations of motion are discretized, a step-wise linear time marching scheme in the Newmark family is used for the solution of the equations of motion. The relation between adjacent blocks is governed by equations of contact interpenetration and accounts for friction. DDA adopts a stepwise approach to solve for the large displacements that accompany discontinuous movements between blocks. The blocks are said to be \\"simply deformable\\". Since the method accounts for the inertial forces of the blocks' mass, it can be used to solve the full dynamic problem of block motion.  Vs DEM  Although DDA and DEM are similar in the sense that they both simulate the behavior of interacting discrete bodies, they are quite different theoretically. While DDA is a displacement method, DEM is a force method. While DDA uses displacement as variables in an implicit formulation with opening-closing iterations within each time step to achieve equilibrium of the blocks under constrains of the contact, DEM employs an explicit, time marching scheme to solve the equations of motion directly (Cundall and HartCundall, P. A., and R. D. Hart. ‚ÄúNumerical Modelling of Discontinua,‚Äù in Proceedings of the 1st U.S. Conference on Discrete Element Methods (Golden, Colorado, October 1989), pp. 1-17. G.G.W. Mustoe, M. Henriksen and H-P. Huttelmaier, Eds. Golden, Colorado: CSM Press, 1989.). The system of equation in DDA is derived from minimizing the total potential energy of the system being analyzed. This guarantee that equilibrium is satisfied at all times and that energy consumption is natural since it is due to frictional forces. In DEM, unbalanced forces drive the solution process, and damping is used to dissipate energy. If a quasi-static solution is desired in which the intermediate steps are not of interest, the type of damping and the type of relaxation scheme can be selected in DEM to obtain the most efficient solution method (CundallCundall, P. A. ‚ÄúDistinct Element Models of Rock and Soil Structure,‚Äù in Analytical and Computational Methods in Engineering Rock Mechanics, Ch. 4, pp. 129-163. E. T. Brown, Ed. London: George Allen & Unwin, 1987.). The application of damping in DEM for quasi- static problem is somewhat analogues to the setting to zero of the initial velocities of the block in the static analysis of DDA. In dynamic problem, however, the amount and type of damping in DEM, which are very difficult to qualify experimentally, has to be selected very carefully to as not to damp out real vibrations. On the other hand, the energy consumption in DDA is due to the frictional resistance at contact. By passing the velocities of the blocks at the end of a time step to the next time step, DDA gives real dynamic solution with correct energy consumption. By using an energy approach, DDA does not require an artificial damping term to dissipate energy as in DEM, and can easily incorporate other mechanisms for energy loss.  Strengths and limitations  DDA has several strengths recommending it for use in slope stability problems in jointed rock masses, which are balanced by serious limitations be accounted when DDA is used for larger scale, faster moving problems.  Strengths  * Very good for problems with small characteristic as time marching scheme provides necessary numerical damping to control resonance interactions within and between particles. * Step-wise linear implicit time marching allows so-called quasi-static solutions, where step- wise velocities are never used. Quasi-static analysis is useful for examining slow, or creeping failures.  Limitations  * The most serious limitation of the DDA method is the reduction of numerical damping which occurs as the characteristic length of a problem grows. The numerically, damping is a function of \\\\sqrt{k/M}. Typically, the stiffness k doesn't vary over 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, while the mass M is a function of the cube of the characteristic length.  Modification and improvement  Various modifications to the original DDA formulation have been reported in the rock mechanics literature. In the original DDA formulation a first order polynomial displacement function was assumed, so the stresses and strains within a block in the model were constant. This approximation precludes the application of this algorithm to problems with significant stress variations within the block. However, in cases where the displacement inside the block is high and cannot be ignored, the blocks can be divided by mesh. An example of this approach is the research by Chang et al.CHANG, C. T., MONTEIRO, P., NEMATI, K., & SHYU, K. (1996). Behavior of marble under compression. Journal of materials in civil engineering, 8(3), 157-170. and JingJing L. Formulation of discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA)‚Äîan implicit discrete element model for block systems. Int J Eng Geol 1998;49:371‚Äì81. who resolved this problem by adding finite element meshes in the two-dimensional domain of the blocks so that stress variations within the blocks can be allowed.

It runs between the village of Amityville in the town of Babylon and Halesite in the town of Huntington. NY 110 comes close to the Nassau County line several times in the town of Babylon, which is only surpassed by NY 108 in distance to the county line for a state highway. Route description NY 110 begins at an intersection with NY 27A (Merrick Road) in the Suffolk County village of Amityville. Proceeding northward as Broadway, NY 110 crosses through downtown Amityville as a two- lane village street. Expanding to four lanes, the route intersects at-grade with County Route 12 (CR 12; Oak Street) before crossing under the Babylon Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, a block east of Amityville station. NY 110 continues north along Broadway, forking northwest at a junction with Albany Avenue. Passing Brunswick Hospital, the route intersects with the western terminus of CR 2 (Dixon Street) before entering a cloverleaf interchange with NY 27 (Sunrise Highway). NY 110 continues into North Amityville, becoming a four-lane boulevard through the center of the hamlet. The route crosses through several commercial districts in North Amityville, proceeding northwest towards the Nassau County line. Bending northward alongside the county line, NY 110 enters an interchange with the Southern State Parkway (exit 32S-N), where the route changes names to Broad Hollow Road. NY 110 then expands to six lanes, intersecting with CR 47 (Main Street / Great Neck Road). Bending northeast and away from the county line, NY 110 continues as a six-lane boulevard, crossing through the town of Babylon into East Farmingdale. NY 110 as seen from Old Country Road in Melville. The Northern State Parkway is visible crossing over NY 110 in the distance Entering East Farmingdale, NY 110 crosses over the Central Branch of the Long Island Rail Road and enters a large grade-separated interchange with NY 109 (Farmingdale Road) just west of Republic Airport. NY 110 continues north through Babylon as a six-lane boulevard past the runway of Republic Airport, passing a small campus of Molloy College. Entering Airport Plaza, the route continues north into an intersection with the eastern terminus of the western segment of NY 24 (Conklin Street). NY 110 continues north along Broad Hollow Road, going underneath the Ronkonkoma Branch of the LIRR in between the Farmingdale and Pinelawn stops, then passing the campus of State University of New York at Farmingdale. Just north of the campus, the route leaves the town of Babylon, crossing into the town of Huntington. Now in Huntington, NY 110 crosses into East Melville, passing through several commercial strips, entering exit 49S-N of the Long Island Expressway (I-495), a cloverleaf interchange. After the Long Island Expressway, NY 110 reduces from six lanes to four, intersecting with CR 3 (Pinelawn Road). The route crosses several streets in at-grade junctions, crossing Old Country Road before changing names to Walt Whitman Road. After the name change, NY 110 crosses into a cloverleaf interchange with the Northern State Parkway (exit 40S-N). Continuing north along Walt Whitman Road, NY 110 proceeds north through a commercial strip in Melville. The route proceeds north as a four lane boulevard for several miles, crossing West Hills County Park and past Walt Whitman Shops. Just north of Walt Whitman Shops, NY 110 enters an at-grade intersection with NY 25 (West Jericho Turnpike) in the hamlet of South Huntington. the Huntington LIRR station. Pedestrian bridges crossing the roadway connect both of the station's parking lots North of NY 25, NY 110 shrinks to a two-lane road, crossing through South Huntington as Walt Whitman Road until the junction with New York Avenue, where that name terminates. NY 110 then proceeds northwest along New York Avenue, crossing through Huntington Station through a long commercial strip. Crossing through the village, NY 110 intersects with CR 11 (Pulaski Road). Passing the Huntington Public Library, NY 110 crosses under the Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island Railroad and the Huntington station. Expanding back to four lanes, the route continues through Huntington, bending northwest at Henry Street. NY 110 crosses northwest, passing a large shopping center. Reducing itself back to two lanes, NY 110 passes Huntington Rural Cemetery, crossing into Huntington Village. Now a two-lane commercial street, the route crosses past several blocks of businesses, intersecting with NY 25A (Main Street) before turning northeast out of the downtown section. Now in the Fort Hill section of Huntington, NY 110 proceeds northeast along New York Avenue, soon crossing back into Huntington Village. Passing Mill Dam Park, NY 110 intersects with the northern terminus of CR 35 (Mill Dam Road). Crossing through the Southdown section of Huntington, NY 110 bends northeast alongside Huntington Harbor, a part of Huntington Bay. Crossing into the hamlet of Halesite, NY 110 intersects with Youngs Hill Road, where the designation terminates. History The entirety of NY 110 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering. In May 1936, the Long Island Tercentenary Committee proposed a new name for the stretch of NY 110 in the area of the Walt Whitman Birthplace, whose preservation was also proposed in 1936 due to the lack of a \\"suitable\\" memorial to the famed poet on Long Island. On March 12, 1940, the town of Huntington approved the measure, renaming a stretch of Huntington- Amityville Road as Walt Whitman Road. In March 1953, work began on widening NY 110 between NY 25 (Jericho Turnpike) to the outskirts of Amityville. This new project, which was to cost $1 million (1953 USD), would expand the corridor to four lanes from two, as the road had already become the most heavily traveled section of routes in Suffolk County. In 1970, the alignment of NY 110 was proposed by the Nassau-Suffolk Regional Planning Board to be replace with a new expressway between NY 27 (Sunrise Highway) and NY 25\\\\. The new expressway was proposed to help work with traffic projected to increase along the corridor from 1970 to 1985. The new expressway would replace the two-four lane-wide NY 110 corridor with six lanes. Under the Long Island Transportation Plan, proposed in 2000, engineers suggested that NY 110 should be expanded to six lanes between the junction with NY 109 in Amityville to NY 27 along with a third lane between NY 27 and the Northern State Parkway. One of the engineers involved in the project stated that if NY 110 had more office building development, a light rail line would probably be constructed, but the engineer mentioned that the development was unlikely. On June 21, 2013, the New York State Department of Transportation announced that construction had begun on the stretch of NY 110 between the Long Island Expressway (I-495) and the Northern State Parkway. The construction would become a makeover to connect two previously completed reconstruction projects to help the roadway become ADA-accessible, upgrade the sewage systems, resurface the pavement along the alignment along with new traffic light systems and landscaping work. Construction of the new $22.5 million project would be completed by the end of 2014. NY 110's interchange with the Northern State was completed on November 13, 2013. The project, which cost $60 million, included demolishing the old Northern State bridge, expanding NY 110 to three travel lanes and building a new bridge that was designed with parts of the old bridge to keep Robert Moses's styles intact. Former segments In Melville and South Huntington, two former segments of NY 110, both named Old Walt Whitman Road, run parallel to the route along the west side of the road. The northern segment in South Huntington is home to the Walt Whitman Birthplace. Note Walt Whitman's Birthplace on the right side of NY 110, instead of the left, where it is today. In between, a third former segment exists as Amityville Road, located north of the Northern State Parkway. The Melville section of Walt Whitman Road goes from what is now Duryea Road to a dead end between Old Country Road and the Northern State Parkway. The realigned segment is on the former right-of- way for the Huntington Railroad Trolley line. The South Huntington section runs between Overhill Road and Livingston Street.

Quenstedt was born at Quedlinburg, a nephew of Johann Gerhard. He was educated at the University of Helmstedt, 1637‚Äì43, and at the University of Wittenberg, 1644, where afterwards he lectured on geography; was adjunct professor in the philosophical faculty, 1646‚Äì49; ordinary professor of logic and metaphysics and associate professor of theology, 1649‚Äì60; and ordinary professor of theology, 1660‚Äì88 until his death. Quenstedt represents the old orthodox reaction after the period of reconstruction had set in. The fruit of his thirty years of work in the university lectureship was published in the Theologia didactico-polemica sive systema theologicum (Wittenberg, 1685; Leipzig, 1715), a work according to the strictest standard of Lutheran orthodoxy, based upon the Theologia, positiva acroamatica of his teacher, Johann Friedrich K√∂nig, and characterized by external dogmatization instead of a development of the subject from within, and abounding in artful scholastic refinements. Quenstedt was noted among his contemporaries for his mild, irenic spirit and retiring, pious disposition, which is also shown by his Ethica pastorum et instructio cathedralis (1678), in which he advises to temper severity with gentleness in resisting heretics, and to distinguish between the tempters and the tempted; warns against pedantry in the pulpit; and recommends the reading of Johann Arndt's Vom wahren Christenthum. His other works include the Dialogus de patriis illustrium doctrina et scriptis virorum (Wittenberg, 1654), and a collection of dissertations, Exercitationes de theologia in genere ejusque principio sancta scriptura (1677).

Distelmans's father was a shoemaker who dreamed of training his children to be musicians. Distelmans's mother died while giving birth to her sixth child, and the children's father raised them to play in a string quartet. As a young man, Napoleon won the prestigious Prix de Rome viola, which awarded him a scholarship to study with one of the leading viola players of this era in London. The language of study at the Antwerp Conservatory had just been changed from French to Dutch at the instigation of Flemish nationalist composer Peter Benoit when the Distelmans brothers enrolled there. The school remained a breeding ground for Flemish nationalism long afterwards. The cello-playing brother of the quartet particularly became a fierce nationalist, which contributed to the dissolution of the quartet during World War II. Napoleon also was the viola soloist for some time in the Orchestra of the Antwerp Zoological Society. The concerts of the Society were known to attract, at times, Gustav Mahler, Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Rachmaninoff to conduct their own works there in the hall next to Central Railway Station. 1884 births 1946 deaths Belgian classical violists People from Berchem ","title":"Napoleon Distelmans"},{"id":"6373660","text":"Frank William Gustine (February 20, 1920 ‚Äì April 1, 1991) was an American Major League Baseball player who appeared in three All-Star Games during his 12-season (1939‚Äì50) MLB career.

It is about a man who finds a baby chimpanzee in a giant King Kong prop and decides to raise it like a son. It was filmed in English and shot in Long Island, New York. As this was a French-Italian co-production, French and Italian dubbed versions were made for their respective countries' theatrical releases. Plot The film is set in a dark surreal New York that is mostly devoid of humans and populated only by rats and a few eccentrics. Lafayette is a young French electrician living on his own in a basement who works for Andreas Flaxman, the cynical owner of a waxwork museum dedicated to recreating scenes from imperial Rome. He works alongside his friend the sculptor Luigi Nocello, who the maintains the varied and often macabre wax displays, such as the Crucifixion of Jesus and the Assassination of Julius Caesar, which fill the museum. Lafayette also works as a lighting technician for a feminist theatre group. After rehearsal one day, the women in the group discuss their next project and decide to improvise a piece about rape for their next production, contending that women are just as capable of violence as men are; in the middle of their discussion, they knock Lafayette unconscious with a bottle of Coca-Cola, pin him down, and the attractive Angelica volunteers to rape Lafayette. Beside the Hudson River, amidst construction site of Battery Park City, Lafayette meets Luigi and a band of eccentrics who find an abandoned baby chimpanzee in the palm of a giant King Kong Sculpture that Lafayette adopts. When he brings the chimp with him to the museum, Flaxman warns him that the chimp will rob him his freedom if he does not get rid of it. Flaxman is approached by the mysterious Paul Jefferson of the State Foundation for Psychological Research who convinces the initially resistant Flaxman to transform the face of the sculpture Julius Caesar into the face of John F. Kennedy. Angelica, who has become enamored with Lafayette, moves into his sordid flat and shares in the care of the infant chimp. However, when Lafayette does not respond to the news that she is pregnant, she moves out. Alone again, he returns one day to find his baby ape eaten by rats. In total despair and needing human contact, he breaks into the waxwork museum but is met with hostility by the owner. The two fight and a fire, presumably caused by faulty wiring, consumes them both. Later, we see Angelica on the shore playing happily with her child.

Early life Yitzhak Frenkel was born in 1899 in Odessa, Russian Empire. He was a great-grandson of the famous Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev. In 1917, he studied under Aleksandra Ekster at the Fine Arts Academy in Odessa. Frenkel immigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1919 as part of the first wave of settlers of the Third Aliyah. He died in Tel Aviv in 1981 and was buried in Safed. Art Of Frenkel Frenel in the 1920s and 1930s 193x193px In 1920, he established the artists' cooperative in Jaffa and an artists' studio in Gymnasia Herzliya where gave lessons in painting and sculpture. Later that year, he traveled to Paris where he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®reAlexandre Frenel (Isaac Frenkel aka) - Odessa - 1899 - Tel Aviv - 1981 at the studios of the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle and painter Henri Matisse. At the time his painting were abstract. Towards the end of 1920, Frenkel Frenel traveled to Egypt where he showcased his works in an exhibition before returning to Paris. Frenkel returned to Palestine in 1925 and opened the Histadrut Art School in Tel Aviv. In Israel he was considered extreme in his artistic orientations. His students included Shimshon Holzman, Mordechai Levanon, David Hendler, Joseph Kossonogi, and Siona Tagger. He was a mentor to Bezalel students Avigdor Stematsky, Yehezkel Streichman, Moshe Castel, and Arie Aroch. All those who studied under him absorbed French influence and most them would go to learn in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s. Frenkel's style was closer to the abstract painting to which he was exposed in Paris than the orientalism that was popular in Palestine at that time. In 1926, he presented in the \\"Ohel\\" theater his abstract work, compositions of geometric shapes and alongside them landscape paintings. In this period an expressionistic tendency in his work begins to arise, especially in his choice of colour. By the time he returned to Paris in 1929 his expressionist style came into form. In 1934 he made Safed his home, becoming the first artist to settle in the ancient holy city, 14 years before the \\"Artists' Colony\\" was formally established. There he painted the ancient synagogues, narrow lanes, local inhabitants and surrounding countryside.A house in Safed During that period he completely abandons the abstract style and embarks in the search of other, vibrant styles. In that same he year he designed the \\"Adloyada\\" carnival in Tel Aviv. In 1936 he began designing sets and costumes for the \\"HaOhel\\" theater. He will continue engaging in the sort of work until 1949, continuing his work both for the \\"HaOhel\\" theater as well as the \\"HaBima\\" theater. During that same period he also painted portraits of several famous actors who worked for the said theaters. In 1937 he embarked on a journey, painting Israel from point to point, North to South. He painted Safed, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the Negev desert as well as the Galilee. He made 13 exhibitions on the motif of Safed up-to 1950.  Art in the 1940s and onwards: historical artist and international success  In the year 1948, the year of Israel's independence, he will be allowed to record historic milestones in the Israel's story. Painting the first meeting of the Knesset as well as the first meeting of the military committee of the IDF. He also made portraits of the first 120 MKs (Members of the Knesset). In 1949, he would become one of the founders of the \\"Artists Colony of Safed\\". In 1950 he exhibited his work in the first and second Bienniale of Venice, representing Israel. In 1952 he exhibited again in Paris. In France he created vitrages (Window glass work), which were ordered by the Baroness Alix de Rothshild at Normandy in the north of France. He is considered one of the most important Jewish \\"√âcole de Paris\\" painters; along with Soutine, Mogdiliani, Kikone, Kremegne, Manne Katz and Paskin. He presents his work in one-man shows all over the world. By 1960 he had presented his works in one-man shows in museums and galleries stretching the globe from Europe and the Americas to South Africa and Asia. From 1960 he lives in Paris and uses Tzfat/Safed as his summer home. In 1973, his house reopened as a museum showcasing his work. In July 1978, Frenkel had a one-man show at the Orangerie in Paris. Expressionist works of Frenkel pinpoint the expression of inner experience rather than solely realistic portrayal, seeking to depict not objective reality but the subjective emotions and responses that objects and events arouse in them. His exalts colours reveal his most hidden emotions and express passion and drama. When he paints his wife Ilana, the colours express an erotical explosion. In 1979 he had a One-man show at the famous \\"Orangerie\\" of Paris, in celebration of his 80th birthday. He died in 1981 in Tel Aviv and was buried in Safed.

It is situated below the Principal's bungalow at Trinity College, Kandy. The chapel is one of the first and finest examples of the application of indigenous architecture in the design of an Anglican church in the country. The building is modelled on traditional Buddhist architecture, reminiscent of those found in Polonnaruwa, an ancient capital of Sri Lanka, in that it is an open building with a lofty hipped roof supported by numerous carved stone pillars. History In 1918 the school principal of Trinity College, Rev. Alexander Garden Fraser (1873-1962) commenced planning for the construction of a chapel, identifying a site within the school grounds. Rev. Fraser was the principal of Trinity College between 1904 and 1924. He played a pivotal role in the development of Trinity College from a small provincial school to a national college. The vice principal, Rev. Lewis John Gaster (1879-1939), who joined the school in 1910, a qualified architect and draughtsman, prepared the plans for the chapel. Gaster went on to become the principal at King's College in Uganda. The foundation stone was laid by Foss Westcott, the Metropolitan of India, Burma and Ceylon on 19 August 1922, as part of the school's fiftieth anniversary celebrations. The original foundation stone of the chapel, was laid in front of the main hall, where the car park now stands and was later moved to the outside wall of the chapel, where it can still be seen today. The construction of the chapel, which commenced in early 1923 and took over twelve years to complete, was overseen by staff members, Mr. K.L.B. Tennekoon and Mr. H.W. Mediwake. During construction nearly a 100 craftsman and laborers were employed. In 1929 the side chapel was the first section to be completed. David Paynter, OBE (1900-1975), a staff member of the college painted the first mural on the southern wall of the side chapel in 1928. In 1930 the side chapel was dedicated as the \\"Chapel of the Light of the World\\". Following the completion of the side chapel the main chapel and the sanctuary were constructed. These works were completed in 1933 upon which Paynter painted a further mural above the main altar. The Chapel was formally dedicated on 3 March 1935. In 1954 the original corrugated zinc roof sheets were replaced with calicut tiles, during the course of the re-roofing the murals above the pulpit and lectern are badly damaged. Paynter subsequently repainted these murals, completing the work in 1957. Architecture The interior of Trinity College Chapel, Kandy At the time when most Europeans were content to build churches in their own Gothic style, Gaster deliberately sought inspiration from the local Sinhalese architecture. Prototypes for the Church are to be found at the Royal Audience Hall, Magul Maduwa (Celebration Hall), of the Kingdom of Kandy (built in 1783 by Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha) and the 14th century Embekka Devalaya Shrine near Kandy. The first example of the use of traditional architectural design in Christian churches, also involved both Rev. Fraser and Rev. Gaster was the chapel at the Peradeniya Training Colony, however similar to the Magul Maduwa and the Embekka Shrine the pillars of this chapel are made of wood. Pillars The creation of the stone pillars were supervised by K. L. Siripala, a famous stonemason of the time, to be shaped and carved. Other stone carvers were also brought to Sri Lanka especially for the purpose of carving the pillars for the chapel. The carvings on the windows of the side of the chapel were done by local craftsmen. The fifty four pillars are made of granite quarried in Aruppola, away. Some, in the chancel, are built in sections, but most have been hewn out of single blocks ( long and square), each of which weighing about before carving. The blocks were then hauled up to the college on a trolley by a pair of elephants. The first pillars to be erected, those by the pulpit and the south entrance, were fully carved at the quarry before being transported. The remainder were carved at the site of the chapel. Each pillar is in height and square, they are square based and square capped, with a gently tapering stem, octagonal in shape. The capitals on ten of the pillars facing the nave are carved with the coats of arms of those British schools and colleges, which made financial donations towards the cost of the chapel. Four of the pillars at the northern entrance carry carvings of the 'four beasts' of Revelation. The pillars are surmounted by four pekadas, made of a tough local wood called Gummalu. Each pekada, designed by Bezalel Navaratne, when viewed from below, has been carved to represent an inverted lotus. Many of the beams which the pillars support were also carved by local craftsman. Roof The roof of the chapel is in the style of a traditional Kandy-style double pitched roof. It starts at a height of and peaks at a height of above the central aisle. The chapel was originally roofed in corrugated zinc roof sheets but these were replaced in 1954 with calicut tiles. The Side Chapel The side chapel, entered from the north transept, was named by the then principal, Rev. McLeod Campbell as \\"the Chapel of the Light of the World\\". It was the first part of the chapel to be completed and was formally dedicated on 23 March 1930. The door and frame are typical Kandyan work. The whole of the south wall of this chapel is covered with an early painting by David Paynter depicting the Mother of James and John making a request to Jesus on behalf of her two sons. The chapel is rich in stone and wood carving. The screen and the grape and the chalice design on the altar were both made by local craftsman from the original drawings by Gaster. The windows are typical Kandyan, the vertical bars are made of wood and painted with lacquer. The grill on the east was carved locally from a slab of Swedish green marble, like the grills on the sanctuary of the main chapel. The Murals \\"The Crucifixion\\", by David Paynter (1933) The four murals were the work of the Sri Lankan artist David Paynter, once a member of the staff. Like the chapel itself, they were revolutionary when conceived, in that they portrayed biblical stories a Sri Lankan setting. * \\"Are Ye Able\\" located in the side chapel: This mural was painted in 1928, shortly after Paynter had returned from studying art in Europe. It conveys something of a lush vegetarian characteristic of parts of Sri Lanka which so impressed him on his return from Italy. In it, the mother of James and John kneels before Jesus of Nazareth, who is clothed in a yellow robe, and asks him to give her two sons, standing on either side of Jesus, the chief places in his kingdom. * \\"The Crucifixion\\" located above the altar: In this mural, painted in 1933, Paynter has set the crucifixion, with a beardless Christ on a cross, in a mangrove swamp, such as is to be found on the east coast of Sri Lanka. * \\"The Good Samaritan\\" located above the pulpit: The mural on the north side, painted in 1957, replaced an earlier one on the same subject. It depicts the parable of the Good Samaritan. * \\"Washing the Disciples Feet\\" located above the lectern: The mural, painted in 1965, replaced an earlier one on the same subject that was damaged when the roof of the chapel was replaced. Bell Tower Construction of the Bell Tower commenced in 1965, with the donation of ten slabs by Barney Raymond, an Old Boy. The Tower was dedicated on the 8 December 1969, in memory of Rev. Cannon John McLeod Campbell, by Rt. Rev. Lakdasa De Mel, the First Bishop of Kurunegala. The bell was received from a parish church in Hemsby in 1971. Services and Events Weekly devotions of students at Trinity College during school term, and Services on Sunday mornings are held at the Chapel. It is also well known for the musical events held there. Nine Lessons and Carols in Advent, and The Cross & Triumph of Christ in Lent by The Choir of Trinity College, Kandy and other events are held during the year.

More broadly speaking, the term includes anyone who was discriminated against, displaced or persecuted as a result of the policies and actions of the Nazis and their allies and, in addition to Jews who were uniquely targeted for complete annihilation, it includes those who were persecuted as a result of the Nazis' racial theories, such as the Romani people and Slavs, along with others who were seen as \\"undesirables\\" such as homosexuals, or for political reasons, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Communists. Survivors of the Holocaust include those persecuted civilians who were still alive when the concentration camps were liberated at the end of the war, or those who had either survived as partisans or been hidden with the assistance of non-Jews, or had escaped to territories beyond the control of the Nazis before the Final Solution was implemented. At the end of the war, the immediate issues which faced Holocaust survivors were physical and emotional recovery from the starvation, abuse and suffering which they had experienced; the need to search for their relatives and reunite with them if any of them were still alive; rebuild their lives by returning to their former homes, or more often, by immigrating to new and safer locations because their homes and communities had been destroyed or because they were endangered by renewed acts of antisemitic violence. After the initial and immediate needs of Holocaust survivors were addressed, additional issues came to the forefront. These included social welfare and psychological care, reparations and restitution for the persecution, slave labor and property losses which they had suffered, the restoration of looted books, works of art and other stolen property to their rightful owners, the collection of witness and survivor testimonies, the memorialization of murdered family members and destroyed communities, and care for disabled and aging survivors. Definition Mauthausen survivors cheer the soldiers of the Eleventh Armored Division of the United States Third Army a day after their liberation in May 1945. The term \\"Holocaust survivor\\" clearly applies to Jews who managed to live through the mass exterminations which were carried out by the Nazis. However, the term can also be applied to those who did not come under the direct control of the Nazi regime in Germany or occupied Europe, but were substantially affected by it, such as Jews who fled Germany or their homelands in order to escape the Nazis, and never lived in a Nazi-controlled country after Adolf Hitler came to power but lived in it before the Nazis put the \\"Final Solution\\" into effect, or others who were not persecuted by the Nazis themselves, but were persecuted by their allies or collaborators both in Nazi satellite countries and occupied countries. Yad Vashem, the State of Israel‚Äôs official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, defines Holocaust survivors as Jews who lived under Nazi control, whether it was direct or indirect, for any amount of time, and survived it. This definition includes Jews who spent the entire war living under Nazi collaborationist regimes, including France, Bulgaria and Romania, but were not deported, as well as Jews who fled or were forced to leave Germany in the 1930s. Additionally, other Jewish refugees are considered Holocaust survivors, including those who fled their home countries in Eastern Europe in order to evade the invading German army and spent years living in the Soviet Union. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gives a broader definition of Holocaust survivors: \\"The Museum honors any persons as survivors, Jewish or non-Jewish, who were displaced, persecuted, or discriminated against due to the racial, religious, ethnic, social, and political policies of the Nazis and their collaborators between 1933 and 1945. In addition to former inmates of concentration camps, ghettos, and prisons, this definition includes, among others, people who lived as refugees or people who lived in hiding.\\" In the later years of the twentieth century, as public awareness of the Holocaust evolved, other groups who had previously been overlooked or marginalized as survivors began to share their testimonies with memorial projects and seek restitution for their experiences. One such group consisted of Sinti (Gypsy) survivors of Nazi persecution who went on a hunger strike at Dachau, Germany, in 1980 in order to draw attention to their situation and demand moral rehabilitation for their suffering during the Holocaust, and West Germany formally recognized the genocide of the Roma in 1982. Another group that has been defined as Holocaust survivors consists of \\"flight survivors\\", that is, refugees who fled eastward into Soviet-controlled areas from the start of the war, or people were deported to various parts of the Soviet Union by the NKVD. The growing awareness of additional categories of survivors has prompted a broadening of the definition of Holocaust survivors by institutions such as the Claims Conference, Yad Vashem and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum so it can include flight survivors and others who were previously excluded from restitution and recognition, such as those who lived in hiding during the war, including children who were hidden in order to protect them from the Nazis. Numbers of survivors At the start of World War II in September 1939, about nine and a half million Jews lived in the European countries that were either already under the control of Nazi Germany or would be invaded or conquered during the war. Almost two thirds of these European Jews, nearly six million people, were annihilated, so that by the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, about 3.5 million of them had survived. Those who managed to stay alive until the end of the war, under varying circumstances, comprise the following: Concentration camps prisoners Between 250,000 and 300,000 Jews withstood the concentration camps and death marches, although tens of thousands of these survivors were too weak or sick to live more than a few days, weeks or months, notwithstanding the care that they received after liberation.  In hiding and partisans Throughout Europe, a few thousand Jews survived in hiding, or with false papers posing as non-Jews, hidden or assisted by non-Jews who risked their lives to rescue Jews individually or in small groups. Jews also survived by hiding in dense forests in Eastern Europe in particular, and Jewish partisans actively resisted the Nazis as well as protecting other escapees, and, in some instances, working with non-Jewish partisans groups to fight against the German invaders. In collaborationist regimes and occupied countries  Jews also survived in countries that were not under direct control of Nazi Germany but were ruled by pro-Nazis regimes, who at various points ceased to collaborate with the Nazi's extermination plans. In other places, Jews survived because the Germans did not manage to complete their deportation and annihilation before the end of the war: In Romania, after an initially ferocious anti-Jewish campaign and deportation and murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews, Romania's pro-Nazi government modified its anti-Jewish policies in anticipation of an Allied victory and about 60% of Romanian Jews were spared deportation to the death camps. In Bulgaria, almost three-quarters of the country's Jews survived, largely due to the resistance of Bulgarians to cooperating with the Nazis‚Äô policies. In the Italian occupation zones, because the Italian authorities refused to give up Jews despite intense pressure from the Germans, Croatian fascists, and the Vichy police, thousands of Jews survived in Dalmatia-Croatia, southern France and Greece. The Jewish community in Tunisia was also protected from annihilation by the Italian authorities, notwithstanding fascist Italy's antisemitic policies. Some Jews everywhere, but particularly in Belgium, France, Holland, Hungary and Italy, survived because the Germans and their collaborators did not manage to complete the deportations and mass-murder before Allied forces arrived. In Italy and France, about three quarters of the pre-war Jewish population survived, and in Belgium, about half survived, while in Holland, only about one in five of the pre-war Jewish population survived, and in Greece, Hungary, Slovakia and Yugoslavia, most of the Jews were murdered. In Hungary, for example, about one-third of the original Jewish population survived because liberation came before the Nazis could completely carry out their plans for the deportation and annihilation of the entire population. Refugees The largest group of survivors were the Jews who managed to escape from German-occupied Europe before or during the war. Among those who survived by fleeing the Nazis were the following: Nearly 300,000 Polish Jews fled to Soviet-occupied Poland and the interior of the Soviet Union between the start of the war in September 1939 and the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, more than a million Soviet Jews fled eastward into the interior. The Soviet authorities imprisoned many refugees and deportees in the Gulag system in the Urals, Soviet Central Asia or Siberia, where they endured forced labor, extreme conditions, hunger and disease. Nonetheless, most managed to survive, despite the harsh circumstances. Jews had begun emigrating from Germany in 1933 once the Nazis came to power, and from Austria from 1938, after the Anschluss. By the time war began in Europe, approximately 282,000 Jews had left Germany and 117,000 had left Austria. During the war, some Jews managed to escape to neutral European countries, such as Switzerland, which allowed in nearly 30,000, but turned away some 20,000 others; Spain, which permitted the entry of almost 30,000 Jewish refugees between 1939 and 1941, mostly from France, on their way to Portugal, but under German pressure allowed in fewer than 7,500 between 1942 and 1944; Portugal, which allowed thousands of Jews to enter so that they could continue their journeys from the port of Lisbon to the United States and South America; and Sweden, which allowed in some Norwegian Jews in 1940, and in October 1943, accepted almost the entire Danish Jewish community, rescued by the Danish resistance movement, which organized the escape of 7,000 Danish Jews and 700 of their non-Jewish relatives in small boats from Denmark to Sweden. About 18,000 Jews escaped by means of clandestine immigration to Palestine from central and eastern Europe between 1937 and 1944 on 62 voyages organized by the Mossad l'Aliyah Bet (Organization for Illegal Immigration), which was established by the Jewish leadership in Palestine in 1938. These voyages were conducted under dangerous conditions during the war, with hundreds of lives lost at sea. Immediate aftermath When the Second World War ended, the Jews who had survived the Nazi concentration camps, extermination camps, death marches as well as the Jews who had survived by hiding in forests or hiding with rescuers were almost all suffering from starvation, exhaustion and the abuse which they had endured, and tens of thousands of survivors continued to die from weakness, eating more than their emaciated bodies could handle, epidemic diseases, exhaustion and the shock of liberation. Some survivors returned to their countries of origin while others sought to leave Europe by immigrating to Palestine or other countries. Trauma of liberation  U.S. Army surgeon attends to a survivor in a sub-camp of Buchenwald concentration camp shortly after liberation A survivor, reduced by starvation to a living skeleton, after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen by the British For survivors, the end of the war did not bring an end to their suffering. Liberation itself was extremely difficult for many survivors and the transition to freedom from the terror, brutality and starvation they had just endured was frequently traumatic: As Allied forces fought their way across Europe and captured areas that had been occupied by the Germans, they discovered the Nazi concentration and extermination camps. In some places, the Nazis had tried to destroy all evidence of the camps to conceal the crimes that they had perpetrated there. In other places, the Allies found only empty buildings, as the Nazis had already moved the prisoners, often on Death Marches, to other locations. However, in many camps, the Allied soldiers found hundreds or even thousands of weak and starving survivors. Soviet forces reached Majdanek concentration camp in July 1944 and soon came across many other sites but often did not publicize what they had found; British and American units on the Western front did not reach the concentration camps in Germany until the spring of 1945. When Allied troops entered the concentration camps, they discovered thousands of Jewish and non- Jewish survivors suffering from starvation and disease, living in the most terrible conditions, many of them dying, along with piles of corpses, bones, and the human ashes of the victims of the Nazi mass murder. The liberators were unprepared for what they found but did their best to help the survivors. Despite this, thousands died in the first weeks after liberation. Many died from disease. Some died from refeeding syndrome since after prolonged starvation their stomachs and bodies could not take normal food. Survivors also had no possessions. At first, they still had to wear their concentration camp uniforms as they had no other clothes to wear. During the first weeks of liberation, survivors faced the challenges of eating suitable food, in appropriate amounts for their physical conditions; recuperating from illnesses, injuries and extreme fatigue and rebuilding their health; and regaining some sense of mental and social normality. Almost every survivor also had to deal with loss of many loved ones, many being the only one remaining alive from their entire family, as well as the loss of their homes, former activities or livelihoods, and ways of life. As survivors faced the daunting challenges of rebuilding their broken lives and finding any remaining family members, the vast majority also found that they needed to find new places to live. Returning to life as it had been before the Holocaust proved to be impossible. At first, following liberation, numerous survivors tried to return to their previous homes and communities, but Jewish communities had been ravaged or destroyed and no longer existed in much of Europe, and returning to their homes frequently proved to be dangerous. When people tried to return to their homes from camps or hiding places, they found that, in many cases, their homes had been looted or taken over by others. Most did not find any surviving relatives, encountered indifference from the local population almost everywhere, and, in eastern Europe in particular, were met with hostility and sometimes violence.  Sh'erit ha-Pletah  A group of orphaned survivors of the Holocaust, at the Atlit detainee camp, British Mandate for Palestine in 1944 Jewish survivors who could not or did not want to go back to their old homes, particularly those whose entire families had been murdered, whose homes, or neighborhoods or entire communities had been destroyed, or who faced renewed anti-Semitic violence, became known by the term \\"Sh'erit ha-Pletah\\" (). Most of the survivors comprising the group known as Sh'erit ha-Pletah originated in central and eastern European countries, while most of those from western European countries returned to them and rehabilitated their lives there. Most of these refugees gathered in Displaced Persons (DP) camps in the British, French and particularly American occupation zones of Germany, and in Austria and in Italy. The conditions in these camps were harsh and primitive at first, but once basic survival needs were being met, the refugees organized representatives on a camp-by-camp basis, and then a coordinating organization for the various camps, to present their needs and requests to the authorities, supervise cultural and educational activities in the camps, and advocate that they be allowed to leave Europe and immigrate to the British Mandate for Palestine or other countries. The first meeting of representatives of survivors in the DP camps took place a few weeks after the end of the war, on 27 May 1945, at the St. Ottilien camp, where they formed and named the organization \\"Sh'erit ha-Pletah\\" to act on their behalf with the Allied authorities. After most survivors in the DP camps had immigrated to other countries or resettled, the Central Committee of She'arit Hapleta disbanded in December 1950 and the organization dissolved itself in the British Zone of Germany in August 1951. The term \\"Sh'erit ha-Pletah\\" is thus usually used in reference to Jewish refugees and displaced persons in the period after the war from 1945 to about 1950. In historical research, this term is used for Jews in Europe and North Africa in the five years or so after World War II. Displaced persons camps After the end of World War II, most non-Jews who had been displaced by the Nazis returned to their homes and communities. For Jews, however, tens of thousands had no homes, families or communities to which they could return. Furthermore, having experienced the horrors of the Holocaust, many wanted to leave Europe entirely and restore their lives elsewhere where they would encounter less antisemitism. Other Jews who attempted to return to their previous residences were forced to leave again upon finding their homes and property stolen by their former neighbors and, particularly in central and eastern Europe, after being met with hostility and violence. Since they had nowhere else to go, about 50,000 homeless Holocaust survivors gathered in Displaced Persons (DP) camps in Germany, Austria, and Italy. Emigration to the Mandatory Palestine was still strictly limited by the British and emigration to other countries such as the United States was also severely restricted. The first groups of survivors in the DP camps were joined by Jewish refugees from central and eastern Europe, fleeing to the British and American occupation zones in Germany as post-war conditions worsened in the east. By 1946, an estimated 250,000 displaced Jewish survivors ‚Äì about 185,000 in Germany, 45,000 in Austria, and 20,000 in Italy ‚Äì were housed in hundreds of refugee centers and DP camps administered by the armies of the United States, Great Britain and France, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Survivors initially endured dreadful conditions in the DP camps. The camp facilities were very poor, and many survivors were suffering from severe physical and psychological problems. Aid from the outside was slow at first to reach the survivors. Furthermore, survivors often found themselves in the same camps as German prisoners and Nazi collaborators, who had been their tormentors until just recently, along with larger number of freed non-Jewish forced laborers, and ethnic German refugees fleeing the Soviet army, and there were frequent incidents of anti-Jewish violence. Within a few months, following the visit and report of President Roosevelt's representative, Earl G. Harrison, the United States authorities recognized the need to set up separate DP camps for Jewish survivors and improve the living conditions in the DP camps. The British military administration, however, were much slower to act, fearing that recognizing the unique situation of the Jewish survivors might somehow be perceived as endorsing their calls to emigrate to Palestine and further antagonizing the Arabs there. Thus, the Jewish refugees tended to gather in the DP camps in the American zone.Report of Earl G. Harrison. As cited in United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, \\"Resources,\\" Life Reborn: Jewish Displaced Persons, 1945-1951The New York Times, 30 Sept. 1945, \\"President Orders Eisenhower to End New Abuse of Jews, He Acts on Harrison Report, Which Likens Our Treatment to That of the Nazis,\\"Robert L. Hilliard, \\"Surviving the Americans: The Continued Struggle of the Jews After Liberation\\" (New York: Seven Stories Press, 1997) p. 214 The DP camps were created as temporary centers for facilitating the resettlement of the homeless Jewish refugees and to take care of immediate humanitarian needs, but they also became temporary communities where survivors began to rebuild their lives. With assistance sent from Jewish relief organizations such as the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) in the United States and the Jewish Relief Unit in Britain, hospitals were opened, along with schools, especially in several of the camps where there were large numbers of children and orphans, and the survivors resumed cultural activities and religious practices. Many of their efforts were in preparations for emigration from Europe to new and productive lives elsewhere. They established committees to represent their issues to the Allied authorities and to a wider audience, under the Hebrew name, Sh'erit ha-Pletah, an organization which existed until the early 1950s. Political life rejuvenated and a leading role was taken by the Zionist movement, with most of the Jewish DPs declaring their intention of moving to a Jewish state in Palestine. The slow and erratic handling of the issues regarding Jewish DPs and refugees, and the substantial increase of people in the DP camps in 1946 and 1947 gained international attention, and public opinion resulted in increasing political pressure to lift restriction on immigration to countries such as the US, Canada, and Australia and on the British authorities to stop detaining refugees who were attempting to leave Europe for Palestine, and imprisoning them in internment camps on Cyprus or returning them to Europe. Britain's treatment of Jewish refugees, such as the handling of the refugee ship Exodus 1947, shocked public opinion and added to international demands to establish an independent state for the Jewish people. This led Britain to refer the matter to the United Nations which voted in 1947 to create a Jewish and an Arab state. Thus, when the British Mandate in Palestine ended in May 1948, the State of Israel was established, and Jewish refugee ships were immediately allowed unrestricted entry. In addition, the United States also changed its immigration policy to allow more Jewish refugees to enter under the provisions of the Displaced Persons Act, while other Western countries also eased curbs on emigration. The opening of Israel's borders after its independence, as well as the adoption of more lenient emigration regulations in Western countries regarding survivors led to the closure of most of the DP camps by 1952. F√∂hrenwald, the last functioning DP camp closed in 1957. About 136,000 Displaced Person camp inhabitants, more than half the total, immigrated to Israel; some 80,000 emigrated to the United States, and the remainder emigrated to other countries in Europe and the rest of the world, including Canada, Australia, South Africa, Mexico and Argentina. Searching for survivors As soon as the war ended, survivors began looking for family members, and for most, this was their main goal once their basic needs of finding food, clothing and shelter had been met. Local Jewish committees in Europe tried to register the living and account for the dead. Parents sought the children they had hidden in convents, orphanages or with foster families. Other survivors returned to their original homes to look for relatives or gather news and information about them, hoping for a reunion or at least the certainty of knowing if a loved one had perished. The International Red Cross and Jewish relief organizations set up tracing services to support these searches, but inquiries often took a long time because of the difficulties in communications, and the displacement of millions of people by the conflict, the Nazi's policies of deportation and destruction, and the mass relocations of populations in central and eastern Europe. Location services were set up by organizations such as the World Jewish Congress, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) and the Jewish Agency for Palestine. This resulted in the successful reunification of survivors, sometimes decades after their separation during the war. For example, the Location Service of the American Jewish Congress, in cooperation with other organizations, ultimately traced 85,000 survivors successfully and reunited 50,000 widely scattered relatives with their families in all parts of the world. However, the process of searching for and finding lost relatives could take years, and for many survivors continued until their end of their lives. In many cases too, survivors search all their lives for family members, without learning of their fates. =Lists of survivors= Initially, survivors simply posted hand- written notes on message boards in the relief centers, Displaced Person's camps or Jewish community buildings where they were located, in the hope that family members or friends for whom they were looking would see them, or at the very least, that other survivors would pass on information about the people whom they were seeking. Others published notices in DP camp and survivor organization newsletters, and in newspapers, in the hopes of reconnecting with relatives who had found refuge in other places. Some survivors contacted the Red Cross and other organizations who were collating lists of survivors, such as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which established a Central Tracing Bureau to help survivors locate relatives who had survived the concentration camps. Various lists were collated into larger booklets and publications, which were more permanent than the original notes or newspaper notices. One such early compilation was called \\"Sharit Ha-Platah\\" (Surviving Remnant), published in 1946 in several volumes with the names of tens of thousands of Jews who survived the Holocaust, collected mainly by Abraham Klausner, a United States Army chaplain who visited many of the Displaced Persons camps in southern Germany and gathered lists of the people there, subsequently adding additional names from other areas. The first \\"Register of Jewish Survivors\\" (Pinkas HaNitzolim I) was published by the Jewish Agency's Search Bureau for Missing Relatives in 1945, containing over 61,000 names compiled from 166 different lists of Jewish survivors in various European countries. A second volume of the \\"Register of Jewish Survivors\\" (Pinkas HaNitzolim II) was also published in 1945, with the names of some 58,000 Jews in Poland. Newspapers outside of Europe also began to publish lists of survivors and their locations as more specific information about the Holocaust became known towards the end of, and after, the war. Thus, for example, the German-Jewish newspaper \\"Aufbau\\", published in New York City, printed numerous lists of Jewish Holocaust survivors located in Europe, from September 1944 until 1946. Over time, many Holocaust survivor registries were established. Initially these were paper records, but from the 1990s, an increasing number of the records have been digitized and made available online. =Hidden children= Following the war, Jewish parents often spent months and years searching for the children they had sent into hiding. In fortunate cases, they found their children were still with the original rescuer. Many, however, had to resort to notices in newspapers, tracing services, and survivor registries in the hope of finding their children. These searches frequently ended in heartbreak ‚Äî parents discovered that their child had been killed or had gone missing and could not be found. For hidden children, thousands who had been concealed with non-Jews were now orphans and no surviving family members remained alive to retrieve them. For children who had been hidden to escape the Nazis, more was often at stake than simply finding or being found by relatives. Those who had been very young when they were placed into hiding did not remember their biological parents or their Jewish origins and the only family that they had known was that of their rescuers. When they were found by relatives or Jewish organizations, they were usually afraid, and resistant to leave the only caregivers they remembered. Many had to struggle to rediscover their real identities. In some instances, rescuers refused to give up hidden children, particularly in cases where they were orphans, did not remember their identities, or had been baptized and sheltered in Christian institutions. Jewish organizations and relatives had to struggle to recover these children, including custody battles in the courts. For example, the Finaly Affair only ended in 1953, when the two young Finaly brothers, orphaned survivors in the custody of the Catholic Church in Grenoble, France, were handed over to the guardianship of their aunt, after intensive efforts to secure their return to their family. In the twenty first century, the development of DNA testing for genealogical purposes has sometimes provided essential information to people trying to find relatives from whom they were separated during the Holocaust, or to recover their Jewish identity, especially Jewish children who were hidden or adopted by non-Jewish families during the war. Immigration and absorption Young Holocaust survivors aboard the refugee ship Mataroa arrive in Haifa port, July 1945 After the war, anti-Jewish violence occurred in several central and Eastern European countries, motivated to varying extents by economic antagonism, increased by alarm that returning survivors would try to reclaim their stolen houses and property, as well as age-old antisemitic myths, most notably the blood libel. The largest anti-Jewish pogrom occurred in July 1946 in Kielce, a city in southeastern Poland, when rioters killed 41 people and wounded 50 more. As news of the Kielce pogrom spread, Jews began to flee from Poland, perceiving that there was no viable future for them there, and this pattern repeated itself in other countries such as Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and the Ukraine. Most survivors sought to leave Europe and build new lives elsewhere. Thus, about 50,000 survivors gathered in Displaced Persons (DP) camps in Germany, Austria, and Italy and were joined by Jewish refugees fleeing from central and eastern Europe, particularly Poland, as post-war conditions there worsened. By 1946, there were an estimated 250,000 Jewish displaced persons, of whom 185,000 were in Germany, 45,000 in Austria, and about 20,000 in Italy. As the British Mandate in Palestine ended in May 1948 and the State of Israel was established, nearly two-thirds of the survivors immigrated there. Others went to Western countries as restrictions were eased and opportunities for them to emigrate arose. Rehabilitation=Medical carePsychological care Holocaust survivors suffered from the war years and afterwards in many different ways, physically, mentally and spiritually. Most survivors were deeply traumatized both physically and mentally and some of the effects lasted throughout their lives. This was expressed, among other ways, in the emotional and mental trauma of feeling that they were on a \\"different planet\\" that they could not share with others; that they had not or could not process the mourning for their murdered loved ones because at the time they were consumed with the effort required for survival; and many experienced guilt that they had survived when others had not. This dreadful period engulfed some survivors with both physical and mental scars, which were subsequently characterized by researchers as \\"concentration camp syndrome\\" (also known as survivor syndrome). Nonetheless, many survivors drew on inner strength and learned to cope, restored their lives, moved to a new place, started a family and developed successful careers. Social welfare=Restitution and reparationsMemoirs and testimonies Organizations and conferences A wide range of organizations have been established to address the needs and issues of Holocaust survivors and their descendants. Immediately following the war, Sh'erit ha-Pletah\\" was established to meet the immediate physical and rehabilitation needs in the Displaced Persons camps and to advocate for rights to immigrate. Once these aims had largely been met by the early 1950s, the organization was disbanded. In the following decades, survivors established both local, national and eventually international organizations to address longer term physical, emotional and social needs, and organizations for specific groups such as child survivors and descendants, especially children, of survivors were also set up. Starting in the late 1970s, conferences and gatherings of survivors, their descendants, as well as rescuers and liberators began to take place and were often the impetus for the establishment and maintenance of permanent organizations. Survivors In 1981, around 6,000 Holocaust survivors gathered in Jerusalem for the first World Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors. Child survivors A Jewish Brigade soldier and nurses of the Jewish Agency taking care of Jewish refugee children in Florence, Italy, 1944. Child survivors of the Holocaust were often the only ones who remained alive from their entire extended families, while even more were orphans. This group of survivors included children who had survived in the concentration camps, in hiding with non-Jewish families or in Christian institutions, or had been sent out of harm's way by their parents on Kindertransports, or by escaping with their families to remote locations in the Soviet Union, or Shanghai in China. After the war, child survivors were sometimes sent to be cared for by distant relatives in other parts of the world, sometimes accepted unwillingly, and mistreated or even abused. Their experiences, memories and understanding of the terrible events they had suffered as child victims of the Nazis and their accomplices was given little consideration. In the 1970s and 80s, small groups of these survivors, now adults, began to form in a number of communities worldwide to deal with their painful pasts in safe and understanding environments. The First International Conference on Children of Holocaust Survivors took place in 1979 under the auspices of Zachor, the Holocaust Resource Center. The conference and was attended by some 500 survivors, survivors‚Äô children and mental health professionals and established a network for children of survivors of the Holocaust in the United States and Canada. The International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors held its first international conference in New York City in 1984, attended by more than 1,700 children of survivors of the Holocaust with the stated purpose of creating greater understanding of the Holocaust and its impact on the contemporary world and establishing contacts among the children of survivors in the United States and Canada. The World Federation of Jewish Child Survivors of the Holocaust and Descendants was founded in 1985 to bring child survivors together and coordinate worldwide activities. The organization began holding annual conference in cities the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. Descendants of survivors were also recognized as having been deeply affected by their families‚Äô histories. In addition to the annual conferences to build community among child survivors and their descendants, members speak about their histories of survival and loss, of resilience, of the heroism of Jewish resistance and self-help for other Jews, and of the Righteous Among the Nations, at schools, public and community events; they participate in Holocaust Remembrance ceremonies and projects; and campaign against antisemitism and bigotry. Second Generation of survivors The \\"second generation of Holocaust survivors\\" is the name given to children born after World War Two to a parent or parents who survived the Holocaust. Although the second generation did not directly experience the horrors of the Holocaust, the impact of their parents' trauma is often evident in their upbringing and outlooks, and from the 1960s, children of survivors began exploring and expressing in various ways what the implications of being children of Holocaust survivors meant to them. The second generation of the Holocaust has raised several research questions in psychology, and psychological studies have been conducted to determine how their parents' horrendous experiences affected their lives, among them, whether psychological trauma experienced by a parent can be passed on to their children even when they were not present during the ordeal, as well as the psychological manifestations of this transference of trauma to the second generation. Soon after descriptions of concentration camp syndrome (also known as survivor syndrome) appeared, clinicians observed in 1966 that large numbers of children of Holocaust survivors were seeking treatment in clinics in Canada. The grandchildren of Holocaust survivors were also over-represented by 300% among the referrals to a child psychiatry clinic in comparison with their representation in the general population.Fossion, P., Rejas, M., Servais, L., Pelc, I. & Hirsch, S. (2003). \\"Family approach with grandchildren of Holocaust survivors,\\" American Journal of Psychotherapy, 57(4), 519-527. A communication pattern that psychologists have identified as a communication feature between parents who experienced trauma and their children has been referred to as the \\"connection of silence\\". This silent connection is the tacit assent, in the families of Holocaust survivors, not to discuss the trauma of the parent and to disconnect it from the daily life of the family. The parent's need for this is not only due to their need to forget and adapt to their lives after the trauma, but also to protect their children's psyches from being harmed by their depictions of the atrocities that they experienced during the Holocaust. Awareness groups have thus developed, in which children of survivors explore their feelings in a group that shares and can better understand their experiences as children of Holocaust survivors. Some second generation of survivors have also organized local and even national groups for mutual support and to pursue additional goals and aims regarding Holocaust issues. For example, in November 1979, the First Conference on Children of Holocaust Survivors was held and resulted in the establishment of support groups all over the United States. Many members of the \\"second generation\\" have sought ways to get past their suffering as children of Holocaust survivors and to integrate their experiences and those of their parents into their lives. For example, some have become involved in activities to commemorate the lives of people and ways of life of communities that were wiped out during the Holocaust. They research the history of Jewish life in Europe before the war and the Holocaust itself; participate in the renewal of Yiddish culture; engage in educating others about the Holocaust; fight against Holocaust denial, antisemitism and racism; become politically active, such as with regard to finding and prosecuting Nazis, or by taking up Jewish or humanitarian causes; and through creative means such as theater, art and literature, examine the Holocaust and its consequences on themselves and their families. In April 1983, Holocaust survivors in North America established the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants; the first event was attended by President Ronald Reagan and 20,000 survivors and their families. Amcha, the Israeli Center for Psychological and Social Support for Holocaust Survivors and the Second Generation was established in Jerusalem in 1987 to serve survivors and their families. Survivor registries and databases The Arolsen Archives-International Center on Nazi Persecution in Bad Arolsen, Germany, a repository of information on victims of Nazi persecution, including survivors. One of the most well-known and comprehensive archives of Holocaust-era records, including lists of survivors, is the Arolsen Archives-International Center on Nazi Persecution founded by the Allies in 1948 as the International Tracing Service (ITS). For decades after the war, in response to inquiries, the main tasks of ITS were determining the fates of victims of Nazi persecution and searching for missing people. The Holocaust Global Registry is an online collection of databases maintained by the Jewish genealogical website JewishGen, an affiliate of the Museum of Jewish Heritage - A Living Memorial to the Holocaust; it contains thousands of names of both survivors trying to find family and family searching for survivors. The Holocaust Survivors and Victims Database, maintained by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, contains millions of names of people persecuted under the Nazi regime, including concentration camp or displaced persons camp lists that can be searched by place name or keywords. The Benjamin and Vladka Meed Registry of Holocaust Survivors, created in 1981 by the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors to document the experiences of survivors and assist survivors and their families trying to trace missing relatives and friends, includes over 200,000 records related to survivors and their families from around the world. In partnership with the Arolsen Archives, the family history website Ancestry began digitizing millions of Holocaust and Nazi-persecution records and making them searchable online in 2019. Two distinct databases included in the records are the \\"Africa, Asia and European passenger lists of displaced persons (1946 to 1971)\\" and \\"Europe, Registration of Foreigners and German Individuals Persecuted (1939-1947)\\". The Holocaust Survivor Children: Missing Identity website addresses the issue of child survivors still hoping to find relatives or people who can tell them about their parents and family, and others who hope to find out basic information about themselves such as their original names, dates and place of birth, and parents‚Äô names, based on a photograph of themselves as a child.

Jones Jr. (born April 9, 1947) is an American academic administrator and educator. He began his career as a professor of Romance languages and other humanities. His administrative posts have included being vice provost of Southern Methodist University and dean of its Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences; president of Kalamazoo College; president of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut; and interim president of Sweet Briar College.  Early life and education  Jones was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1947. He graduated from the Georgia Military Academy in 1965. He received degrees from the University of Virginia, Emory University, the Sorbonne, and Columbia University. While at the University of Virginia, he was assistant director of the Virginia Glee Club.  Career =Early career Jones was professor and department chair of Romance languages and literature at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and he was also director of the university's summer language institute in France. He later served as preceptor for the department of French and Romance Philology at Columbia University. In the early 1990s, he was vice provost of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas and dean of its Dedman School of Humanities and Sciences, and he was also a professor of humanities there. Kalamazoo College Jones was president of Kalamazoo College in Kalamazoo, Michigan from 1996 to 2004, and he taught humanities there as well. He nearly doubled the college's endowment, and supported study-abroad and internship programs.  Trinity College  Jones assumed the role of president of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut on July 1, 2004. In 2007 he signed the Annapolis Group Presidents Letter, refusing to participate in or provide information to U.S. News & World Report or other college ranking organizations. In 2009, Jones faced criticism for allegedly raiding Trinity's Shelby Cullom Davis endowment and using funds in contravention of the wishes of the original donor. The college petitioned the Attorney General's office to broaden the use of funds from the Davis Endowment to include student scholarships in Economics. Professor Gerald Gunderson, the Shelby Cullom Davis Professor of American Business and Economic Enterprise at Trinity College filed a complaint with the Connecticut Attorney General's office and a review revealed that the college had for some years been drawing on the Davis endowment without approval. The college agreed to adhere to the original conditions of the endowment in late 2013, when Prof. Gunderson objected to excess funds being used for student scholarships and commenced litigation. Details of the situation are reviewed in \\"Another Cautionary Tale: The Shelby Cullom Davis Professorship of American Business and Economic Enterprise at Trinity College\\" in The Intelligent Donor's Guide to College GivingNeal, Anne D., and Michael B. Poliakoff, \\"The Intelligent Donor's Guide to College Giving (Second Edition)\\", American Council of Trustees and Alumni, March 2011. and in \\"Games Universities Play: And How Donors Can Avoid Them\\".Wooster, Martin Morse, \\"Games Universities Play: And How Donors Can Avoid Them\\", John Williams Pope Center for Higher Education Policy, September, 2011. Commenting on the case, the donor's daughter, Diana Cullom Davis Spencer, noted: \\"If colleges like Trinity undermine donors' confidence that they will respect their wishes, they place at risk the generous support they receive from our foundation and so many others‚Äîand the benefits that inure to millions of students from this largesse.\\" In the fall of 2012 he attempted to overhaul Trinity College's 160-year-old Greek system by, among other things, requiring all sororities and fraternities to become 50/50 male/female by 2016 or risk having their properties confiscated by the school and their members expelled. The plan received significant criticism; fraternity and sorority members said that going coed would effectively shut them down, some alumni threatened to withhold donations, and some alumni called for Jones' resignation. Following the controversy over the sorority and fraternity plans, in 2013 he was asked to retire a year early, and he stepped down on June 30, 2014.  Sweet Briar College  He served as interim president of Sweet Briar College in Sweet Briar, Virginia beginning in August 2014. On March 3, 2015, Jones surprised students, faculty and alumnae by announcing that the 114-year-old institution would close permanently in August 2015. He stated that the Board of Directors had come to two conclusions after deliberation: \\"The declining number of students choosing to attend small, rural, private liberal arts colleges and even fewer young women willing to consider a single-sex education,\\" and \\"the increase in the tuition discount rate that we have to extend to enroll each new class is financially unsustainable.\\" Critics of the announcement questioned Jones' claim that \\"to save Sweet Briar we would need $250 million into the permanent endowment tomorrow morning\\", pointing out that while the college had been running a deficit, it still had an endowment of $84 million and assets of $163.9 million, and that $250 million was the size of the endowment of the much larger University of Maryland. On March 30, 2015, the Amherst County attorney filed a lawsuit against Jones,\\"Sweet Briar Institute v. Paul G. Rice and James F. Jones, Jr.\\", Circuit Court of Amherst County, Virginia, March 30, 2015. alleging that the administration had continued to collect charitable donations towards its educational mission as it prepared to close, in violation of the intentions of the donors, and that it had violated Virginia's Uniform Trust Code by acting against the will of its founding documents. A vote of no confidence in Jones and the board of directors was issued at a faculty meeting and on April 24, 2015, the faculty of Sweet Briar College filed a lawsuit seeking more than $40 million in damages. The faculty case asserted that the college was not in dire financial distress; and noted that net assets rose from $126 million to $135 million, the endowment grew from $85 million to $95 million, and debt dropped from $42 million to $25 million in the past five years. Following a legal battle over the attempted closure of Sweet Briar, a mediation agreement to keep the college open required Jones to resign as Sweet Briar College president seven business days after that agreement gained court approval, and he stepped down on July 2, 2015.

A predominantly farming settlement that has existed for about a thousand years, it is now also important for private healthcare and property development. The population today accounts for 1710 inhabitants. There is no real municipal centre in terms of population density and importance; the \\"Warford Park\\" development is home to some 300 people. Its amenities include an on-site health/leisure club, tennis courts, the Warford Park Bowling Club and several acres of gardens, lake, and parkland. Great Warford does not have direct access to national transport networks, lacking both a railway and a bus station. It is, however, in the centre of \\"The Golden Triangle\\" subtended by Alderley Edge, Knutsford and Wilmslow. Thus, it is well served by various schools, shops, restaurants, and places of worship and entertainment. The North West's extensive motorway network is close enough without too much detrimental effect on its rural qualities. Not far away, there are a Manchester Airport, a successful local golf club, and an assortment of local footpaths, which provide the only remarkable tourist attractions. Defining Great Warford Great Warford can be defined as the area presided over by the Great Warford Parish Council. A slightly larger population can be estimated by inclusion of farmland (former or current) occupying space between the boundaries of Great Warford and neighbouring Chelford, Chorley, Marthall, Mobberley, and Nether Alderley. Area beyond this is assigned to other practicing parish councils. The core area can be considered to be the area encompassing the Stag's Head public house, Warford Crescent, and Warford Hall. The entirety of Great Warford is covered by the WA16 and SK9 postal areas. The local telephone area code is 01565, which it has in common with Knutsford but not nearby Alderley Edge. Welcome signs on all inroads define the Great Warford area, which belongs to the electoral district of Tatton. The \\"built- up\\" area of Great Warford has expanded much in the last 20 years. This is due to its origins as a farming settlement and the ‚Äògreenbelt' status of the general location. The area is policed by the Cheshire Police Authority. Unlike neighbouring Little Warford, Great Warford lacks a defining village hall. This has led to contention of Great Warford's official status as a village. There has been no official review to date. Perhaps the site with the most historical interest is the Great Warford Baptist Chapel on Merrimans Lane. Geography and climate=Topography and climate Great Warford covers an area of , making it a medium-sized village. Its primary geographical feature is Mobberley Brook, an unnavigable stream which crosses the outskirts of the village from west to east. The valley that it runs through is a floodplain surrounded by gently undulating farmland such as Springfield and Pownall House Farm. These farms and other similar ones present the origins of Great Warford as an agricultural settlement. Therefore, Great Warford is of irregular shape. Mobberley Brook is a tributary of the River Bollin. After flowing east through Chorley, it becomes the Whitehall Brook. Built environment Much of the local housing is Victorian in design. Council houses built during the early 20th century were occupied by local health workers from the 1950s onward and are now owned privately as semi-detached property. A new housing estate at Buttermere Drive now occupies the site were the hospital's administrative centre once stood. Other buildings of note include: *The Warford Hall. An old hall with a spire. Like many local buildings, it was formerly the property of the Mary Dendy Hospital. *The Great Warford Baptist Chapel. It is reputed to have been founded in 1640 by Parliamentary soldiers.[Cheshire, 1660-1780: Restoration to Industrial Revolution By John Howard Hodson Published 1978 [Eng.] Cheshire Community Council Publications Trust] *The Warford Park. It is the main centre of residences. It is a development of apartments and cottages built on the site of the former Mobberley Boys' School. The Park is home to some 300 people in 17 acres of parkland. *The Heathgate Farmhouse. A large, striking, white detached building with a showjumping course on its land. Parks and gardens Warford Green (lying next to Warford Crescent) is a large stomach-shaped green area populated by several large trees. The local residents used to hold an annual bonfire and fireworks party here every Guy Fawkes Night. The bonfire would be built during the preceding months relying entirely on contributions from the locals. This practice was halted by the Parish Council in the early 1990s due to health and safety concerns regarding its proximity to Merrimans Lane and its unregulated nature in general. The course at Wilmslow Golf Club (situated in Great Warford, despite its name) doubles as a recreational park and a woodland area, with several public footpaths traversing it. History=Early Great Warford Great Warford is mentioned in the Domesday Book under its contemporary name of ‚ÄòWarforde'. Its entry dates from 1086 and contains a list of local families and landowners (including Ralph the Huntsman). Role in Norman and Medieval Cheshire The village did not expand much in the Medieval and Norman periods due to its boundaries being defined agriculturally. Little Warford, Marthall, Nether Alderley, Chelford, Mobberley and Chorley (as Alderley Edge was then known) all had their own land which meant that expansion beyond the existing borders was impossible. Rise of modern Great Warford Great Warford's contribution to agriculture continued through the 20th century to the modern day. However, for the last 60 years, other industries such as leisure and healthcare have begun to dominate Great Warford's identity. Administrative history=Local government Great Warford was a township of the Alderley ancient parish in the Macclesfiled Hundred of Cheshire. Under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1876 the township of Great Warford became a civil parish in its own right.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10086061&c;_id=10001043 One-hundred-and-two acres were transferred to Mobberley civil parish in 1936. Between 1894 and 1974, Great Warford was part of Macclesfield Rural District. From 1974 the civil parish was served by the Borough of Macclesfield, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the new unitary authority of Cheshire East.Cheshire (Structural Changes) Order 2008 The Great Warford Parish Council has few major rights and/or obligations and are responsible to the higher authorities above them. They do, however, manage local amenities and have a watching brief on local issues, their opinion being noted by those higher authorities in matters concerning them such as local planning issues.Map of Great Warford.

The stretch of line between these two stations runs under a road bridge and past the fields at Dean Green. This excellent vantage point has been used constantly by trainspotters and railway enthusiasts to photograph trains, particularly during special runs. Bus Time ago, a regular bus ran to and from Alderley Edge from the bus stop at Warford Crescent. Now, the only bus route that passes through Great Warford is the 88 service, running every 30 minutes from Knutsford to Altrincham and back, via Wilmslow. Air The village has good access to Manchester Airport and is situated out of the main flight path. Road Access to the main national road network is provided by the A535 road which runs between Alderley Edge and Holmes Chapel. The B5085 also provides direct access to Knutsford, as well as a direct route to Wilmslow bypassing Alderley Edge. Society and culture=Leisure and entertainment There is one pub in Great Warford, the Frozen Mop. Wilmslow Golf Club has already been mentioned in this article. There is also an outdoor football pitch on Mill Lane which was once used by the Mary Dendy Football Team, a team originally made up of staff from the hospital which continues to play today although now open to all. The Cheshire Health Club & Spa, sited on Warford Park development in Faulkners Lane, offers a full gymnasium, swimming, various exercise training, personal coaches, tennis courts and much more. Literature and film The Cheshire County Council published ‚ÄòThe Baptist Chapel, Great Warford', a guide to the aforementioned chapel in 1989.

The name was chosen in June 1984 by a campus committee that considered many suggestions before settling on the nickname.  History  Once a name was chosen, a contest was run in the October 4, 1984 issue of The Journal, the Webster University student newspaper. At the time the contest was run, only the name Gorlok had been decided. The contest required the applicants to submit a sketch as well as a description of how they thought a Gorlok would look. The winning entry included a picture of a blue and yellow creature holding a hand-held pump sprayer. The first life-size reproduction of the Gorlok was not complete until 1988, and made its debut at the February 9, 1988 men's basketball game between Webster and St. Louis Christian College.

It is also known as the Glatthalbahn, Glatttalbahn or Glattalbahn (Gl-TB), although the latter name is now more commonly used to refer to the Stadtbahn Glattal, a nearby light rail system. The line runs from Wallisellen, where it diverges from the Zurich to Winterthur line, to Uster and Rapperswil. A second link from Zurich, via the Z√ºrichberg Tunnel, joins the line just before D√ºbendorf, and both routes are used by through trains from Zurich. The line also has junctions with the Effretikon to Hinwil line, at Wetzikon, and the T√∂sstalbahn, at R√ºti. At Rapperswil, it connects with the Lake Zurich right bank line, the Rapperswil to Ziegelbr√ºcke line, and the S√ºdostbahn over the Seedamm. The name Glattalbahn is German for Glattal railway, or Glatt valley railway. The river Glatt is a tributary of the river Rhine flowing from Greifensee lake to Glattfelden in Switzerland. History The original section of the railway line from Wallisellen to Uster was opened in 1856 by the Glatttalbahn company. That company was taken over by the Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen (VSB) one year later in 1857, and that company extended the line to Rapperswil. The VSB was in turn taken over by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) in 1902. The original roundhouse at Uster railway station is preserved. At Bubikon, the Wallisellen to Rapperswil line was crossed by the former Uerikon to Bauma railway (UeBB). The section of this line from Bubikon in the direction of Bauma was closed in 1948 and little now remains. The line towards Uerikon was largely closed at the same time, but a short stretch is still in use as a siding. Operation Today the line carries trains of the Zurich S-Bahn and freight traffic. The line is double track from Wallisellen to Uster, and is then single track with shorter stretches of double track between Aathal and Wetzikon, Bubikon and R√ºti, and Jona and Rapperswil. Whilst no single S-Bahn line traverses the full length of the line from Wallisellen to Rapperswil, no fewer than six lines traverse some part of the line, providing a high frequency of service to many stations.

Al-Qazwini said that it lives in the country of R≈´m (Byzantium) and that it has one horn with 42 hollow branches which, when the wind passes through them, produces a pleasant sound that makes the animals sit around and listen. Horns of those creatures, sometimes gifted to kings, can be played like flutes. When played on one side, they produce a cheerful sound, and when the other, the music is so sad it makes people cry. The scholar Al-Damiri stated a larger number of branches to 72 and al-Mustawfi made shadhavar a ferocious carnivore.

The Sagamore is a member of Historic Hotel of America,Historic Hotel of America the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History The Sagamore opened in 1883, financed by a number of prominent summer residents. It soon succeeded in attracting a wealthy clientele. The hotel was named after \\"the Sagamore\\", an American Indian character in the James Fenimore Cooper novel The Last of the Mohicans (1826). Several of Lake George's nearby islands are also named after characters from the book. Twice damaged by fire, in 1893 and 1914, the Sagamore was rebuilt in early 1921. A group of investors including Dr. William G. Beckers of New York City, one of the hotel's early stockholders, Adolph Ochs, the owner and publisher of the New York Times, Dr. Willy Myers, a New York City surgeon and William H. Bixby, a St. Louis industrialist, hired prominent local architect and structural engineer Robert Rheinlander to oversee the effort. Throughout its history, the Sagamore has been a social center for wealthy tourists and residents of Millionaires' Row, the stately mansions along Lake George's western shore. The hotel eventually fell into disrepair before closing its doors in 1981. In 1983, one hundred years after construction of the first Sagamore, builder and real estate developer Norman Wolgin of Philadelphia purchased the hotel and restored it. In the same year, the resort was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

I can find out more about their team over the Internet than just about any other way.\\" And in October 2006, Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber invited BigSoccer readers to submit questions, and his answers, whose subjects ranged from the league's marketing strategy to expansion, were posted on the site. History Founded by Jesse Hertzberg as personal hobby in 1995 with Ethan Beard joining in 1997, the site was originally located at www.inch.com/~huss and was created in the wake of the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States and in anticipation of the launch of Major League Soccer (which eventually was delayed from 1995 to 1996). The site was used to post links to MLS and US Soccer related news, with a particular focus on his local MLS team in New York (soon to be announced as the MetroStars, now known as the New York Red Bulls). In the beginning, a significant number of BigSoccer posters came from the North American Soccer (NAS) listserv. In the early to mid-90s, the NAS list was one of the best sources of information and one of the few opportunities for community for supporters of the United States men's national soccer team. With the advent of MLS, the NAS list soon sprouted listservs for many of the teams in the new league as well. As the \\"bulletin board\\" technology advanced, the listservs soon faded away. The site evolved in two directions, becoming two distinct sites, MetroFan.com and SoccerBoards.com (which evolved into the current BigSoccer.com). While MetroFan continued to focus on the local MLS squad and eventually evolved into MetroFanatic.com, SoccerBoards invited other MLS fan clubs to join an interactive forum where they could share news, gossip, opinions, etc. about their local MLS side, the league, and US Soccer, as well other soccer teams and leagues around the world. SoccerBoards continued to be a hobby for its founders until 2000, when, with financial backing from StarMedia Network, the business was renamed BigSoccer and became a full-time endeavor. The company acquired Matchday USA, a soccer magazine and online retailer, later that year. Though the magazine was subsequently shut down, the retail operations have grown substantially and today the BigSoccer Shop, in partnership with 365 and Eurosport, carries over 10,000 products from dozens of countries and hundreds of teams. In addition to NAS, many smaller online soccer communities migrated to BigSoccer. These include Soccer America Graffiti. Partnerships * In 2003, BigSoccer partnered with News Corporation's Fox Sports World to become the network's official online community provider. The relationship was terminated in 2004. * In August 2006, BigSoccer launched a partnership with Major League Soccer, to become the official supplier of online community tools to the league's and teams' official websites.

The northern part of the massif lies within Jotunheimen National Park. The massif rises quite slowly from lake Bygdin, and ends in an extremely steep wall to the north. The wall is about 500 to 700 m high. On the northern side of the massif, there are several glaciers, with Leirungsbrean as the greatest. On the southern slopes there are two smaller glaciers - the Kalveholobrean glaciers. All the glaciers have retreated in the later years. Eastern Kalveh√∏gde and the wall of Western seen from Mugna.The massif contains ten 2000 m summits, but the northwesternmost (in the foreground on the photo to the right) and the two easternmost (not visible) are normally seen as independent mountains. The prominence of most of the summits are less than 100 m, and most of the massif is a broad ridge or a plateau which makes it very popular among mountain skiers. The proximity to the National Route 51 adds to the popularity, and the massif is one of the definitely most visited in Jotunheimen. Because of the number of summits, there has been a need for more distinct names for all the seven summits, and the National Map Institute has decided upon the name Munken (the Monk) for the northeastern plateau - seen in the lowermost picture, Mugna (probably meaning huge) for the two central summits, Kalveh√∏gde (reindeer calf mountain) for the three western summits, and lastly Nordre Kalveholotind (northern reindeer calf hole peak) for the southwestern summit, which is the only summit which has a prominent, steep wall on the southern side of the massif. The massif is built mostly by gabbro rocks, a hard and resistant rock. The southern slopes and the plateaus consist mostly of talus, and there is very little plant life except lichen, moss and ranunculus glacialis. Snow sparrows and mountain grouses are frequent and reindeers can be seen, but they mostly prefer the grassy slopes down towards lake Bygdin. Munken - the flattest part of the plateau.The Eastern Kalveh√∏gde and the Mugna summit were both climbed in 1820 by the two students Balthazar Mathias Keilhau and Peter Christian Bianco Boeck, both later prominent scientists at the university of Christiania. This is considered to be the first real mountain expedition in Norwegian history, and these summits were the first to be climbed by the two friends. The rest of the summits have unknown first ascents. Brief hiking guide The massif is easily accessible from National Route 51 crossing the Valdresflyi plateau. You reach the two summits of Rasletind, which is part of the massif but considered being a separate mountain. From the summit of the greater Rasletind, the massif can be followed as far as Western Kalveh√∏gde, which is the highest summit with an elevation of 2208 m, but west of that summit, the plateau soon turns into a very steep and narrow edge, which needs equipment to be climbed. The southwestern summit of Nordre Kalveholotind and the northeastern summit of Munken branches off from the main massif, and they can be reached easily from the main massif. Mostly the massif is also easily accessible from lake Bygdin, but that constitutes a rather long hike along the lake. From Torfinnsbu, where the boat Bitihorn has a landing, the massif can also be reached after a rather strenuous and steep hike. The views from all the summits are great - since the massif is the southernmost and easternmost in Jotunheimen.

The act is judged as a violation based on its character, gravity, and scale. Acts of aggression include invasion, military occupation, annexation by the use of force, bombardment, and military blockade of ports. The crime of aggression is a crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The definitions and the conditions for the exercise of jurisdiction over this crime were adopted by consensus on 11 June 2010 at the Kampala Review Conference by the States Parties to the Court.  History  In 1998, at the Rome Conference that adopted the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (\\"the Statute\\"), the crime was included as one of the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court (Article 5.1) and over which any State that becomes party to the Statute accepts the Court's jurisdiction (Article 12.1). However, participants to the Rome Conference could not agree on the definition of the crime nor on further conditions for the Court's exercise of jurisdiction; the Statute did not allow the Court to exercise such jurisdiction until these outstanding issues were solved (Article 5.2). At the 2010 Review Conference (\\"the Conference\\"), States Parties agreed by consensus to adopt resolution RC/Res.6 accepting the amendments to the Statute adding the definition of the crime and the conditions for the exercise of jurisdiction over this crime.  Adopted amendments  * The adopted amendments to the Rome Statute included deletion of Article 5.2 of the Rome Statute that formerly stated \\"The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression once a provision is adopted in accordance with articles 121 and 123 defining the crime and setting out the conditions under which the Court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime. Such a provision shall be consistent with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\\" Part 2. Jurisdiction, admissibility and applicable law.

For the Court to actively exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, however, the amendments stipulate additional conditions: The amendments must have been ratified or accepted since a year by at least thirty States Parties, and in addition States Parties must ‚Äúactivate‚Äù the Court's jurisdiction through an additional decision to be taken on or after 1 January 2017 by a two thirds majority.  Definition  Under the Statute, the definition of \\"crime of aggression\\" is stated as follows:  Article 8 bis  :1. For the purpose of this Statute, ‚Äúcrime of aggression‚Äù means the planning, preparation, initiation or execution, by a person in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State, of an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations. :2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, ‚Äúact of aggression‚Äù means the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations. Any of the following acts, regardless of a declaration of war, shall, in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX) of 14 December 1974, qualify as an act of aggression: ::(a) The invasion or attack by the armed forces of a State of the territory of another State, or any military occupation, however temporary, resulting from such invasion or attack, or any annexation by the use of force of the territory of another State or part thereof; ::(b) Bombardment by the armed forces of a State against the territory of another State or the use of any weapons by a State against the territory of another State; ::(c) The blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State; ::(d) An attack by the armed forces of a State on the land, sea or air forces, or marine and air fleets of another State; ::(e) The use of armed forces of one State which are within the territory of another State with the agreement of the receiving State, in contravention of the conditions provided for in the agreement or any extension of their presence in such territory beyond the termination of the agreement; ::(f) The action of a State in allowing its territory, which it has placed at the disposal of another State, to be used by that other State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State; ::(g) The sending by or on behalf of a State of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries, which carry out acts of armed force against another State of such gravity as to amount to the acts listed above, or its substantial involvement therein.

The agency takes on two cases, one involving a college-aged boy who disappeared ten years earlier, and the other a local man who does not understand why his wife is so long away from home each day. The engagement of Mma Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni endures, as he gets her a diamond engagement ring, and takes on two children from the orphan farm. A crime against Mma Ramotswe does not come off, leading the culprit, maid to her fianc√©, to prison instead. One reviewer finds the writing both dignified and humorous, and describes the protagonist as imperturbable. Another quotes a dialogue in this novel as an excellent example how the author \\"plays the two cultures against each other\\" evenhandedly, the two cultures being the West and the \\"primitive\\" country of Botswana. The satire in the conversation is remarked as worthy of Mark Twain. Plot summary Newly engaged Mma Ramotswe is not impressed with Mr JLB Matekoni's maid, Florence Pena. Unknown to him, she has been sleeping in his bed with her men friends. Obvious to Mma Ramotswe is that she does not keep the house clean. The maid, sensing that the forthcoming marriage will involve unpleasant changes in her own life, attempts to plant a gun at Mma Ramotswe's home to have her jailed. Mr JLB Matekoni is maneuvered by Mma Potokwane, the matron of the orphan farm, into offering a home to Motholeli and Puso, a sister and brother orphaned in the bush. He worries that this may affect his engagement to Mma Ramotswe. He likes the girl, who displays an aptitude for, and interest in, the work of the garage. The first case is that of an American woman in her fifties who lost her son Michael Curtin in Africa ten years earlier. Mrs Curtin suspects he died but does not know and wants resolution. Mma Ramotswe meets the people who were involved in the community to which he belonged while his family lived in Gaborone. His attachment to the community kept him from returning to the US for his time at college. Mma Ramotswe speaks to the secretary in the college where one man from that time now teaches. It is the secretary's last day, and she dislikes the professor for what he did to a relative of hers, and to many other women. Mma Ramotswe encounters the professor, who is a womanizer, known for dishonest manipulation to gain favors from his female students. She mixes lies with the truth to him, in short uses blackmail, to pull the truth of the events from him. She was powerful against him, to keep herself in charge of the situation. The professor had just started seeing the young man's girlfriend Carla, and she was pregnant with the young man's son. Michael encountered the two together in a small hut. The two men fought; Michael ran and fell into a deep ditch (a donga) and broke his neck. Mma Ramotswe feels the goal is to let Mma Curtin come to peace, so she agrees not to bring any of this information to the police, as it ought to have been originally. They buried the son without telling anyone what happened. Next she meets Carla in Zimbabwe where she lives with that child, a son. She agrees to meet the mother of her long ago lover to tell her the story and let her meet her grandson. Mma Ramotswe sees Mr JLB Matekoni with the children on their day out shopping for new clothes. She meets them and understands that he has adopted them. She decides he is a very kind man, and takes the children to her house, where the family will live. Mr JLB Matekoni learns on a call to his garage that his maid has been arrested. Her plan turns against her, as her friend calls the police on her, and she ends up behind bars, all events occurring without her employer being aware of them, save for the end result. Mma Ramotswe accepts the case of Mr Badule, a butcher who suspects his wife of an affair. Mma Makutsi expresses her yearning to do detective work, and Mma Ramotswe promotes her to assistant detective, while also retaining her secretarial role. Mma Makutsi follows the wife and talks with the maids at the home where the wife goes. She discovers that the woman's son ‚Äì unknown to her husband ‚Äì is the son of another man, himself married to a wealthy wife, who is paying for the boy's private education. Mma Makutsi finds it difficult to tell a lie, but she understands the importance of not hurting the client with information he does not need to know. Forced to report to the client herself, she tells him his wife is seeing another man so that his son can get the private school education he needs. Mr Badule does not learn the son is not his biological son, which would crush him. All the adults continue as they had, and the boy stays in school. The solution of the butcher's case is the first test of Mma Makutsi's detective and diplomatic skills. Mma Ramotswe gives a small basket as a gift to Mrs Curtin, explaining the meaning of its designs as being the tears of a giraffe, meaning that we all have something to give, and the giraffe has its tears to give. Mrs Curtin's newly found grandson, is keen on geology, identifying rocks to Mma Ramotswe as the two walk outside while his mother tells his grandmother the events of ten years earlier. The boy looks at Mma Ramotswe's engagement ring and identifies it as cubic zirconium, not the diamond Mr JLB Matekoni and she thought they bought. Characters *Mma Precious Ramotswe: Owner of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Gaborone, Botswana. She is self-taught as a detective, and generally successful in resolving the cases brought to her. In her youth, she married a musician who was cruel to her. She had a baby who died soon after birth, and learned she could have no more children. She is in her thirties. She recently became engaged to marry Mr JLB Matekoni. She drives a tiny white van which she has had for 11 years. *Obed Ramotswe: Late father of Precious, who was a strong and wise man. She loves him dearly and often thinks of him as she solves her cases, and as she decides to become engaged to Mr JLB Matekoni and accept the orphans he took in. *Mr JLB Matekoni: Owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors garage, and possibly the best mechanic in Botswana. He is a very kind man, in his forties. *Mma Grace Makutsi: She is the secretary to Mma Ramotswe, very efficient, known for scoring 97 on her final exam at the secretarial college. She wears large glasses. She is one of a large family, and she struggled to pay the fees for her education. She has good insight into many situations, but lacks the ease in viewing life that marks her employer. She is in her twenties. *Mma Silvia Potokwane: Matron of the orphan farm outside Gaborone. She is a most persuasive woman, in seeking help for her orphans and keeping the place running. Mr JLB Matekoni donates his time and skill to keep water pumps and the vehicles in running condition. He has known her since his childhood, as she was a friend of his mother. *Florence Pena: Maid to Mr JLB for many years. She is upset that her employer is engaged to Mma Ramotswe, who calls her out for the dirty state of his house on her first visit there. She plots to get Mma Ramotswe arrested for having a gun in her home, which plot turns on her, so that she is arrested for having a gun in her own house. *Motholeli: Twelve-year-old girl now living at the orphan farm. Her mother died when she was 7, of snake bite. The custom of her people was to bury a newborn still nursing with the mother, if the mother died for any reason. Motholeli recovered her brother from the shallow grave and headed for the road, where a kind couple picked her up. She and the baby were in hospital, as Motholeli had tuberculosis and the boy needed care. Recovered from the worst of it, a woman at the hospital takes the two of them home. She has a recurrence of TB that leaves her unable to walk, and she uses a wheelchair. When that family must relocate for the husband's job, she and her young brother are placed at the orphan farm, a few months before the story starts. *Puso: Five years younger brother of Motholeli. He is a lively boy, well-behaved like his sister, who has been caring for him since his birth. He and his sister are of the Basarwa people of Gaborone, hunter-gatherers who live in the bush. *Andrea Curtin: American widow, age 55, who lived in Gaborone ten to twelve years earlier with her husband and son. The son disappeared in Botswana after she and her husband returned to the US. Her husband died a few years earlier, and she seeks resolution of the fate of her son, asking Precious Ramotswe to help her. *Michael Curtin: Son of American client of Mma Ramotswe, who arrived in Gaborone with his parents just after completing high school. He put off college for a year to stay in Africa. He joined a community of people who thought they could farm the desert near Molepolole, a city about 50 km from Gaborone. He disappeared ten years before the story begins, and no investigations at the time revealed what happened to him. *Dr Oswald Ranta: Professor of economics who lived in the community ten years earlier, and who knew the facts of the fate of Mrs Curtin's son. He is a man with evil in his character, a man of no morals, who is accustomed to ordering people about, mistreating women and lying to manipulate people. *Carla Smit: Michael's lover and mother of his son, at the community in the rural area near Molepolole. She took up with Ranta as well. She is an Afrikaans woman from South Africa. After Botswana, she took a job in Bulawayo after leaving Botswana. She has a nine-year-old son. *Mr Letsenyane Badule: Owner of his own butcher shop, Honest Deal Butchery, and a man who had risen in another company based on his ability to root out dishonesty and thievery that increased the success of that company. He is married and has a son. His wife is a beautiful woman, dressing in the best of taste. He does not understand how she has the money for her clothes, nor how she found the money to pay for tuition for their son's private schooling. He is very proud of his son. She is not home much. He comes to Mma Ramotswe to learn the truth, as he fears his wife is seeing another man. *Rose: Maid to Mma Ramotswe. She is conscientious and reliable, a strong contrast to Florence Peno, the maid the Mr JLB Matekoni. Reviews Publishers Weekly mentioned the book, saying \\"Alexander McCall Smith (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency) offers the second and third installments of his dignified, humorous Botswanan series. In Tears of the Giraffe, PI Precious Ramotswe tracks a missing American man whose widowed mother appeals to Ramotswe; meanwhile, the imperturbable detective is endangered at home by her fianc√©'s resentful maid.\\" In a review of a later book in the series, Janet Malcolm mentions an aspect of the author's writing that shows best in this second novel of the series: \\"McCall Smith follows the satiric literary tradition in which a \\"primitive\\" culture is held up to show the laughable backwardness of Western society. . . . To illustrate the brilliant evenhandedness with which McCall Smith plays the two cultures against each other, here is a conversation between Mma Potokwane and Mr JLB Matekoni that takes place in Tears of the Giraffe, the second book of the series.\\" She quotes the conversation in Tears of the Giraffe between Mr JLB Matekoni and Mma Potokwane, matron of the orphan farm, after she has been reading some of Freud's works, finding them not wholly useful. She says that \\"The passage is a tour de force of double-edged irony\\" and she considers some of the remarks in that dialogue worthy of Mark Twain. She mentions the \\"playfulness\\" of McCall Smith in these novels, keeping them from being heavy- handed morality tales. Publication history Per Kirkus Reviews, the novels had their American publication later than in the UK. The first three novels appeared in 2002 in the US. In their review of the first novel in the series, Kirkus Reviews notes that \\"The first American publication of this 1999 debut has been preceded by two special Booker citations and two sequels, Tears of the Giraffe (2000) and Morality for Beautiful Girls (2001), both forthcoming in the series.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Penguin Readers Teacher Support Programme Teacher‚Äôs notes Level 4 for Tears of the Giraffe 2000 British novels Novels by Alexander McCall Smith Novels set in Botswana The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency ","title":"Tears of the Giraffe"},{"id":"6374264","text":"10 Tauri is a single star in the zodiac constellation of Taurus.

It was a former vent of Surtsey, along with Syrtlingur and Surtla. It emerged from the ocean as a result of active plate tectonics between December, 1965 and July, 1966. Oceanic erosion cyclically wore down the new lava as it formed, and the island sank below the surface several times.Brief description from Dartmouth, (at the end of the report)The Surtsey Research Society, The Surtsey Eruption 1963-1967 It was named for J√≥lnir, a Norse god (usually identified as a second name for Odin). J√≥lnir's formation is closely linked to that of neighboring volcanic island, Surtsey, which emerged in 1963. Volcanic eruptions occurred in much of the surrounding water, but newly formed land was subject to erosion and many small islands washed away. By 1966, J√≥lnir had broken the surface and a volcanic cone of mafic tephra developed. The volcanic cone reached above sea level, but even this landmass eventually gave way to the eroding ocean waves. After volcanic activity ceased on 8 August 1966, the Atlantic Ocean's waves rapidly eroded the volcanic island.

Many became so wealthy that they adopted the lifestyle of aristocrats, lavishing vast sums on great houses and splendid churches. History The \\"Triangular Trade\\" In 1707, the Treaty of Union between Scotland and England gave Scottish merchants access to the English colonies, especially in North America. Glasgow's position on the River Clyde, where the westerlies hit Europe as well as in other places like Bristol, Nantes, or Bordeaux, may have been an opportunity for its merchants. The French monarchy granted to Glasgow in 1747 a monopoly for the importation of tobacco into French territories. The deepening of the Clyde in 1768 provided a further advantage, because Glasgow ships were built specifically for the Atlantic crossing and were generally bigger than those of other ports. The tobacco trade was part of broader trade that linked exports of consumer and manufactured goods from Europe with the North American and Caribbean colonies. Operated with slave labour, these colonies supplied products that found a ready market in Britain and the rest of Europe . The triangle involved merchants carrying UK manufactured goods to West Africa to sell or exchange for slaves which they transported on to America and the Caribbean. On the third leg back to the UK they carried tobacco, rum, cotton, sugar and the like. From 1710, Glasgow became the centre of an economic boom which lasted nearly fifty years. The Tobacco Lords personified this boom and were the nouveau riche of the mid-eighteenth century. Arguably the most successful of these merchants was John Glassford, who entered the tobacco trade in 1750 and had soon acquired a fleet of vessels and many tobacco stores across New England. Celebrated in his lifetime, Glassford was the most extensive ship owner of his generation in Scotland, and one of the four merchants who laid the foundation of the commercial greatness of Glasgow through the tobacco trade. Tobias Smollett wrote of a meeting with Glassford in 1771: Palaces and churches William Cunninghame's neo-classical mansion on Queen St, Glasgow, built in 1780 at a cost of ¬£10,000 St Andrew's in the Square Glasgow merchants made such fortunes that they adopted the style of aristocrats in their superior manner and in their lavish homes and churches. The merchants' Calvinist background made sure, however, that display was always of rich but sober materials ‚Äì black silk clothes, (though startlingly set off by scarlet cloaks), black three-cornered hats, silver- (or even gold)-tipped ebony canes, mahogany furniture, and classical architecture in their domestic and public use. Their mansions were laid out on the western boundaries of the 18th century city, where they gave their names to later streets in what modern Glasgow now calls the Merchant City. Other streets recall the triangular trade more directly, with modern streets bearing names like Virginia Street and Jamaica Street. Among the important Tobacco Lords whose mansions gave their names to streets were Andrew Buchanan, James Dunlop,http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/smihou/smihou044.htm Archibald Ingram, James Wilson, Alexander Oswald,http://www.electricscotland.com/history/glasgow/glasgow3_29.htm Andrew Cochrane,http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSBH11 and John Glassford.http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSBH02 The Virginia Mansion of Alexander SpeirsTGS - 1560 to 1770s - Personalities - Alexander Speirs gave Virginia Street its name, and Alexander gave his surname to Speirs Wharf in Port Dundas. Some idea of the grandeur of the Tobacco Lords' houses - which often dramatically punctuated the ends of the streets named after them ‚Äì can be had in the original core of Glasgow. The Gallery of Modern Art, which today occupies the (greatly expanded and embellished by later reconstruction as the Exchange) mansion built for William Cunninghame in 1780, at a cost of ¬£10,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). A more modest Tobacco Merchants House (by James Craig, 1775) is being restored at 42 Miller Street. St Andrew‚Äôs Parish Church in St Andrew‚Äôs Square, built 1739‚Äì1756 by Alan Dreghorn was the Tobacco Lord's ostentatious parish church, in a prestigious area being laid out by such merchants as David Dale (who was not involved in the tobacco trade). In the same area was the grand house of Alexander Speirs. St Andrew's in the Square still survives today and is considered one of the finest classical churches in Britain, Today it is Glasgow's Centre for Scottish Culture, promoting Scottish music, song and dance. The church is located in St Andrew's Square, near Glasgow Cross and Glasgow Green, on the edge of the City's East End. The church, inspired by St Martin-in-the-Fields in London, was built between 1739 and 1756 by Master Mason Mungo Naismith. It was the first presbyterian church built after the Reformation, and was commissioned by the city's Tobacco Lords as a demonstration of their wealth and power. American Revolution During the 1760s tensions grew between Britain and her American colonies, amongst which were economic stresses arising out of the perceived unfairness of the tobacco trade. The market in tobacco was dominated by the Glasgow merchants who manipulated prices (as the colonists claimed) and caused great distress among Maryland and Virginia planters, who by the time of the outbreak of war had accumulated debts of around ¬£1 million, a huge sum at the time (equivalent to ¬£ in ). These debts, as much as the taxation imposed by Westminster, were among the colonists' most bitter grievances.Oliver, Neil, p.340 It was this extension of cheap credit that made the Glasgow men different. The English merchants simply sold American tobacco in Europe and took a commission. The Scots bought the crop at pre-arranged prices, and made large (and potentially risky) loans to their customers. Prior to 1740, Glasgow merchants were responsible for the import of less than 10% of America's tobacco crop, but by the 1750s Glasgow handled more of the trade than the rest of Britain's ports combined. Heavily capitalised, and taking great personal risks, these men made immense fortunes from the \\"Clockwork Operation\\" of fast ships coupled with ruthless dealmaking and the manipulation of credit.Oliver, p.341 Maryland and Virginia planters were offered easy credit by the Glaswegian merchants, enabling them to buy European consumer goods and other luxuries before harvest time gave them the ready cash to do so. But, when the time came to sell the crop, the indebted growers found themselves forced by the canny traders to accept low prices for their harvest simply in order to stave off bankruptcy.Oliver, p342 At his Mount Vernon plantation, future President of the United States George Washington saw his liabilities swell to nearly ¬£2,000 by the late 1760s (equivalent to ¬£ in ).Randall, Willard Sterne. George Washington a Life. New York: Henry Holt &, 1998. Print. Thomas Jefferson, on the verge of losing his own farm, accused British merchants of unfairly depressing tobacco prices and forcing Virginia farmers to take on unsustainable debt loads. In 1786, he remarked: ::‚ÄúA powerful engine for this [mercantile profiting] was the giving of good prices and credit to the planter till they got him more immersed in debt than he could pay without selling lands or slaves. They then reduced the prices given for his tobacco so that‚Ä¶they never permitted him to clear off his debt.‚ÄùBreen, T. H. Tobacco Culture: the Mentality of the Great Tidewater Planters on the Eve of Revolution. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton UP, 1985. Print. After the war, few of the enormous debts owed by the colonists would ever be repaid. Despite these setbacks, after the American War of Independence (1775‚Äì1783) the canny Glasgow merchants switched their attention to other profitable parts of the triangular trade, particularly cotton in the British West Indies. Legacy The impact of the Tobacco Lords on Glasgow's architectural heritage remains today. St Andrew's in the Square is today Glasgow's Centre for Scottish Culture, promoting Scottish music, song and dance. William Cunninghame's (greatly expanded and embellished) mansion now houses the Glasgow Gallery of Modern Art.

It superseded previous versions of the Kodachrome process used with older films (such as K-12 for Kodachrome II and Kodachrome-X). The K-14 process differed significantly from its contemporary, the E-6 process, in both complexity and length. Kodachrome film has no integral color couplers; dyes are produced during processing (each color in a separate step) by the reaction of the color couplers with the oxidised developer.https://www.kodak.com/uploadedfiles/motion/US_plugins_acrobat_en_motion_education_kodak_color_films.pdf Due to declining sales, Kodak discontinued production of all K-14 chemistry in 2009, concurrently with Kodachrome 64 film. Dwayne's Photo, in Parsons, Kansas, operated the last K-14 line in the world, discontinued sales on December 30, 2010; the last roll was processed on January 18, 2011.  Steps  The layers in the film are, top-to-bottom: blue sensitive (yellow), yellow filter, blue-green sensitive (magenta), blue-red sensitive (cyan), acetate base, rem-jet antihalation backing. The processing cycle is as follows: # Backing removal: An alkaline bath softens the cellulose acetate phthalate binder. A spray wash and buffer removes the rem-jet anti-halation backing. # First Developer: All exposed silver halide crystals are developed to metallic silver via a PQ developer. The yellow filter layer becomes opaque because it has a combination of Lippmann emulsion (very tiny grains) and Carey Lea silver (metallic silver particles that are small enough that they are yellow rather than gray.) # Wash # Red light re-exposure through the base: This makes the remaining undeveloped silver halide in the cyan layers developable. # Cyan developer: The solution contains a color developer and a cyan coupler. These are colorless in solution. After the color developer develops the silver, the oxidized developer reacts with the cyan coupler to form cyan dye. The dye is much less soluble than either the developer or the coupler so it stays in the red layer of the film. # Wash # Blue light re-exposure from the top: This makes the remaining undeveloped grains in the blue sensitive layer (the yellow layer) developable. The now opaque yellow filter layers prevents the blue light from exposing the magenta layer (the green sensitive layer, which is also sensitive to blue light). It is important to avoid stray printing light exposing the film base of film. # Yellow developer: Analogous to the cyan developer. # Wash # Magenta developer: This contains a chemical fogging agent that makes all of the remaining undeveloped silver developable. If everything has worked correctly, nearly all of this silver is in the magenta layers. The developer and magenta coupler work just like the cyan and yellow developers to produce magenta dye that is insoluble and stays in the film. # Wash # Conditioner: Prepares the metallic silver for the bleach step. # Bleach: (ferric EDTA) Oxidises the metallic silver to silver halide. The bleach must be aerated. The former ferricyanide bleach did not require aeration and did not require a conditioner. # Fix: Converts the silver halide to soluble compounds which are then dissolved and washed from the film # Wash: Washes the fixer out of the film. # Rinse: Contains a wetting agent to reduce water spots. # Dry The result is three different color records each with the appropriate dye, just like other color films. The original Kodachrome process in 1935 used dye bleaches and was a far more complex process. Although the formulae have changed over the years, the basic process steps have followed a similar pattern since the introduction of \\"selective re-exposure\\" Kodachrome in 1938.

Background and education Layton was the son of Alfred John Layton of Woking, Surrey, and Mary Johnson. He was educated at King's College School, Westminster City School, University College, London and Trinity College, Cambridge. Career He became a lecturer in economics at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1908, then from 1909 to 1914 he was a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College. A notable economist, Layton worked for the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War. In 1922 he was appointed editor of The Economist, a post he held until 1938, and from 1944 to 1963 was also Chairman of The Economist Newspaper Ltd. His editorship was of profound importance to the newspaper, and he was probably the person to whom it owes most thanks for its survival and continued independence. He was editorial director of the News Chronicle (1930‚Äì40), and returned to the Chronicle after the war, where he remained until the newspaper ceased publication in 1960.Dennis Griffiths (ed.) The Encyclopedia of the British Press 1422‚Äì1992, London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p.364 He was a member of the Liberal Party committee that produced Britain's Industrial Future, otherwise known as the Liberal Yellow Book. He stood as a Liberal Parliamentary candidate, contesting the London University seat in 1929. Layton was again drafted in to work for the government during the Second World War, holding positions in the Ministry of Supply (from May 1940) and the Ministry of Production. Head of Joint War Production Staff 1942 to 1943. After the war, he served as Vice- President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1949 to 1957. Honours Layton was made a CBE in 1917 and a Companion of Honour in 1919. He was knighted in 1930 and in 1947 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Layton, of Danehill in the County of Sussex. Liberal politics Layton stood unsuccessfully for parliament three times as a Liberal. He fought Burnley in 1922, Cardiff South in 1923 and in 1929 he switched again to fight the London University seat. However, Layton's importance in Liberal politics had much more to do with his work at the News Chronicle and The Economist where he became a prominent member of a group of Liberals who had a major influence on public opinion. Their orbits were the Whitehall and Westminster villages. They moved in Fleet Street, the City, and Oxbridge circles. Among their contemporaries were Maynard Keynes, William Beveridge, Gilbert Murray, and Seebohm Rowntree. Layton would later chair the executive committee of the Liberal Industrial Inquiry which produced the celebrated Yellow Book of 1928.

Baum, great-grandson of the author of the original Oz series, L. Frank Baum. It was first published in 1995 by Yellow Brick Road Press (). The Lion and Oscar both work in the circus, but when they go for a ride in Oscar's hot-air balloon, they find themselves in Oz. But the Lion falls out of the balloon and is separated from his friend. Once in Oz he finds that he can talk and soon meets up with the Wicked Witch of the East. The witch sends Lion on a journey to find the Flower of Oz, the source of all things good in the land. On his way he meets a mysterious girl who is accompanied by animated toys, and they set off together to find the Flower of Oz. On the way they come to many adventures, an evil seamstress who's working for the Wicked Witch of the East, mini munchkins, and The Wizard of Oz himself. But if Lion doesn't find the flower in time, he will lose his badge of courage to the witch. Prior to 'The Wizard of Oz' After landing in the land of Oz, Lion of Oz depicts the Lion on a quest to reunite with his friend, the Wizard of Oz. For the duration of the quest, the Lion has a Badge of Courage which makes him exceedingly brave. As he travels across the land, he finds himself repeatedly threatened and manipulated by the Wicked Witch of the East. At the end of this story, he befriends the Flower of Oz, a seemingly great magical power that the witch seeks; Together the two defeat the Witch. However, the Lion's Badge of Courage is broken in the process and he becomes cowardly. In shame, he leaves his friends and takes off on his own through the forests, where he eventually meets Dorothy, the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow. The Lion travels with Dorothy, the Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow, and Toto on the yellow brick road on their journey to see the Wizard of Oz. He tells his new companions that he is cowardly and wishes to see the wizard to regain his courage. However, during the course of the book, the Cowardly Lion seems to be the bravest member of the party, showing a willingness to stand by and defend his friends even if it involves certain death. When the group reaches the Emerald City at the end of the book, the Wizard gives the Lion a placebo Badge of Courage which makes him believe he has regained his courageous nature.

It is the type genus of the family Stephanoceratidae. Selected species *Stephanoceras blagdeni (Sowerby) *Stephanoceras boulderense Imlay 1982 *Stephanoceras coronatus (Bruguiere, 1789) *Stephanoceras humphriesianum Sowery 1825) *Stephanoceras quenstedti –öoche 1939 *Stephanoceras skidegatense Whiteaves 1876 Global Names Index Description Stephanoceras has an evolute shell, as characteristic of the family, with well-developed ribbing and tubercles. The shell is coiled so whorls barely touch in most, but some have notable overlap. Primary ribs emerge from the umbilical seam, the line marking the inner edge of the particular exposed whorl, and divide on the flanks, usually in two, occasionally in three, forming secondary ribs that cross the outer rim of the shell, known as the venter, uninterrupted. Turbercles, elevated projections, form at the ends of the primary ribs where they bifurcate or sometimes trifurcate. Stephanoceras grew to be fairly large with a shell diameter as much as 27 cm and width as much as 6 cm across the outer whorl. Like many ammonites, Stephanoceras is dimorphic with a large, macroconch, form thought to be female and a small, microconch, form thought to be male. In most aspects the microconch is simply a smaller version of the macroconch. The primary difference lies in the aperture, which in the microconch has planar extensions on either side, lappets. That of the macroconch is generally simple, preceded by a constriction. Distribution Fossils of Stephanoceras are found in the Jurassic marine strata of Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Spain. Some species, including S.coronatus and S.humphriesianum can also be found in rocks of the same age from England and Germany . References *Arkell, et al. 1957.

WEXP broadcasts an eclectic music format featuring nearly all types of rock, folk, bluegrass, blues and jazz with an effective radiated power of 350 watts with a directional antenna located atop \\"Grandpa's Knob\\" near Castleton, Vermont. WEXP features live, daily dialog with community service History The station's construction permit was originally owned by Tim Hoehn, Gary Savoie, and local resident Michael Carr who wound up selling a controlling interest to Jeff Shapiro. Although the transmitter is located a distance from Brandon, the tower site on Grandpa's Knob, in Castleton, Vermont, was the only place that would suffice to get a city grade signal over the majority of Brandon. An FCC waiver permitted this operation. A story in the Rutland Herald depicted a large type balloon being raised over a hilltop in Pittsford to describe how high a proposed tower could be. Several hunters shot the balloon down, since the people there did not want a tower erected in their town. WEXP went on the air in April 1999 under \\"Program Test Authority\\" from the FCC with no sales staff, no disc jockeys and only a Technics CD player airing the same repeating dance music CD with a legal ID imbedded, calling itself \\"Express 101\\". A contract engineer, Neil Langer, oversaw the operation and kept the station's public file at his residence. Langer built the facility where the station is currently housed in the Howe Center complex in Rutland. In October 2000, WEXP began to simulcast its signal over WVAY 100.7 (now WTHK) in Wilmington, Vermont and its translator W284AB in Jamaica, Vermont. Logo as \\"The Fox\\" On May 16, 2000, at noon, WEXP became Classic Rock 101, The Fox. The very first song played was \\"Long Live Rock\\" by The Who. The station's initial lineup included the syndicated Imus In The Morning show. Alicia Ty hosted the midday slot. Baker (from the Mason and Sheehan Show in Albany NY) was the first program director and afternoon host. John Roberts was hired a bit later, and handled the nighttime programming. \\"The Janitor\\" was around for the overnights, and was platooned with \\"Rachel Lee\\" in the overnight lineup. \\"Blade Michael\\" was the stations first part-time announcer hired, and remains with the station to this day. A $1.01 Gas promotion at a Citgo gas station in Fair Haven, Vermont that brought in hundreds of vehicles, over a three-hour time span was a catalyst in establishing the station as a player in the local marketplace. Several early DJs at the station have moved on to other stations such as Baker going to launch the former WRCZ, \\"Moose\\" Waters KAZR Des Moines, Iowa and \\"Sloppy\\" Joe going to KDAT in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The station's signal is directional to the southwest since it is short spaced to WNYQ 101.7 Glens Falls, NY and slightly to the southeast to protect WRSY 101.5 in Marlboro, Vermont. At one time, all three radio stations were owned by Vox Radio Group. The original allocation for the Brandon, Vermont frequency was 101.9 FM, and was moved to its current 101.5 frequency when WCVR-FM in Randolph, Vermont upgraded from a class A at 102.3 FM to a class C3 at 102.1. The original call sign for WEXP was WADT, which was used from 1993 to 1998, though the station never made it on the air under the WADT calls. The WEXP calls were previously used on WKOL Plattsburgh, New York until 1995, and on WSGN-FM in Gadsden Alabama from 1975 until 1984. WEXP, along with 29 other Nassau stations in northern New England, was purchased at bankruptcy auction by Carlisle Capital Corporation, a company controlled by Bill Binnie (owner of WBIN-TV in Derry), on May 22, 2012. The station, and 12 of the other stations, would then be acquired by Vertical Capital Partners, controlled by Jeff Shapiro; however, as this would put Shapiro over the Federal Communications Commission's ownership limits in the Lebanon-Rutland-White River Junction market, WEXP and WWOD would be acquired by Electromagnetic Company, a company controlled by William and Gail Goddard. Simulcast station WTHK was not included in this deal and would remain with Shapiro. (updated June 14, 2012) This transaction was consummated on November 30, 2012, with the WEXP/WWOD portion valued at a price of $600,000. On December 10, 2012, Scott Fybush reported that Radio Vermont paid $475,000 to buy the station.NERW 12-10-2012 Nexstar Sinclair Upend Upstate TV WEXP's simulcast on WTHK ended on January 22, 2013; that station now simulcasts WXXK. The sale to Radio Vermont was completed on March 15, 2013. On June 12, 2014, Radio Vermont announced that WEXP would drop the classic rock format and launch an undisclosed music format branded as \\"101 The One\\" on July 1. The newest format is simulcast with WCVT (101.7 FM) in Stowe, and features what Ken Squier describes as \\"a new adult service local to Vermont.\\" Station ownership changed in 2019 and new owner David \\"Uncle Dave\\" Tibbs relaunched the station as a non-profit with an eclectic music format, branded as \\"101-5 WEXP, Community Radio for Rutland County and the Killington Valley.\\" WEXP is community oriented, featuring live, daily interviews with community service providers.

The role is roughly equivalent to the English castellan and the name derives from the German word for castle, Burg. Function Whether a Burgmann was a free knight, dienstmann or ministerialis, he was a member of the aristocracy who was charged by the Burgrave or lord of the castle (the Burgherr) with the so-called Burghut or castle-guard. In other words, his job was to guard the castle and defend it in case of attack. A fief had to be defended from incursion and the supporting farmland had to be run correctly, proper repairs and improvements had to be made, possibly fortifying key points and collecting taxes. Ministeriales replaced free nobles as castellans under Conrad I of Abensberg's tenure as Archbishop of Salzburg from 1106 to 1147.Freed, NB, p. 40. In 1131, Hohensalzburg saw its first ministerialis, Henry of Seekirchen, sit as both burgmann and burgrave, overseeing a permanent garrison of subordinate (free) knights.Freed, NMK, p. 590. Originally the Burgmann was paid in kind for his service although he had to provide his own armour. Later, he was given a so- called Burglehn as a remuneration which, from the late 13th century, was a fixed sum of money. From the 13th century on, the rights and duties of the Burgmann could be found to be governed by a written contract, the Burgmannvertrag. In addition to the place and times that a Burgmann had to be present at the castle, it laid down the necessary armament and equipment. The duty to be present - called residence duty (Residenzpflicht) - required the lord of the castle to provide his Burgm√§nner with a residence free of charge within the castle or at least in its immediate vicinity. Such residences were referred to as the Burgmann's residence (Burgmannsitz), estate (Burggut) or court/farm Burgmannshof. Many had judicial powers to govern, as in 1111, when the Salzburg burgmann caught a ministerial who fomented armed rebellion - he had the offender blinded for his temerity.Arnold, pp. 137-8. Sometimes several Burgm√§nner would be resident at one castle and, together, they made up the Burgmannschaft. They were subordinate to the Burgherr or to a castle commandant (Burgkommandant) commissioned by him, who frequently bore the title, burgrave (Burggraf). Because the Burgmann was subject to feudal law (Lehnsrecht), legal disputes involving feudal matters were handled by the burgrave. The noblemen of the Burgmannschaft were often supported in their work by common staff such as gatekeepers (Torwarte) and watchmen (T√ºrmer). Decline of Use The residence requirement of the Burgmannen was superseded by the introduction of armed servants or Knechte. With the introduction of such non-aristocratic castle contingents and the move from castles to fortifications in the late Middle Ages, the Burgmann system disappeared, and the Burghut was discharged by Kriegsknechte and mercenaries.

He is most widely known for his writings casting doubt on the commonly accepted version of events regarding the destruction of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks. He first wrote on the matter in the 13 September 2001, edition of the online magazine Telepolishttps://web.archive.org/web/20060819033522/http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/special/wtc.html and has subsequently published two books on 9/11: Verschw√∂rungen, Verschw√∂rungstheorien und die Geheimnisse des 11.9 was, under the title 'Conspiracies, Conspiracy Theories and the Secrets of 9/11, the only book promoting a 9/11 conspiracy theories to be translated into English from German. Its sequel was entitled Fakten, F√§lschungen und die unterdr√ºckten Beweise des 11.9, (Facts, Forgeries and the Suppressed Evidence of 9/11). Br√∂ckers stated that the unanimous opinion expressed by the media that Bin Laden was responsible made him suspicious: \\"Although it was the biggest police investigation of all time... one year after the attacks the amount of evidence gathered against those who allegedly masterminded them, Osama Bin Laden and his terrorist group Al Qaeda, comes to no more than it did only a few hours afterwards: virtually nothing.\\"http://www.broeckers.com/ Br√∂ckers does not accept that Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden planned and executed the 9/11 attacks. Br√∂ckers is a longstanding writer on conspiracy theories who was working on a book on conspiracy theories before the 9/11 attacks. As an admirer and translator of the work of novelist Robert Anton Wilson, co-author of The Illuminatus! Trilogy, Br√∂ckers was working a book on a \\"new science of conspirology\\" in Sept. 2001, which led to his work on 9/11. His proposed scheme of thought would include \\"a general theory of conspiracy theories\\" as a guide to assessing their validity, instead of \\"blindly demonizing\\" them. This proposed book does not appear to have been published. He assigns conspiracy a key role in history and biology as a powerful hybrid of the forces of competition and co-operation. Br√∂ckers is also a long-time activist and author advocating the legalization of hemp. In 1993 he co-authored the influential Die Wiederentdeckung der Nutzpflanze Hanf (The Rediscovery of the Agricultural Crop Hemp) with Jack Herer. His Albert Hofmann und die Entdeckung des LSD (the Discovery of LSD) was published in Jan. 2006. He has spoken at conferences promoting the use of LSD.

From its early history as an outpost and a threat against Native American residents, to its later days as a booming cattle town, to modern times as a corporate center, the city has changed dramatically, although it still preserves much of its heritage in its modern culture. Early history=Treaty of Bird's Fort The Treaty of Bird's Fort between the Republic of Texas and several Indian tribes was signed in 1843 at Bird's Fort in present- day Euless, Texas. Article XI of the treaty provided that no one may \\"pass the line of trading houses\\" (at the border of the Indians' territory) without permission of the President of Texas, and may not reside or remain in the Indians' territory. These \\"trading houses\\" were later established at the junction of the Clear Fork and West Fort of the Trinity River, where Fort Worth was later built by the US Army. At this river junction, the U.S. War Department established Fort Worth in 1849 as the northernmost of a system of forts for protecting the American Frontier after the end of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/forts/military.html The City of Fort Worth continues to be known as \\"where the West begins.\\" After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War In January 1849, U.S. Army General William Jenkins Worth, a veteran of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, proposed building ten forts to mark and protect the west Texas frontier, situated from Eagle Pass to the confluence of the West Fork and Clear Fork of the Trinity River. Worth died on 7 May 1849 from cholera. General William S. Harney was assigned to Worth's position. He ordered Major Ripley A. ArnoldCrimmins, M.L., 1943, \\"The First Line of Army Posts Established in West Texas in 1849,\\" Abilene: West Texas Historical Association, Vol. XIX, pp. 121‚Äì127 to find a new fort site near the confluence of the West and Clear Forks. On 6 June 1849, Arnold established a post on the banks of the Trinity and named it Camp Worth in honor of the late General Worth. In August 1849, Arnold moved the camp to a north-facing bluff that overlooked the mouth of the Clear Fork. The US War Department officially granted the name \\"Fort Worth\\" to the post on 14 November 1849. Development of the town Although Native Americans were still attempting to defend and maintain their traditional territory, European-American pioneers quickly settled near the fort. In the process of relocating the camp to the bluff, Arnold found George \\"Press\\" Farmer living there and allowed him to open the first sutler's store. Other early settlers were Howard W. Peak, Ed Terrell, George W. Terrell, and Ephraim M. Daggett. When a new line of forts was built further west, the U.S. Army evacuated Fort Worth on 17 September 1853. The settlers decided to take possession of the fort site. John Peter Smith opened a school in 1854 to twelve students; Archibald Leonard and Henry Daggett started the first department stores. Julian Feild opened a flour mill and general store in 1856, and the Butterfield Overland Mail and the Southern Pacific Stage Line used the town as their western terminus on the westward journey to California. In 1855, a battle over the placement of the county seat erupted. Since 1849 the county seat had been Birdville, but in 1855 Fort Worth citizens decided that they wanted to claim the county seat. After a long fight, Fort Worth gained the title in 1860 and construction began on a stone county courthouse. After a delay due to the Civil War, the courthouse was completed in the 1870s. Fort Worth settlers held slaves in its antebellum period. In 1860, Tarrant County had 5,170 whites and 850 slaves. When the question came to secede from the Union, most citizens were for secession, and Tarrant County voted for it. The effects of the Civil War and Reconstruction nearly wiped Fort Worth off the map during the 1860s. The city's population dropped as low as 175 and food, supply, and money shortages burdened the citizens. As the War's effects began to fade, so did the city's hardships. It gradually began to revive in the 1870s. By 1872, William C. Boaz, William Henry Davis, and Jacob Samuels opened general stores. In 1873, Khleber M. Van Zandt established Tidball, Van Zandt, and Company, which became the Fort Worth National Bank in 1884. Barrooms such as Tom Prindle's Saloon and Steele's Tavern welcomed many travelers. In 1876, future Denver, Colorado crime boss, Soapy Smith arrived in Fort Worth and began his criminal career, operating his famous soap sell confidence tricks on the unwary. Weekly newspapers included the Fort Worth Chief and the Democrat. Schools reopened gradually after the war. In 1869 Randolph, Addison, and Ida Clark taught six students in a local church. The cattle industry was key to producing the economic boom years of Fort Worth and its association as \\"Cowtown.\\" Fort Worth was a good resting point for cowboys driving their cattle to Abilene, Kansas. As many northern cattle buyers established headquarters in Fort Worth, new businesses set up in the city, including Pendery and Wilson's Liquor Wholesale, B. C. Evans dry goods, and Martin B. Loyd's Exchange Office. In 1873 Fort Worth was incorporated with a mayor-council government, and W. P. Burts was elected as the city's first mayor. Panther City Map ‚Äì showing ‚Äì the Geographical location of Fort-Worth, Tex., and Rail-Roads, 1888 In 1875, the Dallas Herald published an article by a former Fort Worth lawyer, Robert E. Cowart, noting the drop in population due to the Panic of 1873 and harsh winter, had dealt a severe blow to the cattle industry. The railroad company had stopped laying track outside of Fort Worth, and Cowart said the city was so torpid that he saw a panther asleep in the street outside the courthouse. Although an intended insult, the nickname Panther City was embraced by residents as Fort Worth recovered the next year from the depression. In 1876, the Texas and Pacific Railway arrived in Fort Worth, causing a boom and transforming the Fort Worth Stockyards into a premier cattle industry center of wholesale trade. The arrival of the railroad ushered in an era of tremendous growth, as migrants from other areas of the war-torn South continued to swell the population. Newly dubbed the \\"Queen City of the Prairies\\", Fort Worth supplied a regional market via the growing transportation market. 20th century Texas and Pacific Railway yard in Fort Worth, 1916 New industries In 1902 the Swift and Armour meat packing companies set up facilities in Fort Worth. Their arrival meant employment for thousands of workers, greatly increasing the prosperity of the town. As a result, the town's population tripled in size from 26,600 people to more than 73,000, and it attracted migrants from rural areas, as well as immigrants. Texas had a segregated society, and often excluded blacks from the better jobs in new industries such as meat packing. The Fort Worth Gas Company was created in 1909 and began serving almost 4,000 customers via a pipeline from Petrolia, Texas. W.K. Gordon, superintendent of the Texas Pacific Coal Company, believed there was oil in the town of Ranger, away from Fort Worth. While he was testing for oil, a message came in from the headquarters in New York, saying, \\"Believe had made mistake, suggest you stop drilling\\". In October 1917, after Gordon had convinced the president to let him drill a little deeper, he struck a large oil deposit, transforming Ranger into a boom town of 30,000. Oil was also discovered in the towns of Desdemona, Breckenridge, and Burkburnett. Fort Worth was strategically located between these towns, which stimulated its economy. Even before the oil boom, the city had three oil refineries. By the summer of 1920, five more had been built, with four more under construction. The First World War In 1917, the Canadian government established three airfields, named Taliaferro 1, 2, and 3. When the United States entered World War I, the fields were taken over by the U.S. military, with two of them being renamed Carruthers Field and Barron Field. Camp Bowie was built in 1917 on at a cost of US$3,000,000. Over 5,000 people worked on it, constructing over 1,500 buildings. Named for Jim Bowie, it is home to the 36th Infantry Division. After the war, it became a demobilization center, preparing soldiers for entry into civilian life before it closed on August 15, 1919. Inter-war Period In 1916, construction on Lake Worth (Texas) was completed at a cost of US$1,000,000. It initially had a capacity of 21,800 acre-feet, but this was later increased to 33,600 acre- feet.https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rol87 A group of entrepreneurs noticed that people often went to the beach for entertainment. They built a boardwalk, bathhouse, rides, and a ballroom, which came to be known as Casino Park. In 1918, George E. Kessler oversaw construction of a new, nine-mile long street that went through the Arlington Heights neighborhood. Originally named Arlington Heights Boulevard, it was renamed Camp Bowie Boulevard in 1919, in honor of the soldiers trained in Fort Worth who fought in World War I. The camp's commanding officer supervised the planting of over 700 trees, the first of many beautification projects in Fort Worth. In 1919, Norton Hinckley and David Tandy founded the Hinckley-Tandy Leather Company, which made leather shoe parts to sell to shoe stores. It was turned into a leather craft company by Charles D. Tandy when shoe rationing during World War II nearly bankrupted the business. The company grew, and in 1963 they bought RadioShack, an electronics store based in Boston. They were a competitor for larger electronics companies such as Commodore International, Apple Inc., and Microsoft. In 2000, Tandy Corporation officially became the RadioShack Corporation. During the summer of 1936, the Casa Ma√±ana was built by Amon G. Carter, founder of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, as an amphitheater with the world's largest rotating stage. The theater produced Wild West shows and musicals for several years, but its high overhead and a drop in attendance, as people's attention was diverted to the impending wars, caused it to shut down. The building was later scrapped for the war effort. A smaller Casa Ma√±ana was rebuilt in 1958, thanks to a bond election and the support of the City Council. It is one of Fort Worth's well-known monuments. World War II In 1941, the U.S. Army established the Fort Worth Army Airfield as a heavy bomber training school. In 1948, it was renamed Carswell Air Force Base.

Fort Harker was built to defend a strategic position captured by Union troops in northeastern Alabama. Situated atop a hill east of the town of Stevenson, it was constructed in the summer of 1862 by soldiers and freed slaves of the Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Union General William Rosecrans. Stevenson was located at the junction for the Memphis and Charleston Railroad and the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. The location of the fort placed it within firing range of the town, railroads, supply depots, and warehouses.Stevenson Railroad Depot Museum (2006). Fort Harker. Retrieved August 10, 2006. In addition to Fort Harker, the Union Army established a hospital and a refugee camp in the town. The Union position would prevent Confederate troops from using the railroads in the defense of Chattanooga and secure critical supply lines for the Army of the Cumberland. The design of the fort is typical of many built during the American Civil War. The fort was constructed as a square earthen redoubt, on a side. The walls were constructed of rammed earth high, surrounded by a deep dry moat. The fort was armed with seven barbettes for heavy cannon, and a bomb-proof powder magazine.Payette, Pete (2006). Northern Alabama. Retrieved August 10, 2006. Access to the fort was by draw bridge across the moat. An eight-sided wooden blockhouse was situated at the center of the redoubt. General William Rosencrans General Rosecrans established his headquarters at Fort Harker in July, 1863, from where he directed a successful campaign against the position of Confederate General Braxton Bragg and the Army of Tennessee in Chattanooga, Tennessee. After the decisive defeat of the Confederate Army, Rosecrans failed to vigorously pursue his enemy. Bragg and his troops retreated in an orderly fashion southeast into Georgia, where Rosecrans and Bragg would meet again in the Battle of Chickamauga.Golden, Randy and Col. Taylor, Samuel (2006). \\"Chickamauga: Prelude, December, 1862 - September, 1863\\". Our Georgia History. Retrieved August 10, 2006. The Union army at Chickamauga was soundly defeated and all but routed, forcing Rosecrans and his men to retreat back to Chattanooga. Besieged by Confederate troops, Rosecrans was relieved of his command by General Ulysses S. Grant, who placed General George H. Thomas in command. The Battle of Chattanooga began on November 24, 1863, and the Union victory would secure southeastern Tennessee and northeastern Alabama, including Fort Harker, for the duration of the war. Fort Harker was abandoned at the end of the American Civil War. It fell into disrepair, and was used by local residents for agricultural purposes, including gardens and hog farming. Excavation of the site for historical preservation began in 1976. Restoration of the site for public access began in 1985. Repairs to the fort addressed damage cause by mountain bike riders and the use of the fort walls for target practice by the Stevenson Police Department.

The novel features the Motswana protagonist Mma Precious Ramotswe. Her fianc√© is struck down by depression, so Mma Ramotswe ensures he gets medical treatment and then appoints her secretary, Mma Makutsi, as acting manager of the garage. They had already decided to move the detective agency to office space in the garage, to cut expenses. Two cases are resolved, one by Mma Ramotswe and the other by Mma Makutsi, all on her own, as she manages the garage as well. Both women have opportunities to reflect on morality in modern Botswana. A boy with a strange history is brought to the orphan farm; Mr JLB Matekoni reaches out to him, teaching him language and making toys for him. The novel was reviewed by the New York Times when this and the two prior novels were published in the US at once in 2002. The reviewer finds the writing to have \\"energy and eccentricity\\" but with \\"formal cadences [that] can sometimes slide into a languid drone\\". The author writes \\"about the variety and resilience of a nation to which Smith seems utterly devoted.\\" The main character \\"Mma Ramotswe acts as much like Miss Manners as Miss Marple.\\" Other reviews note that Mma Ramotswe is \\"a remarkably original character\\" and that McCall Smith's writing style is deceptively simple and direct, marked by \\"passages that have the power to amuse or shock or touch the heart, sometimes all at once\\". A review of the audio books in the US noted Mma Ramotswe's solutions of mysteries through her \\"finely honed sense of human frailty and simple wisdom\\" and finds the audio version is especially good for readers of this novel, as the accent on English from Botswana is unique. Plot summary Mma Ramotswe's business, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has clients but needs to cut costs and increase revenue from fees. To reduce costs, she and her fianc√© Mr JLB Matekoni decide to move the agency to the garage, which has plenty of office space. The original office will in turn be let, to add income. Mma Makutsi, secretary, is given the title of assistant detective, with a rise in pay. Mr JLB Matekoni is behind on his paperwork, which Mma Makutsi can organize. He has been lethargic lately. Mma Ramotswe realizes he needs help, and sets out to help him. He will not agree to see the doctor, so Mma Ramotswe asks Mma Potokwane of the orphan farm to step in. Mma Potokwane brings him to Dr Moffat who diagnoses him as having depression, for which he steps back from his garage while medications begin to work. Mma Makutsi takes over management of the garage and the useless young apprentices, making the apprentices accountable for their work, and making rapid business decisions to make good on the garage's name, Speedy Motors. She shows her strong management skills from the first hour of taking over her role as acting manager. The young apprentices are impressed with her, and how she applies her detective skills to solving some of the auto problems that the apprentices cannot solve. An important Government Man, never named, approaches Mma Ramotswe to investigate his sister-in-law, whom he suspects of attempting to poison his brother. Mma Makutsi devises a way to gain access to the family, so the case is accepted, despite Mma Ramotswe needing time for her fianc√© and their foster children. Mma Ramotswe is invited to stay at the family farm, so she can meet the family and investigate. While she is away, Mma Makutsi gains a client for the detective agency who wants work done in three days. Mr Pulani runs the beauty contests in Gaborone. The present contest for Miss Beauty and Integrity has five finalists; one is disqualified for theft from a store. The final selection is in three days. He wants to know if there is one finalist who has integrity. He is already under pressure from his financial backers for scandals the year before. He promises a large fee, writing the check as soon as Mma Makutsi agrees to take the case. She travels to the university campus where one contestant lives, under her guise as a news reporter come to interview each contestant. The girl reveals herself to be shallow, a \\"bad girl\\". One of the apprentices drives her to meet the girls; Mma Makutsi realizes that any girls he knows will not be suitable to win the contest. He knows three of the four girls from his bar visits. Mma Makutsi then proceeds to the home of the fourth girl. She proves to be beautiful and modest, and her goal is to attend the Botswana Secretarial College, the same as Mma Makutsi attended. Returning to the office, she reports to the client with confidence that she is the contestant who matches the title of the contest. At the farm, Mma Ramotswe meets all the family of the Government Man and a few of the staff in the house. She joins the family for a lunch that includes a meat stew. She is poisoned by this meal, as are several others in the family. She recovers and sleeps, waking well before dawn. Walking about the grounds, she encounters the cook, who is starting the fire in the house boiler. He once had worked in Gaborone as an assistant chef, but really did not like the work. He met the Government Man, who suggested he go to the family farm to be the assistant manager, as that was the work he sought, care of the cattle. Arriving at the farm, the brother took him on as the chef based on his experience. The cook had no success in making his case for a different job, so he began cooking badly in hopes they would push him out of that job. Mma Ramotswe decides not to prosecute the cook for the risks he had taken. Back in Gaborone she confronts the Government Man with all the misunderstandings and hurt feelings of each person in that family, the real poison of so many secrets and unexpressed feelings. All of this is out in the open now and the cook is put to a different job. She then goes to see her fianc√© at the orphan farm, where he has been connecting with the wild boy, teaching him words, making him toys. The two reach a vantage point above Mochudi, to see how the rains change the landscape. He is getting better.

Mma Potokwane gave him a name, and tries to reach him. He bites, like a wild boy, and the first people who found him said he smelled like a lion. Mma Ramotswe meets him early on, and Mr JLB Matekoni connects with him toward the end of the novel. *Mr Moemedi ‚ÄúTwo Shots‚Äù Pulani: Businessman of Gaborone who loves to look at beautiful women, and runs beauty contests in Botswana. He seeks help from the Detective Agency, because one of the five finalists for Miss Beauty and Integrity has been caught stealing. *Motlamedi: Finalist in the Miss Beauty and Integrity contest who is attending university, but is a \\"good time girl\\" known to the garage apprentice, and in Mma Makutsi's view, a \\"bad girl\\". *Patricia: Finalist in the Miss Beauty and Integrity contest who lives in Tlokweng with her mother. She hopes to attend the Botswana Secretarial College. Mma Makutsi judges her as having integrity. Reviews All of the first three books in this series are reviewed in one article by Alida Becker. Regarding the main character with her \\"appealing personality,\\" she says, \\"As she pursues her investigations . . . Mma Ramotswe acts as much like Miss Manners as Miss Marple.\\" Once the reader has read the first two novels and is \\"in the third, Morality for Beautiful Girls, you've realized that all this activity is much less about whodunit than why.\\" The novels are also \\"about the variety and resilience of a nation to which Smith seems utterly devoted.\\" The writing has both \\"energy and eccentricity\\", though \\"occasional longeurs of Smith's prose, whose formal cadences can sometimes slide into a languid drone\\" also mark the prose. As an example of the charm of Mma Ramotswe, this extract from Morality of Beautiful Girls is described: \\"Listening to a BBC broadcast about philosophers, for example, she is startled, then amused, by a description that sounds very much like her selfish, abusive ex-husband: She had been married to an existentialist herself, without even knowing it.\\" In an article reviewing the first three novels of this series, Dick Lochte remarks on the events of Morality for Beautiful Girls as \\"thoroughly engaging and entertaining\\". The detective, Mma Ramotswe is \\"a remarkably original character\\". McCall Smith's writing style is \\"seemingly simple and direct, but this is a deception. Precious' progress is charted in passages that have the power to amuse or shock or touch the heart, sometimes all at once.\\" Sandy Bauers reviews the audio versions of the first four novels (The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Tears of the Giraffe, Morality for Beautiful Girls and The Kalahari Typing School for Men), which were released in 2003 in the US. The stories are \\"gentle mysteries, and Precious solves them all cleverly and easily, mostly through a finely honed sense of human frailty and simple wisdom.\\" The key aspect of these mysteries is not in the crimes themselves, rather \\"in the way she [Mma Ramotswe] does it, and the way the characters interact.\\" The reader for the audio versions is Lisette Lecat, who is familiar with Botswana's speech patterns in English. The reviewer feels that \\"books that require accents from other countries\\" are where the genre of audio books shines. Part of series This novel is the third in a series based on a set of characters residing in Botswana. The story opens about a month after the close of the prior novel, Tears of the Giraffe. The characters have aged and developed since the first novel, and more cases are brought to the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency to be solved in each novel. This novel has a balance between two cases and the personal lives of the main characters. There is a theme of morality, as Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi each spend time reflecting on moral behavior in the new nation, the differences in how men and women are treated, their strength from the old Setswana morality, and how people in the country change to meet the new situations of Botswana. Publication history Per Kirkus Reviews, the early novels in this series had their American publication later than in Scotland, part of the UK, which published the first in 1998, the second in 2000, and the third, Morality for Beautiful Girls, in 2001. The first three novels appeared in 2002 in the USA. In their review of the first novel in the series, Kirkus Reviews notes that \\"The first American publication of this 1999 debut has been preceded by two special Booker citations and two sequels, Tears of the Giraffe (2000) and Morality for Beautiful Girls (2001), both forthcoming in the series.\\" In reviewing the fifth novel in the series, Marcel Berlins describes the pathway of the growing audience, requiring one to understand that although Scotland and England are part of the same nation, the residents are not reading the same books at the same time. There was an interesting pathway for knowledge and appreciation of the series by McCall Smith, a Scot, featuring Precious Ramotswe, the female detective in Botswana, to reach England. Marcel Berlins notes in his review of The Full Cupboard of Life that it is the fifth in a series, but the first to be readily available in England, via the success of the series in America. \\"This novel by an eminent Scottish law professor about a woman detective in Botswana is the fifth in a series, the other four having largely escaped English attention (and availability). The Scots have had better luck: they've known about McCall Smith for several years, but it has taken his extraordinary and unexpected success in the US for word to have filtered back to England that he's a treasure of a writer whose books deserve immediate devouring.\\" In an item from the Wisconsin Public Radio program, To the Best of Our Knowledge, the first novel \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, was a surprise hit [in Scotland], receiving two special Booker citations and a place on the Times Literary Supplement's International Books of the Year and the Millennium list.\\" The success in Scotland and the favorable critical notice did not speed publishers to release it in the USA. \\"American publishers were slow to take an interest, and by the time The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency was picked up by Pantheon Books, Smith had already written two sequels. The books went from underground hits to national phenomena in the United States, spawning fan clubs and inspiring celebratory reviews.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Reading Group Guides for Morality for Beautiful Girls 2001 British novels The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency Novels by Alexander McCall Smith ","title":"Morality for Beautiful Girls"},{"id":"6374932","text":"Trinacromerum is an extinct genus of sauropterygian reptile, a member of the polycotylid plesiosaurs.

It was acquired by Roche in 2007 and shut down by Roche in 2013 when its technology became noncompetitive, although production continued until mid-2016. History 454 Life Sciences was founded by Jonathan Rothberg and was originally known as 454 Corporation, a subsidiary of CuraGen. For their method for low-cost gene sequencing, 454 Life Sciences was awarded the Wall Street Journal's Gold Medal for Innovation in the Biotech-Medical category in 2005. The name 454 was the code name by which the project was referred to at CuraGen, and the numbers have no known special meaning. In November 2006, Rothberg, Michael Egholm, and colleagues at 454 published a cover article with Svante P√§√§bo in Nature describing the first million base pairs of the Neanderthal genome, and initiated the Neanderthal Genome Project to complete the sequence of the Neanderthal genome by 2009. In late March 2007, Roche Diagnostics acquired 454 Life Sciences for US$154.9 million. It remained a separate business unit. In October 2013, Roche announced that it would shut down 454, and stop supporting the platform by mid-2016. In May 2007, 454 published the results of Project \\"Jim\\": the sequencing of the genome of James Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA. Technology 454 Sequencing used a large-scale parallel pyrosequencing system capable of sequencing roughly 400-600 megabases of DNA per 10-hour run on the Genome Sequencer FLX with GS FLX Titanium series reagents. The system relied on fixing nebulized and adapter-ligated DNA fragments to small DNA-capture beads in a water-in-oil emulsion. The DNA fixed to these beads was then amplified by PCR. Each DNA-bound bead was placed into a ~29 Œºm well on a PicoTiterPlate, a fiber optic chip. A mix of enzymes such as DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, and luciferase was also packed into the well. The PicoTiterPlate was then placed into the GS FLX System for sequencing. 454 released the GS20 sequencing machine in 2005, the first next- generation DNA sequencer on the market. In 2008, 454 Sequencing launched the GS FLX Titanium series reagents for use on the Genome Sequencer FLX instrument, with the ability to sequence 400-600 million base pairs per run with 400-500 base pair read lengths. In late 2009, 454 Life Sciences introduced the GS Junior System, a bench top version of the Genome Sequencer FLX System. DNA library preparation and emPCR Genomic DNA was fractionated into smaller fragments (300-800 base pairs) and polished (made blunt at each end). Short adaptors were then ligated onto the ends of the fragments. These adaptors provided priming sequences for both amplification and sequencing of the sample-library fragments. One adaptor (Adaptor B) contained a 5'-biotin tag for immobilization of the DNA library onto streptavidin-coated beads. After nick repair, the non-biotinylated strand was released and used as a single-stranded template DNA (sstDNA) library. The sstDNA library was assessed for its quality and the optimal amount (DNA copies per bead) needed for emPCR is determined by titration. The sstDNA library was immobilized onto beads. The beads containing a library fragment carried a single sstDNA molecule. The bead-bound library was emulsified with the amplification reagents in a water-in-oil mixture. Each bead was captured within its own microreactor where PCR amplification occurs. This resulted in bead-immobilized, clonally amplified DNA fragments. Sequencing Single- stranded template DNA library beads were added to the DNA Bead Incubation Mix (containing DNA polymerase) and were layered with Enzyme Beads (containing sulfurylase and luciferase) onto a PicoTiterPlate device. The device was centrifuged to deposit the beads into the wells. The layer of Enzyme Beads ensured that the DNA beads remained positioned in the wells during the sequencing reaction. The bead-deposition process was designed to maximize the number of wells that contain a single amplified library bead. The loaded PicoTiterPlate device were placed into the Genome Sequencer FLX Instrument. The fluidics sub-system delivered sequencing reagents (containing buffers and nucleotides) across the wells of the plate. The four DNA nucleotides were added sequentially in a fixed order across the PicoTiterPlate device during a sequencing run. During the nucleotide flow, millions of copies of DNA bound to each of the beads were sequenced in parallel. When a nucleotide complementary to the template strand was added into a well, the polymerase extended the existing DNA strand by adding nucleotide(s). Addition of one (or more) nucleotide(s) generated a light signal that was recorded by the CCD camera in the instrument. This technique was based on sequencing-by-synthesis and called pyrosequencing. The signal strength was proportional to the number of nucleotides; for example, homopolymer stretches, incorporated in a single nucleotide flow generated a greater signal than single nucleotides. However, the signal strength for homopolymer stretches was linear only up to eight consecutive nucleotides after which the signal fell off rapidly. Data were stored in standard flowgram format (SFF) files for downstream analysis.

Location Central Pier, Blackpool (Feb. 2006) (South Pier is in distance) The pier is central in that it is located between the other two, but it was close to the site of the now-defunct Blackpool Central railway station about 550 yards south of Blackpool Tower. Since the coastline is very straight and flat, the pier simply extends at right angles to the sea front, roughly level with the promenade. History The success of the North Pier prompted the formation of the Blackpool South Jetty Company one year later in 1864. Impressed with the construction of Blackpool Pier (North Pier), the company hired the same contractor, Richard Laidlaw and Son of Glasgow for the project. This time, however, the company used the designs of Lieutenant- Colonel John Isaac Mawson rather than those of Eugenius Birch. When the pier was opened on 30 May 1868, it was 503 yards in length, 131 yards of which was a landing jetty for use at low tide. The first manager of the pier was Robert Bickerstaffe, coxswain of the first Blackpool lifeboat. Blackpool's lifeboat station is located next to Central Pier. The facade of the pier in July 2011. From the start, the new pier's emphasis was on fun rather than the genteel relaxation provided at North Pier. In the early days fun was provided mainly by dancing facilities, but in the 20th century, roller skating was introduced along with fairground rides and amusement machines. Steamboat excursions departed from the landing jetty as they did from North Pier. The dance halls became less popular after the Second World War and the facilities were adapted into a theatre, bars and amusement arcades by the 1970s. The pierhead theatre was modernised in 1986 and became known as \\"Peggy Sue's Showboat\\". A striking addition came in 1990 when a Ferris wheel was erected, a half-scale reference to the Victorian attraction that had been part of the Winter Gardens complex a century earlier. The pier is now known as South Pier was built 30 years later. On the 17th of July 2020, in the early hours of 3:00 am BST a fire broke out on the central pier. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-53441236 Construction and adaptation Central Pier is constructed mostly of cast iron with wooden decking. The piles on which the structure rests were driven using the screw pile method pioneered by Eugenius Birch. This involved twisting screw-tipped cast iron piles down through the sand until they hit bedrock. The materials and building techniques were similar to those used for North Pier but the structure of Central is a little more delicate in appearance. The pier has suffered relatively little damage save for fires in 1964 and 1973 which gutted the theatre buildings. The main structural alterations have been the removal of the obsolete 131 yards (120 m) low tide jetty in 1975 and the construction of the Ferris wheel in 1990. The addition of the wheel required the midsection of the pier to be strengthened to cope with the extra weight.The Central Pier also caught fire in 2020 which upset everyone.

She served as a commissioned ship for 15 months. Hydrus (AKA-28) was launched under Maritime Commission contract by Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc., Providence, R.I., 28 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Alexander Hylek; and commissioned 9 December, Lt. Comdr. R. J. Wissinger in command. Service history=1944 Hydrus departed Providence 22 December for Hampton Roads and her shakedown training, completing this phase of her operations early in January 1945. The attack transport got underway 7 January for the Pacific theater, sailing via the Canal Zone to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 27 January. 1945 With the island campaign in the Pacific then entering its final phases, Hydrus sailed 1 February for Guadalcanal to participate in the extensive training operations for the projected invasion of Okinawa, the last objective before the mainland itself. Arriving 11 February, she took part in practice landings on Guadalcanal until 15 March, when her group, Task Force 53, sailed for the final staging area, Ulithi. The period after her arrival 21-26 March, was spent in final preparations for the giant invasion, and 27 March found Hydrus and other transports of Task Force 53 steaming toward Okinawa with Marines and their equipment. They arrived off the beaches 1 April and under the command of Vice Adm. Kelly Turner carried out the successful assault. Hydrus discharged her troops and equipment off the Hagushi beaches. Between 1-9 April the ship remained off the bitterly contested island, often undergoing heavy air attack. She departed 10 April for Guam and Pearl Harbor, arriving in Hawaii 26 April 1945. Hydrus got underway 5 May for the United States, and arrived San Francisco six days later. After loading fresh cargo she once again sailed for Pearl Harbor, arriving 26 May. The next two months saw Hydrus operate temporarily as an inter-island cargo carrier, transporting supplies of various types among the myriad islands in the Hawaiian chain. After brief repairs, she sailed with a cargo for Christmas Island and Canton Island, but returned to Honolulu 3 August. Slated for return to the western Pacific, Hydrus sailed 7 August for Ulithi and Okinawa. During this passage she received word of the war's end, and arrived Okinawa to unload her cargo 3 September. Except for 16-18 September, when she got underway to ride out the great typhoon, Hydrus remained at anchor off Okinawa until 25 September. She then sailed to Manus to embark units of a Marine Air Group for the occupation of the Chinese mainland. The transport arrived Tsingtao 17 October to put ashore her cargo and passengers, thus helping to speed the occupation and help stabilize the explosive internal situation in China. She subsequently embarked additional troops in the Philippines and carried them to Taku, China, 14 November. Her role in the Chinese occupation over, Hydrus was assigned duty with \\"Magic Carpet\\", the gigantic operation for the return of Pacific veterans. She sailed from Shanghai 6 December and arrived Seattle 23 December. Post-war Designated for return to the Maritime Commission, the ship sailed 11 January for the East Coast and arrived New York 2 February. There Hydrus was selected as a training ship for the New York State Maritime Academy, and steamed up the East River to Fort Schuyler 6 March 1946. She decommissioned there 26 March and became Empire State II. After a 10-year career as a training ship for future maritime officers, the ship was placed in the Maritime Commission's National Defense Reserve Fleet in June 1956. She remained there until being sold in April 1964 to Union Minerals & Alloys Corp., of New York, and scrapped. Hydrus received one battle star for World War II service.

During the late 1920s, Princeton Seminary was embroiled in the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy that had disquieted the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America as well as other Protestant denominations. McIntire became a strong supporter of J. Gresham Machen, a conservative professor of New Testament. With Machen, McIntire opposed a reorganization of the seminary in 1929 that appeared to strengthen liberal elements in the church. He followed his mentor and three other professors from Princeton to the newly founded Westminster Theological Seminary, where he completed his Th.B. degree in 1931.Margaret G. Harden, comp.,A Brief History of the Bible Presbyterian Church and Its Agencies (privately published, 1966). McIntire said that Machen's book What Is Faith? influenced him \\"as much as any book.\\" [Carl McIntire], \\"Who Is Carl McIntire?\\" booklet published by the 20th Century Reformation Hour [1968], 2. In May 1931, he married Fairy Eunice Davis of Paris, Texas, whom he had met when they were both students at Southeastern,McIntire called Fairy David McIntire (December 23, 1906 - September 13, 1992), a \\"person of unusual ability and charm [who] stood beside him through all the trials.\\" [Carl McIntire], \\"Who Is Carl McIntire?\\" booklet published by the 20th Century Reformation Hour [1968], 2. and who became a high school English teacher while he completed seminary.

(Hotchkin Genealogy ) After the death of Fairy Davis McIntire in 1992, McIntire married Alice Goff, a church office administrator with whom he had worked for many years.The McIntire Memorial, 53. Founding of the Bible Presbyterian Church In 1931, McIntire was ordained into the ministry of the Presbyterian Church USA, serving for two years at Chelsea Presbyterian Church, Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1933, he was called to the Presbyterian Church of Collingswood, New Jersey, near Philadelphia, the largest church in the West Jersey Presbytery. McIntire remained a resident of Collingswood for the rest of his life.The New York Times obituary, March 22, 2002. \\"His daughter Marianna Clark said he had lived in the same house in Collingswood, N.J., since 1939.\\" The Women's Missionary Society of the Collingswood church called his attention to what they perceived as a modernist perspective in the missions study book, which had been promoted by the denomination's Board of Foreign Missions.[Carl McIntire], \\"Who Is Carl McIntire?\\" booklet published by the 20th Century Reformation Hour [1968], 3. McIntire joined the conservative side in the ongoing Fundamentalist-Modernist debate, and in 1934, at Machen's invitation, he became a founding member of the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions, an agency organized as an alternative to the denominational mission board that supported theologically liberal missionaries. Deeming the new board a challenge to its authority, the General Assembly demanded that the clergymen resign. After they refused, Machen, McIntire, and seven other clergymen were tried by an ecclesiastical court in 1935-36.Ethel Rink, 40 Years...Carl McIntire and the Bible Presbyterian Church of Collingswood, 1933-1973 (Collingswood, N.J.: Christian Beacon Press, 1973),8-10. The board members lost, and they renounced the jurisdiction of the Presbyterian Church, as did the Collingswood Presbyterian Church, only a tiny minority of whose members refused to support their young pastor.Margaret G. Harden, comp.,A Brief History of the Bible Presbyterian Church and Its Agencies(privately published, [1966]); see also A brief history of the Independent Board from the IBPFM website In 1936 McIntire joined Machen and others to found the Presbyterian Church of America, later renamed the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. The new church attracted supporters from other Reformed traditions, complicating the church's effort to define itself. A debate soon emerged in the young denomination over eschatology, Presbyterian traditions, the use of alcohol and tobacco, and the place of political activity in the church. McIntire and others left in 1937 to form the Bible Presbyterian Church, which emphasized Fundamentalist distinctives in contrast to continental Reformed positions, supporting political involvement, the Scofield Reference Bible, a premillennialist view of eschatology, and abstinence from the use of tobacco and alcohol.[Carl McIntire], \\"Who Is Carl McIntire?\\" booklet published by the 20th Century Reformation Hour [1968], 3; D. G. Hart, Defending the Faith: J. Gresham Machen and the Crisis of Conservative Protestantism in Modern America (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994), 163, 165, 166. In April 1938, after the Collingswood church lost a civil suit over control of its church property, the congregation walked out en masse from their impressive Gothic building and followed McIntire to a huge tent erected several blocks east on the main street at Haddon Avenue and Cuthbert Boulevard.Following the withdrawal, the denomination then deposed McIntire, allowing his enemies to brand him a \\"defrocked Presbyterian minister.\\" [Carl McIntire], \\"Who Is Carl McIntire?\\" booklet published by the 20th Century Reformation Hour [1968], 3. In May 1938, the congregation moved into a wooden \\"Tabernacle,\\" and in November 1957, into a neo-colonial church building with a tall, Wren steeple. The church seated more than a thousand. A Sunday School was constructed on the location of the previous tent, and the revamped Tabernacle became an activity center.The Bible Presbyterian Church of Collingswood: for the Glory of God (Collingswood BPC, 1957); Ethel Rink, 40 Years...Carl McIntire and the Bible Presbyterian Church of Collingswood, 1933-1973 (Collingswood, N.J.: Christian Beacon Press, 1973),24-26.

The Sunday School building was also used for Faith Christian School. Expanding ministry=Christian Beacon Logo of the Christian Beacon. In February 1936, during the series of ecclesiastical trials, McIntire launched a weekly newspaper, The Christian Beacon to give greater voice to his message. The Collingswood church had already printed many of his sermons, and its church services had been broadcast over the radio in the Philadelphia region. Over the next four decades, McIntire published twelve books, and hundreds of pamphlets, booklets, sermons, speeches, and documentary portfolios.Ethel Rink served as the editor of virtually all his major publications, and Ruth Trato assisted with the documentary supplements. After the death of Rink, McIntire's published prose noticeably deteriorated. As Joel Carpenter has written, McIntire was \\"a gifted publicist,\\" and his Christian Beacon was a \\"widely read organ of separatist opinion in which McIntire practiced his talent for sensational and aggressive religious journalism.\\"Joel A. Carpenter, Revive Us Again: The Reawakening of American Fundamentalism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), 205. Twentieth-Century Reformation Hour In March 1955, McIntire initiated a daily thirty-minute radio program, The Twentieth Century Reformation Hour, which featured McIntire's commentary on religious and political affairs.Ethel Rink, 40 Years, 24. The radio program generally began with a homily from the Bible, followed by a monologue by McIntire on a wide range of subjects, including apostasy in mainline churches, liberalism in government, opposition to coexistence with communism, and cultural issues of the moment, including gambling, sex education, socialized medicine, and fluoridation of the water. An associate pastor of the Collingswood church, Charles Richter, known to listeners as \\"Amen Charlie,\\" regularly \\"amened\\" his support of McIntire's statements.\\"Amen Charlie was Carl McIntire's radio sidekick when I frequently tuned in to the program during the 1960s and '70s. Charlie was a man of very few words. His main role was to provide a brief change of pace in the midst of his boss's monologues. McIntire would go on for a few minutes on favorite topic, and then he would pause and ask, 'Isn't that right, Charlie?' And Amen Charlie would reply, 'Amen. You're right, Dr. McIntire!'\\" Richard J. Mouw, \\"You're Right, Dr. McIntire,\\" Christianity Today, May 17, 2002. During the 1960s, the program may have been heard on as many as 600 radio stations‚Äîalthough McIntire's inaccuracy with numbers became legendary.D.A. Waite, Carl McIntire's $200,000 Tax Debt in Cape May, Etc., (Collingswood, N.J.: The Bible for Today, 1974). Waite was a disaffected former employee who counted 414 stations in April 1965. By the early 1970s, Waite said that McIntire was broadcasting on \\"well under 100 stations.\\" (8). In 1965, McIntire effectively purchased radio station, WXUR, Media, Pennsylvania, although it was formally owned by Faith Theological Seminary.Ethel Rink, 40 Years, 39. Bible conference centers McIntire's outreach included an interest in promoting summer Bible conferences, a common method of evangelization and Bible teaching among American Protestants during the early twentieth century.David O. Beale, In Pursuit of Purity: American Fundamentalism Since 1850 (Greenville, S.C.: Bob Jones University Press, 1986), 91-95. In 1941, McIntire took a leading role in acquiring and operating Harvey Cedars Bible Conference on the Jersey shore at Harvey Cedars, New Jersey (1941‚Äì56).[Ethel Rink], 40 Years...Carl McIntire and the Bible Presbyterian Church of Collingswood, 1933-1973 (Collingswood: Christian Beacon Press, 1973), 18; Harvey Cedars Bible Conference After the Bible Presbyterian denomination underwent its first split in the latter year, McIntire's organization purchased the historic Admiral Hotel in Cape May, New Jersey in 1962, and founded the Christian Admiral Bible Conference and Freedom Center. McIntire added a number of distressed properties to his holdings, becoming an unwitting preservationist as he prevented outmoded structures‚Äîthe most notable being the nineteenth-century Windsor and Congress Hall hotels‚Äîfrom being destroyed to make room for motels.Washington Times, June 1, 2007; Gladys Titzck Rhoads and Nancy Titzck Anderson, McIntire: Defender of Faith and Freedom (Xulon Press, 2011), 308. The conference itself contributed to the revival of Cape May as a summer resort. In 1971, McIntire also developed a Bible conference in Cape Canavaral, Florida.McIntire's non-profit corporation, Christian Beacon Press, Inc., owned the newspaper, the publishing house, the radio ministry, the Bible conferences, and other properties connected with the ministry, and McIntire's income was derived solely from his church salary. In 1939, McIntire and his wife purchased their own home facing Knight's Park in Collingswood, where McIntire lived until his death in 2002. Church councils Christian Admiral hotel, home to many Bible conferences, as well as ACCC and ICCC congresses. During the 1940s, McIntire's influence expanded throughout the United States and overseas. In 1941, he helped create the American Council of Christian Churches (ACCC) as a conservative alternative to the liberal Federal (later, National) Council of Churches (NCC). In 1948, he likewise helped to found the International Council of Christian Churches (ICCC) to challenge the World Council of Churches (WCC). McIntire was elected first President of the ICCC and was reelected at each World Congress until he died. He and his wife, Fairy, traveled around the world scores of times both to encourage evangelical Christians abroad and to demonstrate his opposition to the World Council of Churches. (During McIntire's long presidency, the headquarters of the ICCC were located in Amsterdam, and J. C. Maris served as General Secretary.)See The McIntire Memorial: Carl McIntire, 1906-2002, edited by K. C. Quek ([Singapore]: ICCC, 2005); see also Silver Jubilee 1948-1973: Celebrating the Silver Anniversary of the International Council of Christian Churches (ICCC, 1973). The ICCC published books collecting the sermons and addresses delivered on the themes of the plenary congresses. Titles indicated the emphases of each congress, including The Christ of the Scriptures (ICCC, 1958), and Jesus Christ the Same Yesterday, and Today, and For Ever (ICCC, 1962). The ICCC office has since moved to Singapore. During the late 1960s, McIntire's relationship with the ACCC leadership became strained, and he secretly transferred an ACCC relief agency (along with $62,000) to the ICCC, which remained firmly under his control. McIntire \\"was perennially late to ACCC meetings, and then he would demand that any decisions made in advance of his arrival be undone.\\" When ACCC leaders refused to accommodate him, he attacked them in the Christian Beacon, claiming that there was a \\"Baptist plot against him.\\" After being outmaneuvered, McIntire attempted a parliamentary takeover in October 1970, which eventually led to a court order against him in 1971, and a final severing of his relationship with the ACCC.Hendershot, What's Fair on the Air?, 115-18; Rhoads and Anderson, 397-403. Educational institutions McIntire promoted several educational ministries. The Sunday School and the Summer Bible School of the Collingswood church were large and active. (The Summer Bible School of the Collingswood church‚ÄîMcIntire disliked the term \\"Vacation Bible School\\"‚Äîran for four weeks rather than the typical one week of most churches during the period.) McIntire also gained control of the National Bible Institute in New York City and transformed the school into a liberal arts college, Shelton College, which moved to the \\"Skylands\\" estate in Ringwood, New Jersey, in 1953. In 1964, the college moved to Cape May, later to Cape Canaveral, Florida, and then back to Cape May before closing in the 1980s after the New Jersey Supreme Court in New Jersey Board of Higher Education v. Shelton College prohibited Shelton from granting academic degrees without a state license.See Russell Kirk, \\"Shelton College and State Licensing of Religious Schools: An Educator's View of the Interface Between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses,\\" Law & Contemporary Problems, 44:2 (Spring 1981), 169-184. \\"Skylands\\" became the New Jersey Botanical Gardens in 1984 New Jersey Botanical Gardens website. Faith Theological Seminary, organized in 1937 as an independent school associated with the Bible Presbyterian denomination, later occupied Lynnewood Hall, the Gilded Age estate of P.A.B. Widener in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.On Lynnewood Hall see Preservation Alliance News . The seminary later moved to much more plebeian quarters in Baltimore, Maryland.Faith Theological Seminary website. McIntire and west coast supporters of the Bible Presbyterian Church founded Highland College in Pasadena, California, a small Christian liberal arts college, and remained associated with the college until 1956. Christian emphases McIntire's Outside the Gate, where he lays out his separatist doctrine. McIntire considered himself to be first of all a pastor and preacher. His sermons were frequently exegetical, and he often proceeded systematically through particular books of the Bible. He urged his congregation to read the Bible through every year.Frank Mood, \\"'A Man Sent from God,'\\" in K. C. Quek, ed., The McIntire Memorial: Carl McIntire, 1906-2002(Singapore: ICCC, 2005), 112-115. For McIntire the term Fundamentalist included attachment to the fundamentals of the historic Christian religion as defined by the Westminster Confession of Faith, the doctrinal standard of the Presbyterian Church and by the Apostles Creed and Nicene Creed. He was a Calvinist who believed that John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion, the Westminster Confession, and the Shorter and Larger Westminster catechisms were the finest articulations of the Christian faith.The Constitution of the Bible Presbyterian Church, (Independent Board of Home Missions, various editions), which McIntire helped to prepare. McIntire emphasized the doctrine of separation, which he based on 2 Corinthians 6:17: \\"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.\\" To McIntire, separation emphasized the purity of the church in opposition to apostasy, the falling away from the historic Christian faith in which he believed theological liberals to be engaged.See especially McIntire, Twentieth Century Reformation (Collingswood: Christian Beacon Press, 1944) Like other fundamentalists of the period, McIntire also separated from evangelical groups, such as the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), which he believed had compromised with the liberalism of the National Council of Churches. He early rejected the Neo-evangelicalism of Billy Graham even before Graham's New York City Evangelistic Crusade of 1957, because Graham's organization had accepted the support of those McIntire regarded as liberals.Harden, 102. In the public eye Although his Oklahoma family had voted Democratic, McIntire eventually became a conservative Republican. Before and during World War II, McIntire opposed Nazi totalitarianism and anti- semitism, and afterwards he became a champion of anti-Communism and especially one who attacked Communist control of religion in the Soviet Union. McIntire argued that although America had once honored God and freedom, it was in danger of losing its heritage.Are World Events Today Fulfilling Bible Prophesy?\\" Christian Beacon (7 January 1937); \\"Pastors Oppose Oath to Hitler,\\" Christian Beacon (23 June 1938): 1. On his radio program, McIntire often repeated the slogan, \\"Freedom is everybody's business, your business, my business, the church's business, and a man who will not use his freedom to defend his freedom, does not deserve his freedom.\\"Morris McDonald, ed., Freedom is My Business (Independent Board for Presbyterian Home Missions, 1983), a book of quotations selected from McIntire's writings (1938-1983). McIntire attracted considerable public attention through his public demonstrations, early gaining a feel for gestures that attracted popular notice. For instance, in 1947, he unsuccessfully opposed a revised New Jersey state constitution in a radio address entitled, \\"The Governor's Kittens,\\" while he (more-or-less) held a cat and kittens before the microphone.Ethel Rink, 40 Years, 20-21. McIntire attended virtually every important meeting of the World Council of Churches wherever its meetings were held and usually mounted demonstrations with placards outside the meeting hall, calling attention to what he regarded as the WCC's religious apostasy or its collaboration with Russian clergy who he believed were KGB operatives.His activities in connection with the WCC are extensively detailed in the Christian Beacon, and in a series of documentary supplements that collected a large amount of materials relevant to the theme of the WCC and the Russian clergy. Beginning in 1967, McIntire engaged in a running battle with the Federal Communications Commission over the then-applicable \\"Fairness Doctrine,\\" by which radio stations had to provide varied political views to retain their licenses.Hendershot, What's Fair on the Air, 144. Hendershot suggests that McIntire was \\"obviously spoiling for a fight with the FCC over the Fairness Doctrine, a fight he expected to win because he was certain that the doctrine was unconstitutional. WXUR was \\"incompetently run and flagrantly disrespectful of FCC requirements,\\" but there was also \\"no doubt that the station was targeted because many members of the local Philadelphia community found speech expressed on WXUR offensive and therefore wanted it censored.\\"Hendershot, What's Fair on the Air, 161. When the FCC refused to renew the WXUR license (rejecting the recommendation of its own examiner)Hendershot, What's Fair on the Air, 156. and the station was forced off the air in 1973, McIntire demonstrated his theatrical flair by holding a \\"funeral\\" for the station (complete with coffin) while dressed as John Witherspoon, a Presbyterian pastor and signer of the Declaration of Independence.On McIntire's conflict with the FCC, see Heather Hendershot, \\"God's Angriest Man: Carl McIntire, Cold War Fundamentalism, and Right-Wing Broadcasting,\\" American Quarterly, 59 (June 2007), 373-96. During the 1980s fundamentalists and evangelicals became firmly ensconced in cable and satellite distribution technologies, which were beyond the purview of the Fairness Doctrine. The Reagan FCC urged Congress to eliminate the Doctrine altogether, and when the Democratic Congress retaliated by trying to elevate it into law, President Reagan vetoed the bill. Later threats to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine in 1993 failed after Rush Limbaugh called the attempt the \\"Hush Rush Law.\\" Hendershot, What's Fair on the Air, 167-69. After a supporter purchased for McIntire a World War II vintage wooden-hulled Navy minesweeper named Oceanic (which McIntire renamed Columbus), he tried to broadcast outside the three-mile limit near Cape May, calling the floating station \\"Radio Free America.\\"Don Jensen, \\"Radio Free America: A 'Red, Right and Blue' Political Pirate,\\" Monitoring Magazine (October 1988) reprinted @ CarlMcIntire.org The station began broadcasting at 12:22 PM Eastern Time on September 19, 1973,The station broadcast at 1160 kHz, using a 10,000 watt transmitter, 8.5 miles (13.6 km) off the New Jersey coast. \\"FTA Battles for Airwaves\\", Overthrow (March 1984), 18. but was only on the air for ten hours‚Äîthe ship began to smoke from the heat of the antenna feeder line, and the signal interfered with that of radio station WHLW in Lakewood, New Jersey which broadcast on a neighboring frequency of 1170 kHz. Nevertheless, the notion of a Christian pirate radio station off the United States caught the attention of the media.Larry Townsend, \\"Reverend Carl McIntire: A Pirate of God,\\" @ CarlMcIntire.org . \\"I became a very famous man out of that,\\" McIntire later recalled, \\"People stood along the coast to see me. It was a crazy thing to do, but it was dramatic.\\"Randall Balmer, \\"Fundamentalist with Flair,\\" Christianity Today (May 21, 2002). McIntire also gained the public eye in the early 1970s when he organized a half dozen pro-Vietnam War \\"Victory Marches\\" in Washington, D.C. The march of October 3, 1970 was supposed to have featured South Vietnamese vice-president Nguyen Cao Ky, but the Nixon administration ensured that Ky would not be present.Contemporary biographical news sketch; more details may be found in John Fea, \\"Carl McIntire: From Fundamentalist Presbyterian to Presbyterian Fundamentalist,\\" American Presbyterian 72:4 (Winter 1994), 264. \\"McIntire then convinced Mrs. Ky to stand in for her husband, but her airplane en route to the US was conveniently called back to Paris with 'engine trouble.'\\" Hendershot,What's Fair on the Air, 110. McIntire attributed the prosecution and conviction of Lt. William Calley on 22 charges related to war crimes at My Lai to \\"a no-win policy\\" of the U.S. government in Vietnam. More than once McIntire's sense of the dramatic passed over into the risible, as for instance, when he urged in 1971 that a full-scale version of the Temple of Jerusalem be constructed in FloridaBaton Rouge Morning Advocate, (October 2, 1971). or two decades later when he suggested that Noah's ark be rebuilt and perhaps refloated off his conference center in Cape May. \\"It would be a tourist attraction,\\" said McIntire of the latter, \\"and it would forever down these liberals.\\"Christian Beacon (February 18‚Äì25, 1993), 7. In 1970, when gay activists proposed \\"Stonewall Nation\\", the takeover of sparsely populated Alpine County, California, McIntire announced that he would counteract the plan by having his followers move to the area in trailers.Los Angeles Times, October 28, 1970, 9A; Donn Teal, The Gay Militants: How Gay Liberation Began in America, 1969-1971 (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1971), 296. Neither the activists nor McIntire did anything of the sort. Later life McIntire could combine gravitas with a populist appeal to what he called \\"the grass roots.\\"\\"Despite widespread criticism of McIntire for inaccuracy, exaggeration, and what sometimes seems to be deliberate distortion, his followers fanatically support him. When ministers in Warren, Ohio, during the winter of 1962-63 tried to secure a cancellation of his broadcasts because the program was creating ill will in the community, his loyal listeners turned out in sub- zero weather to a protest meeting. The audience, counted at 2,350, jammed Warren's Packard Music Hall. Hundreds came in chartered buses from communities across the state and from adjoining Pennsylvania. The stage was bedecked with fifty-nine flags (courtesy of the Sons of the American Revolution), and the program included hymns and patriotic songs and Scripture readings. McIntire himself was welcomed by Mayor Robert Dunstan, who told the people that the preacher, like Noah of old, was 'a man raised up by God in a time of travail.' The hall echoed with 'Amens!' and when he appealed for money for his radio broadcasts, McIntire collected over $4,000 in checks and pledges in addition to some very substantial cash offerings.\\" Arnold Forster and Benjamin R. Epstein, Danger on the Right (New York: Random House, 1964), excerpt from CarlMcIntire.org A gifted preacher when he chose to be, he seemed to prefer dabbling in politics to Bible exposition.In reminiscing about previous Bible Conferences at Bob Jones University, the chancellor, Bob Jones III, recalled a sermon by Carl McIntire was one of two he specifically remembered, \\"He preached a message on the crucifixion from Psalm 22, and you felt like you were at the foot of the cross. I always wondered why he didn't do more of that kind of preaching and less of the communism stuff.\\" Abigail Murphy, \\"Dr. Bob Comments on Bible Conference,\\" Accord [Office of Communications, BJU], 4. 8 (March 26, 2009), 4. A man who inspired listeners and easily raised money for his various ministries, McIntire had few trustworthy associates to manage the day-to-day activities of his ramshackle empire. Nor could he brook sharing power.George Marsden, Reforming Fundamentalism: Fuller Seminary and the New Evangelicalism (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1987), 49: \\"McIntire...was constitutionally unable to play any other role than chief.\\" McIntire never groomed a successor (his son early became a college professor in Toronto) and seemed to have a knack for choosing men of questionable ethics to manage the branches of his organization. In April 1965, McIntire threatened to resign his pulpit unless the session of his church continued in office as elder the manager of the Christian Admiral Hotel who had been accused of moral improprieties. D. A. Waite, \\"Carl McIntire's $200,000 Tax Debt in Cape May, Etc.,\\" (Collingswood, N.J.: The Bible for Today, 1974), 22. In the 1960s his long-time friend and fellow fundamentalist, Robert T. Ketcham, pleaded with McIntire to \\"be more gracious in his dealings with other Christians,\\" but McIntire instead used the Christian Beacon to attack members of the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches of which Ketcham was an influential leader.J. Murray Murdoch, Portrait of Obedience: The Biography of Robert T. Ketcham (Schaumburg, Illinois: Regular Baptist Press, 1979), 286-87. In 1971, all but two of the professors of Faith Seminary, including President Allan A. MacRae, left over McIntire's alleged suppression of academic freedom and \\"oppressive leadership style.\\"John Fea, \\"Carl McIntire: From Fundamentalist Presbyterian to Presbyterian Fundamentalist,\\" American Presbyterian 72:4 (Winter 1994), 265. McIntire refused to participate in fundamentalist organizations which he could not dominate, even those led by other separatist fundamentalists of the period such as Bob Jones, Jr., and Ian Paisley.Bob Jones, Jr., Cornbread and Caviar (Greenville, SC: Bob Jones University Press), 191-93. Jones was exasperated at McIntire's attitude especially since Jones had had BJU confer an honorary degree on McIntire. Nevertheless, McIntire often inspired good-natured respect from some of the religious liberals whom he regularly picketed through the years; and his rhetoric, although sometimes bombastic, was rarely personal.\\"His protests at the assemblies of the World Council of Churches were so common that at the 1991 meeting in Canberra, Australia, church leaders whom he had reviled for decades came out to his solitary picket and greeted him like an old friend: 'Hey, Carl, how ya doing?'\\" Randall Balmer, \\"Fundamentalist with Flair,\\" Christianity Today (May 21, 2002). By the early 1970s, McIntire's ministries were debt-ridden and began to collapse one by one.Los Angeles Times, December 1, 1974). In 1970, he owed the town of Cape May more than a half million dollars in back taxes.John Fea, \\"Carl McIntire: From Fundamentalist Presbyterian to Presbyterian Fundamentalist,\\" American Presbyterian 72:4 (Winter 1994), 264. The buildings he had accumulated were sold or destroyed. By the time he died, at age 95,McIntire was buried in Harleigh Cemetery, Camden, New Jersey. without a successor, virtually everything was gone.Joel Belz, \\"This Fight's Over: Lessons from a Fiery Fundamentalist,\\" World, (April 6, 2002), 5: \\"[N]early everyone who worked with Carl McIntire ended up disillusioned....His own family members increasingly distanced themselves from their father and grandfather.\\" Even the shadow that remained of the Bible Presbyterian Church of Collingswood finally forced his resignation in 1999, after he had served the congregation for sixty years.The former principal of now his defunct church school, told Randall Balmer, \\"Speaking from God's Word, there wasn't anyone who could touch him, but...he wasn't touching the needs within the church.\\" Randall Balmer, \\"Fundamentalist with Flair,\\" Christianity Today (May 21, 2002). In the words of Joel Belz, McIntire was \\"a classic example of a brilliant and winsome man who chose his battles badly. Unyielding on petty issues, he divided where division was both unnecessary and costly to the very causes he championed. Too often, he seemed to love the fight more than the very valid issues over which the fights raged.\\"Belz, 5. McIntire had repeatedly criticized Princeton Theological Seminary, an institution he had left in 1929, as a bastion of theological liberalism.Randall Balmer, \\"Fundamentalist with Flair,\\" Christianity Today (May 21, 2002): \\"Princeton Theological Seminary is gone,\\" he said ruefully. It's ecumenical.\\" Yet when Princeton honored him almost affectionately as a distinguished alumnus, McIntire responded to its overtures and donated his papers to the Seminary.Princeton described the Carl McIntire Papers as \\"the largest single donation of papers that have come to the Seminary since its founding in 1812.\\" Carl McIntire Papers Further reading *Markku Ruotsila, Fighting Fundamentalist: Carl McIntire and the Politicization of American Fundamentalism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2016). *Gladys Titzck Rhoads and Nancy Titzck Anderson, McIntire: Defender of Faith and Freedom (Xulon Press, 2012) . *CarlMcIntire.org, includes many primary and secondary sources about McIntire. *International Council of Christian Churches website. *K.

It is classified as part of the Mosasaurinae subfamily, alongside genera like Mosasaurus and Prognathodon. Clidastes is known from deposits ranging in age from the Coniacian to the early Campanian in the United States. Clidastes means \\"locked vertebrae\\", which originates from the Greek noun Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπŒ¥ŒØ, or kleid meaning key (akin to Latin claudere meaning to shut). This refers to how the vertebral processes allow the proximal heads of the vertebrae to interlock for stability and strength during swimming.

Plesiopedal mosasaurs, such as Dallasaurus or Tethysaurus were primitive and largely coastal, while later hydropedal mosasaurs were streamlined and well-adapted to marine life. mosasaurs, representing one of the first properly marine predatory forms alongside other early hydropedal genera like Tylosaurus and Platecarpus. It was likely an agile swimmer that preyed upon cephalopods, fish and other small vertebrates in shallow water.

Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 20: 181 The generic name refers to how the vertebral processes allow the proximal heads of the vertebrae to interlock for stability and strength during swimming. Even though the vertebrae lock together, the living animal would have still had a range of motion in the horizontal plane that is sufficient to allow for the high quality of swimming in shallow waters.Wright, K.

Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 8, 3, 343-34 Additionally the strengthening of the tail, and entire backbone, allowed for muscle attachments to help it swimming. It possessed a delicate and slim form with an expansion of the neural spines and chevrons near the tip of the tail and this enabled it to chase down the fastest of prey. Illustration of a Clidastes forelimb from The Osteology of the Reptiles by Samuel Wendell Williston (1925). Due to being a well- represented and well-studied genus, Russell (1967) could list a large range of unambiguous character states for the genus, including the following: \\"Premaxilla with or without small rostrum anterior to premaxillary teeth. Fourteen to eighteen teeth in maxilla. Prefrontal forms small portion of posterolateral border of external nares, broad triangular ala projects laterally from supraorbital wing. Prefrontal and postorbitofrontal widely separated above orbits. Lateral margins of frontal nearly straight and converge anteriorly, median dorsal ridge weak. Ventral process of postorbitofrontal to jugal confluent with broadly exposed dorsal surface of postorbitofrontal. No ventroposterior process on jugal. Parietal foramen small, located entirely within parietal. Margins of dorsal parietal surface parallel one another and cranial midline to posterior base of diverging suspensorial rami, forming narrow rectangular field medially on parietal. Squamosal sends abbreviated wing medially to contact ramus irom parietal. Otosphenoidal crest on prootic covers exit for cranial nerve VII laterally. Fourteen to sixteen teeth in pterygoid. Suprastapedial process of quadrate moderately large; tympanic ala very thick. Stapcdial pit elliptical in form. Sixteen-18 teeth in dentary. Small projection of dentary aritcrior to first dentary tooth. Medial wing Irom angular contacts or nearly contacts coronoid. Dorsal. edge of surangular very thin Iamina of bone rising anteriorly to position high on posterior surface of coronoid. Retroarticular process of articular triangular in outline with heavy dorsal crest. Mandibular teeth usually compressed, bicarinatc and with smooth enamel surfaces.\\" Russell noted that his diagnosis was exclusively based on C. propython and C. liodontus and might not necessarily apply to C. sternbergii (later referred to its own genus, Eonatator) or C. iguanavus.  Teeth and tooth replacement  Clidastes skull from The Osteology of the Reptiles by Samuel Wendell Williston (1925). Mosasaur teeth are of rather uniform morphology (with a few exceptions, such as in Globidens) with a pointed and curved tooth crown that sits on a pedicel composed of bone.Olivier, R., & Maureen, K. (December 01, 2005). Tooth Replacement in the Late Cretaceous Mosasaur Clidastes. Journal of Herpetology, 39, 4.) The enamel surface is smooth and the crown is subdivided into a lingual and labial surface while the outer surface of the crown is made of enamel and the inner layer is made of dentine. Fossil specimens show evidence of upright vertically positioned developing replacement teeth. Snakes have been thought of as the only squamates with replacement teeth that develop in a horizontal posteriorly inclined position. Snakes deviate from the usual varanoid pattern of tooth replacement, in that their replacement teeth develop in a horizontal inclined position and rotate, however snakes differ from Mosasaurs because they do not possess the resorption pits found in Mosasaurs. Mosasaurs, including Clidastes, and snakes both share the traits of thecodont tooth implantation, and a recumbent position of replacement teeth. However mosasaurs develop replacement teeth by rotating within the resorption pits that are at the base of functional teeth. This is different from snakes because snakes have recumbent replacement teeth that lay horizontal and rotate into functional position when needed. In mosasaurs like Clidastes, once the functional tooth is lost, a new tooth pedicel develops for the replacement tooth. In the case of mosasaurs though, they differ from the thecodont dentition pattern of archosaur and mammals because mosasaurs show true ankylosis and not a fibrous tooth attachment via periodontal ligament that's usually found in mammals and archosaurs.Luan, X., Walker, C., Dangaria, S., Ito, Y., Druzinsky, R., Jarosius, K., Lesot, H Rieppel, O. (January 01, 2009). The mosasaur tooth attachment apparatus as paradigm for the evolution of the gnathostome periodontium. Evolution & Development, 11, 3.) The marginal tooth rows in mosasauroids like Clidastes are found on the premaxilla, maxilla and the dentary. On the dorsal surface of the dentary there is an interdental ridge that separates successive teeth labially. These interdental ridges serve to separate succeeding teeth that grow upward between existing teeth. Occurrences Clidastes is currently found in marine deposits in the US. In past, however, specimens were referred to this genus from Sweden,Lindgren, J., & Siverson, M. (January 01, 2004). The first record of the mosasaur Clidastes from Europe and its palaeogeographical implications. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, 49, 219-234. Germany,Caldwell, M.W., & Diedrich, C.G. 2005. Remains of Clidastes Cope, 1868, an unexpected mosasaur in the upper Campanian of NW Germany. (Igitur.) Igitur. Russia, Mexico, and the Maastrichtian of Jordan. However, Lively (2019) questioned the referral of these remains to Clidastes due to their fragmentary nature and lack of apomorphies placing them in the genus to the exclusion of other mosasaurs.  Discovery  E. D. Cope discovered the first specimens of Clidastes propython in 1869 from the Mooreville Chalk in Lowndes County, Alabama. The remains unearthed were that of a juvenile but are one of the best preserved and most complete mosasaurs collected from the state and is regarded as the generic holotype of Clidastes. In 1918, Charles H. Sternberg and his son found additional remains of Clidastes in Kansas. They were surprised to see that it had humeri and femora with round heads, similar to that of mammals. Due to good preservation of the caudals, Sternberg noted that the chevrons along the vertebrae were ankylosed to the center, which is not observed in other mosasaurs. This synapamorphy was believed to aid in fitting the proximal heads snugly into the basins that hew out from the vertebrae almost locking them in place. Classification and species The dental and vertebral morphology of Clidastes is closer to that of Mosasaurus than to any other mosasaur, firmly placing it within the subfamily Mosasaurinae. Besides being different in size, the teeth of Campanian species of Mosasaurus (namely M. missouriensis and M. conodon) differ from those of Clidastes in having a large number of facets that are also more distinct than those in Clidastes. The cervical vertebrae of Clidastes are also different from those in Mosasaurus by being more elongated. Clidastes is most frequently recovered as one of the most basal mosasaurines, and the most basal hydropedal mosasaurine genus, being more derived than the plesiopedal Dallasaurus but less derived than later genera like Prognathodon or Globidens. The cladogram below is modified from Aaron R. H. Leblanc, Michael W. Caldwell and Nathalie Bardet, 2012: Restoration of three C. propython There is only one named species of Clidastes that is valid, C. propython. Clidastes iguanavus Cope, 1868 was the original type species, but the ICZN was petitioned to make C. propython the new type species by virtue of that species being based on diagnostic remains, which it did vis-√†-vis Opinion 1750 (1993).Kiernan, C.R. 1992. Clidastes Cope, 1868 (Reptilia, Sauria):proposed designation of Clidastes propython Cope, 1869 as the type species. Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 49:137-139.ICZN Opinion 1750. 1993. Clidastes Cope, 1868 (Reptilia, Sauria):C. propython Cope, 1869 designated as the type species. Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 50: 297.  Invalid species  Size comparison of a specimen of C. propython formerly assigned to the now invalid C. velox There is also an undescribed form from the Mooreville Chalk Formation of Alabama that likely represents a new taxon on its own, informally dubbed \\"Clidastes moorevillensis\\", which can be distinguished from both C. propython and C. liodontus based on its dental characteristics. Clidastes liodontus was described from the late Coniacian to early Campanian Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Formation in Kansas. There are also earlier occurrences of the species, dated to the Coniacian, and it might thus be ancestral to the later C. propython. C. liodontus grew to about 3‚Äì4 meters in length compared to the 4-5 meter (and on occasion larger) length of C. propython. The type specimen of C. liodontus, consisting of maxillae, a premaxilla and dentaries from the Niobrara Formation of Kansas, was housed at the Bayerische Staatssammlung f√ºr Pal√§ontologie and may have been destroyed in the Second World War. Russell (1967) diagnosed the species in general as follows: \\"Premaxilla ‚ÄúV‚Äù-shaped in horizontal cross-section, small rostrum present anterior to premaxillary teeth. Posteroventral portion of root of second premaxillary tooth not exposed on sutural surface with maxilla. Premaxillo-maxillary suture rises posteriorly to position varying from dorsal to fourth to dorsal to sixth maxilIary tooth and parallels longitudinal axis of cranium. Fourteen to fifteen teeth in maxilla. Median dorsal surlace of parietal narrow. Parietal foramen small, close to or distinctly separated from frontal suture. Parietal foramen opens ventrally into brain cavity without broadening into wide excavation. Anterior border of prootic descends beneath prootic incisure without forming shelf. Foramen for cranial nerve VII leaves brain cavity through medial wall of prootic. Infrastapedial process absent on quadrate. Sixteen teeth in dentary.\\" Lively (2019) declared Clidastes liodontus a nomen dubium, while taking note of the nomen nudum status of \\"moorevillensis\\", recommending that Clidastes be restricted to C. propython.Joshua R. Lively (2019). \\"Taxonomy and historical inertia: Clidastes (Squamata: Mosasauridae) as a case study of problematic paleobiological taxonomy\\". Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology. in press. doi:10.1080/03115518.2018.1549685.  Clidastes propython  ammonite models at the North American Museum of Ancient Life. C. propython is the best studied species of the genus, and was for this reason chosen by the ICZN to replace C. iguanavus as the type species. C. propython is known from the Campanian of the United States (Alabama, Colorado, Texas, Kansas and South Dakota) and of Sweden. The earliest known occurrences of the species are middle Santonian in age and from the Niobrara Formation of Kansas, whilst the latest are Middle to Late Campanian in age, coinciding with a poorly understood middle Campanian intercontinental mosasaur extinction event, which seems to have heavily affected genera such as Clidastes. Russell (1967) listed the following unambiguous character states for the species: \\"Premaxilla \\"V\\"-shaped in horizontal cross-section, small. rostrum present anterior to premaxillary teeth. Posteroventral portion of root of second premadlary tooth exposed on sutural surface with maxilla. Premaxillo-maxillary suture rises posteriorly in gentle curve to terminate at point above seventh maxillary tooth. Premaxillary suture of maxilla smoothly keeled and paraIIels longitudinal axis of maxilla. Sixteen-18 teeth in maxilla. Median dorsal surface of parietal moderately broad. Parietal foramen smalI, lies close to suture with frontal and opens ventrally into elliptical excavation in parietal, length of which exceeds that of dorsal opening by about five times. Anterior border of prootic forms shelf beneath prootic incisure, then descends abruptly to basisphenoid. Foramen for cranial nerve VII leaves brain cavity through medial wall of prootic. Infrastapedial process present on quadrate. Seventeen to eighteen teeth in dentary.\\". Specimen formerly assigned to C. velox Russell (1967) also referred a large number of fragmentary species of Clidastes to C. propython on the basis of that those with good cranial material were morphologically indistinguishable from the type specimen of C. propython. Among these former species now seen as synonyms of C. propython are C. \\"cineriarum\\", C. \\"dispar\\", C. \\"velox\\", C. \\"wymani\\", C. \\"pumilus\\", C. \\"tortor\\", C. \\"vymanii, C. \\"stenops\\", C. \\"rex\\", C. \\"medius\\" and C. \\"westi\\".  Clidastes iguanavus  The Campanian C. iguanavus is the original type species of Clidastes and poorly known in comparison to C. propython and C. liodontus. The type specimen consists of a single vertebra from the anterior thoracic region, YPM 1601, collected in a marl pit near Swedesboro, New Jersey. The vertebra is similar to that of the other species in its general proportions and the strong zygosphene-zygantrum articulation. C. iguanavus can be differentiated in its central articulations, which are kidney-shaped in outline, with a stronger emargination dorsally for the spinal cord, and in the relatively stout proportions of the centrum.

Secondary schools usually also have between one and five deputy heads (occasionally \\"depute head\\" in Scotland) and several assistant heads, who act as assistants or subordinates to the head teacher or executive head teacher. Commonly, a state school will have between two and six assistant head teachers (AHTs). Each AHT is normally in charge of a specific area of the school, such as administration, staff appraisal, first year, sixth form, discipline etc. Normally, AHTs have only a small teaching role within the school.. A state primary school will usually have a single deputy head, although they may sometimes be replaced by two assistant heads. In some larger primary schools, there may be two deputy heads or a mixture of deputy head and assistant heads. In some primary schools, deputy heads may be class based with some non contact time to carry out leadership or management roles. In other primary schools, the deputy head may not have a full time teaching role, but have a range of whole school leadership responsibilities. The terms \\"deputy headmaster\\" and \\"deputy headmistress\\" used to be the standard throughout both the state and private sectors, with \\"deputy head teacher\\" usually being used only to refer to them collectively. In recent years, however, it has become usual to officially use the gender neutral term in state schools. Nevertheless, the gender specific terms are still in common use, and may be in more formal use in some schools, particularly the remaining state grammar schools. Independent schools usually still officially use the gender specific terms. Some use other terms, such as \\"senior master\\" or \\"second master\\", but these terms have generally gone out of use in the state sector. In state secondary schools, the second master or second mistress was usually the third most senior teacher after the head and deputy head, and in coeducational schools, there was often a second master and a second mistress, in charge of the boys and girls respectively. They were paid a supplement to their ordinary class teacher's salary, as opposed to the head and deputy head, who were paid on separate scales from ordinary teachers. The term \\"second master\\" is still used to refer to the third most senior teacher in some independent schools. In some schools, a deputy head is the third most senior teacher, coming after the senior deputy head. The senior deputy head will run the school in absence of the head teacher. The senior deputy may be the line manager for other deputy headteachers, as well as tackling multiple leadership duties themselves, but this is not always the case. Also, in certain schools usually where the headteacher performs the role of an executive headteacher for other schools the post of associate headteacher is becoming increasingly common. An associate headteacher is more senior than a deputy, but less senior than the head. They are in effect the headteacher in the head's absence or in some cases serve as the headteacher of a school being overseen by an executive headteacher. In many schools, deputy head teachers still retain some teaching responsibility, but in most, their duties are increasingly managerial and pastoral.

Grant, also known as the Minstead Rapist and latterly the Night Stalker, is thought to have been active since 1990, and has a distinctive modus operandi, preying on elderly women who live alone. He is suspected of over 100 offences from 1990 to 2009.London's 'Night Stalker' still prowling. United Press International. 17 June 2009 In 1998, the Metropolitan Police launched the dedicated Operation Minstead team to investigate the crimes, based out of Lewisham police station. (The name does not directly refer to the village of Minstead, Hampshire; rather it was chosen from an alphabetical list of English villages, the method of operational naming in use at the time). As of 2009, the operation was the largest and most complex rape investigation ever undertaken by the Metropolitan Police.Jacobson, Philip (30 January 2005). Investigation: Stalker in the suburbs. The Times. On 24 March 2011, the Jamaican-born Grant was found guilty on all counts. The following day he was given four life sentences and ordered to serve a minimum of 27 years in prison. Emergence of a linked series Grant is an accomplished burglar and has broken into the homes of over 90 elderly women aged between 68 and 93.Man held in 'nightstalker' rapes probe. Press Association. 15 November 2009. He is positively linked to four reported rapes and around 30 other sexual assaults. Police believe he is also responsible for at least another two rapes where the victims felt unable to make any official allegation. The true total may be higher as his victims are often too traumatised to speak to police. In addition, the Operation Minstead investigation team have to decide which incidents are unmistakably the work of the same offender and which are similar but possibly unrelated. Therefore, many possible Minstead incidents flagged up by police for the attention of the Operation Minstead team cannot be definitely confirmed as the work of the same offender so must be excluded from the linked series. The confirmed series of offences began in October 1992 in the Shirley area of Croydon. However, due to a break of four years between this first attack and a spate of others, Operation Minstead was not set up until 1998. Although committing many crimes, Grant was dormant for long periods. After the first attack in October 1992, no further offences were reported until 1997. After a particularly violent rape on 5 August 1999 where his victim almost died from her injuries, there was another long break. This prompted some media speculation that the rapist had been imprisoned for an unrelated offence or that he had died. However, on 13 October 2002, ten years after the first attack, he struck again.Cockcroft, Lucy (6 June 2008). 'Night Stalker' rapist attacks three more pensioners. The Telegraph. Seven confirmed attacks took place in the summer of 2003. Another break then followed. A further series of confirmed attacks took place towards the end of 2008, and into mid-2009. Detective Superintendent Simon Morgan who headed the Minstead team from 2001 to October 2009, explained the problems in arriving at a definitive total of offences in this series by saying \\"His victims come from a generation who are inclined to see good in everyone. One thanked him for being gentle when he raped her\\". Another said she did not want to dial 999 \\"because I know the police are already so busy\\".\\"Minstead monster\\". March 2006 Geographical spread The offences occurred in defined geographical clusters in and around South East London. Most of the offences occurred around Shirley in Croydon, and also Orpington. However he also struck in Coulsdon, Forest Hill, Catford, Brockley, Bromley, Beckenham, Dulwich and Sidcup. Only once was there a report of his offending outside Greater London. This was in Warlingham, Surrey.Davenport, Justin (23 December 2004). Night stalker strikes again . ThisisLondon. The fact that many offences have taken place in Orpington, including one on Boxing Day in 1998, led detectives to suspect the rapist had a link to the area. Det Supt Morgan has said \\"He either lives, works or has some connection with someone he visits in Orpington. This could be a child, a school or a job\\". On three occasions, he made remarks about having to get to Brighton.\\"Scarf clue in hunt for Night Stalker\\". The Evening Standard. 23 October 2006 Victimology Grant usually singled out lone elderly women as victims. It is thought that he was meticulous in planning his crimes. He may have placed his potential victims under surveillance for some time, since he never broke into a house occupied by anyone but a lone elderly occupant. He once targeted three houses in a single street. He picked detached or semi-detached houses and bungalows, but never flats. Modus operandi Grant gained entry to the homes of his victims from the side or the rear, either through open windows or by removing a window pane entirely. He had been known to use tools stolen from the victim's own garden shed to remove the window beading. He ripped out the telephone wires, either before entering the property, or after gaining access. He then disabled the lights either by switching off the electricity at the meter or by unscrewing lightbulbs from their sockets.Fletcher, Martin (21 October 2006). Inside the mind of a rapist who preys on old women. The Times. He then approached his victim, shining a torch in her eyes. Often his first words were to demand sex. However, he had been known to spend hours in victims' homes either before or without assaulting them. He had been described perversely as exhibiting tenderness, sometimes gently kissing his victims on the cheek. He had exhibited a knowledge of geriatrics, knowing how to support his elderly victim's spine and how to pick them up from the elbow. He had sometimes been shamed into leaving without committing a sexual assault when his victim has chastised him. Of particular note is an incident where one victim caused him to apologise and leave by angrily demanding \\"What would your mother think of you?\\" He was also known to have apologised after taking a victim's pulse, saying: \\"I‚Äôm really sorry. I won‚Äôt do this again.\\" Police have speculated that Grant was ashamed of his actions, perhaps explaining the long period that sometimes occurred between offences. Despite this, he could be extremely violent. During his most violent attack on 5 August 1999, he raped his victim twice and left her bleeding from a perforated bowel, injuries which nearly proved fatal.Boffey, Chris (28 April 2004). Serial rapist's DNA is traced to West Indies. The Daily Telegraph. Grant had been known to burgle his victims, but this was not his primary motive. He often took money, but only small amounts. He also took credit cards and obtained their PINs from his victims, but there has never been any record of him using them. In 2004 he stole a wad of five pound notes, but these were later discovered thrown away a mile and a half from his victim's house. He had also taken jewellery. The same year he told a victim that his mother had died four years earlier, stating that \\"the Government let her down anyway\\". He struck on all days of the week, but most often during the early hours of a Friday or Saturday morning. Detectives strongly believed that he rode a motorbike.\\"Now Night Stalker is starting to attack men\\". The Evening Standard. 10 October 2006. Suspect description Descriptions from his many victims suggested a black male aged between 25 and 40. He was described as about 5'9\\" to 5'11\\" tall, of slim athletic build and tended to wear dark clothing. He was usually wearing gloves, a mask or balaclava, and occasionally a baseball cap. He was also described as having a soft or well-spoken voice. Some of his victims reported a curious sweet smell. DNA controversy The Minstead Rapist was thought to be forensically aware since he never left a fingerprint at any scene.Ford, Richard; Tendler, Stewart (9 July 2004). Innocent men forced to give DNA samples. The Times. However, an offence committed on 13 October 2002 left behind a vital clue ‚Äì a footprint from a size 10 Nike Air Terra Contego trainer. Most importantly he did not use condoms and his DNA was captured. The first time his DNA was discovered at a scene was in 1992. Since then, more than 2,000 DNA samples have been collected from suspects.Greenwood, Chris (6 November 2009). 2,000 DNA tests in hunt for 'night stalker'. The Independent. Britain's national police DNA database contains samples from anyone arrested for a recordable offence since 1995. Even by the time of his first offence, the Minstead Rapist was clearly an accomplished burglar. However his DNA remained unmatched and unidentified on the database. If the rapist had ever been arrested for burglary or a related offence, it must have been before 1995 when police began routinely to gather DNA samples from prisoners. Advanced DNA techniques pointed towards a north Afro-Caribbean ethnic origin for the rapist; probably the Windward Islands ‚Äì St Lucia, Barbados, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Tobago or Trinidad. Operation Minstead identified around 21,000 possible suspects that fitted such a profile. In March 2004, Operation Minstead detectives hand-delivered a letter to hundreds of black men in South London, asking for their help in voluntarily providing a DNA sample for elimination purposes. Police explained that they desperately needed to reduce the vast number of suspects in the operation and that this was the best way to do so. Volunteers were assured that their DNA sample would be destroyed as soon as it was confirmed to be unmatched with the rapist's DNA. The majority of those potential suspects were eager to help if it would assist police in catching the suspect. However 125 men initially refused to provide a sample, believing it was discriminatory and breached their human rights. Police brought pressure to bear on those who refused, explaining that their behaviour could be construed as suspicious. Five objectors were subsequently arrested but cleared. This incident was seen by some commentators, particularly The Voice newspaper and Liberty, as an abuse of power that damaged relations between London's black community and the police.\\"Swab Squad\\" The Voice. 29 March 2005 A Liberal Democrat MP, Lynne Featherstone, questioned police tactics in the House of Commons.Operation Minstead. Hansard written answers Although they were able to reduce the list of potential suspects from 21,000 to 1,000, police resigned themselves to only being able to obtain the DNA of certain suspects still on the list if and when they were arrested for an unrelated offence.Metropolitan Police committee report .

Burglary (theft/attempted theft with violence) ‚Äì on 6/20/1999 at Beckenham According to newspaper reports the suspect was seen by cash machine CCTV cameras using his victims' credit and debit cards, but appeared useless as his face was always covered by a mask. One eagle-eyed police officer was reported to have spotted in some of the footage the reflection of a bus in a shop window. The bus was tracked down and was found to be fitted with cameras. Police trawled through the CCTV footage recorded by the bus. On the recording a Vauxhall Zafira was spotted near the cash machine and vehicle records pinpointed all models in the South London area. However, this is a gross distortion of the truth; in fact the officers taking part in the observations had identified a Zafira as a suspected vehicle some two weeks previously, and thus were particularly alert to such a car being in the area of their operation. Then on Sunday evening (15 November) a Zafira was spotted parked in the Shirley area of Croydon, which was already being staked out by 70 police officers following recent break-ins believe to have been carried out by the Night Stalker. Delroy Grant was arrested as he approached his car having just attempted to enter a nearby pensioner's house. On 24 March 2011 Grant was found guilty of all offences charged. He was sentenced to concurrent life sentences with a recommendation that he should serve 27 years before being eligible to apply for parole.

The territory of the ancient city and the surrounding area was proclaimed a territory of national importance and an archaeological reserve in 1965. Many of the finds are housed in the on-site museum.  Geography  Kabile village is located 3 km northwest of Yambol. Zaychi vrah, the last hill of the Sredna Gora mountain range, can be found 1.5 km north of Kabile. The road from Yambol to the village of Zhelyu Voyvoda (in the Sliven Province) passes through Kabile, as well as the road from Yambol to the village of Drazhevo. The name of the city originates from Cybele.Velkov, V. 1982 Cabyle. Topography, research, sources. In: Cabyle, vol. I. Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia: 7-17. /in Bulg./ Ancient Kabyle was at an important crossroads through antiquity. From here the road from Aenus (Thrace) (today's Enez) led to Hemus (Stara Planina) and the lower Danube, as well as the diagonal road (Via Diagonalis) from Byzantium through Serdica (Sofia) to the middle Danube.  History  Roman Fort Inside of Fort gate Large (Military) baths Early History The site was inhabited since the 2nd millennium BC and traces of a Neolithic culture have been unearthed. Ceramics discovered from the 10th to the 6th century BC prove that the site was inhabited during the early Iron Age as well.Velkov, V. 3, 1977, . In 341 BC the town was founded or refounded by Philip II of Macedon, who fortified it; subsequently, the town became a polis. It was under the rule of Alexander the Great and Lysimachus until 280 BC, when in 279 BC it briefly fell under the control of King Cavarus of the Celtic Kingdom of Tylis and the city minted coins on behalf of Cavarus. In about 277 BC it came under the control of the Thracian Odrysian kingdom and was one of the kings' residences. The so-called \\"great inscription\\" of Seuthopolis testifies to the importance of Kabyle in these times. The city was a major trade and military centre between the 3rd and the 2nd c. BC. However, its activities later waned due to aggressive campaigns by Philip V of Macedon.An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen, 2005, page 893 Roman History In 71 BC it became part of the Roman Empire after being conquered by Marcus Lucullus and after 45 BC it was included in the Roman province of Thracia. Part of the site was occupied by a fort, one of the largest in the region. From discovered inscriptions, the cohort II Lucensium, from Abritus and consisting of nominally 480 foot soldiers and 120 cavalry, was stationed in the fort from 136 (under Hadrian) to 192 AD and built the associated thermae in 166 to 169.http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2018/07/05/intact-roman-inscription-from- marcus-aurelius-rule-found-in-ancient-thracian-city-kabyle-in-southeast- bulgaria/ After their move to Germania (Sapareva Banya)http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/background-infonotes/fortresses- cities/germania-germaneia-sapareva-banya-bulgaria/ they were replaced by the cohort I Atoitorum from 192 AD. The city was badly damaged by in the Gothic Wars in 267-9. Nevertheless the city and the fort were soon rebuilt, as many towns in the region were under Diocletian, and in 293 it became a city again. A castellum of 5 hectares replaced the earlier military camp, a new fort wall was built with square towers, and the city wall and the large 3rd c. thermae of the fort were restored. The large and elaborate tribunorum for about 12 officers and dating from the early 270s was excavated in 2017 and a recently translated inscription shows another larger cohort (milliaria) with about 800 foot soldiers was present.http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2017/11/14/archaeologists-find-roman- military-officers-residence-tribunorium-ancient-thracian-city-kabile-near- bulgarias-yambol/ New large public buildings were built and Kabyle became one of the most important cities of Thracia following the reforms of Emperor Diocletian.http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2016/10/24/archaeologists-find- unknown-late-antiquity-quarter-showing-ancient-thracian-city-kabyle- flourished-in-late-roman-period/ Christianity became widespread in the area as early as the 4th century AD, and Kabyle became a bishopric with a large basilica. In 378 Kabyle was seized by the Goths under Fritigernus. In the 5th century repeated barbarian raids forced the inhabitants to retreat inside the fort. The fort wall was doubled in the most vulnerable places and the thermae were used as residences and many other houses were built. The town was finally destroyed in about 587 by the Avars and only partially settled afterwards. In the 9th century the surrounding region was fully integrated into the Bulgarian Empire and a small Bulgarian settlement was established over the ancient ruins. The Site Civilian baths The ancient city has been partially excavated and work is continuing. Recently the principia of the Roman fort have been discovered.http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2018/07/05/intact-roman- inscription-from-marcus-aurelius-rule-found-in-ancient-thracian-city-kabyle- in-southeast-bulgaria/#more-11333 The Hellenistic city had defensive walls from the last quarter of the 4th c. BC, an agora and temples to Jupiter Dolichenus, the Thracian Horseman, Asclepius and Hygia. It has an acropolis with a sanctuary and relief of Cybele, its namesake and patron deity, carved into the rock. The military fort occupied part of the city from Roman times, including the later barracks (one for cavalry) and large thermal baths. Smaller thermal baths lie inside the civilian town dating initially from the early 1st c. BC and were at first associated with a palaestra. The large christian basilica and smaller later one inside the fort have been partially restored. Cavalry Barracks The Large Basilica The bishop's basilica was built in the 340's as one of the earliest examples of one with a courtyard in the region. It was damaged in 377-8 in the invasions. It was rebuilt and enlarged in the early 5th c. and became the 2nd biggest in Thracia, complete with mosaic floors, until its destruction in 587. It was partially rebuilt again until abandonment in the early 7th c.  Economy  Most of Kabile's population works in Yambol. The economy is based on agriculture. There is also a factory for sweets.

Pakistan is the first Muslim country in the world to construct and operate civil nuclear power plants.Nuclear power in Pakistan, Dr. Zia H. Siddiqui and Dr. I.H. Qureshi, pp.31‚Äì33. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), the scientific and nuclear governmental agency, is solely responsible for operating these power plants. As of 2012, the electricity generated by commercial nuclear power plants constitutes roughly 3.6% of electricity generated in Pakistan, compared to about 62% from fossil fuel and 33% from hydroelectric power. Pakistan is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Pakistan plans on constructing 32 nuclear power plants by 2050. History Professor (and later Nobel laureate) Abdus Salam, as Science Advisor to the President, persuaded President Ayub Khan, to establish Pakistan's first commercial nuclear power reactor, near Karachi. Known as Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), the commercial power plant is a small 137 MWe CANDU reactor, a Canadian pressurized heavy water reactor. PAEC's Parvez Butt, a nuclear engineer, was project-director. The KANUPP began its operations in 1972, and it was inaugurated by President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Munir Ahmad Khan as PAEC chairman. The KANUPP which is under international safeguards is operated at reduced power. In 1969, France's Commissariat √† l'√©nergie atomique and United Kingdom's British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL) contracted with PAEC to provide plutonium and nuclear reprocessing plants in Pakistan. Per the agreement, the PAEC engineers were the lead designers of the power plants and nuclear-reprocessing facilities. While the BNFL and CEA provided the funds, technical assistance, and nuclear materials. The work on projects did not start until 1972, and as a result of India's Operation Smiling Buddha ‚Äî a surprise nuclear test in 1974 ‚Äî the BNFL cancelled the projects with PAEC. In 1974, PARR-II Reactor were commissioned, and its project directors were Munir Ahmad Khan and Hafeez Qureshi. The PARR-II is an indigenous reactor that was built under the auspices of PAEC's engineers and scientists. In 1977, due to pressure exerted by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the CEA cancelled the projects with PAEC immediately. Without the assistance of United Kingdom and France, the PAEC engineers completed the plutonium nuclear reprocessing plant ‚Äî New Labs ‚Äî and the plutonium reactor ‚Äî Khushab Nuclear Complex. Both power plants are commercial power plants control by PAEC. In 1989, People's Republic of China signed an agreement with Pakistan to provide 300 MWe CHASNUPP-I power plant under the IAEA safeguards. In 1990, both France and the Soviet Union considered Pakistan's request to provide the commercial nuclear power plants under the IAEA safeguards. But, after the American Ambassador to Pakistan's Robert Oakley expressed U.S. displeasure at the agreements between the Soviet Union and France, the contracts were cancelled. By the 2000, China had expanded its contract with PAEC and is currently assisting in construction of III, and IV power plants. II was completed in April 2011. Due to its growing electricity demands, the Pakistan Government ordered PAEC to set up nuclear power plants in the country. According to PAEC, the goal is to produce 8800 MW electricity by 2030. Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani announced the Pakistan national energy policy in 2010 while the feasibility report was submitted in Prime Minister's Secretariat ‚Äî the official residence of the prime minister of Pakistan. The PAEC is currently planning to lead the construction of the KANUPP-II nuclear power plant ‚Äî a 1100 MWe power plant ‚Äî and the KANUPP-III ‚Äî 1100 MWe. While the commercial plants will be indigenously built, the preliminary work is put on hold as of 2009. In 2010, the Nuclear Power Fuel Complex (PNPFC) ‚Äî a nuclear reprocessing power plant ‚Äî was commissioned. PAEC led the construction, designing, and maintenance of the facility, while China and IAEA provided funds to the facility. On 26 November 2013 prime minister Nawaz Sharif performed the groundbreaking ceremony for two nuclear power plants with a combined capacity of 2200 MW near Karachi. International co-operation=China China has been a strong vocal and avid supporter of Pakistan's nuclear power generation programme from the early on. The history of Chinese-Pakistan cooperation dates back to the 1970s when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, as prime minister, first visited China. The strong academic interaction between Chinese and Pakistan scientists was begun in the 1970s. In 1986, the scientists from KRL and military engineers of the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers built a HEU enrichment plant in Hanzhong province of PRC, and provided technical assistance to China in weapon-grade centrifuge technology for Chinese nuclear weapons. From the 1980s to the present, China has contracted with Pakistan to use of civil and electricity purpose use of nuclear technology. As of 1990 contract, the second commercial nuclear power plant is CHASNUPP-I in Punjab‚Äîa 325 MWe PWR‚Äîsupplied by China's China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) under IAEA safeguards. The main part of the plant was designed by Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute (SNERDI), based on Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant. The commercial nuclear power plant began its operations May 2000. In 2005, China expanded its contract with Pakistan, and vowed to build more nuclear power plants in Pakistan. Construction of its twin, CHASNUPP-II, started in December 2005. It is reported to cost PkR 51.46 billion (US$860 million, with $350 million of this financed by China). In a meeting with IAEA, an IAEA safeguard agreement with PAEC and IAEA was signed in 2006, and the grid connection is expected in spring of 2011. The enriched fuel takes place in Pakistan's PNPFC facility, which is also under IAEA safeguards. In 2005, both Pakistan government and the Chinese government adopted an Energy Security Plan, calling for a huge increase in generating capacity to more than 160,000 MWe by 2030. Pakistan Government plans for lifting nuclear capacity to 8800 MWe, 900 MWe of it by 2015 and a further 1500 MWe by 2020. Plans included four further Chinese reactors of 300 MWe each and seven of 1000 MWe, all PWR. There were tentative plans for China to build two 1000 MWe PWR units at Karachi as KANUPP II and III, but China then in 2007 deferred development of its CNP-1000 type which is the only one able to be exported. However, Last November 2012, China rolled out its new advanced 1000 MW pressurised water nuclear power reactor, ACPR-1000 at the Hi-Tech Fair in Shenzhen. This reactor was \\"independently\\" developed by China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation with full IPR and made its debut at the 13th China Hi-Tech Fair, according to the official media. Since this reactor has been developed by China independently without the involvement of foreign suppliers, it is quite likely that China will export this reactor to Pakistan. PAEC is now currently preparing reports and planning to set up small but more commercial nuclear power plants indigenously. In June 2008, the Pakistan Government announced plans to build commercial nuclear power plants III and IV commercial nuclear power plants at Chashma, Punjab Province, each with 320‚Äì340 MWe and costing PKR 129 billion, 80 billion of this from international sources, principally China. A further agreement for China's help with the project was signed in October 2008, and given prominence as a counter to the US‚ÄìIndia agreement shortly preceding it. Cost quoted then was US$1.7 billion, with a foreign loan component of $1.07 billion. In March 2009, SNERDI announced that it was proceeding with design of CHASNUPP-III and IV, with China Zhongyuan Engineering as the general contractor. The PAEC said Beijing was financing 85% of the US$1.6 billion project. Contracts for CHASNUPP-I and II were signed in 1990 and 2000, before 2004 when China joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which maintains an embargo on sales of nuclear equipment to Pakistan, but there are questions about China's supply of Chasma-3 and 4. On 24 September 2010, China informed the IAEA that it will implement an agreement with Pakistan on the export of two nuclear reactors for Islamabad's Chashma nuclear complex. Beijing has said that the reactor deal is part of a 2003 agreement between the two countries, a claim many have questioned, though Germany has accepted. These will be the third and fourth reactors at the complex. According to the Chinese communication to the IAEA, the reactors will be placed under international safeguards. Concerns have been expressed over the lack the safety features incorporated into the Chashma-3 and Chashma-4 reactors, which are alleged to use a design which is not considered safe enough to build in China. In March 2013, Pakistan and China agreed to build a 1000 MW CHASNUPP-5 at Chashma Nuclear Power Complex. In July 2013, it was announced that Pakistani officials were considering approval of KANUPP-2, a 1,000 megawatt reactor to be built with assistance from China. France In May 2009, France agreed to cooperate with Pakistan on nuclear safety, which Pakistan's Foreign Minister called a 'significant development' related to the transfer of civilian nuclear technology to Pakistan. But later a spokesman for the French presidency was careful to rein in expectations, saying Mr Sarkozy had \\"confirmed France was ready, within the framework of its international agreements, to co-operate with Pakistan in the field of nuclear safety.\\" In October 2013, French Ambassador Philippe Thiebaud said \\"my country is ready to consider the request for enhancing civil nuclear cooperation in line with international obligations.\\" United States In a U.S.‚ÄìPakistan strategic dialogue on 24 March 2010, Pakistan pressed for a civil nuclear cooperation deal similar to that with India. One analyst suggested that such a deal was unrealistic at present but might be possible in 10‚Äì15 years. Japan In 2011, Dr. Irfan Yusuf Shami, the Director-General (Disarmament) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan and Makyo Maya Gawa, the Director-General of Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed an agreement for nuclear non- proliferation in Tokyo. Both countries agreed on maintaining stability in South Asia. In 2011, during the state visit of President Asif Zardari, Pakistan sought civil nuclear power cooperation with Japan, similarly to a previous deal between Japan and India. According to the Jang News group, the Japanese government refused the deal with Pakistan. [ Japan denied the civil power cooperation with Pakistan] According to the Pakistan Media, the Pakistan officials were highly disappointed with Japanese denial. On the other hand, Japanese officials were left disappointed as Pakistan had denied the Japanese request to support Japan's candidacy for permanent seat for the United Nations Security Council. Fuel cycle The government has set a target of producing 350 tonnes (U3O8)per year from 2015 to meet one third of anticipated requirements then. Low grade Ore is known in central Punjab Province at Bannu Basin and Suleman Range. A small (15,000 SWU/yr) uranium centrifuge enrichment plant at Kahuta has been operated by the KRL since 1984 and does not have any apparent civil use. It was expanded threefold about 1991. A newer plant is reported to be at Gadwal which is operated by PAEC. The plant is not under safeguards of IAEA. In 2006, the PAEC announced that it was preparing to set up separate and purely civil conversion, enrichment and fuel fabrication plants as a new US$1.2 billion Nuclear Power Fuel Complex which would be under IAEA safeguards and managed separately from existing facilities. At least the enrichment plant would be built at Chak Jhumra, Faisalabad, in the Punjab and have a 150,000 SWU/yr capacity in five years ‚Äî about 2013, then be expanded in 150,000 SWU increments to be able to supply one third of the enrichment requirements for a planned 8800 MWe generating capacity by 2030. Radioactive wastes management The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) is responsible for the radioactive waste management. From 1972, the PAEC has undertaken to establish the safety objectives, management, and radioactive waste management. In 2004, the PNRA issued guidelines for the management of nuclear and radioactive waste management in nuclear and medical research centers under PAEC. In 2010, the PNRA issued regulatory policy on radioactive waste materials, and Pakistan lawmakers presented the regulatory policy in Pakistan Parliament. The Parliament passed the PNRA regulatory policy unanimously, making it into laws. The PNRA proposed new Waste Management offices to control of the radiation and radioactive materials. The Waste Management Centres are proposed for Karachi, Rawalpindi, Nilore, Lahore and Chashma. Used fuel is currently stored at each reactor in pools. Longer- term dry storage at each site is proposed. The question of future reprocessing remains open. A National Repository for low- and intermediate-level wastes is due to be commissioned by 2015. Nuclear reprocessing The country also has operated one indigenous reprocessing plant, built by PAEC, which was known as the New Labs ‚Äî outside PINSTECH, Nilore, near Islamabad. The PAEC had contracted with British BNFL for a reprocessing facility which was cancelled in 1974. It was built under the leadership of Mr. Munir Ahmad KhanMunir Ahmad Khan, How Pakistan made nuclear fuel, The Nation, 1998 The plant became functional in the early 1980s, and it is not under IAEA inspection. The second nuclear reprocessing plant was also started by PAEC under Munir Ahmad Khan, in 1976, at Chashma, under a contract agreement with France However, France cancelled the agreement for the said plant under US influence in August 1978 . In 2006, the PAEC started work another nuclear fuel fabrication plant ‚Äî Pakistan Nuclear Power Fuel Complex ‚Äî located 175 kilometers south near Islamabad. An indigenous Nuclear Fuel Fabrication Complex at Kundian, known as Kundian Nuclear Fuel Complex (KNFC), already exists which was built by PAEC under Munir Ahmad Khan and completed by 1980. Kundian Nuclear Fuel Complex makes nuclear fuel for KANUPP. However, the 2006 PNPFC project is being financed by the joint Sino-Pak Nuclear Technology Consortium, and the PAEC is leading the designing and construction of the plant. It will be under safeguards but KNFC is not under safeguards. The Pakistan Nuclear Power Fuel Complex is under the IAEA safeguards and inspections as the IAEA also contributed in the mega project financially. Radiation control The PAEC's directorate for Nuclear Safety and Radiation Control (NSRC) was responsible for the radiation and high radioactive material control in the country. However, in 2001, with the establishment of the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA), the responsibilities were shifted to PNRA. In 2003, the responsibilities and agency's goals were expanded, as PNRA were given the status of an executive agency. The PNRA oversees reactor safety and security, reactor licensing and renewal, radioactive material safety, security and licensing, and spent fuel management (storage, security, recycling, and disposal).Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA), PNRA official site. The PNRA closely work with Chinese CNNC, and is frequently visited by Chinese staff as its technical advisers. Nuclear accidents On 18‚Äì19 October 2011, the KANUPP Karachi nuclear power plant imposed a seven-hour emergency after heavy water leaked from a feeder pipe to the reactor. The leakage took place during a routine maintenance shut down, and the emergency was lifted seven hours later, after the affected area was isolated. Industry and academic The Pakistan Nuclear Society (PNS) is a scientific and educational society that has both industry and academic members. The organization publishes large amount of scientific literature on nuclear technology on several journals. The PNS also allied itself with American Nuclear Society (ANS), European Nuclear Society (ENS), Indian Nuclear Society (INS), Korean Nuclear Society (KNS), Chinese Nuclear Society (CNS), Hungarian Nuclear Society (HNS), and the Spanish Nuclear Society (SNS). The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission also published large sums of publication, and published a quarterly magazine ‚Äî The Nucleus. The PAEC's academic scientists and engineers also publishes the newsletter ‚Äî The PakAtom ‚Äî concerning on nuclear technology and lobbying for the commercial nuclear power plants. Academic research The academic research on nuclear technology began in 1956, with the establishment of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. In 1965, United States provided a 10 MW research reactor ‚Äì Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor-I (PARR) ‚Äì to Pakistan. The PARR-Reactor consists of three research reactors with a single nuclear particle accelerator. The first reactor was supplied by the U.S. government in 1965 and it is operated by the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH). In 1969, the Center for Nuclear Studies was established, and it began its research in a small reactor that was provided by the PAEC. In 1989, the PAEC had built another small research reactor, known as Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor-II reactor. The PARR-II reactor is an indigenously built reactor by the PAEC, and is under IAEA safeguards since IAEA had funded this mega-project. In 1986, another \\"multipurpose\\" heavy water reactor, a 50 MWe pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) near Khushab, was built. Known as Khushab-I, it went critical and started its operations in April 1998. The complex is evidently for producing weapons-grade plutonium, isotope production and nuclear reprocessing. A similar or possibly larger heavy water reactor has been under construction at Khushab since about 2002. Khushab is reported to be making demands upon the country's limited uranium resources. Reprocessing of weapon-grade material is reported to take place at Chashma Nuclear Complex, 80 km west.

Established in 1912, they folded in 1996. The club spent its entire existence in non-league football, where they won various championships over the years. Perhaps Goole's crowning achievement was reaching the FA Cup third round in 1956‚Äì57 before going out to Nottingham Forest. History The club was founded in 1912 as Goole Town Football Club when they entered into the Midland Football League. Town played in that league for three seasons, finishing each season respectably and with a highest position of 4th place in 1914‚Äì15. That same season they reached the First Round of the FA Cup, but lost to Middlesbrough 9‚Äì3 at Ayresome Park. Play was suspended because of the First World War and Goole did not re-enter the Midland League afterwards. However, just after the war, as Goole Shipyards Football Club they became founding members of the Yorkshire Football League for the 1920‚Äì21 season. In 1924 the club had reverted to the Goole Town name and were back in the Yorkshire League. By the late 1920s Goole had proved themselves at this level, their pinnacle in this period being their championship-winning season in 1927‚Äì28. Goole continued in the Yorkshire League throughout the 1930s and 1940s, picking up the championship during both the 1936‚Äì37 and 1947‚Äì48 seasons. Return to the Midland League In 1948, Goole Town decided to return to the Midland Football League, which they had not competed in since the start of the First World War. At the end of 1950‚Äì51, they finished in 3rd place above the likes of Peterborough United and Boston United. For the rest of the 1950s however, Goole lingered in the lower regions of the league, but had one very notable FA Cup run. In the 1956‚Äì57 season Goole Town reached the Third Round of the FA Cup, having previously knocked out Wigan Athletic 2‚Äì1 away and Football League Third Division North side Workington, before finally going out to Nottingham Forest.FCHD.info The 1960s for Goole Town was largely uneventful in the league; the majority of the time they finished around mid-table, with a decent 5th-place finish in 1967‚Äì68 being the highlight. That season they had also taken Spennymoor United to a first round replay in the FA Cup. Northern Premier League Goole Town became one of the founding members of the Northern Premier League in 1968, where they played against the likes of Macclesfield Town, Scarborough and Stafford Rangers ‚Äì alongside old rivals Boston United and Wigan Athletic. During the first-ever season of the league, they finished in 8th place. Their best finish in the Northern Premier League was 6th place on two occasions these were the 1976‚Äì77 season and then again in the 1988‚Äì89 season, while their worst finishes were in 1970‚Äì71, 1985‚Äì86 and 1992‚Äì93 seasons when they finished in last place on each occasion. They reached the quarterfinal of the FA Trophy in the 1974‚Äì75 season, losing at home to Matlock Town 1‚Äì0 before a crowd of 3,500. The club folded at the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season due to financial difficulties. A new club, Goole A.F.C., was formed in its place.

It is produced by OriginLab Corporation, and runs on Microsoft Windows. It has inspired several platform-independent open-source clones and alternatives like LabPlot and SciDAVis. Graphing support in Origin includes various 2D/3D plot types. Data analyses in Origin include statistics, signal processing, curve fitting and peak analysis. Origin's curve fitting is performed by a nonlinear least squares fitter which is based on the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm. Origin imports data files in various formats such as ASCII text, Excel, NI TDM, DIADem, NetCDF, SPC, etc. It also exports the graph to various image file formats such as JPEG, GIF, EPS, TIFF, etc. There is also a built-in query tool for accessing database data via ADO. Features Origin Workbook with sparklines above data columns, this allows a quick glance of the data without plotting them. Origin is primarily a GUI software with a spreadsheet front end. Unlike popular spreadsheets like Excel, Origin's worksheet is column oriented. Each column has associated attributes like name, units and other user definable labels. Instead of cell formula, Origin uses column formula for calculations. Recent versions of Origin have introduced and expanded on batch capabilities, with the goal of eliminating the need to program many routine operations. Instead the user relies on customizable graph templates, analysis dialog box Themes which save a particular suite of operations, auto recalculation on changes to data or analysis parameters, and Analysis Templates‚Ñ¢ which save a collection of operations within the workbook. Origin also has a scripting language (LabTalk) for controlling the software, which can be extended using a built-in C/C++-based compiled language (Origin C). Other programming options include an embedded Python environment, and an R Console plus support for Rserve. Origin can be also used as a COM server for programs which may be written in Visual Basic .NET, C#, LabVIEW, etc. Origin project files (.OPJ) can be read by the open-source SciDAVis software. The files can also be read by QtiPlot but only with a paid \\"Pro\\" version. Finally the liboriginhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/liborigin library can also read .OPJ files such as by using the \`opj2dat\` script, which exports the data tables contained in the file. There is also a free component (Orglab) maintained by Originlab that can be used to create (or read) OPJ files. A free Viewer application is also available. Editions and support Origin is available in two editions, the regular version Origin and the pricier OriginPro. The latter adds additional data analysis features like surface fitting, short-time Fourier Transform, and more advanced statistics.Review article in Journal of Cheminformatics, Jan 2018 Technical support is available to registered users via e-mail, online chat, and telephone.

Early life and family Helme, born in Kingston, Pennsylvania, was the ninth child and fifth son of Major Oliver Helme (descendant of an old Rhode Island family begun by Christopher Helme) by his second wife Sarah Pease Fish.Blair, \\"The Michael Shoemaker Book.\\" (Wyoming, Pennsylvania: International Textbook Press, 1924). p. 773 As a young man George Helme obtained a clerkship with Asa Packer, a wealthy contractor involved in the construction of locks, boats, and railroads for the transport of coal (and who eventually founded Lehigh University). In his mid-twenties, Helme resigned his position with Mr. Packer and moved to Louisiana, where his older brother Samuel was living. There he studied law and was admitted to the bar in New Orleans around 1851, subsequently establishing his own law practice, which he continued until the outbreak of the Civil War. He returned north to marry Margaret Appleby in 1856 in Spotswood, New Jersey. Their first two children, daughters, were born before the Civil War. The first child, born in New Jersey in 1857, died a year later. Their second child was born in New Jersey in 1859. Their third child was born in Chatawa, Mississippi (about 100 miles north of New Orleans) in 1862, just after war broke out. Their last child, a son, was born after the war in 1866 in New Jersey. Civil War Helme left his law practice and enlisted in the Confederate States Army on March 8, 1862 in New Orleans as a Captain in the Crescent Regiment, commanding Company G, Marion Rangers, nicknamed the Ruggles Guards. The regiment went immediately to Corinth, Mississippi, to reinforce General P. G. T. Beauregard's army. On April 6, 1862 the regiment played an important role in the capture of two Federal divisions during the Battle of Shiloh. The regiment commander's report of the engagement cited Captain Helme as \\"among the line officers I have great satisfaction in mentioning ... as distinguished for coolness, bravery, and the faithful discharge of their duty...\\" The regiment was disbanded on June 3, 1862 at the expiration of its 90-day enlistment, most of the men being transferred into the 18th Louisiana Regiment. Captain Helme resigned on June 19, 1862, when he was transferred to the mining service of the Trans-Mississippi Department. This assignment may have been related to an act of April 11, 1862, establishing the \\"Niter and Mining Bureau\\", which was charged with the securing of niter (saltpeter) for the manufacture of gunpowder, copper, lead, iron, coal, zinc, and other such materials as might be required for the prosecution of the war. The Bureau opened new coalfields in North Carolina and Alabama and coordinated the flow of mineral fuel to Confederate naval stations along the coast. A corps of officers was established for this purpose. Captain Helme's earlier experience back in Pennsylvania working for Asa Packer may have influenced this assignment. On June 9, 1864 another act was passed which increased the rank of the officers involved. There is nothing in the early Confederate records to indicate that Helme was anything other than a Captain, although later biographical sketches identify him as a Major General. (His son-in-law, Charles Godfrey Strater, identified him as a Major in a private family document printed in 1928.) When the war ended, Helme returned north, to New Jersey and New York City, where he engaged in the real estate business for several years, acquiring considerable property. Helmetta: Snuff town In 1866 he formed a co-partnership with his brother-in-law Jacob Appleby, for the manufacture of snuff and tobacco. This lasted until 1877 or 1878, when Helme became the full owner of the enterprise, eventually renamed the George W. Helme Tobacco Company, and one of the largest snuff producers in the country. During the middle 1880s he purchased land between Spotswood and Jamesburg, New Jersey on which his mill and 105 homes for workers were built. This area, initially known as Railroad Mills, became Helmetta, New Jersey, and was reputedly named after his youngest daughter Olivia Antoinette, whose nickname was Etta. At the time of Helme's death Helmetta had a population of five hundred persons, and five factories employing over three hundred persons, many from Spotswood and Jamesburg. For ten years Helme was a member of the board of trustees of the State Reform School at Jamesburg and president of the board for eight years. His family was influential in establishing St. George's Episcopal Church in Helmetta. Death He died in 1893 in Helmetta, aged 71, of a heart attack. A special car of the Pennsylvania Railroad left Jersey City for the benefit of those wishing to attend the funeral services. The Camden Post (Camden, New Jersey) reported that 1,500 persons attended. The funeral procession of almost 500, some in horse-drawn carriages, some walking, made its way south to nearby Fernwood Cemetery in Jamesburg, where he was buried in the Helme Mausoleum, the largest in the cemetery, located on the highest point of ground. He was reported to have been the second wealthiest man in the state. He was survived by his wife and three children. A grandson was painter Henry Hyacinth Strater.

For such a field F, its Weil group is generally denoted WF. There also exists \\"finite level\\" modifications of the Galois groups: if E/F is a finite extension, then the relative Weil group of E/F is WE/F = WF/ (where the superscript c denotes the commutator subgroup). For more details about Weil groups see or or . Weil group of a class formation The Weil group of a class formation with fundamental classes uE/F ‚àà H2(E/F, AF) is a kind of modified Galois group, used in various formulations of class field theory, and in particular in the Langlands program. If E/F is a normal layer, then the (relative) Weil group WE/F of E/F is the extension :1 -> AF -> WE/F -> Gal(E/F) -> 1 corresponding (using the interpretation of elements in the second group cohomology as central extensions) to the fundamental class uE/F in H2(Gal(E/F), AF). The Weil group of the whole formation is defined to be the inverse limit of the Weil groups of all the layers G/F, for F an open subgroup of G. The reciprocity map of the class formation (G, A) induces an isomorphism from AG to the abelianization of the Weil group. Weil group of an archimedean local field For archimedean local fields the Weil group is easy to describe: for C it is the group C√ó of non-zero complex numbers, and for R it is a non-split extension of the Galois group of order 2 by the group of non-zero complex numbers, and can be identified with the subgroup C√ó ‚à™ j C√ó of the non-zero quaternions. Weil group of a finite field For finite fields the Weil group is infinite cyclic. A distinguished generator is provided by the Frobenius automorphism. Certain conventions on terminology, such as arithmetic Frobenius, trace back to the fixing here of a generator (as the Frobenius or its inverse). Weil group of a local field For a local field of characteristic p > 0, the Weil group is the subgroup of the absolute Galois group of elements that act as a power of the Frobenius automorphism on the constant field (the union of all finite subfields). For p-adic fields the Weil group is a dense subgroup of the absolute Galois group, and consists of all elements whose image in the Galois group of the residue field is an integral power of the Frobenius automorphism. More specifically, in these cases, the Weil group does not have the subspace topology, but rather a finer topology. This topology is defined by giving the inertia subgroup its subspace topology and imposing that it be an open subgroup of the Weil group. (The resulting topology is \\"locally profinite\\".) Weil group of a function field For global fields of characteristic p>0 (function fields), the Weil group is the subgroup of the absolute Galois group of elements that act as a power of the Frobenius automorphism on the constant field (the union of all finite subfields). Weil group of a number field For number fields there is no known \\"natural\\" construction of the Weil group without using cocycles to construct the extension. The map from the Weil group to the Galois group is surjective, and its kernel is the connected component of the identity of the Weil group, which is quite complicated. Weil‚ÄìDeligne group The Weil‚ÄìDeligne group scheme (or simply Weil‚ÄìDeligne group) W‚Ä≤K of a non- archimedean local field, K, is an extension of the Weil group WK by a one- dimensional additive group scheme Ga, introduced by . In this extension the Weil group acts on the additive group by : \\\\displaystyle wxw^{-1} = wx where w acts on the residue field of order q as a‚Üíaw with w a power of q. The local Langlands correspondence for GLn over K (now proved) states that there is a natural bijection between isomorphism classes of irreducible admissible representations of GLn(K) and certain n-dimensional representations of the Weil‚ÄìDeligne group of K. The Weil‚ÄìDeligne group often shows up through its representations. In such cases, the Weil‚ÄìDeligne group is sometimes taken to be WK √ó SL(2,C) or WK √ó SU(2,R), or is simply done away with and Weil‚ÄìDeligne representations of WK are used instead. In the archimedean case, the Weil‚ÄìDeligne group is simply defined to be Weil group.

The municipality was created in 1996 by a merger of Hauptwil and Gottshaus. The Wakker Prize was bestowed on Hauptwil in 1999 for the preservation of its architectural heritage. History Aerial view by Walter Mittelholzer (1923) Hauptwil was first mentioned in 1413 as Hoptwill. Gottshaus was first mentioned in the second half of the 13th Century. Hauptwil By no later than 1377 Hauptwil was part of the fief granted by the Bishop of Constance and the Abbey of St. Gall to Welter von Blidegg of the Ryff family. In 1561 it went to the Freiherr von Hallwyl. Then, between 1664 and 1798 it was owned by the Gonzenbach family, who by 1600 already owned several properties and held the low justice right in Hauptwil. The Catholic part of the population has always belonged to the parish of Bischofszell. Reformed services were held at the castle chapel by 1667 by the Gonzenbach family for the village. The Reformed chapel became a filial church to the parish church in Bischofszell in 1861. Then, in 1886 a Reformed church was built in the village. The Brunschweiler family, who owned a large factory in town, were active in the early 19th Century Evangelical Baptist movement, which they encouraged to grow in the town. In 1880 about 10% of the inhabitants belonged to this church, and currently there is still a Bund Freier Evangelischer Gemeinde (a type of free church) community in Hauptwil The Gonzenbach family had made their money in the textile industry, so after their arrival, the farming village evolved into a textile producing factory settlement. The industrialization was beneficial by providing wages and easy access to water power (five artificial ponds were built). In 1664 Hauptwil was given the right to hold a market. The Castle was built in 1664-65, and in 1661-71 approximately forty new manufacturing buildings and worker housing were built. At the end of the 18th Century the Brunschweiler family of Erlen settled in Hauptwil. During a stagnation in the textile industry, they built up the dyeing industry in the village. The opening of the railway line Sulgen- Gossau in 1876 further expanded the local economy. Next to the textile industry in importance, agriculture remained important in the village. Towards the end of the 19th Century, the village made the transition from orchards and crops to livestock and dairy farming. The first dairy was built in 1909. Since the Brunschweiler Dyeing Factory ceased operations in 1984, Zetag AG operates the only textile production factory in the area. The construction of single family homes in the 1970s stopped the emigration of families from Hauptwil. It is now characterized by well-preserved old buildings and the now converted industrial landscape of the 17th to 19th Centuries and in 1999 was awarded the Wakker Prize. Gottshaus The farms of Gottshaus were likely part of the grants given to the Abbey of St. Pelagius in Bischofszell in the 9th Century by the Bishop of Constance Salomo I/Solomon I. From the Middle Ages until 1798 Pelagi-Gottshaus formed a lower court in the bailiwick of Bischofszell. The chapel was built in 1486 and belonged to the parish of Bischofszell. In 1535, during the Counter-Reformation, it became a pilgrimage church. In 1726 it came under the authority of the monastery. In 1908 the eastern part of the municipality split off to form the Catholic community of St. Pelagiberg. A weir was built on the river in 1430 by the Abbey and served in the 17th-19th Centuries to provide the textile industry in Hauptwil with power. Since 1946 this weir has been under government protection and preservation. Agriculture is still the most important activity in the village. Geography Hauptwil- Gottshaus has an area, , of .

Though they weren't Supremes members, singers Sundray Tucker, Freddi Poole and Joyce Vincent have also sung with the group alongside Supremes members Payne, Laurence and Greene. Biography=Early years In 1985, eight years after the Supremes officially broke up in 1977, Scherrie Payne, was signed to SuperStar International Records, a Los Angeles based record company. Ronnie Phillips and SuperStar approached her with the idea of reforming the Supremes, to which she agreed, and called on former Supremes Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong. Wilson declined, instead opting to forge a solo career, while Birdsong agreed and coaxed former Supreme Jean Terrell to join the new Supremes group (By early 1976, was stated that Terrell and Birdsong would try to create a new group alongside original supreme Florence Ballard, but Ballard's sudden death cancelled their plans). The three of them set about forming a new incarnation of The Supremes, although due to contractual difficulties over the ownership of the name (Mary Wilson was involved in lengthy lawsuits with Motown over ownership and rights to the name) decided to create an entirely new group under the name \\"FLOS\\", The Former Ladies of the Supremes. Before the FLOS got off the ground, Birdsong left for a solo career; recording briefly for U.K. based Hi-Hat Records. Former Supreme Lynda Laurence joined the lineup, replacing Cindy Birdsong just as she had in 1972; and in 1986, the group was officially formed. The group released the song \\"We're Back\\", backed with \\"Getaway\\", as 12-inch versions. It featured all three ladies showcasing their vocals with a contemporary pop sound. Because SuperStar International Records did not have national distribution, the song failed to chart and the label soon folded. The group began touring around this time, making their debut at The Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles in 1987. Former Supreme Mary Wilson came along to show support to her former groupmates at this concert. Backing vocals at this concert were provided by Lynda's sister and soon-to-be group member, Sundray Tucker. Motorcity Records In 1989, the FLOS signed to British producer Ian Levine's Motorcity Records project, joining a roster of former Motown artists at the label. The first single by the FLOS on the new label was an original tune called \\"Crazy 'bout the Guy\\" (MOTC 13), released during that summer, and featuring Jean on lead vocals. This single, together with all releases by the group on the Motorcity Records label ran the credit as Jean, Scherrie & Lynda Formerly of The Supremes. The follow-up single was a re-make of the classic Supremes hit \\"Stoned Love\\" (MOTC 56) which saw Scherrie and Jean splitting lead vocal duties between one another. The single's b-side contained a live version of \\"Crazy 'bout the Guy\\". The next single was \\"I Want to Be Loved\\" (MOTC 77), showcasing the lead vocals of all three ladies; the b-side contained two remixes of the track. The final single for Motorcity, the Lynda-led \\"Hit & Miss\\" (MOTC 88), was released in 1991 and the ladies were credited as 'The Supremes'. Since then, all of their back catalogue of recordings made for Motorcity are marketed as just 'The Supremes'. The ladies also released a single with label-mates The Originals, an original tune called \\"Back By Popular Demand\\". An album called \\"Bouncing Back\\" was scheduled to be released, but the label ran into financial difficulties before it could come to fruition. The album eventually was released by various labels. One song scheduled for inclusion on the album was \\"How Do You Keep The Music Playing\\", which has since become a staple of the group's live act. Exit Jean, Enter Sundray The FLOS' lineup changed again, when in late December 1992, Jean Terrell left and was replaced by Lynda's sister Sundray Tucker. Sundray made her concert debut with the group in March 1993 when the group made another tour of the country. Several shows from the tour were recorded but have not been released. One track taken from this tour, \\"Sukiyaki\\", saw release on the limited edition album Something Special (produceed by Steve Weaver in 1998) which featured several tracks by the group, as well as solo tracks by both Lynda and Cindy Birdsong. In 1994, The FLOS released their first studio album with Sundray Tucker on board. The resulting album, Supreme Voices, featured all three ladies taking lead vocal duties. Scherrie, Lynda & Sundray shared lead vocals on three songs, \\"Give Me the Night\\", a remake of the George Benson classic hit; a remake of their 1970's Supremes hit, \\"Up The Ladder To The Roof\\", which featured guest vocals by former Supreme Cindy Birdsong; and \\"How Do You Keep The Music Playing\\". The following year another album produced by Steve Weaver was released entitled Supremely Yours. Following on the same format as the previous album, all three ladies would have equal number of lead vocals and they'd also share lead vocals on three songs \\"Stop to Love\\", \\"Feel Like Making Love\\" and another '70s Supremes classic \\"Touch\\". Steve recorded over 40 songs with the ladies, most of them now released. Later in the year of 1995, the ladies were invited to perform with Mel Carter at an engagement, which was recorded and released as 'Mel Carter: Live In Hollywood' and this was released as a CD and DVD. Exit Sundray, Enter Freddi Sundray remained with the group for four years, contributing to several albums and establishing herself with fans before being replaced by Freddi Poole. In 1996, Sundray left the trio and Jean Terrell made a brief comeback to the group, reuniting with both Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence for two special concerts held at the Industry Cafe in Los Angeles. This reunion coincided with the recruitment of Freddi Poole in July 1996. Poole, an established singer who had worked with the likes of Patti Labelle, Gladys Knight and Sammy Davis Jr., stayed with the group until September 2009. Exit Freddi, Enter Joyce On September 29, 2009, it was reported on Scherrie and Lynda's website that Freddi had left the group, later to join another female trio The Three Degrees. With Freddi's departure, Joyce Vincent Wilson of Tony Orlando and Dawn officially joined The Former Ladies. In a twist of fate, Vincent had once been considered a replacement in an official grouping of Supremes (after Mary Wilson's departure); iIt was later decided by Motown that the group should not continue without an original member, and the Supremes disbanded in 1977. Exit Lynda, Enter Susaye On October 6, 2017, it was reported via Facebook that after 31 years Lynda Laurence had departed the group to move into other areas of the music business and was replaced by former Motown Supreme Susaye Greene.https://www.facebook.com/flos.supremes/posts/10208645278643038 Greene was a member of The Supremes from early 1976 to summer of 1977 (replacing Cindy Birdsong), and performed on their last two albums, \\"High Energy\\" and \\"Mary, Scherrie & Susaye\\". Keeping the Music Playing ‚Äì Musical Highlights In 1996, Jean Terrell returned to the group for several \\"reunion\\" shows; this after the departure of Sundray Tucker. Eventually, Freddi Poole joined the group, and Jean departed once again. In 2000, Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence joined Diana Ross, and toured on the brief and later cancelled Return To Love tour. The Ladies made TV appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Today Show, VH1 Divas Live, and The View. In 2001, the FLOS recorded \\"Light the World (With the Flame of Love)\\" written by Scherrie and Lynda. The trio performed the anthem at the Small Country Olympics opening ceremony in Italy the same year. In 2005, the FLOS were honored by the Hollywood History Museum. The museum presented an exhibit showcasing the Ladies' contribution to The Supremes' legacy and their FLOS' history. Scherrie and Lynda donated stage gowns and shoes from their personal collection for the display along with photos, record albums, tour books, and posters. In July, 2006, \\"Sisters United (We're Taking Control)\\" was debuted at the group's twentieth anniversary concert at The Music Box in Hollywood. Scherrie and Lynda honored all of the Ladies who contributed to the recording and performing success of the Supremes (Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard, Cindy Birdsong, Jean Terrell, Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne, and Susaye Greene ‚Äì however they forgot to include Barbara Martin, an original member from the early years before the group's success). They presented the Ladies with personalized trophies. In attendance were former Supremes Cindy Birdsong and Susaye Greene, and former FLOS' member Sundray Tucker. In January 2009, Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence (with Poole) rang in the 2009 New Year in Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia. In August 2009, the Former Ladies released \\"Good Intentions\\", a song produced by Lynda's son Trevor Lawrence and written by Lynda's daughter in-law, Alicia Lawrence. In November, 2009, The Ladies performed in the Diva's of Motown show in the UK alongside Thelma Houston, Brenda Holloway, Mable John, Chris Clark and Jack Ashford's Funk Brothers In February, 2010, The Ladies performed at the Second Aid benefit concert for Hiati in Losa Angeles, CA. That same month Scherrie and Lynda were honored by the AV Black Chamber of Commerce for Black History Month. On June 21, 2017, shortly after sound check, Joyce became ill and was sent to the hospital. Scherrie and Lynda continued as a duo; this was the first time in over thirty years the group performed with just two members onstage. This would also be their last performance with Lynda. Forty Years Later; Fantasy Becomes Reality In 1977, when Mary Wilson departed the Supremes for a solo career, it was reported that Scherrie and Susaye would continue the group with a new third member. Scherrie and Susaye selected Joyce Vincent to round out the trio. Instead, Motown Records decided that without any original members, the Supremes would be disbanded. With Lynda's departure and the addition of Susaye, the \\"fantasy\\" line up of Scherrie, Susaye, and Joyce has now become reality.

Italian in etymology, it literally means \\"not finished\\". Non finito sculptures appear unfinished because the artist only sculpts part of the block, the figure sometimes appearing to be stuck within the block of material. It was pioneered by Donatello during the Renaissance and was also used by Michelangelo among others. The philosophic origins of non finito practice come from antiquity and the theories of Plato. Platonic philosophy states that any work of art, or otherwise, never completely resembles its heavenly counterpart. The act of leaving a work unfinished is sometimes a neo-Platonic homage to this. In the case of the ancient Romans, artists would sign their work with the verb faciebat (third-person singular imperfect active indicative of faci≈ç). This verb, following their name, would identify them as the artist, but the work as unfinished (non finito). Some artists, however, signed their work this way even if the work had been refined to the highest degree, as when Michelangelo famously signed his sculpture Piet√°, the only sculpture he ever signed.

He has served as Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security since 2014, and was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1996 until 2008, representing Northern Virginia's 46th district. Moran was a primary candidate for Governor of Virginia in 2009, hoping to succeed fellow Democrat Tim Kaine, but on June 9, 2009, he lost the Democratic Party nomination to Creigh Deeds, a member of the Virginia Senate. Early life Moran was born in Natick, Massachusetts, the youngest of seven children in a Catholic family of Irish descent. His father is former professional football player James Moran Sr.. At age 13, he took the train to Washington, D.C. to watch the Watergate hearings. Moran attended university at Framingham State College, and later the Catholic University of America, where he earned his Juris Doctor from the Columbus School of Law in 1988. Moran's older brother is Jim Moran, a former U.S. Congressman from Virginia's 8th district. The elder Moran helped raise funds for his brother during his gubernatorial campaign, and both represented areas in Northern Virginia, but the two have differing opinions on several issues such as gun control and parole laws. Politics Moran in 2007 After one year clerkship, Moran became an Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney for Arlington County. Moran spent seven years in the Commonwealth Attorney's office, working cases ranging up to rape and murder, before he ran for the House of Delegates in 1995 at the suggestion of Mark Warner. After being elected, Moran served on the Transportation, Courts of Justice, and Health Welfare and Institutions Committees. He is a repeat winner of Mothers Against Drunk Driving Legislator of the Year, a recipient of the Tech-10 award from the Northern Virginia Technology Council, and a Friend of Business awardee from the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce. Moran was named 2006 Legislator of the Year by the Virginia Sheriffs Association. He resigned his seat on December 12, 2008 to pursue the Virginia governorship full-time. In 2001, Moran was elected to chair the House Democratic Caucus, succeeding Creigh Deeds who was elected to the Virginia State Senate. During his tenure, Democrats added seats in every consecutive general election and ultimately held 44 of the chamber's 100 seats. Moran spent the better part of 2006 and 2007 traveling the state to recruit and support House candidates for the 2007 election, when all 100 Virginia House of Delegates seats were on the ballot (as in every other odd-numbered year). He formed a fundraising committee to campaign for governor in 2009. Mame Reiley served as director of Virginians for Brian Moran, helping Moran in his election bid for governor (from m 2007-09) but he lost the Democratic nomination for governor to Deeds, who received more than twice as many votes as Moran. Moran came in third, Terry McAuliffe second. On December 4, 2010, Moran was elected chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, defeating Peter Rousselot of Arlington County. In December 2013, Governor-elect Terry McAuliffe announced he was nominating Moran to serve as Virginia's next Secretary of Public Safety, which is the Cabinet position with supervision of the Virginia State Police, the state's alcoholic beverage control laws, the Virginia Department of Corrections, and the Virginia National Guard. Previous Secretaries of Public Safety have included former Virginia state Attorney General Jerry Kilgore and John W. Marshall.

The episode was first aired on August 21, 2006 in the United States. It is written by series creator Paul Scheuring and directed by Kevin Hooks, who directed the season finale of season one, \\"Flight\\". William Fichtner is introduced as a new regular cast member, whose character is assigned to track down the eight escapees from Fox River State Penitentiary. The role of Terrence Steadman was recast to Jeff Perry, who replaces John Billingsley as the brother of Caroline Reynolds (based on how little time the character was seen clearly, series creator Paul Scheuring jokingly questioned in interviews whether Billingsley had ever even been on the show to begin with). The episode's title refers to the subject of both the episode and the season as a whole; the statewide (which quickly becomes nationwide) manhunt for the Fox River 8. The series regular cast members who did not appear are Paul Adelstein (who plays Paul Kellerman) and Marshall Allman (who plays L. J. Burrows). Despite their roles as two of the eight prison escapees, the two recurring cast members Lane Garrison (who plays David \\"Tweener\\" Apolskis) and Silas Weir Mitchell (who plays Charles \\"Haywire\\" Patoshik) did not appear in this episode, though they did appear in brief flashbacks at the beginning of the episode. Plot Eight hours after the escape, Michael, Lincoln, Abruzzi, C-Note and Sucre eventually manage to elude Captain Bellick and his team with the help of a freight train. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agent Alexander Mahone is assigned to lead a nationwide search for the escapees, this makes their escape even more difficult, as Mahone calls a press conference, and urges everybody watching the television broadcast to find the \\"Fox River 8.\\" He also has a keen interest on Scofield, and wants to know everything about him. The escapees are found by a hunter, who attempts to turn them in. However, Abruzzi holds the hunter's young daughter hostage, and is able to get the hunter to drop his weapon, and gives Michael the keys to his Jeep Grand Cherokee. The five escapees board the SUV, en route to a storage room where Michael has some items ready. Meanwhile, Mahone and Bellick use Michael's credit card invoices to find a storage room in Oswego, and each separately rush to the storage facility. It turns out to be a ruse of Michael's, as he is seen in a cemetery storage room, gathering shovels to unearth the ground at the grave of (R.I.P.) E. Chance Woods. Agent Mahone deciphers the message on Michael's tattoo (\\"Ripe Chance Woods\\") and arrives at the scene right after the escaped gang of five unearthed Michael's package and put on a fresh set of clothing. Lincoln takes the backpack Michael hid and found the brothers' fake passports. The five are able to escape to Oswego and blend in, despite being tailed by Agent Mahone. Elsewhere, T-Bag finds a veterinary clinic of Dr. Marvin Gudat, and coerces him to reattach his left hand without the use of anesthesia. Dr. Sara Tancredi recovers from her drug overdose, and is interrogated by the FBI, who tells her that 8 prisoners escaped. After Nurse Katie's visit, Sara finds an origami swan inside her purse. Inside is a message \\"There's a plan to make all of this right\\", and a dotted code. The dot code on the origami swan that Sara found can be grouped into lines of numbers. The numbers are 3221243324 for the first line, 4221312231 for the second, and 23133121 for the third. Veronica discovers yet another secret from Terrence Steadman. He is being held captive, although somewhat willingly, inside the estate; the doors can be opened only from the outside, and the windows are bulletproof. Veronica receives a phone call from Lincoln after calling 911, and informs him of what she has learned. While she is on the phone with Lincoln, Company agents arrive and kill Veronica, where Lincoln could only listen and slips into grief.

The population was 21,991 at the 2011 census, of which 8,330 in the town proper. The Met√©ora monasteries are located near the town. Kalabaka is the northwestern terminal of the old Thessaly Railways, now part of OSE.  History  A Greek inscription on the wall of one of the town's oldest churches (Saint John the Baptist) testifies to the existence of an ancient Greek settlement under the name Aiginion. View of Meteora from Kastraki Panoramic view of the town Kalambaka railway station In the 10th century AD, it was known as Stagoi (Œ£œÑŒ±Œ≥ŒøŒØ), a Byzantine fortress and bishopric (the name is still in use for the town by the Greek Orthodox Church). Of its medieval monuments, only the cathedral, the Church of the Dormition, survives. It was a late 11th- or early 12th-century building, built on the remains of an earlier, late antique church. Relics of an ancient Greek temple ‚Äì probably of god Apollo ‚Äì have been incorporated in the wall of the town's oldest and most renowned church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Stagoi is first mentioned in Diatyposis written by the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise (886-912). In 1163 there was a reference to the castle of Stagoi. In 1204 Stagoi fell under the Despotate of Epirus. At the end of the 13th century they fell under the Duchy of Neopatria. In 1334, they were taken over once more by the Despot of Epirus, John II Orsini, and shortly thereafter they came once more under the control of the Byzantine Empire. In 1348, they were conquered by the Serbs of Stephen Dushan. They reached their peak under the rule of his brother, King Simeon Uro≈°. When the Ottomans conquered Thessaly, Kalabaka was placed under the administrative rule of the Pasha of Larisa and later on of the Sanjak of Trikala. It was named \\"Kalabaka\\" six or seven centuries ago. It is of Turkish origin and means \\"powerful fortress\\". It has been Anglicized variously as Kalampaka, Kalambaka or Kalabaki. Bishopric history From the beginning of the 10th century, Stagoi was referred to as an episcopal see, thereby enjoying privileges and donations from the Byzantine emperors throughout the Middle Ages. It owned significant stretches of land and had dependent farmers in neighboring settlements. Besides the fields of northwest Thessaly, its territory included an extensive mountainous zone in Asia and central Pindos. The bishopric of Stagoi, a suffragan of the Metropolis of Larissa, was maintained, with some small intermissions, up to 1900 when it was merged with the bishopric of Tricca to form the Metropolis of Tricca and Stagoi with the town of Trikala as its seat. It was reestablished in 1991, and has been operating ever since as the Metropolis of \\"Stagoi and Meteora\\" with its seat in the town of Kalabaka. Province The province of Kalabaka () was one of the provinces of the Trikala Prefecture. It had the same territory as the present municipality. It was abolished in 2006. Transport The city is served by Kalambaka station on the Palaiofarsalos-Kalambaka line. Geography and demographics The town is situated at the foot of the Meteora peaks. It is inhabited by an important native-indigenous community of Greek Vlachs.

Often used in horror movies to inspire dread of what one is watching, this shot-framing incorporates a few techniques for effect. First, there is a clear sense of distance between the viewpoint and the subject. Often cover is shown on the screen to demonstrate that the stalker is hiding. Another aspect of stalker vision is that it usually shows an everyday action that is not usually public. Also, one of the mainstays of stalker vision is that the victim is watched over a period of time. Often Telescopes, binoculars, or other observation equipment are combined with a tree stand or some other place of watching. Stalker vision often features a fairly helpless target, usually the female protagonist or a child in a horror movie. This tendency of the stalker or monster to prey upon the weak is used to create hatred and dislike for the viewer, and worry for the victim.

It is located northwest of Anadyr, the administrative center of the autonomous okrug. With a population of 5,506 as of the 2010 Census, and an estimated population as of 1 January 2015 of 5,592, it is the second largest town in the autonomous okrug after Anadyr. Geography Aerial view of Bilibino The town of Bilibino was built at the confluence of the Karalveyem and Bolshoy Keperveyem Rivers (Kolyma's basin). Bilibino is on the transition zone between the conifer forest and the tundra of the East Siberian Mountains, southeast of the Pyrkanay Range (–ì–æ—Ä—ã –ü—ã—Ä–∫–∞–Ω–∞–π), southwest of the Rauchuan Range (–†–∞—É—á—É–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ö—Ä–µ–±–µ—Ç) and north of the Kyrganay Range and the Chuvan Mountains. –ß—É–≤–∞–Ω–∞–π—Å–∫–∏–µ –≥–æ—Ä—ã, National atlas of Russia History As with much of the rest of Chukotka, the earliest human remains found in the region around Bilibino have been dated to the Early Neolithic, with camp sites having been excavated at Orlovka 2, a site on the banks of the Orlovka River, as well as at Lakes Tytyl and Ilirney.Petit Fute. Chukotka, p. 100 Interest in the area around the present day site of the town began in the 1920s when prospectors including Soviet geologist Yuri Bilibin (1901‚Äî1952) discovered gold in the region and began to make assessments regarding the commercial viability of its extraction.Petit Fute. Chukotka, pp. 102f In March 1955, gold mining operations commenced and the construction of a settlement started,Official website of Bilibinsky District. General Description of the Town of Bilibino though at this stage it was little more than a collection of geologists' and prospectors' tents, who had originally been based in Seymchan. Because of his discovery of gold in the region, particularly within the vicinity of the Bolshoy Anyuy and Maly Anyuy Rivers, the geologists named the new settlement after Yury Bilibin, and the new name was officially adopted in February 1956. On September 6, 1958, Bilibino was granted urban-type settlement status. Bilibino's development intensified in the early 1960s when it was joined to the Pevek power grid. On August 2, 1961, Bilibino became the administrative center of the Eastern Tundra District (Rayon Vostochnoy Tundry) which was renamed Bilibino District (Bilibinsky Rayon) on the occasion. In 1965, the Soviet government decided to build the Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant. The construction aided by several hundred volunteers from the Komsomol organization was completed in 1974; by 1976 three additional reactors were put into operation.Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP). Nuclear Transparency in the Asia Pacific. Bilibino Power Station Town status was granted to Bilibino on June 28, 1993. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Bilibino serves as the administrative center of Bilibinsky District,Law #33-OZ to which it is directly subordinated.Directive #517-rp As a municipal division, the town of Bilibino is, together with the selo of Keperveyem, incorporated within Bilibinsky Municipal District as Bilibino Urban Settlement.Law #43-OZ Economy The town is home to the world's northernmost nuclear power plant, the Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant, which opened in January 1974. It is the only nuclear power plant in the Russian Far East and has four reactors, each with an output of 12 MWe. The plant will be progressively shut down and decommissioned, and will be replaced by the Akademik Lomonosov floating nuclear power plant. The first reactor was shut down at the end of 2018. The nearest operating gold mine is located west of the town. Transportation The region where Bilibino is located has virtually no roads that are usable year-round; even a trip from the Keperveyem Airport to Bilibino town requires a journey along an unpaved road. There is also an unpaved road to the seaport of Zelyony Mys on the Kolyma River near Chersky in the Sakha Republic (around 250 km). Heavier transports use this road. There is a winter-only ice road between Pevek and Bilibino. Demographics In a typical development for the post-Soviet era in the Russian Far East, Bilibino's population dropped significantly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. During the 1989 Soviet Census, the population of Bilibino was 15,558; it fell to 6,181 in the 2002 Census and further down to 5,506 in the 2010 Russian Census. As of January 2010, the ethnic make up of the town was mostly Russians (71%) and Ukrainians (15%); Chukchi people and Evens accounted for 6% and 3%, correspondingly; with all other ethnicities accounting for less than 1% each. Climate Bilibino has a subarctic climate (Dfc) according to the K√∂ppen climate classification.McKnight and Hess, pp. 232‚Äì235 Summers are mild with chilly nights, while winters are dry and bitterly cold.

She knew people in the music business who asked her to record her first CD. She wrote several songs, among them \\"Te Amo\\", \\"C√≥mo Dejarte\\" and \\"Mi Primer D√≠a sin Ti\\". In 2001, thanks to Iv√°n Corredor Julio Navarra's agency, Sandoval participated in \\"Miss Mi√©rcoles\\", winning second position. Later, she got into television working in the local channel Telebarranquilla in a program called Entre la Rubia y la Morena. In television On her 16th birthday, after having finished secondary school, Sandoval and her mother went to the Colombian capital to pursue her dream of being a singer. One day she met Iv√°n Ramirez in a recording studio, who asked to represent her. She accepted, and just a short time later he sent her to be cast in the protagonist role in the series Al Ritmo de tu Coraz√≥n. When the producers of RCN TV saw her in the series, they proposed casting her for a role in Los Reyes. For this casting Sandoval tried several roles, and finally landed the role of \\"Maria\\". Sandoval prepared with Rub√©n di Pietro, and a month later the telenovela's production started. Los Reyes became a hit in Colombia reaching a 43.6% rating (comparable level to Betty la Fea). Its shooting schedule, however, became long and debilitating (at two episodes a day) causing several actors to leave, among them Sandoval who, aside from the hours dedicated to the soap opera (7:00 to 22:00 either the more) had to be studying English until 4:00. In March 2006, Sandoval traveled to Mexico to audition for the Televisa series C√≥digo Postal, and became the first Colombian actress to star in Mexican television next to Ver√≥nica Castro. She was given the role of \\"Regina Corona\\". The series ran until October 2006. Singing career In February 2007, she went to Puerto Rico to begin musical production with White Lion Records, her producer being El√≠as de L√©on, and has traveled between Puerto Rico and Bogota. Since the beginning of 2008 she has been in Miami finishing her music recording with Universal Records and learning English at the University of Miami. In early 2011, Jery was invited to travel to New York and appear as a guest on the Dcan Guff songs \\"Ella\\" and \\"Todito De Ti\\".

Early life Born Robert Michael Phillips, he is the son of Dr. Robert Warren Phillips and Dr. Irma Phillips who lived, although only briefly, in Valley Stream, New York. A few months after his birth his parents returned to his mother's native Puerto Rico, living in San Juan. Three years later they returned to the U.S., living for two years in Brooklyn, New York and then moving to Deer Park, New York. He attended Sts. Cyril and Methodius Catholic school and then Seton Hall High School. Music career=Education Phillips began his musical training at age 8 on the accordion. He began to teach himself the guitar at age 12. He did not work with a teacher until 1967, when he began to learn finger-style folk guitar. After taking lessons for a year, he studied classical guitar at the suggestion of his teacher. In 1971, he entered Hofstra University as a Music Education major, studying under Stanley Solow. After graduating in 1975, Phillips began studies in New York under Jos√© Rey de la Torre. In 1976, Rey left New York for San Francisco, and Phillips worked on his own for the next two years. In 1977, after attending a three-week seminar and master class under the direction of Guido Sant√≥rsola and Carlos Barbosa-Lima, Phillips began to study on a more or less regular basis with Barbosa-Lima. In 1979, Phillips decided that a more regular regimen of study was desirable, and he studied briefly with Dennis Koster. Soon after, he returned to school at Brooklyn College in order to earn a master's degree. He studied first with David Starobin and then with Michael Cedric Smith. Phillips graduated with an master's degree 1982. Although he did play in master classes, most notably by Eduardo Fernandez, Phillips did not return to formal education until 1999, when he entered the University of Miami. Under the instruction of Rene Gonzalez, he earned a Doctor of Musical Arts. While at the University of Miami, he also had the opportunity to perform in a master class given by Sergio Assad. Performing and recording He made his New York recital debut at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall on October 31, 1987.Crutchfield 1987 In 1991 he released his first album, Guitarre Nouveau, which included works by Philip Glass, Frank Martin, Eberhard Weber, and Thelonious Monk, as well as his own compositions.Bert 1991 In 1996 he released a 2-CD set, Great Themes and Variations for Classic Guitar as a companion to his anthology of the same name. His next recording wasn't until 2014 when he released the complete solo guitar works of Miguel Llobet in a recording entitled, Lo Mestre, the Music of Miguel Llobet Reinstetlethe 2014 He performs as a solo recitalist, ensemble player, and guest soloist. He has premiered works by Alfred Giusto, Frank Brazinski, Eric Ross, as well as the \\"Pipedream Sonata\\" by Meyer Kupferman, which Phillips commissioned Fabian and the Goyescana Concerto for guitar and orchestra by Michael Colina which he also commissioned and premiered in 2008.Gherman 2008 In 2016 Phillips embarked on a commissioning project, enlisting six Central Florida based composers to each create a new work for solo guitar in a dance rhythm. The composers that participated in the project were Troy Gifford, Jorge Morel, Benoit Glazer, Charles Griffin, all from Orlando, Howard J. Buss from Lakeland, Florida, and Rex Willis from Sarasota.Griffin 2017 Writing In 1983 Phillips worked briefly as an editorial assistant on the staff of Guitar Review. In 1989 he began writing a monthly classical guitar column in the rock-oriented guitar magazine, Guitar for the Practicing Musician, and its more general sister publication, the quarterly, Guitar Extra. In 1992 Cherry Lane Music discontinued the publication of Guitar Extra, and dropped his classical guitar column in Guitar for the Practicing Musician. Phillips went on to write several short \\"lessons\\" for Guitar Player magazine. He also contributed articles to Soundboard, the quarterly publication of the Guitar Foundation of America, and to American String Teacher, the journal of the American String Teachers Association. In 1996, he published Great Themes and Variations for Classic Guitar (Mel Bay), and released his second recording, a companion to the book. His doctoral dissertation is entitled, The Influence of Miguel Llobet on the Pedagogy, Repertoire, and Stature of the Guitar in the Twentieth Century( 2002, OCLC 51796355). It was while researching his dissertation, and on the advice of guitar scholars Ron Purcell and Angelo Gilardino that Phillips sought and found a complete archive of Llobet. His discovery of this missing archive was documented in his article, \\"Barcelona, Cradle of the Modern Classical Guitar: the Llobet Archive Rediscovered\\", Soundboard XXVIII, no. 4, 2002.Phillips 2002 Teaching Phillips began teaching guitar, music appreciation, and music theory at All Saints' Academy in 1995, and went on to become the chair of the performing arts department until 2008. In 2008, while continuing his duties as an instructor at All Saints' Academy, he began teaching guitar at Polk State College and Southeastern University. In 2010 he left All Saints' Academy, and accepted a position teaching classical guitar at Lois Cowles Harrison Center for the Visual and Performing Arts. Video In 1983 Phillips appeared in a series of instructional videos entitled \\"Classical Guitar Made Easy\\" which was broadcast on Group W Cable. Following the series, he began to produce and host a monthly talk show on Group W. The talk show, which was called \\"Long Island Sounds\\" featured interviews and performances of Long Island-based musicians. The show ran for three years, after which Phillips changed the trajectory of his efforts, not returning to video for nearly three decades. In 2011, taking advantage of new technology and relatively inexpensive production costs, Robert produced and recorded a series of videos of himself performing standards from the classical guitar repertory. Many of these performances were recorded in interesting locations, with the settings of some being almost as much of a feature as the music. Locations included the Museum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg, Florida), and the Frank Lloyd Wright Danforth Chapel at the Florida Southern College Child of the Sun. These videos were to be bundled together as \\"video albums\\", consisting of compositions that were thematically related. The first of these, \\"A Spanish Recital\\", consisted of works by Isaac Alb√©niz, Enrique Granados, Miguel Llobet, Francisco T√°rrega, and Federico Moreno Torroba. In 2015 Phillips began to produce \\"A Year of the Guitar\\", a video diary in which he chronicled his daily relationship with the instrument. The entries include performances of pieces, study guides for learning pieces, insights into his own daily practice, and instructional materials. These videos were published on the internet in Phillips' YouTube channel with a series of instructional videos.

Entrance to the park is via Waterford Bridge Road, passing a sculptured duck pond and a Peter Pan statue.  History  The land that Bowring Park currently occupies was originally a farm owned by William Thorburn known as Rae Island. The land was purchased and donated to the city in 1911 by Sir Edgar Rennie Bowring on behalf of Bowring Brothers Ltd. on their 100th anniversary of commerce in Newfoundland. Frederick Todd created the design and Rudolph Cochius was the landscape architect for the original section of the park. The park was officially opened by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught on July 15, 1914. The park has expanded to incorporate some of the surrounding areas. The original tract of land was on the east side of the park. In the 1970s the park acquired of land that once belonged to Sir Richard Squires, known as Midstream. The boundary between the old and new sections of the park is the pedestrian footbridge near the swimming pool. The bridge design and planning for the new section was completed by the noted modernist architect, Blanche Lemco van Ginkel in collaboration with Arup Partners. She presented her designs at the 1959 CIAM congress in Otterlo, Netherlands. Attractions The park has many recreation facilities, including tennis courts, a swimming pool and playground. There are a number of statues in the park, including two sculptures by Basil Gotto, one a Caribou and the other The Fighting Newfoundlander. The Caribou is a replica of the monument at the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial Park and was presented to the park by Major William Howe Green, a cousin of Sir Edgar Bowring. The Fighting Newfoundlander, a tribute to the Royal Newfoundland Regiment with Corporal Thomas Pittman as the subject, was also a gift from Sir Edgar Bowring. The statue was unveiled by Sir William Horwood in September 1922. Peter Pan Statue, St. John's, Canada The Peter Pan was erected in memory of Sir Edgar Bowring's godchild, Betty Munn, who had drowned along with her father at the sinking of at Cappahayden. The statue was unveiled on August 29, 1925 with the following inscription; > In memory of a little girl who loved the Park.

Most of his works were adaptations of European plays, and many became successful enough to tour throughout the English-speaking world. He is, however, perhaps best remembered today as the librettist of several comic operas, notably Haddon Hall. Life and career Grundy was born in Manchester, England, the son of Alderman Charles Sydney Grundy. He was educated at Owens College, Manchester, and studied law at the Middle Temple. He was called to the bar in 1869 and practised law until 1876. Early career His early one-act farce, A Little Change, was produced at the Haymarket Theatre in 1872 by the Kendals. This was followed by All at Sea in 1873, also starring the Kendals. In 1876, Grundy published The Days of His Vanity. He wrote Mammon for W. H. Vernon at the Strand Theatre in 1877 and After Long Years for the Folly Theatre in 1879. Early comedies included The Glass of Fashion (1882), The Silver Shield (1885), and the blank verse Clito for Wilson Barrett (1886). Scene from Grundy and Sullivan's Haddon Hall Grundy became well known as an adapter of French and German plays, cleaning them up for British audiences and revisiting the source material to craft his final product. As the protagonist in his 1900 play, A Debt of Honour, explains: \\"It all takes place in Paris: nobody pretends that such things happen here.\\" Among his earlier successes at adapting European works were The Snowball at the Strand Theatre (1879), based on Oscar, ou le mari qui trompe sa femme by Eug√®ne Scribe and Duvergne; In Honour Bound (1880), based on Scribe's Une Chaine; Dust at the Royalty Theatre (1881); The Glass of Fashion (1883); and A Wife's Sacrifice (1886). The Bells of Haslemere, written with H. Pettitt, was a success at the Adelphi Theatre in 1887.

Later years In 1889‚Äì90 Grundy produced three original comedies, A White Lie at the Court Theatre, A Wife's Sacrifice and A Fool's Paradise at the Gaiety Theatre, which had been produced two years earlier as The Mouse-Trap. Later successful adaptations included A Pair of Spectacles at the Garrick Theatre (1889, starring John Hare), from Les Petits Oiseaux of Labiche and Delacour. In 1890, Lilly Langtry presented Grundy's Esther Sandraz at the St. James's Theatre. This was followed by A Village Priest at the Haymarket Theatre (1890), from Le Secret de la terreuse (called The Broken Seal in America) a melodrama by Busnach and Cauvin; Sowing the Wind at the Comedy Theatre (1893); An Old Jew at the Garrick (1894); an adaptation of Octave Feuillet's Montjoye, called A Bunch of Violets at the Haymarket (1894); The New Woman (1894); The Slaves of the Ring (1894); and The Greatest of These at the Garrick with the Kendals (1895).

A newspaper in the foreground has an article about the new speed limit.

On December 4, the Texas Highway Commission, with a 3‚Äì0 vote, adopted this speed limit, citing unsafe speed differentials between the flow of traffic and people driving too slowly to comply with Nixon's and Briscoe's requests for voluntary slowdowns. The legality of the measure was questioned, and two Texas legislators threatened to sue to block the limit. By December 6, Texas Attorney General John Hill ruled that the speed reduction \\"'was in excess' of the commissioners' legal power,\\" citing that a 1943 Texas Attorney General's opinion held that the legislature holds the power to set the statewide speed limit and the Commission's authority was limited to changing it in specific locales where safety factors required lower limits. As an emergency response to the 1973 oil crisis, on November 26, 1973, President Richard Nixon proposed a national speed limit for passenger vehicles and a 55 mph (90 km/h) speed limit for trucks and buses. Also proposed were a ban on ornamental lighting, no gasoline sales on Sunday, and a 15% cut in gasoline production to reduce total gas consumption by 200,000 barrels a day, representing a 2.2% drop from annualized 1973 gasoline consumption levels. Nixon partly based that on a belief that cars achieve maximum efficiency between and that trucks and buses were most efficient at . The California Trucking Association, the largest trucking association in the United States, opposed differential speed limits on grounds that they are \\"not wise from a safety standpoint.\\" Enactment The Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act was a bill in the U.S. Congress that enacted the National Maximum Speed Law. States had to agree to the limit if they desired to receive federal funding for highway repair. The uniform speed limit was signed into law by Nixon on January 2, 1974, and became effective 60 days later, by requiring the limit as a condition of each state receiving highway funds, a use of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The legislation required speed limits on all four-lane divided highways unless the road had a lower limit before November 1, 1973. In some cases, like the New York Thruway, the speed limit had to be raised to comply with the law. The law capped speed limits at on all other roads. A survey by the Associated Press found that, as of Wednesday, January 2, 1974: *12 states already had maximum speed limits of . *9 states had maximum speed limits of . *29 states had lower limits. That includes some states that voluntarily lowered their limits in advance of the federal requirement.

Both during the time the law was enacted and after it was repealed, automobile fatalities decreased, which was widely attributed mainly to automobile safety improvements, owing to an increase in the safety of cars themselves, and the passage of mandatory seat belt legislation by all states except New Hampshire from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. \\"Traffic Safety Facts 2012: Occupant Protection.\\" DOT HS 811892.

Later, the National Academies wrote that there is \\"a strong link between vehicle speed and crash severity [which] supports the need for setting maximum limits on high-speed roads\\" but that \\"the available data do not provide an adequate basis for precisely quantifying the effects that changes in speed limits have on driving speeds, safety, and travel time on different kinds of roads.\\" The Academies report also noted that on rural interstates, the free-flowing traffic speed should be the major determinant of the speed limit: \\"Drivers typically can anticipate appropriate driving speeds.\\" This is due, in part, to the strong access control in these areas but also is an acknowledgement of the difficulty of enforcing the 55 mph (90 km/h) speed limit in these areas. A Cato Institute report showed that the safety record worsened in the first few months of the new speed limits, suggesting that the fatality drop found by the NRC was a statistical anomaly that regressed to the mean by 1978. After the oil crisis abated, the NMSL was retained mainly due to the possible safety aspect.\\"Statement on Signing the Federal-Aid Highway Amendments of 1974,\\" President Gerald R.

Several states immediately reverted to already existing laws. For example, most Texas rural limits that were above in 1974 immediately reverted to 70mph (110km/h), causing some legal confusion before the new signs were posted. Montana reverted to non-numerical speed limits on most rural highways, but its legislature adopted as a limit in 1999; as a result, according to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety researcher Anne McCartt, \\"What's impressive is the huge drop in the percent of vehicles going very fast....

Wilhelm Grosz was born in Vienna. He studied music with Richard Robert, Franz Schreker and Guido Adler. In 1921 he was appointed conductor of the Mannheim Opera, but returned to Vienna in 1922, where he worked as a pianist and composer. From 1927 he was the artistic manager of the Ultraphone Gramophone company in Berlin. In 1933 he became conductor of the Kammerspiele Theater in Vienna. Forced to flee his native land because of the Nazi takeover, Grosz resettled in England in 1934. However, he found little interest there for his avant garde musical style. He was able to apply a considerable melodic gift to setting the lyrics of popular songs, some of which became international successes. Most of his most popular titles were written with lyricist Jimmy Kennedy: \\"Harbour Lights\\", \\"Red Sails in the Sunset\\", \\"When Budapest Was Young\\", and \\"Isle of Capri\\". Grosz's classical compositions include three operas, two ballets, incidental music for three plays, scores for a number of films, orchestral works, a Symphonic Dance for piano and orchestra, chamber music, piano pieces and songs. Afrika-Songs, a song cycle for two vocal soloists and chamber ensemble, was first performed in 1930. It utilizes texts by Afro-American poets, mainly Langston Hughes, and a strongly blues-flavored sound. Both Afrika-Songs and a selection of the pop tunes, along with other of Grosz's works, were recorded in the mid-1990s by Decca Records, as part of their series called Entartete Musik (subtitled \\"Music Suppressed By the Third Reich\\").

The best known examples are found in Solnhofen limestone near Solnhofen, Bavaria, Germany. Originally assigned to the living genus Limulus, they are related to and look virtually identical to the modern horseshoe crab. Other species assigned to Mesolimulus have been recorded from Spain, Siberia and (questionably) from Lebanon. Kouphichnium Mesolimulus walchi fossil and track The unusual trackways left by these animals at Solnhofen were originally thought to have been made by birds or pterosaurs, since they included a cross-shaped marking comparable with the impression of a typical bird foot. Eventually they were correctly identified as arthropod footprints and named Kouphichnium walchi, as proved by some remarkable 'death traces' showing a Mesolimulus circling round on itself before dying. The last leg of more advanced horseshoe crabs is modified into a so-called 'pusher' which consists of four plates at the tip which push against the soft sediment rather like a snow-shoe. This was what left the unusual bird-like footprints. These creatures were thought to have hunted at night due to the characteristic footprints and preyed on small ground insects and certain foliage. Mesolimulus walchi Horseshoe crabs in general date to the Ordovician Period, more than 440 million years ago, and late Paleozoic Euproops fossils indicate that they have changed little over the last 300 million years. Fossils preserved in Solenhofen limestone are unusual because soft body parts and skeletons are clearly represented. References * Caster, K. E. 1941.

Located on the south side of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, it is part of the Sheboygan Area School District. The school has a rivalry with the cross-town Sheboygan North High School. The school opened in 1960 in the midst of a population shift toward the south side of Sheboygan and the Town of Wilson. It was a replacement for the former Sheboygan Central High School (established in 1884 as Sheboygan High School, renamed to Central High School in 1938), located in the city's downtown, which remains the site of the school district's offices and the site of several alternative programs. The school has undergone two expansions. In 1998, a new library and classrooms were added, and a more significant expansion occurred in 2005-2006, with the addition of more classrooms, a new indoor athletic complex, and new tennis courts. Naming rights for the school's new gymnasium were acquired by Acuity Insurance, with the weight room/fitness center being sponsored by Aurora Health Care and open to use by the public outside of school hours. In June 2017, after the school's office facilities moved to the southern part of the building, its address was officially changed to 1240 Washington Avenue, ending 57 years of holding the 3128 South 12th Street address. In the recent past, the Acuity Gymnasium played host to a private Fifth Harmony concert on March 19, 2014 sponsored by Milwaukee radio station WXSS and won by South High students in a school spirit contest involving clothing donations to Goodwill Industries. It also played host to a Bernie Sanders rally for his 2016 presidential campaign on April 1 of that year. The school's athletic teams are nicknamed the Redwings, with the school colors being red, white and black. Until 1993 the nickname was the Redmen, carried over from Central. When concerns over the racial implications of the Native American name were broached, a long debate among students, faculty, alumni and the community at large resulted in a change, one of the first in the state of Wisconsin to be settled long before the May 2010 implementation of a state law allowing easier challenges of Native American nicknames (later repealed in 2013), and one of the first computer-designed high school logos in the pre- Internet age of desktop publishing. One remnant of the former Redmen name still exists in a mosaic profile of an Indian chief on the front facade of the school's auditorium. The school's newspaper and yearbook are named Lake Breeze, a carryover from Central High School. Three members of the faculty hold National Board of Teaching Certification.

His nickname \\"≈ûeker\\" meant \\"sugar\\" in Turkish, which he earned due to his very easy-going nature.  Biography  Born in √úsk√ºdar, Istanbul he entered medical school in 1855, then transferred to the military academy. Here, he showed an interest in painting, his medical and military experience having aroused an interest in anatomy and perspective. Sultan Abd√ºlaziz liked his work and sent him to Paris immediately after S√ºleyman Seyyid, to study under Gustave Boulanger and Jean- L√©on G√©r√¥me. He spent seven years of study in France, and had an exhibition of his oil paintings in Paris in 1869. He returned to Istanbul in 1871, with a military rank of Captain. In 1873, with the assistance of the French painter, Pierre-D√©sir√© Guillemet, he organized and presented one of the first art exhibits in Istanbul. \\"≈ûeker\\" Ahmed Pasha advanced rapidly in military rank. In 1876, he was promoted to Major, in 1877 Lieutenant Colonel, in 1880 Colonel, in 1885 Brigadier General, and, finally, in 1890 to Lieutenant General. In 1896 he was placed in charge of official military protocol. \\"≈ûeker\\" Ahmed Pasha is one of the most important examples of the Ottoman military painters. He painted nature-related subjects such as forests, fruits, flowers, and animals with great skill. His life and art reflects the experience of Ottoman elites in the aftermath of the Tanzimat reform movement, which sought to learn more of Western culture, with the intent of either emulating it or blending it with traditional Ottoman patterns. Pasha was an example of such emulation and blending in the field of painting. He died on May 5, 1907, of a heart attack, and is buried in Ey√ºp Cemetery in Istanbul.

He is a former president of the University of California (2008-2013), former chancellor of the University of Texas System (2002‚Äì2008), and former president of the University of Minnesota (1997‚Äì2002). In addition to his position as Chancellor at The University of Texas, Yudof held the Charles Alan Wright Chair in Federal Courts at the University of Texas School of Law. Previously, he was a faculty member and administrator at The University of Texas at Austin for 26 years, serving as dean of the School of Law from 1984 to 1994 and as the University's executive vice president and provost from 1994 to 1997. Early life Born in Philadelphia to parents of Ukrainian Jewish descent, Yudof was raised in West Philadelphia. Yudof's father worked as an electrician. Yudof earned his B.A. cum laude in political science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1965 and LL.B. cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law in 1968. Legal and academic career (1971‚Äì1984) Yudof joined the faculty of The University of Texas School of Law in 1971. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of Michigan Law School and UC Berkeley School of Law. Yudof is a recognized expert in the fields of constitutional law, freedom of expression, and education law. He was co-counsel for the plaintiffs in the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case San Antonio v. Rodriguez, the landmark school finance lawsuit. He is the author of Gender Justice (with David L. Kirp and Marlene Franks), (Chicago Press, 1986; Paperback, 1987) and of When Government Speaks: Politics, Law, and Government Expression in America, (The University of California Press, 1983). Yudof became a member of the State Bar of Texas in 1980. University administration career=Dean of the University of Texas School of Law (1984‚Äì1994) From 1984 to 1994, Yudof served as dean of the University of Texas School of Law. Executive vice president and provost of the University of Texas at Austin (1994‚Äì1997) From 1994 to 1997, Yudof served as executive vice president and provost of the University of Texas at Austin. In that position, Yudof initiated many improvements to undergraduate education, including creating a freshman seminar program and Academy of Distinguished Teachers. President of the University of Minnesota (1997‚Äì2002) On July 1, 1997, Yudof took office as the 14th president of the University of Minnesota. In his first year as president, Yudof took advantage of a state budget surplus to fund construction projects, historic preservation, and academic priorities at the university. Yudof helped to establish freshman seminars. In 1999 the university moved from a quarter to semester system. The university encountered scandal in 1999 after the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported that an academic counseling staffer at Minnesota claimed to have done coursework for many student-athletes on the Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball program over the past five years, as well as several other NCAA rules violations by Minnesota basketball. Yudof oversaw self-imposed sanctions on the men's basketball program. Those sanctions included a $1.5 million buyout of the contract of head coach Clem Haskins, a postseason ban for the 1999‚Äì2000 season, and scholarship reductions. The scandal led to the resignations of men's athletic director Mark Dienhart and university vice president McKinley Boston. Members of the university board of regents praised Yudof for his handling of the scandal. By 2002, Yudof united men's and women's athletics at Minnesota under a single athletic director. In 2002, a six-story apartment-style hall was built at the University of Minnesota and was named Riverbend Commons and then subsequently renamed after Mark G. Yudof. It is currently referred to as Yudof or Yudof Hall. Chancellor of the University of Texas System (2002‚Äì2008) Yudof became the ninth chancellor of the University of Texas System on August 1, 2002. Simultaneously, he was president emeritus at the University of Minnesota and Charles Alan Wright Chair in Federal Courts at the University of Texas School of Law. As University of Texas System chancellor, Yudof allowed individual campuses to set their own tuition rates. He resigned on June 15, 2008 to become President of the University of California system. President of the University of California (2008‚Äì2013) In March 2008, Yudof was selected as the next president of UC, to succeed Robert C. Dynes. He began his term on June 16, 2008. In November 2009, TIME Magazine recognized Mark Yudof as one of the \\"10 Best College Presidents\\", citing his efforts to provide opportunity and access to a quality education for California residents with financial need whose family income is less than $60,000. In January 2013, Yudof announced his plan to resign as president of the University of California, effective August 31, 2013. = California budget crisis = The California budget crisis resulted in massive cuts to higher education by the California State Legislature and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Struggling to grapple with the ensuing crisis, California legislative leaders cut more than 20 percent from the UC budget in one year - the largest budgetary reduction in the history of the UC. In a July 9 \\"Open Letter to UC alumni and friends,\\" UC Regent Richard Blum; Russell Gould, then-chair; Sherry Lansing, then-vice chair; and UC president Yudof wrote, > \\"The UC model ‚Äî providing universal access to a top-notch, low-cost > education and research of the highest caliber ‚Äî continues to be studied > around the globe among those who would emulate its success. And yet, this > model has been increasingly abandoned at home by a state government > responsible for its core funding.\\" As state budgetary support declined dramatically, Yudof kicked off an online grassroots advocacy effort in order to make the case for the University of California. In 2008, Yudof became the first president of a major research university to organize advocacy efforts using email, blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media components. Yudof called on all students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends to unite behind an aggressive push to make funding UC a state priority. In 2009, Yudof further bolstered this effort through a campaign seeking to let legislators and the governor know how critical their support is in preserving the university's commitment to quality and student access.UC Newsroom http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/22360 Also in 2009, Yudof came under criticism for an interview that he gave to Deborah Solomon of the New York Times, Big Man on Campus, in which he joked about taking a pay cut from his salary of over $800,000 to $400,000 in exchange for the White House and Air Force One. =Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan = In February 2009,UC Announces Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/19471/ upon President Yudof's recommendation, the University of California Board of Regents unanimously approved a new financial aid plan intended to support college access for lower-income families and students. Under the policy, known as the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, undergraduates who are in their first four years of attendance at UC‚Äîor two for transfer students‚Äîwill receive enough scholarship and grant assistance to at least fully cover their systemwide UC fees if they have incomes below $80,000 and meet other basic eligibility requirements for need-based financial aid. = Project You Can = In October 2009, seeking to help keep the University of California accessible and affordable for California students, President Yudof announced an ambitious effort that aims to raise $1 billion for student support over the next four years. Through the fundraising effort, Project You Can, all 10 UC campuses have committed to raise $1 billion in the aggregate over the next four years‚Äîdoubling the amount of private support the system has raised for scholarships, fellowships and other gift aid in the previous five years.UC Newsroom announcement http://youcan.universityofcalifornia.edu/scholarships.html The UC Board of Regents endorsed the effort at its November 2009 meeting. Yudof made the Project You Can announcement at Sunnyside High School, which for 10 years has propelled promising students toward health careers through its Doctors Academy, a program sponsored by UCSF Fresno. Despite facing social and economic barriers ‚Äî 87 percent of Sunnyside's students are eligible for free or reduced lunch ‚Äî all Doctors Academy graduates have gone on to college, 43 percent of them at UC campuses.  Selected papers  Citing increasingly unreliable funding provided to universities by state government, President Yudof called for the federal government to bolster its financial commitments to the nation's universities and colleges in his paper titled Exploring a New Role for Federal Government in Higher Education. In announcing the proposal, Yudof remarked: UC Budget blog, http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/budget/?p=950 > We must find creative ways to expand the federal commitment to research and > access into a new  The nuts-and-bolts core funding that is vital to > a robust university, allowing it to hire quality professors, equip > laboratories and expand the physical plant.

The place is located on the bank of River Seetha. It is also called as 'temple town'. Barkur is located 16 km from Udupi, another ancient city, and 3 km from Brahmavara, a taluk of Udupi. The Seetha River flows through Barkur and joins the Arabian Sea. History Barkur was the ancient capital of the Alupa kingdom. It was known as Barakanyapura and later as Barakkanur. The rulers were known as Tuluva rulers. They spoke Tulu language. Many ancient inscriptions found in Barkur are in Tulu language. These are an essential part of history of Tulunadu . The Coastal Town of Barkur was also a flourishing port in the 15th and 16th centuries. At that time Barkur was referred as Capital of Tulunadu. Apart from the Alupa rulers, Alupa rulers made Barkur as their capital. Archaeological findings suggest that Barkur was a province under the Vijayanagar Empire in the 14th century A.D. Pandarideva was the Governor of this province under the regime of Harihara II. There are remains of two forts built by the Alupas and Vijayanagara governors. It was also a sub capital of the Hoysala kings for some period. The city had ten extensions called Keris - each being named after its professional residents. Each Keri had a tank and number of temples. Tradition says that, the King visited a temple every day, thus visiting all the temples of the city and on the last of the year, he visited the most important Panchalingeshwara Temple. That day was the day of car festival of this temple situated with the old Fort area called \\"Kotekeri\\". As per tradition, the city contained 365 temples, the remains of which can be seen to-day. A few of them are now in renovated condition. Besides, there are Bhutastanas (spirit worshipping centres). There are remains of palaces and other constructions in both the Fort areas. The port town was a busy commercial centre almost from the 2nd century B.C. Evidences of Megalithic and mesolithic ages have been discovered recently. The place abounds with history and has yielded a little over 100 stone and several copper plate inscriptions. They belong to the Alupa, the Hoysala, the Vijayanagara and the Keladi periods. The main language spoken in Barkur is Kundagannada dialect (‡≤ï‡≥Å‡≤Ç‡≤¶‡≤æ‡≤™‡≥ç‡≤∞ ‡≤ï‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®‡≤° ‡≤Ö‡≤•‡≤µ‡≤æ ‡≤ï‡≥Å‡≤Ç‡≤¶‡≤ó‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®‡≤°). Also Tulu, Konkani, Byari, other local languages widely spoken in Barkur. The place has several ancient temples with their typical sloping terracotta-tiled roofs. Many of these temples also contain inscriptions of historical value. Most of these temples are built between the 9th and 12th centuries. As you enter Barkur the first thing you see is the Kallu chappara (‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤ö‡≤™‡≥ç‡≤∞), which means roof of stone. A nandi is seated in this chappara. Sri Kalikamba Temple is also one of the famous temple which was built around the 14th century. Temple Architecture The temples at Barkur have a distinct architecture. The sloping terracotta-tiled roofs bear resemblance to the temples of Kerala, but they do not have gopurams, a common feature of the Dravidian style South Indian temples. ;Chowlikere Ganapathy Temple Chowlikere Ganapathy Temple was constructed 900 years back, during the Chola Period. The Bairagi Ganapathy Temple is entirely hewn out of stone with a slanted stone roof and etched stone pillars. The stone walls of this temple display beautiful sculptures and it is apparent that this mammoth structure has withstood the ravages of time. The Panchalingeshwara Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is Barkur's largest temple, and is one of the oldest in the town. Its double-storied gateway, with a pillared verandah on either sides, is most alluring. The rear side of the temple has an elephant-back-like curvilinear structure. The pillars that surround the circumambulatory path of the temple are decorated with carvings depicting mythological characters. ;Kathale Basadi Kattale basadi A 20-feet monolithic stone pillar is erected at the entrance. The temples were elegantly designed with carvings and embellishments, but are now in ruins. The twenty- four dents in the stone are the only evidence of the existence of idols of the twenty-four Jain thirthankaras. There are three main structures in a big courtyard with a victory pillar at the entrance. Archaeologists say that they were built between the 8th and 12th century A.D. Built by the Alupa rulers, the Jain Basadi, unlike most South Indian temples built in the Dravidian style, does not have a gopuram. The sanctum sanctorum is surrounded by stone walls otherwise known as Prangan, with sloping stone pillars over it. The original Mahavira idol was destroyed but has been replaced by stone tablets with animal figures that are a later addition. Katthale Basadi consists of Navranga with Nagkaali, Shiva, Vishnu and Jain deities with separate temples. It proves the existence of changing kingdoms with various rulers trying to control the city both politically and in terms of religion. Barkur Fort The Barkur fort was built by Harihara I, founder of the Vijayanagara Empire. The Barkur fort is spread across 20 acres of land. Inside the fort there are ruins of the kingdom. There are pillars used to tie horses and elephants which formed the part of the army. This fort was excavated several years ago by the archaeologists in a few acres of land, which is now an excursion site. Transportation Barkur Railway station There is a railway station in Barkur on Konkan railway Mumbai-Mangalore route. Barkur can be reached by bus from Udupi town. Public transportation within village is mostly by rickshaw.

Fields Bar, Magic Castle Whit \\"Pop\\" Haydn (born July 19, 1949 as Whitney Wesley Hadden in Clarksville, Tennessee) is an American magician, and the winner of seven performing awards (for performances in showrooms at the Magic Castle) from the Academy of Magical Arts. He has been nominated by his fellow members for \\"Magician of the Year\\" in Close-Up, Parlor and Stage, Bar and Lecturer more than thirty times. In February 2006, he also became Vice- President of that organization, and served for four years in that capacity. He has opened for Jerry Seinfeld, the Smothers Brothers, Loretta Lynn and others, and performed on cruise ships of many different lines, including Cunard Line's Queen Elizabeth 2, and the Diamond Princess. Haydn has worked hotels and casinos including Caesars Tahoe, and was one of the first acts chosen in 1996 to open Caesar's Magical Empire in Las Vegas. He was the chief magic consultant on Norman Jewison's Bogus starring Whoopi Goldberg, G√©rard Depardieu and Haley Joel Osment as well as a consultant on multiple television documentaries including the Discovery Channel's \\"Houdini, People Came to See Him Die\\" and David Copperfield's television special, \\"Orient Express.\\" He has recently designed magic for television episodes of \\"Bunheads\\" and \\"Franklin and Bash.\\" He appeared on \\"Haunted Collector\\" as a consultant on gambling history. In recent years, he has adopted the persona of an \\"expatriate con man and medicine show huckster from the early 20th century,\\" and he has headlined such venues as the World Steam Expo. In September 2012 he sat on a panel, at Stan Lee's Comikaze Expo on the subject of the steampunk subculture and its relation to other subcultures. Life Whit Haydn was born to minister (Disciples of Christ) William J. Hadden, Jr. and Margaret Shumate (daughter of Whitney Shumate and Jessamine Shumate), an elementary school librarian.Hadden, Margaret Shumate. My Memoirs. Sterling, Va. [sic]: E. Lunney, 2006. . At a summer camp at the age of 10, Haydn witnessed a magic show by a Methodist minister who was an amateur magician, and Haydn reportedly stayed up all night trying to figure out what he had seen. This became the beginning of a lifelong fascination. Three local North Carolina magicians‚ÄîDick Snavely of Raleigh, Bill Tadlock of Rocky Mount, and Wallace Lee of Durham‚Äîbecame mentors for the young magician. At fourteen, he borrowed money for a bus ticket to one of the major American magic conventions, Abbott's Get Together in Colon, Michigan, having convinced his parents to let him take the long bus ride alone. He graduated from Rose High School in Greenville, North Carolina, and attended college at East Carolina University in the 1960s, where he also became heavily involved in the civil rights and anti-war movements. He left college in 1969 to challenge the draft, and became one of Pitt County's first conscientious objectors. He did some alternative service at New York University Hospital, but after being released from C.O. status, and the job, when he flunked the physical (due to poor eyesight), he started doing street magic in the West Village. In 1970, he went back to school at Lynchburg College in Virginia, receiving a B. A. degree in philosophy and comparative religion in 1972, after which he attended Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia to become an Episcopalian priest, though he continued performing magic to help support himself at the school. Dr. Reginald H. Fuller, a well-known New Testament scholar, saw one of Haydn's performances at a student/faculty party, and suggested that Haydn's passion might lie not in the ministry, but in magic. A few weeks later, Haydn dropped out of the seminary and turned to magic full-time. Working as an actor/juggler/magician with a touring political theater under the direction of Bob Leonard, The Road Company, Haydn continued to develop his magic performances. In the mid-1970s he performed at the prestigious Magic Castle, where the Master of Ceremonies, Billy McComb, stumbled over the name \\"Hadden\\", so he, Dai Vernon, Kuda Bux and some other well-known magicians encouraged Hadden to change his name to something easier to pronounce. They settled on \\"Haydn\\"‚Äîpronounced as \\"HƒÅden.\\" McComb became a mentor and major influence on Haydn's career. 1979, \\"Stage Magician of the Year\\"Haydn is the co-founder (with Chef Anton) of the \\"School for Scoundrels\\". Since 1996, this program has held a four-week course once a year at the Magic Castle in Hollywood, to teach magicians, gambling experts and law enforcement officers the history, psychology and methods of street scams such as Three- Card Monte, Fast and Loose, and the Shell Game. Haydn currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Nancy Magill. They work together on Pop Haydn in the 21st Century ‚Äì a live theatrical variety show. In this steampunk-oriented reinvention of a 1910 medicine show, Pop sells his Amazing Miracle Oil, pitches Magnetized Water, demonstrates the ability of a Tesla Coil to bend the force of gravity with the help of Tesla Girl and reads people's past and future through the Sphere of Destiny. Whit is named for his grandfather, Whitney Shumate, and is the grandson of the noted artist, Jessamine Shumate. He has one grown daughter, Jessamine, and two grandchildren, Carmen and Jack.

Such a strategy is often sought because it avoids costly legal expenses and potential problems with eviction. This kind of activity is common in regions where rent control laws exist, but which do not allow the direct extension of rent-controlled prices from one tenancy to the subsequent tenancy, thus allowing landlords to set higher prices. Landlord harassment carries specific legal penalties in some jurisdictions, but enforcement can be very difficult or even impossible in many circumstances. However, when a crime is committed in the process and motives similar to those described above are subsequently proven in court, then those motives may be considered an aggravating factor in many jurisdictions, thus subjecting the offender(s) to a stiffer sentence. Types Various methods may be employed in cases of landlord harassment, such as, but not limited to the following: * Withholding maintenance on the property, such as garbage collection, landscaping, or repair of broken fixtures * Verbal and written complaints, imagined or exaggerated, of tenant's supposed improper conduct (see eviction) * Deliberate defacing of the rented facilities or the property of the tenant * Creating a nuisance for the tenant (for example, by generating loud noise) * Intimidation and threats of physical or financial injury directed at the tenant * Physical assault or other direct criminal activity directed against the tenant * Attempt to enter apartment or housing without cause, or without emergency need to check on premises or on tenant activity * Claiming emergency when no emergency exists to enter apartment, housing, dwelling etc., without proper notice. * Not letting tenant peace on property via repeated attempts to enter dwelling. * Harassment about rent not paid, or not paid in full. * Disconnecting water supply or electricity, without proper notice Protections At common law tenants were entitled to the \\"quiet enjoyment\\" of leased premises. American common law has also adopted the \\"warranty of habitability\\" which ensures that residential premises remain in repair. In the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, the Human Rights Act may provide a basis to establish what is fair and reasonable between tenant and landlord. The right to private and family life, and the right to enjoy one's possessions, are enshrined in this law. The right to an effective remedy and the right to express oneself freely should give the tenant the confidence to seek timely and reasonable resolution should they be suffering or under duress. Although human rights legislation is generally only enforceable against public bodies, it provides a framework of reasonability. Depending on the specific circumstances, United Kingdom legislation such as the Public Order Act 1986 and the Fraud Act 2006 may provide specific remedies. Both common law and public order legislation makes it an offence for persons to behave wrongfully in a dwelling e.g. breach of the peace. Fraud legislation makes it an offence for a person to make a wrongful or forced gain (monetary or other) personally or for the body they represent. Many local jurisdictions have very specific landlord-tenant legislation that sets out the duties of the landlord, a breach of which may be considered \\"harassment\\". For example, in California, Civil Code Section 1954, limits the landlord's right of entry, in New Mexico, there is an extensive \\"Owner-Resident Relations Act\\" and in New York City, a Certification Of No Harassment (COHN) is required to make any occupancy alterations.https://rew-online.com/2016/02/understanding- single-room-occupancy-laws/https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/certification- of-no-harassment.page Reasonable entry by the landlord The conduct of business inside or at a dwelling must depend upon the reasonableness and willingness of the parties. If a landlord desires to inspect the dwelling at reasonable intervals and at reasonable times, it is advisable to have this in a contract proper--- Regardless, the purpose of the inspection must be clear, and the conduct of the inspection must be properly regulated. The purpose of any inspection is surely to ensure the integrity and good maintenance of the property, and the adherence to the agreement that exists between landlord and tenant. Entry into a dwelling does not give the landlord the right to gather information on, or to investigate, or interfere with, the privacy of the tenant. If the tenant is not comfortable dealing with the landlord or agent, then the tenant may wish to appoint a representative or friend. In either case, a simple and sensible record should be made. Commercial landlords can not harass their tenant by interfering with the entry way of a commercial building in any manner including creating real or metaphorical barriers. An example of a real barrier would be boarding up the store while an example of a metaphorical barrier would be failing to remove snow from the sidewalks. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/commercial-tenant- harassm_b_12624936https://www.nycbar.org/get-legal-help/article/landlord- tenant/commercial-tenant-harassment-lawyer/ The time taken to carry out the task should be reasonable. The tenant may not wish to conduct business inside a dwelling, and can reasonably ask the landlord to meet or transact business at an alternate place or address. For example, the landlord (or agent) may attend at the premises to carry out an inspection which will normally take only a matter of minutes. The parties may then agree to exchange a simple written statement of facts, and then meet at a neutral place to discuss the matter or remedy. Frequency of landlord visits Unless carrying out repairs, replacements and other work, the landlord is to limit the frequency of entries to those actually necessary to accomplish the work, Not for personal reasons at any cost. For the sake of retention of one's tenants and the avoidance of strife during tenancy, the keys to exercise of the right to entry are as follows. 1. Enter as infrequently 2. Always give ample notice and, if possible, allow rescheduling of the entry at least once to accommodate the tenant. 3. Always enter with a clearly defined objective in mind, and notify the tenant of it unless there is a strong reason not to do so. Landlord entering the unit Legally, even a rented home is the tenant's castle, and the landlord does not have an unlimited right of access. Once an individual has rented an apartment, they have legal possession of it for the duration of their tenancy. The landlord must give the tenant reasonable notice, before he can enter the tenant's private home. Originally, in an agricultural society, the law expected the landlord to rent the property to a tenant and then leave the tenant alone. It gave the landlord no right of access, but also no responsibility for repairs. The modern urban tenancy, especially in a multi-unit building with many building-wide systems, has forced that law to change. The landlord now has an obligation to make repairs and gets a right of access for that purpose. But that does not supersede the tenant's rights to privacy and to \\"quiet enjoyment\\" of the premises. One of the most common landlord-tenant disputes involves access for making repairs. State Sanitary Codes require tenants to allow the landlord \\"reasonable access\\" at reasonable times to repair code violations. What is \\"reasonable\\", however, is the subject of frequent disputes. A tenant may insist on giving the landlord access only by appointment, but they must be reasonable about scheduling appointments. To give an extreme example, since the landlord usually must schedule tradespeople during the normal working day, it is not reasonable for the tenant to insist that the plumber can only come in on Sunday evening. Plumbers, carpenters, painters, and other tradesmen sometimes operate on unpredictable or busy schedules, so if they fail to keep appointments, tenants are encouraged to document the missed appointment in writing to the landlord, in a letter or e-mail, and keep a copy. Because some landlords may use lack of access as an excuse, tenants are also encouraged to keep scheduled appointments and maintain a good written record of their efforts to allow the landlord access to their property to make the desired repairs. In addition, because of documented cases of tradesmen stealing property, making long-distance phone calls, or committing other abuses while making repairs, tenants are also urged to make sure that the landlord or a representative be with repairmen at all times when they are in the tenant's property during the tenant's absence. Housing courts can often be helpful in mediating disputes over access. The tenant's credibility in court will be improved if he or she has consistently cooperated reasonably with the landlord's need for access, and has documented their cooperation with careful record-keeping. If necessary, with a particularly difficult landlord, the tenant may benefit from asking a witness to observe interactions, and later testify about the landlord's conduct. Many leases give the landlord certain entry rights. For example, under Massachusetts General Laws, ch.186, ¬ß15B, a rental agreement may only provide for the following rights to access: * to inspect the premises; * to make repairs; * to show the premises to a prospective tenant, purchaser, mortgagee, or its agent. The landlord may also enter the premises in accordance with a court order or if the tenant appears to have abandoned the premises. If a lease allows the landlord to enter for any other reason, that provision is illegal and void. In addition, the landlord's right to inspect the premises or to show them to a prospective purchaser does not mean that he or she can do it twice every day; the tenant can limit inspections to reasonable frequency. Unless the lease provides that the tenant must give the landlord a key to their property, the landlord has no right to one. The fact that a lease allows the landlord a right to enter for certain purposes also does not mean that the landlord may enter a private residence at any time without an appointment. The right of the landlord to enter if the tenant appears to have abandoned the premises sometimes causes a problem when tenants are moving out. The tenant may have moved out most of their furniture and intend to return to pick up the last few things and clean up the apartment before turning in the keys. If the landlord believes the tenant has vacated the premises, however, he or she may come in ahead of the tenant, remove the remaining property, and attempt to charge the tenant for the \\"mess\\" they left. To avoid this situation, tenants are encouraged to be clear with landlords about plans to vacate, and to do so in writing. In one documented case, a tenant came back from his vacation and found someone else living in his apartment, with his furniture stored in the cellar. He wasn't behind on his rent, but he had been away for a while, and the landlord concluded that he had abandoned the apartment. To preclude any perception of abandonment, a tenant who is going out of town may benefit from informing his or her landlord of the trip, preferably in writing. If the tenant is away for an extended time, does not pay the rent, and does not respond to inquiries from the landlord, a court may find the landlord justified in concluding that the tenant has abandoned the property. Retaliation A landlord cannot try to evict a tenant, raise the rent, or change the terms of tenancy because the tenant has complained in writing to the landlord, or to any government agency, regarding conditions. The landlord also cannot retaliate in this fashion because a tenant has organized or joined a tenant union, or engaged in certain other protected activities. Within six months after a tenant has engaged in any of these protected activities, any act by the landlord of raising the rent, attempting eviction (except for non-payment), or making any change in any of the terms of tenancy is presumed to be a retaliation. This means that in any court proceeding, the burden will be on the landlord to prove that he or she is not retaliating against the tenant. In order to defeat a retaliation claim, a landlord must convince the court that he or she took the action for reasons independent of the tenant's protected action, and that he or she would have done the same thing at the same time even if the tenant hadn't engaged in the protected activity. If the landlord waits until six months after protected actions, retaliation may still be found, but the burden of proof is on the tenant. If a landlord is found to be retaliating, he or she will not be able to evict the tenant, who may also be awarded damages from the landlord of one to three months' rent plus attorney's fees. The landlord also cannot willfully deprive the tenant of heat, hot water, gas, electricity, lights, water, or refrigeration service. Nor can the landlord lock out the tenant or remove him/her from their apartment without going through the proper court procedure. The tenant can ask the court to issue a restraining order, file a criminal complaint against the landlord, or sue him/her for money damages and attorney's fees. Because of these options for recourse, it may be to the tenant's advantage to complain about code violations in writing before the landlord issues a notice of an eviction or a rent increase. If a tenant attempts to claim retaliation, but did not complain about violations until after he or she received notice from the landlord, the tenant will be found to have no valid claim. The court will not find that the landlord was retaliating against the tenant for an action he or she had not yet taken. Consumer protection law Consumer protection laws also provide some protection against landlord harassment in some states. One such statute is Chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws, commonly called the \\"Consumer Protection Law\\". Like the Federal Trade Commission Act on which it is based, and similar \\"baby FTC\\" laws in other states, it prohibits the use of any unfair and deceptive acts and practices in the conduct of any trade or business. Housing rental is generally considered to be a trade or business, and the Massachusetts Attorney General has issued regulations which define unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the rental housing field. Practices defined as unfair include failure by the landlord to disclose, to a tenant or prospective tenant, any fact of the disclosure of which may have influenced the latter not to enter into the transaction. Also defined as an unfair practice is any violation of any law meant to protect consumers, and any act which is oppressive or otherwise unconscionable in any respect. While the Consumer Protection Law provides some protections for tenants. If a landlord is the owner-occupant of a two-family or three-family house and owns no other rental property, he or she is not considered to be engaged in a trade or business, and is not subject to this law. The 2016 New York commercial ordinance prevents a landlord from taking actions that will cause a commercial tenant to vacate their property or to surrender any rights.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/commercial-tenant- harassm_b_12624936 See also * Landlord‚Äìtenant law * Arizona Tenants Advocates ReferencesExternal links *Housing and Anti-Social Behaviour: The Way Ahead a summary of research initiatives and legal steps regarding housing problems (United Kingdom) *Are you being harassed by your landlord? at Salford City Council web-site (United Kingdom) *Landlord Harassment prevention laws in California and the San Francisco Bay Area (United States of America) Abuse Landlord‚Äìtenant law * Harassment ","title":"Landlord harassment"},{"id":"6376241","text":"Homoeosaurus is an extinct genus of sphenodont reptile.

It was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in February 1960. It was later printed bundled with \\"The Martian Shop\\" (1959) in The Edge of Tomorrow. A full version of the story was also included in The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus (1973) edited by Brian Aldiss. It is now freely available online. Plot introduction Fast's story is about how a group of scientists and educators, through a controlled environment, succeed in raising naturally gifted children into \\"man-plus\\"--people who possess comparatively super-human abilities. They possess unparalleled understanding of all technical subjects such as math, physics and unlock natural telepathy. They also excel at physical endeavors, such as sports and break numerous physical records. Their controlled environment, an isolated compound in California comprising , is a government sponsored facility granted for the raising of the children. The scientists were given fifteen years, later extended by three more years and a few weeks, to experimentally raise the children. By a very early age, the children surpass their teachers' knowledge. Plot summary The story begins as a series of communiqu√©s between a sister, Jean Arbalaid, and her brother, Harry Felton, recently retired from the military. Jean and her husband, Mark, are renowned and well-connected psychologists. Since he is unemployed, Jean sends Harry on a series of trips to investigate some extreme cases of feral children. His reports back to her confirm her hypothesis that children are a result of their environment. Jean and Mark convince the US government to sponsor an experimental program to raise 40 children in a controlled environment, tailored to allow them to reach their full potential. The children in question, all babies when arriving at the government-sponsored compound, are all to be naturally gifted. The compound the government grants them is a secluded compound in California. The researchers are given 15 years to raise the children. Next she sends Harry to find a Professor Hans Goldbaum who, before World War II, had written a paper about how he had discovered a set of characteristics in babies that would determine whether or not they would grow to be mentally gifted. Finding him, Goldbaum agrees to join their project and he and Harry set out to find a diverse set of gifted babies (orphans and those they could buy) for the compound. After delivering the children, Harry has no more involvement with the project. About eighteen years later, a White House operative, Eggerton, summons Harry and inquires him on his knowledge of the work in the compound. He truthfully tells them that he has no inside knowledge of the project, save what his sister told him in the project's beginnings, which he hadn't disclosed to anyone due to its secrecy. Harry is told that the compound was about to be visited for the first time since its beginning and, as they were about to enter, promptly vanished. It was replaced by a great, gray impenetrable barrier. In hearing this, Harry produces a letter he had received almost a year earlier from his sister. In it, they find an informal report on their progress in the experiment. Jean and Mark had recruited a group of educators, married couples only, to live and teach at the compound. All the educators, Jean and Mark included, acted as teacher/parents to all the children: no one child had one parent, no one teacher had one child. They then immersed the children in a knowledge-rich atmosphere. Since they were predetermined to be mentally gifted, they all progressed rapidly in knowledge and abilities. By the time they were five, the children were discovering their telepathic abilities. Jean relates that the children usually walk about nude, openly make love with one another, and possess unmatched knowledge in all academic and physical areas. They also share one mindset. With their advanced telepathic abilities, they constantly think as one, no verbal communication is necessary between them. When meeting with the researchers, who they love, but pity (due to their inferior intelligence and lack of telepathic abilities), only one child is necessary since all can hear and speak through the single representative's mind. Several children are born to the researchers while living at the facility. While these children are of normal intelligence, they flourish under the tutelage of the older children and become almost as gifted as them. Near the end of the fifteenth year, realizing that their experiment is about to be investigated, Jean worries what may happen to the children, now young adults, when the government discovers them. The experiment was a success--too much of a success. Not only have they raised mentally gifted people, they have given rise to a new race of super-intelligent demigods. Jean fears--correctly--that the government will react with fear and destroy the advanced super-race. The children, though incredibly advanced, are incapable of violence, even in self- defense. Jean is able to obtain a three-year extension, and then another of a few weeks when the three years expires. In that time, the children, now able to telepathically reach the entire Earth's population, build a defense mechanism which resulted in the gray barrier Eggerton described. Jean reveals that the barrier is based on time: the Earth outside the shield is a fraction of a millisecond in the future. They can pass outside without any difficulty. And though they can also get back in, Jean doesn't disclose how this is done. While cut off with the shield, the children are summoning other gifted children telepathically. Passing secretly outside the shield, they are to bring them into the compound to be raised like the others. Hopefully, given time, they would be able to construct more secret compounds to raise more super-intelligent humans. By doing this, perhaps they could turn the tide of humanity. This all depends, of course, on the security provided by their shield. At the conclusion of the letter, Eggerton says that now that they know the basis of the shield, the \\"eggheads\\" will find a way in. And when they do, they'll eradicate \\"the disease.\\" External links * The full text of \\"The First Men\\" Science fiction short stories 1960 short stories Works originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction ","title":"The First Men"},{"id":"6376495","text":"Louis Moore Bacon (born July 25, 1956) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and chief executive of Moore Capital Management. Forbes Magazine estimates his net worth to be US$1.81 billion, making him the 374th richest person on the Forbes 400 as of February 2017. Early life and education Bacon was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on July 25, 1956. His father, Zachary Bacon Jr., founded real estate company Bacon & Co. and later led Prudential Financial‚Äôs and Merrill Lynch‚Äôs real estate efforts in North Carolina. Louis Bacon: Macro maestro, Stephen Taub, July 1, 2011, Retrieved July 17, 2011. Bacon graduated from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he received his BA in American literature, graduating in 1979. Bacon met Walter Frank while he was working on a fishing boat on Long Island. He was given a job clerking at the specialist firm Walter N. Frank & Co during the summers of his college years. He subsequently received his MBA degree in finance at Columbia Business School in 1981. While at Columbia, Bacon traded commodities using a low interest loan he had received. During the first three semesters, he lost money and was forced to borrow money from his father to pay for necessities. He turned a profit during his fourth semester. Investment career After receiving his MBA, Bacon joined the sales and trading program at Bankers Trust. Later he left the firm and returned to Walter N. Frank & Co. where he traded currencies. Bacon then got a job on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange, working as a \\"runner\\". Bacon later worked as a broker and trader of financial futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers and eventually became the senior vice president for their futures trading division. In 1987 Bacon founded Remington Trading Partners and his market insights allowed him to profit during the market crash and subsequent rebound. In 1989, Bacon used his middle name in founding Moore Capital Management LLC and in 1990 created Moore Global Investments using the $25,000 he inherited from his family. In 2006, Forbes named Bacon as the 746th richest person in the world, and in 2011 he was listed as the 736th richest man. In 2010, the Denver Post reported that his $1.6 billion ranked him as the 238th richest American. In March 2010 Forbes Magazine estimated Bacon's net worth to be $1.5 billion and the 655th richest person in the world. In December 2013, he purchased Taos Ski Valley from the Blake family, who had owned it since 1954. Lawsuits= Feud with Peter Nygard  In early 2019, it was reported that Peter Nyg√•rd had filed a complaint with the U.S. Federal Court in Manhattan alleging that Bacon had violated sections of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Nyg√•rd and Bacon had been previously engaged in a protracted legal dispute over two adjacent properties they own in the Bahamas. Personal life In 1986 Bacon married Cynthia Pigott, a former Newsweek magazine staff member whom he later divorced in 2002. They had four children together. In 2007, he married Gabrielle Sacconaghi in Manhattan. In November 2007, Bacon purchased the Trinchera Ranch in Costilla County, Colorado from the Forbes family. The property sold for $175 million. In 2010, Bacon purchased the Orton Plantation in North Carolina which was built by his ancestor, Roger Moore, son of James Moore, in 1735. In 2002 Bacon obtained Austrian citizenship due to a special treatment for celebrities who have provided notable achievements for Austria. However this decision is being criticized by certain people because there is no particular achievement known. In May 2011, the High Court in London granted Bacon a court order to obtain information from the Wikimedia Foundation, The Denver Post, and WordPress as to the identities of internet users alleged to have defamed him. Legal experts suggested compliance with the orders was unlikely, given the US tradition of freedom of speech, and the fact that US courts typically required \\"actual evidence or sufficient allegations of libel\\" before granting similar orders. Political and economic views Bacon contributed ¬£500,000 to Britain's Conservative Party between 2010 and 2016. Bacon also served as a fundraiser for Mitt Romney. In 2015, Bacon donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush. Wealth In 1991, Bacon was 20th on the list of Financial World's Top 100 Wall Street Earners list. Philanthropy In 1992, Bacon created The Moore Charitable Foundation (MCF) to provide financial support to nonprofit organizations that work to preserve and protect wildlife habitat and improve water systems. Bacon has donated more than one million dollars to the environmental non-profit organization Riverkeeper. In June 2012, United States Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar and United States Fish and Wildlife Service Director Daniel M. Ashe announced Bacon intends to donate a conservation easement totaling approximately 90,000 acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains bordering the San Luis Valley in Colorado. This easement will provide the foundation for the proposed new Sangre de Cristo Conservation Area. Bacon owns the Trinchera Blanca Ranch located in the San Luis Valley. The Trinchera section of the ranch is currently protected by an easement administered by Colorado Open Lands. The new conservation easement Bacon intends to donate is to protect Blanca ‚Äì thus protecting all 172,000 acres of land. In addition to his work in Colorado, Bacon has helped preserve and protect environmentally sensitive land in New York, North Carolina, and the Bahamas. His key conservation projects include: * Robins Island, Long Island, New York: After purchasing the \\"Jewel of the Peconic\\" in 1993, Bacon secured the permanent protection of the land through a conservation easement and set about restoring a natural habitat that had been deteriorating for 300 years. * Cow Neck Farm, Long Island, New York: Bacon‚Äôs Cow Neck Preserve, LLC purchased the farm in 1998 and donated a 540-acre conservation easement to the Peconic Land Trust, thus preventing development and ensuring the protection of the area‚Äôs habitat. * Lyford Cay, Bahamas: Bacon is involved with the environmental restoration of Lyford Cay.  Legacy and awards  In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame. He is the 2013 recipient of the Audubon Medal, given in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of conservation and environmental protection. In 2016, Bacon received a Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership's Lifetime Conservation Achievement Award for authorizing conservation easements on more than 210,600 acres in the US.

Situated 18 km west of Trikala, right at the bottom of two mountains Itamos, and Koziakas, which mark the beginning of the Pindos mountainline, Pyli marks the entrance to a great gorge and the natural path that leads to the city of Arta. The river Portaikos, a tributary of the river Pineios, runs through this location. The municipality of Pyli contains 7 municipal units, but the town itself has a population of about 2,000. Most inhabitants are either self-employed in small business establishments or work in Trikala. Agriculture and animal herding as an occupation has been largely abandoned, though the surrounding area is ideal for both (mountainous and flat terrain). Pyli had always been the major trade center for the surrounding settlements. History The settlement of Pyli has been referenced since antiquity. It is first mentioned in the work of Pausanias, Description of Greece (Hellados Periegesis), a travel and cultural guide of ancient Greece, referenced as \\"Great Gates\\", because the location is a natural passage between Epirus and Thessaly. There also was a temple devoted to Aphaia Athena in the surrounding area, whose ruins can be still seen. It is also recorded that Alexander the Great passed through Epirus and came to Thessaly through Pyli, in order to ensure Thessaly's support in his plans (which was successful, the cavalry of Thessaly became notorious in Alexander's campaign). It was also later visited by King Philip V of Macedon. During Greco-Roman times, the location was found to be of strategic importance and the castle of Athinaion was used as an outpost, enabling monitoring of the plains in distances of up to 30 or 40 km (the famous Meteora are visible on a clear day from these outposts). In Byzantine times, after the first fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204 AD, various independent states emerged, among which the Despotate of Epirus and the principality of Thessaly. In 1283, the ruler of Thessaly, John I Doukas, founded the monastery of Porta Panagia in the area. Porta Panagia St Paraskevi Monastery Under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, the town prospered and while it had originally been situated in the north side of the river Portaikos, it is mentioned in the writings of Cosmas of Aetolia that he visited Pyli, and the residents gave no heed to his teachings. It is said that he cursed Pyli and its residents (then known as Porta), and they relocated to the south bank, where Pyli stands today. During the Ottoman era, Ali Pasha of Ioannina rebelled against the Ottoman Empire and tried to turn his domain into an independent state. During his campaign, his army camped briefly at Pyli, and lit a very large and venerable platanus, which was badly burnt, but survived due to its large and strong roots, and still survives to this day. During World War II, the area came under the authority of Italian occupation forces, and was the site of the Battle of Porta between the Greek partisans of ELAS and the Italians in June 1943. In 1943-1944 it was under German occupation. The Germans set fire to the monastery of the Dormition of Theotokos, believing that ELAS forces were in hiding there. In modern years, Pyli has been the local trading and education center for the surrounding villages and settlements, especially those situated in the mountainous area west of Pyli. Since Thessaly was merged into the Kingdom of Greece in 1888, Pyli was always intensely populated and bristling with activity, being characterized as a 'small town' and electing a mayor of its own. With the Kapodistrias plan in the late 1990s, Pyli officially became a municipality with 6 municipal prefectures under its jurisdiction, St. Vissarion, Ropoto, Palaiokarya, Petrohori, St. Prokopios and Kotroni. Municipality The municipality Pyli was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 7 former municipalities, that became municipal units:Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior * Aithikes * Gomfoi * Myrofyllo * Neraida * Pialeia * Pindos * Pyli The municipality has an area of 748.938 km2, the municipal unit 100.075 km2. After the 2014 elections, the new mayor is Kostas Maravas Monuments The stone arch Portaikos bridge, built in 1514. A place of great historic importance due mainly to its strategic location as well its unique landscape, Pyli boasts a large number of monuments, especially considering its size. * The basilica of Porta Panagia that dates back to 1264, on the north bank of the river Portaikos. The basilica of Porta Panagia was the katholikon of the monastery of the Irresistible Theotokos and is dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos. It was built in 1283 by the ruler of Thessaly, John I Doukas. The church is divided into two parts, the main church and the outer section. The main church is a three section cross roofed basilica, while the outer section is a cross shaped escribed dome. There are still pieces of marble decoration and structured that date back to the original ancient temple on top of which the church was built, but most were destroyed in a fire in 1855. The icons are also in need of restoration but they are still visible, though another fire in 1980 nearly destroyed them totally. * The monastery of St. Vissarion, where women are not allowed to enter and has a total of 365 cells for the monks, situated on Mount Koziakas. The monastery was re-established by St. Vissarion sometime between 1527 and 1535. The church that still stands today was built from scratch in 1557 by the archbishop of Larissa Neophytos II, and the bishops Joseph of Demetrias, Joseph, Luke of Litzas, and Martyrios of Fanari. The church of the monastery is situated at the location the church St. Vissarion built with the help of his brother, Ignatios. The iconography was completed in November 1557 by the painter George from Constantinople. The monastery was one of the richest and most active of the area. It has 366 cells, dining halls, land property in Romania, a rich library with important manuscripts (most of which currently reside in the National Library of Greece). In 1823 the monastery was looted by Suldje Kordja, and in 1943 it was bombed twice, by the Italians and the Germans. * The Monastery of the Theotokos, situated at Goura on Mount Itamos. Right on top of the town of Pyli at a height of 640m, it is a women's monastery dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos. The monastery was founded in 1743 with funds from the archon Dimakis, from the village Chaliki of the area of Aspropotamos. In 1770, during the Orlov Revolt, the monastery was looted by the Turks, in 1823 it was burnt by Suldje Kordja, and in 1854 it was destroyed again. In 1864 it was rebuilt only in order to be set ablaze again on May 11, 1878 by the Turks, because it was used as a rebel stronghold during the brief Greek rebellion in Thessaly that year. It was built anew in 1893 by the newly appointed chief of the monastery, Meletios Karanikas. In 1943 it was bombed and burnt by the Germans and in 1960 its church collapsed. In 1961 nuns were reinstalled in the monastery, and since then it has steadily bloomed. Today it is a small and picturesque monastery, especially when in celebration. * The ancient fortress of Athenaion is at an altitude of 1356m, near the monastery of the Theotokos at Goura. It was built somewhere between the 5th and 1st century B.C. It was taken over by King Philip V of Macedon, in 189 B.C., during his campaign against the Athamanians. It was destroyed in 46 B.C. by Julius Caesar. There is a mountain path to the castle. * The arched bridge at Pouri, which is considered to mark the end of the mountains and the beginning of the settlement, a classic example of stonemasonry of the era it was built (1514). This arched bridge was built in 1514 by St. Vissarion, and up to 1936 was the only link between the plains of Thessaly and the villages of Pindos. It is 67 m long, 2.05 m wide, 30.5 m high at the center and its parapet is 0.7 m high. According to the tradition, because St. Vissarion had no money with which to pay the craftsmen, they stopped work on the bridge. A bear then presented itself, which helped to carry the raw materials but also led the chief craftsman to move a large boulder and uncover a treasure. So the workers were paid and the bridge was completed. According to the same tradition, it was St. Vissarion who first crossed the bridge, and threw the chief craftsman's mallet a few kilometers away, and were the mallet was found, the monastery of St. Vissarion was built (in the north bank of the river, where presently the settlement of St. Vissarion or locally known as Dousiko (ŒîŒøœçœÉŒπŒ∫Œø) is situated). Climate View of Pertouli The climate in Pyli is worth mentioning since it has characteristics of both the plains and the mountainous regions of Thessaly. It is generally wet in the winter, with regular snowfalls each year averaging 30‚Äì40 cm of snow. There are also frequent rains, and low temperatures. In the summer it is arid and hot, though there are occasional buffs of cool breezes coming from the mountains. The surrounding forests and the river foliage of platanus trees provide small pockets of relief in the summer, so Pyli is a favorite stopover for many people from Trikala and the surrounding villages who are in search of some shade. Transportation There are regular buses almost every hour from and to Trikala, and tickets are available from and to Pyli directly from either Athens or Thessaloniki. Buses also provide access to the surrounding areas quite frequently (at least once a day), and there is a local cab service available. References * Nimas, Theodoros A.

Life Boliris was born in Cattaro (Kotor), in what was then called Albania Veneta (today Kotor, Montenegro). He studied in the University of Padua, where he studied law. In 1551 moved to live in the Kingdom of Naples, where he participated with Renaissance poets to create a volume - written in Italian - in honour of Giovanna d'Aragona, Dukess of Paliano. He died in Cattaro. In 1585, 13 years after his death, a poem of his in Latin in honour of Cattaro, which he had written while living in Tuscany, was published. Works He signed his Italian and Latin poems as Giovanni Bona, Johannes Bona and Ioannes Bonna. The most famous work of Giovanni Bona is \\"Descriptio sinus et urbis Ascriviensis (for D. Ioannem Bonam de Boliris, nobilem Catharensem)\\" (\\"Description of the Gulf and City of Cattaro\\" (by Mr. Giovanni Bona de Boliris, noble of Cattaro)) a poem of 331 Latin exameters with which he glorified the Bocche di Cattaro, Cattaro itself and the other localities of the fairy Gulf in the present-day Montenegro. The work was published in Lucca, in Tuscany, in 1585 by the Ragusan Dominican friar Serafino Razzi, in appendix to his \\"Storia di Raugia\\" (Ragusa) (\\"History of Raugia\\"). Bona de Boliris kept close relations with the literary circles in Italy, particularly with the poets gathered around the court of Naples. When Girolamo Ruscelli, in 1551, collected poetic texts for an anthology in honour of Giovanna d'Aragona, Dukess of Paliano, the beautiful Napolitan wife of Ascanio Colonna (member of the famous Colonna family), he invited to write also Bona de Boliris of Cattaro who, joining the initiative, was present in the volume published in Venice in 1554 with the title \\"Il tempio della divina signora donna Giovanna d'Aragona, fabbricato da tutti i pi√π gentili spiriti e in tutte le lingue principali del mondo\\" (\\"The Temple of the Divine Lady Mrs. Giovanna d'Aragona, Made by the Most Gentle Spirits and in All the Principal Languages of the World\\").  Dispute  There is a current dispute whether Giovanni Bona-Boliris belongs to the Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian or Italian literature. His works were written in Italian sonnet format and in Latin. Scotti's comments on the \\"Croatian latinists\\" (in Italian) Thus, with very few exceptions, the Serbian and Croatian historians insert this writer in their own national literatures changing his name respectively into \\"Ivan Bolica\\" and \\"Ivan Bunic\\". Bona was inserted (translated), at first in the anthologies of the \\"Croatian Latinists\\" of 1969 and then in the Montenegrin Anthology of 1979. Thus he had entered the first Italian anthology already in 1555, four centuries earlier. Bona entered the book about the Dukess of Paliano, not with poems in a Croatian language, but with an Italian sonnet and a Latin epigram, signing \\"Giovanni Bona da [from] Cattaro\\". Historical memories of Cattaro (in Italian) The famous Croatian essayist Slobodan Prosperov Novak, already president of the \\"Croatian Center of the Pen Club\\", has written recently in a book that ‚ÄúIvan Bolica remains eternally numbered in the Croatian literary history‚Äù.

The city of Dublin is named after a \\"black pool\\" (dubh linn, in Irish) that was once on its course. It rises in the Cookstown area, north of Tallaght, and flows into the River Liffey in the centre of Dublin. Course=Origins The Poddle begins as the Tymon River in the Cookstown area of Tallaght, northwest of Tallaght village, near the site of Fettercairn House, in what is now an area of light industrial development. It flows east, through Tymon North, and northeast, forming the northern border of Templeogue, towards Greenhills. Additional ponds were added to its course when Tymon Park was formed in the 1980s and 1990s.Lake on the Poddle in Tymon Park The river flows from Greenhills into Kimmage, where it used to receive an artificial stream from the direction of Templeogue. This, the City Watercourse, carried water from the River Dodder extracted at Balrothery Weir in Firhouse. The City Watercourse The Poddle's modest volume was boosted for over 700 years by the significant addition of water diverted from the River Dodder at the great weir at Balrothery in Firhouse, and carried by the three-kilometre first section of the City Watercourse. The ancient artificial watercourse was made not later than the 1240s, with the sanction of the English administration in Ireland. The watercourse takes an interesting bend after it crosses under Wellington Lane. This looks like the reuse of an existing ditch around an earlier ecclesiastical site. Often roads follow the boundaries of such sites. This would be a rare example of a watercourse doing so. Kimmage and The Tongue River Poddle upstream of Templeville Road, prior to flowing under itThe Poddle continues on through Kimmage and the edge of Crumlin, and is then split at \\"The Tongue\\" near what is now Mount Argus monastery in Harold's Cross. Here a wedge of stone, also known as the \\"Stone Boat\\", divides the flow, in a 2:1 proportion when a certain depth of flow is reached.right The lesser portion formed the second section of the man-made City Watercourse, heading for Crumlin Road and Dolphin's Barn, and on to the \\"City Basin\\" reservoir (est. 1720) in Basin Street. The City Basin was said to be one of the first urban water reservoirs in modern Europe, and the City Watercourse and Basin allowed many distilleries and breweries to be set up on the western edge of the city in the 1700s, including the St James‚Äôs Gate Brewery. It also became the original starting point of the Grand Canal, that was initially fed by the Poddle. River Poddle between the Russian Orthodox complex and Mount Jerome CemeteryThe greater flow continues along a form of the original river bed. In the 1990s, changes were made in the Kimmage and Harold's Cross areas, including the addition of a large fountain (as of 2019, not in operation for some years) to the river. The main course of the Poddle passes the Russian Orthodox Church complex and Mount Jerome Cemetery. Lower course The line of the two Poddle flows later recombine and pass under much of the south city centre in a culvert. The final stages of the river's flow are complex, with related waters separating and joining. Linked flows include the Tenter Water, and the river is joined by the Commons Water from the Coombe, and ultimately Crumlin. The present main course is itself a diversion, the Abbey Stream, of the original course, which ran further east. Nowadays, much of the lower course of the Poddle is in a large brick tunnel under the city streets and Dublin Castle, and while access is restricted, it is walkable. The confluence of the Poddle and the Liffey is visible at low tide at a grated opening in the Liffey walls at Wellington Quay.Confluence of the River Poddle and River Liffey at low tide at Wellington Quay, Dublin Dubh Linn and the origins of \\"Dublin\\" A large, dark pool once existed at the confluence of the Rivers Poddle and Liffey; this pool was described in Irish as dubh linn, which means dark pool or black pool. The city name, Dublin, is an anglicisation of this Irish phrase. This historic pool existed under the present site of the coach house and castle gardens of Dublin Castle. During the ninth century, Vikings established themselves as Kings of Dublin, and based their settlement around the confluence of the two rivers, upstream from the Stayne long-stone. History The Poddle was known colloquially as the river Salach, or \\"dirty river\\" in Irish. A variation of this name, \\"The River Saile\\", is used in the old children's song Weela Weela Walya, famously performed by The Dubliners. In 1592, Red Hugh O'Donnell and Art O'Neill escaped from Dublin Castle through a drain into the Poddle which runs under the castle from Ship Street gate to the Chapel Royal and the Undercroft. The Poddle was later used to provide a water defence for the south wall of the castle. For centuries the Poddle, progressively culverted, caused regular flooding and constant dampness in many buildings in the Blackpitts to St. Patrick's Street areas, including St. Patrick's Cathedral. For much of this time, a special public body, the Poddle Commission, operated, working to manage this, and with the power to raise a special tax to support its work. During a major reconstruction of the cathedral in the nineteenth century, the graves of Dean Jonathan Swift and Stella were moved to their present location, due to the problem of the Poddle. Water supply The river provided an early source of water for the city as the Liffey was tidal within the city area, and undrinkable, and the other major south-side water, the Camac, was too far from the main settlement (although there may have been a channel diverting some flow from it), while the Stayne River was too small. By the 13th century, the water supply was inadequate and a deal was made, in 1244/1245, with the Priory of St. Thomas to divert water from the Dodder at the weir at Balrothery near Firhouse to the Poddle, to provide the greater part of the water flow. As mentioned, this connection was allowed to dry out in the late 20th century, and only a tiny part still carries water, though ample evidence of the watercourse can be seen: the sluices and channel on the north side of the Firhouse weir still stand.

They differ from time machines in being a permanent or semi-permanent fixture linking specific points in time, and thus are an especially useful plot device when the plot involves characters moving many times back and forth. Appearance Time portals can be represented as vortices of energy, which allow matter to travel from one point in time to another by passing through the portal, or may appear as an ordinary doorway. In popular culture=Film In most films, time portals are used to take a group of people or a single person back in time. The most popular of all time travels would be traveling back to the time of the dinosaurs. In some films time portals can also be set as a hazard, for example, they can begin to go haywire which makes them accidentally transport something or someone from a different time to the present; again the most popular is a dinosaur being accidentally brought into the present world. Television The 1966-67 series The Time Tunnel. In the 1967 Star Trek episode \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\", a temporarily deranged Dr. Leonard McCoy runs into a time portal, an ancient sentient stone-like ring which calls itself the Guardian of Forever, and is transported back to 1930s Depression-era Earth and history is changed as shown when the Enterprise disappears from orbit. Captain James T. Kirk and Spock follow through the time portal to set things right. In the 1969 Star Trek episode \\"All Our Yesterdays\\", Captain James T. Kirk accidentally passes through a time portal. Spock and Leonard McCoy try to recover Kirk. All three are transported into the past of the planet Sarpeidon In the TV series Mirror, Mirror and its sequel Mirror, Mirror II, the story revolves around an old mirror. At the beginning of the story it is discovered that the mirror can be used to travel back into the past, 1919 and 1867 respectively. In the documentary Prehistoric Park in which Nigel Marven activates a time portal to travel to different geologic time periods to rescue rare prehistoric species. In the BBC television series; Goodnight Sweetheart, the main character; Gary Sparrow uses a time-portal to go back in time from the 1990s to World War II era Britain. In The Girl from Tomorrow Part II: Tomorrow's End, a time portal called The Time Gate is used by a terrorist from the year 2500 to take water from 1990 to his own time. The Science fiction series Torchwood centres most on the effects of a rift in both time and space, through which humans, aliens and devices emerge. In the science fiction series Primeval, a group of scientists investigate time anomalies, through which creatures travel. 11.22.63 features a school teacher being sent by a terminally-ill friend to go back to the 1960s (via a time portal in a diner closet) to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy, adapted from the novel by Stephen King. Computer games Time portals are a common element in computer games, most notably the Timesplitters series, which involves characters utilizing time portals to move through time and is intrinsic to the plotlines in the second and third installments of the series, where a character called Sergeant Cortez moves through time to complete his objective by using these portals. Time portals are also the original mode of time travel in the SNES game Chrono Trigger.

He pursued this, and clerked in a manufacturing business until age 28, when he and his brother Otto emigrated to the United States. He farmed for two years and established a grocery trade in Akron, Ohio in 1852. Remembering that back in Germany he used to grind oats and sell them as breakfast food. He decided to do the same in Akron, Ohio and in 1854, Ferdinand Schumacher started selling his oatmeal, and from there it branched out to the rest of the United States. In 1857, he rented water power on the Ohio Canal in northwest Akron to power a mill for production of oatmeal. In 1858 he added equipment for pearling barley. He continued adding to his plant, and introduced steam power in 1875. Ferdinand Schumacher married his cousin, Hermine Schumacher, in 1851, they had seven children, three of whom survived to adulthood. He was active in the temperance movement, and was strongly for prohibition. He supported the erection of many churches. Schumacher ran unsuccessfully for Ohio Secretary of State in 1872 and 1882, and Ohio Governor in 1883 as Progressive Party nominee.

The Birmingham Baths Committee was a Birmingham City Council-run organisation responsible for the provision and maintenance of public swimming and bathing facilities within the Birmingham boundaries in England. They constructed bathing facilities within Birmingham through funding by the council. In the planning procedures before the construction of a swimming bath, the department regularly partnered with the Free Libraries Committee to provide a new swimming bath alongside a new public library. Establishment=Private baths Birmingham had been provided with swimming baths for some time before the establishment of the Birmingham Baths Committee, which became possible through the introduction of an Act of Parliament. These baths were private and members were often only the wealthy who were able to pay for the service. The baths received water from natural resources, often springs, which were plentiful throughout the town. Digbeth was a significant site for spring water and had provided water for the area for drinking and washing purposes as well as contributing to the River Rea. However, Digbeth and Deritend became increasingly industrialised and the natural spring was built over as a result. In William West's \\"Topography of Warwickshire\\" (1830), there were around ten private baths. Whilst the dimensions of the baths were small, they provided a range of services and had different aims.Topography of Warwickshire, William West, 1830 A major proprietor of bath houses in Birmingham was a Mr. Monro who had had premises in Lady Well and Snow Hill.The Birmingham Journal: Private Bath Advertisements, 17 May 1851 The campaign for public baths Private baths were advertised as having healing qualities and being able to cure people of diabetes, gout and all skin diseases, amongst others. On 19 November 1844, it was decided that the working class members of society should have the opportunity to access baths, in an attempt to address the health problems of the public. On that day, a committee was formed and a fund was opened. Within a week, ¬£4,000 had been donated to the fund. On 22 April and 23 April 1845, two lectures were delivered in the town hall urging the provision of public baths in Birmingham and other towns and cities. It was recorded that the attendance of the lectures was low, however, those in attendance were 'highly respectable'. A second public meeting was held by the committee on 15 June 1845, where they proposed to purchase a plot of land at the corner of Kent Street and Gooch Street in Birmingham. On 24 June 1845, the committee purchased the land for ¬£6,102, which was taken from the funds they had accumulated. Official establishment of the committee Plaque on Harborne Baths, showing membership of the committee as at December 1923. After a period of campaigning by many committees, the Public Baths and Wash-houses Act received royal assent on 26 August 1846. The Act empowered local authorities to incur expenditure in constructing public swimming baths out of its own funds. Following the Act of Parliament, the town council called a meeting on 7 October 1846. It was at this meeting that they decided to adopt the act, and at a meeting of the Public Baths Association in November 1846, they decided to give the land purchased by the committee to the council. On 2 October 1848, the council gave their sanction for the construction of the first public baths and wash house on Kent Street site purchased by the Public Baths Association. Baths owned by the committee The committee constructed many public baths and never acquired private baths. Also, Birmingham was undergoing a period of change in that it absorbed many urban districts which were not within the boundaries before. As a result of this, the committee often gained the ownership of bathing facilities owned by the district councils before. Kent Street Baths Kent Street Baths, while an empty building under the name of Kent House. Kent Street Baths were the first baths opened by the committee. Construction began on 29 October 1849, with the laying of the first foundation stone. The baths were opened on 12 May 1851,Aris's Gazette: Birmingham Baths Committee Public Notice, 12 May 1851 however, the baths were not completed until 1852. The building was designed by D. R. Hill. The baths were close to the town centre and so received a good amount of water. However, this supply of water posed a problem to builders of the baths who found it difficult to prevent water from entering and flooding the construction site. The final cost of the baths was ¬£23,000. The building contained first and second-class swimming baths for men, first and second-class baths for women, Turkish baths and laundry facilities. On 30 March 1914, a women's swimming baths and baths for women were opened in an adjoining building to the main building on Gooch Street. In 1930, the main buildings, with the exception of the women's bath on Gooch Street, were demolished and new facilities were built in a more modern style. The building contained a gala swimming bath, private baths, Turkish and Russian baths, offices and a repair and maintenance depot. It was opened on 29 May 1933.Official opening after reconstruction of Kent Street baths, 29 May 1933, Birmingham, England, Baths Department, 1933 Designed by Hurley Robinson, it was of art deco architecture and remains today as Kent House. The bath suffered heavy damage during World War II with the loss of the gala bath to a heavy night raid on 3 December 1940. The surrounding buildings were also damaged from the blast. When the war finished, the committee repaired the baths. In September 2009, after lying empty for years, the baths were demolished by Benacre Property, the landowner, provoking a local outcry. Despite being Grade B locally listed, Birmingham City Council were unable to save the building and the site has now become a surface car park. Woodcock Street Baths At a meeting of the council on 28 September 1852, the committee were advised to look for another site for a second suite of baths. The area selected for the suite of baths was Duddeston. The sites were narrowed down to Woodcock Street and construction began on 25 July 1859. Construction was completed considerably quicker than that of the Kent Street Baths and the baths were opened on 27 August 1860. The buildings were of a Gothic style as opposed to the Baroque style of the original Kent Street Baths. Facilities provided included a large swimming pool, suites of private baths for men and woman, each with a small plunge pool. Additions were made which included a first class swimming pool, suites of first class private baths and a steam laundry to ease the demand at Kent Street. After World War I, it was decided that the baths should be reconstructed. The buildings, with the exception of the 1902 bath, were demolished and the new buildings were opened on 14 April 1926. A gala bath, suites of private baths for men and women, a new laundry and offices were constructed. The baths were improved again in 1948 with the installation of underwater lighting, improved lighting in the bath hall and the application of sprayed asbestos acoustic treatment to the bath hall ceiling. Northwood Street Baths In 1853, the inhabitants of the northern districts of Birmingham campaigned for the construction of a swimming bath in the area. A site between Northwood Street and Kenyon Street was chosen and construction began on 30 May 1861. On 5 March 1862, the baths had been completed and were opened to the public. The architecture was of red brick with a blue brick base. The fa√ßade was decorated in block stone dressings and stone string courses with moulded cornice and cappings. The baths closed in 1947 as a result of being destroyed beyond repair by air raids in World War II. The buildings were the oldest owned by the committee as the Kent Street and Woodcock Street baths had been reconstructed during their life times. The baths offered first and second class swimming baths as well as large private baths. The private baths were transformed into a First Aid post upon the outbreak of the Second World War. Monument Road Baths Providing baths for the northwest of the town had been an issue since 1867, however, action did not begin until 1877 when a site at Monument Road was acquired by the committee. Construction of the building commenced early in 1881 and the baths opened on 27 February 1883. The baths provided the area with first and second class baths, suites of first and second class men's and women's private baths, and Turkish baths. It fast became the second most popular bath owned by the committee, with attendances only being exceeded by the baths at Kent Street. Just before the outbreak of the Second World War, it was decided to demolish the buildings and to construct a modern facility. However, as a result of planning restrictions, the site was resized and made smaller allowing the construction of only one swimming bath and no Turkish baths. The baths were opened on 27 June 1940 during World War II. The baths were demolished at the end of the century. Green Lane Baths Green Lane Masjid (mosque), formerly Green Lane Public Library and Baths (Martin & Chamberlain 1893-1902 Talk of providing the areas of Bordesley and Deritend and the adjoining wards with baths had been around before that of the Monument Road Baths. The committee presented the council with a site they believed suitable for the construction of the baths, however, this was rejected on the grounds that a cheaper site be found. By the end of 1887, no alternative site had become available and the original proposals were renewed. There were slight amendments made to the proposals, but again the proposals were rejected. In 1890, the committee joined with the Free Libraries Committee who had also been looking for a site for a new library in Bordesley. A proposal was put forward by the two committees for the site at Green Lane, Small Heath for the erection of baths and a library. The council approved the proposal but financial problems meant that the baths did not open until 29 October 1902. The baths provided first and second class swimming baths and first and second private baths for men and women. The baths suffered severe damage during an air raid in the night of 18 October 1940. After the end of the war, the council granted permission for the reconstruction and reparations of the baths and work commenced in 1951. Moseley Road Baths The baths in Balsall Heath The approval for the construction of baths at Moseley Road came about through the discussions for the inclusion of Balsall Heath into Birmingham. The order for the inclusion of the area into Birmingham came into effect on 1 October 1891 and the committee were soon told to find a suitable location to construct baths. Once again, the Baths Committee joined with the Free Libraries Committee to find a site and they soon found a site on the Moseley Road. Following some construction problems, the baths were opened on 30 October 1907 and offered a first class swimming bath with a gallery for spectators, a second class bath, suites of first and second class private baths for men and women, a clubroom and a small room for laundry facilities. The building remains and is Grade II* Listed. It has undergone emergency repairs and a bid for Lottery Heritage Money is set to be submitted. Nechells Baths The grade II listed public baths on Nechells Park Road, Nechells. In 1900, pressure was put on the committee for the construction of baths in the Nechells area of the city. However, due to other activities in which the committee were participating in, the plan for Nechells did not begin until 1903 when a site at the corner of Nechells Park and Aston Church Road was purchased. In 1908, approval was obtained for the construction of the building by the architect Arthur Harrison, and it opened on 22 June 1910. It offered a large swimming bath with a gallery for spectators and suites of private baths for men and women. Following interest from Pete Waterman, whose interest in using the baths as a recording studio fell through, the Birmingham Community Foundation Charity acquired and fully refurbished the baths, with the work being completed in May 2007 by the contractor Welconstruct. It cost ¬£5.5 million, with funding from Advantage West Midlands, the Heritage Lottery Fund and ERDF.Makeover is complete for Nechells Baths, Birmingham Post, 10 May 2007 (Received 11 May 2007) Kings Heath Baths Following the Greater Birmingham Scheme, the committee decided to immediately enquire into constructing baths in the area of Kings Heath. In 1911, a plot of land at Institute Road was purchased. The First World War interrupted plans for the development and it wasn't until 15 August 1923 that baths opened. They were constructed as part of the Unemployed Relief Words with facilities provided including a swimming bath with suites of washing baths for men and women. It also had the ability of being floored over in the winter months for social purposes. Harborne Baths Harborne Baths. Harborne acted after hearing about the residents of Kings Heath and in 1911, the committee also bought a plot of land in Lordswood Road. The baths were almost identical to that of the Kings Heath baths and offered exactly the same usages. Designed by architects Crouch, Butler and Savage,Plaque on Harborne Baths building. it opened on 13 December 1923. The building now carries a blue plaque, noting that the poet W. H. Auden lived in an adjacent house from 1919‚Äì39. The old building was demolished in 2010, with a modern replacement pool and leisure centre being built on the site. Saltley Baths The committee placed extra emphasis on the area of Saltley as it was densely populated. They purchased land in the area and the baths opened 30 July 1924. It was the first of the baths constructed by the committee to contain a pool. This allowed it to become a venue for competitive swimming. It also had the ability to be floored over in the winter months and be used as a hall. During World War II, it became popular as a public dancing venue. Erdington Baths Mason Road in Erdington was the next site chosen for the erection of baths by the committee. On the site, an establishment offering a swimming bath, suites of washing baths for men and women and Turkish baths was constructed and opened on 6 May 1925. The pool had the ability to be floored over in the winter months, however, winter swimming was popular at the facility and the floor was not added. Sparkhill Baths Sparkhill baths In 1923, a scheme to construct an Unemployed Relief Works containing baths in the area of Sparkhill was approved by the council, however, there was a lack of skilled labour due to the demand in house construction. The district pressed for a reconsideration in February 1927 and the committee decided to place focus upon the baths that were to be built on the site. They purchased land on the busy Stratford Road with the intention of building the most modern set of baths possible. Members of the committee were sent to towns to observe the latest types of baths built and were also sent to Germany to obtain information. The baths, designed by architect Hurley Robinson,Plaque on Sparkhill Baths building. opened on 29 July 1931. The main swimming pool was by with a depth of . The baths also featured a learner's pool specially suited for children near the entrance hall. There were 160 dressing boxes, which were not fronting onto the pool but in corridors. As well as the swimming facilities, there is a cafe. Soon after World War II, the pool was modernised with new lighting and acoustic treatment. As of September 2009, the baths are closed, with a decision to be made as to their future. Northfield Baths Northfield baths Northfield was a quickly developing area and the committee focussed on providing baths for it. It was decided to build the baths at Bristol Road South. As the area was predominantly new build, most houses contained their own washing facilities, thus removing the necessity for washing facilities at the baths. The Northfield Baths was designed by the architect Henry Walter SimisterThe Buildings of England. Warwickshire. Nikolaus Pevsner opened 8 May 1937 and consisted of a swimming pool and a learners' pool. It was a large site providing a lot of space for car parking. There was also a large cafe overlooking the main pool. In the early 1980s the large former gents changing rooms was converted to separate gents and ladies changing areas, with the former ladies changing area becoming an additional fitness suite. The changing facilities were again remodelled in 2003, along with the reception area, while the pool was closed to have a large refurbishment. The baths were closed in 2016 and the handsome Art Deco building demolished in 2017 and replaced by a new swimming and gym facility which opened in 2018. Kingstanding Baths Kingstanding was another newly developing area and the same approach was given like the Northfield Baths. Located on Warren Farm Road, the baths opened on 31 March 1938 and were the last to be constructed before the outbreak of World War II. The baths again offered a pool and a learners' pool. Baths acquired by the committee The Greater Birmingham Scheme received royal assent on 3 June 1911 and this resulted in the areas of Handsworth, Aston, Erdington, Yardley, Moseley, Kings Heath and Northfield being included in the Birmingham boundaries, thus expanding the city. Due to the acquisition of the areas, the baths committee also acquired four new baths; *Victoria Road Baths, Aston *Tiverton Road Baths, Bournbrook *Grove Lane Baths, Handsworth *Bournville Lane Baths, Stirchley. The Grove Lane facility was unusual in that it had two swimming baths, which was large for those days. It also allowed the swimming pool to have a floor fitted over it in the winter months for social purposes, such as dancing. In the late 20th century, after standing derelict for many years. these baths were converted into a number of residential apartments. A new leisure centre, with swimming pool, had meanwhile opened in the adjacent Handsworth Park. Bournville Lane baths, Stirchley Bournville Lane Baths were unusual in that they featured an aeration and filtration system for the water which was extracted from a mains supply. This meant that the baths did not need to be emptied and refilled. This system was modern and the system was later installed in all swimming baths controlled by local authorities meaning that King's Norton and Northfield District Council were the first local authority in the country to use such a system. The Baths were built in 1910 to a design by John P. Osborne. The building is Grade II listed. Post war committee After World War II, the committee were faced with the task of modernising and reconstructing many of the baths. Kent Street Baths, which had been the most popular bathing facility in the city, had been seriously damaged by a night raid and action by the committee was immediately taken to repair it. Several other baths had suffer light damage from bombing raids and needed repair work. Numerous baths were modernised with the installation of new lighting which was added to the roof and inside the pool itself. Acoustic treatment was added and in some cases, asbestos was sprayed in the buildings. The department continued to open baths including Stechford baths on 20 June 1962 by Councillor H. Bentley.Official opening of the Stechford Baths, Station Road, Stechford by Councillor H. Bentley, Wednesday, 20 June 1962, Birmingham Baths Department, 1962 In 1974, the baths committee merged with other departments in the council to form the Leisure Department. From 5 April 2004, management of leisure facilities was devolved to individual constituencies (originally 11, now 10). Cottage baths Cottage baths were small baths off streets which were sometimes built in converted buildings. Experiments of this in Manchester, Liverpool and Bradford were unsuccessful, and results from the experiment in Brighton were varied. In 1905, a member of the Health Committee published a report which strongly recommended the construction of cottage baths. This prompted the council to look into providing cottage baths. The first attempt by the committee was made in 1902 with the proposed conversion of the George Arthur Road police station into cottage baths. This was rejected and it was decided to build an entirely new building on Adderley Road. These proposals were unanimously approved. More baths were then constructed on Coventry Street in Digbeth, Brearley Street in Summer Lane, Bacchus Road in Winson Green, Lower Dartmouth Street, Grosvenor Road in Aston, Willis Street in Ashted and St Georges Street in Hockley. By 1950, however, only three baths remained in use due to decreasing attendances. All cottage baths were closed by 1960. Open air pools Open air pools were popular amongst the residents of Birmingham during the summer months as a place to cool down in the warm weather. The first municipal open air pool was opened in Cannon Hill Park, and they opened on 1 September 1873 on the same day the park opened. However, the pool was used by the boating club. The lease was not renewed in 1899 and it was decided that the committee should take control of the pool. The second pool was opened on 9 July 1883 in Victoria Park in Small Heath. It was larger than the Cannon Hill Park pool and consisted of a very similar shape. Brookvale Park Lake in Erdington became the third location for a pool. It was opened in a disused drinking-water reservoir and was opened on 7 October 1909. It was open until 1926. Open air pools were both a commercial problem as they only received money in warm weather, and they were also a risk to the health of the users. A report published by the Ministry of Health advised against the use of open air pools unless they were chlorinated and filtrated. The committee felt that cost of adding such systems to the pools in Victoria Park and Cannon Hill Park was too expensive and both pools were closed in early 1939.

It is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for Web cache validation, which allows a client to make conditional requests. This allows caches to be more efficient and saves bandwidth, as a Web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed. ETags can also be used for optimistic concurrency control, as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other. An ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a Web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource representation at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner, ETags are similar to fingerprints and can quickly be compared to determine whether two representations of a resource are the same.  ETag generation  The use of ETags in the HTTP header is optional (not mandatory as with some other fields of the HTTP 1.1 header). The method by which ETags are generated has never been specified in the HTTP specification. Common methods of ETag generation include using a collision- resistant hash function of the resource's content, a hash of the last modification timestamp, or even just a revision number. In order to avoid the use of stale cache data, methods used to generate ETags should guarantee (as much as is practical) that each ETag is unique. However, an ETag-generation function could be judged to be \\"usable\\", if it can be proven (mathematically) that duplication of ETags would be \\"acceptably rare\\", even if it could or would occur. RFC-7232 explicitly states that ETags should be content-coding aware, e.g. ETag: \\"123-a\\" ‚Äì for no Content-Encoding ETag: \\"123-b\\" ‚Äì for Content-Encoding: gzip Some earlier checksum functions that were weaker than CRC32 or CRC64 are known to suffer from hash collision problems. Thus they were not good candidates for use in ETag generation.  Strong and weak validation  The ETag mechanism supports both strong validation and weak validation. They are distinguished by the presence of an initial \\"W/\\" in the ETag identifier, as: \\"123456789\\" ‚Äì A strong ETag validator W/\\"123456789\\" ‚Äì A weak ETag validator A strongly validating ETag match indicates that the content of the two resource representations is byte-for-byte identical and that all other entity fields (such as Content-Language) are also unchanged. Strong ETags permit the caching and reassembly of partial responses, as with byte-range requests. A weakly validating ETag match only indicates that the two representations are semantically equivalent, meaning that for practical purposes they are interchangeable and that cached copies can be used. However, the resource representations are not necessarily byte-for-byte identical, and thus weak ETags are not suitable for byte-range requests. Weak ETags may be useful for cases in which strong ETags are impractical for a Web server to generate, such as with dynamically-generated content.  Typical usage  In typical usage, when a URL is retrieved, the Web server will return the resource's current representation along with its corresponding ETag value, which is placed in an HTTP response header \\"ETag\\" field: ETag: \\"686897696a7c876b7e\\" The client may then decide to cache the representation, along with its ETag. Later, if the client wants to retrieve the same URL resource again, it will first determine whether the locally cached version of the URL has expired (through the Cache-Control and the Expire headers). If the URL has not expired, it will retrieve the locally cached resource. If it is determined that the URL has expired (is stale), the client will send a request to the server that includes its previously-saved copy of the ETag in the \\"If- None-Match\\" field. If-None-Match: \\"686897696a7c876b7e\\" On this subsequent request, the server may now compare the client's ETag with the ETag for the current version of the resource. If the ETag values match, meaning that the resource has not changed, the server may send back a very short response with a HTTP 304 Not Modified status. The 304 status tells the client that its cached version is still good and that it should use that. However, if the ETag values do not match, meaning the resource has likely changed, a full response including the resource's content is returned, just as if ETags were not being used. In this case, the client may decide to replace its previously cached version with the newly returned representation of the resource and the new ETag. ETag values can be used in Web page monitoring systems. Efficient Web page monitoring is hindered by the fact that most websites do not set the ETag headers for Web pages. When a Web monitor has no hints whether Web content has been changed, all content has to be retrieved and analyzed using computing resources for both the publisher and subscriber.  Mismatched ETag detection  A buggy website can at times fail to update the ETag after its semantic resource has been updated. , an example of a prominent such site is \`export.arxiv.org\`. As a result, the incorrectly returned response is status 304, and the client fails to retrieve the updated resource. To detect such a buggy website: * Cache the response and ETag, assuming there is an ETag and that the response was not aborted. * For a subsequent request that would've included the If-None-Match header, do not send this header with perhaps a random 20% probability. With this probability, if the response returns an altered content but the same ETag as what was previously cached, mark the website as buggy and disable ETag caching for it. As a reminder, for a strong ETag, the content comparison can be byte-for-byte, whereas, for a weak ETag, it would check semantic equivalence only.  Tracking using ETags  ETags can be used to track unique users, as HTTP cookies are increasingly being deleted by privacy-aware users.

As a sighted guide, McLean returned to the sport in its Paralympic form, piloting Neil Fachie to two gold medals in the 2011 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships, and Anthony Kappes to a gold medal in the 2012 Paralympic Games. MacLean is only the second athlete, after Hungarian fencer P√°l Szekeres, ever to win medals at both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. MacLean has also won medals in five UCI Track World Championships in the team Sprint, Silver in 1999, Silver in 2000, Bronze in 2001, Gold in 2002, Bronze in 2003 and Bronze in 2004. MacLean also won a bronze medal for Scotland in the Team sprint at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, followed by a gold medal in the event at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Australia. Having returned to the Paralympic form of the sport as a guide to Neil Fachie, he won a further two golds at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in, and for, his native Scotland; in the Commonwealth Games, certain para-cycling events are integrated as full medal events into the programme. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to cycling. Career Born in Grantown-on-Spey, MacLean kicked off his cycling career as second man in the Great Britain Team Sprint until switching to lead man in 2002. He broke the GB kilometre record at the Olympic Trials in 2004. MacLean's career as a member of the British elite team came to a close in 2008. He suffered from a mystery illness ( later diagnosed as Coeliac disease) for the majority of his career so could no longer perform at the level required. This, coupled with the form of rising stars like Jason Kenny and resurgence of fellow veteran Jamie Staff, meant that he narrowly missed out on the squad for the World Championships and Olympic games. MacLean declared that the Manchester round of the World Cup Classics in November 2008 was his last ride as a UCI accredited rider. In the World Cup round he competed in the Keirin and Sprint for the Plowman Craven Trade team. He won his Keirin heat but was relegated by the officials. In the sprint he qualified in the top 5 but lost in the first round after a controversial move by his German opponent. He sat out international competition for two years from 2008 to 2010, the mandatory requirement to become a pilot for para-cycling tandem racing.MacLEAN RULES OUT OLYMPIC BID  Sporting Life At the 2011 UCI Para- cycling Track World Championships, MacLean piloted Neil Fachie to golds in the Tandem B Sprint and Tandem B 1000m Time Trial. In 2012, he switched to piloting Anthony Kappes, with Barney Storey piloting Fachie; the move was a success for both tandems, as each tandem team won a gold medal at the 2012 Paralympic Games. In doing so, MacLean became only the second athlete to win medals at both Olympic and Paralympic Games. While sitting out international competition, he continued to make some racing appearances at the Revolution events in Manchester. He appeared at Revolution 22 in December 2008, competing in the Sprint and Keirin events. MacLean reunited with Neil Fachie for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, where the pairing won gold in the kilo time trial. They followed this up with another gold in the sprint where they came back from losing their first ride in the final to beat the Australian duo of Kieran Modra and Jason Niblett 2‚Äì1. Television and Media In 2007 MacLean had an experimental documentary made about him called Standing Start made by BAFTA winner Adrian McDowall and Finlay Pretsell. The film documents MacLean in his build up to the World Cup team sprint win in 2007. The film has screened worldwide and premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. In November 2008 Craig took up the challenge of becoming a Bobsleigh competitor for the BBC programme 'Bobsleigh Challenge', which was broadcast in February 2009. This programme challenged Craig and fellow British sportsmen Jason Gardener, Dean Macey and Dan Luger to qualify for the British Championships in Italy, with only 10 days training. Craig teamed up with Luger as one team, while Macey and Gardener made up the other team. After training the teams had to complete two runs down the course without crashing to qualify. After a number of crashes, when both Craig and Dan were driving, both did qualify. However a number further crashes and injuries sustained by Craig meant that they did not complete two runs in the actual competition and were not classified. Just qualifying for the event with only 10 days training was still a remarkable achievement. The other team of Macey and Gardener went one better and finished 6th overall in the competition, ahead of one of the Great Britain Olympic Development teams. Craig is featured alongside Chris Hoy in a book by Richard Moore, Heroes, Villains and Velodromes: Chris Hoy and Britain's Track Cycling Revolution. This describes how Maclean and Hoy were key figures in the rise of British Track Cycling. The book was published in June 2008 by Harper Collins. () In 2009, he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame.

It was released for the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2006 at Xbox Live Arcade.  Gameplay  Small Arms is a hybrid platform, fighting and shoot 'em up video game, featuring anthropomorphic animals and super-deformed people, with ranged weapons. The gameplay can be compared to Super Smash Bros., Power Stone, Contra and Metal Slug. Similar to Geometry Wars, the player controls characters' movement with the left analog stick, and aims weapons with the right analog stick, which allows 360-degree aiming. Each weapon has primary and secondary modes, which the player can use with the right and left triggers, respectively. The player can also make characters jump or dash with the face buttons. Small Arms features four different single-player modes: Mission Mode, which pits the player against computer-controlled players in sequence; Training Mode, which teaches the player how to play the game; Challenge Mode, where the player faces an endless stream of opponents; and Shooting Range, where the player must shoot moving targets to score points. Small Arms also features competitive multiplayer for up to four players or bots, either offline or online via Xbox Live. Levels are visualised in full 3D although the players can only move in one two- dimensional plane. Several levels have special quirks to them: the \\"Bullet Train\\" level slowly forces the players to move across the length of the train; and the \\"Sewer\\" level has a pit in the middle of the map, which closes shut and fills with poisonous gas. Small Arms launched with eight maps, and two more maps were available as downloadable content bundled with the Ivar and Gullarp character download. The two maps that are included with the downloadable content are \\"Iceberg\\" and \\"Village\\".  Characters and weapons  Small Arms has 12 default characters, eight of which are initially available: Default characters: *Fox Claw: a runaway mutant who used to be her clan's deadliest female ninja, armed with a katanaLord Peet: a chivalry fanatic, armed with a crossbowMarky Kat: a former mercenary and now illegal arms trader and 3rd richest mutant cyborg, armed with a chaingunPector El Pollo: a former Mexican mutant wrestler, armed with a flamethrower and molotov cocktails *Mr. Truffles: a famous mutant assassin, armed with a sniper rifle and land mines *Tyrone: a dinosaur who was raised in a research facility in the Antarctic Circle, armed with an ice weaponUnit 51: an elite soldier of the Space Marines, armed with a lightning weapon *Z√∂e: a 22nd-century intergalactic female pop-star, armed with a plasma weapon Unlockable characters: *Billy Ray Logg: a mutant tree, armed with a buzzsaw weapon *ISO-7982: a mad killer robot, armed with an oversized pistol doubling as a missile launcher *Mousey McNuts: a 19th-century street urchin, armed with akimbo submachine guns *Professor Von Brown: a doctor of transcendental psychology, armed with psionic powers *available in trial version Two new characters were made available as downloadable content from the Xbox Live Marketplace on June 6, 2007: Ivar, and Gullarp. Each character has four different costume colours and a unique weapon (except downloadable ones). However, these weapons can be exchanged for other characters' weapons during gameplay.

Biography  Tierney was born in 1894 in the townland of Esker, near Castleblakeney, County Galway, the son of Michael Tierney, a farmer, and Bridget Finn. He attended St Joseph's College, Ballinasloe, and entered UCD in October 1911. He graduated in 1914 with a first-class honours degree in Ancient Classics. Two years later he was awarded his MA degree, and he worked as an assistant lecturer in Greek from 1918 to 1919 and 1920 to 1922. In 1917 he won a National University of Ireland (NUI) travelling studentship in Classics and used it to study in the Sorbonne, British School at Athens and Berlin from 1919 to 1921. He was appointed to the Chair of Greek in 1922. Tierney was elected a Cumann na nGaedheal Teachta D√°la (TD) for Mayo North in a by-election in 1925 and for the NUI constituency in 1927, a seat he held until 1932. Tierney came to corporatism through a study of Catholic social thought, and through an analysis of continental systems of corporatism, particularly those of Portugal and Austria. He was an early member of the Army Comrades Association (later known as the Blueshirts) and, along with Ernest Blythe, encouraged Eoin O'Duffy to become the leader. Tierney suggested the name \\"Fine Gael\\" for the new coalition between his party, the Centre Party and the Blueshirts.Maurice Manning, The Blueshirts, Dublin, 1970. p. 93 He was a member of Seanad √âireann from 1938 to 1944. He was the prime mover behind the transfer of UCD to its present site at Belfield. On 28 June 1923, he married Eibhl√≠n MacNeill, daughter of Eoin MacNeill. He wrote a biography of his father-in-law, Eoin MacNeill: scholar and man of action (1980).

He was executed at Tyburn, and is a Catholic martyr. Early life and conversion Scott was born in Chigwell, Essex around 1579, and was baptised into the Church of England. He was sent to school in London, and entered the University of Cambridge during Lent term 1593-94. At first he joined Trinity College, however, after a year he decided to migrate to Trinity Hall, which at the time was particularly noted for its excellence in the field of civil law, which Scott described as \\"a branch of study which was more comformable with my disposition and interested me more\\". He received the degree of LL.B. in 1600, and proceeded to London and the Inner Temple to train as a barrister. It was at this time that he began to seriously consider his religious faith. He had been firmly of the position that Catholicism and its claims were both false and treasonable, however, while visiting a Catholic friend, he began casually flicking through a book of theology and was struck by the force of an argument he read there. This caused him to enter into a period of intensive study and prayer, and it was only after two years of intellectual and spiritual struggle that he finally decided to be received into the Catholic Church. Entry into Benedictine life A notable catalyst in the process of Scott's conversion was the Benedictine prior John Roberts (now a Saint of the Catholic Church), who had come to London as a missionary. It was Roberts who received Scott into the Catholic Church, and also Roberts who accepted him as a Benedictine postulant. Scott was to be taken to Valladolid, Spain for his monastic formation in the Lent of 1604, but on attempting to leave England, he was arrested along with Roberts and a group of other postulants on suspicion of being Catholic. However, this arrest proved only a temporary delay, as immediately after his release he was taken to Valladolid by Augustine Bradshaw, where it was agreed that he should serve his novitiate at the Abbey of San Facundo, Sahag√∫n. As a Benedictine monk he took the name Maurus, and in 1610, he was ordained priest. He begged to be sent on the mission to England, and his request was granted. He was sent to St. Gregory's monastery, Douai (which still survives as Downside Abbey, having moved to England in the 19th century), where he was to make his preparations, and arrived in England in December 1610. Witness to the martyrdom of John Roberts Immediately after arriving in England, he was to discover that John Roberts, who had had such a profound influence upon him, had been arrested for serving as a priest. He was able to join Roberts for his last supper the night before he was put to death. The next day Scott watched as John Roberts was hanged, drawn, and quartered. After the execution, wishing to preserve Roberts' body as a relic, Scott watched to see where it was thrown. The limbs had been thrown into a large trench, and upon them were heaped the bodies of 16 criminals executed at the same time. Nonetheless, two days later Scott was part of a group which successfully recovered the body parts from the trench, although one quarter was lost when the party was disturbed by watchmen, and Scott was subsequently arrested. Following this, he was imprisoned for a year, until in December 1611 the ambassador for Savoy negotiated the release of imprisoned Catholic priests. Scott was banished from the country and went back to Douai. Nonetheless, he was extremely keen to return to England. Around the Easter week of 1612 he was arrested on a boat on the River Thames before he was even able to set foot in London. Arrest, trial and martyrdom After his arrest, he was examined by George Abbot, who had been Bishop of London at the time of the execution of John Roberts and Scott's arrest in 1610, and was now Archbishop of Canterbury. Abbot offered Scott an oath of loyalty to King James I. However, seeing that the oath was constructed in such a way that it implied disloyalty to the Pope and the Catholic Church, Scott instead suggested his own formula, declaring \\"that I am a loyal servant to His Majesty... also for the past and for the future, that I have been and to the last moment of my life will ever be loyal to my King; which is more than you exact by your statute\\". However, this was not accepted and Scott was placed in close confinement (although not before drawing on his legal expertise to insist that Abbot did not have jurisdiction to hand down such a punishment). Scott was tried on the 28 May 1612 at the Old Bailey. Again, his legal training was in evidence, as he skillfully avoided the questioning of those accusing him of being a priest, and insisted that it was the business of the prosecutor to bring evidence against him, not for him to convict himself. He entered a plea of not guilty. Only after the jury had found him guilty did he fall to his knees, crying out Deo Gratias, and admitted to his being a priest. He then addressed the people in the court, explaining that the only reason that he had not yet confessed himself as a priest was to see if the law would take its course, or whether he would be condemned on presumption of guilt without any proof. On the morning of May 30 he was to be executed with Richard Newport, another Catholic priest. He appeared wearing his Benedictine habit and declared himself once again a loyal subject of the King, before being tied to a horse and dragged through the streets to the gallows at Tyburn. Before being executed, he made a declaration of his life, his faith and his conversion to the Catholic Church, and gave the small number of gold coins he had in his purse to the executioner, saying, \\"Take these, friend, for love of me. I give them to you with good will and gladly do I forgive you my death\\". He was then hanged, drawn and quartered.

Additionally, the Jennifer \\"postlogue\\" that was at the end of Piss Angel was given its own track ID, separating it from the previous song.

Discovery Lotosaurus is known from the holotype IVPP V 4881 (or possibly V 4880), an articulated and well-preserved skeleton. Other referred specimens include IVPP V 48013 (a skull) as well as many articulated and disarticulated skeletal remains concentrated in a bonebed which is almost completely composed of Lotosaurus bones. All known specimens of this genus were collected from this bonebed, known as the Lotosaurus site, which belongs to the Batung Formation (or alternatively Xinlingzhen Formation of the Badong Group). Further excavations in 2018 revealed many more specimens, as well as geological and environmental details of the Lotosaurus site. At least 38 individuals of various ages died within this one location. Lotosaurus was first named by Fa-kui Zhang in 1975 and the type species is Lotosaurus adentus. Lotosaurus was originally placed in its own family, Lotosauridae, which named by Zhang in 1975. The specific name is derived from the Greek a and denta, meaning \\"toothless\\", in reference to its toothless beak.  Description  Restoration Lotosaurus was long and a heavily built quadruped. It was a herbivore, shearing off leaves with its toothless, beaked jaws. Lotosaurus, like some other members of the Poposauroidea, had a sail on its back, granting it an appearance superficially similar to that of Permian pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus, although not as high.  Classification  Lotosaurus was originally thought to be a thecodont, probably related to Ctenosauriscus and other archosaur taxa with elongated neural spines (=Ctenosauriscidae). Although modern cladistic analyses have abandoned the order Thecodontia, they have also supported the theory that Lotosaurus was a distant relative of ctenosauriscids. Nesbitt (2007) was the first to suggest that Lotosaurus is more closely related to Shuvosaurus (a shuvosaurid) than to Arizonasaurus (a ctenosauriscid). In his massive revision of archosaurs which included a large cladistic analysis, Sterling J. Nesbitt (2011) found Lotosaurus to be a member of the group Poposauroidea. Poposauroids were part of Pseudosuchia, the lineage of reptiles which also includes aetosaurs, raisuchids, and modern crocodilians. Within Poposauroidea, Lotosaurus was placed as a relative of the Shuvosauridae, and therefore it is not included in the Ctenosauriscidae. Although shuvosaurids walked on two legs and lacked sails, their toothless beaks and presumed herbivorous habits resembled those of Lotosaurus. Ctenosauriscids were carnivores with many sharp teeth and high, theropod-like skulls, in contrast to Lotosaurus and shuvosaurids. Nevertheless, Lotosaurus is still considered a distant relative of ctenosauriscids, as that family is also placed within Poposauroidea. Further studies confirmed these results.  Paleoecology and taphonomy  Mounted skeleton, Henan Geological Museum The Lotosaurus site was once believed to have been as old as the Anisian stage of the early Middle Triassic, about 245-237 million years ago. However, a 2018 analysis suggested a younger date based on Uranium-Lead dating from 189 sampled Zircon grains. The youngest grain sampled gave a date of 225.6 mya, In the early Norian stage of the Late Triassic. However, this grain is an lone outlier in the sample, indicating that it may have leaked lead. Using the next youngest grains, which were clustered in a set and probably more reliable, the weighted mean age of the bonebed was found to be either 238.9 to 229.3 mya (considering the lower intercept of the U-Pb graph), or 244.3 to 228.3 mya (considering the mean age of the youngest cluster of grains). Of these two options, the former has less deviation between ages and may be more accurate. Regardless, the age of the bonebed has only a small chance of belonging to the Anisian stage, and the Lotosaurus specimens which died within the bonebed were more likely to have been alive during the Ladinian or Carnian stages of the Late Middle Triassic or early Late Triassic. A subsequent 2019 study weighted mean age of 238.0 ¬± 1.4 Ma (Ladinian) as the maximum depositional age for the sandstones preserving fossils of Lotosaurus. The Lotosaurus site was once near the northern shore of the South China Craton, a subcontinent which drifted through Tethys ocean during the Middle Triassic. The South China Craton collided with the North China Craton and the rest of Laurasia at approximately the same time as some of the estimated ages of the site. As a result, it cannot be determined if Lotosaurus was endemic to the SCC while the subcontinent remained an island, or immigrated to the SCC from the NCC after the two merged. Considering that close relatives of Lotosaurus (the shuvosaurids) lived in other regions of Pangaea around that time, the latter hypothesis is currently believed to be more likely. The mineral and microfossil composition of the site suggests that it was a subtropical environment, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. The bonebed in particular would have been part of a floodplain or stream according to ripple marks within the rocks. The large number of individuals within a small area indicate that all of the animals died at around the same time. However, their bones are well preserved and minimally scattered, indicating that the cause of death was not a catastrophic event such as a flood or mudslide. It has been suggested that the group perished due to thirst or sickness during the dry season, perhaps while gathered around an evaporating or contaminated watering hole. Their rotting carcasses would have soon afterwards been covered in water and sediment upon the arrival of the wet season, which would explain the apparent but slight scattering of bones.

Invented by Harry Cloake,, Note from Harry Cloake's son. the Cloake board consists of a queen excluder mounted to a wooden frame. The wooden frame contains a slot which allows a \\"temporary\\" floor (solid divider) to be inserted., Detailed explanation of using a Cloake board Cloake method of queen rearing The Cloake method of queen rearing involves a series of stages which divide a colony into a queenright lower colony and a queenless upper colony to improve acceptance of grafted larva, or to facilitate the creation of queen cells naturally. Stage one Cloake board insertion: The Cloake board is placed between two hive bodies when the queen is known to be in the lower hive body. Because a Cloake board either contains or is used with a queen excluder, the laying queen will be restricted to the lower hive body from this point forward. Frames containing larvae should be moved to the upper box to encourage nurse bees to come up, these will be needed to attend to the future queen cells. At this time the lower entrance to the hive is reversed so that it faces the opposite direction and then closed. Without the slide in floor in place, the Cloake Board functions as an upper entrance for workers, who re-orient to enter the hive using the upper entrance. Stage two Slide in the metal divider (insert): By sliding the divider into the Cloake board, the single functioning colony is now divided into two parts ‚Äì a queenright lower colony and a queenless upper colony. The lower entrance is re-opened, allowing bees in the queenright section to exit the hive. When those bees return, they will do so to the upper entrance, but not be able to enter the lower colony. This results in a higher population of bees in the upper colony. The upper colony is typically left alone for 24 hours for a settling period, in which the bees determine that they are queenless, and prepare to replace their missing queen. Stage three Grafted cells Installed: The queenless upper colony is now prepared to raise queens, and by inserting queen rearing bars with grafted larvae, the beekeeper provides candidates for new queens. At this time any emergency queen cells will be removed by the beekeeper. Stage three continues for one to two days, long enough for the cells to be fully accepted and built up. Stage four Rejoin colonies as a \\"Finisher\\": The slide-in-divider is removed from the Cloake board. The queen excluder continues to retain the laying queen in the lower colony while the combined colony incubates the grafted queens. The queen cells will be removed before they hatch and transferred to mating nucs. Following the removal of the ripe queen cells the cloake board can be removed to re-establish the single united colony. Alternate method ‚Äì no grafting A cloake board can also be employed to create queen cells on existing frames without grafting. The steps are basically the same as above with the following modifications: * Stage 2: Before sliding the solid divider in place, inspect the top brood box and determine there is at least one frame with new unhatched eggs. Multiple frames with new eggs will often result in multiple frames with queen cells. * Stage 3: N/A. * Stage 4: After finishing, you can either cut out the queen cells and place them in mating nucs, or place an entire frame with finished queen cells in a mating nuc.

Named for its convex triangular shape, the tround allowed the firearm's chamber to be open on one side, removing the requirement for reciprocating motion when chambering and ejecting a cartridge. It was used in several revolvers: the 10-tround Dardick Model 1100, the 11 or 15-tround Model 1500 - and the 20-tround Model 2000. Open-chamber firearm design Patent drawing of open-chamber gun Dardick (an associate of Melvin M. Johnson) began development of his open-chamber gun in the late 1940s. Dardick's patent 2,847,784, issued in August 1958, is for a pre-stressed open- chamber gun with rotatable cylinder. Essentially this design was a revolver with the exterior of the chambers opened up, forming an open U shape rather than a closed O shape found on typical revolvers. This allowed cartridges to be inserted from the side of the cylinder, rather than from the front or rear, and allowed the cylinder to be rapidly loaded from a magazine. To contain the pressure of firing, an odd number of chambers (typically three) are milled into the cylinder. The cylinder is placed, centered, in a strong frame, so that when ready to fire, the cartridge rests against one side of the frame, and the opposite side of the cylinder rests against the opposite side of the frame. Upon firing, the force is spread to the frame from the cartridge on one side and the cylinder from the other. The pre-stressed part of the design applies to the frame; it is assembled from two parts, which are machined so that the exterior part must be heated, thus expanding, before the interior part can be inserted. Upon cooling, the exterior part contracts, putting the interior frame under compression. This compression counters the pressure put upon the frame by firing. Unlike a traditional firearms cartridge, whose case is roughly cylindrical, the open chamber requires the cartridge to be otherwise. Since the cartridge contacts the frame upon firing, one side of the cartridge must match the curvature of the cylinder's exterior, while the other side of the cartridge must match the half-chamber of the cylinder. Together, the cylinder and frame form the chamber, and the cartridge must not only fit in this space, but also must seal it upon firing, and not deform to prevent cylinder rotation. At this point the rounds are not the familiar three sided shape seen in Dardick's production firearms. They are, rather, cylindrical on one side (the side facing the cylinder axis) and nearly flat on the other (the side facing the frame). This patent defined the open-chamber gun concept, however, and quickly led to the development of the tround. Triangular cartridge theory During the 1950s U.S. military experiments with feeding devices for machine guns found that triangular cartridge cases would stack into 50 percent less space than conventional round cartridge casings. Due to problems in reliably feeding a triangular cartridge from a magazine into a triangular chamber in a gun barrel, the concept was not further pursued.Ernest Lyles, \\"A brief history of the peculiar Dardick revolver and 'tround'\\", NRA Blog, 26 Sep 2016. Tround development Patent drawing of tround Dardick's patent 2,865,126, issued in late 1958, is for a new and improved cartridge for the open-chamber gun. Unlike the previous open-chamber cartridge, this version shows the symmetrical tround shape, which would facilitate feeding from a magazine, since the trounds can enter the split in any orientation and end up seating correctly. This reduced the complexity and cost of the open-chamber firearm design, making it feasible for commercial production. The trounds were constructed of either high-strength plastic or aluminum to provide strength. While trounds were only commercially available as cartridges suitable for handguns, prototype military trounds were made in larger calibers. Tround adapters While trounds could be complete firearms cartridges, many trounds were made as chamber adapters which held a standard cartridge, such as a .38 Special.Argghhh! The Home Of Two Of Jonah's Military Guys This allowed readily available ammunition to be loaded into the trounds and fired from Dardick's guns. The .22 caliber tround held standard rimfire ammunition, and the guns that could fire it were equipped with a selectable firing pin to handle centerfire trounds or trounds loaded with rimfire cartridges. SALVO trounds Dardick's patent 3,855,931, issued in 1974, expands the tround to hold multiple projectiles, firing through a set of barrels (one per projectile), making a Project SALVO‚Äìtype gun. This type of tround, holding three projectiles, was used in the H & R Firearms SPIW prototype. However it was rejected due to issues with weight (due to the three barrels) and strength of the tround when used with the high-velocity flechette ammunition.\\"Special Purpose Individual Weapons\\" at The Gun Zone Tround Terra-drill The Tround Terra-drill is described in patent 4,004,642, issued to Dardick in 1977. The Terra-drill is a drill head that combines a traditional drill bit with the SALVO tround. The tround is used to break through hard spots that the drill bit cannot readily penetrate. This version uses four ceramic bullets, which shatter upon impacting the rock, and which in turn are intended to fracture the rock to allow the drill bit to proceed. The tround is designed such that each projectile impacts the target at a slightly different time, imparting multiple shocks to create constructive interference of the shock waves in the target material.

The operating principle used was the same as a double-action revolver, with a long trigger pull serving to rotate the cylinder, cock, and release the hammer. Since the commercial trounds had the same exterior dimensions, the same firearm action would, by using a different barrel, chamber any of the calibers the trounds were chambered in. The Dardick Model 1100 had a 10-tround magazine, and was only available chambered in .38 Dardick Tround (9 mm).Blue Book of Gun Values, 13th Ed. S. P. Fjestad, p. 339 The Model 1500 came with interchangeable barrels, and was available in .38 (9 mm), .30 (7.62 mm), and .22 (5.56 mm) trounds, with a carbine conversion kit also available in .38 and .22. The Model 1500 could be configured to hold 11 or 15 trounds, and came with 4- or 6-inch barrel lengths.Numrich Gun Parts Corp. exploded parts photo of the Dardick Model 1500 A Model 2000 with a 20-tround capacity is also reported to exist. All versions used a non-removable magazine, which could be loaded with stripper clips or one round at a time. The Dardick revolvers proved to be a commercial failure, despite being, in the words of one reviewer, \\"as versatile as a six-armed monkey\\".

Pest, Austrian Empire: Rosenthal Konstantin, 1820 - July 23, 1851) was a Romanian painter and sculptor of Austrian-Jewish birth and a 1848 revolutionary, best known for his portraits and his choice of Romanian Romantic nationalist subjects. Biography=Early career Born into a Jewish merchant family in Pest (part of the Austrian Empire at the time), he left the city at the age of seventeen in order to attend the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied archaeological drawing (graduating in 1839) and made his first Romanian acquaintance, the painter Ioan D. Negulici. Rosenthal arrived in Bucharest, the capital of Wallachia, around 1842, where he was probably commissioned to paint the first in a long series of boyar's portraits. He was introduced to the liberal-radical circles by Negulici, becoming very close to C. A. Rosetti. Dissatisfied with his oil painting technique, he left for France in late 1844, he attended art courses in Paris, and began attending meetings of Wallachian and Moldavian students who expressed nationalist and radical ideals. He was accompanied by Rosetti, who praised Rosenthal's work ethic: > \\"There are many Romanians here [but] none of them have to bear the cold > Rosenthal has to [in his lodging]. Strange how the noble aim enpowers... > there truly are plenty elloquent proofs that the man shall become > great!\\".Rosetti, in Frunzetti, p.12, in ScurtƒÉ istorie..., p.63 This is the most likely date of his multiple portrait, kept only in its lithograph rendition, showing Rosetti embracing Rosenthal himself and a third, unknown person - Rosenthal painted himself wearing a phrygian cap.Frunzetti, p.23-24, 31 Wallachian revolution Lithograph of a group portrait by Rosenthal. From left: Rosenthal (wearing a phrygian cap), C. A. Rosetti, and an unknown revolutionary In 1846, the profit from his works afforded him a trip to England; upon his return to Paris, he was informed of his family's financial destitution, and left for Budapest in early 1847, only to leave in summer for Mehadia, and then, in August, for Bucharest. Rosenthal again joined the radical circles, this time as a member of the secret society FrƒÉ≈£ia, which was by then masking itself as a literary society presided by Iancu VƒÉcƒÉrescu, and was commissioned by Vasile Alecsandri to paint a portrait of the deceased Elena Negri after a daguerrotype. He also painted the portrait of Anica Manu, the wife of Aga Iancu Manu. Upon the outbreak of the revolution, Rosenthal was spared the first wave of repression ordered by Prince Gheorghe Bibescu - given the fact that he carried an Austrian passport.ScurtƒÉ istorie..., p.65 On June 18, 1848, soon after the Provisional Government took hold, Rosenthal applied for Wallachian citizenship (in theory, Romanian - as the new administrative body indicated its goal in the union of the two Danubian Principalities); the document giving him the right of naturalization justified it as \\"taking in view his talent and the active part he played in the revolution\\".Frunzetti, p.17; ScurtƒÉ istorie..., p.65 In his correspondence with Rosetti, he later testified: \\"I never would have thought that I could be as Wallachian as I am now\\".Rosenthal, in Frunzetti, p.17, in ScurtƒÉ istorie..., p.65 The Government assigned him the designing of a triumphal arch in Bucharest, one meant to mark the success of the revolution, and, probably, of a Statue of Liberty (the latter project only survives in a watercolour by Theodor Aman, Dezrobirea ≈¢iganilor - \\"The Freeing of the Gypsies\\").Frunzetti, p.18; ScurtƒÉ istorie..., p.66-67 Exile Revolutionary Romania (portrait of Maria Rosetti) In late September, after Ottoman troops intervened against the revolution, most radicals were arrested and transported on board small vessels on the Danube, to exile in various locations. Rosenthal made public his request to join them, but was answered that Austrian protection still applied to him, and, although he requested to be viewed as a Wallachian, was denied permission to board. Subsequently, he and Rosetti's wife Maria followed the ships on shore from Giurgiu to Svini≈£a, where they convinced the Austrian mayor to disarm the Ottoman guards, and allow the prisoners to go free.Frunzetti, p.20 He returned to Pest-Buda, which was still witnessing the Hungarian revolution at the time, left for Paris in May 1850, and subsequently joined Romanian exiles in carrying out propaganda work.

Persecution and killing Soon without money, Rosenthal left for Switzerland, and lived for a while in late 1850 in the town of Porrentruy, before leaving for Fribourg, then Chur, in the first days of 1851. In Graz until July, where he began receiving some attention from critics,Frunzetti, p.27 he decided to return to Wallachia in an attempt to rekindle the radical movement. His plan was divulged by spies of the Second French Republic (already under the authority of Prince-President Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte), who read Rosenthal's correspondence in Paris; the Austrians arrested the painter during his presence in Pest-Buda, citing his \\"imprudent political statements\\".Accusation rendered in Frunzetti, p.28 Pressured to reveal his connections and refusing to comply, Rosenthal was tortured to death; his body was never returned to his family.Frunzetti, p.28 In 1878, Maria Rosetti wrote a piece for Mama ≈üi Copilul magazine, in which she praised her deceased friend: > \\"[Rosenthal was] one of the best and the most loyal people that God created > after His image.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Career Dybzinski attended Collinwood High School. He attended Cleveland State University from 1974 to 1977, becoming the first of four Cleveland State alumni to play in the major leagues. He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 15th round of the 1977 amateur draft on June 7, 1977. He spent a few years in the minor leagues, playing for the Batavia Muckdogs in 1977, the Waterloo Indians in 1978, and the Tacoma Tugs in 1979. Dybzinski had 25 stolen bases each in 1978 and 1979, leading all Waterloo players and finishing second to Dell Alston in Tacoma. The Indians brought him up to the majors at the start of the 1980 season. He spent the season mostly at shortstop, serving as Tom Veryzer's backup, but also spent time at second and third base in the 114 games he played during the 1980 Cleveland Indians season. In 1981, Dybzinski played only 48 games for the Indians that season.

Graham, Jr., among others. He also served as a special legal consultant to President Richard Nixon during the congressional investigations into the Watergate break in and coverup, and for a time was the president's lead lawyer.  Early life  Wright was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 3, 1927. After graduating from Haverford High School at age 16, he earned his undergraduate degree from Wesleyan University in 1947 and law degree from Yale in 1949. Afterward, he spent a year as law clerk for Judge Charles Edward Clark of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Career  Wright taught at the University of Minnesota Law School from 1950 to 1955 and at the University of Texas School of Law from 1955 until his death in 2000. Professor Wright was a popular, if somewhat eccentric, educator, conducting class without lecture notes or even a copy of the casebook. He had a photographic memory of the materials and would often answer student questions with a correct citation, by specific page, of a case different from the one the class was studying. He always refused to call on women students, unless they volunteered, considering the traditional Socratic approach ungentlemanly to women. In response to accusations of sexism, he simply stopped requiring any student to recite unless he or she volunteered. Professor Wright's icy reserve with students disappeared completely after they graduated and joined the Bar. Many of them were pleasantly surprised to experience his warmth, kindness, gentle humor and interest in their families. He was elected a member of the American Law Institute at the age of 30, and served as its president for the last seven years of his life, from 1993 to 2000. Professor Wright organized an effective boycott of the Faculty Club at the University of Texas at Austin when operators failed to live up to their promise that the club would not be racially segregated. Wright was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy and an Honorary Fellow of Wolfson College, University of Cambridge. Wright represented President Richard Nixon on constitutional issues before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities during its 1973 investigation into the break-in the previous year at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C., and the Nixon administration's attempted cover-up of its involvement in the burglary. In this capacity, in federal district court, he argued unsuccessfully that the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches protected the president from having to turn over White House tape recordings to the Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox. After the U.S. House of Representatives, incited by the \\"Saturday Night Massacre\\", initiated impeachment proceedings against Nixon, the president shuffled his legal team, and in January 1974, James D. St. Clair supplanted Wright as Nixon's lead attorney. Wright was an active litigator before the U.S. Supreme Court (though St. Clair, not he, argued United States v. Nixon in 1974). Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg once described Wright as \\"a Colossus standing at the summit of our profession.\\" A former student teasingly suggested the diminutive Ginsburg was actually referring to Wright's 6-3 height. The politically liberal Ginsburg also referred to Wright, a Republican, as \\"the quintessential friend.\\" By the end of his life, Wright was on a first-name basis with all nine justices. Wright was also involved in both intramural and intercollegiate athletics. Wright served on the NCAA Committee on Infractions from 1973 until 1983, including five years as chair. At the University of Texas, Wright's achievements extended beyond the classroom and courtroom: Wright led the Legal Eagles ‚Äì a stunningly successful intramural football team ‚Äì to 330 wins during his 45-year involvement as coach and athletic director. He was also a member of the committee that was formed to hire a new head football coach of the University of Texas in 1997, eventually hiring Mack Brown.  Personal life and death  Wright was married to Eleanor Custis Wright; they had five children: Charles E., Norie, Margot, Henrietta and Cecily. He died on July 7, 2000 at the North Austin Medical Center in Austin, Texas, from complications following lung surgery, at the age of 72.

The 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment () is the only cavalry regiment in the French Foreign Legion. As of 2009 it was the only armoured cavalry regiment of the 6th Light Armoured Brigade. The regiment recently moved camp after being stationed at Quartier Labouche for 47 years in Orange, Vaucluse, France since it moved from Mers-el- K√©bir, Algeria in October 1967. History= Levant and Morocco from 1921  The 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment (1er REC) was created on March 8, 1921 at Sousse from elements of the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment. The title of the 1er REC would not become official until January 20, 1922, under Decree n¬∞6330-1/11 of January 20, 1922. Official Website of the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment, Section Historique 1er R√©giment √©tranger de cavalerie The cadres of the new unit were drawn from existing French cavalry regiments. Only one junior officer (Second Lieutenant Antraygue) had had previous Legion experience while one non-commissioned officer had been in service with the 1st Foreign Regiment 1er RE. Of the 156 other ranks of the newly formed 1er REC, 128 were Russians. A significant contingent hailed from the White Army of Wrangle. These included thirty officers (one a former general of the Imperial Russian Army and one a former colonel); 14 non-commissioned officers and 33 Cossacks. Most of the remainder had served as regular cavalrymen with the Wrangle forces. Beginning in 1925, the 1er REC was engaged as mounted cavalry in Syria (4th Squadron ) and in Morocco (3rd Squadron). In both theatres of operations, the Foreign Cavalry Regiment served with distinction, notably in the Levant at Messifre (September 17, 1925) and at Rachaya (from November 20 to 24, 1925). The fanion of the 1er REC received the Croix de guerre des th√©√¢tres d'op√©rations ext√©rieures with 2 palms, the fourrag√®re of the colors of the Croix de Guerre and the 1st Class Lebanese Order of Merit Medal. From 1927 to 1934, the 1er REC saw active service in Morocco (3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Squadrons), followed by patrol work along the northern border of the Sahara. In 1934 the 5th squadron was equipped with White-Laffly and Panhard armored cars. The remainder of the regiment retained horses and sabers.  World War II and Indochina War  In 1939 the two existing regiments of Foreign Cavalry were still only partially motorized. However, in 1940, the 1e REC was dispatched to France as part of the 97th Reconnaissance Group of the Infantry Division (97e GRDI). As such it was engaged in combat from May 18 (at the Somme) until the Armistice. A citation issued at the orders of the Armed Forces praised the heroism of the Legionnaires during this period. Following the Battle of France the 1er REC took up garrison duties in Tunisia. In 1943, the regiment was re-equipped with U.S. material, consisted of one light tank squadron and four armored car squadrons. Its new role was that of divisional recce regiment of the newly raised 5th Armored Division (5e DB). In 1943, the 1er REC was engaged against the Germans in Tunisia. In 1944, the 1er REC landed on the c√¥tes de Provence as one of the French armored units participating in the Liberation of France. At the end of World War II, the regimental colors were decorated with two new palms and the fourrag√®re of the Croix de Guerre. In 1946, the 1er REC embarked for Indochina. The regimental squadrons plus two autonomes groups (detached units) served for nine years in Cochinchina and Tonkin. Three new citations and the fourrag√®re of the Croix de Guerre of TOE were added to the regimental colors, while the two autonomes groups earned 6 citations.  Algeria and the modernization of the Regiment  After returning to French North Africa in 1954, the regiment was involved in the Algerian War for eight consecutive years of active service. Following the √âvian Accords and the independence of Algeria the 1er REC regrouped at the base of Mers El Kebir. It was then reassigned, on October 17, 1967, to peacetime duty in metropolitan France for the first time. The 1er REC was now based at Orange in the Quartier Labouche garrison. Reattached to the 14th Infantry Division (14th DI) on January 1, 1976; the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment returned to Africa the same year, serving in Djibouti and then Mayotte. In 1978 and 1979, the regiment participated in Op√©ration Tacaud in Tchad where an Army citation was awarded. During this period, the regiment received new equipment, including the FAMAS service rifle, MILAN anti-tank guided missiles, VAB armored personnel carriers, and the AMX-10RC armored car. From May to October 1983, the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment served in three separate deployment areas: within the ranks of the Multinational Force in Lebanon; with a tactical command headquarters stationed in Beirut; in Tchad within the combat deployment cadre of Operation Manta; and in Djibouti.

Although not very widely known, due to his erudite and often foreign- influenced style, he is considered to be Turkey's first surrealist poet. Biography √áelebi was born in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire in 1907, as the son of Mehmet Sait Halet Bey, an official of the Ottoman Ministry of Internal Affairs. Asaf Halet's surname at birth was not √áelebi, but he adopted it due to his reverence to the 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi mystic, Rumi. De descendants of Rumi established the Sufi Mevlevi Order, Mevlevi Order, Mevlevi Order website, accessed 30 June 2019 which they led for 800 years under the name or title √áelebi, translating to 'gentleman', 'well-mannered' or 'courteous'. What is √áelebi?, Mevlevi Order website, accessed 30 June 2019 Asaf Halet √áelebi, however, was not a descendant of Rumi. √áelebi studied at Galatasaray High School in Istanbul. He started his higher education at the School of Fine Arts, which he left shortly after, and continued them at the Vocational School of Law. After graduating, he worked at the Ottoman Bank and the State Maritime Administration. However, he has worked through most of his life as a librarian, and at the time of his death in 1958, he was employed as such at the Philosophy Department of the Faculty of Letters in Istanbul. Asaf Halet √áelebi died on 15 October 1958, age 51, and is buried at the Beylerbeyi K√ºpl√ºce Cemetery in √úsk√ºdar, Istanbul. Literary work In his youth √áelebi was still influenced by Ottoman court literature, but starting from 1937 he adopted Western poetic styles and techniques, such as free-form verse. In his poems one finds themes originating in the cultures of Persia and India. As a librarian, √áelebi had a lot of time and opportunity to read, and his readings stood at the base of his poetic work. An often recurring theme of his poems are philosophical ideas which he found, for instance, in Buddhism. From there he took names and terms with vast philosophical connotations, such as Siddhartha and Mara, which, for the non-initiated, created an obstacle in understanding his work, although he did provide explanations in his prose. During his youth, √áelebi wrote, without publishing them, poems in the classical Eastern formats of the ghazal and Ruba øi quatrain. He only started publishing in magazines and newspapers in 1938, becoming known for his mix of Eastern \\"exotic, mystical and warm\\" qualities with an understanding of Western culture. He became the only Turkish abstract poet of his time, basing most of his poems on fairy tales, religions or oneiric symbols. Although a fellow supporter of 'pure poetry', √áelebi's work differs from that of Yahya Kemal Beyatlƒ± in that he regards poems in a more holistic manner, and his disregard for storytelling makes him also leave the Garip movement. He even considers metre and rhyme unnecessary, but without renouncing form; instead, he searches for a new form, a position that puts him ahead of his time and makes him fit into the latest currents of today. √áelebi managed to master an understanding of Eastern and Western culture, writing articles about Eastern civilisations and Persian literature and researched Divan literature. His poetry was the result of his combined knowledge of philosophy, music, Ottoman culture, Persian culture and French poetry. This makes it a prerequisite for his readers to acquire a certain level of knowledge, too, before they can fully understand the quality of √áelebi's work. √áelebi has translated Rumi's quatrains into Turkish and French, in 1939 and 1950, respectively.

It was originally known as Baviaanskloof, but was renamed Genadendal in 1806 . Genadendal was the place of the first Teachers' Training College in South Africa, founded in 1838. Location Genadendal (Valley of Grace) is approximately 90 minutes drive east of Cape Town in the Riviersonderend Mountains, in the Overberg region. History Genadendal has a rich spiritual history and was the first mission station in southern Africa. It was founded by George Schmidt, a German missionary of the Moravian Church, who settled on 23 April 1738 in Baviaanskloof (Ravine of the Baboons) in the Riviersonderend Valley and began to evangelise among the Khoi people. The Moravian Church (originated in 1457 in Moravia, today part of the Czech Republic) had a particular zeal for mission work. Many thought that mission work among the Khoisan was attempting the impossible, but in spite of this Schmidt prevailed. He became acquainted with an impoverished and dispersed Khoi people who were practically on the threshold of complete extinction. Apart from the few Kraals, which still remained, there were already thirteen farms in the vicinity of Baviaanskloof. Within a short while Schmidt formed a small Christian congregation. He taught the Khoi to read and write, but when he began to baptise his converts there was great dissatisfaction among the Cape Dutch Reformed Church clergy. According to them, Schmidt was not an ordained minister and as such, was not permitted to administer the sacraments. Consequently, he had to abandon his work, and in 1744, after seven years at Baviaanskloof, he left the country.  Schmidt's first converts (1742)  A letter from Count Nicolaus Zinzendorf (who was a Moravian bishop) had arrived saying that he had been ordained but he died before he could go back to genadendal  Rekindling of the Mission (1792)  On Christmas Eve in 1792, Christian K√ºhnel, Daniel Schwinn and Henrik Marsveld, three Moravian missionaries, arrived at Baviaanskloof and were shown the ruins of Schmidt's house and the hamlet in which no one lived anymore. The missionaries found Mother/Moeder (Magda) Lena, one of Schmidt's first converts on a farm near Sergeants River. She played a role in keeping the faith alive by reading from the New Testament Bible that had been given to her by Schmidt. These meetings would take place under the pear tree that Schmidt had planted in Baviaanskloof. After finding Lena at Sergeants River, the missionaries held their first service under the same tree. The three missionaries quickly settled in and built a house that would adequately suit their needs. Some of the materials being taken from Schmidt's house. Thus, Baviaanskloof as a settlement had begun again. Importantly though, they were not able to put up a church as they did not have the required permit from the Dutch East India Company (VOC), and it did not seem that they would be granted one anytime soon. During the first British occupation at the Cape (1795-1803) the missionaries were permitted to build more buildings. The first building to be built was a place to worship, and the chapel was consecrated in 1796, but it soon became apparent that the chapel was too small for the congregation. According to Kr√ºger (p.77): ‚ÄúThe foundation was made of stone, the walls of clay, the roof of straw, the floor was smeared with cow-dung.‚Äù In March 1797 they built a forge, and soon one of the missionaries, K√ºhnel, who was a knife maker (cutler), began using the forge to make Hernnhut knives. These knives put Baviaanskloof on the map as a source of quality knives within the colony. The hamlet that once was had begun to flourish again. Between 1796 and 1797 the Moravian community had built a chapel, a forge, and their mill ‚Äì the mill being crucial because it meant that they no longer had to go to surrounding farms to use a mill. There were many similarities between the new settlement and the settlement of Schmidt‚Äôs time. In those years, gardens were keenly tended and used to provide food. There were many homes built of clay, Kr√ºger (p.80) writes: ‚ÄúEvery inhabitant had a vegetable garden adjoining his dwelling. The houses in the village were built of clay, some still in the shape of a bee-hive (matjieshuis) with an opening on the top for smoke, while others were square with a thatched roof. The interior was mostly unfurnished, with a kettle on the fire and hides for the night.‚Äù Lena had passed away only five days before the new church had been consecrated. This signalled the passing of the last known connection with the original settlement that Schmidt alongside her and others had started. And in 1806 in the midst of the second British occupation becoming permanent, Baviaanskloof was renamed Genadendal (Valley of Grace) by the missionaries.  Genadendal's Library (1823)  In 1823, Genadendal had its own library from where the villagers could loan books or sit and read in the reading room. There were books available in English, Dutch and German. The library became known for its bustling activity, as books were circulating so fast that demand was more than supply. The increased interaction with literature also helped politicise some villagers, aiding them in the raising of their political consciousness.  Archaeology at Genadendal  Archaeological excavations at Genadendal focused on different locations. Excavations were carried out at three shelters and at the mission station. The shelters revealed middle stone age flakes, pieces of indigenous pottery, stone tools but also contemporary glass, likely from windows and bottles. The area in the village where the excavation took place was roughly the area where Schmidt's house was said to have been, along with two other sites: K√ºhnel house and a cottage. Interestingly, there was not a lot of evidence of activity on the surface level, despite the centuries of human habitation. In the missionaries diaries, they mentioned that they took materials from Schmidt‚Äôs structure and incorporated it into their own house that they built. It was discovered that most of the ceramics found were made in the mid to late 19th century, with no real trace (except for the physical buildings) of the 18th century mission station. There were some traces of 18th century ceramics. Clift (p.82) explains that this could be the sparse nature of goods in an 18th century mission in the frontier. With regards to Schmidt‚Äôs house, there was no evidence to show the exact location of where it was, from where the excavation took place.  Genadendal Archaeology Project (1999)  The Genadendal Archaeology Project was an educational project in which the University of Cape Town's archaeological department's education outreach, known as the Research Unit for the Archaeology of Cape Town (RESUNACT) worked together with the Genadendal Mission Museum, Emil Weder High School and Swartberg Secondary School. Emil Weder High School is in Genadendal and Swartberg Secondary School is in Caledon. The aim of the project was to bring to the students resources that will help them not only understand the history of Genadendal but also to equip them with tools to research historical topics. An additional aim was also to provide educational material for the teachers and the Genadendal Mission Museum. The project was able to introduce teachers and students to the tools and techniques of archaeology, and provide a foundation, alongside support material, for students interested in exploring the history of Genadendal and surrounding areas. The students did excavations at K√ºhnel house, learnt to survey one of the old cottages on Berg Street and explored the Khoi history and origins of the region. Their work culminated in an exhibition, where they could display the knowledge they had gained, and introduce others to what the project was about.  Genadendal Residence  Genadendal Residence, the official Cape Town residence of the President of South Africa, is named after the town.

Mahone is introduced in the premiere of the second season as a special agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, specializing in manhunts for escaped prisoners for 14 years. When the protagonist of the series, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), successfully orchestrates the escape of eight prisoners from Fox River State Penitentiary, Mahone is assigned to spearhead the task force assembled to recapture the fugitives and manages to capture four of them. He is later arrested in Panama and imprisoned in Penitenciar√≠a Federal de Sona in the second-season finale. Mahone manages to escape, and is coerced into taking down the Company, a secret group of multinationals which exerts an influence on the White House. An assassin is hired by the Company to murder his son, and Mahone spends the majority of season four seeking revenge. The writers created Mahone's character in the second season so that there would be a fugitive pursuer who was not corrupt. When the writers saw that the number of antagonists was increasing, they decided to make him the alter ego of Scofield. The writers try to let Mahone inhabit a gray area, shifting the audience's sympathy for the character. Fichtner, attracted to the potential of the character, was cast as Mahone just one day before filming began for the second season; he signed on for only two seasons, but was convinced to appear in a third. Plot=Background Mahone was born in Boardman, Ohio into an abusive family, and was repeatedly beaten by his father. After joining the military Mahone was transferred to Special Ops during the Gulf War, later becoming an FBI Special Agent. The nature of his quick advancement is questioned, and many of his files are classified. He married a woman named Pamela (Callie Thorne) and they had a son, Cameron. The marriage lasts for 12 years until Mahone abruptly ends it without explanation, ordering his family out of the house. Before separating from his wife Mahone pursued Oscar Shales, a murderer whom he struggled to capture; it is revealed that Mahone killed Shales and buried the body in his backyard. Fearful that his wife would discover his secret, he cuts her out of his life. Mahone is plagued with visions of Shales, which cause him to self-medicate with prescription drugs. Season 2 Mahone in Season 2. After eight prisoners escape from the Fox River State Penitentiary, Mahone leads the investigation to capture them. Reviewing their files, he decides to concentrate his efforts on Michael Scofield, mastermind of the breakout. He tracks the escapees to Oswego, Illinois, but they manage to escape. Mahone continues to pursue Michael and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), who are able to avoid him on several occasions. While investigating a car explosion Mahone is shown to have a drug problem, swallowing pills concealed in a pen. Mahone eventually tracks down John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare) and David \\"Tweener\\" Apolskis (Lane Garrison). Mahone orders his men to shoot Abruzzi to death when he fails to surrender, and later murders Tweener in cold blood. When he returns to his office, Mahone is questioned by Internal Affairs Agent Richard Sullins (Kim Coates) about their suspicious deaths. It is revealed that Mahone was being blackmailed by Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein), a Secret Service agent forced to work for the Company. Kellerman threatens to reveal that Mahone killed Shales, and forces him to kill all the escapees in exchange for his silence. Although hesitant, Mahone agrees when an operative of the Company, Agent Kim (Reggie Lee), threatens to murder his family. Mahone continues his hunt for the remaining six escapees but is betrayed and shot by Kellerman, who transfers his allegiance to the brothers. He survives and decides to stop chasing the escapees, but is forced to resume his search when his son is injured in a car accident orchestrated by one of Kim's agents. Before returning to work, he murders the agent who arranged the accident. Mahone returns to his FBI field office, where he is informed by Agent Wheeler (Jason Davis) that Internal Affairs is investigating him. When Charles \\"Haywire\\" Patoshik (Silas Weir Mitchell) murders a civilian, Mahone asks Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) (former captain of correctional officers at Fox River) to help him find Haywire. Bellick finds Haywire, chasing him up a grain mill; Mahone climbs the mill and talks Haywire into committing suicide. Mahone's next target, Benjamin Miles \\"C-Note\\" Franklin (Rockmond Dunbar), narrowly evades him; C-Note soon offers to turn himself in, however, if his wife and child are cared for. C-Note is taken to jail, and Mahone tells him to commit suicide in order to guarantee the protection of his family. C-Note attempts suicide, but is rescued by the guards. Sullins makes a deal with him, and promises to release him if he testifies against Mahone. Because he is unable to capture Michael, Mahone orders Agent Lang (Barbara Eve Harris) to follow Michael's girlfriend Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies). Mahone's sanity begins to unravel from his determination to catch Michael and Lincoln, and from his benzodiazepine addiction. Michael and Lincoln travel to Panama, where Mahone lures them into a trap by impersonating fellow escapee Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco). He captures Lincoln and contacts Michael, ordering him to surrender Charles Westmoreland's (Muse Watson) five million dollars and his boat, the Christina Rose. Michael plants drugs on the Christina Rose, which he gives to Mahone. After an attempt to kill Kim, Mahone takes the boat and leaves; however, he is arrested on drug-possession charges. Mahone is taken to Sona along with Michael, Bellick and Fox River escapee Theodore \\"T-Bag\\" Bagwell (Robert Knepper). Season 3 Inside Sona, Mahone attempts to convince Michael to form a partnership. Michael refuses to work with him, angry because Mahone killed his father. As new prisoners, Michael and Mahone are brought before Lechero (Robert Wisdom) (a prisoner who rules Sona and its residents). When Mahone learns about the bounty placed on fellow inmate James Whistler (Chris Vance), he manages to find him and deliver him to Lechero. Mahone begins to suffer from drug withdrawal and is informed by his state-appointed lawyer that his trial is almost a full year away. When Whistler realizes that Michael is not entirely on his side, he forms an alliance with Mahone. Mahone deduces that Michael is planning to break Whistler out of the prison, and Michael eventually agrees to let him join the escape. After he begins hallucinating about Haywire, Mahone accepts heroin from T-Bag to calm himself. Agent Lang visits Mahone and offers him a deal: eight years in a St. Louis prison in exchange for testifying against the government in the Lincoln Burrows conspiracy, or multiple homicide charges if he does not cooperate. Mahone eventually accepts the offer and confesses to Lang that he killed Shales, and that guilt made him turn to drugs. Because he is unable to maintain his composure while testifying, Mahone's testimony is dismissed, and Lang is forced to return Mahone to Sona. Mahone (now rehabilitated) approaches Whistler and Michael and rejoins the escape. He is informed that their escape route (a tunnel leading to the edge of the prison) is almost complete, and that they will break out of Sona that night. Michael, Whistler, Mahone and fellow inmate McGrady (Carlo Alban) manage to escape; Lechero, T-Bag and Bellick are caught by the Sona guards. Lincoln wants to shoot Mahone in revenge for killing his father, but Whistler escapes from Lincoln's custody and Lincoln is forced to chase him. Mahone takes advantage of the situation and flees, eventually making his way to a bar. Mahone is approached by Whistler, who offers him a job in the Company with him and operative Gretchen Morgan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). Mahone warns Whistler that Gretchen is the \\"weak link\\", and that Michael will eventually hunt them down if Gretchen has indeed killed Sara. Season 4 Mahone accepts Whistler's offer to work for the Company, although the group is secretly working with Homeland Security to destroy the Company, focusing their attention on a card (code-named \\"Scylla\\"), which contains information on all of the Company's agents and operations. Whistler finds the card; however, he is killed by the Company's hitman, Wyatt (Cress Williams), who takes the card. Mahone returns to his family home to find his son has been murdered and since he is a wanted criminal, he is arrested by the police. Mahone is contacted by Agent Don Self (Michael Rapaport), a Homeland Security agent who was working with Whistler to take down the Company. He offers Mahone freedom if he joins an unofficial operation to recover Scylla from the Company. Mahone accepts, learning that other members of the operation are Michael, Lincoln, Sara, Bellick, Sucre and computer hacker and identity thief Roland Glenn (James Hiroyuki Liao). The group devises a plan to regain the card, which succeeds, however, they learn that Scylla is actually made up of six cards held by different members of The Company. The group continues to look for the other cards, while Mahone asks Lang to find out who killed his son. Mahone obtains a picture of Wyatt and meets with his estranged wife Pam, who makes him promise to hunt down and kill Wyatt. When Wyatt is captured Mahone tortures him, forcing him to apologize to his wife over the phone. He ties a cinderblock to Wyatt's wrists, and drowns him in the ocean. The group manages to complete Scylla, and Lincoln absolves Mahone for his role in his father's death. Self betrays the team and steals Scylla, forcing them to be fugitives once again. While the others hunt Self, Mahone meets with Lang and asks for help. Lang calls Wheeler to help Mahone; however, Wheeler lies to Mahone about a meeting with the Attorney General and arrests him. While transporting Mahone to the airport, Lang allows him to escape and lies to Wheeler about the direction in which he has fled. Mahone returns to help Lincoln, Self, T-Bag and Gretchen retrieve Scylla. When Gretchen is shot while trying to double-cross the team, Mahone and the others leave her for the authorities. After realizing Lincoln's mother (Christina Scofield) took Scylla, Mahone helps him stop her and retrieve Scylla after the Company threatens him with a photo of Pam. He later saves Lincoln from being assassinated by one of Christina's snipers. Mahone identifies one of the people who have connections with Christina, Vincent Sandinsky. The team does not find any connections with him and he believes his story. They catch him in the lie; after Krantz arrives to take charge they interrogate Sandinsky, who reveals some information about a hotel room. He and the team track a car rental slip and after more digging, eventually find the car (with their passports) outside the energy conference; they realize it is a set-up. It is revealed that Christina is setting the team up for the assassination of the Indian Prime Minister's son (who was thought to have brought Scylla). After the assassination of Naveen Banarjee, Mahone and Self are outside the hotel on the phone with Scofield and Burrows. The brothers tell Mahone to go the apartment where Sara is holding Christina hostage, and make Christina talk by any means necessary. Mahone goes to the apartment, finding only Sara tied up and gagged; he unties Sara and heads back to the loft, where the General and T-Bag are. Mahone, Michael and Lincoln then head to a bank, where they believe Christina is with Scylla. They enter the bank wearing masks, to avoid being recognized. They take Scylla, and when they get outside a shootout begins. Mahone and Michael get away, but Linc is caught. In the next episode, Mahone and Michael are the only ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an explosion set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln to the other side of the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there is something wrong with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael's grave at a beach. The Final Break After the FBI finds out that they believe Michael is going to try and break Sara out of prison they contact Mahone. Mahone is offered his old job back with the FBI if he agrees to give them credible information that leads to proof of Michael's plans. Mahone gives up the blind spot in the cameras that Michael had found, which the FBI fixes and then demands more information from Mahone. Mahone eventually decides not to turn his back on Michael but instead to use the connection to his advantage. Mahone informs the FBI that Michael is going to parachute into the prison, and when a dummy is parachuted into the prison Michael has enough of a distraction to break Sara out. Once Sara has escaped safely, Mahone gives her and Lincoln a tape from Michael that explained why he sacrificed himself for Sara. Season 5 In July 2016 it was revealed that Fichtner would not be reprising his role as Mahone in the upcoming fifth season. Robert Knepper told Digital Spy that \\"[writer] Paul Scheuring loves Bill Fichtner and I love Bill Fichtner. He's a brilliant actor ‚Äì but Paul honestly said to me, 'I don't know what to do with that character'. He didn't want to just bring everybody back, so that the audience go, 'Oh, look, it's Bill Fichtner again!' ‚Äì he honestly thought, 'I'm not sure where to do that in the plot.' So if someday there's another chapter of this, maybe then Bill will be back. But I think the characters that are there, each of our moments that we have, are key to the storytelling, which is how it should be.\\" Mahone's absence is somewhat explained in the final episode of the revival; in which Michael Scofield recounts to Theodore Bagwell how their mutual enemy Poseidon had been monitoring Michael's communications with anyone he believed could be a resource or ally. With those individuals, such as Mahone, unavailable; Michael is forced to turn to Bagwell himself for assistance. Characteristics Mahone is depicted as an intelligent FBI agent with \\"an amazingly sharp mind\\", quickly discovering the secret of Michael's tattoos and his plans. His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives' location, causing Michael to remark, \\"It's like he knows where we're going, what we're thinking.\\" Mahone has been described as \\"intellectually matched with Scofield\\", mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings. Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union-Tribune describes Michael as the \\"brains of the operation\\" and Mahone as his \\"arch-nemesis, sort of his equal on the other side of the law.\\" Michael and Mahone have been described as \\"two sides of the same brilliant coin\\"; however, Mahone notes, \\"there's one big difference between you and I (sic), Michael. And you just proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. Because I don't have the same reservations. I can.\\" His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to \\"get his life back\\", to which he replies \\"Absolutely.\\" Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he \\"doesn't do everything he does because he wants to do it. He's not OK about it. It's going to start to come out.\\" Mahone is not a straightforward character, and his past is revealed as the series progresses. According to series creator Paul Scheuring, the writers try to let all the characters in the show \\"inhabit a gray area.\\" Scheuring says that although Mahone's pursuit in the second season is very noble, \\"there are some things about him that we will learn that are slightly less than noble.\\" Fichtner tries to play the character with a soft side, and believes that those characterizing him as \\"a hard guy\\" are \\"missing what I'm trying to do.\\" Regarding the frequent intake of pills by Mahone, the series' executive producer and writer Matt Olmstead says: Mahone's anxiety is evident when he reaches for the varatril pills hidden inside his pen. When Mahone runs out of pills, he is tense and easily agitated. Fichtner notes the erratic behavior of his character, commenting, \\"The more twisted the better! Who wants to play a straight-away FBI guy?\\" He says that the actions that Mahone takes are affected by \\"some of the things that Mahone has in the back of his closet‚Äîand in the back of his mind, the voices he is hearing about his own life.\\" Andy Dehnart of MSNBC observes that Mahone, \\"as played by William Fichtner, always seemed to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown.\\" Although not a major characteristic, Mahone is depicted as remarkably good at unarmed combat (probably due to his military background). It is surprising when Lincoln attempts to kill him, he rapidly masters him and tries to choke him; Lincoln only manages to master him by squeezing his previous gunshot wound, only to be overcome again and have Mahone's gun on him. When one of Lechero's men attempts to stab Michael at the beginning of season three, Mahone stops him and breaks his neck in seconds. He is also the only one T-Bag believed could kill Sammy, but when the tunnel crumbles on top of Sammy Mahone rapidly masters his men. In season four when Christina Rose orders her bodyguard to kill Mahone, he beats both of them down within seconds. Development The character of Mahone was not in the original plan of the Prison Break staff writers for the second season. When the writers approached the Fox network with their plans for the second season, Fox Entertainment president Peter Liguori suggested including a fugitive pursuer who was \\"not corrupt\\"; a character who is \\"like the Tommy Lee Jones character in The Fugitive.\\" Along with Paul Kellerman and Brad Bellick, Mahone became a fugitive hunter at the start of the second season. The writers were aware of the increasing number of antagonists in the show, which led Olmstead to remark, \\"If there are too many people pursuing them, [the pursuers] are rendered inept because they're not all catching our convicts, and you can only have so many close calls.\\" The writers decided that the character of Mahone was to be a \\"very formidable\\" nemesis for the protagonists, and the \\"flip side of Michael Scofield.\\" Scheuring acknowledges comparisons made between Mahone and Les Miserables character, Inspector Javert, \\"He certainly is Javert to Michael's Valjean, but you can express it however you want. He's his nemesis.\\" One of the tricks used by the Prison Break writers is to constantly shift the sympathetic characters. Olmstead notes, \\"A white-hat character can be kind of boring.\\" Fichtner does not believe that Mahone is a \\"bad guy\\"; rather, he has \\"a lot of demons driving him.\\" Fichtner was cast as Alexander Mahone one day before filming began for the second season. After acting the previous year in the series Invasion, Fichtner did not intend to return to network television. When approached with the scripts for the first two episodes of the second season Fichtner was uncertain of his character's background, but attracted to \\"the potential of who this guy is.\\" Fichtner was given two days to decide whether he wanted to play the character and, although he was unsure if the experience would be worthwhile, he later said that he was glad to have accepted the role. Fichtner has praised the quality of writing on the series, saying \\"Television shows live or die on writing. The joy of Prison Break has been the writers. They're great and they forever challenged me, which makes the journey worth it.\\" Fichtner has also had several concerns with the scripts written for him, and talks to the writers to make sure that the character stays consistent. On at least one occasion, he has sat down with the writer and tweaked the entire script. Fichtner said that his role on Prison Break ended up being \\"a lot longer\\" than he had originally thought. He was signed on to appear for a further two seasons, after being convinced by Olmstead to appear in a fourth (and final) one. The series' move from Dallas to Los Angeles for filming was also an inducement for Fichtner, who previously had to leave his family for filming. When Olmstead asked Fichtner to return for the fourth season, his only request was to make it challenging by making his character's journey difficult. Fichtner believes that in Mahone's journey, \\"All of a sudden the blinders went up... And little by little, he's trying to make his way back.\\" He thinks that his character's journey should end with \\"something really out of the blue\\": \\"What if he totally loses it?\\" Reception Mahone is often referred to by critics as Michael's nemesis. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette found Mahone to be \\"a far more worthy adversary for Michael than prison guard Brad Bellick... who's still after the convicts but seems like a cartoon compared to the Inspector Javert-like Mahone.\\" Jeff Comings of the Arizona Daily Star comments that \\"William Fichtner is going to be the best actor on any show this season. He's brooding, sexy, enigmatic and a little scary as the FBI man waiting for the clan to cross state lines and make this a federal case. Add in the reliance on those pills he's hiding in that pen and I think I smell Emmy!\\" Brian Zoromski of IGN believes that the \\"strongest portions of 'Manhunt' deal with the introduction of a new character, an FBI agent named Alexander Mahone, played by the great character actor William Fichtner.\\" Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones praised the \\"wonderful\\" Fichtner, claiming he \\"quickly became more appealing than the brooding hero himself,\\" however, he did not enjoy Mahone's storyline in the third season. Rawson-Jones felt that Mahone had turned into a \\"gibbering, sweating wreck most of the time\\", with only \\"occasional glimpses\\" of his brilliance. Robert Bianco of USA Today said that although Fichtner was a welcome addition to the cast, he could not compensate for the \\"harebrained absurdities that have swamped this show.\\" Dehnart called Mahone the best new character of the second season, but remarked that his ability to move from various locations in a short amount of time made him seem to possess \\"the power of super fast transportation.\\" References Prison Break characters Fictional United States Army personnel Police misconduct in fiction Fictional Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel Fictional murderers Fictional characters from Michigan Fictional characters from Detroit Television characters introduced in 2006 Fictional prison escapees Fictional vigilantes Fictional drug addicts Fictional prisoners and detainees in the United States ","title":"Alexander Mahone"},{"id":"6377418","text":"Michael Krassa is the chair of \\"Human dimensions of Environmental Systems\\" and a professor in political science at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. He specializes in the interactions between humans and their environments. His early work was on how one's neighbourhood of residence influenced political views and participation. This work evolved into a larger interest in the way that the social and physical setting in which a person lives affects behaviors and attitudes. In this broader mode of inquiry, his work pioneered the idea that behaviors depend on the social and physical context. His works on neighbourhoods in Illinois, California, Missouri, and modern planned places such as Poundbury (in the UK), Seaside, Florida (USA), Kentlands, Maryland (USA), and Celebration, Florida (USA) all demonstrate that the physical setting is an important determinant of the kinds of interpersonal connections a person forms, and interpersonal connections are a strong determinant of the way the people form political views. His holistic work on suburban and urban life is not easily classified. He criticizes the New Urbanist planners for narrowness and incomplete planning, but recognizes the strong points such as planning for \\"community\\" and \\"civic engagement.\\" He highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of such communities, commending the efforts at building \\"public spaces\\" and the \\"third place,\\" but notes that, to date, most have failed to build either the racial or income diversity that was planned, and have not succeeded in creating the desired level of local employment within the community. However, he indicates that even the oldest of these are fairly new neighbourhoods, and that only time will tell. He also notes the dangers of successful local communities. Warning about deviation, \\"groupthink,\\" and self-reinforcing values, he notes that the successful New Urbanist enterprises may be in danger of building communities that embody the worst of the small town instead (or in addition to) its best. His work shows that this is avoidable in a number of ways, one of which is building cities that have a large number of diverse, successful neighbourhoods. His research on sustainable suburban development goes far beyond the political, focusing on how even far-flung suburbs might become more self-sufficient even if a majority of residents must commute some distance to work. He posits that commuter trains and trolleys provide benefits similar to remote offices, and how suburbs with retail and employment that draw on local residents are more successful than those lacking in such features. One difficulty, he notes, is that those employed in suburban jobs often commute there from a different suburb, mitigating much of the hypothesised benefit of jobs in the suburb. He indicates that the solution to this is social and political rather than design based. As a political scientist, his work shows that both the participation and voting patterns in suburban neighbourhoods vary markedly with the way that the neighbourhood is integrated with itself, and with the networking patterns of its residents. Neighbourhoods with dense internal social networks are stronger and more able to resist crime, development, pollution, and other \\"undesirable\\" features. Neighbourhoods where most residents have few internal connections are loosely organized and threats such as crime will quickly lead to \\"flight\\" or departures. The fight or flight response applies to resident decisions about whether to remain or leave a neighbourhood facing change, and Krassa shows that network density and location, as well as neighbourhood type, are important determinants of resident choice. His most influential work is an Op-Ed, \\"The Bright Side of NIMBY,\\" in which he argues that the \\"Not In My Back Yard\\" response by residents is a sign of a level of connections within a neighbourhood that in some ways demonstrates health. Although often NIMBY is seen as something bad, if the residents successfully organize to repel something they see as undesirable, it is a sign that there are interconnections within the neighbourhood that can produce desirable (as well as undesirable) consequences. His other noteworthy finding is that the decline in voter turnout for local and state elections is most dramatic in areas that have the fewest interpersonal ties within the locale. As the proportion of a person's social network lay outside the locale in which one resides declines, the chance that one votes or otherwise participates in local affairs also declines. This is important because political scientists have noted the remarkable decline in voting at all levels but especially the local. Some political scientists have also noted the increasing \\"nationalization\\" of all elections‚Äîthe idea that more and more the same issues are important everywhere. Krassa's findings may help explain this.  Bibliography  *Krassa, Michael et al.,Understanding American Government. 2004.

Following a string of sensationalist hits, Abdel Rahƒ´m became one of the most popular Egyptian sha'bƒ´ singers. Egyptian Sha'bƒ´ is a category of popular class music that can be described as urbanized folk music. In 2000, Sha'bƒÅn's breakthrough song \\"Ana Bakrah Israel\\" (I Hate Israel) accompanied by the catchy refrain \\"But I Love Amr Moussa\\", caused a great deal of controversy, and many were surprised that it passed Egyptian censors. Many of Shaaban's songs were sold informally on cheaply processed cassette tapes. His poor background, informal language, and frank lyrics have made him very popular with the Egyptian public. Since then, Sha'bƒÅn has continued to produce popular political songs, often quickly following current events. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, he produced a song titled \\"YƒÅ 'Amm 'Arabƒ´\\" (Literally: \\"Oh Arab People,\\" meaning \\"Hey Arabs\\"). His song \\"Bin Bin Bin Bin Laden\\" was on the Egyptian airwaves before startled state censors banned it.Anti-war song a hit in Egypt, by Philip Smucker in Cairo, 12 March 2003 In 2003 He got back at the top of the Arab hit parade with \\"The Attack on Iraq\\" / \\"Don't Bomb Iraq\\".BBC News: Arabs rock to anti-war song, published March 11, 2003 The hit could be heard from taxis in downtown Cairo streets: > Enough! > Chechnya!

Burke's work extends beyond the likes of contemporary musicians; often serving as a chronicle of the political and social undercurrent on the pages of Vanity Fair, Time, Vogue or The New Yorker and others.  Life  Burke was born in Buffalo, New York in 1956. He was brought up in a strict Catholic home and was baptized by his great uncle Buffalo Bishop Burke His first dabbling with caricatures date back to 1971, while a high school sophomore. Philip left Buffalo for the University of Toronto in 1974 where he drew caricatures for the University newspaper during his time there. Although he lost interest in academics, he packed up his portfolio and headed for New York City to pursue a career as an illustrator. Living in the West Village, he began drawing pen and ink caricatures for the Village Voice and various other publications. In 1982 Burke was shifting gears and began painting with oils. He signed an exclusive contract with the newly formed Vanity Fair magazine. A year later, Burke returned to his hometown, Buffalo, New York where he got married and started a family.  Work  Andy Warhol became a fan of Burke's art after seeing his illustrations in Vanity Fair. Burke bumped into Warhol on a New York street and the two became friends. After a year Burke got up enough courage to ask Warhol if he could paint him, and he agreed. By 1989 Burke's paintings of contemporary musicians began being featured on the pages of Rolling Stone magazine. Every 2 weeks the table of contents would showcase a Philip Burke interpretation of the person behind the music. In the late 1990s, Burke's work would appear on the covers of Time magazine, and continues to be published in The New Yorker, Vanity fair and GQ. When Tina Brown became editor of The New Yorker, she brought in Burke to work for her. Patricia Bradbury, former Art Director of Newsweek Magazine said \\"He is just phenomenal, he does the best caricatures I've seen, there is nobody else like him\\". New York Times art director Steven Heller says \\"Burke has changed the art form. He uses paint in a way that no other cartoonist I know uses it and in fact breaks from the tradition of caricature. Burke's work has been exhibited in a partnership with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio . The exhibit, The Color of Rock: The Art of Philip Burke, was on view at the Rock Hall from November 2006 - April 2007. The exhibit now travels throughout the United States. His original works, mainly in oil, encompass canvases from 40 inches to 12 feet in length. His subject matter has included rock performers, royalty, newsworthy politicos and entertainers from all over the globe. His work can also be viewed in the traveling Rock & Roll Hall of Fame exhibit, featured galleries throughout the US and on occasion in a \\"live painting\\" where the artist himself embellishes original or limited edition reproductions of his art. Burke's subjects range from politicos and media personalities, to athletes and musicians. Most notably his recent work featuring prominent players in the 2008 election serve as a historical reference: Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy and John McCain. Philip Burke is an artist whose work has been selected for shows and exhibits by artist's organizations such as Society of Illustrators, Society of Publication Design and Society of Newspaper Design. Philip's artwork has been highlighted in several books, including The Savage Mirror in 1993 and Rolling Stone; The Illustrated Portraits in 2000. In 2002, Burke's passion for rock and roll was displayed in an eight-foot guitar on which he depicted Pete Townshend on one side and Shirley Manson on the other. The guitar, which was Rolling Stone's entry into Cleveland's Guitar Mania exhibit, was dubbed \\"Smash Hit\\" and displayed upside down, being held by steel arms about to smash it to the floor. The guitar was on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until it sold at a United Way auction for $30,000.00. There's a lot of rock and roll in Philip Burke and a lot of Philip Burke in rock and roll. In 2019 a 24 x 48-foot mural depicting Goo Goo Dolls' members John Rzeznik and Robby Takac was painted by Burke. The mural is located at 1212 Hertel Avenue, Buffalo, NY.

This echinoderm belongs to the family Echinometridae and it can reach a maximum diameter of 16‚Äì17 cm (Barker 2007). Kina have been a traditional component of MƒÅori diet since pre-European times and has been fished commercially since 1986 in small quantities under the quota management system in restricted areas along the coast of New Zealand (Barker 2007, James et al.2007). Attempts to export E. chloroticus to Asian markets have been unsuccessful, so it may not be an economically attractive species for aquaculture development (James 2003, James 2010). Evechinus chloroticus is distributed throughout New Zealand and in some northern and southern offshore islands (Dix 1970a, Barker 2007). Habitat This sea urchin is found all around New Zealand in shallow waters around 12‚Äì14 metres deep (Barker 2007), although there are also intertidal populations in the north of both the North and South Islands (Dix 1970a). Medium size Evechinus chloroticus from Whangaparaoa Peninsula, New Zealand. Evechinus chloroticus prefers areas with moderate wave action (Barker 2007). In the north of New Zealand it is found mostly on rocky seafloor areas but also in areas of sandy seafloor (Dix 1970a, Choat and Schiel 1982). In the South Island it is also found in abundant densities throughout the fiords (Villouta et al. 2001). Individuals smaller than 1 cm of diameter are found attached under both intertidal and subtidal rocks, whereas individuals between 1‚Äì4 cm are found in intertidal and subtidal areas under the rocks, or within small depressions in rocks (Dix 1970a, Barker 2007). After the sea urchins reach 4 cm they migrate to open areas (Barker 2007). Diet Evechinus chloroticus is mainly herbivorous (Barker 2007), feeding on large brown algae, red algae and encrusting substrate (Dix 1970a). If kina populations become out of control, kelp forest can be entirely eaten away, leaving bare rocks, also known as Kina Barrens. Larval stages can feed on different species of unicellular algae in a size range between 5 and 50 ¬µm (MacEdward and Miner 2007). Predators Molluscs such as the cymatiid gastropods Charonia capax and C. rudicunda, starfish, and benthic feeding fishes can feed on individuals of E. chloroticus (Dix 1970a). The most important predators are the eleven-armed sea star, Coscinasterias calamaria, the seven-armed prickly starfish, Astrostole scabra, and the spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii (Andrew and MacDiarmid 1991, Barker 2007). Reproduction Evechinus chloroticus has an annual breeding cycle (Dix 1970b). It becomes sexually mature between 3.5-7.5 cm in diameter, depending on the population (Dix 1970b). Gonads are ripe from October and individuals can spawn from November to February (Barker 2007). Swimming larvae complete development in the water column between 4 and 6 weeks (Lamare 1998). Other studies related to larval development report development in the laboratory can take between 22 and 30 days (Dix 1969, Walker 1984). The larvae of E. chloroticus are known to settle on substrates covered with coralline algal species, such as Corallina officinalis (Walker 1984) as well as artificial surfaces (Barker 2007). High sedimentation loads in the water column, such as those associated with residential construction, have a negative effect on settling sea urchins. Evechinus chloroticus can grow between 0.8 and 1 cm in diameter only in its first year of life (Lamare and Mladenov 2000), and growth rate of in wild populations has been reported between 1‚Äì2 cm in diameter annually (Dix 1972). Aquaculture Sea urchin gonads are highly prized in some Asian and European seafood markets where demand has been increasing (James 2010). In the New Zealand market, the roe can reach NZ$70 per kg (NIWA 2005). However, because E. chloroticus is not well known in Japan and has a reputation for having a bitter taste, this sea urchin is unable to reach a high price in export markets (James 2010). Despite the fact that E. chloroticus is not a profitable species for aquaculture, there are many studies on the complete culture of this species, especially relating to roe enhancement from fished sea urchins. There is strong interest in the production of good quality roe through roe enhancement, which could allow the export of them to markets such as Japan (James and Heath 2008). Roe enhancement for only nine weeks can give the greatest return for the lowest costs (feeding and maintenance) (James and Heath 2008). Also, it is more profitable to enhance sea urchins with low gonad index which are found in the North Island rather than the South Island (James et al. 2007). The growth rate in juveniles of E. choloticus maintained in the laboratory is around 1 mm of diameter per month (Walker 1984). Maturity in this species depends on the feed quality and availability rather than the sea urchin size (Barker et al.1998). Therefore, it can reach maturity as small as 30 mm if it is fed with a prepared diet (Barker et al.1998). Artificial diets for sea urchins are well developed. However, more studies in appropriate artificial food for newly settled sea urchins are necessary as well as the design of systems for the nursery culture of post-settled sea urchins (James 2010). Toxicology Copper is having a detrimental effect on all stages of E. choloticus. For gametes, LOEC of >15 Œºg/L over one hour. For pluteus stage, LOEC of 10.4 Œºg/L over 4 days. For adults, LOEC of 50 Œºg/L over 2 weeks. References ‚Ä¢ Andrew NL, MacDiarmid AB. 1991. Interrelations between sea urchins and spiny lobsters in northeastern New Zealand.

It was founded in 1969 by noted environmentalist David Brower. The president of the organization is noted environmental advocate Erich Pica. Friends of the Earth U.S.‚Äô stated mission is to ‚Äúdefend the environment and champion a healthy and just world,‚Äù and lists its three guiding principles as sustainability, connectivity and systemic change. Friends of the Earth U.S. campaigns on issues including climate change, pollution, nuclear technology, genetic engineering, deforestation, pesticides, food and agriculture and economic policy. It is a founding member of Friends of the Earth International, the world's largest grassroots environmental network.  Background  Friends of the Earth U.S. was founded in California in 1969 by prominent environmentalist David Brower after he left the Sierra Club. The organization was launched with the help of Donald Aitken, Jerry Mander and a $200,000 donation from the personal funds of Robert O. Anderson. One of its first major campaigns was the protest of nuclear power, particularly in California. In 1971, Friends of the Earth U.S. successfully campaigned against federal funding for supersonic transport commercial airlines, and overland commercial supersonic flights were banned as well. In the early 1980s, the organization campaigned against the World Bank, claiming it was financing projects that caused tropical deforestation, among other environmental concerns. They also pushed for the 1981 moratorium on new offshore oil leasing in California, which remained in effect until 2008, when the United States Congress did not renew it. The organization merged with the Environmental Policy Center and the Oceanic Society in 1989. After the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Friends of the Earth U.S. successfully campaigned for the passage of the Oil Pollution Act in 1990.http://www.citizen.org/pc_news_issues/2010/july- aug/files/assets/search/searchtext.xml?rnd=38abe54dc76dc4f244029d87b9d32a01 In 1992, they teamed with the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe in Washington state to help pass a federal law to protect salmon runs. In 2003 the organization worked to draft and pass the Clean Car Law in California. Friends of the Earth International was founded in 1971 and today is a network of environmental organizations in 75 countries. In its early years, Friends of the Earth US was headquartered in San Francisco, but it was a largely decentralized organization, giving significant power and freedom to its local branches.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.  In 1999, Friends of the Earth represented residents near the North Tyger River in South Carolina in a case against Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc. The case addressed the industrial pollution of the river. Although Laidlaw claimed that the case was moot, since the factory responsible for polluting the river had been closed, the Court held that the plaintiff had standing to sue because the residents alleged that they would have used the river for recreational purposes, but could not because of the pollution. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the majority wrote that the ‚Äúaesthetic and recreational values of the area‚Äù had been lessened because of the defendant's repeated violations of its clean water permit.  Projects and Campaigns  Friends of the Earth U.S. runs campaigns that generally fall into four major categories, supporting the organization's overarching principles: promoting sustainability, fighting for worldwide social and economic justice and encouraging systemic change for lasting results. Climate and Energy Rally against the Keystone XL Pipeline in Washington, DC This project has several campaigns, all related to reducing pollution and carbon emissions and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources. One campaign protests the extraction of crude oil from the Athabasca tar sands in Canada's Alberta province. The controversial Keystone XL pipeline would carry oil from these tar sands to refineries along the Gulf Coast. Friends of the Earth U.S. opposes the construction of this pipeline. Friends of the Earth also works with the international community to urge countries around the world to support strong, fair and aggressive climate policy. Part of the 75-country Friends of the Earth International federation, the organization is an accredited observer organization within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Part of the overall energy program aims to prevent the construction of new nuclear power plants, protest federal subsidies for the nuclear power industry and shut down existing reactors. The campaign is currently trying to shut down the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in San Luis Obispo County in southern California. It is located near several active fault lines including the Shoreline, Hosgri, San Luis Bay and Los Osos. Friends of the Earth U.S. was founded to protest the construction of these nuclear reactors. The biofuels campaign protests the use of and subsidies for ethanol and other biogenic fuels as forms of alternative energy. Friends of the Earth U.S. also opposes the Renewable Fuel Standard, which dictates that increasing quantities of biofuels be used annually, and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) approval of high ethanol content E-15 gasoline. The organization is also involved in negotiations for an international climate agreement. Its goals include a reduction in carbon emissions, prevention of deforestation and assisting other countries to cope with the impacts of climate change and support renewable energy initiatives. Food and technology This project oversees campaigns related to agriculture and food processing techniques. One campaign is concerned with enacting stricter regulation over the emerging field of synthetic biology. Synthetic vanillin is a product that Friends of the Earth is concerned with, as its production has been associated with the destruction of endangered rainforests. Related efforts advocate for labeling and stricter regulation of genetically engineered food, or GMOs. Friends of the Earth U.S. is campaigning against AquaBounty Technologies‚Äô genetically engineered salmon that is claimed to grow twice as fast as natural salmon. It is the first type of animal genetically engineered specifically for human consumption. The nanotechnology campaign favors more industry regulations intended to protect workers and consumers and minimize the potential environmental impacts of production. The campaign also advocates for the labeling of products that contain nanomaterials such as nano-silver, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Additionally, the organization demotes the practice of factory farming, a practice where animals are raised in high stocking densities. The campaign asserts that these intensive farming techniques are unhealthy for the animals and for humans and are not sustainable. The organization's Bee Action campaign looks to address the causes of the dwindling honey bee population. As bees pollinate one third of our food supply, Friends of the Earth and many others view their decrease in number as a serious threat. The organization claims that the major is the widespread use of neonicotinoid pesticides in commercial agriculture. These pesticides became very popular in the past decade, but studies have shown that they can lead to Colony Collapse Disorder in bee hives. Major chemical manufacturers such as Bayer, Syngenta and Monsanto have disputed these claims, asserting that other factors such as mite infestation are to blame. Recently, retailers such as Home Depot and BJ's Wholesale Club have pledged to stop selling plants treated with these pesticides, and neonicotinoids have been banned by the European Union. Oceans and forests The Oceans and Forests program contains a number of campaigns covering topics ranging from international deforestation to marine pollution. The organization's international forests campaign works against the increasing trend of deforestation that is responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions. The palm oil industry has been cited as the driving force behind much of this deforestation, as well as the displacement of local farmers and communities through sometimes secretive land deals between investors and governments, also called land grabs. The Oceans Program work addresses the pollution produced by cruise ships and other ocean-going vessels. The cruise industry has been criticized for the environmental impacts of their ships such as carbon emissions, air pollution, disposal of sewage and wastewater, and oil spills. There have been technological advancements such as dockside electric power that can help reduce a ship's emissions, but they have not been widely adopted in the industry. The shipping industry specifically is said to produce a greater amount of air pollution due to its widespread use of bunker fuel. This campaign has worked to pressure the International Maritime Organization to tighten and enforce international ship emissions standards including the Polar Code. There is also a campaign to support and protect National Marine Sanctuaries and a campaign to stop the proposed increase in the export of fossil fuels from the Pacific Northwest. Economic policy Friends of the Earth, US rally in Ecuador against Chevron. This project works to change the United States and international economic policy to be more environmentally friendly and supportive of human rights. The Earth Budget campaign works to revise the U.S. tax code in a way that can benefit the environment. It protests subsidies for fossil fuel industries and other environmentally destructive practices. The campaign also works to divert federal funds for sustainable energy and public health programs. Work in this area also looks at international trade agreements and regulations. The organization is protesting the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which it claims could result in provisions that could jeopardize the environment as well as consumer rights. They are concerned about [deregulation of mining, land use and biotechnology, among other things. The campaign also protests the investment chapters of trade agreements, which in the past has allowed corporations to sue governments if they assert that government regulations hinder their potential profits. Lawsuits of this type include Renco v. Peru, Chevron v. Ecuador and Metalclad v. Mexico. The campaign also targets some World Trade Organization agreements that are said to strike down environmental regulation to encourage profits. There is also a campaign to reduce the role of corporate funding in elections and the corruption it can potentially cause. It is specifically concerned with the contributions of groups like the fossil fuels lobby, who sometimes try to influence environmental legislation. Friends of the Earth U.S. advocates for the use of public funds in the electoral process to lessen the influence of corporate interests. Another campaign advocates for the use of public funds from developed countries to help developing countries cope with the effects of climate change and adopt sustainable practices. The organization suggests the use of a Robin Hood tax, which would tax transactions in the financial sector, to fund this venture. They also support revising the tax code to close offshore tax havens and similar loopholes. The campaign also aims to make sure that the Green Climate Fund, recently established by the UNFCCC, is socially just and sustainable. In 2012, Friends of the Earth partnered BankTrack to assess the environmental and social standards of the China Development Bank. Because of China's growing role in international development finance, the bank is the world's largest development bank by total assets. The report examines how funds were raised and distributed, includes case studies and outlines best practices for development banks. Although the framework of the report criticized the bank's involvement in environmentally harmful projects, the report also recognized the potential of the bank to finance environmentally beneficial projects.  Recent achievements  Friends of the Earth U.S. has claimed victories on a number of issues in recent years. In 2013, they successfully campaigned to permanently shut down the San Onofre nuclear power plant in southern California. The price of natural gas was a consideration when the determination was made to not pursue re-opening the plant. The same year, they successfully pressured MidAmerican Energy Company to abandon its plans to build new nuclear power reactors in Iowa; it instead announced a new $1.9 billion investment to expand to its wind generation fleet. After Friends of the Earth campaigned against the genetically engineered Arctic Apple, in 2013 McDonald's and Gerber pledged not to sell or use the product. The organization has also consistently protested the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. This campaign, along with the efforts of other protestors and environmental organizations, helped to pressure the Obama administration to order a new review of the potential environmental impacts of the pipeline in 2012, further delaying its construction. The same year, they backed a bill drafted by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Keith Ellison which aimed to cut federal subsidies for the oil industry. Friends of the Earth U.S. also worked with other environmental organizations to pressure major grocery store chains such as Safeway, Kroger and Whole Foods Market to pledge to not sell AquAdvantage genetically engineered salmon, should it receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. In 2012 the Emission Control Area, which restricts airborne emissions from ships in certain sea areas, went into effect in North America after Friends of the Earth U.S. advocated for it for many years. Friends of the Earth also successfully advocated for a ban on the dumping of sewage and other wastewater from cruise ships and large ocean-going vessels in the five west coast National Marine Sanctuaries. Friends of the Earth U.S. also campaigned against the release of genetically engineered mosquitoes in Key West, Florida, and sued the FDA to further study the potential toxicity of nanomaterials in some sunscreens and other cosmetic products.

Created by Roger Stern and John Buscema, the character first appeared in The Avengers #257 (July 1985). Nebula has appeared in various adaptations of the character in other media, including animated television series and video games. Karen Gillan portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Publication history Nebula was created by writer Roger Stern and artist John Buscema, and first appeared in The Avengers #257 (July 1985). Fictional character biography Nebula on the cover of The Avengers #318 (June 1990). Art by Paul Ryan and Tom Palmer. A brutal space pirate and mercenary, Nebula seized control of Sanctuary II, a massive spaceship previously under the command of Thanos. Thanos was believed to be dead at this point, and Nebula claimed that he had been her grandfather. Nebula's band of mercenaries and pirates consisted of Skunge, Kehl, Gunthar and Levan. Nebula asked the second Captain Marvel to join her mercenary band and aid them in conquering the Skrull Empire, but she only pretended to go along with her plan. However, Firelord learned that Nebula had massacred the Xandarians. Eventually Nebula used her space fleet to attack the Skrull space armada and the Avengers.Avengers #257, 260 Nebula then schemed to gain absolute power by using Earth scientist Dr. Harker's atomic compressor to release vast amounts of energy that were absorbed by the Infinity Union. This attempt nearly triggered the end of the universe when the experiment caused a second Big Bang that came close to annihilating everything before a small group of Avengers Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Spider-Man and Sersi were able to escape the destruction and shut down the equipment in time to negate the unmaking of existence. She fought the Avengers, absorbing energies from the Infinity Union through the implant in her brain until Sersi removed the brain implant, depriving her of her powers. Nebula then escaped.Avengers #311‚Äì312, 314, 316‚Äì318 The Infinity Gauntlet The newly resurrected Thanos was offended by Nebula's claims of kinship. He reclaimed his ship and almost killed her, using the Infinity Gems. He transformed her into a grotesque virtual corpse still barely alive, leaving her as a maimed and seemingly mindless zombie, burned and disfigured by his energy beams. When he later claimed the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos boasted that Nebula was his greatest creation ‚Äî unable to die, but not truly alive either. However, when Thanos defeated Eternity and took his place, Thanos expanded his consciousness into the universe, leaving his body comatose. Nebula managed to take the Gauntlet from Thanos, using its power to restore herself to health and banish Thanos, seeking to conquer the universe herself. Thanos agreed to help a loose band of Earth heroes defeat Nebula. The group in question consisted of Adam Warlock, Doctor Strange, the Silver Surfer, Thor, the Hulk, Firelord, Doctor Doom and Drax the Destroyer‚Äî the only heroes that Strange had been able to locate in the time available to him. Nebula in interior artwork from Nova: The Human Rocket #1 (May 1999). Art by Joe Bennett. The group confronted her, and, with Thanos exploiting Nebula's inexperience with wielding the Gauntlet, she was tricked into undoing the events of his godhood and all the death and destruction he had wreaked with his power. The Cosmic Pantheon (which Thanos had earlier defeated) immediately appeared, and battled her. With Nebula thus distracted‚Äî not realizing that they were keeping her occupied by attacking her all at once, thus preventing her from thinking of a less direct method of assault‚Äî the Surfer and Warlock were able to steal the Gauntlet from her by exploiting Warlock's connection to the Soul Gem, disrupting the unity between the Infinity Gems and forcing Nebula to drop the Gauntlet. Nebula was captured by Starfox and returned to Titan for trial, while Adam Warlock claimed the Gauntlet. Nebula was later confronted by Firelord in the Titanian prison, where the murder of her abusive father was depicted in flashback which left her in a catatonic state.Silver Surfer Annual #5 Nebula was later freed from prison by her lieutenant Geatar, and converted into a cyborg by Doctor Mandibus.Silver Surfer Vol. 3 #69‚Äì73 She attempted to free her pirate crew from the \\"Anvil\\" space prison, but was thwarted by the Silver Surfer and Jack of Hearts. She killed her crew in escaping.Silver Surfer Vol. 3 #76‚Äì78 When next seen after escaping imprisonment Nebula was gallivanting as a show girl on the party planet of Syllogonia. When she spotted the Silver Surfer and the cosmic hero Genis-Vell there she feared being discovered and scurried away in a panicked flight, something that proved useless however as the petulant legacy would continually hound her whilst looking for a good time. After revealing her true identity to the space-faring do-gooder she immediately attacked him with the laser batter in her mechanical arm. A brief fight would break out between the trio where Nebula would pick up a potent energy cannon to waylay the Surfer with. Nebula would attempt to distract the Surfer by attacking a cruise ship to facilitate her escape. But in a bid to twist the knife, she instead disguised herself as his contemporary Genis in order to catch the surfer off guard. All this did was enrage her pursuer; who had grown so fed up with her antics that Norrin dismantled her firearm before transmuting her armor into a binding shell to incapacitate the brigand with long enough for deliverance to the proper authorities.Silver Surfer Vol. 3 #110 At an unknown time and date, Nebula would once again escape confinement to gather an armed force geared towards attacking Thanos's home planet of Titan, Norrin would come to his old Defenders compatriot Doctor Strange seeking aid in stopping the advancement of her recruitment drive. But the would-be pirate empress anticipated the former herald's arrival, however, and she lay in wait with her first mate Gaetar to ambush him. After having knocked the surfer out with a synaptic disruptor she had her old adversary strapped to an extraterrestrial equivalent of a fusion bomb to be sent straight down into the moon's surface. Her idea of sick revenge against the habitable astral body and the Silver Surfer for past slights. But she underestimated the recruitment that her adversary had brought with him; in her overconfidence, she left War Machine and Thunderstrike to contend with a couple of neurologically modified thugs in her army while she prepped to obliterate former captors.Secret Defenders Vol. 1 #9 Still believing she had the upper hand after Rhodes had dispatched Gaeter and infiltrated her warship, she deployed the Fusion Reactor the Surfer had been strapped too towards the planetoid; enticing her would-be captor to choose between her incarceration or saving his accomplice and billions of lives down below. Her plan would ultimately fail as Rhodey was able to disable the warhead and free the Surfer, who subsequently zipped back to Nebula's vessel and summarily dealt with her shortly afterward.Secret Defenders Vol. 1 #10 She is last seen imprisoned back on Titan with her initially assumed deceased first mate just as the Surfer and Legacy brought the loyal fellon in after having bested him and a slew of pirates while in pursuit of earth born criminals the Rhino, Nitro and Titanium Man.Secret Defenders Vol. 1 #14 Annihilation Nebula has appeared as one of Gamora's followers, 'The Graces'. In this role, she battled Ronan the Accuser alongside Stellaris. Ronan triumphed, severely wounding her.Annihilation: Ronan #2 Guardian Team-up The rogue scion would be contracted by Kindun, a living conduit to the similarly named planet which he inhabited. To bring her adopted sibling Gamorra to him seeking to enact retribution for what she and her father/mentor Thanos did in times long past.Guardians Team-Up Vol 1 #2 Nebula herself would enlist an army of Chitauri in pursuit of the Guardians of the Galaxy to accomplish this task, but ran afoul of the heroic Avengers when she and her forces ended up chasing them all the way to Earth.Guardians Team-Up Vol 1 #1 Thanos Vol. 2 Having been incensed that Taneleer Tivan, the Collector of the Universe had chosen a second ring crew of transporters to ferry sensitive goods over her. Nebula would drop in out of hyperspace to steal their cargo with a new artificially intelligent ship to aid in her larcenous endeavors; while in the middle of the heist she was pinched by her granduncle Eros aided by another Elder Tryco Slatterus, the Champion. To her surprise, she finds that this group meet was set up by Thanos's errant son Thane who had arranged this get-together for the purpose of killing his father.Thanos Vol. 2 #1 Nebula is initially unimpressed until she hears about his sudden onset of fatal sickness, the piratess remains apprehensive despite Thane's convincing argument, but he goes onto say they need a special kind of contraband in order to do the deed. Their ultimate goal is to steal precious intel by springing a special prisoner in Terrax the Terrible's personal gulag. A mercenary who once served under the Mad Titan himself who knows a special backdoor entrance into Thano's old fortress, The Black Quadrent.Thanos Vol. 2 #2 While Starfox worked to distract their unsuspecting host Nebula, Tryco and Thane made their way to the ship's brig in order to ascertain their prize. Much to Tryco and Nebula's horror, however, there was no prisoner within the ship. What was there was a Phoenix Egg, in her shortsighted anger at such deceptions Nebula shot Thane dead where he stood. Inadvertently unleashing the Phoenix onto its newest host. Realizing how badly they erred in trusting Thane, these odd bedfellows seek out the now crippled and mortal Thanos to enlist his aid in killing his enthralled son.Thanos Vol. 2 #5-7 Although her crew came to the dead, radioactive husk of Titan seeking out their needed ally; Nebula immediately attacked her former grandsire seeking to accomplish what she'd initially joined Thane's merry band to accomplish. Starfox and The Champion of the Universe did their best to try and stymie these patricidal tendencies but were unable to stem the cyborg plunderer's fury. when her granduncle tried using his powers of persuasion on her, Thanos snapped Nebula out of her trance, to which she immediately threatening to feminized him with a razor pointed at his face. She would stymie her own killing rage as Eros explained that their collaboration with the man god whom they initially set out to kill is more out of desperation now that a Phoenix empowered Thane has been loosed upon the cosmos. After hearing of Thanos's plan to find the Witches of Infinity, Nebula is less than pleased with her former lords cobbling aboard her ship without permission. But is silenced into reluctant collusion seeing as she has no real means of killing the all-powerful son of her hated liege. A few amongst their motley crew remain skeptical as to both the whereabouts and existence of this cosmic coven, until they drop out of hyperspace smack in front of a Black Hole which leads directly into their lair.Thanos Vol. 2 #8-9 Whence after Thanos and Eros vacate into the witches' domain, Tryco and Nebula grow rather restless during the wait so they consummate their passions to pass the time. The moments after their fornication are soon beset by the arrival of Thanos's mad son Thane who chases them partway across the universe even after a hyperspace jump, to which they crash land on an uncharted planet in the middle of nowhere. Just as they are about to be eviscerated by Phoenix Thane; they are saved by the untimely arrival of Thanos who, having been reinvigorated by the God Quarry, engages in an epic battle of cosmic proportions with his wayward spawn. Nebula and Champion are caught in the backlash of their cosmic conflagration, seeking space suits on her downed ship in order to escape the planet their on, Nebula is knocked out by flying debris. She awakens to find herself in the arms of Tryco whom she cuffs for carrying her, only to be caught in the resultant explosion from when Thanos smashed his son into the planet they were fighting on during a desperate escape. As the fighting escalated the two are dragged into the realm of the Stygian Witches by the contrail of the father/son conflict, Nebula is reawakened in the God Quarry by its caretaker after traversing the Black Hole knocked her unconscious again. While waking up Tryco the duo trade questionings about where they are and what all is going on, only to find Eros laying on the floor semi-conscious and half beaten to death. After the battle had been won and Thane was cast into the quarry Thanos turned his attention to his compatriots only to rebuke the lot of them and leave everyone stranded in the witches' domain with no way out. Nebula finds herself exasperated less by the fact that Thanos abandoned her again but more that she is stuck there with her granduncle and her onetime fling.Thanos Vol. 2 #10-12 Asgardians of the Galaxy Seeing no real way out the undaunted Nebula would partake of the witches' challenge and set foot within the Quarry herself. Coming out of her own desired fulfillment she would emerge from the petrification effect now capable of surviving the airless environment of the elderly watchers abode. Eager to vacate the premise Nebula is dismayed to find that Thanos has been long dead in her absence, by the hand of her hated sibling Gamorra no less. But the Cosmic Coven also inform her that there is another way for her acquire that which she truly desires, assuming she follows in the footsteps of her rival in getting it.Asgardians of the Galaxy #3 Following the Three-as-One's advice, Nebula sets out to capture a dwarven enclave in order to coerce one of their master blacksmiths into both making for her a mighty cleaver through which she can shorten distances across the universe and refurbish an artifact of biblical proportions through which she can regain her title as deadliest woman in the galaxy.Asgardians of the Galaxy #1 To that end, she would have the rest of the Dwarves tortured and ritually sacrificed by removing their fingernails before casting them out in chains to the cold and unforgiving void of space where they all froze to death. While touching down on Draeketh, planet of Temples; she and her surviving dwarven ward accompanied by an army of cutthroats, would go in search of said potent relic of Asgardian make which would enable her to claim Thanos's throne. The Naglefar Beacon, a device with which to call forth the divine cadavers boarding an armada of Norse ferries catered to the apocalyptic horns blow. As the Asgardians of the Galaxy moved in to preempt her latest genocidal schemes, Nebula waylayed Angela long enough in order to make her escape. Making her way to the planet Netredeen; she would submit the beacon to trial running by summoning the natives' childlike gods to slaughter their worshipers, having decided on such as a tactical measure to occupy her pursuers before heading off to the Shi'ar throneworld. Where she would confront Gladiator and the Imperial Guard as yet another test of the necro god callers world-ending power. Thoroughly satisfied with her latest conquest, Nebula departs the ravaged crown city of Chandilar with a swing of her axe right as the Asgardian spacefarers touched down in order to apprehend her.Asgardians of the Galaxy #2-4 Having secretly made her way to the Sol System, Nebula's first order of business was to incapacitate the Mighty Thor right before calling the Naglefar Armada down on Earth. As the Asgardians of the Galaxy managed to briefly intercept the fleet of dead deities, Nebula recognizes she'd been trapped in an illusion set by kid Loki as his associates are all seemingly cut down with relative ease. Realizing too little too late she had been distracted long enough for the real thing to board her ship. After a brief skirmish Nebula is finally bested when the beacon is taken off her hands as she lays trapped in an illusion of losing out to Gamora. After her Dwarf thrall fixes her war hatchet she teleports away again, not realizing its warp capabilities had been tampered with.Asgardians of the Galaxy #4-5 Working with the Dark Guardians In the aftermath of the \\"Infinity Wars\\" storyline, Nebula was present at Thanos' funeral. Starfox showed all the guests a recording of Thanos stating that he uploaded his consciousness into a new body before his death. The funeral was attacked by the Black Order, who stole Thanos's body and ripped open a hole in space, sending everyone into the rip.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 5 #1. Marvel Comics. Everyone was saved by the arrival of Gladiator and the Shi'ar Empire. Nebula was among those who joined up with Starfox's Dark Guardians.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics.

The team plans to track her down again.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 5 #3. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Nebula is an athletic woman, and an excellent armed and unarmed combatant. She possesses a gifted intellect and is a brilliant battle strategist.Secret Defenders Vol. 1 #9 Nebula uses blasters worn on her wrists that fire concussive blasts of unknown energy or heat blasts that can incinerate a human being almost instantly. She also apparently wears a device that enables her to disguise her appearance, either through illusion-casting or through actual molecular rearrangement of her body and clothing. Nebula briefly possessed the Infinity Union, a combination of three devices that together could channel all forms of ambient energy into her, infusing her with vast energies. Which enabled her to grow in size, be immune to physical harm, invert the Vision's intangibility, teleport, kill and recreate the Stranger, cause the universe to blink in and out of existence, project her consciousness as televised broadcasts or an energy form, and technoform any/all inorganic matter into anything she saw fit.Avengers #311‚Äì312, 314, 316‚Äì318 She also briefly possessed the Infinity Gauntlet, which held all six \\"Infinity Gems\\" of virtually unlimited power, apparently giving her absolute control of reality while she possessed them. However, her short-sightedness meant that she often made crucial errors in judgment when wielding the power, like undoing the events of Thanos's godhood without realizing that this would revert her to her near-death state and free the imprisoned Cosmic Pantheon whom Thanos had recently defeated. Nebula was later converted by Doctor Mandibus into a cyborg.Silver Surfer Vol. 3 #69‚Äì73 She was given an artificial left eye, left arm, and left shoulder. The left upper quarter of her head and part of her right hip are sheathed in metal. Her bionic limb can stretch to nearly twice its length and has a potent energy cannon in the palm of which. Nebulas optic receiver had been augmented with the addition of an accelerated probability generator implanted into her systems, giving her detailed understanding and analyzing of effective given variables related to an end goal by calculating the differing course of action one can take in order to achieve the best possible outcome geared towards reaching it.Nebula #1-2 Having won out the trial beset by the God Quarry Nebula had won her freedom and gained pseudo divinity as her prize, enabling her to breath in a cold vacuum without need of a space suit and physically match godlike adversaries.Asgardians of the Galaxy #3 For a short while Nebula wielded Asgardian weapons of incredible power in her latest scheme of power and recognition. Having coerced the Dwarf blacksmith Urzuul into crafting for her a battle ax with trans-spatial warping capabilities rivaling those of the Executioner's own weapon, allowing her to teleport over long distances and back at will.Asgardians of the Galaxy #1 Another relic she possessed crafted by the trickster god Loki was the Naglefar Beacon, a diabolical horn which controlled the as named by ships teaming with the waiting and resentful cadavers of countless dead divinities stretching along numerous pantheons.Asgardians of the Galaxy #2 Each and everyone of whom representing the leftover remains of gods present after every Ragnarok Cycle where their souls reincarnated into fresh bodies while their old corporeal vessels linger on in perpetual agony. All of whom patiently awaited the horns blow in order to beset any unsuspecting worlds with their spiteful fury at the reliquaries beck and call.Asgardians of the Galaxy #5 In other media=Television * Nebula appeared in the 1999 Silver Surfer animated series two-part episode \\"Learning Curve\\", voiced by Jennifer Dale. * Nebula appears in season two of The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Jane Lynch.

Upon reaching Ego's planet, Nebula defeats Gamora and vents her frustrations to her before helping Gamora and the Guardians kill Ego. She later reconciles with Gamora before setting out alone to kill Thanos. * Nebula returns in the 2018 film Avengers: Infinity War. Nebula was captured by Thanos following her nearly successful attempt on his life. Thanos then tortured her to coerce Gamora to take him to the Soul Stone. Nebula later escapes and joins Star-Lord, Drax, Mantis as well as Avengers members Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man on Titan to stop Thanos. They are ultimately unsuccessful as Thanos uses the completed Infinity Gauntlet to wipe out half of the universe, with Nebula and Iron Man the only ones left. * Nebula returns in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Having escaped Titan, she befriended and cared for Iron Man before they are rescued by Captain Marvel. She and the remaining Avengers track down Thanos to undo what he did, only to learn he destroyed the Infinity Stones long before they arrived. Over the course of the following five years, Nebula and Rocket work to protect the universe before joining the Avengers in a \\"time heist\\" to retrieve past versions of the Infinity Stones. While obtaining the Power Stone however, her cybernetics interface with her 2014 self and captured by the latter's Thanos before she can warn her allies. The past Nebula takes her present self's place without the Avengers realizing and brings Thanos and his army to the present. While the Avengers confront him, present Nebula manages to escape, convince a past version of Gamora to betray Thanos earlier than she intended, and kills her past self before joining the Avengers in defeating Thanos. Following the battle, Nebula joins the Guardians. In spite of how the film explains time travel, in that changes in the past do not affect the present or future, The Washington Post contends that Nebula committed a \\"retro-suicide paradox\\" when she killed her past self.

Following the death of Thanos in episode one, Gamora tells Star-Lord that part of her wants to see Nebula again. He will either tell her that Nebula is family or that calling her could be a mistake. If the former choice is made, Nebula expresses anger over how the Guardians killed their father during Gamora's call. In episode two, Nebula attacks the location where Thanos' body is being held, though Star-Lord and Gamora subdue her and lock her in Gamora's room on their ship, the Milano. Star-Lord and Gamora come to her for help in translating ancient Kree glyphs he saw in a vision, but Nebula proves reluctant. After Drax discovers a device in Nebula's head, Star-Lord persuades her to give it to him. When Kree soldiers working for Hala the Accuser attack the ship, Star-Lord will have the option to release Nebula to help fight them. In episode three, Star-Lord experiences Gamora's flashbacks of Nebula while she was being trained by Thanos before deciding whether Nebula stays or goes. Depending on the choice, Nebula will either reconcile with Gamora or join Hala's forces respectively. * Nebula is a playable character in Marvel: Contest of Champions. * Nebula appears as a boss in Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order, voiced again by Ashly Burch.

Samta Prasad Benares gharƒÅnƒÅ (Hindi: ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡§∏ ‡§ò‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡§æ) is one of the six most common styles of playing of the Indian tabla. History The Benares tabla gharana was developed a little over 200 years ago by Pandit Ram Sahai (1780‚Äì1826). At the age of nine, Ram moved to Lucknow to become a disciple of Modhu Khan of the Lucknow gharana. After some time performing in Benares, Pandit Ram Sahai felt the need to make a significant change in his tabla playing. For six months, he withdrew into seclusion, and worked to develop what is now known as the Benares baj or style of tabla playing. The philosophy behind this new style of tabla playing is that it would be versatile enough to perform solo, and to accompany any form of music or dance. The tabla would be able to play delicately, as required for khyal, or more aggressively, like pakhawaj, for the accompaniment of dhrupad or kathak dance. Ram Sahai developed a new way of fingering the tabla strokes; especially important is the sound Na, being played with a curved ring finger to allow for maximum resonance of the dahina. He also composed numerous compositions within existing compositional forms (gats, tukras, fard, parans etc.) and created new forms, such as uthan, Benarasi theka, and fard. Characteristics Today, the Benares tabla gharana is well known for its powerful sound, though Benares players are also very capable of playing delicately and sensitively. The gharana is categorized into the Purbi (eastern) baj, which includes the Farukhabad, Lucknow, and Benares gharanas. The Benares style makes use of the more resonant strokes of tabla, such as Na (played on the lao), and Din. Exponents The tabla solo is highly developed in the Benares gharana, and some artists, such as Anokhelal Mishra, Samta Prasad, and Kishan Maharaj, have become famous as tabla soloists. The direct descendants making up the 6th generation of tabla players are Mahapurush Misra, Ananda Gopal Bandopadhyay (disciple of Mahadev Prasad Mishra), and Chandra Nath Shastri (disciple of Anokhelal Mishra). The 7th generation consists of Kumar Bose (disciple of Kishan Maharaj). Other noted artists include Kanthe Maharaj, uncle and guru of Kishan Maharaj, and whose disciples were Badri Maharaj and Ashutosh Bhattacharya. The Benares baj makes use of over 20 different compositional types, and has an enormously varied repertoire of each type. Reputed players of the gharana include Anokhelal Mishra (1914‚Äì1958), Samta Prasad (1921‚Äì1994), Kishan Maharaj (1923‚Äì2008)], Ashutosh Bhattacharya (1917‚Äì2004), Chandra Nath Shastri (b. 1948), Ananda Gopal Bandopadhyay (b. 1943), Kumar Bose (b. 1953), Udai Mazumdar (b. 1970), Sandeep Das (b. 1971), and Nandan Mehta (1942‚Äì2010).

Amirthalingam was assassinated by the Tamil Tigers. Early life Amirthalingam was born 26 August 1927 in Pannagam near Vaddukoddai in northern province of Ceylon. He was the son of S. Appapillai, a retired station master, and Valliammai. He had three brothers (Sockalingam, Vasu Thevalingam and Thigamparalingam). He was educated at Meihandan Tamil School, Pannakam and Victoria College, Chulipuram. He later studied at Ceylon University College. After graduation he joined the legal profession, becoming an advocate. Amirthalingam married Mangaiyarkarasi, daughter of Vallipuram. They had two sons - Kandeepan and Baheerathan. Political career Amirthalingam joined the newly formed Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (Federal Party) in 1949 and became leader of its Youth Front.

Official Website, Department of Elections, Sri Lanka. In 1972 the ITAK, ACTC and others formed the Tamil United Front (later renamed Tamil United Liberation Front). Amirthalingam was delivering leaflets along with other leading Tamil politicians (M. Sivasithamparam, V. N. Navaratnam, K. P. Ratnam and K. Thurairatnam) in 1976 when they were all arrested on government orders. Sivasithamparam was released but the others were taken to Colombo and tried for sedition. All the defendants were acquitted after a famous trial at bar case in which 72 Tamil lawyers including S. J. V. Chelvanayakam and G. G. Ponnambalam acted for the defence. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, leader of the TULF and ITAK, died in April 1977. Amirthalingam took on the leadership of both organisations. Amirthalingam was the TULF's candidate for Kankesanthurai at the 1977 parliamentary election. He won the election and re-entered Parliament. 1977 Parliamentary Elections Results. Official Website, Department of Elections, Sri Lanka. The TULF became the largest opposition party in Parliament and Amirthalingam became Leader of the Opposition. Amirthalingam and all other TULF MPs boycotted Parliament from the middle of 1983 for a number of reasons: they were under pressure from Sri Lankan Tamil militants not to stay in Parliament beyond their normal six-year term; the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka required them to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state; and the Black July riots in which up to 3,000 Tamils were murdered by Sinhalese mobs. After three months of absence, Amirthalingam forfeited his seat in Parliament on 22 October 1983. Amirthalingam and his family, like many families of leading Tamil politicians, fled to Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu. Whilst in India Amirthalingam took part in numerous peace talks. After the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in 1987 Amirthalingam returned to Sri Lanka. Amirthalingam and his wife moved into a house in Bullers Road (Baudhaloka Mawatha) in the Cinnamon Gardens area of Colombo. The house was shared with other leading TULF politicians (M. Sivasithamparam, V. Yogeswaran and Mavai Senathirajah) and their families. Amirthalingam was one of the TULF's candidates in Batticaloa District at the 1989 parliamentary election but failed to get elected. He was however appointed as a National List Member of Parliament for the TULF after the election. Assassination In effort to bring about unity amongst the Tamils, Yogeswaran made contact with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and met with them several times. He arranged a meeting between the Tamil Tigers and the TULF leaders at their Bullers Road residence. On the evening of 13 July 1989 three men, Peter Aloysius Leon, Visu (Rasiah Aravindaram) and Sivakumar (Vignan/Arivu), arrived at the residence. Aloysius and Visu went inside the house whilst Sivakumar remained outside. The two men met with Yogeswaran, Amirthalingam and Sivasithamparam in Yogeswaran's apartment on the first floor. The meeting seemed to be going well when suddenly Visu pulled out a gun and shot Amirthalingam in the head and chest. Yogeswaran stood up but was shot by Aloysius and Visu. Security guards heard the shots and rushed in, shooting the assailants who were injured. The assailants shot Sivasithamparam in the shoulder before running downstairs. They were chased and shot dead by the security guards. Sivakumar was also shot and died later of his injuries. Amirthalingam and Yogeswaran were killed but Sivasithamparam survived.

SWA has had the dubious distinction of being considered the \\"worst\\" band to ever record for SST Records by many label aficionados and, in one infamous fanzine article, Steve Albini claimed that among the worst things a person could do was \\"listen to SWA\\" and \\"be SWA\\". However, others have come to the band's defense. The band existed from the mid 1980s until 1992 and released 5 full-length albums on SST Records, all of which are currently out of print. History Following his departure from Black Flag in 1983, Chuck Dukowski set about reforming his first band, W√ºrm. Despite recording an album, W√ºrm's reunion was short-lived. Chuck soon became acquainted with Greg Cameron, a teenaged-drummer who was hanging out and jamming around SST Records' rehearsal space. The two began playing together and were soon joined by guitarist Ted Falconi (of Flipper), but this line-up was short-lived. The group was soon rounded out by former Overkill vocalist Merrill Ward, Frantic Technoid's guitarist Richard Ford, and Greg Cameron's high school friend, Ray Cooper, also on guitar. In 1985, the band recorded their debut Your Future (If You Have One), which was produced by Chuck's former Black Flag bandmate, Greg Ginn. After the recording, Cooper departed the group to play with the Descendents, with whom he had played with off and on since 1982. Following 1986's Sex Dr. (a reference to Cameron's nickname, \\"The Nazi Sex Doctor\\"), Ford also departed, as his responsibilities as SST Record's label manager ended up leaving him with little time for the band. He was replaced by Sylvia Juncosa for 1987's XCIII. Juncosa left the group to pursue a solo career shortly afterwards. Ed Gregor replaced Sylvia, but was only in the band a short time, participating in the songs on the next album, \\"Winter\\", but left the band to go to University. Phil Van Duyne played guitar on 1989's Winter. Following Winter, Merrill Ward left SWA to pursue an acting career. The group pressed on as a trio, with Chuck Dukowski handling the bulk of the vocals on 1991's Volume, which proved to be SWA's final release. Early in SWA's existence, Dukowski and Cameron were also members of October Faction. In the mid 1990s, Dukowski and Van Duyne teamed up in the band Fishcamp.

Originally, the technique was used mostly for electric guitars: it facilitates a separation of guitar playing from guitar amplifier processing‚Äîa previously recorded audio program is played back and re-recorded at a later time for the purpose of adding effects, ambiance such as reverb or echo, and the tone shaping imbued by certain amps and cabinets. The technique has since evolved over the 2000s to include many other applications. Re-amping can also be applied to other instruments and program, such as recorded drums, synthesizers, and virtual instruments. Examples of common re-amping objectives include taking a pre-recorded electric guitar track and adding musically pleasing amplifier distortion/overdrive, room tone such as reverb, audio compression, EQ/filters, envelope followers, resonance, and gating. Re-amping is often used to \\"warm up\\" dry tracks, which often means adding complex, musically interesting effects. By playing a dry signal through a studio's main monitors and then using room mics to capture the ambiance, engineers are able to create realistic reverbs and blend the \\"wet\\" (modified) signal with the original dry recorded sound to achieve the desired amount of depth. The technique is especially useful for \\"softening\\" stereo drum tracks. By pointing the monitors away from each other and miking each speaker individually, the stereo image can be well preserved and a new sense of \\"depth\\" can be added to the track. It is important for audio engineers to check that the microphones being used are in phase to avoid problems with the mix.  Example  An electric guitarist records a dry, unprocessed, unaffected track in a recording studio. This is often achieved by connecting the guitar into a DI unit (a Direct Input or Direct Inject buffer box) that is fed to a recording console or, alternatively, bypassing the console by using an outboard preamplifier. Often, the guitarist's signal is sent to both recorder and guitar amp simultaneously, providing the guitarist with a proper amplifier \\"feel\\" while she/he is playing while also tracking (recording) a dry (un-effects processed) signal. At a later time, ranging from weeks or months later to even years later, the dry, direct, unprocessed guitar recording is fed to a bridging device (a Reamp unit or reverse DI box) to \\"re-record\\" the guitarist's unprocessed performance through a dedicated guitar amplifier cabinet and/or external effects units. The guitar amplifier is placed in the live room or isolation booth of the recording studio and is set up to produce the desired tonal quality, including distortion character and room reverberation. A microphone is placed near the guitar speaker and a new track is recorded, producing the re-amplified, processed track. The microphone cable is connected to the mixing console or mic preamp using a cable, as usual, without using a bridging device. External effects such as stomp boxes and guitar multi-fx processors can also be included in the re-amping process. As well as physical devices that require an impedance-matched guitar pickup signal, software-based virtual guitar effects and amps can be included in the re-amping process.  Advantages of re-amping  Re-amping allows guitarists and other electronic musicians to record their tracks and go home, leaving the engineer and producer to spend more time dialing in \\"just right\\" settings and effects on prerecorded tracks. When re-amping electric guitar tracks, the guitarist need not be present for the engineer to experiment long hours with a range of effects, mic positions, speaker cabinets, amplifiers, effects pedals, and overall tonality ‚Äì continuously replaying the prerecorded tracks while experimenting with new settings and tones. When a desired tone is finally achieved, the guitarist's dry performance is re-recorded, or \\"re-amped,\\" with all added effects. Manufacturers of instrument processing gear such as guitar effects, or equipment reviewers, can gather a library of dry performance tracks, performed and edited well, and then run these ideal tracks through the processing gear to demonstrate the sounds that the processing gear can produce. An unlimited number of performance playback passes, including looping, enables trying out many combinations of settings quickly, including microphone techniques. When guitar amp or amp simulator designers try various circuit component values or settings, they can use the dry tracks as prepared, always-available input test signals, and consistent reference signals. Another advantage of re-amping is that it enables producers and band members to have more options for remixing and redoing a recording a long time after the original recording. If the original recording of a song with electric guitar is done in 1985, and the electric guitarist's sound was only recorded with a mic in front of her/his combo amp or speaker cabinet, the recording will lock in the specific type of distortion, reverb, flanger processing and other effects that were used, which might sound \\"dated\\" several decades later. A producer who is tasked with doing a remix of this song 30 years later cannot \\"undo\\" or remove the distortion, reverb, chorus or flanger effects, and so there are limited options for remixing the guitar sound. On the other hand, if the engineering and production team in 1985 had simultaneously tracked (recorded) a \\"dry\\", DI out signal from the electric guitar's pickups, a producer remixing the song 30 years later could take the dry guitar signal and re-amp it through 2000s-era digital effects and speaker systems, giving a new sound to this 1985 track.  Electronic interfacing  Direct inject (DI) is a device for connecting an unbalanced, high-impedance, low-level signal (commonly a guitar pickup's signal) into audio equipment designed for a low- impedance balanced signal (such as a DAW) or audio consoles. Reverse-DI means running this same device or technique in reverse ‚Äì connecting a high-level (typically balanced, low-impedance) signal into audio equipment that was designed for low-level, unbalanced, high-impedance signals, such as a guitar amplifier. Playing back a signal from recording studio equipment directly into a guitar amplifier can cause unwanted side-effects such as input-stage distortion, treble loss or overemphasis, and ground-loop hum; thus there is sometimes a need for impedance conversion, level-matching, and ground alteration. Like running a guitar signal through a guitar effects pedal that is set to Bypass, re-amping introduces some degree of sonic degradation compared to playing a guitar live directly into a guitar amp rig. A re-amping device commonly employs a reversed Direct Inject (DI) transformer with some resistors added for level and impedance shift. Level and impedance adjustment can be achieved by adding a potentiometer or adjustable resistor. A proper re- amping device converts a balanced signal to an unbalanced signal, reduces a high studio-level (line-level) signal down to a low guitar-level signal, and shifts the output to a high instrument-level impedance (typically a guitar pickup impedance). In conventional re-amplification, a dry recorded signal is sent into a balanced XLR input. An unbalanced ¬º\\" (Tip-Sleeve) phone connector is typically used for the output, which is connected to the guitar amp rig. Some re-amping devices offer a pad (attenuator) switch to reduce a too-hot output level. Sometimes a guitar volume pedal or buffered effects pedal can work adequately for re-amping, depending on grounding, levels, and impedance. Another approach to simulating the high impedance of a guitar pickup is to use a passive DI and add a 10 K-ohm resistor in series with the signal connection inside a 1/4\\" plug.  Terminology  While \\"reverse DI\\" re-recording techniques have been used for decades, the process was popularized in part by the introduction of the Reamp device in 1993. The registered trademark \\"Reamp\\" describes a patented invention () filed in 1994 by audio engineer John Cuniberti, perhaps best known for his lifelong engineering work with guitarist Joe Satriani. The Reamp inductively couples balanced line-level sources into unbalanced guitar-level destinations (e.g., DAW output to guitar amp input) and includes a potentiometer which alters both signal level and source impedance. Derivations of the Reamp trademark, such as \\"reamping\\" and \\"re- amplification,\\" have become common terminology in professional audio to describe the process of amplified re-recording ‚Äì much like the word \\"Band-aid\\" is often used to describe adhesive bandages (see Genericized trademark).  History  The process of re-recording has been used throughout the history of recording studios. Pierre Schaeffer in the 1930s and 1940s used recorded sounds, such as trains, and played them back with ambient alteration, re- recording the net result. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Edgard Var√®se later used similar techniques.Dilberto, John. Pierre Schaeffer & Pierre Henry: Pioneers in Sampling . Electronic Musician Magazine, June 2005 Les Paul and Mary Ford recorded layered vocal harmonies and guitar parts, modifying prior tracks with effects such as ambient reverb while recording the net result together on a new track. Les Paul placed a loudspeaker at one end of a tunnel and a microphone at the other end. The loudspeaker played back previously recorded material - the microphone recorded the resulting altered sound. Roger Nichols claims to have used a guitar re-recording process (not reverse DI) in 1968, partly to spread the stress on cranked tube amps across multiple amps, one at a time. A sound would be dialed-in for several hours on one cranked guitar amplifier, and if this stress audibly wore down the amplifier components, another amplifier would be used to record the remaining work. It has been noted that Phil Spector, re-mixing the original Beatles‚Äô Let It Be master tapes in 1970, may have re-recorded dry electric guitar program through a guitar amplifier. Film sound re-recording is a time-honored practice. Sound designer Walter Murch is known for a technique called \\"worldizing\\" in which \\"real world\\" ambiance is added, via re-recording, to dry recorded program. Sound designer Nick Peck describes the worldizing process: \\"Place a speaker in a room or location with the desired aural fingerprint and position a microphone some distance from the speaker. Next, play back your original sounds through the speaker and re-record them on another recorder, capturing the sound with all the reverberant characteristics of the space. This requires much time and effort, but when only the most authentic reproduction will do, worldizing can get you there.\\"Peck, Nick.

It has rough, flaky and fibrous bark on the trunk and larger branches, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven to fifteen or more, white flowers and barrel-shaped or bell-shaped fruit. E.olida is known as \\"strawberry gum\\" in the Australian native foods trade and is commercially cultivated. The essential oil is used for flavouring, and the leaf is used in teas and as a spice.Daley's Fruit Tree Nursery,Eucalyptus - Strawberry Gum Description Eucalyptus olida is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has thick, rough, fibrous and flaky bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth white or grey bark that is shed in long ribbons from branches less than in diameter. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull bluish green, egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of dull to slightly glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seven and fifteen or more on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, about long and wide with a rounded or conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in February and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped or bell-shaped capsule with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus olida was first formally described in 1990 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (olida) is from the Latin olidus, meaning \\"smelling\\" or \\"rank\\", referring to the odour of the leaves when crushed. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt is restricted to the Timbarra Plateau and Gibraltar Range National Park where it grows in forest and woodland in shallow soil derived from granite. Uses=Essential oils The leaves of E. olida are distilled for its crystal-like essential oils used in flavouring and perfumery. The leaf oil is 98% methyl cinnamate and yield is 2-6% of fresh leaf weight.Boland, D.J., Brophy, J.J., and A.P.N.

The village is about north-east of Swindon town, where many of its inhabitants work or attend school. History The earliest documentary evidence for continuous settlement dates from the 13th century, but there is fragmentary archaeological evidence of occupation as far back as the Bronze Age. It is claimed that there were Roman remains just outside South Marston in a field belonging to Rowborough Farm, but these have long disappeared. Ermin Way, a major Roman road linking Silchester and Gloucester, passed close to the village on the south-west side, separating it from Stratton St Margaret. There was a Roman station at Durocornovium, now Covingham, one mile south of the village. The name \\"Marston\\" derives from a common Old English toponym meaning \\"marsh farm\\". This suggests that the village was founded before the Norman conquest of England in 1066, although it is not recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Documentary evidence of the village exists from about 1280, when it is mentioned as part of Highworth Hundred. South Marston became a civil parish in 1894. For church purposes, South Marston was a chapelry of Highworth until it became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1889. Industries Early in the Second World War, a Ministry of Aircraft Production shadow factory and airfield were built for Phillips & Powis Aircraft Ltd, and 1,090 Miles Master training aircraft were built there. Short Brothers Ltd also used another part of the airfield for final assembly and testing of locally-built Short Stirling bombers. Vickers- Armstrongs-Supermarine acquired the site later in the war and produced Supermarine aircraft including Spitfire, Seafire, Attacker, Swift and Scimitar there until the early 1960s. In 1985, Honda bought the airfield and turned it over to car manufacture, which continues there.Honda UK The principal book storage facility for Oxford's Bodleian Libraries has been located on South Marston Industrial Estate since 2010.

This castle, which has a fine riverside setting, belonged to the Hepburn family during the most important centuries of its existence. Since 1926, it has been the subject of a state- sponsored guardianship agreement, which is now under the auspices of Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument. It is open to the public without charge at all reasonable times. Proprietors The castle was founded as a fortified tower house by Hugo de Gourlay before 1300, making it one of the oldest constructions of its kind in Scotland. The superiority of the lands was held by the Earls of Dunbar and March. The de Gourlays, a Northumbrian family, supported the English in the Wars of Independence, and their land was forfeited by order of the Scottish Crown. Hailes Castle and lands were then confirmed upon another Northumbrian, Sir Adam de Hepburn (d. before 1371), who, in the reign of David II, had a charter of the lands of Traprain, and Southalls and Northalls (now united and called Hailes) in Haddingtonshire, as well as the lands of Mersingtoun, Cockburnspath, and Rollanstoun in Berwickshire.Paul, Sir James Balfour, The Scots Peerage, Edinburgh, 1905, under 'Bothwell':135/6 On 20 December 1451, Sir Patrick Hepburn, 1st Lord Hailes, had a Crown charter of the Lordship of Hailes and other lordships and lands, which his predecessors formerly held in heritage of the Earls of March, who again held them of the Crown in chief; also the lands of Prendergast, above Ayton, and others in the sheriffdom of Berwick, with all rights in the lands formerly held by George Dunbar, Earl of March, and forfeited by him: the whole erected into a free barony to be called the Barony of Hailes. He was one of the conservators of truces with England in 1449, 1451-7 and 1459.Paul, Sir James Balfour, The Scots Peerage, Edinburgh, 1905, under 'Bothwell':141/2 It is thought that Sir Patrick Hepburn dramatically extended the castle. A massive tower of at least four storeys was built to the west of the original construction, and a lower tower to the East to form a long north range, looming above the River Tyne. The thick curtain wall of the castle may date back to the 13th century. The east tower at Hailes Castle Sieges In 1400 it successfully withstood an attack from Harry Hotspur Percy, in league with the Earl of March. The attackers were defeated afterwards in a counter-attack led by Archibald, Master of Douglas. A successful attack by Archibald Dunbar in 1443 was followed by a massacre of the castle‚Äôs inhabitants. In July 1547, during the war of the Rough Wooing, John Lord Borthwick was made keeper of the 'place and fortalice of Halis.' He undertook to keep it 'surlie fra our auld ynemies of Ingland and all uthairis.' He agreed only to render the house to Regent Arran, and not to the Earl of Bothwell or any of the Hepburn name. If the English came, Arran promised to send 24 horsemen to defend the castle.J. Hill Burton, ed., Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1877), p. 81. After the battle of Pinkie, Lord Grey of Wilton occupied it for the English. He took possession on 21 February 1548 and wrote, \\"the house is for the bigness of such excellent beauty within, as I have seldom seen any England except the King's Majesty's, and of very good strength. Hugh Douglas of Longniddry became the keeper in English pay.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1562, vol. 1 (London, 1898), pp 81, 85. In 1567 James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, entertained Mary, Queen of Scots, at Hailes Castle. All his lands, including Hailes Castle, were later forfeited to the Scottish Crown. Oliver Cromwell partly slighted the building in 1650 after the battle of Dunbar. It later passed into the hands of the Stewarts, the Setons, and finally, in 1700, the Dalrymple of Hailes family. By the mid-19th century the castle was being used as a granary, Sir David Dalrymple, Bt., having taken advantage of the more settled times to move his family to the mansion of Newhailes. Description The vaulted cellar beneath the 15th century range. The castle stands on a promontory on the Scottish River Tyne, blocking its strategic route, and preying on the route to Edinburgh. Within the 13th century curtain wall is the 14th century keep, to which ranges were added in the next two centuries. The major remaining works is the West Tower, a square donjon, which dwarfs the remains of the central tower that the Gourlays built, probably a rebuilding on the 16th century. Fifteenth century work includes a roofless chamber in which the remains of what appear to be an ambry and a piscina suggest it was a chapel rather than a hall. There is also a vaulted basement bakehouse and brewhouse from this period. The original tower was used as a dovecot after it ceased to be occupied. Of the East Tower, only a finger of stonework remains. NotesReferences * The Castles of Scotland, by Martin Coventry, Goblinshead, 2001. * Scotland‚Äôs Castles, by Hugh Fenwick, Robert Hale, 1976.

He briefly served as the central villain of the Daredevil title. Publication history The Masked Marauder first appeared in Daredevil #16-19 (May-August 1966), and was created by Stan Lee, John Romita Sr., and Frank Giacoia. The character subsequently appears in Daredevil #22-23 (November-December 1966), #26-27 (March-April 1967), Iron Man #60-61 (July- August 1973, Werewolf by Night #42-43 (January, March 1977), and The Spectacular Spider-Man #25-28 (December 1978-March 1979). The character appears again many years later in Punisher War Journal #4 (April 2007). The Masked Marauder received an entry in the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #3 (2007). Fictional character biography=Versus Daredevil Frank Farnum was the manager of the Manhattan building in which the law offices of Nelson and Murdock reside. How and why he became the Masked Marauder has never been revealed. He first appeared as an already successful crime leader with men, money, and resources at his command. The Masked Marauder first came to the public's attention in a confrontation with Spider-Man; Spider-Man foiled his plans, but the Marauder himself escaped.Daredevil #16 He later clashed with Spider-Man again, with the same result, when he launched a big attack on the World Motors Building in order to steal a new auto engine design, the XB-390, intending to modify it into a weapon. In order to prevent Spider-Man from stopping him a third time, he ordered a half dozen of his men to impersonate Daredevil and attack Spider- Man, hoping to draw the two superheroes into conflict. When he heard of a fight between Spider-Man and Daredevil through a live news broadcast, he executed a fresh assault on the World Motors Building and stole the XB-390. However, J. Jonah Jameson set a trap by announcing the XB-390 is useless without the formula for fueling it. Falling for the deception, the Masked Marauder attacked the World Motors Building again, and his plans were yet again foiled by Spider-Man. Enraged, he defeated Spider-Man and tried to kill him, but was stopped by Daredevil. Once again, all of his men were captured. While fleeing the scene he overheard Foggy Nelson, a lawyer working out of an office in his building, insinuating to Karen Page that he is really Daredevil.Daredevil #17 Days later, he noticed Page going into the law office late one evening; his suspicious aroused, he confronted her in his civilian identity in the hope she would let slip some of Nelson's secrets (due to an editorial oversight, he is referred to as \\"Mr. Dunn\\" in this scene). However, Page gave nothing away and collapsed into a faint during their conversation.Daredevil #18 During this time he employed Nelson to draw up new leases for his building;Daredevil #18, 22 it is never revealed if this was genuinely a matter of business, or an excuse to more closely study the man that he believed to be Daredevil. Taking on new men, culled from the New York City underworld, the Marauder arranged to have the Gladiator sprung from prison. He intended to use him as glorified muscle, but the Gladiator proved very hard to tame, and the Marauder was forced to take him on as his partner. Meanwhile, he ordered his men to attack Foggy Nelson in his office. Though they failed, their attack revealed that Nelson was not in fact Daredevil.Daredevil #19 With the Gladiator, he hatched a plan to take over the Maggia by publicly defeating Daredevil, and sent an android called the Tri-Man against him. When this failed, he transported the Gladiator and Dardevil into a Colosseum movie set controlled by the Maggia. However, the Gladiator refused to continue fighting Daredevil after he saved him from the arena's lions. Bemused by his repeated failures, the Maggia told the Masked Marauder they \\"wouldn't even want you for a mascot\\".Daredevil #22-23 Still convinced there is some connection between Nelson and Daredevil, the Marauder teamed up with the Stilt-Man and kidnapped Nelson, his partner Matt Murdock (Daredevil's alter ego), and Karen Page, holding them captive in a helicopter surrounded by a force field that disintegrates anything it comes in contact with. Murdock told them Daredevil is his twin brother Mike and, while Stilt-Man searched for the non-existent Mike, changed into his costume. He fought the Marauder and unintentionally knocked him into the lethal force field.Daredevil #26-27 Battling other heroes The Masked Marauder was presumed dead until he re- appeared in Detroit some years later. He revealed that his force field disintegrator was actually a teleportation device that allowed him to escape and start over again elsewhere. With his henchmen Steele and Hacker, he stole Tony Stark's experimental space shuttle and ran afoul of Iron Man, who defeated him.Iron Man #60 Later, the Marauder again encountered Iron Man along with Jack Russell, the Werewolf by Night. His plans (with his new henchmen Pardee, Creach, and Strenk) involved creating the Tri-Animan (an android created by the merging of three animals instead of three men) to aid in his revenge against the Maggia. He failed.Werewolf by Night #42-43 When the Marauder next appeared, he had somehow become Big M, the leader of the Nefaria \\"family\\" of the Maggia. In battle with Spider-Man and Daredevil, he \\"permanently\\" blinded the web-slinger and threatened New York with his \\"bombdroid\\", a Tri-Man carrying a nuclear device. As a blinded Spider-Man succeeded in defusing the bomb, Daredevil defeated the Marauder.Spectacular Spider-Man #22-28 Post-Civil War The Masked Marauder, along with a number of low-level supervillains, was attending a viewing/funeral/barroom brawl for the Stilt-Man (killed by the Punisher), when the Punisher (posing as a bartender) poisoned their drinks before blowing the bar up.Punisher War Journal #4 They all had to get their stomachs pumped and be treated for third- degree burns.She-Hulk (volume 2) #17 Secret Invasion During the Secret Invasion storyline, the Masked Marauder was seen helping the Hood fight the Skrulls.Secret Invasion #6 Powers and abilities The Masked Marauder is a costumed criminal scientist whose helmet projects \\"opti-blasts\\" which can temporarily or permanently blind a victim. He is an engineering genius, and his inventions include the Tri-Man, the Tri-Animan, the Bombdroid, a truck with a \\"hydraulic hoist\\", a helicopter with a force field, and a teleportation device which can affect even unwitting targets who are far away. He also has modest training in the martial arts. His planning abilities and knack for inspiring trust have allowed him to command well-trained teams of henchmen. However, his plans are often spoiled by his mental quirks. He suffers from obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder and insists that his men execute his plans according to timetables that schedule each step down to the second. Even a few seconds' deviation from one of his timetables causes him to become extremely agitated.

It was then developed as Norwich International Airport. RAF Bomber Command use The airfield was first developed in 1939 and officially opened on 1 June 1940 as a bomber station. It had been built pre-war and had five C-type hangars, permanent brick and tiled buildings with central-heating and a high standard of domestic accommodation. The first aircraft there were Bristol Blenheims dispersed from No. 21 Squadron RAF at RAF Watton in 1939 but the first operational aircraft there were fighters: Supermarine Spitfires of No. 19 and No. 66 squadrons from RAF Duxford. Boulton Paul Defiants of A Flight No. 264 Squadron RAF began sorties on 12 May 1940. The first operational bomber units were No. 139 Squadron RAF and No. 114 Squadron RAF of No. 2 Group of RAF Bomber Command with the Blenheim IV. No. 114 then moved onto RAF Oulton which was a new satellite station for Horsham Two of the early visitors to the new airfield were the Right Honourable Neville Chamberlain and General Sir Alan Brooke. In August 1941, an aircraft from No. 18 Squadron RAF flying from Horsham St Faith en route to attack a power station at Gosnay, dropped a box by parachute over the south-west corner of the airfield at Saint- Omer- Longeunesse, containing a pair of legs for Wing Commander Douglas Bader who had been shot down over France and had lost his artificial limbs in the process. In December 1941 No. 105 Squadron RAF arrived from RAF Swanton Morley to begin training on the new de Havilland Mosquito fast bomber and from June 1942, the squadron carried out photographic and bombing missions over Germany. * No. 18 Squadron RAF (1941): Bristol Blenheim IV * No. 19 Squadron RAF (1940): Supermarine Spitfire I * No. 21 Squadron RAF detachment (1939‚Äì1940): Bristol Blenheim IV * No. 64 Squadron RAF (1945): North American Mustang III & IV, de Havilland Hornet F1 * No. 66 Squadron RAF (1940): Supermarine Spitfire I * No. 105 Squadron RAF (1941‚Äì1942): de Havilland Mosquito IV * No. 107 Squadron RAF detachment (1939‚Äì1941): Bristol Blenheim IV * No. 110 Squadron RAF detachment (1939‚Äì1942): Bristol Blenheim IV * No. 114 Squadron RAF (1940): Bristol Blenheim IV * No. 139 Squadron RAF (1941): Bristol Blenheim IV, (1942), de Havilland Mosquito IV United States Army Air Forces use In September 1942 Horsham St Faith was made available to the United States Army Air Forces for use by the Eighth Air Force. The USAAF designated the airfield as Station 123 (HF). USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Horsham St Faith were: * 469th Sub-Depot * 18th Weather Squadron * 60th Station Complement Squadron * Headquarters (96th Combat Bomb Wing) Regular Army Station Units included: * 1080th Signal Company * 1105th Quartermaster Company * 1119th Military Police Company * 13th Special Services Company * 1686th Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 858th Chemical Company ;319th Bombardment Group (Medium) The first USAAF tenants at the airfield was the 319th Bombardment Group (Medium), arriving from RAF Shipdham on 4 October 1942. Flying the Martin B-26 Marauder medium bomber, the group stayed until 11 November when the group reassigned to Twelfth Air Force as part of the North African Campaign at Saint-Leu Airfield, Algeria. The airfield then lay unused over the winter. ;56th Fighter Group P-47 of the 61st Fighter Squadron With the departure of the Marauders to North Africa, the next USAAF group to use Horsham St Faith was the 56th Fighter Group, transferring from RAF Kings Cliffe on 6 April 1943. The group consisted of the following squadrons: * 61st Fighter Squadron (HV) * 62d Fighter Squadron (LM) * 63d Fighter Squadron (UN) The group entered combat with a fighter sweep in the area of St Omer on 13 April 1943, and flew numerous missions over France, the Low Countries, and Germany to escort bombers that attacked industrial establishments, V-weapon sites, submarine pens, and other targets on the Continent. On 8 July, the group had to move to RAF Halesworth when work started on enlarging Horsham St Faith for use as a heavy bomber station with hard surface runways and concrete hardstands and a perimeter track. The move was not particularly popular with the men of the 56th who had to give up the comparative comfort of Horsham's barracks for the temporary hut (and muddy) accommodations at Halesworth. ;458th Bombardment Group (Heavy) B-24s of the 753d and 754th Bomb Squadrons on a mission from Horsham St Faith. With runway construction finished, The 458th Bombardment Group (Heavy), arrived at Horsham St Faith late in January 1944 from Tonopah Army Airfield Nevada. The group flew its first mission on 24 February with Consolidated B-24 Liberators. On 2 March a heavily loaded bomber taking off crashed on nearby Hellesdon which was under the flightpath. In September 1944, like other bomber groups in the area it participated in shipping fuel for American forces to France. The group flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945, flying 240 missions losing 47 aircraft in combat along with another 18 before returning to Sioux Falls AAF South Dakota in July 1945. Postwar Royal Air Force use The airfield was transferred to RAF Fighter Command on 10 July 1945 when it was occupied by four Gloster Meteor Squadrons one of which. No. 307, was entirely composed of Polish personnel. Meteor jet aircraft arrived during 1946-48 and in June, an echo of the airfield's former occupants was provided by a visit by a Swedish North American P-51 Mustang squadron. RAF Horsham St Faith was a front-line RAF station for many years, and its squadrons participated in many post-war exercises. * No. 23 Squadron RAF (1952): de Havilland Vampire NF10, (1955‚Äì1956), English Electric Canberra (1956‚Äì1957), de Havilland Venom NF3, (1958‚Äì1959 & 1960) Gloster Javelin FAW4 & FAW7 * No. 34 Squadron RAF (1949‚Äì1951): various target and target towing aircraft * No. 65 Squadron RAF (1946): Supermarine Spitfire LF16E, de Havilland Hornet F1 * No. 74 Squadron RAF (1946‚Äì1950): Gloster Meteor F3 & F4 * No. 118 Squadron RAF (1945‚Äì1946): North American Mustang III * No. 141 Squadron RAF (1955‚Äì1956): de Havilland Venom NF3 * No. 228 Squadron RAF detachment (1959‚Äì1964): Bristol Sycamore HR14 then Westland Whirlwind HAR2, HAR4 & HAR10 * No. 245 Squadron RAF (1946‚Äì1955): Gloster Meteor F3, F4 & F8 * No. 257 Squadron RAF (1947‚Äì1950): Gloster Meteor F3, F4 & F8 * No. 263 Squadron RAF (1947‚Äì1950): Gloster Meteor F3, F4 & F8 * No. 275 Squadron RAF detachment (1957‚Äì1959): Bristol Sycamore HR14, Westland Whirlwind HAR2 & HAR4 * No. 307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron (1945‚Äì1946): de Havilland Mosquito XXX * No. 695 Squadron RAF (1945‚Äì1949): various target and target towing aircraft The station was deactivated on 1 August 1963. Units The following units were here at some point: Current use With the end of military control, RAF Horsham St Faith was redeveloped into Norwich International Airport. Most of the World War II buildings remain, although converted for a variety of purposes. Three of the five large pre-war hangars are still being used for aircraft maintenance. Two have been converted for commercial use. The control tower still exists although the top has been restored and a new tower has been built adjacent to the present main runway. Other wartime buildings now form part of the airport industrial estate (owned by the County and City Councils) and are intermingled with many newer structures. The former RAF accommodation blocks situated towards Catton were until 1993 used by the University of East Anglia as accommodation for students. Known to students as \\"Fifers Lane\\" or \\"Horsham\\" halls, these have since been demolished and the site redeveloped as housing. The remaining MOD property, formerly airmen's quarters, has become married quarters for nearby RAF stations. Whilst most runways and taxi-tracks from the military airfield remain, only one runway is primarily used, east‚Äìwest runway 09‚Äì27, which was extended eastwards by the RAF in 1956, to avoid take-offs and landings over built-up areas. A section of the old main runway is currently used for light aircraft. Adjacent to the airport terminal building opened in 1988 there is a memorial display relating to the USAAF, consisting of photographs, paintings, and a plaque commemorating the American use of the airfield. Behind the modern control tower, and now on a section of the former airfield isolated by the Norwich Northern Distributor Road, is the City of Norwich Aviation Museum.

It combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction. Formed in 1998, ICMEC heads a global missing children's network of 29 countries. The organization has trained law enforcement personnel from 121 countries, works with law enforcement in over 100 countries, and has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child sexual abuse material. ICMEC also encourages the creation of national operational centers built on a public-private partnership model, and leads global financial and industry coalitions to eradicate child sexual exploitation and child pornography. The Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy is the International Centre's research arm. In August 2008, ICMEC was granted \\"Special Consultative Status\\" by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), to assist the UN with its expertise regarding child sexual exploitation and child abduction. ICMEC also works with the intergovernmental organization INTERPOL, the inter-continental organization the Organization of American States (the OAS), and the Hague Conference on Private International Law. History In 1998, the Board of Directors of the United States' National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) approved the creation of the International Centre; the two now act as sister organizations. ICMEC combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction. ICMEC held its first Board of Directors meeting in May 1998. It was officially launched in April 1999 at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., by Hillary Clinton, then-First Lady of the United States, and Cherie Blair, wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Ernie Allen served as President & CEO of both NCMEC and ICMEC for 15 years. Allen retired from NCMEC in 2012, and in 2014 announced his retirement from ICMEC as well. In November 2014, Ambassador Maura Harty was appointed President & CEO of ICMEC. In May 2019, the organization appointed Paul Shapiro as CEO. Board of directors ICMEC Board of Directors The Board of Directors of ICMEC includes: Franz Humer, Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, Dennis DeConcini, Victor Halberstadt, Jeff Koons, Osamu Nagayama, Raymond F. Schinazi, Patty Wetterling (in purple). Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy In 2007, American artist Jeff Koons, along with his wife Justine, founded the Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy. It is the International Centre's research arm.Ingrid Sischy (July 2014) \\"Jeff Koons Is Back!\\", Vanity Fair As highlighted by articles over the years, including a Wall Street Journal article entitled \\"Pooling Resources to Fight Child Abuse and Abduction\\", the issue of child abduction is personal to Koons. Following the end of his marriage to Hungarian-born Italian porn actress Ilona Staller in 1994, as she wanted to continue to perform as a porn actress and Koons wanted them to be monogamous, Staller, in violation of a US court order, left with their then-two-year-old son, Ludwig and took the child to Italy. After Koons spent millions of dollars in legal fees over a five-year period pursuing parental rights to his young son, the Italian Supreme Court failed to recognize the couples' US-based joint custody agreement and instead sided with Staller. This loss for Koons led him to establish the Koons Family Institute, and devote over $4.3 million to the International Centre's work. In addition, Koons' 2010 partnership with Kiehl's to design the artwork for a limited edition moisturizer line raised $200,000 for the Koons Family Institute.Helen Werbe (December 2, 2010). \\"Kiehls and Koons Collaborate to Protect Children Around the World\\" , Vanity Fair In 2006, the International Centre published a report of findings on the presence of child pornography legislation in the then-184 INTERPOL member countries. It later updated this information, in subsequent editions, to include 196 UN member countries. The report, entitled \\"Child Pornography: Model Legislation & Global Review,\\" assesses whether national legislation: > (1) exists with specific regard to child pornography; (2) provides a > definition of child pornography; (3) expressly criminalizes computer- > facilitated offenses; (4) criminalizes the knowing possession of child > pornography, regardless of intent to distribute; and (5) requires ISPs to > report suspected child pornography to law enforcement or to some other > mandated agency. ICMEC stated that it found in its initial report that only 27 countries had legislation needed to deal with child pornography offenses, while 95 countries did not have any legislation that specifically addressed child pornography, making child pornography a global issue worsened by the inadequacies of domestic legislation.\\"Model Legislation Update: Since the Beginning\\", ICMEC. April 2010. The 7th Edition Report found that still only 69 countries had legislation needed to deal with child pornography offenses, while 53 did not have any legislation specifically addressing the problem. Over seven years of research from 2006‚Äì12, ICMEC and the Institute report that they have worked with 100 countries that have revised or put in place new child pornography laws.Permanent Bureau (February 2004), \\"Strategic Plan Update, submitted by the Permanent Bureau\\", Hague Conference on Private International Law, Preliminary Document # 14, p. 6The Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy (2012) \\"Child Pornography: Model Legislation & Global Review\\" , 7th Edition In June 2009, the Koons Family Institute partnered with The Protection Project at Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, creating the Child Protection Project, to draft a model law focusing on the issues of child protection; in particular: \\"neglect, abuse, maltreatment, and exploitation\\". The primary objectives of the Child Protection Project are to: \\"research existing child protection laws in the 193 member states of the United Nations (UN); convene a series of regional expert working group meetings to establish a common definition for 'child protection;' create a database of national legislation and case law on child protection issues from around the world; and draft, publish, and globally disseminate model child protection legislation.\\"Katai de Mello Dantas (August 1, 2011) \\"Protecting Children from Exploitation: Discussions on Creating a Model Law and a Parliamentary Guide\\" , Peace & Collaborative Development Network The drafting process included six expert group meetings, held in Singapore, Egypt, Costa Rica, Spain, Turkey, and the US. The final version of the Child Protection Model Law was published in January 2013. It was presented to the members of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child during its 62nd Session in Geneva, Switzerland, in January 2013.

ICMEC's YouTube channel, \\"Don'tYouForgetAboutMe,\\" which lets people post videos, images, and information about their missing children, was launched that year as a part of these efforts, and had 2,200 members.\\"'You have to blank out the dark thoughts'\\", The Guardian, August 9, 2007. ICMEC reviews the postings to ensure that any child in a posted video is in fact missing, that authorities are aware that the child is missing, and that the images are not inappropriate. Law enforcement training ICMEC's child protection work includes training law enforcement officers. Since 2003, along with INTERPOL and Microsoft Corporation, which contributed $1.5 million to the global law enforcement training program, ICMEC has trained officers in methods of investigating cases of child sexual abuse and exploitation.\\"Microsoft, ICMEC and Interpol train law enforcers to prevent online crimes against children\\", Microsoft, January 17, 2007. , ICMEC had conducted more than 50 such law enforcement training sessions, of greater than 5,000 law enforcement officers from more than 120 countries. The Hague, UN, INTERPOL, and the OAS  In 2003, ICMEC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the goal of which is to raise money for projects that interest both organizations. In August 2008, ICMEC was granted \\"Special Consultative Status\\" by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), to assist the UN with its expertise regarding child sexual exploitation and child abduction. ICMEC also works with the intergovernmental organization INTERPOL, the inter-continental organization the Organization of American States (the OAS), the Hague Conference on Private International Law, and law enforcement and elected officials in a number of countries. Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography In 2006, ICMEC, NCMEC, and a number of banks, credit card companies, and electronic and third party payment networks created the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography (FCACP). The Financial Coalition consists of 34 banks, payment companies, and internet services companies.\\"Leading Brazilian Bank Joins International Fight Against Child Pornography; Banco Bradesco is the First Institution in the Latin America Region to Join the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography\\" , WLOX 13, November 12, 2008 The Financial Coalition, whose members account for 90% of the US payments industry, aims to eliminate the ability of vendors and buyers to purchase child pornography, by closing payment accounts they use to buy and sell illegal child pornography.\\"The Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography (FCACP)\\", International Telecommunication Union In 2007, the FCACP developed and published a best practices guide for financial institutions, entitled \\"Internet Merchant Acquisition and Monitoring Best Practices for Prevention and Detection of Commercial Child Pornography\\".\\"Internet Merchant Acquisition and Monitoring Best Practices for Prevention and Detection of Commercial Child Pornography\\" , ICMEC.

In 2008, the Coalition published a second paper, entitled \\"Trends in Migration, Hosting and Payment for Commercial Child Pornography Websites.\\" This U.S.-based effort expanded regionally with the creation of the Asia Pacific Financial Coalition in August 2009. The Coalition's initial objective was to make people and companies aware of the issue of online child sexual abuse, and how its sale and distribution was being conducted across payment and technology platforms. In 2013, the Asia Pacific FCACP/ICMEC published \\"Confronting New Challenges in the Fight Against Child Pornography: Best Practices to Help File Hosting and File Sharing Companies Fight the Distribution of Child Sexual Exploitation Content.\\"\\"Confronting New Challenges in the Fight Against Child Pornography: Best Practices to Help File Hosting and File Sharing Companies Fight the Distribution of Child Sexual Exploitation Content\\" , ICMEC, September 2013 Project VIC ICMEC manages and supports Project VIC. It is an image and video hash-sharing initiative that streamlines investigative workflows and narrows the focus of law enforcement investigations by filtering the material investigators find on offenders' computers. Using robust hash sets, Project VIC technology allows law enforcement to determine which images retrieved have already been identified, and are part of the Project's database of millions of digital hashes of child porn, enabling detectives to focus on those that are new children waiting to be located and recovered.\\"New Fingerprinting Technology to Remove Child Pornography Online\\", Friend Media Technology Systems The initiative uses donated technologies, such as Microsoft's Photo DNA, which creates a \\"fingerprint\\" that can be used to uniquely identify an individual photo.\\"Microsoft's response to the consultation on the European Commission Communication on the Rights of the Child (2011‚Äì2014)\\", European Commission The technology also assists online service providers, by helping them detect child sexual abuse images shared on their sites, and block their continued dissemination. In addition, in April 2014 the British company Friend MTS Ltd. donated its video fingerprinting technology (known as F1) to ICMEC to help increase the efficiency of child pornography investigations, and to halt the continued sharing of similar files over the internet. ICMEC distributes the technology to law enforcement agencies, software providers, and online service providers to hinder the spread of such material.\\"Fingerprints Used to Track Abuse Images\\" , Sky News, May 5, 2014 Simultaneously, Project VIC, along with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, is in the process of compiling a cloud-based archive to consolidate and store the immense amount of data related to these cases, and identify new material as soon as it is shared or transferred. Global Health Coalition In 2012, ICMEC created the Global Health Coalition, composed of health sector experts and leaders, to address child sexual abuse and exploitation as a global \\"public health crisis\\". ICMEC cited studies by the Mayo Clinic and others concluding that a history of abuse and exploitation as children leads to a number of health disorders in adulthood. ICMEC seeks to encourage the health sector to incorporate child sexual abuse into medical school curricula, increase timely victim recognition through medical training and education, and conduct epidemiological studies to improve healthcare services for victims. Coalition members include Roche, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, Harvard Medical School, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Caroline Copley (October 11, 2012). \\"Drug makers tackle health crisis of child sex abuse,\\" Chicago Tribune Digital Economy Task Force In 2013, ICMEC and Thomson Reuters Corporation hosted a conference of experts and leaders to examine the benefits and risks of the developing digital economy. The conference members included representatives from government, academia, civil society, and online services/web companies.\\"Family Time: Protect kids from online dangers\\", Taft Midway Driller, September 23, 2014 The conference led to the August 2013 launch of the Digital Economy Task Force. The Task Force assesses the benefits and the risks of an economy that has the potential to be 100% anonymous.\\"The Digital Economy: Potential, Perils, and Promises\\" , A Report of the Digital Economy Task Force, Thomson Reuters, March 2014 In March 2014, the Digital Economy Task Force released its first report, \\"The Digital Economy: Potential, Perils, and Promises,\\" consisting of a number of recommendations for policy makers, financial institutions, and law enforcement. The report recognizes the opportunities that a digital economy offers, but also highlights the potential for its abuse and misuse, including its role in facilitating criminal activities, including the sexual exploitation of children. Recommendations included the continuation of private and public sector research on the issue, investment in law enforcement training on how the digital economy operates, and the promotion of a global cross-sector discussion that can lead to clear policy on the issue. Regional activities ICMEC has regional presence in Brazil and in Singapore. The Centre encourages the creation of national operational centers built on a public-private partnership model. The ICMEC Latin America & Caribbean office works to help individual country legislators, government agencies, and regional bodies draft uniform legislation and train officers on how to respond to cases of child trafficking, child pornography, abduction, and online grooming.\\"ICMEC Regional Offices and Representation\\" , ICMEC\\"The Child Defender; Katia de Mello Dantas\\", The Rotarian, February 2012, p. 49 The ICMEC Asia Pacific Office fosters partnerships to fight child sexual exploitation and abuse. Its primary focus has been to fight online child sexual abuse and exploitation, by expanding the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography. In addition, ICMEC has helped establish a number of national and regional centers, including Child Focus in Belgium, The Smile of the Child in Greece, the Romanian Center for Missing & Sexually Exploited Children (FOCUS), the South African Centre for Missing & Exploited Children, and the Southeastern European Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which serves as a hub for 13 countries in the Balkan region.

The administrative headquarters of Choiseul Province is situated in the town of Taro. History In 1768, the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville named the island after the then French foreign minister, √âtienne Fran√ßois, duc de Choiseul. The first recorded sighting by Europeans was by the Spanish expedition of √Ålvaro de Menda√±a in April 1568. More precisely the sighting was due to a local voyage done by a small boat, in the accounts the brigantine Santiago, commanded by Maestre de Campo Pedro Ortega Valencia and having Hern√°n Gallego as pilot. They charted it as San Marcos, and also named the narrow channel separating San Jorge from Santa Isabel Island as the Ortega channel after the commander of the expedition.Sharp, Andrew The discovery of the Pacific Islands Oxford, 1960, p.45.Brand, Donald D. The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations The American Geographical Society, New York, 1967, p.133. In the nineteenth century Choiseul islanders suffered attacks from blackbirding (the often brutal recruitment or kidnapping of labourers for the sugar plantations in Queensland and Fiji). In April 1885, the German Empire declared a Protectorate over the North Solomon Islands, including Choiseul. In 1900, under the terms of Treaty of Berlin (14 November 1899), Germany transferred the North Solomon Islands (except for Bougainville and its surrounding islands) to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in exchange for the British giving up all claims to Samoa. Missionaries settled on Choiseul under both protectorates, converting most of the population to Christianity. In the early 20th century several British and Australian firms began large-scale coconut planting. The Austrian anthropologist and photographer Hugo Bernatzik visited Choiseul in 1932. Bernatzik documented some of the few remaining ancestral customs of the island people and described them in an ethnography that he published a few years later. He also took some photographs of the islanders and brought back a stone urn with carvings, reflecting a culture that he deemed was dying in contact with the modern world.Hugo Bernatzik, Owa Raha. B√ºchergilde Gutenberg, Vienna / Z√ºrich / Prague, 1936 During World War II Japanese forces occupied Choiseul in 1942. A battalion of US Marines carried out a raid on the island in October ‚Äì November 1943, to divert attention away from the Landings at Cape Torokina.Shaw, Henry & Kane, Douglas, Isolation of Rabaul, 1963, p. 194. Following the independence of the Solomon Islands in July 1978, Choiseul has been administered as part of Choiseul Province. Environment= Mount Maetambe ‚Äì Kolombangara River Important Bird Area This 78,398 ha site in central Choiseul has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of threatened or endemic bird species. It covers a tract of intact forest extending from the south-western coast of the island, between the Vurulato and Sepa rivers, reaching an altitude of 800 m. This is the best example of karst limestone forest in the Solomons. The eroding limestone has formed a landscape of caves and subterranean rivers. Mount Maetambae is an extinct volcano. A potential threat to the biodiversity of the site is logging. Bird species for which the site was identified as an IBA include Melanesian scrubfowl, crested cuckoo-doves, red-knobbed imperial pigeons, Solomons boobooks, imitator goshawks, Sanford's sea eagles, ultramarine kingfishers, Solomons cockatoos, song parrots, Finsch's pygmy parrots, black- faced pittas, red-capped myzomelas, Solomons cuckooshrikes, white-winged fantails, steel-blue flycatchers, Solomons pied monarchs, chestnut-bellied monarchs, white-billed crows, yellow-throated white-eyes and midget flowerpeckers.

AppleSearch was a client/server application, although the vast majority of the logic was located in the server. The server portion periodically crawled a set of administrator- configured locations on hard drives, CD-ROMs and the network using AppleShare, indexing the documents it found after converting them to plain text using the Claris XTND document conversion system. A later version of the server, 1.5, could also be pointed at selected WAIS servers, using their indexes directly in addition to local ones. The same server also acted as a WAIS server, respond to WAIS requests sent to it over the internet. The server also offered a set of AppleEvents for use from Mac programs. The server's query parser incorporated a number of features to help improve the ease-of-use of the query language. For instance, AppleSearch did not require the user to type in Boolean operators like AND or OR in their searches. While this is true for most search engines today, at the time this was a fairly uncommon feature. AppleSearch also supported stemming, which expanded search terms into similar words. Using stemming, a search on \\"pregnancy\\", for instance, would also find hits on \\"pregnant\\". Contractions, connecting words and punctuation were all handled as well. Additionally, the search could be fed with the results of previous search in order to tune its results. For instance, if one searches on \\"turkey recipe\\", the first set of results might return a document on how to cook a turkey, but also one on middle-eastern cooking in Turkey. If the user then selected the document on cooking a turkey, they could then ask for more documents like that one. The engine would find key words in the document and use those as additional terms in the new search. This feature has since appeared in Google, under the Similar pages link. AppleSearch also included the ability to summarize documents into a shorter form. It did this by selecting sentences from the document that contained a higher than normal number of key words, the key words being the same set that would be used for search tuning, as above. The user could request a version of the document some percentage of the original size, and the engine would then remove sentences it considered less important (those with less of the key words) until it reached the requested size. The client portion was essentially a communications module that sent text-based requests to the server and received responses back. The client portion could be used within programs to integrate search capabilities with relative ease, the API was fairly small. Such applications were not common, instead, the client API was more commonly used as a gateway for internet software, including plug-ins for Gopher and web servers, notably MacHTTP and (later) WebSTAR.AppleSearch.acgi AppleSearch was also bundled with the Apple Internet Server Solution, a hardware/software bundle offered to create out of the box web servers based on the Apple Workgroup Servers. AppleSearch was fairly resource heavy when it was released. It required a Mac using a 68040 and 5 MB of RAM as a minimum, which in 1994 was limited to Apple's higher-end offerings. Version 1.0.1, released in May 1994, added support for PowerPC-based machines as well. A basic install with the server and a five-user license cost $1,799, although this was reduced to $1,399 when version 1.5 was released. An additional ten users cost $499. AppleSearch originated in the Advanced Technology Group (ATG), Apple's internal R&D; labs. Prior to the release of AppleSearch, ATG had long been giving demos of the system using a client application known as Rosebud, The Virtual Community:Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier which used the AppleSearch server to build a personalized newspaper. The stories were collected into a multi-column display that looked like a real newspaper, along with a personalized banner across the top. Each story had a small icon of the reporter that selected that story, and when the icon was double-clicked, a panel opened that allowed you to fine-tune the search parameters, or alternately simply say \\"more like this\\" or \\"less like this\\". Users would normally have several reporters, one for sports and another for science for instance. Sadly when AppleSearch was eventually released, Rosebud did not ship with it. The utility of a newspaper engine given only local text files to search from is likely limited, but with the coming of the web the product would have had some utility.

In addition to AgustaWestland's manufacturing facilities in Italy and the United States, the AW139 is produced in Russia by HeliVert, a joint venture between AgustaWestland and Russian Helicopters. The AW139 was originally designed and developed jointly by Agusta and Bell Helicopters and marketed as the Agusta-Bell AB139, being redesignated AW139 when Bell withdrew from the project. Since entering service in 2003, the AW139 has become one of AgustaWestland's most influential products; it has been subsequently developed into the enlarged medium-lift military-orientated AW149. Development=Origins A corporate transport AW139 In 1997, the Italian helicopter manufacturer Agusta launched a programme to develop a replacement for the Bell Huey family of helicopters (which had been built in very large numbers by Bell Helicopter and under license by Agusta). A potential market of 900 aircraft was predicted. In 1998, Bell and Agusta entered into an agreement setting up a joint venture, Bell/Agusta Aerospace Company (BAAC), to develop two aircraft: a conventional helicopter and a tiltrotor aircraft. These became the Bell/Agusta AB139 and Bell/Agusta BA609 respectively.Niccoli 2001, p. 158. Bell was to be the leading partner for the development of the BA609 while Agusta would be the lead partner for the AB139; it was intended for production, sales, and support to be shared.Bower, Ron. \\"The AB139: Filling The Market Gap.\\" Rotor&Wing;, 1 May 2005.

It was promoted at the US market, including for the U.S. Air Force's Common Vertical Lift Support Program. The AW139M is equipped with a high definition forward-looking infrared (FLIR), self- protection system, heavy-duty landing gear, and has low thermal and acoustic signatures; a significant proportion of the equipment is sourced from American manufacturers. Options offered include an external stores system including various armaments, armoured seats, self-sealing fuel tanks, and a full ice protection system for all-weather operations.\\"AgustaWestland Debuts the AW139M Helicopter.\\" AgustaWestland, 17 February 2011. The AW139 serves as the basis for AgustaWestland's wider business strategy, under which it aims to produce a standardised family of helicopters with common design features. The sharing of components and design philosophies is intended to simplify maintenance and training for operators; commonality also lowers the production costs. The AW139 was the first of this group, and as of 2014, it was to be joined by the larger AW149 and AW189, aimed at military and civilian customers respectively.

In 2015, AgustaWestland unveiled an AW139 variant with an increased gross weight of 7 tonnes, enabling a range of 305 km while carrying 12 passengers; existing AW139s can also be rebuilt to the newer heavy-weight model. The heavier airframe comes at the expense of decreased hot and high performance.Turnbull, Grant. \\"AgustaWestland unveils heavier AW139\\". Rotorhub, Shephard Media. 3 March 2015. Retrieved 9 March 2015. In November 2015, AgustaWestland demonstrated a 60-minute \\"run-dry\\" test (no oil) of an AW139's main gearbox, 30 minutes greater than any other certified rotorcraft at the time. Design Instrument panel of the AW139 The AW139 is a conventional twin-engine multi-role helicopter. It has a five-bladed fully articulated main rotor with a titanium hub and composite blades and a four-bladed articulated tail rotor. It is fitted with retractable tricycle landing gear, the two aft wheels retracting into external sponsons which are also used to house emergency equipment. It is flown by a crew of two pilots, with up to 15 passengers accommodated in three rows of five. The AW139 had been aimed at a vacant niche in the market, sitting below larger types such as the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma and Sikorsky S-92, and above smaller ones like the Bell 412 and Eurocopter EC155. Rotor & Wing has described the AW139's flying attitude as 'docile and predictable'. The AW139 is powered by two FADEC-controlled Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6C turboshaft engines; the FADEC system seamlessly adjusts the engines for pilot convenience and passenger comfort, and can automatically handle a single-engine failure without noticeable deviation.Niccoli 2001, pp. 158‚Äì159, 162. It was constructed with maintenance requirements in mind; critical systems can be readily accessed, where possible the number of parts has been reduced, and many components have been designed for an extended lifecycle; a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) is also equipped.\\"Swedish Maritime Administration Orders Seven AW139 Helicopters for Search and Rescue.\\" Shipping & Marine, 4 February 2013. More than a thousand customizable items of equipment can be configured per customer demand, including auxiliary fuel tanks, rescue hoists, cargo hooks, search and weather radar, ice protection systems, external cameras and searchlights, and seating arrangements. The AW139 features a modular glass cockpit, a commonly-installed feature being the four-axis autopilot, which enables functions such as auto- hover capability. The cockpit has been designed to enable single-pilot flight operations under instrument flight rules conditions, and it is also compatible with the use of night vision goggles. Pilot training for the type is available via advanced Level D Full Flight Simulators. According to Shipping & Marine, the AW139 has \\"the largest cabin in its class\\"; containing up to 15 passengers or four litters and accompanying medics, an additional baggage compartment is used to stow equipment to keep the main cabin clear for use. Large sections of the AW139 have been developed and produced by a range of different companies. Airframes are typically produced by PZL-≈öwidnik, who delivered their 200th airframe in April 2014. Pratt & Whitney Canada produce the type's PT6C turboshaft engines, while the primary and secondary transmissions were developed by Westland GKN and Kawasaki Heavy Industries respectively. A significant portion of the avionics are sourced from Honeywell.\\"AW139, setting the standard in its category.\\" helicomag.com, 14 June 2012.

Gauss sums are the analogues for finite fields of the Gamma function. Such sums are ubiquitous in number theory. They occur, for example, in the functional equations of Dirichlet -functions, where for a Dirichlet character the equation relating and ) (where is the complex conjugate of ) involves a factor :\\\\frac{ G(\\\\chi) }{ G(\\\\chi) }.  History  The case originally considered by Carl Friedrich Gauss was the quadratic Gauss sum, for the field of residues modulo a prime number , and the Legendre symbol. In this case Gauss proved that or for congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4 respectively (the quadratic Gauss sum can also be evaluated by Fourier analysis as well as by contour integration). An alternate form for this Gauss sum is: :\\\\sum e^{\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi i r^2}{p}} Quadratic Gauss sums are closely connected with the theory of theta functions. The general theory of Gauss sums was developed in the early 19th century, with the use of Jacobi sums and their prime decomposition in cyclotomic fields. Gauss sums over a residue ring of integers are linear combinations of closely related sums called Gaussian periods. The absolute value of Gauss sums is usually found as an application of Plancherel's theorem on finite groups. In the case where is a field of elements and is nontrivial, the absolute value is . The determination of the exact value of general Gauss sums, following the result of Gauss on the quadratic case, is a long-standing issue. For some cases see Kummer sum. Properties of Gauss sums of Dirichlet characters The Gauss sum of a Dirichlet character modulo is :G(\\\\chi)=\\\\sum_{a=1}^N\\\\chi(a)e^\\\\frac{2\\\\pi ia}{N}.

The school is the major provider of secondary education in the area and is headmastered by Mr Danie Malan, that took the lead from former headmaster Mr Christiaan Klopper. With the post-war growth of the Hottentots Holland district, in 1962 a second High School (Afrikaans medium) was opened, which mainly served the Strand. Ho√´rskool Strand has four quarters in a school year, from January to December. The school provides classes from grade eight to grade twelve (the latter also known as matric). Sport Ho√´rskool Strand competes in inter-schools activities with neighbouring schools Parel Vallei High School and Hottentots Holland High School. They also compete against tour groups, such as the Bablake School from England, which last toured Strand in mid-2010. The sports in which it competes include rugby, cricket, hockey, netball, squash, tennis and chess. Sports activities which are not limited to inter-school competition include swimming and surfing. The school also has a strong academical focus, but it is considered by most to be concentrating on excelling in the sports-world. A school rule requiring students to take part in at least one winter- and one summer activity, introduced at the beginning of 2006, is evidence of the school's goal to become a sport power within the school circles in the area. They succeeded in winning the winter-interschools again in 2006 by beating Hottentots Holland in the main rugby match of the day. On 14 October 2006, the school sent a year 11 student, Corn√© Blaauw, to compete in the World Junior Chess Championship which was held in Georgia. Academic Academically the school also excels on national front. The school provides a wide variety of subjects to its students, however the students are required to take the default list of subjects in grade 8 and 9, with the option to take English as a first language. Grade 9 students have the opportunity to choose between Arts and Culture as subject, or the alternative of Music, Dramatic Arts or Art. Here is a list of the subjects: *Language, Literacy and Communication **Afrikaans First Language **English First Language **English Second Language *Mathematical Literacy, Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences **Mathematics; or **Mathematical Literacy **Additional mathematics *General Sciences **Physical Sciences **Biology *Human and Social Sciences **History **Geography *Economics **Accounting **Business Economics **Information Technology (Done at Hottentots Holland High, as appointed by the WCED) **Computer Literacy **Computer Sciences *Technology **Engineering Graphics and Design **Home Economics **Technology *Life Orientation **Life Skills and Psychology **Arts and Cultures **Visual art **Cultural Studies *Art History *Music **Practical and theory *Dramatic Arts *Other **German Second Additional Language **Tourism Some of the subjects require minimum entry qualifications. Exchange system The school is very active in exchanging students with the Burgerschool in Roeselare in Flanders, (Belgium), due to the language similarities between Afrikaans and Dutch which makes communication much easier. Students can also visit schools in Germany, Switzerland and Argentina. Exchange students visiting the school come from Belgium, England, Germany and Italy. England and Italy however mainly provide sport tour groups. The exchange students from Germany go there through FSA Youth Exchange. The current 2012/2013 Strand High Exchange students sent to the Burgerschool, is the first exchange group to visit four different locations, viz. England, Belgium, the Netherlands and France. Societies Strand High is proud to have several societies that is interactive with the community, all of which are operated by the students, and supervised by educators who have been assigned to the society.  FUEL  Faithful Until Eternal Life, abbreviated FUEL, is a Christian youth organisation at the school.  Ti Amo  Ti Amo (Love ,It.), is a student-run organisation, which started in 2005 as a division of the Council of Student Affairs. It later parted from the Student Council and became an organisation on its own. The organisation chooses five non-profit community organisations to serve every year.  Suidooster  Named after the wind-direction that makes the Strand famous, the Suidooster newspaper is the official school newspaper, with an all-student editorial board, and two educators as head editors.
