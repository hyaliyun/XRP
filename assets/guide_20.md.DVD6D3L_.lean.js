The rest was rebuilt by the monks of Notley Abbey starting in 1493. It is built on a cruciform plan with aisles, north porch, chapel to north side of the chancel and an octagonal staircase on the outside of the north side which gives access to a vestry and above it a private chapel. The south porch door was formerly in Hillesden House. It retains the bullet holes from the English Civil War when the village was attacked by Parliamentary Forces. It was restored between 1874 and 1875 by George Gilbert Scott. He had been born in the nearby village of Gawcott and this building was one of the inspirations for his interest in Gothic architecture. He restored it for free. It was reopened on 16 June 1875. The roofs were replaced and a ceiling inserted with oak panels and mouldings. The old seats were restored and new ones made to match. The pulpit was remodelled. The screen was restored and installed to separate the chantry from the transepts. The Denton tomb in the chancel was repaired. The stained glass windows were relaid by Burlison and Grylls and a new window inserted which depicts the story of the parables. It was restored again in the 1960s.

Malacca's Memorial  Malacca's efforts took the form of a Victoria Memorial Fountain which was completed by the end of February 1905. Built by Messrs. Doulton and Sons on the banks of the River Thames, Malacca's Queen Victorial Memorial Fountain was constructed of glazed gresyish-green earthenware with blue tints and was situated on the clocktower green. It had been shipped over in numbered bricks for reassembly locally.\\"Malacca Notes.\\" The Straits Times [Singapore] 28 February 1905: 5.

Penang's Memorial   Conception  At Penang a public meeting was held towards the end of January 1902, to decide the question of having a local Queen Victoria Memorial. Chaired by Penang's Resident Councillor who opened the meeting by saying it was open to Penang to subscribe to Singapore's memorial but a resolution was being laid before those assembled to admit of Penang having a memorial of its own. Dr. Brown moved \\"That it is desirable to commemorate the memory of Her Late Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria in Penang.\\" He said that it was meet that the late Queen's subjects at Penang should do something to signify their reverence and devotion to the memory of the Late queen and that they should give some permanent token of their appreciation of the benefits that had accrued to the Settlement of Penang from her reign. The resolution was seconded by Mr. Bryant. Mr. Ross moved \\"That the form such memorial shall take is that of a Public Park to be known hereafter by the name of Victoria Park,\\" and this was carried unanimously. R. Yeats submitted \\"That a suitable site for the said park be selected by the Committee hereafter appointed as near to the centre of the town as possible, and that public subscriptions be immediately invited for the purpose of purchasing such site and putting the same into proper order and conditions as a Public Park. The funds subscribed to be applied by the said Committee at their discretion for the purposes set forth in the resolutions and for the disbursement of any reasonable expenses incurred in the conduct of the undertaking.\\" This was seconded by Cheah Tek Thye and was carried. A. R. Adams pointed out that the task of the committee was difficult. The purchase of land and laying it out would involve a large amount of money. The site suggested covered eight to ten acres of land between Burmah Road and Macalister Road, to the east of Madras Lane and the cost of land was estimated to be no less than $50,000, quite apart from the cost of filling it and levelling it, and making open spaces for public recreation. Adams noted that unless the Chinese, who had all the money, could be induced to come forward in a substantial manner, the project could not be undertaken. Unlike the case of Singapore, it was noted that Penang could not expect any assistance from Government or the Municipality.\\"Victoria Memorial At Penang. To take the form of a Park.\\" The Straits Times [Singapore] 30 January 1902: 5. Print. The Chinese community of Penang held a meeting on 10 March 1902 to discuss the proposal for a Victorial Memorial Green. The assembly resolved that Koh Cheng Sian despatch a congratulatory message to King Edward VIII and Queen Alexandra on their coronation; that all Chinese shops and houses be lit with lanterns and decorated with flags and \\"Chhye\\" on 25 and 26 June, which were to be observed as holidays; that a Victoria Memorial Fund be raised among the Chinese kongsis, societies and community, and that such fund might then be used to acquire suitable land for the Victorial Memorial Green, or some other laudable object to be agreed on; and that a life-size painting of \\"Queen Victoria in Her Majesty's advanced age should be ordered from England and suspended in the most conspicuous part of the [Penang] Chinese Town Hall.\\"The Straits Times [Singapore] 15 March 1902: 4. Print.  Dissension  At this point, it appears, the Chinese community went their own way with the project. To understand why this happened, one must consider how they must have felt owing to the lack of support given by their Municipality and by Government, when contrasted with the Singapore situation, and the disparity in contributions received from or pledged by the Chinese and the European communities which in the words of A. R. Adams, present during the earlier meeting, stood at $10,000 from the Chinese for each $10 from Europeans. This appears to have created a schism and when the Chinese community later applied for permission to erect a pavilion at the Esplanade for their recreation, their application was rejected owing to a motion from Adams who objected to the application \\"to claim a portion of the Esplanade, after having decided to have a Victoria Memorial Park of their own there apart from the general community.\\" A. K. Buttery seconded and the rejection was carried.\\"Penang Chinese.\\" The Straits Times [Singapore] 7 April 1902: 2. Print.  Victoria Memorial Green and Statue  The Chinese Community did, eventually, purchase the land. Its principal donors were Cheah Choo Yew, Cheah Tek Thye, Khaw Joo Tok, Chung Thye Phin, Lim Kek Chuan, Lim Eow Hong, Lim Cheng Teik, Yeoh Ooi Gark, Cheah Choon Seng, Ho Tiang Wan and Tan Kung Hock. The land was purchased to be held in trust and preserved for future generations of the Chinese community at Penang. Today it is in the hands of the Victoria Green Trustees and CRC (Chinese Recreation Club) Trustees, made up of members of the Cheah, Khoo, Lim, Tan and Yeoh Kongsis. Later, a statue of Queen Victoria was cast and mounted on a pedestal on that land and engraved on a marble inset were the words, \\"The Statue of Her Majesty Queen Victoria was erected in 1930 to commemorate her long and glorius reign. The site and the adjacent recreation ground to which the name 'Victoria Green' was given were bought by the Chinese Community in 1903 and dedicated for the use of the Chinese community in Perpetuity.\\"Curtis, Penelope. Sculpture in 20th Century Britain. Leeds, England: Henry Moore Institute, 2003: 361 Print.  Unveiling of Statue by Governor Clementi  In 1930, Governor Sir Cecil Clementi was in Penang to unveil the Statue of Queen Victoria, at 10.30 a.m. on 23 April. This was his first visit to Penang since taking up the officer of Governor of the Straits Settlements.\\"Sir Cecil at Penang. Statue of Queen Victoria to be Unveiled.\\" The Straits Times[Singapore] 11 April 1930: 13. Print. Arriving early in the morning from Malacca aboard the Sea Belle II the Governor and Lady Clementi dropped anchor in a special berth near Victoria Pier and were greeted by Harbourmaster Lieutenant-Commander Owen. On landing at Victoria Jetty, they were received by the Hon. Mr. Gilman and Justice Sproule. After an inspection of the guard and a talk on the development of Penang's port, the Governor and Lady Clementi proceeded on to the Residency. After resting a while they went over to Victoria Green to unveil the statue of Queen Victoria. They were received by Lim Seng Hooi and the trustees of Victoria Green. Lim, in his welcome address, informed the Governor that the ground had been bought and the statue commissioned and erected by the Chinese of Penang in sincere gratitude for Queen Victoria's regard for the Chinese community there during her reign. This had been done to perpetuate her memory and to commemorate their high esteem for her.\\"Governor arrives at Penang.

An entry in the Singapore Free Press described how the citizens of the Permier Settlement pulled down a large building to make room for the statue.  New Building on Victoria Green  In June 1930, Chinese Recreation Club President Lim Lean Teng laid the foundation stone of a new building at Victoria Green.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 11 June 1930, Page 3  Illuminating the Victoria Memorial Statue  The statue was situated at the part of Victoria Green nearest to the junction of Burmah Road and Pangkor Road and to make it easy for the public who wished to examine the statue more closely without encroaching upon private property, the ground immediately surrounding the statue was declared public. The trustees of Victoria Green, through Municipal Commissioner Yeoh Cheang Aun, asked the Municipality to consider having the statue lit and night. Yeoh at a meeting of the Municipal Commission moved a resolution for free lighting to be provided, explaining the request of the trustees, pointing out that the statue had been intentionally located so close to the road to better serve public interests. Three members spoke against this and the resolution was carried by only one vote. Free lighting was then provided but this opposition brought about a strong feeling among the Chinese community that their gift to the public had been slighted. And while there may not have been any intention by the Municipal Commissioners to slight that gift, the impression among the public was that the municipal authorities were guilty of tactlessness and had missed an opportunity of fittingly replying to the act of courtesy by the Chinese of Penang.The Straits Times [Singapore] 9 October 1930: 6. Print.  Defying Japanese Vandalism  During World War II, the Japanese wanted to have the statue dismantled, dismounted, and carted away. They had done exactly that with the statue of Captain Francis Light, the founder of Penang (Wilcoxson had been commissioned to produce this six years after the Queen Victoria Memorial Statue was unveiled), and wished to remove this other reminder of British imperialism. Citizens loyal to the empire and the memory of their late monarch, had the memorial boarded up and prevented its removal. When Penang was finally liberated from Japanese Occupation, the boards were removed and the statue stood revealed, unscathed.The Straits Times [Singapore] 22 April 1953: 10. Print.Curtis, Penelope.

Description  The portrait is 41 centimetres high and therefore a little over life size. It is made of green slate rather than the usual marble, but the execution is nevertheless outstandingly good. Signs of old age, like the receding hairline, lines on the forehead and nose, lightly wrinkled cheeks, deep nasolabial folds and crow's feet around the eyes. Lines on the neck result from the incline of the head to the right hand side. The face is long, narrow and angular with marked cheekbones, a high forehead and a strong chin. The long, straight nose, the slight Adam's apple and the narrow-lipped mouth contribute to a lean, even emaciated appearance. The short, curled hair is combed forward from the back, but is merely engraved on the sculpture, not depicted in three dimensions. This increases the sparse appearance of the hair and head. The bust is largely intact, but there are small modern restorations to the seam of the tunic and toga on the right hand side. A gap in the right ear was also repaired at first, but is now once more in a fragmentary condition. The marble inlays in the eyes are modern, as is the podium.  Style  There is widespread agreement that the individual depicted by the bust is the Roman politician Gaius Julius Caesar, who was one of the most significant figures in the end of the Roman Republic in the first century BC. The only known portraits of him that derive from his lifetime are those on his coins, which are barely idealised and depict him with clearly unique features. They stand entirely in the Republican tradition. All known sculptural portraits were created only after his death. The Green Caesar belongs to a group of late Republican portraits which appear very individualised to the modern viewer, but actually just reproduce various idealised features. These depictions represent values and qualities which were expected of the statesman, using typological forms and normalised formulae. Thus the signs of old age indicate authority (auctoritas), while the gaze and expression show dignity and strictness (gravitas and severitas) and the tilt of the head shows dynamism and vigour. The viewer sees a serious and dignified man who is fully aware of his position and the duties that go with it, but also of his entitlement to it. The ascetic, sober style imitates the sobriety and endurance of a successful general, even thought the clothing is that of a statesman rather than a general. The actual circumstances of the portrait's creation are unclear. Many archaeologists place it in the first century BC, but the majority prefer the first century AD, in the early Imperial period. It was probably made in Egypt, since the green slate it is made of derives from Upper Egypt. In addition, the engraving of the hair instead of carving it in the round derives from Late Egyptian art, as do the firm, heavy contours of the slate.  Provenance  Presumably the bust was erected in Rome in ancient times and discovered there in the early modern period. Subsequently it was taken to France and in 1767 it was acquired by Frederick II of Prussia from the collection of Jean de Jullienne in Paris. With other antiquities in the royal possession it was put on display in the Antikensammlung Berlin in the 1820s. There the portrait has been displayed since 2010 in the Altes Museum, immediately next to a portrait of Cleopatra.

It belongs to the Archdiocese of Uppsala. History and architecture Interior view towards the choir The currently visible church was built during the 14th century, but may have been preceded by an earlier building. During the 15th century, the church was expanded and rebuilt. The original wooden ceiling was replaced by the currently visible brick vaults. These were originally covered with frescos but these were replaced with another set of frescos, still visible, at the end of the same century. These frescos were made by the workshop or a follower of Albertus Pictor. Originally both the vaults and the walls were covered in frescos, but in 1747 the walls were painted white. During the 15th century the church porch was also added. The church has remained largely unaltered since. The windows were enlarged in 1815 and the gable of the church porch was decorated in 1870. The church is rectangular in form, with the addition of the sacristy projecting from the church to the north and the church porch to the south. Its interior layout is that of an aisleless church. The building material of the church is fieldstone, externally whitewashed. Among the church furnishings, the baptismal font made of sandstone is the oldest, from the 12th century and thus older than the present church. The altarpiece dates from the end of the 15th century and was made in Sweden, while the wooden triumphal cross dates from the first half of the 14th century. The large wooden tabernacle is also medieval, as is one of the chandeliers currently in the sacristy. The chandelier in the choir is a gift given to the church at the end of the 17th century by the nobleman Gustaf Svinhufvud. His burial coat of arms also hangs in the church. The pulpit dates from 1718 and was made by Carl Spaak. South east of the church on the cemetery is a copy of a sculpture by Carl Milles.

It was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 29, 2015 in North America, simultaneously with 2K Sports' NBA 2K16, and on October 1, 2015 worldwide. NBA Live 16 features Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder as its cover athlete, and is the 20th installment of the NBA Live series. The following year, EA did not release a new installment in the series, instead resuming it in 2017 with NBA Live 18. That said, they did release a mobile version of NBA Live 16 in-between, beating NBA 2K to the mobile market. Development This game has improved defense and offense play, passing play, shooting play, dribbling play, and more animations for NBA Live 16. The game has also introduced Freestyle Control and Movement with improved visuals. This game mode allows players to play basketball life on the court and off the court with more clothes and a new Game Face app for iOS devices with App Store and Android Devices with Google Play. Live Run, a 5v5 online multiplayer mode, returned for the first time since NBA Live 10, while the game also introduced a new cooperative mode, Summer Circuit. Both modes are set in outdoor and indoor venues across various real-life cities such as Venice Beach, Brooklyn and Seattle. EA Sports describes their new league vs. league tournaments stating, \\"Work as a team and score as many points as possible to earn a win. Each member in the tournament will get to play 3 quarters. Select an opponent to play and score as many points as possible while playing good defense.\\" Other game modes include Rising Star which is where you create a player and work your way up to stardom in the NBA, the way you can level up is by using Experience Points which is what you earn after playing NBA games and in Pro-Am games. Reception NBA Live 16 received generally mixed reviews, according to Metacritic. Critics highlighted the improvements in game modes and overall quality of picture, but the most common complaints were associated with lag. IGN gave the game 6.0, as they were completely dissatisfied with the gameplay of NBA Live 16, stating \\"flashy presentation and interesting new game modes can only go as far as the stiff and laggy gameplay will take it.\\" They also stated that the game has very clumsy controls that can only go so far within this game. Bleacher Report gave a rating of a 7.4, giving more positive statements than negative ones as they said, \\"at its best, NBA Live 16 flows incredibly well with smooth back-and- forth action at venues spanning the globe and most times details look great in the process\\". EGMNOW gave the game a 6.5, the game gave them mixed feelings as they state, \\"NBA Live 16 takes a small baby step forward with the franchise, but there are still core gameplay elements that need to be smoothed out before it can be a championship caliber game\\".

It is the 25th installment of the NHL series and was released on September 15, 2015 in North America and September 17 and 18 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The game was released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with a separate release for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 titled NHL: Legacy Edition. Jonathan Toews of the Chicago Blackhawks is the official cover athlete, marking his second appearance on an NHL cover, following NHL 11. Featuring game presentation in the style of the NBC Sports Network, NHL 16 runs on EA Sports' advanced Ignite game engine and features many game modes, including one that has the player take control of their own custom player and pursuing a career in the NHL and one that has the player play as the manager of any NHL team. The fan-favorite EA Sports Hockey League (EASHL) mode, an online co-operative play mode, also returns to the game after being left out of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of NHL 15, the game's predecessor. Upon release, NHL 16 received positive reviews and was declared an improvement over NHL 15 by critics. Gameplay NHL 16 contains several game modes; \\"Be a GM\\", where the player controls the general manager of a team of their choice, \\"Be a Pro\\", where the player controls their own custom player and progresses his career, Hockey Ultimate Team, where the player collects cards of real-life players, build a team, and then take on either players online or A.I. teams, and EA Sports Hockey League, abbreviated as EASHL, a multiplayer-only mode where players can use their own custom player to join other teams, also with custom players controlled by other people, and take on other teams. The EASHL returns after being dropped from the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of NHL 15. It features some changes in its progression system to address balance issues, including a switch to a class-based progression model similar to Be a Pro mode, and the removal of attributes and boosts. A beta for the EASHL mode was available for NHL 15 owners from July 30 to August 10. Other features included are offline and online shootout modes, online team play, which has the user take control of players from real-life teams, and online versus, a simple head-to-head match. Returning to the game is the NBC Sports Network- style presentation, which features the network's score bug as well as commentary provided by Mike \\"Doc\\" Emrick (play-by-play), Eddie Olczyk (color), and Ray Ferraro (ice-side reporter). Emrick and Olczyk's actual selves are present during the pregame intro cutscenes. Cover NHL 16 did not have a cover vote in contrast to the previous year's iteration. At the 2015 NHL Awards, it was revealed that Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews of the Chicago Blackhawks, who had won the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals, were selected to be on the cover of the game. It is Toews' second appearance on the cover of an NHL game, following NHL 11. It was supposed to be Kane's second appearance as well, following NHL 10, but on August 12 EA Sports announced that Kane would no longer be appearing on the cover of the game in light of the fact he was the subject of a police investigation over a sexual assault allegation. NHL: Legacy Edition NHL: Legacy Edition is an updated version of NHL 15 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. There are some minor changes, such as the menu music; however, the EA Sports logo is instead shown for the album arts, the NHL Moments Live from 2013‚Äì14 is replaced by some new ones that were made available as the 2015-16 NHL season progressed, and in the \\"Custom Team\\" game mode the team name selection is improved. Release NHL 16 launched in North America on September 15, 2015, in both a standard edition and a deluxe set, which includes bonus content for use with the Hockey Ultimate Team game mode. NHL: Legacy Edition launched in North America on the same day as NHL 16, but it was released in a standard edition only. In Canada, an exclusive PlayStation 4 bundle launched with the game simultaneously, packaging both a PS4 console and a copy of NHL 16. Reception Upon its release, NHL 16 received positive reviews from critics and received much more positive reviews compared to its predecessor, NHL 15, which received more mixed and average reviews from critics. On GameRankings, the PlayStation 4 version holds a 79.67% rating, based on 23 reviews, and the Xbox One version holds an 82.23% rating, based on 15 reviews. On Metacritic, the PlayStation 4 version holds a 78/100 rating, based on 28 reviews, and the Xbox One version holds an 80/100 rating, based on 18 reviews. Critics generally felt that NHL 16 was an improvement over NHL 15. They directed acclaim at the fun gameplay of the game's wide variety of game modes as well as the return of the EASHL mode. Some criticism was aimed mainly at some lack of depth in these game modes as well as the game's menus and interface. Mat Paget of GameSpot awarded the game an 8/10. He complimented the content of NHL 16s game modes as well as the inclusion of the On-Ice Trainer, which he believes would help brand new players and would work very well in the game's Be A Pro mode. He stated, however, that the game's menus can sometimes be confusing to get around. For Game Informer, Matt Bertz wrote that EA Sports are heading in the right direction with NHL 16, but he felt that they failed to bring any \\"game- breaking quality\\" in terms of gameplay. Bertz complimented the game's improved artificial intelligence system for opposing teams as well as the NHL on NBC game presentation. Anthony LaBella of Game Revolution found the inclusion of several game modes to be positive for the game, but felt that some of them were not thoroughly developed enough. LaBella also enjoyed the revamped EASHL mode as well as the game's presentation.

He was also a collector of rare books, including many incunabula, and a devotee of letterpress printing. Early life and education McCune was born in Bellefontaine, Ohio, to Christopher James McCune (1868‚Äì1955) and Laura Miller McCune. He graduated in 1920 from St. Rose High School in Lima, Ohio, and attended the University of Dayton from 1920‚Äì21. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1924 from Georgetown University and obtained his medical degree in 1928 from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He once wrote: \\"Georgetown has meant many things to me: I shall name only two: a durable interest in public speaking, and a devotion to the Latin language and literature. These still constitute my most absorbing avocation, not only supplying intellectual recreation, but also providing focus for book collecting, fine printing, and bookbinding.\\" He was married to Mary Adams, also a doctor, from October 14, 1932, until 1951. The couple had no children. Medical career McCune began his medical career as an intern at Willard Parker Hospital in New York City, where he worked for two months in 1928. He then went to the Harriet Lane Home at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1928‚Äì29. He was a resident physician in pediatrics and contagious diseases at Cincinnati General Hospital from 1929‚Äì30, and then a resident physician at Babies Hospital in New York from 1930‚Äì34. From 1933‚Äì42, he was chief of clinic at the Vanderbilt Clinic in New York and director of its chemical laboratory, and from 1942‚Äì51 he was an attending physician at Babies Hospital. McCune was a consultant in pediatrics at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut (1943), at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, New Jersey (1946‚Äì52), and at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut (1947‚Äì52). During the 1930s and '40s, in addition to practicing medicine, McCune worked as a professor. He was an associate in pediatrics at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons from 1931‚Äì37, and then an assistant professor (1937‚Äì42), associate professor (1942‚Äì44), professor (1944), and member of the faculty of medicine at Columbia (1945‚Äì51). In 1951, McCune began to work as a physician at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Vallejo, California. He was the chief of pediatrics and physician-in-chief there from 1953‚Äì1965. In 1965, he was appointed as the staff assistant to Dr. Cecil Cutting, executive director of the Permanente Medical Group in Oakland, California. McCune was also a consultant in pediatrics for the U.S. Navy hospital at Mare Island (1957‚Äì58) and for David Grant Hospital on Travis Air Force Base (1966‚Äì68). Internationally, McCune was involved in two medical missions: a 1946 Unitarian Service Committee/UNRRA mission to Poland, and a 1948 Unitarian Service Committee mission to Colombia. McCune-Albright syndrome McCune‚ÄìAlbright syndrome, a rare genetic endocrine disease affecting the bones and pigmentation of the skin, was described independently by both McCune and Dr. Fuller Albright in 1937. McCune wrote more than thirty articles for medical publications and contributed to the Childcraft encyclopedia (1946 and 1954) and Encyclopedia Americana (1955). In addition, he coauthored M.B. Howorth‚Äôs Textbook of Orthopedics (1952). Book collecting and hobbies In 1961, the Vallejo City Council appointed McCune to the Vallejo Public Library Board, and in 1966, he was reappointed to another five-year term. He was a leader in the fund-raising efforts for a new library in Vallejo. The groundbreaking for the library, named after John F. Kennedy, took place on September 4, 1968, and McCune commemorated the occasion with a broadsheet that he printed using his own hand press. That same year, he joined the California Library Association. McCune's book collection reflected a wide range of interests: Latin and Greek literature; printing in all its aspects (ink, paper, movable type, and binding); fine printers (e.g., Grabhorn Press, Plantin Press, Nonesuch Press, Henry Evans, John Henry Nash, and Valenti Angelo); Californiana; and limited- edition publications of the Book Club of California. His collection also included magazines on the printing arts (e.g., The Fleuron, The Bookbinder, The Book-Collector's Quarterly, The Colophon, Imprint, and The Monotype Recorder) and ephemera from fine printing presses. Bookbinding McCune took up bookbinding in 1960 as a way to save money. By June 1963, he had bound more than 200 volumes and about 100 cases to contain the valuable items in his collection. He rebound many of his favorite books in leather. In addition, McCune often requested unbound copies of books, pamphlets, and other materials from printers so that he could do the binding himself. He stamped the spines of his rebound books with his personal mark: a gold beagle with the inscription \\"Beagle Press\\", in honor of his pet beagle, You-You. Printing McCune started his own hand-printing enterprise early in 1968. As a gift upon his retirement from Kaiser Permanente, he chose an Adana Horizontal Quarto Printing Press. He described his early foray into hand- printing: \\"Early in this new career ‚Äî now three months old ‚Äî I printed an apprentice-piece, Ad Dante, embodying the only Latin verses I have ever had the nerve to write ‚Äî and that nearly fifty years ago. The presswork was atrocious.\\" He then took lessons from Roger Levenson at the Tamalpais Press. In July 1968, McCune obtained an iron and steel Albion press, manufactured in London in 1852 by Hopkinson & Cope, the latter having invented it around 1820. The machine stood approximately six feet six inches in height and weighed just under 2,000 pounds. Because it was so large and McCune was only about five foot six, he had a platform built on which he could stand to operate the press. The plumed finial on top frequently sported a beret to add to the informality of McCune‚Äôs printing operation. McCune used his presses to print various hand-made publications and broadsheets. Although he enjoyed printing, he wrote in one letter that when he printed 100 copies of a single broadsheet (as he did for the Roxburghe Club), he found it exceedingly tedious. Clubs and societies While living in New York, McCune was a member of the Harvey Society, whose stated purpose was to establish a closer relationship between the practical side of medicine and the results of laboratory research. McCune joined the Vallejo Chamber of Commerce in 1957 and was the chairman of its Committee on Public Relations from 1959‚Äì60. In 1960, he became a member of the Board of Directors of the Solano County Legal Aid Society. In 1965, as a representative of the Legal Aid Society, he served on the Solano County Council of Economic Opportunity. Death and legacy McCune died on April 11, 1976, in Vallejo, California. He bequeathed all of his rare books, printing presses, and bookbinding tools to the City of Vallejo. His full collection of art and rare books is now housed in the \\"McCune Room\\" of the city's John F. Kennedy Library. In 1988, the Roxburghe Club of San Francisco and the Zamorano Club commemorated a re-awakening of the Beagle Press by hand-printing 250 copies of The Beagle Press Recidivus. The first 125 were given out as keepsakes for members of the Roxburghe and Zamorano Clubs who visited the McCune collection in the Vallejo library on October 1, 1988. The copies were designed and printed by Roxburghe Club members Al Newman, Gordon Williams, and Thomas Woodhouse on the McCune collection's Albion hand press.

In World War I, the area around Hooge on Bellewaerde Ridge, about east of Ypres in Flanders in Belgium, was one of the easternmost sectors of the Ypres Salient and was the site of much fighting between German and Allied forces. Within a radius of Hooge are the sites of Ch√¢teau Wood, Sanctuary Wood, Railway Wood and Menin Road. There are four Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) war cemeteries in this area and several museums and memorials. Hill 62 and Mount Sorrel (Also Mont Sorrel) are further south, while the sites known to British and Commonwealth soldiers as Stirling Castle and Clapham Junction are further east. Background Hooge For much of the war, Hooge was one of the easternmost sectors of the Ypres Salient, being almost constantly exposed to enemy attacks from three sides. After the First Battle of Ypres in 1914, the front line of the salient ran through the Hooge area and there was almost constant fighting in the region over the next three years, during which Hooge and the Ch√¢teau de Hooge, a local manor house were destroyed. Around the village, the opposing front lines were almost within whispering distance of each other. With its ruined village and a maze of battered and confusing trench lines, the area was regarded as a hazardous area for the infantry, where snipers abounded and trench raids were frequent. Both sides saw Hooge as a particularly important area and a key target for heavy artillery bombardment. Geography of the Ypres Salient Ypres is overlooked by Kemmel Hill in the south-west and from the east by low hills running south- west to north-east with Wytschaete (Wijtschate), Hill 60 to the east of Verbrandenmolen, Hooge, Polygon Wood and Passchendaele (Passendale). The high point of the ridge is at Wytschaete, from Ypres, while at Hollebeke the ridge is distant and recedes to at Polygon Wood. Wytschaete is about above the plain; on the Ypres‚ÄìMenin road at Hooge, the elevation is about and at Passchendaele. The rises are slight apart from the vicinity of Zonnebeke which has a gradient of From Hooge and to the east, the slope is near Hollebeke, it is heights are subtle and resemble a saucer lip around the city. The main ridge has spurs sloping east and one is particularly noticeable at Wytschaete, which runs south-east to Messines (Mesen) with a gentle slope to the east and a to the west. Further south is the muddy valley of the Douve river, Ploegsteert Wood (Plugstreet to the British) and Hill 63. West of Messines Ridge is the parallel Wulverghem (Spanbroekmolen) Spur and the Oosttaverne Spur, also parallel, lies further east. The general aspect south and east of Ypres is one of low ridges and dips, gradually flattening northwards beyond Passchendaele into a featureless plain. Possession of the higher ground to the south and east of Ypres gives ample scope for ground observation, enfilade fire and converging artillery bombardments. An occupier also has the advantage that artillery deployments and the movement of reinforcements, supplies and stores can be screened from view. The ridge had woods from Wytschaete to Zonnebeke giving good cover, some being of notable size like Polygon Wood and those later named Battle Wood, Shrewsbury Forest and Sanctuary Wood. In 1914, the woods usually had undergrowth but by 1917, artillery bombardments had reduced the woods to tree stumps, shattered tree trunks and barbed wire tangled on the ground and shell-holes; the fields in gaps between the woods were wide and devoid of cover. Roads in this area were usually unpaved, except for the main ones from Ypres, with occasional villages and houses. The lowland west of the ridge was a mixture of meadow and fields, with high hedgerows dotted with trees, cut by streams and ditches emptying into canals. The main road to Ypres from Poperinge to Vlamertinge is in a defile, easily observed from the ridge. Military operations 1914 =First Battle of Ypres= During the First Battle of Ypres (19 October ‚Äì 22 November 1914), the Franco-British captured the town of Ypres from the Germans, the Ch√¢teau de Hooge was used by the commanders of the 1st Division and 2nd Division for a joint divisional headquarters. When the ch√¢teau was shelled by German forces on 31 October 1914, the divisional commanders Major General S. H. Lomax and Major-General Charles Monro) were injured, as were several members of their staffs, and some British soldiers were killed and Lomax died of his wounds several months later. By the end of the battle in November 1914 the Germans had been driven back but the front line of the Ypres Salient ran around Hooge. 1915 =Military mining= From the spring of 1915, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers. On 21 February 1915, the Germans exploded the first mine beneath the trenches at Hooge. =Second Battle of Ypres= German flamethrowers during the First World War on the Western Front, 1917 The British were forced to retreat from Zonnebeke, Veldhoek and the St Julien arc from 5‚Äì6 May 1915, during the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April ‚Äì 25 May 1915) to a surveyed and prepared position closer to Ypres. From 24‚Äì25 May 1915, the Battle of Bellewaarde was fought in the area until the end of the German offensive. During the night of reserve troops dug a new trench from the Menin road to Zouave Wood. The Cavalry Corps reoccupied Hooge and the chateau and further north the line was pushed forward and consolidated. The front line was straight from Kemmel to Hooge Chateau then curved back to the north-west of Zouave Wood then north again to Railway Wood, Hooge being at the angle of a pronounced salient. =Raid on Hooge Chateau= On 2 June 1915, German artillery bombarded the Hooge area from leaving only two walls of the chateau standing, after which infantry attacked and captured the chateau and stables. A counter-attack on the night of 3/4 June recovered the stables but the Germans held onto the chateau. =Actions of Hooge= On 19 July, the Germans held Hooge Chateau and the British the stables and no man's land either side was . Inside the German salient was a fortification under which the 175th Tunnelling Company had dug a gallery long and charged a mine with of ammonal but waterlogged ground required the explosives to be loaded upwards. The mine was sprung at and left a crater wide and which was rushed by two companied of the 8th Brigade, 3rd Division. No artillery-fire had been opened before the attack and the Germans were surprised as bombers of the 8th Brigade advanced but then had to retire when they ran out of bombs. The trenches near the crater were consolidated and connected to the old front line, the 8th Brigade losing 75 casualties and taking 20 prisoners. On 22 July, the 3rd Division attacked east of the new line during the evening and the 14th (Light) Division attacked further north at Railway Wood but lacking surprise, both attacks failed. On 30 July the Germans attacked Hooge against the front of the 14th Division, which had held the line for a week. The area had been suspiciously quiet the night before and at 3:15 a.m. the site of the stables exploded and jets of fire covered the front trenches, the first German flame thrower attack against British troops. A simultaneous bombardment began, most of the 8th Rifle Brigade was overrun and the rest retreated to the support line. A second attempt to use the flame throwers was frustrated by rapid fire but attempts to counter-attack failed and most of the captured trenches were consolidated by the Germans. On 6 August, the 6th Division relieved the 14th Division and made a deliberate attack, with diversions on either flank by the 49th Division near Boesinghe, the 46th Division near Hill 60 and the 17th Division further right along with the 28th Division. From 3 August heavy artillery bombardments were fired at different times during the early hours. French artillery and 3 Squadron RFC participated and two brigades attacked after a hurricane bombardment. The brigades linked at the crater and dug in and German counter-attacks were broken up by the artillery which with direction by artillery-observation aircraft suppressed German artillery retaliation until mid-morning, when visibility reduced. Part of the captured ground on the right was evacuated under intense bombardment during the night. The 16th Brigade had 833 losses and the 18th Brigade 1,295 casualties, mostly from artillery fire after the attack. 1916 =Battle of Mont Sorrel= On 3 June 1916, the northern flank of the German attack at Mont Sorrel, Reserve Infantry Regiment 22 attacked towards Hooge but was repulsed. The Canadians were reinforced, defeated three night attacks before retiring before dawn to avoid being overrun. On 6 June the Germans sprung four mines under the front line at Hooge and captured the support trenches and remnants of the front trenches on the right. A counter-attack was considered but priority was given to the attacks due further south and the reserve line converted to be the new front line to avoid the costly occupation of such exposed ground. 1917 =Third Battle of Ypres= A raid by the 8th Division in II Corps, was made on Hooge on the night of 10/11 July. The raiders assembled so close to the barrage that several soldiers were wounded and then a machine-gun caused more casualties. The German resistance was so determined that only one prisoner was lifted and after 44 minutes the raiders retired, claiming killed for On 31 July, the first day of the Battle of Pilckem Ridge, the 8th Division advanced towards Westhoek and the 24th Brigade advanced through Hooge, over the Menin road and took its objectives relatively easily. The southern flank then became exposed to the concentrated fire of German machine-guns from Nonne Boschen and Glencorse Wood in the area to be taken by the 30th Division. 1918 =Battle of the Lys= The Germans retook Hooge in April 1918 as part of the Spring Offensive but were driven back from the area by the British on 28 SeptemberCommonwealth War Graves Commission, undated, accessed 16 February 2007 as the offensive faltered. Underground warfare 1915 After the Second Battle of Ypres and the Battle of Bellewaarde (24‚Äì25 May), local operations continued around Hooge. In the Ch√¢teau grounds a captured British strongpoint was subjected to a mining attack by the 175th Tunnelling Company. In June 1915, The tunnellers dug a gallery about long under the German position and placed a charge. As Hooge was on the apex of the Ypres Salient, it was considered a most dangerous job and the British command initially relied on volunteers. The 175th Tunnelling Company commander wrote, The work was completed in five and a half weeks. The first attempt at tunnelling started in a stable and failed because the soil was too sandy. A second shaft was sunk from the ruins of a gardener's cottage nearby. The main tunnel was in the end long, with a branch off this after about , this second tunnel running a further on. The intention was to blow two charges under the German concrete fortifications, although the smaller tunnel was found to be off course. The explosive‚Äîused for the first time by the British‚Äîwas ammonal supported by gunpowder and guncotton, making the Hooge mine the largest mine of the war thus far built. The main difficulties for the tunnellers were that the water table is very high, and that the clay expands as soon as it comes into contact with the air.http://www.webmatters.net/belgium/ww1_hooge.htm access date 24 April 2015 At 7:00 p.m. on 19 July 1915, the mine was fired. The explosion created a hole some deep and almost wide. The far side of the crater was then taken and secured by men from the 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders and 4th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. Ten of the latter were killed by debris from the mine as they waited in advanced positions.Hooge on ww1battlefields.co.uk, accessed 25 April 2015 The Germans tried to recover their lost position but were driven back by the British infantry and a heavy artillery bombardment. The mine fired by 175th Tunnelling Company at Hooge on 19 July 1915 was only the second British offensive underground attack in the Ypres Salient. On 17 April 1915, 173rd Tunnelling Company had blown five mines at Hill 60 using gunpowder and guncotton but none of these mines were even half as powerful as the Hooge charge. While the mine enabled the British infantry to take Hooge, the Germans soon took back all and more of the ground they had lost. By 30 July the German units had managed to take control of the ch√¢teau and the surrounding area.Battlefields 14-18, undated, accessed 16 February 2007 When 177th Tunnelling Company arrived at Hooge in November 1915, underground warfare in the area was far from over. One of the busiest areas for the miners on both sides was Railway Wood, an area at Hooge where the old Ypres‚ÄìRoeselare railway crossed the Ypres‚ÄìMenen road. Aerial photographs clearly show the proliferation of mine warfare in the Railway Wood sector during the unit's presence there, with craters lying almost exclusively in no man's land between the British and German trenches. With both sides trying to undermine their enemy, much of the unit's activity at Railway Wood consisted of creating and maintaining a shallow fighting system with camouflets, a deeper defensive system as well as offensive galleries from an underground shaft. 1916 On the morning of 28 April 1916, a German camouflet killed three men of 177th Tunnelling Company, including an officer (Lieutenant C.G. Boothby). The men were trapped underground and their bodies not recovered. After the war, they were commemorated nearby at the RE Grave, Railway Wood. On 6 June 1916, the Experimental Company of the Prussian Guard Pioneers succeeded in blowing four large mines under the British trenches at Hooge held by the 28th Canadian Battalion. After intense and sustained fighting, the Germans also retook the crater created by the British mine on 19 July 1915 as well as the British front line.With the British Army in Flanders: Hooge Crater, access date 26 April 2015. The German surprise offensive also captured the neighbouring Observatory Ridge and Sanctuary Wood‚Äîthe only high ground on British hands in the whole of the Ypres Salient. Canadian units later regained Observatory Ridge and Sanctuary Wood, but not Hooge. 1917 While engaged at Hooge until August 1917, the 177th Tunnelling Company also built a forward accommodation scheme in the Cambridge Road sector along the rear edge of Railway Wood, halfway in between Wieltje and Hooge. The Cambridge Road dugout system was located within of the front line. It was connected to the mining scheme beneath Railway Wood and eventually became one of the most complex underground shelter systems in the Ypres Salient. Its mined galleries were named after London streets for easy orientation. 177th Tunnelling Company was involved in constructing new dugouts beneath the Menin Road in the centre of Hooge, located in between 175th TC's July 1915 mine crater and the stables of the destroyed Ch√¢teau de Hooge. Parts of these dugouts now lie beneath the Hooge Crater CWGC Cemetery opposite the \\"Hooge Crater Museum\\". Further projects of the 177th Tunnelling Company in the area were the Birr Cross Roads dugout and dressing station beneath the Menin Road further west of Hooge, and the Canal Dugouts along the Ieperlee. Fighting in the Hooge sector continued until 1918, with the craters (tactically important in relatively flat countryside) frequently changing sides. Commemoration Hooge and Bellewaarde Among those killed in the fighting in Hooge was Gerard Anderson, the British hurdler who participated in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics and died in November 1914.ANDERSON, GERARD RUPERT LAURIE. Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Although the crater created in Hooge by the British mine on 19 July 1915 was filled in after the war as untenable and the repository of hundreds of bodies, several other large mine craters that were created over the course of the fighting can still be seen.WWI Battlefields, undated, accessed 16 February 2007 The most visible evidence remaining today is a large pond near the hotel and restaurant at the Bellewaerde theme park. The site is the result of work overseen by Baron de Wynck, who landscaped three mine craters (blown by German units in June 1916 as part of their offensive against Canadian troops) into the existing pond near the hotel (image).

He served as major in Reay‚Äôs Fencibles from 1794 to 1798, and was then on half-pay with the Yorkshire Fusiliers until 1802. He served as a volunteer during the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt, where he impressed senior officers including Sir John Moore.

He was severely wounded in the attack. In 1806 he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the 18th Foot. Later that year he returned to Orkney, where at the general election in December 1806 he was returned unopposed in his father's interest as MP for Orkney and Shetland. With his father's influence in Orkney facing a severe challenge, he served only one term, and did not contest the next election in June 1807. Like his uncle Robert, who preceded him as MP, he was away on active service for much of his time in office, and there is no record of him having voted or spoken in the House of Commons.

It is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List of Poland. Location The building is located at Dworcowa st.63, in downtown Bydgoszcz, on the embankment of to Brda river, approx. 300 meters from the main railway station. Until 1919, its address was Bahnhofstrasse 28, Bromberg. Building on a German map of 1914 History Bromberg railway station in 1890, soon after completion. Project inception The Directorate of Prussian Railways in Bromberg (now Bydgoszcz) was established in 1849 at Neuer Markt (now Nowy Rynek) 8, before moving in 1853 to the main train station building. As its activity expanded with the development of the Prussian Eastern Railway network, and despite the addition of large wings to the station in 1861, the edifice was almost entirely devoted to administrative purposes. The old station proved to be too narrow, and some departments had to be transferred to nearby rented houses (11 houses were rented in 1880). It soon became necessary to construct a new building. The architectural company for this project was chaired by Berlin architect Martin Gropius and economist Heino Schmieden. Philipp Martin Gropius, designer of the building, was a disciple of architects Schinkel and Beuth from Gewerbeinstitut Berlin. In 1855 he graduated from Bauakademie (Academy of Architecture) in Berlin, in 1862 he took the position of Landbaumeister (domestic architect) in the Berlin Police Construction agency. In 1869 he became director of the Royal School of Arts and Crafts in Berlin. The plan for a new building had been submitted in 1885 to the Prussian Assembly (Landtag). Initial costs were estimated at 2.5 million marks, considered too high by the Prussian Ministry of Public Works, and a more modest plant was developed, designed by Prussian National Building Inspector Bergmann Dahms. He chose a site at Bahnhofstrasse 28 (now ul. Dworcowa 63), near the main station. Construction Construction started in summer 1886 and ended middle of 1888. Dahms managed the project, except for the sewer and central heating installations. The interior employed rich architectural ornamentation emphasizing the importance of the station, a four- story building with two wings. Shortly after completion, a smaller edifice with outbuildings, including garages and a high-stack boiler room, was erected on a neighboring street. The scheme of the project (both facade displays and interiors) had to reflect the imposing appearance of official Prussian buildings of the era. In this case, it exhibited aspects of the Mannerist style. Follow-up The building remained the seat of the East Prussian Railways until Bromberg, renamed Bydgoszcz, became part of the refounded Polish state in August 1919. The new state administration created a Ministry of Railways in Warsaw, which appointed seven Directions of District State Railways, where Bydgoszcz was subordinated to the administration of DOKP in Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk), newly created as a \\"free city\\" under League of Nations supervision. Consequently, Bydgoszcz's building moved under the control of Department of Revenue, and in 1922 it housed an Office station. A year later, a medical Railway Clinic was set up there. After several changes of ownership, the Ministry of Communications moved a part of the Danzig headquarters back to the Dworcowa edifice (1 October 1933). At the same time, it housed the Central Bureau of Foreign logistics. (Polish: Centralne Biuro Rozrachunk√≥w Zagranicznych) of the PKP. In 1937, the building also housed the French-Polish Rail Association, a joint-stock company formed after the construction of railway line from Silesia to Gdynia. After the German occupation of World War II, building ownership moved to the National Treasury and passed back to Rail Administration in 1970. Since 1990 a large part of the premises is leased to numerous private and public companies. In October 2013 the building was handed to Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, in order to install their dentistry faculty. Necessary renovations to adapt the building to the needs of the institution and its equipment will cost about 30 million z≈Ç. Architecture Building main entrance The building is built in a reminiscing Dutch Mannerism, with a tower and decorative gables. In Bydgoszcz, such a style can be noticed similarly on a building at Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaja Street N¬∞9 (former shelter for blind people) and on the Lloyd's Palace building at Grodzka St.17. Dworcowa edifice has been built on a rectangular plan, with 3 courtyards in the middle of the building. Building body is covered with high gable roofs and 2 avant-corps front Towers topped with domes. The front elevation has highly detailed stone decoration, especially the main front gate facade. The main building material is brick, combined with cement-lime mortar and outside ornaments use red brick veneer. External walls have friezes enhanced with yellow and green clinker glazed brick. Other techniques include: * Bossage corners; * Cornices; * Portals; * Doorjambs made of carved sandstone. Building entrances are through side or main avant-corps of the elevation: each of them is adorned with ornate portal. The original window frames are still preserved with different forms, most decorative windows -passing through two floors- are dedicated to the main meeting room. All parts of the building are topped with gables and the two tall towers flanking the facade have tented roof with octagonal lanterns. Roofs, supported by a wooden structure, were originally covered with English tiles, now replaced by galvanized steel sheets. Several dormers pop out of the roof. In the vicinity, at Krolowej Jadwigi street, is located another edifice, replicating dutch Mannerism style of main building. In the renovation process, it lost its steep roofs and gables. After building completion in 1889, the following areas were in use: * In the basement - two apartments for ushers, branch prints and branch control; * On the ground floor - a safe home, the technical division, and the tariff policy office; * On the first floor - HR department, secretariat, a library, the traffic control; * On the second floor - planning office, technical, statistical and material offices. In the middle of the building, on the first floor, above the entrance hall was a representative conference room with 3 large windows. Today, building interior only partially reflects its original character. Best preserved are: * A three-span system hall; * Cross vaults corridors; * THe ceremonial staircase with windows filled with etched glass coats of arms motifs of cities (Gda≈Ñsk, Poznan). Representative conference room still retains large ornate panelling extending to a height of approx. 2 m, topped with ornate cornices. The hall leads to a massive portal (architecture) including motifs corbel and herma.

Until recently, an organized championship did not exist and only amateur tournaments were organised by few fans of the sport. The establishment of hockey federations is relatively recent as well as the organisation of Panhellenic championships. However, a form of this game was played by ancient Greeks. A marble relief of 510 B.C., on display at the Archaeological Museum of Athens, depicts athletes that play a sport like hockey. In addition, the 2nd-century BC writer Plutarch (or Pseudo-Plutarch) refers to a sport like hockey with the name Keretizein (ŒöŒµœÅŒ∑œÑŒØŒ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ). Field Hockey Hellinicon Olympic Hockey Center The first appearance of field hockey in Greece dates to the interwar period. It was introduced in the country by Panathinaikos A.O. in the early 20th century, but a national championship was organized much later. At the first post-World War II years the sport was played only in Anavryta Schools in Kifissia. Many years later, in 1994, the Greek Field Hockey Federation was founded and just after the Greek championship was held with the presence of six clubs. The first champion was the club AOH Hymettus from Anavryta Schools. The next years the hockey clubs increase. In 1998, the indoor hockey championship started. Because of the 2004 Athens Olympics a field hockey venue was created in Hellinikon Olympic Complex, the Hellinikon Olympic Hockey Centre. After the Olympics interest about the sport remained low, so in 2014 the Greek Field Hockey Federation was abolished, a move associated with a scandal related with the conducting of fake youth championships so that the athletes would gain bonus for the university entry exams. Ice Hockey Greek ice hockey clubs were found in North America since 1920. In Greece itself the sport began in 1984 by players that had come from abroad. At first, there were only five clubs, Iptamenoi Pagodromoi, Aris Thessaloniki, Avantes Chalkis, Tarandus Moschato and PAS Piraeus. In 1986 the Greek Federation of Ice Sports was founded. The federation regulates ice hockey as well as ice-skating and curling. Soon the first official championship was held in the Peace and Friendship Stadium, in 1989. The Peace and Friendship Stadium was the first big stadium with an ice rink in Greece. The Greek national team was formed in 1992. Despite the initial growth of the sport financial problems led to temporary stopping of ice hockey action. The championship stopped from 1994 to 1999 and the national team confronted great difficulties. Another championship was held in 2000 and the next was held in 2008. A continuing problem for the growth of the sport is the insufficiency of ice rinks. Today few permanent ice rinks operate in Athens and Thessaloniki.

The locality is about west of the town of Westbury. The 2016 census has a population of 203 for the state suburb of Chudleigh. It is a small rural village west of Launceston in northern Tasmania, Australia. The town is in the Chudleigh Valley, between the Gog range and the Great Western Tiers. The area is primarily used for farming, though timber and lime production have been significant industries. The fertile flats of the valley are of alluvial origin, from the Permian era. The Chudleigh show, run by the Agricultural and Horticultural society, is an agricultural show held each February. Since 1889 the show has been held 125 times, and it is one of the state's oldest such events. The area had been the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal Tasmanians for thousands of years. European settlement and disease drove them from the lands and decimated their population. Chudleigh was first settled by Europeans in the 1830s for agriculture and lime production. The town was laid out, probably prior to 1835, to have up to 5000 residents though the population never became large. An early resident, John Badcock Gardiner, named Chudleigh, probably after Chudleigh in Devon, England. During the 19th century a town hall, four churches, a school, an inn, post office, police station and telegraph office were built. Over time the churches, school, inn and post office have closed. A rail line from Deloraine to Mole Creek served the town from 1890 till its closure in 1985. The town has a privately run wildlife park, a shop selling and making honey products, and a few other stores. As part of a beautification drive in 2001, the main street was planted with roses, and the town is now promoted as a \\"village of roses\\". Geography Lobster Rivulet, a tributary of the Mersey River, flows through the locality from west to east, where it forms part of the north-eastern boundary. Chudleigh lies west of Launceston and east of Mole Creek in northern Tasmania, Australia. The town is in the fertile Chudleigh Valley that is bounded by the Gog and Magog ranges, to the north, and the Great Western Tiers, to the south-west. The town itself is just south of the Lobster rivulet, a tributary of the Mersey river which also runs near the town to the north.Whitworth, pp.38‚Äì39 The land around the town is mostly suited to grazing, intensive grazing in some areas, though some is marginal cropping land that requires careful crop rotation interspersed with seasons where the land is left fallow.Topoclimate Services, p.27 The hills of the area have prominent basalt, limestone and dolerite depending on location. The fertile flats are of alluvial origin with Permian period sediments that have formed mudstone and sandstone.Topoclimate Services, pp.25-26 Some areas are notably frosty in winter and experience occasional snowfall.Topoclimate Services, p.24 History Aboriginal Tasmanians have lived on the island of Tasmania for thousands of years. The earliest archaeological evidence for Aboriginal habitation of Tasmania is from the valley of the Forth River, 35,000 years before the present.Jupp, p.110 Prior to European settlement, Chudleigh was part of the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal tribe. Their range included Deloraine, east of Chudleigh, and the Gog mountain range to the north-west where they mined ochre in the Toolumbunner ochre pits.Jupp, p.111 The Pallittorre people lived in the area and used to have a camping ground, where the Church of England cemetery was established later. Land clearing, road construction, disease and conflicts with settlers drove them from their lands and decimated the population. Their population in the area has been estimated to drop from 200 to 60 during 1827-30. At the time of settlement the Chudleigh area was covered with bogs and wild bush. The restored former Van Diemen's Land company's grain store, built 1827‚Äì8 During the early 1820s the Van Diemen's Land Company created a track or stock route from Deloraine to Emu Bay (now Burnie) that ran via Chudleigh and Mole Creek. The route enabled them to move grazing livestock from the higher rainfall areas in the west of Tasmania, to the population centres further east. The company built facilities, including a store, in Chudleigh.Evans & Terry, p.9 Europeans settled the area west of Deloraine from the early 1800s,Reunion Committee, p.3 and cattle were being grazed--illegally--in the Chudleigh area from as early as 1823.Evans & Terry, p.10 John Badcock Gardiner, who probably named Chudleigh after the village with the same name in Devon, England, was granted in the area after arriving in Tasmania in 1829 with his family.Australian Garden History Society, p.7 The town's area was first granted to Lieutenant Travers Hartley Vaughan in 1830. Vaughan sold the land in 1837 to Henry Reed, merchant, who was later briefly a member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council. An early industry in the area was limestone mining and lime production.Reunion Committee, p.65 By 1831 a lime burning industry had been established. The lime was sent to Launceston for use in construction.Australian Garden History Society, p.5 The town of Chudleigh was surveyed and marked into town blocks, many of them . The date of this survey is not recorded but it was likely done by John Batman, founder of Melbourne, prior to 1835. The town was laid out to hold a population of 5,000, as it was intended to be a railway junction on a line from Launceston to North West Tasmania. Later road and transport developments caused the idea of such a large settlement at Chudleigh to be abandoned.Reunion Committee, p.9 Dan Picket, an ex-convict who has been granted a ticket of leave, built the first hotel, the two-storey Chudleigh Inn, around 1850. The building was later reduced to a single storey. This hotel or inn was noted as being used by 1851. A police watch house was completed c.1860.Reunion Committee, p.63 By 1862 an extensive system of caves had been discovered in the area, attracting visitors. In the 1860s a single- room school building was constructed. The school opened 1 July 1864 with 14 pupils and a single teacher, though it apparently closed sometime after and reopened 28 January 1883 with a larger class of 34 pupils.The Mercury in 1883 notes school attendance as more normally 20 In 1884 a new building, and teacher's residence, was completed at a cost of 1531 pounds. The new school was on the road to Mole Creek near the bridge over Lobster Rivulet, and had around 26‚Äì27 students. The school suffered regular flooding of the building, access roads and paths. Due to this flooding it was moved, in the 1930s, to next to the Methodist chapel in Sorrell street. The school was extended in 1936 and remained in operation until closed, by the Tasmanian education department due to low student numbers, on 30 September 1965. From then students had to travel to the school at Mole Creek.Reunion Committee, pp.26,32-33 The township of Chudleigh was formally declared in 1866.Evans & Terry, p.49 It continued to expand and by 1883 also had a post and telegraph office, two stores, two churches, and over a dozen houses. An agricultural and horticultural show was first held in 1889. The Chudleigh Agricultural and Horticultural Society has run the show annually since, except for breaks from 1914‚Äì28 and 1939‚Äì45 due to the two World Wars. The show has been run on various grounds, but the present one has been used since it was purchased in 1932.Reunion Committee, p.59 Chudleigh's town hall was completed in 1895, and opened during a public event on 11 April that year. It was funded by public subscription and built local builder Davis Brothers on donated land. It was built as a weather board building set on stone foundations, with a corrugated iron roof. There was a near tragedy in the hall in late 1922 when a generator caught fire while the hall was being used by 300 people. The inwards opening doors and lack of a fire door were cited as significant problems. Chudleigh had a post office from 1865.Evans & Terry, p.28 Around 1899 it was moved to a new buildingReunion Committee, p.57 though it has since been closed and the building sold as a private home. Chudleigh had a registered maternity hospital in the early 20th century. For some time the town had an Australian rules football club. It closed in the 1930s, reformed in 1939, then finally closed in the 1980s. Telegraph communication followed construction of the railway line in the late 19th century. The first telephones were installed in Chudleigh homes in the 1930s, and mains electricity in the 1940s.Evans & Terry, pp.29,53 Chudleigh was gazetted as a locality in 1965. Religion Chudleigh has had churches for four different Christian denominations, though none remain.The last church in Chudleigh closed in 1984. An Anglican cemetery was opened in 1864.. Construction of an Anglican (then the Church of England) church began in 1866 and the building was completed in 1868. This church, the Church of the Good Shepard, was in the parish of Deloraine. It was replaced with a new building, built by local carpenter Hugh Miles, in 1880. The new building was consecrated in 1895.Henslowe, p.19 It held services until 1976, was later sold, and is now a private residence.Reunion Committee, p.51 A Presbyterian cemetery was established in 1860.Australian Garden History Society, p.15 By 1877 a Presbyterian church had been built in what is now Burnett street, though it was later destroyed by fire. A small Salvation Army citadel, comprising a number of buildings, was established in Jones street in 1878. It was closed in 1938 and one of the buildings transported to Invermay, Tasmania where it was used as a Salvation Army band room. A Wesleyan chapel was built prior to 1877, around from Chudleigh, next to Lobster Rivulet. Methodist services began in the town in 1874, but ceased in 1876 when the pulpit was taken over by a Presbyterian minister. Land for a church was purchased in the town in April 1885.Stansall, p.65 The building, and adjacent stables, were completed soon after and the opening service held 19 July 1885. To allow for an extension the building was later moved, and the stables removed. In 1977 the church became, along with most Methodist churches in Australia, part of the Uniting Church in Australia. It was closed in 1984 due to a lack of parishioners, and sold to become a private home.Reunion Committee, p.47 Railway A rail line was built from Mole Creek to Deloraine, through Chudleigh. It ran from a junction on the western line and opened on 5 April 1890.Stokes, pp.243-252 The rail line was used for mail, freight and passengers; occasional passenger services went as far as Devonport. Passenger services mostly ceased when they were replaced with a bus service in 1960. The line continued to be used for transporting logs for some time after this.Reunion Committee, pp.53-55 Throughout its existence, the line was primarily used to carry timber to the paper mill at Burnie and, in later days, woodchips to Bell Bay. Passenger services had been mostly self-propelled railcars after the 1920s. The line was closed in 1985, and the tracks lifted in 1992.Stokes, pp.243-252 Road infrastructure The B12 route (Mole Creek Road) enters from the east and runs through to the south-west, where it exits. Route C169 (Caveside Road) starts at an intersection with B12 and runs south- west until it exits. Present Waterfall on Lobster Rivulet Chudleigh serves as a service centre for the surrounding area, whose main industries involve farming and timber. The town has few services. There is a shop producing and selling honey related products, a service station, general store, second-hand book store and a shop selling gifts and home wares related to roses. There are a large number of roses planted in the main street as part of a beautification drive, begun in 2001, to make the town a \\"village of roses\\".Australian Garden History Society, p.13 There are some historic buildings, with connection to the town's early history. Bentley house's landscape is on the Tasmanian Heritage Register and the house itself is registered by the Tasmanian Heritage Council.Australian Garden History Society, pp.1,4 Cattle were farmed on the land from at least 1827 and the house was finished in 1879, at which time the property was owned by Donald Norman Cameron, later member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly.Australian Garden History Society, p.8 At the south-east corner of the town, on the main road, is a restored building that was made for the Van Diemen's Land company in 1827‚Äì8 as a grain store.Reunion Committee, p.71 A sign commemorates acrimony around its restoration or remodelling, stating \\"Building restored November 2003. Despite the best efforts of The National Trust and Mrs Patrica Woods.\\". Patrica Woods was as the time president of the National Trust of Australia (Tasmania). The main street has a surveyor's cottage that was built around 1840 The Chudleigh show, run by the Agricultural and Horticultural society, is held each February. It is one of the state's oldest agricultural shows; in 2015 the 126th show was held. Melita honey farm runs a shop on the main street that sells a wide variety of honey related products. Mole Creek Karst National Park is nearby. Caves in the park thread through the limestone that underlies the area around Chudleigh. Nearby the town is the Lobster Rivulet Forest Reserve, which contains a series of scenic waterfalls. Trowunna Wildlife Park is a private sanctuary a short distance on the main road towards Mole Creek. The park contains native Australian animals both in enclosures and free-ranging. It works as part of the effort to preserve Tasmanian devils by keeping a population that are free of facial tumour disease, and runs as a training centre for animal handling and animal keeping. Chudleigh is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Division of Lyons‚Äîfor the state house of assembly and the federal house of representatives‚Äî and the state legislative council electoral division of Western Tiers. Demographics The town's population, including the surrounding district, was reported in 1877 as approximately 1000.. Chudleigh had a population of 162 in 1901 and 200 in 2000. There were around 150 people living in 40 houses just within the town's boundaries in 2002. As of the 335 people lived in the town and surrounding area. Climate Tasmania has an oceanic temperate climate characterised by cool summer and mild winters, with a small maximum temperature variation during the year. Chudleigh lies in the rain shadow of the Great Western Tiers; rainfall in parts of the tiers exceeds . Since the 1950s average temperatures in the surrounding Meander Valley have steadily risen and since the 1970s average rainfall has declined.

Written between 1773 and 1779, it was published in part in the periodical Der teutsche Merkur (The German Mercury) in 1774 and was first issued as a collection in book form in 1780. It satirises the pettiness of the inhabitants of small-town Germany, using the ancient Greek town of Abdera as a stand-in for the contemporary German towns which Wieland was critiquing. Synopsis The book is set in the ancient Greek town of Abdera in Thrace and is divided into five chapters, each depicting a different aspect of the Abderites' foolishness. In the first, Demokritus unter der Abderiten, the philosopher Democritus returns to his home town but finds that the inhabitants doubt his sanity. The second chapter, Hippocrates in Abdera, portrays the physician Hippocrates evaluating Democritus and finding him sane, but the townspeople mad. Euripides in Abdera, the third chapter, is principally a literary satire that reflects the contemporary German enthusiasm for the theatre, while the fourth chapter, Der Proze√ü um des Esels Schatten, depicts a legal battle between an ass driver and the animal's hirer, highlighting the extreme litigiousness of the Abderites. In the final part, Die Fr√∂sche der Latona, divisions between rival sects of frog-worshippers mean that the Abderites fail to take action against the town's sacred frogs and consequently find themselves being driven out of their homes. At the end of the book, Wieland makes his satirical intent clear with the statement that although Abdera had long since disappeared, the Abderites still exist and are to be found in every town and city in Germany. Background Wieland intended the book to serve as a satire of the parochial and self-satisfied nature of provincial German life, using Abdera as the setting. The town was notorious in ancient times for the small-mindedness of its inhabitants, with the notable exception of Democritus. It was ridiculed by Cicero and described as a \\"republic of fools\\"; it became a symbol of folly to the ancient Greeks, where things happened in the opposite way to how they would normally be expected. Wieland sought not only to satirise the petty-minded and Philistine nature of the small-town German bourgeoisie but to attack the excessive enthusiasm for Classical ideals that he perceived at the time. Ironically, he had himself previously worked to promote Classical ideals but now felt that the populace had become too earnest and uncritical in adopting them.

Provisions  A Bill to consolidate certain enactments relating to co-operative societies, community benefit societies and other societies registered or treated as registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965, with amendments to give effect to recommendations of the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission.Cm8768  Effects The Act renamed industrial and provident societies as co-operative or community benefit societies. The Act effectively implemented the renaming provisions first enacted in the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 2010 and coincided with a number of other changes foreshadowed by the 2010 Act, such as the application of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 to society directors (known as committee members in the legislation) by the commencement of section 3 of the 2010 Act from 1 April 2014. Since 1 August 2014, a new society must register as either a co- operative or a community benefit society rather than, as had been the case, an industrial and provident society that met either requirement. Societies already registered before that date remain registered under the 2014 Act. Sections 1 and 2 provide that all three types of society (co-operative societies, community benefit societies and societies already registered before 1 August 2014) are referred to together as \\"registered societies\\".http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/14/section/1 & http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/14/section/2 However, for administrative purposes, the three types of society are categorised separately. The Act applies to Great Britain but not Northern Ireland.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/14/section/153 The 2014 Act consolidated previous legislation and modernised its language. Its enactment coincided with a number of reforms to the law applying to societies which were implemented by secondary legislation. They included the application of insolvency rescue procedures such as administration and creditors' voluntary arrangements, to societies by The Industrial and Provident Societies and Credit Unions (Arrangements, Reconstructions and Administration) Order 2014 SI 2014/229;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/229/contents/made increased Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) powers of investigation and inspection of societies under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions (Investigations) Regulations 2014 SI 2014/574http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/574/regulation/1/made and an increase in the holding limit for withdrawable shares in societies from ¬£20,000 to ¬£100,000 in s. 24 of the Act. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/14/section/24 Societies are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority, which registers them and applies the statutory tests about whether a society meets on registration and continues to meet the requirements of s. 1 and 2 of the Act.http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/firm-types/mutual-societies/industrial Co- operative and community benefit societies Co-operative or community benefit societiesSee for more detail: Ian Snaith (ed), Handbook of Co-operative and Community Benefit Society Law, Co-operatives Uk and Jordan Publishing 2014 may in general conduct any legal business. However, co-operative societies are restricted by section 2(3) of Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, which lays down that, for the purposes of the legislation, a \\"co- operative society\\" does not include \\"a society that carries on, or intends to carry on, business with the object of making profits mainly for the payment of interest, dividends or bonuses on money invested or deposited with, or lent to, the society or any other person\\". Consumer, worker, agricultural and housing co-operatives, working men's clubs, Women's Institute markets, allotment societies, mutual investment companies, friendly societies and housing associations usually incorporate as societies, as do some social enterprises. This process is facilitated by the existence of \\"model rules\\" developed by various federal bodies, which reduce the legal costs. The Financial Conduct Authority maintains a list of these bodies which can be downloaded from their web site. Credit unions and building societies, which sprang from the same roots, are now governed by specific legislation although credit unions are, through their legislation, registered under the 2014 Act - see the Credit Unions Act 1979 and the Building Societies Act 1986 and later legislation. Credit Unions and Building Societies are both regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority as deposit takers. Industrial and provident societies fell into two broad categories from 1939 to 2014. That is now reflected in the new registration system under Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 * Co-operatives - these trade for the mutual benefit of their members, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as registrar will judge the legality of their initial or continued registration by reference to co-operative principles (case law is very thin on the ground compared with that for companies); * Community benefit societies (also known as 'societies for the benefit of the community' or 'bencoms') - these trade to benefit the broader community, and the FCA will refer to consider whether they satisfy that requirement by prohibiting any distribution of assets or profits to members and generally whether their aims are charitable or more widely philanthropic so as to offer \\"community benefit\\". In 2015, the FCA was still consulting on draft guidelines about how it will apply the statutory requirements to societies. At present those community benefit societies (in England and Wales) that meet the requirements for charitable status are accepted as such by the taxation authority, HM Revenue and Customs, rather than by the Charity Commission. This exempt charityCharities Act 1993, Schedule 2 status (the exemption is from registering with the Commission) is gradually being removed for entities with no 'lead regulator'. However, the process was still not complete at 2015 according to the Charity Commission publication on Exempt Charities.

He grew up in a family of doctors ‚Äì his mother was a gynaecologist who later became a GP. Hannan is a board member of the Tameside and Glossop Clinical Commissioning Group. General practice He took over Haughton Thornley Medical Centres in Hyde, the practice which was formerly run by Dr Harold Shipman when he started his career. There is a large Bengali population. It is a very deprived neighbourhood. He saw opening records to patients as a way of rebuilding trust in a difficult situation. He told the BBC: \\"The week before I started there was a sit-down protest in the waiting room, because the patients were not happy about this doctor that was being foisted on them. That gives you some idea of the battlefield I was walking into.\\" 150 patients at the practice were given access to their medical records and test results over the internet in 2007. Prof Steve Field of the Care Quality Commission recounted: ‚ÄúIt was very difficult to recruit to Shipman‚Äôs practice because of [the lack of] trust locally. But Amir said, ‚ÄòRight from the start I will share everything with my patients, and gave them access to all their own records. He‚Äôs got examples of patients being admitted to hospital where they have had to show the consultants their record which may have saved their lives. It‚Äôs policy to try and make it happen. But it‚Äôs not moving quickly enough.‚Äù , 34% of the patient population were accessing to their GP record. There was no difference between the proportion of Bengali patients doing so and the rest of the practice population. Record access He was one of the first GPs pioneering Patient record access using EMIS software. He says \\"there are some doctors and nurses who have genuine concerns about patients suddenly being let loose to access their records without any controls in place or without clinicians having to do anything and a feeling of irresponsibility that that raises.\\" Jacqui Gladwin, a nursing lecturer who is one of his patients, was worried about online access. She asked:\\"What happens if patients see information that is incorrect? How safe is the system? What happens if they see something distressing when the surgery is closed?\\" She was surprised to find that other patients in the practice did not share her worries. At a meeting at the practice to discuss the development of records access, several patients had found errors in their records. They were positive about being able to identify errors and the response they had received when they reported them. They felt trusted to own the information, and secure when travelling abroad that they could allow other health professionals to access their medical information. He speaks regularly about the benefits of giving patients access to their full GP electronic health records, and about how this works at his practice. And in 2008 he authored the Patient Access to Medical Records pattern of the Liberating Voices pattern language. Research in which Hannan participated showed that practices who give at least a third of their patients full online access to their records could experience a decrease in appointment demand of up to 12%. Dr Brian Fisher, one of the other participants in the study conceded that as the practices concerned were leaders in their field with regard to offering online access to medical records, it could be difficult to extrapolate the results. He has defended the government's Summary Care Record project, which has been criticised by other GPs on the grounds of cost. Each time an SCR was accessed for a patient in 2012 it cost ¬£1,200. He says \\"The SCR isn‚Äôt a panacea, it‚Äôs just one solution\\". He was, however, critical of the care.data fiasco, saying \\"If patients felt that their data was leaking out, and I had not warned them about it, then that would destroy my relationship with them.\\" He was ranked in the Health Service Journal's list of Clinical Leaders in 2015.

It is easiest distinguished from C. madagascariensis by its unkeeled gular and ventral scales, which are keeled in the latter species. Other subtle differences include the mental scale being in contact with four postmentals (rather than 5‚Äì8), slightly shorter limbs, and fewer spines in its dorsal crest.

It has been widely grown around the Mediterranean since it appeared in Italy (between 1810 and 1818), but was not found in the orient until it was exported there. It is one of the most commercially important citrus. Its sweet fruit is eaten, its rind oil is used to flavour food and drinks, and petitgrain oil is extracted from the pruned leaves. Flower (particularly petals) are also rich in essential oils. This species produce those which are perhaps the tastiest of all citrus fruits. That's why, its scientific name is Citrus √ó deliciosa, which means, delicious citrus. The production of Mediterranean mandarin has suffered a sharp decline since the middle of the 20th century because of the perishability of the fruits and the tendency for an alternating production with years of low production and years of excessive tree load, but consumers who require more intense citrus aromas and fragrances continue to enjoy this mandarin. Therefore, this mandarin has a commercial space for different markets that value the traditional cultivars. This is the case of the PGI \\"Citrinos do Algarve\\". These characteristics and its time of maturity, which implies being little affected by Ceratitis capitata, make Mediterranean mandarin recommended for organic farming.

Kingdom of Armenia  Arshakuni king - Artaxias IV, by Smbat III Bagratuni The Bagratuni family became princes in the 4th century. Their heritable rights were given to them by the Arshakuni Dynasty, the kings of Armenia (52-428). They were called aspets and crowned Arshakuni kings. Their domain included the region of Sper in Upper Armenia, which was famous for its gold, and Tayk. Smbat I was the first member of the dynasty. He was aspet during the reign of Armenia's first Christian king, Tiridates III the Great (287-330). The last Armenian king, who was crowned by Bagratunis, was Artaxias IV (423-428). The aspet was Smbat III, who was known from Vramshapuh king's times (389-415).  Persian and Byzantine occupation  The ancestors of Smbat III were the most famous princes (nakharars) during the occupation of the Roman Empire and Sassanid Persia. Armenia had been divided between them since 387. Tirots, one of the ancestors of Smbat III, allied with Armenian marzbane. Sahak II and Smbat IV were marzbans of Armenia. The rulers of the dynasty traditionally continued to be \\"aspets\\". After the second division of Armenia, the domains of the Bagratuni family became part of Byzantine Empire. Smbat IV was among the princes who rebelled against them.  Arabic Caliphate  Coat of arms of Bagrationi dynasty, Georgian branch of Bagratunis During the Arabic period (7-9th centuries), the Bagratuni family was one of the most powerful princely dynasties of Armenia. Their main competitors were sparapets of the Mamikonian family who were Byzantine-oriented. Princes of Armenia were chosen from these two families and sometimes the people, who were under their influence. Princes were the second most powerful people after the ostikan. The competition was ended by the victory of Bagratunis, who founded an independent kingdom. First, the title of Prince of Armenia changed to Prince of Princes. Then, the prince of princes became sparapets who were the constables of the army. In the beginning of the 9th century, a powerful prince, Ashot Msaker, united Taron, Tayk and Ayrarat, taking them under his control and thus making them part of his domain. Later, he united Moxoene, Gugark, Georgia and Caucasian Albania. He then took over Artsrunis of Vaspurakan and Syunis of Syunik. As a result, all of Arminiya came under his control. Princes of Armenia and sparapets were from the family of Smbat VIII. His son, Ashot, became the king of Armenia. Sons of Bagarat II, brother of Smbat VIII, became the princes of Taron. Their sister, Hripsime, became the princess of principality of Vaspurakan. Her husband was the first prince Hamazasp II, Artsruni. Before independence, the Tayk of Bagratuni became an independent principality. Its ruler, Ashot, became the head of the Georgian Bagrationi dynasty. It ruled in Georgia for one thousand years (9-19th centuries). The last prince of Armenia was Ashot (855-885), son of Smbat VIII, who later became the first king (885-890).  Bagratid kingdom of Armenia   Bagratunis of Taron  Sasuntzi Davith, the hero of Armenian epic poetry. According to one version, Ashot II and David Arkayik are the personages of creating him Taron (Turuberan) became a part of Bagratunis' domain in the beginning of the 9th century, when Ashot Msaker was Prince of Armenia (790-826). As a prince of Taron, he is counted as Ashot I (804-826). After his death, prince of princes, Bagrat, inherited Taron, the south of the domain, and Smbat, Ayrarat, which was the northern part. Bagrat was the second in the dynasty. Bagrat I was an aspet in the 4th century. However, in Taron, he was the first Bagrat, so he ruled as Bagrat I of Taron (826-851), because there were no Bagrats before him. His sons and grandsons ruled until 966. After, Taron became a part of Byzantine Empire. Previous seniors, princes of Taron, of the Mamikonian family, were strong in the region, even during the ruling of the last prince, Ashot III. They became relatives with the Bagratunis, and as a result of that, there were two more princes in Taron in his last days. They were Bagrat III and Grigor II, who were half-Mamikonians and half-Bagratunis. Later, the Tronite branch of the Bagratunis and Mamikonians became one family. Some of them ruled in Sasun (Tornikians) and the others in Moush (Taronites).  Kings of Armenia  After the death of Ashot Msaker (826) and Bagrat II Bagratuni (851), Smbat VIII became the prince of Armenia. His family was the ruling royal family for 200 years, in Armenia, Georgia and Albania. Because of this long rule, they were called king of kings (shahnshah). Bagratuni dynasty300px The son of Smbat VIII, Ashot, became the first Bagratuni king. He had four sons and three daughters, whom he married to Artsruni and Syuni princes. Thus, the strongest families of Armenia became one family and began to rule the country. Ashot's brother, Shapuh, became sparapet, the constable of the Armenian army. The capital was Bagaran, which was throne-city of Ashot Msaker (790-826). Ashot 's son, Smbat (890-914), moved the capital to Yerazgavors. It was the capital for about forty years until King Abas moved it to Kars. Ashot III the Merciful, king of Armenia (953-977), built a new capital around the fortress of Ani. It was the last capital of the Armenian kingdom, so it is also called Kingdom of Ani. His brother, Mushegh, stayed in Kars and founded Kingdom of Kars (963-1065) under the sovereignty of Ashot III. Later, the king of Armenia, Smbat II, allowed his brother Gurgen to organize a new kingdom in north which became the Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget (978-1113). Smbat Syuni did the same in the east creating the Kingdom of Syunik-Baghk. The third son of Ashot III, Gagik, was the last powerful king of Armenia (990-1020). After his death, the kingdom was divided into two parts, between the brothers, Hovhannes-Smbat and Ashot. The last king was Gagik II (1042-1045), son of Ashot. In 1079, Gagik II was killed. In 1080, Gagik of Kars and his sons, Hovhannes and David, also died. The son of Hovhannes, Ashot, was also killed in Ani. As a result, the royal branch of the Bagratunis ended with Ani and Kars. The last royal branch, the Kiurikian family, remained in Lori. Armenian prince Ruben killed the murderers of Gagik II and inherited the throne from him. In 1080, he founded the Armenian principality of Cilicia (1080-1198), which became a kingdom (1198-1375). Consequently, the royal heritage of the Armenian Bagratuni family is either Georgian Bagrationis, or Rubinians, Hetumids and Lusignans in Cilicia, or the Kiurikians. Non-royal or princely branches have many more than these three royal branches.  Kiurikians  Bagratuni dynasty300px The Kiurikians were a royal and princely family from Armenia from the 10th through 14th centuries. The founder is Gurgen or Kiurike, son of Ashot III the Merciful (953-977). At first, they ruled only in Tashir-Dzoraget (Lori Province) but later in Tavush as well. Grandsons of Gurgen-Kiurike were kings of Tashir-Dzoraget and eastern Georgia (Kingdom of Kakheti). In the 12th century, Kakhety and Lori annexed to Georgia. The Kiurikians remained in Tavush. Later they divided into Matsnaberd and Nor-berd branches. The last prince, Sargis of Matsnaberd, ruled in the 13th century. Nothing is known about him, his parents (probably Aghsartan), or their offspring.

Unraced as a two-year-old, he showed some promise as a three-year-old in 2006, winning one minor race and finishing fourth in the St Leger. He improved in the following year despite running only three races: he won the Ormonde Stakes and the Cumberland Lodge Stakes and was narrowly beaten in the Canadian International Stakes. He won the Gordon Richards Stakes in 2008 but reached his peak as a six-year-old in the following year, winning the Yorkshire Cup, Coronation Cup and Prix Royal Oak as well as finishing third in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. After a single, unsuccessful start in 2010 his racing career was ended by injury. He was then retired to become a National Hunt stallion in Ireland. Background Ask is a bay horse with a white star and snip bred at the Side Hill Stud in Newmarket by his owner the 11th Duke of Devonshire. He was one of the eighteenth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Ask's dam Request, who failed to win in two races, was owned and bred by Queen Elizabeth II. She was a granddaughter of the Queen's outstanding racemare Highclere, who won the 1000 Guineas and the Prix de Diane in 1974 and whose other descendant include Nashwan, Unfuwain and Deep Impact. The Duke of Devonshire sent his colt into training with Michael Stoute at Newmarket. Racing career 2006: three-year-old season Ask made his racecourse debut when finishing third in the Wood Ditton Stakes, for previously unraced three-year-olds at Newmarket Racecourse in April and then finished second when odds-on favourite for a maiden race at Windsor on 3 June. Before his second race a share in the horse had been sold to Susan Magnier of the Coolmore organization. Later that month he started 2/9 favourite in an eight-runner field for a similar event over one and a half miles at Chepstow Racecourse and won easily by seven lengths. He finished unplaced when favourite for a valuable handicap at Goodwood on 2 August and then finished second in the Melrose Handicap at York three weeks later. In both of these starts he was ridden by Ryan Moore, who partnered him in most of his subsequent races. On his final appearance of the year, Ask was stepped up sharply in class and started a 16/1 outsider for the Classic St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse on 9 September. He raced just behind the leaders for most of the way and stayed on in the straight to finish fourth of the eleven runners, three and a half lengths behind the winner Sixties Icon. 2007: four-year-old season Before the start of the 2007 season, Ask entered the ownership of Patrick J. Fahey. On his first appearance as a four-year-old, Ask started 5/2 second favourite behind the 2005 St Leger winner Scorpion in the Group 3 Ormonde Stakes over thirteen and a half furlongs at Chester Racecourse on 11 May. Ridden by Kerrin McEvoy he took the lead two furlong out and accelerated clear to win \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths from Scorpion. Following his win at Chester, Ask was off the course for four and a half months before returning at Ascot Racecourse on 30 September in the Group 3 Cumberland Lodge Stakes. He started the 11/4 second favourite behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Honolulu who had finished third in the St Leger two weeks earlier. After being restrained by Moore in the early stages he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two lengths from Zaham, with Honolulu three quarter of a length away in third. Three weeks later Ask was sent to Canada to contest the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racecourse and started favourite in a twelve-runner field. After being held up in the early stages and turning into the straight he produced a strong late run but failed by a short head to overhaul the American gelding Cloudy's Knight. 2008: five-year-old season Ask began his third season in the Group Three Gordon Richards Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 25 April. He started 8/13 favourite and won by half a length from Hattan, who had won the Winter Derby in March. In his next three races, Ask was tried against the best middle- distance horses in Europe. He finished fifth behind Duke of Marmalade in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, fifth behind the same horse in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in July and sixth behind Zarkava in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse on 5 October. Ask was dropped in class for the Group Three St Simon Stakes at Newbury Racecourse three week later. Ridden by Christophe Soumillon he started odds-on favourite but finished last of the seven runners behind Bucellati. 2009: six-year-old season On his first appearance of 2009, Ask was moved up in distance for the Group Two Yorkshire Cup over fourteen furlongs at York on 15 May. Moore restrained the horse in the first half of the race before making steady progress and taking the lead approaching the last quarter mile. In the closing stages Ask drew away from his opponents to win by six lengths from Blue Bajan. The Racing Post described the performance as a \\"thrilling\\" display and said that he \\"destroyed\\" the opposition. On 5 June 2009 Ask started at odds of 5/1 for the 106th running of the Coronation Cup over one and a half miles at Epsom. His opponents included Youmzain (the 2/1 favourite), Look Here, Duncan, Frozen Fire, Eastern Anthem (Dubai Sheema Classic) and Buccelati. Frozen Fire led from the outsider Expresso Star with Moore positioning Ask in third before moving the six-year-old into the lead two furlongs out. Youmzain quickly moved up alongside, and both Look Here and Duncan made rapid progress on the outside to challenge for the lead. In a four-way struggle to the line, Ask rallied after looking beaten and prevailed by a nose from Youmzain, with Look Here a nose away in third and Duncan three-quarters of a length back in fourth place. Commenting on the horse's first win at the highest level Ryan Moore commented \\"I'm just delighted as he deserves one. He's been knocking on the door for a long time and the steady pace didn't really suit him. He was very game up the straight as twice he was beat and he battled home really well.\\" On 25 July at Ascot, Ask (ridden by Olivier Peslier) ran for the second time in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. In a finish dominated by Michael Stoute- trained runners he finished third behind his four-year-old stablemates Conduit and Tartan Bearer. Ask ended his season with a run in the Prix Royal Oak over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 25 October and started 7/4 favourite ahead of the five-time Group One winner Schiaparelli, the Irish St. Leger runner-up Clowance and the Prix Chaudenay winner Manighar. Ask raced in third place as Schiaparelli set the pace and then went three lengths clear of the field in the straight. In the closing stages Ask steadily reeled in the German horse, taking the lead 100 metres from the finish and winning by one and a half lengths. The result was only confirmed after a lengthy enquiry by the racecourse stewards into interference allegedly caused by Ask early in the straight. 2010: seven-year-old season Ask remained in training as a seven-year-old and was trained with the Ascot Gold Cup as his objective. At Royal Ascot on 17 June, Ask started 11/4 favourite for the Gold Cup ahead of Manifest (Yorkshire Cup), Kite Wood (Prix Vicomtesse Vigier), Kasbah Bliss (Prix Gladiateur) and Bannaby (Prix du Cadran). He was in contention until the last half mile but then weakened and finished fifth of the twelve runners, some thirty lengths behind the winner Rite of Passage. He was being prepared for a run in the Irish St. Leger when he sustained a tendon injury in a training gallop and was retired from racing. Assessment In the 2008 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Ask was given a rating of 119, making him the 52nd best racehorse in the world. In the following year he moved up to 121 and was ranked in 33rd place.http://www.horseracingintfed.com/resources/WTRRankings/2009_WorldRankings.asp Michael Stoute said that \\"Ask was as tough and genuine a racehorse as one could wish to train\\". Stud record Ask was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion for Coolmore at the Beeches Stud in County Waterford where he was advertised as a National Hunt stallion.

Hancock was a donor to the University of Southern California with Velero III eventually becoming R/V Velero III in research associated with the university and a sculpture of the vessel appears on the Hancock Institute for Marine Studies at U.S.C. The ship was purchased for war use by the Navy on December 15, 1941 and being commissioned as the USS Chalcedony designated PYC-16 on weather duty for the Hawaiian Sea Frontier. In 1947 the vessel was being operated as the yacht Velero III for Nicholas A. Kessler and in 1948 was registered to Independent Tankships as the yacht Ahmady with the home port of Wilmington, Delaware. In 1949 the vessel was being operated under the Kuwati flag. Origins George Allan Hancock had inherited Rancho La Brea and made his fortune in oil but had developed a scientific interest as a result of excavations at the La Brea Tar Pits on the ranch and, after exploring the pools on the ranch with his first boat, going to sea and eventually earning his master's papers. He had a number of boats with two earlier ones named Velero and Velero II. Captain Hancock took the first Velero from Los Angeles on January 30, 1921 on a cruise that was not scientific but later took Velero II as far as Panama with an amateur marine biologist that deepened his interest in scientific voyages. A Hancock owned and captained vessel following Velero II, Oaxaca, had carried twelve passengers including two representatives of the California Academy of Sciences on a voyage as far as the Gal√°pagos Islands in 1927. In 1931 Hancock had a new vessel constructed and returned to the name Velero with that being the third of the name. Construction and design Velero III was explicitly designed by naval architect G. Bruce Newby at Hancock's instruction to both appear and perform in a similar manner to the new United States Coast Guard cutters being built on the Pacific Coast. Interior spaces had many yacht like features but were intentionally simple but a \\"grand stairway\\" connected owner's and guest's quarters. The interior was insulated with cork and had forced ventilation. The steel vessel was length overall, in length at the waterline, in beam and a mean draft of . Propulsion was by two six cylinder Winton diesel engines of 850 shaft horsepower for a cruising speed of and, with a fuel oil capacity, a cruising range of at . Electrical power was provided by two 20 kilowatt belt driven generators on the main shaft and two 75 kilowatt generators driven by 115 shaft horsepower Winton engines with 900 ampere-hour batteries on line to provide power before generators are started or as emergency power. Fresh water, , was provided in two equally divided separate systems for drinking and another for washing and showering. Navigating equipment included Sperry gyrocompass and autopilot, radio range finder and a fathometer. Velero III carried two steel motor whaleboats and two wooden fishing and shore boats. Voyages Hancock's early voyages collected specimens but became organized into a more scientific collection with creation of the Allan Hancock Foundation for Scientific Research, the vessel itself becoming registered to the Allan Hancock Pacific Expeditions and Hancock Hall on the University of Southern California campus to house the collection. Velero III was donated with the foundation to the university in 1939. From 1931 until 1941 the vessel's collection efforts were largely in marine invertebrate zoology between San Francisco and Peru and at the end equaled or surpassed collection efforts in that field by previous ships with Hancock Hall at the University being built as a repository for the collection and data. An example of the work is found in the description of documentation of the early voyage extending from Mexico to the Gal√°pagos during which collection was made at twenty-three stations. Velero III expeditions included one exception to the Eastern Pacific work with a voyage into the Caribbean. Voyages between 1931 and presentation of the vessel to the university in 1939 were conducted by Captain Hancock. On one such trip to the Gal√°pagos Captain Hancock would attempt to identify two bodies found on Marchena Island and check on a colony of German \\"Back to nature\\" enthusiasts on Floreana Island, then known as Charles Island. Navy acquisition On December 15, 1941 Velero III was acquired by the Maritime Commission from the University of Southern California and turned over to the Navy which had the vessel converted to wartime use at San Diego Marine Construction Company before commissioning February 27, 1942 as USS Chalcedony designated PYC-16 with Lieutenant (junior grade) Erwin E. Smith, USNR commanding. Chalcedony served at San Diego with the 11th Naval District until sailing for Hawaii on April 21, 1942 for weather station duty with the Hawaiian Sea Frontier. On November 5, 1945 Chalcedony departed Pearl Harbor arriving San Francisco November 15 where she was decommissioned on January 10, 1946 and on October 17 delivered to the Maritime Commission for disposal. Post war At the end of the war Velero III was examined by Hancock for resuming foundation work but his conclusion was that a new vessel was required. In 1947 the vessel was being operated as the yacht Velero III for Nicholas A. Kessler, Los Angeles, and in 1948 was registered to Independent Tankships, Washington, D.C., as the yacht Ahmady with the home port of Wilmington, Delaware. In 1949 the vessel was being operated under the Kuwati flag.

Wilhelm (August 5, 1900 ‚Äì October 7, 1995) was an American chemist who helped to establish the United States Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory at Iowa State University. His uranium extraction process helped make it possible for the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bombs.  Early life  Harley A. Wilhelm was born on a farm near Ellston, Iowa, on August 5, 1900, one of seven children of Bert Clement and Annie Bell Wilhelm. He attended Ellston High School, where he was a varsity athlete as a freshman. He earned all-state athletic honors in his senior year. He graduated from Ellston High School in 1919, and entered Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, on an athletic scholarship. At Drake he played as a forward on the basketball team and a halfback on the football team. He was also a pitcher on the baseball team. He became interested in chemistry, and was awarded a fellowship to Iowa State College to study it there, but returned to Drake, where he received his Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree in 1923. After graduation, Wilhelm joined the faculty of the Intermountain Union College in Helena, Montana, where he taught chemistry and coached the football team. His coaching efforts were unsuccessful, and he returned to Iowa State as a graduate assistant, becoming an instructor in chemistry in 1929. He earned his Ph.D. in 1931, writing his thesis on \\"Band spectra produced by certain explosion mixtures\\" under the supervision of W. H. Jennings. He then joined the Iowa State faculty, becoming an assistant professor in 1940, and associate professor in 1944, and ultimately a full professor in 1945. He continued to play baseball, pitching for Ames Merchant, a semi-professional team for many years.  Manhattan Project  In February 1942, with the United States engaged in World War II, Arthur H. Compton established the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago as part of the Manhattan Project, to build nuclear reactors to create plutonium that would be used in atomic bombs. He recruited Frank Spedding from Iowa State College as the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's Chemistry Division. In turn, Spedding established a branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory at Iowa state College, and recruited Wilhelm as Associate Director to lead the metallurgical research. The intent was that the Iowa State College group would eventually join the rest of the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, but this never occurred, and the Ames Project grew into a laboratory in its own right. Spedding and Wilhelm began looking for ways to create the uranium metal. That being produced at the time was in the form of a powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. The Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched. To produce uranium metal, Spedding and Wilhelm tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. They then investigated a process (now known as the Ames process) originally developed by J. C. Goggins and others at the University of New Hampshire in 1926. This involved mixing uranium tetrachloride and calcium metal in a calcium oxide-lined steel pressure vessel (known as a \\"bomb\\") and heating it. They were able to reproduce Goggin's results in August 1942, and by September the Ames Laboratory was producing a ton of highly pure uranium metal a day. Starting in July 1943, Mallinckrodt, Union Carbide and DuPont began producing uranium by the Ames process, and Ames phased out its own production by early 1945. The Ames Laboratory also produced of extremely pure cerium for the cerium sulphide crucibles used by the plutonium metallurgists. Fears that world supplies of uranium were limited led to experiments with thorium, which could be irradiated to produce fissile uranium-233. A calcium reduction process was developed for thorium, and produced some .  Later life  After World War II, Spedding and Wilhelm founded the Institute of Atomic Research and the Ames Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission. Wilhelm became its associate director in 1945, serving in that capacity until 1966. He remained the principal scientist and professor of chemistry and metallurgy until he retired in 1970 at the mandatory retirement age of 70. The Ames Laboratory was initially established on the grounds of Iowa State College. Permanent buildings were constructed that were opened in 1948 and 1950, and subsequently named Wilhelm Hall and Spedding Hall respectively in 1986. His work at the Ames Laboratory ranged over a wide range of subjects, from the design of high- speed computers to environmental waste management and materials science. He individually or jointly held over 40 patents relating to chemistry and metallurgy, and 60 relating to atomic energy. He was part of the United States delegation to the 1955 International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva. Wilhelm received the Eisenman Award from the American Society of Metals in 1962, and the Gold Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1990, but he was more celebrated for his achievements as an athlete. In 1961, he was named one of the 100 greatest athletes in Drake University's history. He was one of 32 Drake alumni athletes who received the first Double D Awards in 1968, and he was inducted into the Iowa Boys High School Basketball Hall of Fame in 1988. In 2006, he was one of 80 basketball players selected as part of Drake University's all-decade teams. Wilhelm died in the Story City Memorial Hospital on October 7, 1995. He was survived by his daughters, Lorna Livingston, Gretchen Wilhelm and Myrna Elliott, and his son, Max Wilhelm. His wife Orpha Lutton Wilhelm died in 1991.

It contains a single species, Atychodracon megacephalus, named in 1846 originally as a species of Plesiosaurus. The holotype of \\"P.\\" megacephalus was destroyed during a World War II air raid in 1940 and was later replaced with a neotype. The species had a very unstable taxonomic history, being referred to four different genera by various authors until a new genus name was created for it in 2015. Apart from the destroyed holotype and its three partial casts (that survived), a neotype and two additional individuals are currently referred to Atychodracon megacephalus, making it a relatively well represented rhomaleosaurid. History of discovery The type species of Atychodracon was first described and named by Samuel Stutchbury in January 1846, as a species of the wastebasket taxon Plesiosaurus. The specific name means \\"large-headed\\" in Greek in reference to the very large skull compared to the rest of the skeletal elements \\"Plesiosaurus\\" megacephalus had, relatively to other / actual species of Plesiosaurus. The pliosauroid nature of \\"Plesiosaurus\\" megacephalus remained unnoted until a revision by Richard Lydekker in 1889. Lydekker recognized the rhomaleosaurid affinities of \\"P.\\" megacephalus, but because he and Harry G. Seeley \\"refused steadfastly to recognize the generic and specific names proposed by one another\\", he moved \\"P.\\" megacephalus to the genus Thaumatosaurus which was regarded by him as a replacement to Seeley's Rhomaleosaurus - creating the new combination T. megacephalus. The holotype of Atychodracon is BRSMG Cb 2335 and its casts and digital reproductions. BRSMG Cb 2335 represented a complete and articulated skeleton including the skull and lower jaw measuring 4.960 meters in total body length, and was one of several plesiosaurian specimens displayed in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery during the first half of the twentieth century. BRSMG Cb 2335, was collected from the Blue Lias Formation at the Street-on-the-Fosse village, located about 14 km northeast of Street, Somerset, England. The Blue Lias, also referred to as the Lower Lias, dates back to the Late Triassic - Early Jurassic boundary, thus includes the Rhaetian, Hettangian, and lower Sinemurian stages. BRSMG Cb 2335 came from the lowermost beds of the formation, and the area around Street probably originates below the first occurrence of Psiloceras planorbis ammonoid zone (pre-Planorbis beds), in the Psiloceras tilmanni Zone that immediately follows the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, meaning that an earliest Hettangian age is most likely for the specimen, about 201 million years ago. However, it is possible that some of the specimens from the area are from slightly younger deposits. BRSMG Cb 2335 was destroyed during a World War II air raid on 24 November 1940, however detailed descriptions and illustrations of the specimen as well as high quality historical photographs still exist to this day. Additionally, at least three casts are known, including: NHMUK R1309/1310 housed at the Natural History Museum, London, TCD.47762a+b at the Geology Museum, Trinity College Dublin, and BGS GSM 118410 at British Geological Survey, Keyworth, Nottingham. Each of the casts is a replica of parts of the original specimen, and comprises a representation of the skull, nine front neck vertebrae including the atlas-axis, and the right forelimb. In June 2014, three-dimensional digital models of BGS GSM 118410 were produced. Cruickshank (1994a) described LEICS G221.1851 as a neotype specimen for \\"P.\\" megacephalus due to the destruction of BRSMG Cb 2335. LEICS G221.1851, nicknamed \\"The Barrow Kipper\\", represents a complete and well preserved skeleton housed at the New Walk Museum in Leicester, and was discovered at Barrow-upon-Soar, of Leicestershire, England. It was collected by William Lee during the early 1850s, from the Psiloceras planorbis Zone of Bottom Floor Limestone Member of Blue Lias, 2 meters above the local Rhaetian, thus dating to the early Hettangian. However, a 2015 revision of \\"P.\\" megacephalus pointed out that according to International Code of Zoological Nomenclature article 51.1, designating a neotype in this case is not required since representations of the holotype exist, and are enough to define the species objectively. Thus, currently LEICS G221.1851 is treated as a specimen referred to Atychodracon megacephalus and not its type material. Two additional specimens, both housed at the National Museum of Ireland, are currently referable to A. megacephalus - NMING F10194, a partial skeleton that includes the skull but not the lower jaw from Street, and NMING F8749, a partial skeleton that includes a damaged skull and suffers from pyrite decay, from Barrow-upon-Soar. Both specimens also came from the lower Blue Lias, and likely date to the early Hettangian too. WARMS 10875, a complete skeleton from Wilmcote, Warwickshire was referred to \\"P.\\" megacephalus in older publications, e.g. Cruickshank (1994a). However, based on its distinctive morphology and the results of a preliminary phylogenetic analysis, WARMS 10875 seems to represent a new unnamed rhomaleosaurid species potentially related to Atychodracon and Eurycleidus. Description Restoration Atychodracon is a medium size carnivorous plesiosaurian, known from several individuals of about in total body length, with skulls measuring at about 80 cm. Among such early plesiosaurs, Atychodracon had a relatively large skull with the skull being 16% of its total length. The premaxillary part of its snout is about equal in width and length with five premaxillary teeth. Other characteristics seen on the holotype skull include a palatine bone that contacts the internal naris, and a front to back oriented channel in front of the external naris. The front of interpterygoid spacing is elongated front to back and narrow from the mid to the sides. Its parabasisphenoid was gently keeled, and the sides of the lower jaw are bowed from the mid to the sides. The mandibular symphysial region is expanded to the sides, nearly equal in width and length. The bottom surface of the dentary close to the mandibular symphysis, to which the splenials contribute on the mid bottom side, shows diverging bars and a midline longitudinal crest. An arrow cleft is present on midline between the dentaries and a large lingual foramen is present on the lower jaw. A medial boss is present on the retroarticular projection. Atychodracon, based solely on the holotype, has 29-30 neck vertebrae including the atlas bone and axis, about 32 tail vertebrae, a projection on the front surface of the cervical ribs, a straight preaxial humerus margin, poorly defined radius and ulna facets on the humerus, a slightly shorter humerus than femur, a shorter ulna than radius, and a tibia and fibula equal length. Among other rhomaleosaurids, the material of Atychodracon has been mainly referred to two genera prior to its separation, namely Rhomaleosaurus and Eurycleidus. Recent studies find little kinship between Atychodracon and true Rhomaleosaurus spp., aside from traits that are shared between most rhomaleosaurids. In fact, all phylogenetic analyses that included representatives of Rhomaleosaurus and specimens now referable to Atychodracon, didn't find any close affinity. On the other hand, several phylogenetic analyses recovered Eurycleidus as the sister taxon of Atychodracon when both are included, which seems to imply a close kinship between the taxa, as originally suggested by Andrews (1922). Yet, this is not supported by all analyses, and despite the difficulty in directly comparing the two, several differences exist. The holotype of Eurycleidus lacks a skull, and the previously referable OUM J.28585 probably represents a new taxon, so little overlapping material exists between the holotypes of Atychodracon and Eurycleidus. However the following differences are notable: in Eurycleidus the midline cleft on the bottom surface of the mandibular symphysis is not bordered by the splenials from the back, like in Atychodracon. In Eurycleidus, an additional large asymmetrical cleft separates the splenials on the midline. Unlike the straight preaxial margin of the humerus of Atychodracon, it is concave in Eurycleidus. Additionally, Atychodracon shows a more stout and robust humerus, and a reverse relation in the radius to ulna lengths (the former being shorter than the letter in Eurycleidus). These distinctions suggest that while Atychodracon is fairly closely related to Eurycleidus, it represents a separate genus. Classification In a revision of many pliosauroid taxa, Andrews (1922) was the first to recognize that \\"P.\\" megacephalus is morphologically more closely related to \\"Plesiosaurus\\" arcuatus than to species of the Rhomaleosaurus/Thaumatosaurus complex. He concluded that the two species belong to the same genus, which he erected as Eurycleidus, with the type species being Eurycleidus arcuatus, and E. megacephalus as a referred species. Nevertheless, this was not followed by all authors, such Swinton (1930) who used T. megacephalus and later in 1948 P. megacephalus, to avoid confusion soon after the holotype was destroyed. This conservative name, \\"P.\\" megacephalus, was followed by Taylor and Cruickshank (1989) and Taylor (1994). However, in 1994 Cruickshank designated a neotype for the species, and due to the Rhomaleosaurus/Thaumatosaurus issue being resolved in favor of the former (while Thaumatosaurus is a nomen dubium) he referred to it by the new combination, Rhomaleosaurus megacephalus. Adam S. Smith in his 2007 thesis on the anatomy and classification of the family Rhomaleosauridae, found the genus Rhomaleosaurus that became a wastebasket taxon itself to have only three valid species, and considered \\"P.\\" megacephalus to be rather a second species of Eurycleidus as suggested by Andrews (1922). Smith and Dyke (2008) recognized a fourth valid species in Rhomaleosaurus, and tentatively referred to \\"P.\\" megacephalus as \\"Rhomaleosaurus\\" megacephalus. However, they recognized the need for a new genus name for \\"P.\\" megacephalus, as was supported by their phylogenetic analysis of all valid Rhomaleosaurus species, and most valid rhomaleosaurids. The cladogram below follows the preliminary phylogenetic analysis of Smith & Dyke (2008), with the asterisk noting species recently removed from Rhomaleosaurus to their own genera. Restoration Cladistic analyses by Ketchum & Benson, 2010, Benson et al., 2011, Ketchum & Benson, 2011, and various later studies found \\"R.\\" megacephalus to be basal to the clade containing Rhomaleosaurus and Eurycleidus, thus it should be in its own genus as suggested by Smith and Dyke (2008). Following this, the new genus name Atychodracon was erected by Smith in 2015 for \\"R.\\" megacephalus, with the type species being Atychodracon megacephalus. The generic name is derived from Greek Œ±œÑœÖœáŒÆœÇ, atychis, meaning \\"unfortunate\\" in reference to the unfortunate destruction of the holotype during a World War II air bombing in 1940, plus Œ¥œÅŒ¨Œ∫œâŒΩe, drakon, meaning \\"dragon\\" - a common suffix in genus names of various mesozoic reptile groups. Atychodracon has been included on many occasions in various phylogenetic analyses, usually as \\"Rhomaleosaurus\\" megacephalus. In these analyses, the referred LEICS G221.1851 was used to represent the species due to its higher completeness and being the proposed neotype. The referral of this LEICS G221.1851 to Atychodracon is relatively strong, meaning that this should not affect Atychodracon position in the topology. The following two cladograms are simplified after two recent analyses, showing only the relationships within Rhomaleosauridae, and a few basal taxa whose position within the family is highly uncertain.

Although it is towards the East side of Kamchatka, it is on Kamchatka's watershed, with rivers flowing to both the West and East coast.  Description  Karymshina is a volcanic caldera. There is little to see on the ground since due to the volcano's great age (1.2-1.5 Million years), it has been eroded and covered by younger lava flows from other volcanoes. The caldera measures about 25 km x 15 km. The highest point is Mount Tolstyi at 1300m. In the Northwest of the caldera, there is an uplifted block, indicating an abortive eruption since forming. At present, the caldera floor is dry, but in the past it contained a lake that has left a sandstone layer. There are thermal springs, apparently heated by a large magma chamber that is still warm.  Eruptive History  The earliest known eruption occurred about 1.5 million years ago. Although it is difficult to estimate ejecta volume due to erosion and more recent activity covering this eruptions ejecta, an estimate of ejecta volume has been produced by the discoverers, i.e. ~ 825 cubic km. After this eruption, an uplifted block formed. Rhyolite domes have also formed around the rim, about 500-800,000 years ago.

The eastern half of the south wall of the chancel was rebuilt in the second half of the 15th century, and the clearstory was added to the nave. The south porch was added at the same time, but has subsequently been rebuilt. The church was restored in 1863 under the supervision of the architect J. Chatwin. New bells were inserted in the tower. The stonework of the pillars was renewed where it had deteriorated. The nave, aisles and chancel were paved with blue and red Stafford tiles and the heating apparatus was provided by Rimington of Yorkshire. New seating was provided of stained deal. The cornerstone of the new tower was laid by the Bishop of Reading on 20 October 1891. The new tower was dedicated on 15 June 1892. The church was restored in 1902.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded within few minutes of the quake. It started on 26 April 2015 and also involved Nepali ex-servicemen from India's Gurkha Regiments for interface for guidance, relief and rescue. Background The April 2015 Nepal earthquake (or the Himalayan earthquake) occurred at on 25 April with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.8 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (Violent). Its epicenter was approximately east-southeast of Lamjung, Nepal, and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately . It is the most powerful disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal‚ÄìBihar earthquake. The quake killed nearly 8,900 people in Nepal. Mount Everest avalanche The earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 17. The death toll surpassed that of the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche, making it the most lethal day on the mountain. An Indian army mountaineering team recovered the bodies of 19 mountaineers from Everest base camp and rescued at least 61 stranded climbers from Mount Everest. Indian Air Force helicopters reached Mount Everest on the morning of 26 April for rescue operations. Aircraft used The Indian Army sent a major-general to Nepal to oversee the rescue and relief efforts. The Indian Air Force mobilised its * Ilyushin Il-76 * C-130J Hercules (At least two deployed) * C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft (At least four deployed) * Advanced Light Helicopters (At least two deployed) * Mi-17 helicopters for Operation Maitri. Up to eight Mi-17 helicopters are being used for missions such as air-dropping relief materials. Response As Nepal's immediate neighbour, India was the first-responder to the crisis, by providing relief \\"within six to seven hours of the earthquake,\\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi directed immediate dispatch of relief and rescue teams, including medical team, to Nepal. The Indian Foreign Secretary, S. Jaishankar announced that six more National Disaster Response Force teams would be sent to Nepal in the next 48 hours. He also announced that the aircraft sent to Nepal would not just rescue Indians, but citizens of other countries as well. Air India reduced fares on flights bound for Kathmandu from Delhi, Kolkata, Varanasi, and announced that it would also carry relief material on its flights. Timelines * 25 April 2015: By the afternoon, ten teams from India's National Disaster Response Force, totaling 450 personnel and including several search and rescue dogs, had already arrived in Nepal; ten additional Indian Air Force planes soon departed to join them with further aid. In the immediate aftermath of the quake, India sent 43 tons of relief material, including tents and food. * 26 April 2015: Operation Maitri started. The Indian Air Force evacuated over 500 citizens from Nepal late Saturday through Sunday morning, and hundreds more on Sunday.Ten flights were planned for Sunday. These would airlift army forward hospitals, teams of doctors, nurses, and paramedics, engineering task forces, water, food, National Disaster Response Force teams, medical personnel and equipment, blankets and tents.By Sunday's end, India dispatched a further 10 tons of blankets, 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food items and 2 tons of medicines to Kathmandu. Nearly 1,000 National Disaster Response Force personnel were also pressed into service, and a \\"big evacuation\\" of Indian citizens was underway through the road route. The government deployed 35 buses to evacuate stranded Indians in Nepal via two routes - Sonauli and Raxaul - along the Indo-Nepal border. India started issuing goodwill visas to foreigners stranded in Nepal and mobilizing buses and ambulances to bring them to India by road. Indian Railways provided 100,000 (one lakh) bottles of drinking water to be delivered by the Air Force, with arrangements being made to supply 100,000 bottles every day. * 27 April 2015: By Monday morning, the Indian Air Force had evacuated 1935 Indian citizens from Nepal using 12 aircraft sorties.

Background Electric Yerevan had been preceded by previous smaller movements against price hikes on marshrutkas public transportation and a new mandatory pension savings system. Then in June 2015, the Armenian Public Services Regulatory Committee (PSRC) increased the price of electricity for the public. The cost increased by 7 drams (US$0.01) per kilowatt hour, to be effective on August 1, 2015.

Due to being Russia's only ally in the region, Russia invests, trades and lends with Armenia. Russia also holds two military basis within Armenia and Armenia also joined the Collective Security Treaty Organization's Rapid Reaction Force to come to the defense of its members. In 2015 the relations between the two countries turned sour, which stems from Armenia becoming outspoken about Russia due to its increased arm sales to Azerbaijan during the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh War. Also despite joining Russia's Eurasian Economic Union in January 2015, Armenia's economy has stalled and declined. For example during the first half of 2015, Armenia‚Äôs exports to Russia declined by 35% compared with the same period in 2014. Financial transfers from Russia have declined sharply. In August 2015 private remittances from Russia to Armenia underwent a 49% decline by comparison with the same period in 2014, falling from $147.8 to $71.3 million - a trend continued into 2016. The reduction of remittance linked income to Armenia's population has negatively impacted the nations economy by resulting in a decline in retail trade. Russia's economic trouble is a result of Western sanctions imposed because of Moscow's annexations of Crimea and involvement in Ukraine.  Post-Soviet era electricity privatization  Inter RAO is a parastatal company where the Russian government owns 52.68 percent of the company's shares. Inter RAO uses a parallel integrated grid which synchronizes the electric generators across the Caucasus and Central Asia. The connectivity of the grid provides coordination between the electric generators and allows shortfalls in one area to be made up with surpluses from another. While the grid increases the quality and reliability of electricity, it does raise security concerns to nations. Electric Networks of Armenia (ENA) holds an exclusive license to distribute electricity in Armenia, doing so at tariffs approved by Armenia‚Äôs Public Services Regulatory Commission. ENA had been acquired by Russian Inter RAO UES in 2006. ENA justified the acquisition by stating the company had no other way of paying off over $250 million in debt caused by the inefficiencies in Armenia's outdated energy infrastructure. An audit of the company‚Äôs 2013 finances had showed losses of about $94 million, putting the company on the brink of bankruptcy. Concurrently, a 2013 World Bank report stated that the power sector in Armenia was under financed and that even raising tariffs would not cover increasing costs. On the other side, different media, international organizations and reports by RAO UES itself had mentioned corruption and mismanagement within ENA. In this regard, it has been pointed out that the latest hike could be afforded by the middle class but the underlying reasons for protest actually stemmed from a sense of mistrust in the government due to the perceived corruption and mismanagement.

The apolitical nature of the protests allowed maximum engagement from ordinary citizens. Political party members participated as well, however without any organisational involvement from their respective parties. The protestors age ranged from 17 to 35 and majority were part of Armenia's emerging middle class. Majority of protestors could afford the price hikes, however their actions were geared towards how the country is currently run. On 20‚Äì21 June 2015, in the \\"high-voltage rally\\", activists went on a sit- in strike protesting against the price increase. At the end of the rally, a group of civil activists announced another sit-in in a central Yerevan square, which was attended by thousands of people. On 22 June, the activists of the \\"high-voltage rally\\" marched to Baghramyan Avenue, towards the Presidential Palace and began a sit-in protest. On 23 June, early in the morning 200 peaceful protesters were detained from the center of Baghramyan Avenue, many of whom were journalists. Police used water cannons on protesters which send 25 people to the hospital and triggered a larger wave of protests to follow. Protests spread to other Armenian cities like Gyumri, Vanadzor, Martuni, Spitak, and Ashtarak. Police brutality led to protestors blocking central Bagramyan Avenue and barricading themselves with dumpsters. On 27 June, protesters closed the Mashtots Avenue and Sayat-Nova Avenue intersection and the Place de France.

End of protests An independent audit of ENA concluded that the electricity tariff increase was indeed due from a financial point of view. Eventually, the government approved the sale of ENA from RAO UES to the Tashir Group, run by Samvel Karapetyan, a Russia-based Armenian billionaire who had retained close links with Armenia as a philanthropist and is a generally respected figure in Armenia. The Armenian government then announced that they would jointly ‚Äîtogether with the Tashir group‚Äî subsidize the hike until July 31, 2016. Tashir Group acquired ENA for a total of $253 million. Tashir Group pledged to introduce international standards within five years, improve the management of the utility and is also committed to reduce the technological losses of the company by at least 2%. Tashir Group is planning to invest 8.4 billion dram to modernize the nations electricity metering system and another 5.8 billion to repair and construct distributions networks.

His father, John Alexander Selbie, was a minister in the Free Church and later went on to be a professor at Aberdeen United Free College. Selbie was third child of four, having an older brother William Philip, an older sister Jane, and a younger sister Eleanor. He held a B.Sc. degree from the University of Aberdeen, graduating in 1910. Zoological career Selbie took up the position of Assistant Naturalist in the Dublin Museum of Science and Art in 1911. Under the guidance of Robert Francis Scharff, Selbie worked on crustacea and myriapoda, most notably on the specimens from the Fisheries cruiser the Helga and the Clare Island Survey. His ability to illustrate his monographs was a talent that was noted by his contemporaries. He named one crustacea, Palinurus thomsoni, in honour of his former Professor John Arthur Thomson. Military career Selbie enlisted into the 15th Royal Scots Regiment on the outbreak of World War I as a private on 4 November 1914.

Each star in the system has about eighty times the mass of the Sun. It is not clear why this system is located away from the center of the cluster. It is possible that the system was formed in the core, but that it was ejected by dynamical interactions. Every 3.6 days the two stars in this system revolve around each other.

A large nitrogen abundance has been measured on the surface of the stars, about six times the abundance of nitrogen measured in the sun. This nitrogen is probably produced in deeper layers of the star and pushed towards the surface by rotational mixing.

Atwater studied art at the Chicago Art Institute and in Paris, France. She lived in several western states, Bolivia and Mexico. When living in Basin, Montana, she began weaving as an artistic outlet and to provide business opportunities for the women in her community. She organized a weaving guild and published The Shuttle-Craft Book of American Hand-Weaving (Macmillan, 1928). She wrote monographs on specific weave structures as well as an instructional course in hand weaving (Cambridge, 1923). The artistic endeavor of handweaving nearly disappeared in America except for Weaver Rose (William Henry Harrison Rose) and his sister Elsie Maria Babcock Rose in Rhode Island and isolated women in the Appalachian Mountains. Mary Meigs Atwater researched patterns and collected forgotten weaves and through her efforts restored weaving in America as an artistic endeavor. As she states in The Shuttle-Craft Book of American Hand-Weaving , \\"There are actually more hand-looms in operation at the present time than there were at the time of the Revolution when all textiles were woven by hand.\\" \\"The 20th-century revival of American hand-weaving began with a few individuals who rediscovered the old coverlets and the surviving weavers. These interested individuals saw a need to collect the woven pieces and knowledge still around before the coverlets were permanently destroyed and the information lost. They recorded or acquired coverlets and coverlet fragments, as well as written drafts, notebooks, and account books.

It is estimated that these settlers and their descendants (not including Turkish soldiers) now make up about half the population of Northern Cyprus.http://www.politico.eu/article/cyprus-reunification-peace- nicos-anastasiades-mustafa-akinci/ The vast majority of the Turkish settlers were given houses and land that legally belong to Greek Cypriots by the government of Northern Cyprus, who is solely recognised by Turkey.Adrienne Christiansen, Crossing the Green Line: Anti-Settler Sentiment in Cyprus The group is heterogeneous in nature and is composed of various sub-groups, with varying degrees of integration. Mainland Turks are generally considered to be more conservative than the highly secularized Turkish Cypriots, and tend to be more in favor of a two-state Cyprus. However, not all settlers support nationalist policies.  Legal issues  The presence of settlers in the island is one of the thorniest, most controversial issues in the ongoing negotiations to reunify Cyprus. The position of the internationally- recognised, Greek Cypriot-led Republic of Cyprus and Greece, backed by United Nations resolutions, is that the settlement program is completely illegal under international law, as it violates the Fourth Geneva Convention (which prohibits an occupying power from willfully transferring its own population to the occupied area) and is a war crime.Frank Hoffmeister, Legal Aspects of the Cyprus Problem: Annan Plan And EU Accession, pp. 56-59, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2006 The Republic of Cyprus and Greece thus demand that settlers be made to return to Turkey in a possible future solution to the Cyprus dispute; one of the main reasons that Greek Cypriots overwhelmingly rejected the 2004 Annan Plan was that the Annan plan allowed settlers to remain in Cyprus, and even allowed them to vote in the referendum for the proposed solution.Letter by the President of the Republic, Mr Tassos Papadopoulos, to the U.N. Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, dated 7 June, which circulated as an official document of the U.N. Security Council Both the Republic of Cyprus and Greece have therefore demanded that a future Cyprus settlement include the removal of settlers, or at least the greater part of them. Many settlers have severed their ties to Turkey, and their children consider Cyprus to be their homeland. There have been cases where settlers and their children returning to Turkey faced ostracism in their communities of origin. Thus, according to the Encyclopedia of Human Rights, \\"many others\\" argue that the settlers cannot be forcefully expelled from the island; in addition, and most observers think that a comprehensive future Cyprus settlement must \\"balance the overall legality of the settlement program with the human rights of the settlers\\".  Sub-groups  Mainland Turks in Northern Cyprus are divided into two main groups: citizens and non-citizen residents. Within the citizens, some have arrived in the island as a part of a settlement policy run by the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot authorities, some have migrated on their own and some have been born in the island to parents of either groups. Mete Hatay argues that only the first group has \\"good reason to be called settlers\\". The aforementioned sub-groups consist of several categories. The first group, citizens, can further be differentiated into skilled laborers and white-collar workers, Turkish soldiers and their close families, farmers who have settled in Cyprus and individual migrants. The non-citizens can be divided into students and academic staff, tourists, workers with permits and illegitimate workers lacking permits. Farmers settled from Turkey between 1975 and 1977 constitute the majority of the settler population.  History  The policy of settling farmers in Cyprus began immediately after the 1974 invasion. Andrew Borowiec wrote of a Turkish announcement that 5000 agricultural workers would be settled to take up possessions left behind by the displaced Greek Cypriots. According to Hatay, the first group of such settlers arrived on the island in February 1975; heavy settlement continued until 1977. These farmers originated from various regions of Turkey, including the Black Sea Region (Trabzon, √áar≈üamba, Samsun), the Mediterranean Region (Antalya, Adana, Mersin) and the Central Anatolia Region (Konya). In February 1975, the number of \\"workers\\" from Turkey in the island was 910. The policy of settling farmers was conducted along the lines of the Agricultural Workforce Agreement signed by the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus (TFSC) and Turkey in 1975. The consulates of the TFSC in Turkey were actively involved in organizing the transfer of this population; announcements through the radio and muhtars in villages called upon farmers interested in moving to Cyprus to apply to the consulates. Many farmers who moved to Cyprus were from parts of Turkey with harsh living conditions or had to be displaced. This was the case with the village of Kayalar, where people from the Turkish Black Sea district of √áar≈üamba were moved. These people were displaced due to the flooding of their village by a dam that was built, and were given a choice between moving to Cyprus and other regions in Turkey; some chose Cyprus. Christos Ioannides argued that these people had no political motivations for this choice; interviews with some have indicated that some did not know the location of Cyprus before moving there. After the applications of the prospective settlers were approved, they were transported to the port of Mersin in buses specially arranged by the state. They exited Turkey using passports, one of which were issued for every family, and then took the ferry to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Cyprus. Once they arrived in Famagusta, they were initially accommodated briefly in empty hostels or schools, and then transferred to the Greek Cypriot villages, which were their destinations of settlement. The families were assigned houses by lot. The paperwork of these settlers were initially done in a way that would make them appear to be Turkish Cypriots returning to their homeland, to prevent accusations of violation of the Geneva Convention. Once the settlers arrived, Turkish Cypriot officers gathered them in the village coffeehouse, collected their personal information, and the settlers were assigned the closest Turkish Cypriot-inhabited village to their place of residence as their place of birth in their special identity cards that were subsequently produced. For example, a number of settlers in the Karpass Peninsula had the Turkish Cypriot village of Mehmet√ßik as their place of birth. When asked about the policy of settlement, ƒ∞smet Kotak, the Minister of Labor, Rehabilitation and Social Works of the TFSC, said that what was happening was an intense, rightful and legal return of Turkish Cypriots that had been forcefully driven out of the island. However, these special identity cards did not prove effective in achieving their mission and TFSC identity cards showing the settlers' actual place of birth were issued.  Politics  Despite the prevalent assumption that settlers helped maintain the right-wing National Unity Party's (UBP) decades-long power and consecutive electoral victories, this is incorrect, as between 1976 and 1993, the UBP received more votes in native than in settler villages. These trends were determined by the analysis of votes across several native and settler villages by the political scientist Mete Hatay. There was a political movement that was based on the representation of what they saw as the settlers' interests; this line of politics included the New Dawn Party (YDP) and Turkish Union Party (TBP). The majority of the vote in settler villages were divided between these settler parties and mainstream Turkish Cypriot opposition, including the Communal Liberation Party (TKP) and the Republican Turkish Party (CTP). Between 1992, when it was founded, and the election of 2003, which represented a shift away from it, the Democratic Party (DP) received the majority of settler opposition votes. Meanwhile, between 1990 and 2003, the UBP maintained a vote share averaging at around 40% at settler villages, but this was still less than the support it received in rural areas inhabited by native Turkish Cypriots. The UBP only received more support in settler villages in 1993 and after 2003, when it lost power. Furthermore, despite the prevalent assumption that the settlers advance the political interests of Turkey, settlers have voted against the line backed by Turkey at times, notably in 1990 against the Turkey-backed UBP and Rauf Denkta≈ü and in 2004 against the Annan Plan for Cyprus.

It is made with green gram (moong dal) batter, but, unlike dosa, it does not contain urad dal. Pesarattu is eaten as breakfast and as a snack in Andhra Pradesh. It is typically served with ginger or tamarind chutney. Green chilies, ginger and onions are used in variants. MLA pesarattu A variety of pesarattu served with upma is known as MLA pesarattu. It was popular in MLA quarters restaurants in Hyderabad. It was part of the Andhra meals in MLA quarters. Upma pesarattu is a favourite in coastal Andhra region especially the Guntur, Krishna, East Godavari and West Godavari districts. Variations Similar variations are found in North Indian cuisine are moong daal ka cheela or besan ka cheela. In Rajasthan they are commonly known as cheeldo. Preparation Preparation of pesarattu is not difficult but needs to be done with perfection to achieve the desired taste. The first step is soaking the \\"pesalu\\" or whole green gram (a 150 ml cup of gram makes about four medium pesarattus) in water for at least four hours (maximum of seven hours). The soaked gram is then ground to a smooth paste with a couple of green chilies, a small piece of ginger, and some salt. Water is added as required. The mixture is allowed to sit for a few minutes to ensure that the interiors of the grains are fully hydrated. The batter is poured onto a heated pan. If the preparation is meticulous, the pesarattu will slowly start to get crispy over the edges and start to unstick from the pan. In professional cooking facilities, due to high temperatures of the pan, there is usually no need to flip the pesarattu. In domestic settings, the pesarattu is usually flipped, to cook it completely. Chopped onions and chilies are sometimes added to the pesarattu by spreading them over the batter before it becomes a crepe; upma is similarly used. In some places, both upma and onions are added to pesarattu.

Little more than a large earthworks, it was located on The Rim, a neck of land that commands the confluence of the Machias and East Machias Rivers. The earthworks were built in 1776, and attacked by British forces in the 1777 Battle of Machias. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history Machias Bay is located in Down East Maine, and is fed primarily by the Machias River, which flows generally eastward from the town of Machias toward its confluence with the East Machias River, and then southward into the bay. The East Machias River flows generally southward from Hadley Lake, past the village center of East Machias. Shortly before it meets the Machias River, it bends sharply to the east before turning south again to empty into the other river. The landform between this bend and the point of confluence is locally known as \\"The Rim\\". In the 18th century it was recognized for its military value, as it provides a commanding view of the southern stretch of the Machias River and into the bay. Early records of the area's settlement are not clear on when The Rim was first occupied; the area was first settled by Europeans in 1763, and the land was known to have been cleared and in agriculture use by the start of the American Revolutionary War in 1775. Machias was the site of one of the war's first naval encounters, in which a British Navy sloop was captured. After this event, the townspeople decided to fortify The Rim. A breastwork was built there, which was sufficient to repel an attempted landing by British forces in the summer of 1775. In 1776 a more extensive breastwork was built, along with a watch house and barracks, and a log boom was laid across the river just to the south. In August 1777, the British once again arrived in force, and in the second Battle of Machias landed forces on The Rim. Guns mounted at Fort Foster fired on the first ships to arrive, but the fort was abandoned prior to the landing, and its guns were destroyed. After the war The Rim appears to have been abandoned and allowed to become overgrown. In the 1920s it was cleared for blueberry production, and its earthworks, some as much as in height, were still visible then. They have since again become overgrown.

In 2013, the President of the association claimed that dissenting voices were silenced, and called Singh's style \\"feudal and autocratic\\", and two years later, Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences principal Manoj Khanna resigned from his position, also referring to Singh's \\"autocratic\\" attitude. Khanna claimed that colleges were required to submit false affidavits to the All- India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) in order to get approval to run BTech courses, something that was denied by the university's spokesperson. Sing was also accused of financial and administrative irregularities. A ‚ÄòWhite Paper‚Äô released by Delhi University Teachers‚Äô Association (DUTA) alleged financial and administrative irregularities in functioning of Delhi University, like diversion of OBC funds for purchase of laptops or flagging off ‚ÄòGyanodaya Express‚Äô. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, after approval of the President of India (who is also the Visitor of Delhi University) issued a show cause notice to Singh regarding these allegations. Singh responded to the showcause notice denying every charge but HRD ministry turned down his request for withdrawing showcause notice. Noted Academics including ex-President of the Indian National Science Academy, Krishan Lal, former Director General of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, SK Brahmachari, Keki N Daruwallla, ex-Vice President of the Indian Academy of Sciences and a host of academics from JNU, Jamia and Banaras Hindu University and Ex-DU Vice-Chancellor \\"backed\\" Prof. Dinesh Singh raising concern over the manner in which, \\"the autonomy of the university was being compromised\\". The government decided not to process his reply to the showcause notice as he had barely few months left in his tenure and few senior Cabinet ministers pleaded for no action against him in order for him to finish his full term. The HRD ministry, on 7 October 2015, requested the Visitor to send Dinesh Singh on 'forced leave' on the charge that Dinesh Singh tried to derail the process of appointment of his successor. However, the HRD ministry had to withdraw the request as the Visitor Pranab Mukherjee was not convinced if the DU VC should be punished with barely 20 days left of his term. The Visitor asked Dinesh Singh not to continue for a single day beyond the last day of his term. However, Dinesh Singh denied the charge of intentionally derailing the process of appointment of his successor and asserted that he will not continue a day beyond his tenure as is being speculated. In spite of just 20-odd days left for the completion of his term, a large number of teachers and students came out to protest in front of the Vice Regal Lodge demanding his ouster. Not only did the activists of National Democratic Teachers' Front and Academics for Action and Development (Rathi) protest against Dinesh Singh. but the demand for the removal of Dinesh Singh has seen the archrivals Democratic Teachers' Front (DTF) and Academics for Action and Development (AAD) to join anti-VC protests by Delhi University Teachers Association. J Khuntiya, chairman, AAD (Rathi) alleged that the delay has been intentional to ensure that Umesh Rai, a member of the team of Dinesh Singh becomes eligible for selection. One of the names included by Dinesh Singh in the search committee for the selection of new Vice-Chancellor is Vinod Rai. DUTA has also recently charged Singh with plagiarism and has sought investigation into these plagiarism charges against him. Singh was instrumental in initiating Four Year Undergraduate Program (FYUP) which met with a lot of resistance from different quarters, after which the programme was scrapped as per the directives of the University Grant Commission(UGC) . Thereafter, Singh announced his resignation but later retracted it.

Located in West Gouldsboro, this building, designed by Fred L. Savage and built in 1907, is one of the only libraries in Maine built in the Tudor Revival style. It served as a library from 1907 to 1956, and again for a period beginning in 1990. The town's library services are currently provided by the Dorcas Library in Prospect Harbor. This building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Architecture and history The library is set on the east side of Maine State Route 186, about south of its western junction with United States Route 1, and immediately adjacent to the West Gouldsboro Union Church. It is a small single-story Tudor Revival structure, with a tall fieldstone foundation and a stuccoed exterior. It has a side-gable roof with chimneys at the sides, and a front-facing gable that projects slightly at the center of the main facade. The entrance consists of a single door flanked by sidelight windows with diamond lights, with paneling below that matches the door. This is topped by an elliptical hood, above which is the half-timbered gable front. The bays on either side of the entrance have three casement windows with small square panes. The inside consists of a single large room with projecting fireplaces on either side, which are flanked by niches with original bookcases. The ceiling is coved plaster, with a molded plaster frame. The idea for construction of the library supposedly originated in 1904 with the minister of the adjacent church. A social library society was formed, and the land was purchased in 1905. The committee retained noted Bar Harbor architect Fred L. Savage to design the building, which was dedicated in 1907. The library operated until 1956, and was thereafter maintained by the West Gouldsboro Village Improvement Association. The library was reopened in 1990, but has since closed.

She is best known as the author of a diary that gives an account of military life in that era from the viewpoint of the wife of a common soldier. Background Catherine Whitaker was born at Leeds in 1779 and married Joshua Exley there in 1806. Between 1805 and 1815, Joshua served in the Second Battalion of the 34th Regiment of Foot, initially as a private and then for a little over two years, as a corporal. Exley accompanied her husband for a substantial portion of this time and in due course wrote an account that is probably unique in that it records and reflects on life in the British Army from the perspective of the wife of a soldier who did not reach the rank of an officer. The diary Catherine's diary was first published as a booklet issued shortly after her death. A single copy of the booklet is known to exist, it was also reprinted in ‚ÄúThe Dewsbury Reporter‚Äù during August 1923. The text of the diary is included in full in a more recently issued book, edited by Professor Rebecca Probert, along with essays on its military and religious context, the treatment of prisoners of war and the role of women in the British, French and Spanish armed forces during the Peninsular War. The diary unfolds the hardships that both Catherine and her husband suffered during his military service, including one period when they both wrongly thought that the other had died. There are detailed accounts of the births and deaths of children, the cold, hunger and filthy conditions of military life and the horror of the aftermaths of battles. Details of the author's religious experiences which led her to membership of the Methodist church also appear. Exley wrote the diary during the last 20 years before her death, which took place in 1857 at Batley, Yorkshire.

Biography Masudur Rehman Baidya was born in 1968 at Ballabhpur, North 24 Parganas in West Bengal in a Bengali poor family. His father was an imam of a local mosque. At the age of ten, young Masudur lost both his legs in a train mishap. In the year, 1989, at a swimming event organized by the Artificial Limb Centre at Pune, Masudur came first in sixteen out of seventeen competitions. In spite of his physical disabilities, he came fifth on two other events after this. On the first occasion, he swam from Panihati to Ahiritola in the heart of the Ganges river, flowing through Kolkata; and came fifth. He also stood fifth in an eighty-one kilometers long swimming competition organized in the district of Murshidabad in West Bengal. In 1997, he became the first physically handicapped Asian swimmer to successfully cross the English channel. Followed by this, in the year 2001, he became the world's first physically handicapped swimmer to swim across the Strait of Gibraltar. He achieved this feat; by swimming from the Tarifa islands in Spain to shores of Morocco- a total distance of twenty two kilometers- in just about four hours and twenty minutes. In his later life, Masudur was diagnosed with anemia and owing to his limbs becoming increasingly crippled; he died on 26 April 2015 at a hospital in Kolkata, aged 46. Handicap swimmer Masudur Rahman Baidya a double amputee below the knee who won the English Channel, today found a devotee in none other than Indian sporting icon cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. The Indian icon had visited him in December last year while inaugurating Rabindra Swimming Pool and Anushilan Kendra at Lalkuti in Rajarhat. Saluting Masudur's feats, Tendulkar had said: \\"They are the real heroes and their life is like an inspiration to all of us\\" and he was seen inquiring about Baidya's achievements of being the only man with amputated legs to cross the English Channel and Strait of Gibraltar. Masudur's story is more impressive as he showed amazing dedication and perseverance to pursue swimming after being run over by a goods train at an age of ten. He amazed everybody with his strong determination and grit. His body would bend downward from below the waist in the water but he did not give up till he could swim. \\"It is absolutely possible for persons with physical disabilities to do things better than normal people. But you have to be dedicated to your cause,\\" Masudur had said.

Dispute was initiated on September 28, 2008 and was settled on August 16, 2010, with Dispute Settlement Body recognizing European Union's violations. Products at issue Products at issue in the Japan - European Union dispute were IT products such as FDPs (Flat panel display devices), that have digital DVI connectors used for connecting to computers and other equipment; STBCs (set-top boxes) which have a communication function of accessing Internet and recording; and MFMs (multifunctional digital machines), used for scanning, printing, copying, and faxing. History The dispute was initiated by Japan, when it requested consultation with European Communities on September 28, 2008. Issue at hand was tariff treatment of certain information technology products. Japan claimed that tariff treatment was violating commitments of European Union to Information Technology Agreement of WTO. According to Japan, instead of duty-free tariff concessions (provided by ITA), European Union and its member states were imposing duties on certain Japanese technologies. On August 18, 2008, Japan, along with United States and Chinese Taipei jointly requested establishment of a panel. On 21 July 2009, the Chairman of the panel informed the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) that due to complex nature of issue, panel would not be able to complete work in six months from the date of the creation of panel. It was estimated that the panel would issue final report in December 2009, but issuance was postponed several times, with final issuance date of July 2010. On August 16, 2010 panel was concluded and reports were circulated to Members. WTO findings and ruling European Communities have committed to provide duty-free treatment of certain IT products in Information Technology Agreement (ITA). Panel found that measures at issue (tariffs) were not consistent with following Articles: Art. II:1(a) and II:1(b) of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994. The articles require classification of certain FDPs, STBCs and MFMs under dutiable headings although these products fell under HS1996 subheadings which are supposed to be duty-free. Panel concluded that European Communities failed prompt publishing of explanatory notes to enable governments and traders to become acquainted with them. The Panel also found that the European Communities violated Art. X:2 by enforcing the explanatory notes before they were published officially.https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/1pagesum_e/ds376sum_e.pdf After WTO ruling On October 25, 2010, the European Union informed Dispute Settlement Body that it intended to implement recommendations and rulings of the panel. It requested a reasonable period of time. Japan and European Union informed Dispute Settlement Body that the stated time period would be nine months and nine days (ending on 20 June 2011). On 20 July 2011, the European Union stated that it had adopted all measures necessary to follow DSB's rulings in June, although Japan said that it had several concerns about certain measures taken by European union and was not yet in a position to agree to the European Union's claim. In order to come to resolution and reduce scope of procedural disputes, Japan and the European Union had concluded a sequencing agreement.https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds376_e.htm See also *List of WTO dispute settlement cases References World Trade Organization dispute settlement cases Economy of the European Union Foreign trade of Japan ","title":"EC-IT product dispute"},{"id":"46528031","text":"Jefferson Nogueira J√∫nior (born 22 January 1994), simply known as Jefferson, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a midfielder for Turkish club Gaziantep.

In 1967, with funding from the John Hancock Life Insurance Company, Oxford Development partnered with the Arlen Realty and Development Corporation to form the DonArl Partnership and bought 785 acres of mostly swampland in South Florida for $6 million.Aventura Marketing Council: \\"UBS hosts Business Development Committee meeting featuring 'History of Aventura' presentation\\" by Comm. Bob Diamond\\" by Bari Auerbach February 17, 2010 Career Donald Soffer was given the primary responsibility develop the project. Originally named Turnberry, Soffer renamed the site Aventura (Spanish for adventure) and set about to build an upper-class development centered around the Turnberry Country Club with a golf course designed by architect Robert Trent Jones. The project required that he drain the swamps and re-zone the property from residential single family to high-rise development. With the support of then governor, Claude Kirk, the development went ahead. In 1969, Metro-Dade County approved the 23,900 condo unit master plan which included the construction of a fire station, a library, and a causeway to Sunny Isles Beach. They completed the first stage in 1970 and by 1977 had completed the golf course and added another 4,000 units. The venture was very profitable as they purchased land at $5,000 an acre and sold plots for as high as $2 million an acre in 1981. Soffer's father died in 1972 at the age of 63 and Soffer took control of the family interest in DonArl. In 1977, the partnership with Arlen Realty was dissolved over disputes about the quality of construction with Soffer believing Arlen wanted to build too quick and cheap which would harm the brand. They divided the properties and Soffer formed Turnberry Associates out of his share.

It was published by Broadside Books, a division of HarperCollins, and was adapted into both a film and a graphic novel. Origins Schweizer wrote the book using researchers from the Government Accountability Institute (GAI), an institution Schweizer formed with the then- Executive Chairman of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon. The Mercer Family Foundation funded the $2.6 million cost of producing the book with a $1.7 million contribution to the Institute in 2015, which was more than GAI's entire budget for the previous year. Synopsis Hillary Clinton being sworn in as Secretary of State in 2009. Her husband and former U.S. President, Bill Clinton, holds the Bible. Clinton Cash is an investigation of the foreign benefactors of Bill and Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. It investigates alleged connections between Clinton Foundation donors and Hillary Clinton's work at the State Department. The book argues that the Clinton family accepted lavish donations and speaking fees from foreign donors at times when the State Department was considering whether to award large contracts to groups and people affiliated with those donors. One of those donors include Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi, an Ethiopian and Saudi Arabian billionaire businessman. The book has eleven chapters. Some chapters focus on particular transactions or deals, such as the creation of UrAsia Energy and Uranium One in Kazakhstan, and the connection shareholders had and have to the Clintons. Other chapters focus on a broader set of relationships, particularly with regard to Bill Clinton's paid speeches during the years Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, and whether those paying for his speeches had significant business before the State Department. Schweizer dubs the Clintons' blend of government service and private remuneration the \\"Clinton blur\\". Publication The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Fox News were granted exclusive agreements with the book's author to pursue the story lines found in the book. The Times faced considerable criticism for this arrangement from both its readers and from other media outlets. The paper's own public editor, Margaret Sullivan, said the arrangement was \\"troubling\\" and lacked transparency. Salon wrote that Schweizer was not a responsible journalist and that the arrangement showed that right-wing forces were luring the mainstream press into giving attention to gossip and innuendo much as they had during various supposed Clinton controversies of the 1990s. In addition, Media Matters criticized these two newspapers for failing to report in a timely fashion on inaccuracies that had been discovered in the book. Clinton campaign reaction The day the book was published, Hillary Clinton's campaign set up a portal called \\"The Briefing\\" on its official website. The Briefing is designed to rebut the allegations made in Schweizer's book. Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta, wrote: \\"The book has zero evidence to back up its outlandish claims... While we will not be consumed by these kinds of attacks, we will also not let them go unchallenged.\\"Haberman, Maggie. \\"Clinton Team Bolsters Its Defense Ahead of Negative Book's Release\\", The New York Times, May 4, 2015. Accessed: May 6, 2015. Various spokespeople for Hillary and Bill Clinton disputed the book's allegations, e.g. concerning the charges that Clinton was paid for speeches by Irish billionaire Denis O'Brien of Digicel in exchange for help in securing telecommunications contracts in Haiti in 2010. Commercial reception Clinton Cash debuted at number two on the New York Times Best Seller list. In its first week it sold 31,000 copies and was also second on the Nielsen BookScan ranking for adult nonfiction. The book stayed on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover non-fiction for five weeks. A paperback edition of the book released in 2016 made the relevant Times best seller list as well. According to Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard, the book sold approximately 200,000 copies, in hardcover and paperback as of July 2016. Critical reaction and actions taken Writing for The Washington Post, academic and political activist Lawrence Lessig wrote \\"On any fair reading, the pattern of behavior that Schweizer has charged is corruption.\\" James Freeman reviewed the book for The Wall Street Journal, writing that \\"Almost every page of the fascinating Clinton Cash... will be excruciating reading for partisans on both sides of the aisle\\". Ed Pilkington, writing for The Guardian, reported that it was factually correct that \\"large donations to the foundation from the chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, at around the time of the Russian purchase of the company and while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, were never disclosed to the public. The multimillion dollar sums were channeled through a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation, CGSCI, which did not reveal its individual donors.\\" Following publication and in reaction to areas where it said improvements were warranted, the Clinton Foundation said it would put into place some new procedures for better financial reporting and that it would limit some kinds of foreign donations. Pilkington assessed those claims made by the Clinton Foundation as unlikely to put the matter to rest: \\"But with Bill refusing doggedly to give up his speaker engagements ‚Äì 'I gotta pay our bills' ‚Äì and foreign corporations and super-rich individuals still able to donate to the family charity, it looks like this controversy may run and run.\\" Pilkington also described the book as \\"an unrestrained attack on the former president and first lady.\\" Pilkington notes that some of the claims in the book have been proven factually inaccurate. A passage concerning TD Bank and the Keystone XL pipeline was based on a supposed press release already known to be fraudulent. Schweizer claimed that Clinton had played a \\"central role\\" in the decision to approve Rosatom's purchase of Uranium One, but as Pilkington notes, eight other agencies in addition to the State Department made the call to approve the purchase, and no evidence existed that Clinton herself had participated in the discussions. According to Pilkington, Schweizer does not prove corruption on the part of the Clintons, but \\"one of his main contentions ‚Äì that the former president's rates skyrocketed after his wife became secretary of state ‚Äì is correct... pointing to several glaring conflicts of interest.\\" Several weeks after the book's initial publication, HarperCollins and the author made some corrections to the Kindle edition of the book. Schweizer corrected \\"seven or eight\\" passages that were revealed to be inaccurate after the book was released. FactCheck.org found Schweizer's assertion that Clinton, as Secretary of State, could have stopped Russia from buying a company with extensive uranium mining operations in the U.S. to be false, due to Obama's decision on it. PolitiFact found the assertion that Clinton changed her views on a nuclear deal with India in response to donations to her family's foundation to be false. Film adaptation In May 2016, a film adaptation of the book, funded by co-founder of Government Accountability Institute and Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon (CEO of the Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016), was screened at the Cannes Film Festival.Joshua Green, 'Clinton Cash' Has Been Made Into a Movie, Bloomberg Politics (April 28, 2016).Clinton Cash film aims to cause likely Democratic nominee maximum damage, The Guardian (May 12, 2016). Time magazine reported that conservatives were not the intended audience for the film adaptation of the book: \\"Environmentalists. Anti-nuke activists. Gay-rights advocates. Good-government folks. They're all going to find themselves increasingly uncomfortable over claims that the likely Democratic nominee, in the film's words, takes cash from the \\"darkest, worst corners of the world.\\" The film's U.S. premiere was scheduled for July 24, 2016 in Philadelphia (prior to the 2016 Democratic National Convention there) and the film had a limited release in four other major U.S. cities in early August.

The planetary processes in question include geology, hydrology, atmospheric physics, and interactions such as impact cratering, space weathering, and magnetospheric physics in the solar wind, and possibly biology, via astrobiology. Comparison of multiple bodies assists the researcher, if for no other reason than the Earth is far more accessible than any other body. Those distant bodies may then be evaluated in the context of processes already characterized on Earth. Conversely, other bodies (including extrasolar ones) may provide additional examples, edge cases, and counterexamples to earthbound processes; without a greater context, studying these phenomena in relation to Earth alone may result in low sample sizes and observational biases. Background The term \\"comparative planetology\\" was coined by George Gamow, who reasoned that to fully understand our own planet, we must study others. Poldervaart focused on the Moon, stating \\"An adequate picture of this original planet and its development to the present earth is of great significance, is in fact the ultimate goal of geology as the science leading to knowledge and understanding of earth's history.\\" Geology and geochemistry All terrestrial planets (and some satellites, such as the Moon) are essentially composed of silicates wrapped around iron cores. The large outer Solar System moons and Pluto have more ice, and less rock and metal, but still undergo analogous processes. Volcanism Volcanism on Earth is largely lava-based. Other terrestrial planets display volcanic features assumed to be lava-based, evaluated in the context of analogues readily studied on Earth. For example, Jupiter's moon Io displays extant volcanism, including lava flows. These flows were initially inferred to be composed mostly of various forms of molten elemental sulfur, based on analysis of imaging done by the Voyager probes. However, Earth-based infrared studies done in the 1980s and 1990s caused the consensus to shift in favor of a primarily silicate-based model, with sulfur playing a secondary role. Much of the surface of Mars is composed of various basalts considered analogous to Hawaiian basalts, by their spectra and in situ chemical analyses (including Martian meteorites). Mercury and Earth's Moon similarly feature large areas of basalts, formed by ancient volcanic processes. Surfaces in the polar regions show polygonal morphologies, also seen on Earth. In addition to basalt flows, Venus is home to a large number of pancake dome volcanoes created by highly viscous silica-rich lava flows. These domes lack a known Earth analogue. They do bear some morphological resemblance to terrestrial rhyolite-dacite lava domes, although the pancake domes are much flatter and uniformly round in nature. Certain regions further out in the Solar System exhibit cryovolcanism, a process not seen anywhere on earth. Cryovolcanism is studied through laboratory experiments, conceptual and numerical modeling, and by cross-comparison to other examples in the field. Examples of bodies with cryovolcanic features include comets, some asteroids and Centaurs, Mars, Europa, Enceladus, Triton, and possibly Titan, Ceres, Pluto, and Eris. The trace dopants of Europa's ice are currently postulated to contain sulfur. This is being evaluated via a Canadian sulfate spring as an analogue, in preparation for future Europa probes. Small bodies such as comets, some asteroid types, and dust grains, on the other hand, serve as counterexamples. Assumed to have experienced little or no heating, these materials may contain (or be) samples representing the early Solar System, which have since been erased from Earth or any other large body. Some extrasolar planets are covered entirely in lava oceans, and some are tidally locked planets, whose star-facing hemisphere is entirely lava. Cratering The craters observed on the Moon were once assumed to be volcanic. Earth, by comparison, did not show a similar crater count, nor a high frequency of large meteor events, which would be expected as two nearby bodies should experience similar impact rates. Eventually this volcanism model was overturned, as numerous Earth craters (demonstrated by e. g., shatter cones, shocked quartz and other impactites, and possibly spall) were found, after having been eroded over geologic time. Craters formed by larger and larger ordnance also served as models. The Moon, on the other hand, shows no atmosphere or hydrosphere, and could thus accumulate and preserve impact craters over billions of years despite a low impact rate at any one time. In addition, more searches by more groups with better equipment highlighted the great number of asteroids, presumed to have been even more numerous in earlier Solar System periods. As on Earth, a low crater count on other bodies indicates young surfaces. This is particularly credible if nearby regions or bodies show heavier cratering. Young surfaces, in turn, indicate atmospheric, tectonic or volcanic, or hydrological processing on large bodies and comets, or dust redistribution or a relatively recent formation on asteroids (i. e., splitting from a parent body). Examination of the cratering record on multiple bodies, at multiple areas in the Solar System, points to a Late Heavy Bombardment, which in turn gives evidence of the Solar System's early history. However, the Late Heavy Bombardment as currently proposed has some issues and is not completely accepted. One model for Mercury's exceptionally high density compared to other terrestrial planets is the stripping off of a significant amount of crust and/or mantle from extremely heavy bombardment. Differentiation As a large body, Earth can efficiently retain its internal heat (from its initial formation plus decay of its radioisotopes) over the long timescale of the Solar System. It thus retains a molten core, and has differentiated- dense materials have sunk to the core, while light materials float to form a crust. Other bodies, by comparison, may or may not have differentiated, based on their formation history, radioisotope content, further energy input via bombardment, distance from the Sun, size, etc. Studying bodies of various sizes and distances from the Sun provides examples and places constraints on the differentiation process. Differentiation itself is evaluated indirectly, by the mineralogy of a body's surface, versus its expected bulk density and mineralogy, or via shape effects due to slight variations in gravity. Differentiation may also be measured directly, by the higher-order terms of a body's gravity field as measured by a flyby or gravitational assist, and in some cases by librations. Edge cases include Vesta and some of the larger moons, which show differentiation but are assumed to have since fully solidified. The question of whether Earth's Moon has solidified, or retains some molten layers, has not been definitively answered. Additionally, differentiation processes are expected to vary along a continuum. Bodies may be composed of lighter and heavier rocks and metals, a high water ice and volatiles content (with less mechanical strength) in cooler regions of the Solar System, or primarily ices with a low rock/metal content even farther from the Sun. This continuum is thought to record the varying chemistries of the early Solar System, with refractories surviving in warm regions, and volatiles driven outward by the young Sun. The cores of planets are inaccessible, studied indirectly by seismometry, gravimetry, and in some cases magnetometry. However, iron and stony-iron meteorites are likely fragments from the cores of parent bodies which have partially or completely differentiated, then shattered. These meteorites are thus the only means of directly examining deep-interior materials and their processes. Gas giant planets represent another form of differentiation, with multiple fluid layers by density. Some distinguish further between true gas giants, and ice giants further from the Sun. Tectonics In turn, a molten core may allow plate tectonics, of which Earth shows major features. Mars, as a smaller body than Earth, shows no current tectonic activity, nor mountain ridges from geologically recent activity. This is assumed to be due to an interior that has cooled faster than the Earth (see geomagnetism below). An edge case may be Venus, which does not appear to have extant tectonics. However, in its history, it likely has had tectonic activity but lost it. It is possible tectonic activity on Venus may still be sufficient to restart after a long era of accumulation. Io, despite having high volcanism, does not show any tectonic activity, possibly due to sulfur-based magmas with higher temperatures, or simply higher volumetric fluxes. Meanwhile, Vesta's fossae may be considered a form of tectonics, despite that body's small size and cool temperatures. Europa is a key demonstration of outer-planet tectonics. Its surface shows movement of ice blocks or rafts, strike-slip faults, and possibly diapirs. The question of extant tectonics is far less certain, possibly having been replaced by local cryomagmatism. Ganymede and Triton may contain tectonically or cryovolcanically resurfaced areas, and Miranda's irregular terrains may be tectonic. Earthquakes are well-studied on Earth, as multiple seismometers or large arrays can be used to derive quake waveforms in multiple dimensions. The Moon is the only other body to successfully receive a seismometer array; \\"marsquakes\\" and the mars interior are based on simple models and Earth- derived assumptions. Venus has received negligible seismometry. Gas giants may in turn show different forms of heat transfer and mixing. Furthermore, gas giants show different heat effects by size and distance to the Sun. Uranus shows a net negative heat budget to space, but the others (including Neptune, farther out) are net positive. Geomagnetism Two terrestrial planets (Earth and Mercury) display magnetospheres, and thus have molten metal layers. Similarly, all four gas giants have magnetospheres, which indicate layers of conductive fluids. Ganymede also shows a weak magnetosphere, taken as evidence of a subsurface layer of salt water, while the volume around Rhea shows symmetrical effects which may be rings or a magnetic phenomenon. Of these, Earth's magnetosphere is by far the most accessible, including from the surface. It is therefore the most studied, and extraterrestrial magnetospheres are examined in light of prior Earth studies. Still, differences exist between magnetospheres, pointing to areas needing further research. Jupiter's magnetosphere is stronger than the other gas giants, while Earth's is stronger than Mercury's. Mercury and Uranus have offset magnetospheres, which have no satisfactory explanation yet. Uranus' tipped axis causes its magnetotail to corkscrew behind the planet, with no known analogue. Future Uranian studies may show new magnetospheric phenomena. Mars shows remnants of an earlier, planetary-scale magnetic field, with stripes as on Earth. This is taken as evidence that the planet had a molten metal core in its prior history, allowing both a magnetosphere and tectonic activity (as on Earth). Both of these have since dissipated. Earth's Moon shows localized magnetic fields, indicating some process other than a large, molten metal core. This may be the source of lunar swirls, not seen on Earth. Geochemistry Apart from their distance to the Sun, different bodies show chemical variations indicating their formation and history. Neptune is denser than Uranus, taken as one piece of evidence that the two may have switched places in the early Solar System. Comets show both high volatile content, and grains containing refractory materials. This also indicates some mixing of materials through the Solar System when those comets formed. Mercury's inventory of materials by volatility is being used to evaluate different models for its formation and/or subsequent modification. Isotopic abundances indicate processes over the history of the Solar System. To an extent, all bodies formed from the presolar nebula. Various subsequent processes then alter elemental and isotopic ratios. The gas giants in particular have enough gravity to retain primary atmospheres, taken largely from the presolar nebula, as opposed to the later outgassing and reactions of secondary atmospheres. Differences in gas giant atmospheres compared to solar abundances then indicate some process in that planet's history. Meanwhile, gases at small planets such as Venus and Mars have isotopic differences indicating atmospheric escape processes.{argon isotope ratio planet meteorite}{neon isotope ratio meteorite} The various modifications of surface minerals, or space weathering, is used to evaluate meteorite and asteroid types and ages. Rocks and metals shielded by atmospheres (particularly thick ones), or other minerals, experience less weathering and fewer implantation chemistries and cosmic ray tracks. Asteroids are currently graded by their spectra, indicating surface properties and mineralogies. Some asteroids appear to have less space weathering, by various processes including a relatively recent formation date or a \\"freshening\\" event. As Earth's minerals are well shielded, space weathering is studied via extraterrestrial bodies, and preferably multiple examples. Kuiper Belt Objects display very weathered or in some cases very fresh surfaces. As the long distances result in low spatial and spectral resolutions, KBO surface chemistries are currently evaluated via analogous moons and asteroids closer to Earth. Aeronomy and atmospheric physics Earth's atmosphere is far thicker than that of Mars, while far thinner than Venus'. In turn, the envelopes of gas giants are a different class entirely, and show their own gradations. Meanwhile, smaller bodies show tenuous atmospheres (\\"surface-bound exospheres\\"), with the exception of Titan and arguably Triton. Comets vary between negligible atmospheres in the outer solar system, and active comas millions of miles across at perihelion. Exoplanets may in turn possess atmospheric properties known and unknown in our star system. Aeronomy Atmospheric escape is largely a thermal process. The atmosphere a body can retain therefore varies from the warmer inner Solar System, to the cooler outer regions. Different bodies in different Solar System regions provide analogous or contrasting examples. The atmosphere of Titan is considered analogous to an early, colder Earth; the atmosphere of Pluto is considered analogous to an enormous comet. The presence or absence of a magnetic field affects an upper atmosphere, and in turn the overall atmosphere. Impacts of solar wind particles create chemical reactions and ionic species, which may in turn affect magnetospheric phenomena. Earth serves as a counterexample to Venus and Mars, which have no planetary magnetospheres, and to Mercury, with a magnetosphere but negligible atmosphere. Jupiter's moon Io creates sulfur emissions, and a feature of sulfur and some sodium around that planet. Similarly, Earth's Moon has trace sodium emissions, and a far weaker tail. Mercury also has a trace sodium atmosphere. Jupiter itself is assumed to have some characteristics of extrasolar \\"super Jupiters\\" and brown dwarves. Seasons Uranus, tipped on its side, is postulated to have seasonal effects far stronger than on Earth. Similarly, Mars is postulated to have varied its axial tilt over eons, and to a far greater extent than on Earth. This is hypothesized to have dramatically altered not only seasons but climates on Mars, for which some evidence has been observed. Venus has negligible tilt, eliminating seasons, and a slow, retrograde rotation, causing different diurnal effects than on Earth and Mars. Clouds and haze layers From Earth, a planetwide cloud layer is the dominant feature of Venus in the visible spectrum; this is also true of Titan. Venus' cloud layer is composed of sulfur dioxide particles, while Titan's is a mixture of organics. The gas giant planets display clouds or belts of various compositions, including ammonia and methane. Circulation and winds Venus and Titan, and to a lesser extent Earth, are superrotators- the atmosphere turns about the planet faster than the surface beneath. While these atmospheres share physical processes, they exhibit diverse characteristics. Hadley cells, first postulated and confirmed on Earth, are seen in different forms in other atmospheres. Earth has Hadley cells north and south of its equator, leading to additional cells by latitude. Mars' Hadley circulation is offset from its equator. Titan, a far smaller body, likely has one enormous cell, flipping polarity from northerly to southerly with its seasons. The bands of Jupiter are thought to be numerous Hadley-like cells by latitude. Storms and cyclonic activity The large storms seen on the gas giants are considered analogous to Earth cyclones. However, this is an imperfect metaphor as expected, due to the large differences in sizes, temperature, and composition between Earth and the gas giants, and even between gas giants. Polar vortices were observed on Venus and Saturn. In turn, Earth's thinner atmosphere shows weaker polar vorticity and effects. Lightning and aurorae Both lightning and aurorae have been observed on other bodies after extensive study at Earth. Lightning has been detected on Venus, and may be a sign of active volcanism on that planet, as volcanic lightning is known on Earth. Aurorae have been observed on Jupiter and its moon Ganymede. Comparative climatology An understanding of the evolutionary histories and current states of the Venus and Mars climates is directly relevant for studies of the past, present and future climates of Earth. Hydrology A growing number of bodies display relict or current hydrological modification. Earth, the \\"ocean planet,\\" is the prime example. Other bodies display lesser modifications, indicating their similarities and differences. This may be defined to include fluids other than water, such as light hydrocarbons on Titan, or possibly supercritical carbon dioxide on Mars, which do not persist in Earth conditions. Ancient lava flows in turn may be considered a form of hydrological modification, which may be confounded with other fluids. Io currently has lava calderas and lakes. Fluid modification may have occurred on bodies as small as Vesta; hydration in general has been observed. If fluids include groundwater and vapor, the list of bodies with hydrological modification includes Earth, Mars, and Enceladus, to a lesser extent comets and some asteroids, likely Europa and Triton, and possibly Ceres, Titan, and Pluto. Venus may have had hydrology in its early history, which would since have been erased. Fluid modification and mineral deposition on Mars, as observed by the MER and MSL rovers, is studied in light of Earth features and minerals. Minerals observed from orbiters and landers indicates formation in aqueous conditions; morphologies indicate fluid action and deposition. Extant Mars hydrology includes brief, seasonal flows on slopes; however, most Martian water is frozen into its polar caps and subsurface, as indicated by ground penetrating radars and pedestal craters. Antifreeze mixtures such as salts, peroxides, and perchlorates may allow fluid flow at Martian temperatures. Analogues of Mars landforms on Earth include Siberian and Hawaiian valleys, Greenland slopes, the Columbian Plateau, and various playas. Analogues for human expeditions (e.g. geology and hydrology fieldwork) include Devon Island, Canada, Antarctica, Utah, the Euro-Mars project, and Arkaroola, South Australia. The Moon, on the other hand, is a natural laboratory for regolith processes and weathering on anhydrous airless bodies- modification and alteration by meteoroid and micrometeoroid impacts, the implantation of solar and interstellar charged particles, radiation damage, spallation, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and so on. Knowledge of the processes that create and modify the lunar regolith is essential to understanding the compositional and structural attributes of other airless planet and asteroid regoliths. Other possibilities include extrasolar planets completely covered by oceans, which would lack some Earthly processes. Dynamics Earth, alone among terrestrial planets, possesses a large moon. This is thought to confer stability to Earth's axial tilt, and thus seasons and climates. The closest analogue is the Pluto-Charon system, though its axial tilt is completely different. Both our Moon and Charon are hypothesized to have formed via giant impacts. Giant impacts are hypothesized to account for both the tilt of Uranus, and the retrograde rotation of Venus. Giant impacts are also candidates for the Mars ocean hypothesis, and the high density of Mercury. Most giant planets (except Neptune) have retinues of moons, rings, ring shepherds, and moon Trojans analogous to mini-solar systems. These systems are postulated to have accreted from analogous gas clouds, and possibly with analogous migrations during their formation periods. The Cassini mission was defended on the grounds that Saturn system dynamics would contribute to studies of Solar System dynamics and formation. Studies of ring systems inform us of many-body dynamics. This is applicable to the asteroid and Kuiper Belts, and the early Solar System, which had more objects, dust, and gas. It is relevant to the magnetospherics of those bodies. It is also relevant to the dynamics of our galaxy and others. In turn, though the Saturnian system is readily studied (by Cassini, ground telescopes, and space telescopes), the simpler and lower mass ring systems of the other giants makes their explanations somewhat easier to fathom. The Jupiter ring system is perhaps more completely understood at present than any of the other three. Asteroid families and gaps indicate their local dynamics. They are in turn indicative of the Kuiper Belt, and its hypothesized Kuiper cliff. The Hildas and Jupiter Trojans are then relevant to the Neptune Trojans and Plutinos, Twotinos, etc. Neptune's relative lack of a moon system suggests its formation and dynamics. The migration of Triton explains the ejection or destruction of competing moons, analogous to Hot Jupiters (also in sparse systems), and the Grand Tack hypothesis of Jupiter itself, on a smaller scale. The planets are considered to have formed by accretion of larger and larger particles, into asteroids and planetesimals, and into today's bodies. Vesta and Ceres are hypothesized to be the only surviving examples of planetesimals, and thus samples of the formative period of the Solar System. Transits of Mercury and Venus have been observed as analogues of extrasolar transits. As Mercury and Venus transits are far closer and thus appear \\"deeper,\\" they can be studied in far finer detail. Similarly, analogues to our asteroid and Kuiper belts have been observed around other star systems, though in far less detail. Astrobiology Earth is the only body known to contain life; this results in geologic and atmospheric life signatures apart from the organisms themselves. Methane observed on Mars has been postulated but cannot be definitively ascribed as a biosignature. Multiple processes of non-biological methane generation are seen on Earth as well. The detection of biomarkers or biosignatures on other worlds is an active area of research. Although oxygen and/or ozone are generally considered strong signs of life, these too have alternate, non-biological explanations. The Galileo mission, while performing a gravity assist flyby of Earth, treated our planet as an extraterrestrial one, in a test of life detection techniques. Conversely, the Deep Impact mission's High Resolution Imager, intended for examining comets starting from great distances, could be repurposed for exoplanet observations in its EPOXI extended mission. Conversely, detection of life entails identification of those processes favoring or preventing life. This occurs primarily via study of Earth life and Earth processes, though this is in effect a sample size of one. Care must be taken to avoid observation and selection biases. Astrobiologists consider alternative chemistries for life, and study on Earth extremophile organisms that expand the potential definitions of habitable worlds.

During this time the warrior told the King of his homeland. \\"I come,\\" he said, \\"from a country where there is nothing but truth, and where there is neither age nor withering away, nor heaviness, nor sadness, nor jealousy, nor envy, nor pride.\\" Cormac delighted in this and the two avowed friendship, but not before the King asked for the warrior's silver branch as a token of the bond between them. The man accepted and gave the branch to the King, but on the condition that he in turn must be granted three wishes ‚Äì a bargain that Cormac is quick to accept. That being done, the mysterious warrior left Tara as quickly and as quietly as he had come. As to the silver branch, \\"'delight and amusement to the full was it to listen to the music of that branch, for men sore wounded, or women in child- bed, or folk in sickness, would fall asleep at the melody when that branch was shaken.'\\" In short, it's music ‚Äì haunting and beautiful ‚Äì provided sleep and healing and the King used it for both healing and entertaining his court. A year passed before the mysterious warrior returned quite suddenly and with no forward warning. \\"I have come so that you may grant me my first wish,\\" he said in grave and ominous tones. The King, though nervous, promised to grant it. \\"Give me your daughter!\\" the warrior demanded, and as Cormac handed Aille, his bright and only daughter, to him, they both vanished in a swirl of mist. \\"So he brought away the girl with him, and the women of Ireland gave three loud cries after the king's daughter. But Cormac shook the branch at them, until it put away sorrow from them, and put them all into their sleep\\". A month later the warrior returned and, in like manner, demanded King Cormac's only son, Carpre Lifeca; then, several days later, returned to have his third and final wish fulfilled, that being Ethne, Cormac's wife and Queen. This was too much for Cormac, and so the grief-stricken King mustered and marched forth with a great host from Tara, his intention being to find and rescue his family. What he found, and his manner of finding it, was not what he expected however. For \\"in the middle of the Plain of the Wall, a thick mist came on them, and when it was gone, Cormac found himself alone on a great plain. And he saw a great dun in the middle of the plain, with a wall of bronze around it, and in the dun a house of white silver, and it half thatched with the white wings of birds. And there was a great troop of the Riders of the Sidhe all about the house, and their arms full of white bird's wings for thatching. But as soon as they would put on the thatch, a blast of wind would come and carry it away again\\". Then he saw a man kindling a fire, and he used to throw a thick oak- tree upon it. And when he would come back with a second tree, the first one would be burned out. \\"I will be looking at you no longer,\\" Cormac said then, \\"for there is no one here to tell me your story, and I think I could find good sense in your meanings if I understood them,\\" he said. Then he went on to where there was another dun, very large and royal, and another wall of bronze around it, and four houses within it. And he went in and saw a great king's house, having beams of bronze and walls of silver, and its thatch of the wings of white birds. And then he saw on the green a shining well, and five streams flowing from it, and the armies drinking water in turn, and the nine lasting purple hazels of Buan growing over it. And they were dropping their nuts into the water, and the five salmon would catch them and send their husks floating down the streams. And the sound of the flowing of those streams is sweeter than any music that men sing. Cormac then entered the mystical palace, finding there waiting for him a man and a woman, very tall, and having clothes of many hues. The man was beautiful as to shape, and his face wonderful to look at; and as to the young woman that was with him, she was the loveliest of all the women of the world, and she having yellow hair and a golden helmet. And there was a bath there, and heated stones going in and out of the water of themselves, and Cormac bathed himself in it. \\"Rise up, man of the house,\\" the woman called out upon the end of his bath, \\"for this is a comely traveler is come to us; and if you have one kind of food or meat better than another, let it be brought in.\\" The man rose up then and he said: \\"I have but seven pigs, but I could feed the whole world with them, for the pig that is killed and eaten to-day, you will find it alive again to-morrow.\\" Then entered another man, this one bearing an axe in his right hand and a log in his left with a pig following behind him. \\"It is time to make ready,\\" said the man of the house, \\"for we have a high guest with us to-day.\\" Then the man struck the pig and killed it, and he cut the logs and made a fire and put the pig on it in a cauldron. \\"It is time for you to turn it,\\" said the master of the house after a while. \\"There would be no use doing that,\\" said the man, \\"for never and never will the pig be boiled until a truth is told for every quarter of it.\\" \\"Then let you tell yours first,\\" said the master of the house. \\"One day,\\" said the man, \\"I found another man's cows in my land, and I brought them with me into a cattle pound. The owner of the cows followed me, and he said he would give me a reward to let the cows go free. So I gave them back to him, and he gave me an axe, and when a pig is to be killed, it is with the axe it is killed, and the log is cut with it, and there is enough wood to boil the pig, and enough for the palace besides. And that is not all, for the log is found whole again in the morning. And from that time till now, that is the way they are.\\" \\"It is true indeed that story is,\\" said the man of the house. They turned the pig in the cauldron then, and but one quarter of it was found to be cooked. \\"Let us tell another true story,\\" they said. \\"I will tell one,\\" said the master of the house. \\"Ploughing time had come, and when we had a mind to plough that field outside, it is the way we found it, ploughed, and harrowed, and sowed with wheat. When we had a mind to reap it, the wheat was found in the haggard, all in one thatched rick. We have been using it from that day to this, and it is no bigger and no less.\\" Then they turned the pig, and another quarter was found to be ready. \\"It is my turn now,\\" said the woman. \\"I have seven cows,\\" she said, \\"and seven sheep. And the milk of the seven cows would satisfy the whole of the men of the world, if they were in the plain drinking it, and it is enough for all the people of the Land of Promise, and it is from the wool of the seven sheep all the clothes they wear are made.\\" And at that story the third quarter of the pig was boiled. \\"If these stories are true,\\" said Cormac to the man of the house, \\"you are Manannan, and this is Manannan's wife; for no one on the whole ridge of the world owns these treasures but himself. It was to the Land of Promise he went to look for that woman, and he got those seven cows with her.\\" They said to Cormac that it was his turn now. So Cormac told them how his wife, and his son, and his daughter, had been brought away from him, and how he himself had followed them till he came to that place. And with that the whole pig was boiled, and they cut it up, and Cormac's share was put before him. \\"I never used a meal yet,\\" said he, \\"having two persons only in my company.\\" The man of the house began singing to him then, and put him asleep. And when he awoke, he saw fifty armed men, and his son, and his wife, and his daughter, along with them. There was great gladness and courage on him then, and ale and food were given out to them all. And there was a gold cup put in the hand of the master of the house, and Cormac was wondering at it, for the number of the shapes on it, and for the strangeness of the work. \\"There is a stranger thing yet about it,\\" the man said; \\"let three lying words be spoken under it, and it will break into three, and then let three true words be spoken under it, and it will be as good as before.\\" So he said three lying words under it, and it broke in three pieces. \\"It is best to speak truth now under it,\\" he said, \\"and to mend it. And I give my word, Cormac,\\" he said, \\"that until to-day neither your wife or your daughter has seen the face of a man since they were brought away from you out of Teamhair, and that your son has never seen the face of a woman.\\" And with that the cup was whole again on the moment. \\"Bring away your wife and your children with you now,\\" he said, \\"and this cup along with them, the way you will have it for judging between truth and untruth. And I will leave the branch with you for music and delight, but on the day of your death they will be taken from you again.\\" \\"And I myself,\\" he said, \\"am Manannan, son of Lir, King of T√≠r na n√ìg, and I brought you here by enchantments that you might be with me to-night in friendship. \\"And the Riders you saw thatching the house,\\" he said, \\"are the men of art and poets, and all that look for a fortune in Ireland, putting together cattle and riches. For when they go out, all that they leave in their houses goes to nothing, and so they go on for ever. \\"And the man you saw kindling the fire,\\" he said, \\"is a young lord that is more liberal than he can afford, and every one else is served while he is getting the feast ready, and every one else profiting by it. \\"And the well you saw is the Well of Knowledge, and the streams are the five streams through which all knowledge goes. And no one will have knowledge who does not drink a draught out of the well itself or out of the streams. And the people of many arts are those who drink from them all.\\" And on the morning of the morrow, when Cormac rose up, he found himself on the green of Teamhair, and his wife, and his son, and his daughter, along with him, and he having his branch and his cup. And it was given the name of Cormac's Cup, and it used to judge between truth and falsehood among the Gael. But it was not left in Ireland after the night of Cormac's death, as Manannan had foretold him.

Cai served for many years in Fujian province, and was known to have deep knowledge of the military situation in Taiwan. In 1996, when then Central Military Commission vice chairman Zhang Wannian was dispatched to the Nanjing Military Region to oversee military maneuvers in the Taiwan Strait, Cai became his secretary. He was also named deputy director of the General Office of the Central Military Commission. In 2002, Cai returned to the Nanjing MR to serve as deputy chief of staff. In 2011 he was recalled to Beijing to serve as Deputy Chief of the General Staff, the youngest officer of Military Region-level at the time. Cai served as Deputy Chief of the General Staff from 2011 until 2012. In 2012, Cai made a visit to the United States, including a stop at the U.S. military base at Fort Hood, Texas, and at Pearl Harbor. The visit led to speculation that he was due for further promotion, perhaps to the position of executive deputy chief of general staff. Later that year, Cai was appointed Commander of the Nanjing Military Region. He attained the rank of general (shang jiang) in July 2013 and was a full member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Cai was once seen as a rising star and one of the most trusted allies in the military of Chairman Xi Jinping. He had served as Commander of the Xiamen-based 31st Group Army of the Nanjing Military Region, considered Xi's \\"royal army\\". Several of his former deputies in the Nanjing MR, including Gen. Song Puxuan, Gen. Wang Jiaocheng, and Lt. Gen. Qin Weijiang, were promoted to higher positions. Retirement In January 2017, Cai retired from his post as President of the PLA Academy of Military Science and was not known to have taken on any other post. Cai's departure was unusual, as he had not yet reached the PLA‚Äôs mandatory retirement age for his rank. In May 2018, the South China Morning Post reported that Cai had been demoted by eight grades, possibly because he had failed to report his daughter's marriage to a Frenchman, and because of his ties to disgraced senior commanders.

A native of Tennessee, he spent much of his career in South Carolina. Scarborough was born in Dover, Tennessee to John and Sally Bosworth Scarborough, whose family origins were in Scarborough, Yorkshire. He often employed a family coat of arms dating back to the Wars of the Roses; one art historian noted that he \\"sealed his letters with a white rose as a memento of the sympathies of his family in days gone by.\\" His father allowed him to travel on an educational trip when he was 16; the only paintings he had seen up until that point were those in the local tavern. Around 1828 he began the study of medicine in Cincinnati, but soon decided to become an artist instead, and he is known to have worked with Horace Harding and Henry Inman in that city. He may also have come to know Dr. Daniel Drake at the same time. He underwent more thorough training in Nashville under the tutelage of John C. Grimes in 1830. He is also known to have studied and worked in Florence, Tuscumbia, Cortland, and Athens, Alabama; Kingston, Rogersville, and Knoxville, Tennessee; and Georgia. In 1838 he is recorded as working in Lynchburg, Virginia. Scarborough married Sarah Ann Gaines in Dover on October 8, 1833. She died in childbirth on March 29, 1835, and he and his infant son John left Tennessee for Alabama, before settling in Charleston, South Carolina in 1836. It was in Charleston that he was provided with his first commissions when planter and lawyer John Miller asked him to paint some of his seven daughters; the artist married one of the seven, Miranda Eliza, on November 28, 1838, and the couple lived with her parents for a time before moving. Scarborough had opened a studio in Cheraw, South Carolina in 1836, and his father-in-law's connections soon ensured a steady stream of patronage there from families such as the DuBoses, Murrells, Furmans, and Lides. This dried up by 1843, and the artist and his wife relocated to Columbia, where he would remain for the rest of his life. Scarborough soon became the preeminent portrait painter in Columbia. Barely a year after he arrived in the city, he received his most important commission to date when he was requested by the Committee of the Clariosophic Society of South Carolina College to paint John C. Calhoun; so successful was the portrait that it was requisitioned by Calhoun's son Andrew, and the Society was forced to commission another for its quarters. Other sitters included James Chesnut and Wade Hampton. He continued traveling, visiting Charleston and Nashville on business and touring Europe, stopping in London, Paris, and Rome, in 1857. He is known to have produced portrait miniatures during his career as well, although few are extant; a pair are currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He also kept meticulous account books, listing his sitters and the proceeds he received from his work. Prices for his paintings could reach upwards of $100. He is said to have worked rapidly, alternating between portraits during the day and often finishing two in a week; he seldom signed his pictures. Scarborough continued painting to the end of his life; at his death he had completed over 230 portraits and left an estate valued at $20,000, a substantial sum for the period. He was initially interred in the churchyard of Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, but was removed some years later when his wife went to live with a daughter in Ridge Spring. She had him reinterred in the Ridge Spring Cemetery, intending to be buried by his side after her death; ironically, she died on a visit to her son in Morrilton, Arkansas, and was buried there instead. Portraits by Scarborough today are found in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morris Museum of Art, the Gibbes Museum of Art, the Columbia Museum of Art, and the University of South Carolina, among other institutions. Wofford College owns a pen-and-ink drawing of Benjamin Wofford, the school's founder. A self-portrait is held by the Florence Museum in Florence, South Carolina. The Columbia Museum of Art also holds a landscape painting by the artist, depicting the falls of the Reedy River in Greenville, South Carolina and dating to a sojourn in that town in 1840; a handful of other landscapes and still-life paintings have been identified, but the vast majority of his output is in the field of portraiture.

It was released for Android and iOS (iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad) on June 7, 2013. It is the sixth (seventh counting Gangstar City) installment in the Gangstar series; it is preceded by Gangstar Rio: City of Saints and succeeded by Gangstar: New Orleans. Gangstar Vegas is set in modern-day Las Vegas, Nevada. The story revolves around Jason Malone, a skilled mixed martial arts fighter who is targeted by Frank Veliano after winning in a match. Like games in the Grand Theft Auto series, Gangstar Vegas has elements of driving games and third-person shooters, and features \\"open-world\\" gameplay that gives the player more control over their playing experience. Upon its release, it received mixed reviews from critics and players alike, who criticized the laggy graphics, animation, and the frequent software updates, but praised the music and the extensive use of three- dimensional (3D) graphics, which some players noted as an improvement over the previous main installment's 3D version. It has also been a commercial success, having been downloaded over 100 million times on Android and iOS. Gameplay Gangstar Vegas is a third-person open-world action-adventure video game; the graphical perspective is capable of being panned. The game world may be traversed on foot or by vehicle. It is structured similarly to previous games in the series and by extension, to Grand Theft Auto and its numerous \\"clones\\". Pedestrians can be killed, primarily in order for the player to get collectibles, and vehicles can be destroyed. The overall game world is much larger, with Gameloft marketing it as \\"Gangstar's largest open world\\". In addition to the main story missions, players can freely roam and/or partake in several side-activities like gang wars, bank robberies, street racing and underground fighting tournaments. Property management is also present, allowing the player to gain income through businesses acquired during the course of the game. In keeping with the game's Las Vegas theme, casino minigames such as video poker, blackjack and slot machines were also introduced, along with several establishments such as a nightclub and convenience stores. There are over 80 missions consisting of action, shooting, racing, and thefts. The player can join \\"parties\\" in the gang wars with flamethrowers, Molotov cocktails, grenade launchers, and many more lethal weapons. Additional content A number of software updates were added to Gangstar Vegas after its initial release, among them a Saints Row-esque Gangstar vs. Aliens pack, and a Christmas-themed update adding new clothing and vehicles such as a rocket-powered sleigh. Also, the game has since been released as a free-to-play title, with bonus content available through microtransactions. Its frequent use of updating also received criticism from some fans and critics, who noted the lack of weapons, vehicles, and costumes, and the laggy graphics. Plot Professional MMA fighter Jason \\"the Kid\\" Malone is bribed by the powerful Mafia boss Don Frank Veliano to take a dive in a match against Pietro Holston. Frank told Jason to fall in the fourth round but Pietro falls before Jason can take the dive. As a result, he is chased by Frank and his henchmen before Karen Olsen, the accountant and bodyguard of Vera \\"Leatherface\\" Montello, arrives and helps him escape. Jason later works for the Montello queenpin, Karen and Eric (more commonly known as \\"E-Man\\"), a pimp and drug maker-dealer, mostly in causing chaos against the Velianos. Frank and his henchmen later storm Montello's celebration, capturing Jason and forcing him to work for the Velianos, including Benny, Frank's right-hand man, and mayoral candidate Rev. Winston \\"Preacher\\" Goodman. Jason steals a boat, a seaplane and a helicopter for the Velianos, alongside fighting the Huevos, a Hispanic street gang. After crashing the Huevos' party, however, Jason finds out that the Velianos have kidnapped Karen and are forcing Vera to hand over her strip club, Fire and Vice, to Frank in exchange for Karen. Jason helps the Montellos save Karen by stealing wire-tapping devices from a military base and planting it to pinpoint Frank and Karen's position. He later joins Eric and Vera to raid Frank's casino, where Karen is held. They then rescue her and escape Frank's soldiers, but at the cost of Vera sacrificing herself to stop reinforcements, out of remorse for having bribed Pietro to lose the MMA fight. Enraged by Vera's loss, and the truth that Frank ordered her father's murder, Karen wants Jason out of the Mafia war. Jason saves her again from Veliano, convincing her to accept his help. Karen kisses Jason (it is also possible they make out in Jason's Whiptail, as the scene is faded out) before reclaiming Fire and Vice. Jason later sabotages Frank's villa, and uses the media (the only business in Vegas not controlled by Veliano) to mock the LVPD's incompetence (Frank has also bribed the police). Finding that Benny has been arrested, Frank seeks to remove him from his system. Jason rescues Benny as Veliano's mob intercepts the police convoy. Benny has photos of Goodman's debauchery, who is then threatened by Jason in order to make the mayoral candidate turn against Frank, otherwise the photos are leaked. Cornered and betrayed, and with the FBI on his tail, Frank tries to flee Las Vegas with his money. Jason confronts him on the Wrecking Ball Hotel Casino Tower (a parody of Stratosphere Las Vegas) with a helicopter, only to have Frank shoot at him, leaking the helicopter's fuel tank in the process. Jason defeats Frank in a fistfight, but the latter pushes the trolley of money onto him, almost making him fall off the building. Jason lights up the petrol and throws it onto Frank, setting the fallen mafia boss on fire and falling to his death, and parachutes onto Karen's St√∂rer (a parody of the Koenigsegg CCX). Reception The game received mixed reviews upon release, earning a score of 61 out of 100 at Metacritic. TouchArcade gave Gangstar Vegas four stars out of five in a review, called the game \\"open-ended, violent, destruction-filled fun\\" and praised the game's graphics, but criticised the \\"hit and miss\\" voice acting, controls and technical issues. A more critical review came from Pocket Gamer, who viewed the game as misogynistic and bemoaned its control scheme and lack of polish, stating \\"where its inspirations - the likes of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - are filled with exciting set pieces, interesting characters, and fun gewgaws, Gangstar Vegas is a sloppy, empty experience full of hollow-eyed caricatures.\\" Notes References External links *Official site Gameloft games Gangstar 2013 video games 2014 video games 2015 video games 2016 video games Action-adventure games Action video games Android (operating system) games Open world video games Video games developed in Canada Video games set in the Las Vegas Valley Alien invasions in video games Video games with downloadable content IOS games Free-to-play video games Organized crime video games Mixed martial arts video games North America-exclusive video games Science fiction video games Spy video games Superhero video games Terrorism in fiction Video games using Havok Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Gangstar Vegas"},{"id":"46528790","text":"Kelly McCarthy (born March 28, 1966) is a Democratic member of the Montana House of Representatives who represents the 49th District.

Circassians in Iran differ somewhat from other Circassians in diaspora in that most in the former stem from the Safavid and Qajar era, although a number migrated as muhajirs in the late 19th century as well. The Circassians in Iran were very influential during periods in the last few centuries. The vast majority of them have assimilated to Persian language, and no sizeable number speaks their native Circassian languages anymore. Once a very large minority in Iran, nowadays due to being heavily assimilated over the course of time and the lack of censuses based on ethnicity, population estimates vary significantly. They are, after the Georgians, the largest Caucasus-derived group in the nation. In Persian, the word Cherkes () is sometimes applied generally to Caucasian peoples living beyond Derbent in Dagestan, which was the northernmost principal city of Iran prior to its ceding to Russia in the first half of the 19th century following the Treaty of Gulistan. History Circassians in Iran have a long history. To a certain good extent, they shared the same role as their brethren who lived in neighbouring Ottoman Turkey; many were importees, deportees, slaves, but also made up many of the notable noble families in the empire, while many others were kingmakers, military commanders, soldiers, craftsmen, peasants, while they also composed many of the kings' wives and women in the harem. Under the various kings of the Safavid and Qajar dynasty, many Circassians would eventually happen to live in Iran. Safavids The first Circassian presence in Iran dates to the early Safavid era, during which Shaykh Junayd raided various regions of Circassia and carried of prisoners back.Eskandar Beg, I, pp. 17‚Äì18 From the time of king (shah) Tahmasp I (r. 1524-1576), the Circassians started to play an important role in Iranian society, and began to appear as a large ethnic group in the successive empires based in Iran. In order to make a counterbalance to the tribal, ethnic, and favoured interests the Qizilbash gave which make a system imbalanced, Tahmasp I had already been making the first steps of creating a new layer in Iranian society. The kings before Tahmasp and he himself often found themselves incapable of ruling effectively due to the extremely strong influence the Qizilbash expressed in all spheres of the empire. The Qizilbash had formed the backbone of the Safaviyya from the earliest days, and they had always provided substantial military as well, on which the Safavids relied for a long period of time. In order to break this system, a counterbalance was needed, and a new layer in society was the medium through which this could be reached. This new layer in society, was called the \\"third force\\", as they were a new ethnic class, or \\"force\\", alongside the Turkomans and Persians. This new layer, initiated by Tahmasp I, would be composed of many hundreds of thousands of Christian and pagan Caucasian, mostly ethnically Circassian and Georgian, deportees, importees, slaves, and migrants. This new society layer was to be eventually fully accomplished and implemented by king Abbas I (r. 1588-1629). Out of this new layer, a new military force was established as well; a force that would directly contest the hegemony of the Qizilbash everywhere in the empire, replace them from all their positions, thereby firmly securing the kings' grip over the kingdom. These gholams, or \\"military slaves\\", were part of this newly created layer in society. The gholam slave system, although initiated by Tahmasp I, was perfectioned and fully implemented by king Abbas I, and its rank and file were drawn from these massive amounts of ethnic Circassians, Georgians, Armenians and other peoples of the Caucasus, such as Lezgins. Eventually, these large amounts of Circassians and other Caucasians, only loyal to the shah, replaced the Qizilbash and vied through the system with them for political hegemony and supremacy, and were to be victorious, although sometimes they would vy against each other as well.Babaie, Sussan (2004). \\"Slaves of the Shah: New Elites of Safavid Iran.\\" pp. 17, I.B.Tauris, Circassians made up a good bulk of these elite armies (the so-called gholams), and played therefore a pivotal role. This elite [slave system] army was similar to the Janissaries of neighbouring Ottoman Turkey, in its implementation and formation. The ones in the armies received, after advanced education, conversion to Islam, and upbringing by Muslim families, the best military training and equipment, and were the strongest force and class of the empire. Other large amounts of Circassians were, like the Georgians, employed and deployed in all other possible aspects and positions that the empires offered, such as the harem, civil administration, military administration, peasantry, and crafts, amongst others, while other large numbers were initially settled in various regions in mainland Iran, including Gilan, Mazandaran, and Fars. According to Thomas Herbert, who was in Safavid Iran in the first half of the 17th century, Aspas was inhabited by some 40,000 transplanted Christian Circassians and Georgians.Thomas Herbert. Travels in Persia: 1627-1629 Routledge, 10 okt. 2005 p 117 By the time of king Suleiman I's reign (r. 1666‚Äì1694), an estimated 20,000 Circassians, Dagestanis, and Georgians were living in the Safavid capital of Isfahan alone. Many of the shahs, princes, and princesses descended from noble Circassian lines. Many of the Safavid nobility at the court were Circassian.Aptin Khanbaghi. The Fire, the Star and the Cross: Minority Religions in Medieval and Early Modern Iran I.B.Tauris, 22 February 2006 pp. 130‚Äì131 In fact, the Safavids their heavily mixed ancestry includes several Circassian lines. Safavid Iran: Rebirth of a Persian Empire, L.B. Tauris. 2006, p. 41.Rudolph (Rudi) Matthee Encyclopaedia Iranica, Columbia University, New York 2001, p. 493 King Abbas II (r. 1642-1666) and Shah Suleiman I (r. 1666-1694) are just some of the examples amongst the highest nobility that were born by Circassian mothers. Qajars Following the mass expulsion of the native Circassians of the Northwest Caucasus in 1864 mainly towards the Ottoman Empire, some also fled to neighboring Qajar Iran, which bordered the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Russia. In Iran, the government followed an assimilation policy, starting the gradual absorption of the Caucasian refugees into the population. Some of these deportees from after 1864 rose to various high ranks such as in the Persian Cossack Brigade, where every member of the army was either Circassian or any other type of ethnos from the Caucasus. Modern day Despite heavy assimilation over the centuries, Circassian settlements have lasted into the 20th century. However, the Circassian languages once also widely used by the large Circassian minority, no sizable number of Circassians in Iran speak the language anymore.

As befits their genre, their music is often inspired by geek pop culture, the band is named after a Robotech exclamation and each member uses a stage name based on the Star Wars expanded universe. History The band started with friends, and half of the initial band members, Scott Cushman and Dwight Reid joking that, with all the time consumed by their jobs and families, they should start a band so they could then only practice twice a year and never play live shows. In 2009, Cushman's wife dared them to actually perform, which led to the formation of the band and their first show. The band have stated that \\"nothing is too nerdy or too geeky to inspire us in music.\\" For example, the song \\"Frak Off\\" developed, from an attempt to string together as many science fiction swear words as possible, into a narrative about a nerdy girl dumping her boyfriend. Other songs directly reference specific media, such as the board game The Settlers of Catan (\\"Wood for Sheep\\"), the 1984 The Karate Kid film (\\"Cobra Kai Fight Song\\") and the Scott Pilgrim graphic novels (\\"Scott Pilgrim Vs. My Heart\\"). The source of songs within the band are also varied: \\"I've Got a Thing for the Goblin King\\", about David Bowie's character in the 1986 film Labyrinth, was suggested by frontwoman Jaime \\"Minn\\" McGeathy and \\"Monster Movie\\" started as just a guitar riff. Song creation is a collaborative effort for the band, although a lot of the writing is by Cushman. Beyond the music itself, the band members use Star Wars-based stage names and the name of band itself comes from an exclamation used by the character Captain Henry Gloval in Robotech. As of 2013, they say \\"probably the nerdiest thing we've done was play a show at The Hard Rock Caf√© for the Microsoft Techready convention.\\" The band filmed their first music video, for \\"Kill Screen of My Heart\\", at Portland's Ground Kontrol arcade in May 2012; which opened early to allow them access. Their first album, Tomorrow's Yesterdays Today! was released in December of the same year. Their second album, The Nerd Punk Guide to the Galaxy, was released in October 2014. The song \\"Sexy Lamp\\", based on comic book writer Kelly Sue DeConnick's Sexy Lamp Test for female characters, was highlighted by DeConnick herself on Tumblr in August 2014. In 2014, McGeathy was part of the \\"Women in Nerd Music\\" panel at GeekGirlCon with Angela and Aubrey Webber of The Doubleclicks, Molly Lewis, Sammus and Shubzilla.

The Punk News review lists \\"Scott Pilgrim Vs My Heart\\" as the strongest song on the album, stating that the band \\"unleash some strong riffs and clever lyrics, once again delivered in an almost disinterested, but perfect, way by the excellent Minn.\\" Also highlighted is \\"I've Got a Thing for the Goblin King\\" as \\"an extremely catchy tune with a basic but memorable refrain.\\" Overall the album is described as \\"quite riff laden, with the guitar driving the songs along assisted by some energetic bass lines and a keen, snapping drum sound, all of which helps makes this the amusing and enjoyable musical romp it is.\\" The Nerd Punk Guide to the Galaxy Second studio album; released October 2014.

One day, while the rivals are on a fishing trip, near the summer resort at which they are guests, they come across Ethel busily engaged with paints and canvas at the edge of the stream. The rivals immediately forsake their fishing and propose to Ethel.

She tells them she will marry the one that catches the largest fish by three o'clock. This works like magic on the boys, and both hurry away to fish. Evidently thinking that \\"all is fair to love and fishing,\\" Frank goes to the State Fish Hatchery and buys a large fish from the keeper. Billy apparently reasons the same way for he buys a large fish from a boy whom he run across on the stream. At three, Frank calls upon Ethel at her cottage and gives his fish to her. Billy comes in a moment later and also presents Ethel with a fish. Both boys hurry away to change their clothes. Ethel telling them to return a little later to see the fish weighed. Now it is very apparent that Frank's fish is the larger of the two, but Ethel, who really prefers Billy, decides that Billy shall win. The boys return. Frank's fish weighs 3 1/4 pounds and Billy's which is much smaller tips the scales at 3 3/4 pounds. Frank, however is a game loser. He congratulates Billy on his success, then makes his exit.

It is native to the Indo-Pacific region and its range extends from the Red Sea through the Indian Ocean to the Western Pacific Ocean. This is a common species throughout its wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Colonies of Favites pentagona are encrusting or massive, sometimes with lobes forming irregular columns. The colony may spread to about a metre (yard) across. The corallites are less than in diameter. The corallite walls are sharply-angled and thin, and several polyps may share a common wall. The palliform lobes are clearly visible on the oral disc and there are a small number of septa. This coral is often vividly coloured, with contrasting (often green) oral discs and brown, red or purple coenosarc, the living tissue that covers the skeleton between the polyps. Distribution Favites pentagona is native to the Indo-Pacific region where it occurs in shallow tropical and subtropical seas. Its range extends from the Red Sea and South Africa to India, Indonesia, Japan and Australia, where it occurs both in Western Australia and the Great Barrier Reef. Its depth range is down to and it is common on rocky reefs, outer reef channels, reef slopes and lagoons. Ecology Brown coenosarc and green oral discs Favites pentagona is a zooxanthellate species of coral. This means that it harbours symbiotic unicellular dinoflagellates in its tissues, which use the energy from sunlight to synthesize nutrients, from which the host coral benefits. It is an aggressive species of coral. At night it extends its polyps to feed on plankton, and expands its elongated sweeper tentacles armed with stinging cells well beyond the limits of its base, so as to avoid being crowded or overgrown by other organisms. It clears away sand that settles on its surface by inflating its polyps to dislodge the sediment. F. pentagona is a simultaneous hermaphrodite, the eggs and sperm being released in well-formed bundles. In any one area, spawning tends to occur in synchrony, with all the corals liberating their gamete bundles at the same time. These rise to the sea surface and float, thus maximising the chance of successful fertilisation. F. pentagona is susceptible to black band disease and white plague, two coral diseases which have become more common since the 1990s. Status Favites pentagona has a very wide range and is common over much of that range. There is no precise information on population trends but this coral faces the same threats as other species; global warming, ocean acidification and degradation of its coral reef habitats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Opposition to Marriage and Conscience Act On May 19, 2015, Bouie was among ten legislators on the House Civil Law and Procedure Committee who voted to table the proposed Marriage and Conscience Act, authored by Republican Representative Mike Johnson of Bossier Parish and strongly supported by the conservative Louisiana Family Forum. Only his fellow Republican Ray Garofalo of Chalmette stood with Johnson. Governor Bobby Jindal, who supported the legislation, then issued an executive order to implement the measure. Johnson said that he will in 2016, if he is reelected, re-introduce the measure because he prefers a statutory law to address the issue. Johnson explained that the measure is designed to block the state government from pulling licenses or tax benefits from a company because of the owner's counter view of same-sex marriage. Other Democrats who opposed the measure were committee chairman Neil Abramson of New Orleans, Patrick O. Jefferson of Arcadia, and Alfred C. Williams of Baton Rouge.

Srisaila Khanda of Skand Purana praises this temple as 'Nirvrutti Sangameswara' because of its reputation of devotees giving up lives in devotion to Lord Shiva. Whatever is the legend if is associated, it is now widely acknowledged that the temple of Sri Vaidyanatheswara has been in this temple complex from at least around 7th Century BCE. This is corroborated by various Puranas including the Srisaila Khanda of Skanda Purana and Sriranga Mahatmya of Garuda Purana. Geographically Pushpagiri temple complex is located on the banks of the Pinakini river that meanders through the District which has origins on Nandi Hills in Karnataka and is at a distance of about 16 kilometres from the district headquarters.  Etymology  The name Pushpagiri derives from a local legend that to extricate his mother Vinutha from the shackles of slavery of his stepmother Kadruva, Garuda has embarked on a journey to the heavens to conquer Lord Indra and fetch the holy nectar of Ambrosia. Garuda while returning from the heavenly abode passed by the hamlet then called - Kampalle, where he unintentionally spilt a drop into a local pond formed by the river Pinakini. The pond immediately was granted divine powers of transforming back to their youth, all those that took a dip in it. Consequently, people began to throng the pond for a dip in its waters. Upon seeing this unprecedented miracle, the Devas approached God Vishnu who instructs Garuda to cover up the pond with a rock from a nearby mountain. The megalith Garuda placed on the pond, started floating like a flower - Pushpa in Sanskrit. To stop it from raising again, God Vishnu and God Shiva drove the rock under with their feet into the land. Thus the name Pushpagiri which in Sanskrit would mean a flowery mound.A. Umamaheswara Shastry - A thesis on the inscriptions of Cuddapah district (‡∞ï‡∞°‡∞™ ‡∞ú‡∞ø‡∞≤‡±ç‡∞≤‡∞æ ‡∞∂‡∞æ‡∞∏‡∞®‡∞æ‡∞≤‡±Å)  Geography  The temple complex is located at above the sea level and covers an approximate area of . There is lush greenery surrounding the hamlets that include in the temple complex with crops watered from the rain as well as the river year round. Despite the hot tropical summers in the region, there is always water in the area due to the underwater level butted by the river. Apart from the small arid mountainous area where the mound is supposed to have fallen, the entire region is full of greenery on all sides with plenty of crops mainly paddy. During the rainy season, the area is quite a sight for the beholders. The river Pinakini flows from west to east, changing its course towards the south at Pushpagiri and soon after the hamlet of Sivalapalle, the river changes its course again to travel east finally opening into the sea in Nellore District.  Climate  Pushpagiri shares a tropical climate with the Cuddapah district as with the encompassing region of Rayalaseema. The summers are long and hot with temperatures ranging between 37 ¬∞C and 45 ¬∞C. The river almost dries up during the summer season with water left only in some pools made by the previous flow. The summer will occur between the months of April and July. With the onset of monsoons the climate starts cooling down and the river swells up during the rains which could sometimes be very hazardous especially during the torrential rains in the months of August to October when the occurrence of hurricanes and low depressions are very common. The floods to the river can cause the swirling waters to precariously perch on the edges of the banks with all the river bed submerged. The months between September and March are relatively cool, December being the coolest with a temperature averaging between 17 ¬∞C and 23 ¬∞C. This is the best time to visit the temples around and many people visit the area to perform spiritual pilgrimages as well as for sightseeing.  History   The early kings and saints  The first mention of Pushpagiri was about the old Indranatha Swamy temple. After the snake sacrifice, King Janamejaya performed a pilgrimage to the South India and in the process visited Pushpagiri. The hamlet of Chintalapatturu has an inscription in old Tamil that talks about the pilgrimage of King Janamejaya. About 10 kilometres from the confluence of Papagni and Pinakini rivers, there used to be an ashram of Agastya Maharishi. Sage Agastya after crossing the Vindhya mountains, vowed not to return to stop the range from growing in competition with Himalayas. While the sage himself stayed in the South, his disciples installed a Linga in the nearby place and left for the Ganges plains. The temple for the Linga came to be called after the great saint Agastya as Sri Agastheeswara Swamy temple. There is a lot of documented history about the Pushpagiri Temple Complex. The temple has a mention in the Skanda Purana in Srisaila Khanda, Rasaratnakara of Satyanatha. It has been mentioned as the Dakshina Dwara - Southern gate for the famous Jyothirlinga site of Srisailam in Ikshvaku inscriptions that were later excavated from the site. The place has been considered sacred from the ages of Karikala Chola of the early Chola Dynasty.A 1463 CE dated inscription before the Vaidyanatha Swamy temple, Pushpagiri It is famous for the architectural styles originating from the Early Cholas culminating in the modern architecture and houses a variety of temples that have varied ages and significance. Since there is a belief among the later kingdoms that reigned the region that from the joyful cosmic dance of God Shiva at the Bhoga Nandeeswara Swamy temple on top of the Nandi Hills, three rivers took their origin. Pinakini or Penna River (in vernacular language), Arkavati and Palar. While the other two rivers took their course to become the tributaries of the Cauvery river, Pinakini asked God Shiva the purpose of her birth and to what direction she should flow. God Shiva then said that his bow will show the river the way and pointed towards the east and a gorge evolved on the earth giving way for the mighty waters to flow through. Since the bow of God Shiva is named Pinaka, the river is hence called Pinakini after the bow of the God. Various kings, rulers and local chieftains that ruled the area have endowed the temple complex with grants and monuments.  Patronage under later kings and chieftains  As the kings changed and new dynasties emerged, various kings from various dynasties have endowed the temple with bountiful gifts and grants. Somadeva of Vaidumba Dynasty who usurped power from the Cholas has provided grants to the temple including the Pallava king Chiddana Devaraja. Another king from the Kesa dynasty Yadava Singana. The temple of Vaidyanatheswara Swamy was patronised by the Rashtrakuta king Krishna Vallabha who provided lands for the daily maintenance of the temple. A rock inscription to this effect has been excavated by the ASI. Gangaya Sahini and Ambadeva who were the chieftains of Kakatiya dynasty built various other temples in the names of themselves as well as their wives and daughters which add to the architectural glory of the temple.The History of Andhra Country, 1000 A.D.-1500 A.D. by Yashoda Devi; The temple for Chennakesava Swamy was built by the Musunuri Nayaks under the rule of the later Vijayanagara kings. Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya while he was ruling the Vijayanagara Empire has made multiple grants to the Chennakesava Swamy temple and to other temples in this temple complex. There was a lot of disturbance from the dacoits who used to way-lay the travellers in this region. Saluva as asked his feudatory Vankara kumara Dhuli Basivi Naidu to safeguard the pilgrims who are on their way to this place. After a couple of generations, the successors of Naidu joined hands with the bandits and during the time of Krishnadevaraya he summoned Musili Naidu and advised him against such activities. Naidu initially revolted against the rulers of Vijayanagara Empire and used to harass the pilgrims as a way to show his disloyalty but started to obey the king once he was made the in-charge of the surrounding villages with the capital at a place called \\"Jillella\\". Pushpagiri used to be a very popular pit-stop for the pilgrims that travelled the Varanasi- Rameswaram route. Rameswaram-Varanasi -Rameswaram was one of the Char Dham routes followed and prescribed by Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya who proposed the Advaita Vedanta and also established a mutt in these premises. In one of the inscriptions, A tantric saint by the name Aghora Shivacharya has been credited with constructing the main Gateway-Tower (Gopuram) of the Chennakesava Swamy temple.  Culture  alt=The serpent symbolises the Kula rasa that flows through the six chakras in a human body. The erect penis is a symbolism of the famous Hata yoga Telugu is the main language spoken here. However, when the annual fair happens there are people from various places across South India and the area is flooded with various cultures and practices. From ages immemorial, this place has been a host to various practices including Veerapasupatha. The Vaidyanatha Swamy temple on the west bank of Penna river houses an idol of Nakulisa (also called Lakulisa) which is a testimony that various age-old cultures and practices of ancient Hinduism have been in practice in Pushpagiri area for a long time. Further, the links of the local Mutt of Sri Pushpagiri Shankara Peetham to Srisailam temple as the patron-institution corroborate the fact that Veerapasupatha or Shakteya cults of Hinduism have been practised here by the roaming monks and Sadhus. Srisailam has a temple dedicated to Hatakeswara, renowned as the Lord of Pasupatham cult and is famous for various Vamachara along with Samyachara ways of worship. Other inscriptions excavated along the belt of Yerragudipadu village to the Chintalapattur village also hold a testimony that these kinds of worship have been practised by the local folk as well as the visitors to the place. The temple complex and other villages in the vicinity have dispersed temples that are dedicated to both Shaiva and Vaishnava practices of worship. At a time when South India has been experiencing widespread tensions because of the difference of opinion regarding the superiority of their own cults, this area cuddled in almost obscurity of the forests and mountains has been a place of worship for both Shaivas and Vaishnavas alike.  Architecture  The architectural styles of the Pushpagiri temple complex range from the age of Ikshvakus to the modern chieftains that subordinated to the kings of Vijayanagara empire. The geographical position of Cuddapah district with mountainous boundaries gave rise to a lot of local feudal kingdoms that have thwarted the onslaught of foreign rules (both Indian and foreign) for a long time. The temple complex has documented history from early Ikshvakus to the local Zamindars that ruled the area. To name a few, it has remnants of the past belonging to Ikshvakus, Pallavas, Cholas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Vaidumbas, Kayasthas and Vijayanagara empires. The Vaidyanatha Swamy temple is a splendid structure and is adorned with a variety of rock-cut sculptures and reliefs of various Hindu Gods and Goddesses. The most striking and categorically ancient temple is this which has the Srichakra in the shrine of Kamakshi on the left as one enters the temple from the northern tower-gate. The entire temple consists of two shrines one dedicated for Vaidyanatha Swamy and another for Kamakshi Devi which is surrounded by various idols of the Hindu deities and Hero-Stones that were excavated and preserved by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)Indranatha Swamy temple, View from the Entrance Long before the struggle between Shaivites and Vaishnavites started, there was a sense of communal harmony amongst the people of Cuddapah district, especially those in the Pushpagiri region, It is evident from a variety of undamaged structures in the region that have stood side by side with no vandalism instigated by the various communal philosophies. There are various temples that stand testimony to this fact, two of which are just kilometers apart. The Vaishnavaite temple of Chennakesava and the temples surrounding it are of Indranatha, Bhimeswara, Trikuteswara and Vaidyanatheswara. While the Chennakesava temple stands towards the east bank of the river with its magnificent gateway-tower facing west, the Indranatha Swamy temple is ducked on the north bank of the river just opposite to the village of Pushpagiri. The earliest reference to this temple was made in an inscription in 1078 CE which registers a land by the Ahavamalladeva of Vaidumba dynasty. Another inscription dated 1182 CE grants some land in the area of Mulakanadu for the daily worship of the presiding deity of the temple.View of Pushpagiri Village and Chennakesava temple from Indranatha Swamy templeThe Indranatha Swamy temple faces east with a deck of steps arising from the Penna river There is a temple courtyard, a dilapidated gateway-tower. The Gopura of the temple is slightly towards the south-west of the temple and the temple is roughly a square. As one enters the temple there is a Mandapa towards the left supported by 12 pillars sculpted in perfect harmony. In the circumambulation path of the temple, towards the North-west is a \\"Bilva tree\\" which was considered sacred for the worship of God Shiva. Inline with the ancient architecture, the Linga housed inside a sanctum sanctorum before which is a 16-pillared Mukhamandapa that is surrounded by three sub-shrines. The Antaralaya emanates from the Mukhamantapa and leads to the main shrine where the Linga is still residing, though there is no worship as such. Outside the structure lies a Mandapa for Nandi. The characteristic feature of this temple is the 16-pillared and vast open-pillared mandapa that leads into the main shrine. All the sub-shrines are vacant with no idols of any sort except the main shrine. thumb Inscription on the frontal wall of Indranatha Swamy temple, Pushpagiri The temple of Chennakesava is another standing testimony to the art of ancient scions of dynasties that ruled this place. The detail that has gone into sculpting the rocks and boulders to become beautiful structures is outstanding. The presiding deity is Chennakesava Swamy which is the God that Cholas patronised across the generations. There are more temples dedicated to Chennakesava across the length and breadth of the Cuddapah district and they bear a striking resemblance to the Chennakesava temple in Pushpagiri. The Chennakesava temple faces west with a tall Dwajasthambam (flag-staff) overlooking the Penna river as it changes course from east to south. From the main gateway-tower, there is a path that leads to the Pushpagiri temples inside the hamlet of Pushpagiri. The temple of Chennakesava is an artistic structure with three Shrines inside and two sub-shrines outside of the elevated platform. The shrines inside the platform have the main deity of Chennakesava and Shrine to the left dedicated for a Shiva Linga. There is another small shrine where it was said that a seated structure of Umamaheswara Swamy was once present which was vandalised and left vacant now. A relief on the back wall of the shrine is supposed to be a replica of the deity that once adorned the Shrine. In the circumambulation path of the temple, there is another sub-shrine that houses a Shiva Linga towards the North-east side of the elevated platform.leftThe temple is built with elaborate carvings on all sides and the shrines that house the Shiva Linga and the Chennakesava Swamy are separated by a ridge so that a Parikrama can be done for individual shrines. However, the characteristic feature of this temple is that both the Shrines have a single flag-staff that has Garuda with folded hands facing the Chennakesava Swamy shrine. The shrine of Chennakesava faces west and houses an idol of standing Chennakesava Swamy towering at almost 10 feet. The elaborate carvings on the stone \\"halo\\" of the idol show the ten avataras of Vishnu. The temple is still in worship today with both the Linga and idol revered. As the Parikrama of the shrine is completed, there is a shrine for Rajyalakshmi Devi, the consort of Chennakesava Swamy. There is a mandapa towards the right of the shrine for Rajyalakshmi devi and a shrine lowering to the level of the steps into the river for Hanuman which seems to have been added to the complex at a later stage. The Gopuram that faces west has its origins from the time of Aghora Sivacharya and is renovated multiple times during various periods. The carvings on the shrines depict various Hindu Gods and Goddesses in various postures and depict the stories of Ramayana and Mahabharatha. Most of the carvings are in a relatively better position than Indranatha Swamy temple and the temple is currently under the protection of Central Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) catalogued #41 as Sivakesava Swamy temple.  Inscriptions  Pushpagiri temple complex has a variety of inscriptions ranging a wide range of periods. The architectural styles of the temples that adorn the complex have undergone quite a lot of changes during the rules of various Kings and their feudal subjects. Some of the inscriptions have either become non- readable or have worn out due to wither negligence or vandalism of the subsequent rulers. Some of the noteworthy inscriptions that could are still legible are as below: # Trailokya Malla Raju - In the year 991 CE, Malla Raju has noticed that the main idol of the Chennakesava Swamy temple was in a dilapidated situation and has undertaken a restoration work.

The same Ganagaya Sahini has mentioned in another inscription that he has also presented the village of Atluru which was at a distance of about 30 kilometres from Pushpagiri to the temple complex. The inscription to this effect was erected in the year 1196 CE. # Tripurari Sivayya - In the year 1226 CE, when Ambadeva, another chieftain of Kakatiya Empire was ruling the southern districts, Sivayya has presented some land to his Guru, 'Sivacharyulu' under the ayacut of Cuddapah Pond. # Sammeta Kampayya - In the year 1348 CE, a feudatory to the king of Nellore, Kampayya has circumabulated the hill of Pushpagiri for 1000 times and made some repairs to the ballasts of the Chennakesava temple and other temples in the complex. # Deva Raya - In the year 1406 CE, Deva Raya has visited Pushpagiri and erected an inscription at the Indranatha Swany temple. The inscription is currently illegible due to climatic wear and tear. # Krishna Deva Raya - In the year 1509 CE, as soon as Krishna Deva Raya was instilled on throne at Vijayanagara, he has presented the village of Chinnamachupalle to Pushpagiri Chennakesava Swamy temple A Kannada inscription to this effect has been found in the village of Chinnamachupalle.

Styles of worship  Predominantly a Shaivite place, Pushpagiri also has numerous temples dedicated to various Vaishnava deities. Apart from the ubiquitous Shaiva and Vaishnava styles, there are various other styles of worship have existed here like Jainism, Buddhism, Golaki, Aaradhya, Kapalika, Kalamukha, Rasasaivam, Shakteya and Soura.

Henequen spines for jewelry in M√©rida Henequen industry in Yucat√°n Peninsula is an agribusiness of a plant native to Yucat√°n, Mexico. After extraction from the plant, henequen is processed as a textile in various forms to obtain a range of products for domestic, commercial, agricultural and industrial use, as binder twine for crops such as hay. Until the mid-20th century, it was a major industrial activity, the mooring of vessels depending on it. Its decline is attributed to the industry size, its socio-economic impact, as well as the invention of synthetic fibers and the manufacturing from these of substitute products which displaced henequen and sisal fibers. In addition to its fiber, the juice extracted from the henequen plant has been industrialized as a liquor similar to tequila. Also derived from its juice are certain steroidal chemicals used in the pharmaceutical industry. Etymology The English term agave was known in the Mayan languages as ki. Henequen (Agave fourcroydes) was referred to as henequen blanco by the Spaniards and sakki by the Mayan, while sisal (Agave sisalana,) was henequen verde to the Spaniards and yaxqui to the Maya. Land preparation in the 19th century Just before the rainy season sets in the vegetation ‚Äî dry as tinder from the rays of a tropical sun that having beaten down on it for months ‚Äî is burned off. The drenching rains of the wet season mingle the ashes with the soil, which is all the fertilizing it needs. Then at the opening of the next season, sometimes after a second light burning off, the ground is divided into mecates, or spaces about . To each worker are given so many mecates to plant daily. He makes a series of holes, very shallow, in the burned soil about apart in each direction, and in these holes places a bud or cutting of a henequen plant. Each mecate then contains from 80 to 100 plants. The holes are not made with a shovel or hoe, but with a stout stick shod with a sharp iron point, and the holes are frequently mere excavations in the soft, friable, limestone rock. The workers work at planting very swiftly, and in an incredibly short time a vast extent of territory is planted. During the whole of the first season, and especially toward the close of the rains, the newly planted ground has to be kept clear. This work is done with the machete. In less than three years, the plants are so large that further care is unnecessary, and in from five to seven years they begin to yield. The plants then are nearly high, and bear a great number of stout leaves from long. They continue bearing for 20 years. The edges of these leaves are provided with innumerable sharp thorns, sickle or fish-hook shaped, and the point of the leaf is prolonged into a black, very sharp spike or thorn-like. Production The henequen is first cut from the stem quite near the ground, then carried to the mill where it is torn into shreds by machinery, and then hung upon rails in the sun to dry, after which it is put up in bales which are compressed by machinery. The whole process is at once simple and effective, and a great quantity may be baled in a single day. The henequen arrives at maturity, or at a point ready for cutting, in from five to seven years. The leaves, when at their best, are from in length. Each plant yields 20 or 30 leaves yearly for a period of 12 to 20 years, about a third more in the rainy than in the dry season. It takes over 8,000 leaves to make a 400-pound bale. The bales vary in weight from 350 to 450 pounds each. The period of 1880 to 1915 are considered to be the henequen boom years. In 1873, it exported 31,000 bales; 1879, 113,000 bales; 1884, 261,000; 1904, 606,000; and in 1915, 1.2 million bales were exported. The production of henequen in 1900 was 500,000 bales; in 1914, the production was 1,026,000 bales; in 1918 the production had declined to 805,000 bales. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were planted in henequen. This reached an all-time high ‚Äî more than 70% of all cultivated land in Yucat√°n ‚Äî in 1916 with . History In 1898, when the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out, the price of fiber advanced rapidly. The supplies of Manila hemp were interrupted on account of the war conditions in the Philippine Islands, and that caused an advance in the price of henequen to about US$0.10 or $0.12 a pound. That sudden advance in the price brought great wealth to Yucat√°n and it immediately took first rank among the Mexican States. Shortly after 1900, the State of Yucat√°n showed very rapid strides in education, sanitation, and in the general improvement in the well being of the people. That price, which was high at that time, brought about a boom in Yucat√°n and the usual consequences of a boom followed, so that there were from 1907 until 1911 a few mild panics brought about by speculation and over-extension not only by the banks but by various commercial firms. The henequen industry was established on a very solid and profitable basis. The state whose only product, or whose only source of revenue, was henequen, became one of the richest States in the Republic of Mexico. At the time of Salvador Alvarado's entry into Yucat√°n it was the richest State in the Republic of Mexico. The planters received an average price of about US$0.05 per pound for their fiber. There were various buyers and exporters of henequen in Yucat√°n up until 1915, when Alvarado drove them out. When Alvarado reached M√©rida, he seized the railways of the State. In 1912, shortly after the inauguration of the first military governor, Nicol√°s Cam√°ra Vales, an organization was made of various henequen planters in conjunction with the government of the State. This organization was named the Comision Reguladora del Comercio del Henequen (CRMH), commonly known as the Reguladora. The purpose of that organization was to regulate the henequen industry -‚Äî that is to say, that when in the operation of the law of supply and demand any large accumulation of henequen took place, the Reguladora was to take this accumulation off the market and hold it until such time as the demand caught up with the supply. The governor of Yucat√°n was always president ex-officio of the Reguladora. The Reguladora functioned with more or less success but played no important part in the commercial or economic life of Yucat√°n. When Alvarado assumed power in 1915, he assumed charge of the Reguladora, appointed his own board of directors, and gave notice that he was to arrange that the Reguladora would be the only institution or firm allowed to deal in henequen in Yucat√°n. Following out this policy, he ordered his director of the railways to refuse to transport any henequen shipped by anybody except to the consignment of the Reguladora.

He is best remembered as one of the pioneer first citizens of the town of Corvallis, Oregon and as the founder of the Willamette Valley & Coast Railroad (WV&C;), established in 1874. Biography Early years Bushrod Washington Wilson was born July 18, 1824 at Columbia Falls, Maine, into a family which on his paternal side dated its American roots back to the immigration of Gowan Wilson from Scotland in 1657.Charles Henry Carey, History of Oregon: Volume II. Chicago: Pioneer Historical Publishing Co., 1922; pg. 204. His mother was a member of the Pineo family, which dated its North American roots back to French Huguenots who emigrated to Nova Scotia in 1617. When Wilson was 10 his father moved to New York City to work as a millwright. Bush went to school until he was 12,Bruce Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly, vol. 39, No. 3 (Sept. 1938), pg. 270. at which time he left to go to work at an early age, taking a job as an office boy for Cornelius Vanderbilt and making the acquaintance of young newspaper publisher Horace Greeley.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pp. 270-271. The family would move again in 1838, this time to Illinois.Austin Munsell, \\"Historical Note,\\" \\"Guide to the Bushrod Washington Wilson Letters to Joseph P. Wilson, 1846-1875,\\" University of Oregon Libraries, Special Collections and University Archives, Eugene, OR, 2012. Wilson's father remarried in 1840 and Bush did not get along with his new stepmother, causing him to leave home to make his own way in the world.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 271. He worked his way across the country from St. Charles, Illinois to New York City, returning to the city of his boyhood. In October 1843, at the age of 19, Wilson joined the crew of a whaling ship out of New Bedford, Massachusetts, spending the next two and a half years at sea. The journey took him to the Society Islands in the South Pacific Ocean where he would remain for six months, followed by a season on the Northwest coast, where the ship on which he served would take 12,000 barrels of oil. From there he travelled to the Hawaiian Islands spending a season on the equator before returning again to the Northwest. After the end of his voyage he returned to New York City for a time, until the California Gold Rush of 1849, which motivated him to sail around the horn of South America to California to try his hand at mining. He arrived in San Francisco in July 1850 and spent just two weeks in the city before heading out to try his hand mining on the Yuba and American Rivers ‚Äî losing money and falling ill in the process.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pp. 272-273. Discouraged by the situation in California, Wilson sought to pursue greener pastures to the north, having heard promising things about mining opportunities upon the Umpqua River of the Oregon Territory.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 273. On October 15, 1850 he boarded the schooner Reindeer as a passenger and set out for the new opportunity. Move to Oregon Junction of the Marys and Willamette Rivers, today within the boundaries of Corvallis, Oregon After adverse weather which made the journey slow and treacherous, the Reindeer arrived at the mouth of the Umpqua, located near the southern boundary of the Oregon territory, on November 8, 1850. Wilson and his compatriots arrived to a virtually deserted place, and considered themselves \\"fooled as to the diggings on the Umpqua.\\"Bushrod Wilson letter to the Corvallis Gazette, Dec. 31, 1880; cited in Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 273. Wilson and four would be miners purchased a canoe from local Native American people and began to head up the river. Together with a companion Wilson made his way by foot over the Coast Mountain Range to the Willamette Valley, eventually arriving at the junction of the Willamette and Marys rivers ‚Äî the site of the present city of Corvallis, then a settlement called \\"Marysville.\\" There Wilson and his associate joined founding settlers Joseph C. Avery, James F. Dixon, and a small handful of others who had established homesteads under the Donation Land Claim Act.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 274. Wilson first worked as a carpenter, taking a land claim and building his own cabin, working for wages from others in his spare time.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pp. 274-275. Wilson had no aspirations at farming, instead spending the 1851 agricultural year building a 20 by 30 foot house, one full storey and a loft in height.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 275. Wilson was extremely enthusiastic about his new home, anticipating that Marysville would eventually be \\"one of the largest places in Oregon\\" and a \\"center of travel to and from California\\" as a commercial center on the banks of the north-and-south running Willamette River. Construction was booming and Wilson was able to clear a handsome $3 a day working as a carpenter, with all the construction work that could be handled. In 1855 Wilson married former Missouri resident turned Oregon pioneer Priscilla Owsley Yantis. The couple would ultimately raise 13 children, 9 of whom survived their childhood years to adulthood.Carey, History of Oregon, Vol. 2, pg. 206. He also spent time improving his homestead claim, clearing and cultivating a parcel of land, which he ultimately sold for $3,500.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 276. He speculated on town land parcels ultimately owning 20 lots valued at from $50 to $300 each. In 1858 Wilson liquidated many of his assets and used the money to purchase a steam-powered sawmill and planing mill located in Peoria, Oregon, located about 7 miles east of Corvallis.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 277. The facility was capable of turning out 12,000 board feet of lumber per day, material which allowed Wilson to clear an average of $7 per day. Martin stayed in the lumber business for just one year, ultimately selling the mill in 1859, carrying the loan and charging 20% interest. In search of a new occupation, Wilson decided to once again try his hand at placer mining, purchasing and operating gold mining claims on the Owyhee River in southern Idaho.Carey, History of Oregon, Vol. 2, pg. 205. This time he managed to do \\"better than the majority and came out about even.\\"Letter of Bushrod Wilson to Joseph P. Wilson (brother), Feb. 13, 1863; cited in Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 277. Wilson also constructed and operated the first ferry across the Snake River, near the site of today's Lewiston. He plied this trade for a short time before returning to Corvallis in 1861, where he also ran a ferry across the Willamette for about a year. Political career Wilson's earliest political allegiance was to the Whig Party.Portrait and Biographical Record of the Willamette Valley, Oregon: Containing Original Sketches of Many Well Known Citizens of the Past and Present: Part 2. Chicago, IL: Chapman Publishing Co., 1903; pp. 971-972. He had free-soil proclivities and supported the abolition of slavery. Following the demise of the Whig Party and establishment of the Republican Party, he became a member of that organization. In 1862 he was hired as deputy county clerk for Benton County. At the next election he successfully ran for county clerk, winning an office that he would ultimately hold for 15 consecutive terms ‚Äî a period of thirty years. Wilson was a prominent member of the Republican Party of Oregon and was frequently urged by his political friends to run for Governor of Oregon or United States Congress ‚Äî requests which were invariably turned aside. In an 1875 letter to his brother Joseph, Bushrod Wilson noted the pecuniary rationale for his aversion to candidacy in state-level politics, writing: > \\"I have been offered, time and again, high positions in the state but I > positively refused. They don't give state officials enough to live in the > style that would be required...\\"Bushrod Wilson, letter to Joseph Wilson, > Jan. 30, 1875; cited in Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 279. It has additionally been noted by one biographer of Wilson that the monetary aspect of public service may have had a decisive impact on Wilson's decision not to run for re-election as county clerk in 1894, since that year marked a change of the system of pay of the position from a fee-based schedule to salary.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 279. Whereas in 1894, Wilson realized an annual salary of about $2,400 under the old system, his 1895 salary would have totaled just $1,500 per year ‚Äî likely helping to spur the decision to retire from the position. Wilson was active in community affairs, and was a thirty-second degree Mason. He was also one of the founders of the Corvallis Library Association in December 1872.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 281. He was also elected Chair of the Benton County Board of Immigration in May 1885. Business career In July 1874 Wilson organized the Willamette Valley & Coast Railroad Company (WV&C;), which aimed to construct an east-west railway from Yaquina Bay at today's Newport, Oregon all the way across Oregon, ultimately connecting with a track being laid by the Chicago & Northwestern as part of a potentially lucrative transcontinental railway project. The scheme would allow for the transport of grain from the Willamette Valley to the coast, where it could be transported by ship to various locations around the world. After paying for the initial surveys out of pocket, Wilson obtained financial commitments from other local investors, who became stockholders in his railway firm. He served as president of the corporation for one year, followed by six years as secretary after the fledgling company was absorbed by the Oregon Pacific Railroad.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 282. Wilson was involved in a business subsidiary of the Oregon Pacific, the Oregon Development Company. The company established regular steam vessel service between Yaquina Bay and San Francisco Bay and ran boats from Portland to Corvallis on the Willamette in an effort to develop region trade, making the area more lucrative for the Oregon Pacific's rail lines. He was also an investor in the Oregon & California Railroad, running a line from San Francisco to Portland and was influential in gaining federal money for the development of the Yaquina Bay harbor. In 1885, Wilson and two other investors established the Gazette Publishing Company, which purchased the local Republican daily, the Corvallis Gazette, from its previous publisher, M. S. Woodcock.Corvallis Gazette, Dec. 25, 1885; cited in Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 281.

He died with no property, having sold his lots in Corvallis and other assets by 1883 to cover the cost of his railroad investments.Martin, \\"Bushrod Washington Wilson,\\" pg. 283.

Mischler Financial Group is based in Newport Beach, California, with co- headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and regional offices in Chicago, Illinois, Boston, Massachusetts, Red Bank, New Jersey, and Detroit, Michigan. History In 1989, California established the Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise (DVBE) Program, which formally classified service-disabled veterans (SDVs) as a minority group for the purpose of state and municipal government contract awards and entitled Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses (SDVOBs) the same recognition as that provided to other State-recognized minority business owners, including women-owned businesses, African-American- owned businesses and Hispanic-American-owned businesses. The Act promoted self-reliance for California's disabled veterans by offering veterans the opportunity to gain experience in and provide resources by which disabled veterans could pursue the establishment of their own businesses with the same opportunities available to minority-owned businesses. Soon thereafter, Walter Mischler, then a senior manager for a regional securities brokerage in Southern California whose earlier career path began as a graduate of the United States Military Academy, and who then served two tours in the Vietnam War before sustaining injuries that led to his receiving a service-disabled certification, was determined to create his own investment firm and leverage the resources and opportunities provided to service-disabled veterans under recent state, and soon thereafter, federal legislation. In 1994, under Walt Mischler's leadership, The Mischler Financial Group became the very first minority broker-dealer to be owned and operated by service-disabled veterans and the soon after, became the first federally-certified SDV-owned business enterprise operating within the financial services industry. Since its formation, the firm has grown from its role as a small boutique firm with five employees operating out of a Newport Beach office to employing more than 50 financial industry professionals with offices in five major US cities. The firm is committed to mentoring service-disabled veterans as they seek roles within the private sector as well as the financial services industry, advocates on behalf of multiple organizations that promote opportunities and support for the service-disabled veteran community, and is dedicated to hiring qualified veterans for roles within the firm when opportunities arise. 20% of the firm's employees are service-disabled veterans, including Walt Mischler, the founder/chairman emeritus, and Dean Chamberlain, the firm's CEO and principal. In November 2018, Mischler entered into a strategic partnership with GTS Securities, the NYSE largest Designated Market-Maker and multi-asset electronic market-maker. That arrangement included GTS making an equity investment in Mischler where GTS becomes a minority stake-holder. In 2019, Mischler expand its company's cash management capabilities and market fund to be led by La-Yona Rauls and Christopher Walsh. Management Walter Mischler Walter Mischler is the founder and chairman emeritus of Mischler Financial Group. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and served as an infantry officer for the United States Army during the Vietnam War. After sustaining combat injuries that led to his service-disabled veteran certification and leaving the military, Mischler worked in sales for companies like Procter & Gamble, Squibb Pharmaceutical, and Black & Decker. Mischler was working for Liberty Capital Markets Inc. as an account executive when he learned of California's Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise (DVBE) Program, and left his job to start his own business and Mischler Financial Group was created in 1994. Dean Chamberlain Dean Chamberlain is the chief executive officer and principal of Mischler Financial Group and has served in this role since January 2013. Chamberlain is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he received a Bachelor of Science Degree in mechanical engineering management, and thereafter he served 6 years as an officer in the U.S. Army before he sustained injuries in the line of duty that led to his being certified as service-disabled. He then received a master's degree in business administration from J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. Prior to being appointed CEO of Mischler Financial Group in 2013, Chamberlain's Wall Street career included senior roles for leading investment banks. Immediately prior to joining Mischler Financial Group, Chamberlain worked for Nomura Securities International, Inc. from 2005 to 2011, where he held many positions, including the head of fixed income for Americas and managing director and deputy head of fixed income. Prior to his employment at Nomura Securities, Chamberlain worked for the Bank of America Securities LLC managing the Midwest distribution of mortgage-related and structured products. Doyle Holmes Doyle Holmes is the president and chief operating officer at the Mischler Financial Group. Holmes attended Golden Gate University in San Francisco, California, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration. Holmes has had a lot of experience working in leadership positions in the financial industry. Holmes has worked as the president and CEO for Liberty Monetary Services, president and CEO for Liberty Capital Markets and managing director of fixed income for Gilford Securities, Inc. Holmes worked at Gilford Securities, Inc. until 1996, when he left to work at Mischler Financial Group. Philanthropy Mischler Financial Group committed to not only hiring and training qualified service-disabled veterans, the firm is committed to giving back to the veteran and SDV community. Mischler Financial Group has advocated SDV legislation since introduced in various States and has helped raise millions of dollars and directly donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Service-Disabled Veteran support programs including, among others, Wounded Warrior Project, The Fisher House Foundation, The Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation, Bob Woodruff Foundation, and Lead The Way Fund. Investment banking presence Thanks in part to Mischler Financial Group's minority designation, coupled with the capital markets capabilities the firm's management and employees, many of whom are also service-disabled veterans, and who before joining Mischler had previously served in senior capital markets roles for the financial industry's premiere investment firms, Mischler has established a notable presence across the primary debthttps://mischlerfinancial.com/mischler-capital-market-services-disabled- veteran-owned-broker-dealer/debt-capital-market-fixed-income-minority-broker- dealer/ and equities capital markets.https://mischlerfinancial.com/mischler- capital-market-services-disabled-veteran-owned-broker-dealer/equity-capital- markets/ Mischler has played a role as underwriting manager, co-manager and or selling group member on behalf of dozens of Fortune corporations in the course of their issuing billions of dollars of new debt and equity issuance.

Seen as the opposite of helicopter parenting, the idea was popularized by pediatrician Benjamin Spock. A notable text of the movement is Lenore Skenazy's book Free-Range Kids: Giving Our Children the Freedom We Had Without Going Nuts with Worry (2009).  Overview  Hoping to enhance psychoanalysis in the pediatric world, Spock authored a book called The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care. The book, which was released in 1946 and soon became a best seller, encouraged free-range parenting with the hopes of implementing Freudian philosophy into child- rearing. American journalist Lenore Skenazy has written about the problems of overparenting and overprotection of kids with a particular emphasis on allowing kids to have appropriate levels of freedom and responsibility for their age while still keeping them safe. Her book, Free Range Kids: Giving Our Children the Freedom We Had without Going Nuts with Worry and her related website (April 2008) describe what she sees as the horrors of mainstream schooling, parenting, and organised activities, highlighting the unnecessary protection from risk that limits children's opportunity to mature properly into independent adults, and the unnecessary training, even in using flash cards for preschoolers, thereby limiting their opportunities for personal growth.  Legal status in the United States Restrictions In the United States, free-range parenting is limited by laws in many states restricting children's autonomy, such as how old a child must be to walk to school alone. In Massachusetts, such issues are generally addressed on a case- by-case basis. Other states, such as Delaware, or Colorado, based on states' child labor laws, will investigate reports of any child under the age of 12 being left alone, whereas other states, like North Carolina, have fire laws that stipulate a child under 8 should not be left home alone. Only three states specify a minimum age for leaving a child home alone. These include Illinois which requires children to be 14 years old, in Maryland, the minimum age is 8, and in Oregon 10.Maryland parent investigation raises issue: What age to allow children 'free range' to walk, stay home alone?

In 2014 and 2015, parents in Maryland were investigated by their local Child Protective Services when their children walked home from a park unsupervised. In December 2015, however, new federal law contained an amendment added by Sen. Mike Lee stating that: :...nothing in this Act shall...prohibit a child from traveling to and from school on foot or by car, bus, or bike when the parents of the child have given permission; or expose parents to civil or criminal charges for allowing their child to responsibly and safely travel to and from school by a means the parents believe is age appropriate. A caveat adds, \\"...nothing in this section 10 shall be construed to preempt State or local laws.\\" Legal protections In 2018, Utah became the first state to enact legislation which explicitly protected parents' right to \\"free range\\" their children.  Legal status in Canada  There is no legal consensus about when parents can leave their children unsupervised in Canada.Ruiz-Casares, M., & Radic I. (2015). Legal Age for Leaving Children Unsupervised Across Canada. CWRP Information Sheet #144E. Montreal, QC: McGill University, Centre for Research on Children and Families However, according to section 218 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a person who \\"unlawfully abandons or exposes a child who is under the age of ten years, so that its life is or is likely to be endangered or its health is or is likely to be permanently injured\\" commits a criminal offence. Each province is responsible for its legal framework. Red Cross Canada is offering a training course for children between the age of 9 and 13 (Stay Safe!) to improve their capacity to respond to an emergency case if they stay home alone, suggesting that parents use their own discretion when it comes to their own individual children. The Red Cross babysitting course targets the 11 to 15 years old, suggesting at this age children are able to supervise younger children effectively and safely. In Ontario, the law is very vague concerning the age at which children might be left alone. Parents are responsible for their children until they are 16 years old but it does not mean that they should be under constant parental supervision. While a staying home age is not specified, parents are not permitted to leave their children unattended in vehicles.

On May 26, 2006 Mexico requested consultations with the United States about a number of final anti-dumping judgments made by the US Department of Commerce. The judgments concerned the imports of stainless steel sheets and strips from Mexico, which were supposedly illegal dumping through the use of a \\"Zeroing\\" technique by the US Department of Commerce. Mexico believed that some of the laws, regulations, administrative practices and methodologies implemented by the US impaired and nullified the benefits added to Mexico, directly or indirectly, under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Customs Valuation, and that the anti-dumping laws were unwarranted. The consultations were held to discuss activities carried on between January 1999 and June 2004. This led to a panel being established in December 2006, the proceedings of which continued until May 2013, with a mutually agreeable solution being reached. Japan asked to join the consultation in June 2006.  Products in question  Stainless steel, specifically in the form of sheets and coils, was at the center of the dispute. Stainless steel is an alloy containing at least 10.2% chromium.  The complaint  On May 26, 2006 Mexico asked for an audience with the US concerning Anti-Dumping laws for stainless steel sheet and coils imported from Mexico to the US from t1999 o 2004. The consultations concerned: * The statement of Administrative Action that corresponded with Uruguay Round Agreements Act * Title 19 of the US Code of Federal Regulations of the US Department of Commerce regulations * The 1997 edition of the Import Administration Anti-dumping Manual * The method employed by the US department of Commerce to decide the space of dumping for the original product under investigation, which allowed the department to disregard negative dumping margins (a practice called to as \\"Zeroing\\". Mexico believed that these laws and practices violated their rights under the World Trade Organization agreement and argued that no dumping was taking place. Specifically, Mexico stated that the US laws were inconsistent with: * Articles VI:1 and VI:2 of the GATT 1994 * Articles 1, 2.1, 2.4, 2.4.2, 5, 6.10, 9 (including 9.3, but not limited to it), 11, 18 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement * Article XVI:4 of the World Trade Organization agreement  Panel history and decisions  On October 12, 2006, Mexico requested the production of a panel, which the dispute settlement body established on October 26, 2006. On December 20, 2006, the Director General finalized the panel's membership. In May 2007, the Chairman of the panel informed the dispute settlement body that the panel would not be able to complete the work until November 2007 due to scheduling conflicts. On December 20, 2007, the panel report was published to all members. The panel concluded that the Zeroing Model used by the US department of commerce was not agreed with the Anti-Dumping Agreement. On the other hand, it also concluded that Simple Zeroing in periodic review was not inconsistent with the Anti Dumping Agreement. Mexico was thus only partially satisfied with the results of their complaint to the World Trade Organization. On January 31, 2008, Mexico notified the appellate body that it would like to appeal some of the issues of law covered in the panel report, and that it wished to cover some of the legal interpretations covered by the panel. On March 26, 2008 the chairman of the appellate body informed the dispute settlement body that the 60-day period would not be sufficient to finalize the report. On April 30, 2008, the appellate report was circulated to the Members. The new decision reversed the previous panel‚Äôs decision stating that Simple Zeroing in periodic review was not in violation of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and reversed the ruling that the US was not in compliance with the Anti-Dumping Agreement. For the purposes of resolving the dispute, the panel also found it unnecessary to make an additional finding on Mexico‚Äôs claim that Simple Zeroing in periodic review (as applied to the five periodic reviews at issue in the dispute) was inconsistent with the Anti-Dumping Laws. Additionally, the new decision did not find that the previous panel failed to discharge its duties. As a result, the appellate body recommended to the dispute settlement body that the United States bring the issues and practices found to be inconsistent with the anti- dumping agreement, into conformity with the obligations standing under the agreement. On May 20, 2008 the dispute settlement body adopted the appellate body and the panel reports.  Post-ruling and implementation  On June 2, 2008, at the dispute settlement body meeting, the United States notified the dispute settlement body that it intended to comply with the World Trade Organization obligations and requested a reasonable period of time to start implementation. After the lengthy process of appointing of an arbitrator, a decision was made on October 31, 2008 that the United States would have 11 months and ten days from the adoption of the Panel to implement the recommendations and rulings made by the appellate body. The reasonable time period expired on April 30, 2009. On May 18, 2009, Mexico and the United States informed the dispute settlement body of an agreement regarding procedures. The next day, Japan requested to join the consultations. On September 7, 2010 Mexico requested the establishment of a compliance panel. After a number of years of work with the compliance panel, on May 31, 2012, Mexico requested that any work be suspended until further notice. The panel agreed to the request. On May 6, 2013 the panel circulated a report to the members, in which the panel had reached the conclusion that the two parties had reached a mutually satisfactory solution on April 8, 2013. As the case was settled and closed the panel issued a report that was limited to a brief description of the case and the statement of the conclusion.

Design and development Between 1919 and 1922 Caudron built a series of multi-engined civil passenger transport biplanes of similar design but increasing size and engine power, the C.33, C.37, C.39, C.43 and C.61. The C.33 was the only twin engined aircraft in the series and the smallest in span and passenger capacity, while the others had three or five engines. Rather than being a small airliner taking paying passengers, the Landaulet Monsieur- Madame was intended as the equivalent of a chauffeur driven car carrying a couple and one other member of the household, as its name suggested. The C.33 was a three bay biplane with fabric covered, rectangular plan wings mounted without stagger. Only the shorter lower wings had dihedral, which began outboard of the engines. The wings were joined by vertical pairs of interplane struts, the forward members attached near the leading edges, and the centre section was supported by similar, shorter cabane struts from the upper forward fuselage. Each inner bay was defined by two close pairs of parallel interplane struts, supporting a 60 kW (80 hp) Le Rh√¥ne 9C nine cylinder rotary engine between them, about halfway between the wings. Each wing mounted engine was in a long, tapered cowling, open at the rear. Fuel was held in wedge shaped tanks within the cowlings, their horizontal rear edges visible from behind. Each held . Both upper and lower wings carried ailerons, which were not balanced. The fuselage of the C.33 was rectangular in section. Two open cockpits were located in tandem in the wedge shaped nose. A passenger sat in front with the pilot behind. Behind the pilot there was an enclosed cabin, with a window on each side and a port side door. It contained a pair of upholstered wicker chairs mounted on swivels. Behind the wings the fuselage tapered gently to a broad, triangular fin which carried a vertical edged balanced rudder that reached down to the keel. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage so its elevators had a notch for rudder movement. The C.37 had a fixed tailskid undercarriage. There were pairs of main wheels mounted on single axles attached at their centre to a longitudinal bar held under the engine at each end on short, forward raked V-struts. The Landaulet Monsieur-Madame probably first flew late in 1919 or early in the next year. It was on display at the Paris Aero Show of 1919, though possibly unflown. Two appeared on the French civil register, remaining on it until 1931.

History  Amos Winter, a PhD graduate from MIT, travelled to Tanzania during his work, and found that conventional wheelchairs are inadequate in areas without wheelchair accessible roads and buildings. He and his students from his mechanical engineering class worked together on the development of the project. The tests of the LFC were conducted in East Africa, Guatemala and India.  Description  In addition to a normal wheelchair push rim, the wheelchair had a lever drivetrain that let the user grip the lever far from the wheel for high torque on rough terrain. The levers could be removed and stored on the chair, allowing it to be used like a normal wheelchair indoors. The wheelchairs were designed to be produced at low cost from commonly available bicycle parts, and to be repaired and maintained at local bicycle shops. The chair was developed by a group called Global Research Innovation & Technology. The chair was sold at around US $250 to NGOs--less than the price of common wheelchairs. The LFC made way for the GRIT Freedom Chair, an improved all-terrain wheelchair designed for the developed world. The initial version of the Freedom Chair product launched on Kickstarter with a lowest price point of US$2,195, which sold out.

The poem, hailing the 150-million-strong Russian people's mission in starting the world revolution (represented here as an allegorical battle of Russian Ivan and the American president Woodrow Wilson, the embodiment of the capitalist evil) failed to impress the Soviet revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin who apparently saw in it little but a pretentious Futuristic experiment. History Mayakovsky conceived and started writing the poem in the first half of 1919 and completed it in March 1920. Among its several working titles were \\"The Will of the Millions\\" (–í–æ–ª—è –º–∏–ª–ª–∏–æ–Ω–æ–≤), \\"The Tale of Ivan\\" (–ë—ã–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –æ–± –ò–≤–∞–Ω–µ) and \\"Ivan The Bylina.

On 5 March 1920 Mayakovsky recited fragments of the poem at the event celebrating the opening of the All-Russian Union of Poets Club in Moscow. He read it in full on the 4th and the 20th of December of the same year, at the Petrograd House of Arts and Polytechnic Museum in Moscow, respectively.Makarov, V., Zakharov, A., Kosovan, I. Commentaries to 150 000 000. The Works by Vladimir Mayakovsky in 6 volumes. Ogonyok Library. Pravda Publishers. Moscow, 1973. Vol.II, p. 567 The poem first appeared in fragments in Khudozhestvennoye Slovo (Artistic Word) magazine's October 1920 issue. As a separate edition it came out in April 1921, published by Gosizdat (GIZ) without the name of the author mentioned. The reason for this anonymity was explained in the poem's first two stanzas: \\"150 millions is the name of this poem's master / Bullet is rhythm, flame's a rhyme jumping from house to house. / 150 millions speak through my mouth / Masses marching over the stepping-stone paper is the offset duplicator machine getting these pages printed. // Who'd enquire the Moon and the Sun of what makes them bring out day and night, who‚Äôd demand the name of creator genius? / The same's with this poem: it hasn't got one single author.\\"150 000 000.

Published it anonymously, so that everyone could add things and improve it. Nobody did, everybody knew the name of the author anyway. Well, whatever. Now it comes out with my name on,\\" Mayakovsky commented in I, Myself autobiography (\\"Year 1920\\" chapter). Reception Anatoly Lunacharsky (right) championed the poem which Vladimir Lenin (left) dismissed as \\"pretentious and dodgy.\\" Mayakovsky's public recitals in Moscow and Petrograd had great success, but in higher places the publication caused controversy. Vladimir Lenin, for whom Mayakovsky was just \\"one of those Futurists\\" (whom he reviled) was outraged with the fact that Gosizdat printed 5 thousand copies of the poem which he found \\"pretentious and dodgy.\\"Lunacharsky, A.V.

On 6 May 1921 in the course of one of the Soviet government's meetings Lenin forwarded a note to Lunacharsky: \\"You should be ashamed of yourself, having supported the printing of 5 thousand copies of Mayakovsky's 150 000 000. Its nonsensical, utterly silly and pretentious. I reckon no more than 1 of 10 books of this ilk should be published, and in 1500 copies maximum, for libraries and oddballs who enjoy reading such things. You, Lunacharsky, should be caned for your Futurism. Lenin.\\" On the flip side of the paper there is Lunacharsky's written reply: \\"For me personally this particular thing holds little appeal. But ‚Äì 1) no lesser poet than Brysov expressed his delight and demanded for 20 000 [copies] to be printed, 2) the poem, as recited by its author, had great success - mind you, with the workers' audience.\\" Indeed, in August 1920 Bryusov sent a letter to the Gosizdat leadership: \\"The board of directors of the Narkompros' Literary and Publishing Department (–õ–ò–¢–û) received the manuscript of c(omrade) Mayakovsky's 150 Millions, found the poem extremely important from the propagandistic point of view and suggests that it should be published as soon as possible.\\"The Complete V.V.Mayakovsky, 1939, vol.VI, pp. 352‚Äî353. Lenin, obviously dissatisfied with Lunacharsky's reply, sent to Gosizdat's director M.N.Pokrovsky a similar note, demanding that the publication of the works by \\"those Futurists\\" should be curtailed. The note ended with the question: \\"Would it be possible for us to find some reliable anti-Futurists?\\" There is evidence, though, that Lenin still professed some interest to Mayakovsky's poetry, at least occasionally. According to the Soviet literary historian E. Naumov, there is one \\"still unpublished verbatim account of one of the disputes under the Lunacharsky's chairmanship, concerning the Left Front of the Arts (LEF). The Gosizdat director N.L.Meshcheryakov, having credited the LEF writers with supporting the revolution, added: \\"I recall one curious episode. After his poem's 150 000 000s release, Mayakovsky took one copy, wrote upon its cover: \\"To Comrade Vladimir Ilyich with our ComFut greetings, Vladimir Mayakovsky\\" and sent it. Lenin, a lively, open and curious man, upon reading it, commented: \\"But it's an intriguing kind of literature, you know. It represents one very special brand of communism. It's the hooligan communism.\\" Plot Ivan defeats Wilson. Illustration by I.Staroselsky Driven by hunger, rage and hatred for the hostile outside world, people of Russia leave their homes to march all over the land, joined by animals, machines and even whole gubernias, all merging into one sweeping force, intent on \\"doing this old romantic world in.\\" In Chicago, a monstrously rich wonder-city, the world revolution's worst enemy Woodrow Wilson abides in a giant hotel, sporting a bowler-hat \\"higher than Sukharev Tower.\\" Among his servants Adelina Patti, Fyodor Chalyapin and Ilya Mechnikov are notable. The rumor of a storm coming from the Pacific spreads among the people of Chicago, sunbathing on the ocean beach. Soon it transpires that the reason behind this cataclysm is mysterious Ivan's approaching them, walking on water. Wilson makes a decision to confront the enemy face to face, gets all of his fat turned into muscles by some magic ointment and arms himself with revolvers and a 70-blade sabre. The world gets divided into two: half of it joins Ivan (in fact, merges with him, physically), the other half runs away for Wilson's protection. Ivan steps upon the beach without having wetted his feet, and challenges Wilson, now clad in armory, for a showdown. The \\"World Class Struggle Championship Final\\" takes place on Chicago's central square. Wilson strikes first and slashed armless Ivan, but out of the wound, instead of blood, peoples, machines, gubernias, et cetera start to pour out to attack the old world. Wilson, sieged in his palace, spreads out famine, diseases and, worst of all, \\"ideas\\" to ward the enemy off, but to no avail. He dies, gets \\"scorched out\\" and the rejoicing world marches into the Future, ruled by \\"a genius Cain.\\" A hundred years on, and everybody (the visiting Martians included) is celebrating the victory, remembering \\"the Revolution's bloody Ilyad.\\"  References  1921 poems Poetry by Vladimir Mayakovsky ","title":"150 000 000"},{"id":"46530111","text":"The Awolowo v.

Origin and education Friedrich-Wend was the oldest surviving son of Philip, Prince of Eulenburg (1847‚Äì1921) and his wife Augusta, born Countess of Sandels (1853‚Äì1941), daughter of Samuel, the last Count of Sandels, and Augusta of Tersmeden. On account of his father's diplomatic duties he spent his childhood and school days in Starnberg, Oldenburg, Stuttgart and Vienna. On attaining his Abitur, Friedrich-Wend joined the 1st Guards Infantry Division in 1902 and a year later the Kriegsschule in Engers. In 1906 he withdrew from the military with the rank of Lieutenant of Reserves. During his time in Vienna he had met his later wife, the Austrian Marie von Mayr-Melnhof (1884 -1960). Marie came from the family of the Barons of Mayr von Melnhof that had risen in society very rapidly some decades before; having been the peasants Mayr of the Melnhof, they succeeded in paving the way for the industrialisation of Styria, and thus acquired a vast fortune. This fortune was invested in large areas of forestry and formed the basis of the Mayr- Melnhof company today. Marriage, the Harden-Eulenburg affair and World War I Wedding of Friedrich-Wend and Marie took place on 21 My 1904 at Liebenberg in the presence of the Emperor Wilhelm II. Because of the bride's Catholic confession, it had been a problematic union, as Wilhelm II had elevated his friend Philip zu Eulenberg to the rank of prince just a few years earlier in an attempt to create parity between the Catholic and Protestant peers of the empire. The impending marriage appeared to threaten this equilibrium, whereupon Wilhelm at first forbade it. The Emperor himself thereupon sought a solution by asking Pope Pius X to grant an exception. This led to the marriage being celebrated in both confessions and all the children were later baptised in the Protestant faith. Immediately thereafter, between 1904 and 1906 the so- called Lake House, was built for the young couple on the shores of a lake close to the family estate, the costs being met by the bridal dowry. After his wedding, Friedrich-Wend set out on a course of agricultural studies at the University of Halle, that he was, however, unable to complete. The dramatic events of Harden-Eulenburg affair involving his father in the period between 1907 and 1909 made it necessary for him to be present with his family, for the two older sons were often called upon to physically protect their father from the surge of Paparazzi. The family doctor, Wilhelm zur Linden, writes in his memoirs that he was still treating the after-effects of the shock in Friedrich-Wend in the year 1937.Wilhelm zur Linden: Blick durchs Prisma ‚Äì Lebensbericht eine Arztes. Vittorio Klostermann, Frankfurt 1963, S. 47‚Äì51. So at the age of 26, Friedrich-Wend took over full responsibility for the family affairs, erecting a brickworks the following year and beginning with the mechanisation of the agricultural estate. In the course of the general mobilisation, he was called for active service in August 1914. His regiment advanced through Belgium and reached Ghent during the offensive, after which he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st. Class. Soon after this he was poisoned by locals. For months he could only take in fluids and only regained his health after many years. In June 1915 his younger brother, Botho Sigwart fell in Galicia when a shot pierced his lung. His death brought considerable consequences for the family, who had been close to Rudolf Steiner and received him as guest at Liebenberg estate occasionally since 1906. Sigwart had been an avid student of Anthroposophy together with two of his sisters, Tora and Lyki and with his sister-in-law, Marie, the wife of Friedrich-Wend. Soon after he died, they felt he was trying to communicate with them from the world beyond, made extensive notes and showed these to Rudolf Steiner. The three volumes Bridge Over the River give an account of these communications.Bridge Across the River translated by Joseph Bailey After the First World War, things changed considerably also for the circumstances at Liebenberg, which was no longer competitive. Friedrich-Wend, heir to the title after the death of his father in 1921, engaged an external consultant in 1925, Rudolf, Baron of Engelhardt-Sch√∂nheyden, under whose management the estate was successfully upgraded. In 1926 Engelhardt married the daughter of his employer, Ingeborg, Countess zu Eulenburg and moved with her into one wing of the Lake House. The family under the Nazi regime As a monarchist, Eulenburg was a member of and involved with the conservative German National People's Party (DNVP). He soon realised, however, that the influence of the large landowners could only be maintained if they had broad basis of support amongst the masses. He saw in the Nazi Party (NSDAP), that had already outdistanced the DNVP during the 1930 elections, a political force that could secure this broad popular consent. He therefore met with Adolf Hitler in 1931 in order to address the interests of the big landowners: :\\"In order to clarify this question I decided to seek out Adolf Hitler personally in order to hear directly out of his mouth what we could expect from him.\\"Stefan M√ºller: Liebenberg ‚Äì Ein verkauftes Dorf. Im Selbstverlag BoD, 2003, S. 61 After this conversation, Friedrich-Wend believed to have found in Hitler the right man to secure his aims. He thereupon wrote to the other landowners so as to encourage them to join the NSDAP: :\\"If we do not wish to embrace Bolshevism we have no other choice but to enter into this party which, despite many socialist ideas, is the counter- pole of Marxism and Bolshevism.\\"Stefan M√ºller, op. cit., S. 61 He became a member of the party himself and the bulk of the population of Liebenberg later followed his example. His son-in-law, Baron von Engelhardt, had already some years earlier founded a Liebenberg branch of the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), organising field games and battle exercises. The Eulenburg's neighbour on the next estate was Hermann G√∂ring, who had built a country residence, Carinhall in the Schorfheide forest nearby. He would at times join the deer hunting on the Liebenberg estate. It was during one of these stays at Liebenberg that the niece of Eulenburg, Libertas Schulze-Boysen, who had spent the decisive years of her childhood with the family at Liebenberg, spoke to G√∂ring on behalf of her fianc√©, Harro Schulze-Boysen. He was in a subordinate position in G√∂ring's Reichsluftfahrtministerium, the Ministry of Aviation, and shortly after this he was promoted. The couple were married in 1936 at Liebenberg. Six years later, Harro and Libertas were identified as the heads of the resistance group Rote Kapelle, by the Gestapo and executed in December 1942 at Pl√∂tzensee Prison.Peter Steinbach und Johannes Tuchel: Lexikon des Widerstandes 1933‚Äì1945. C.H. Beck; 2. √ºberarb. u. erw. Auflage, 1998, S. 178f In reaction, the only son of Friedrich-Wend, Wend, Count of Eulenburg (1908‚Äì1986), who had up to that point been classified as \\"u.K.\\" (indispensable), at once received his call-up papers to a Strafbattalion (penal battalion), unit that experienced an extraordinarily high rate of casualties, and was sent to the Eastern Front to combat partisans. His father continued ceaselessly to attempt to secure his transfer and Wend eventually was moved into a tank battalion that was completely wiped out during the Allied invasion of Salerno. He survived the war and was taken prisoner in April 1945 by American troops near Como. Prior to this, in 1941, Prince Eulenburg had already drawn the attention of the Nazi authorities when he signed a petition calling for the release of the priests of the Christian Community, who had been arrested as a body by the Gestapo on 10 June 1941, the churches prohibited and their property confiscated. Other notable signatories to the petition were the operatic soprano, Marta Fuchs, the two marine captains Helmuth von Ruckteschell and Hans Erdmenger together with his wife, as well as a few officials from some of the ministries. The priests had been released from captivity some two months later, but the signatories' names had been noted by the Gestapo.Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus (1933‚Äì1945) Uwe Werner, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag 24. M√§rz 1999 P. 440 Fleeing to West Germany, rebuilding and death Friedrich-Wend and his wife fled in April 1945 as the last of the family to leave Liebenberg right before the invasion of the Red Army troops. They spent the next years on their estate of Gut Kaden in Schleswig-Holstein while the Soviet military administration of Germany confiscated their properties in Liebenberg and H√§sen. The family estates of Hertefeld and Kolk, as well as the forestry and hunting estates of his wife Marie in Austria were either destroyed or occupied by refugees. By 1947 Friedrich Wend had once again built up the revenue administration of the main estate, Hertefeld, while his son Wend re-established the agricultural concerns. When the last refugees had left the estate in Hinterstoder, Upper Austria the family could once again take possession of it. Prince Eulenburg devoted the last years of his life to his family and to the hunt until his death on 1 August 1963 at Hertefeld, where he lies buried next to his wife, Marie, who had preceded him in 1961.

He played a central role in the events that followed the assassination of al-Mutawakkil in 861, known as the Anarchy at Samarra. During this period he and his ally Bugha al-Sharabi were often in effective control of affairs in the capital, and were responsible for the downfall of several caliphs and rival officials. After Wasif was killed in 867, his position was inherited by his son Salih.  Early life  Map of Samarra. Wasif and his followers were originally given grants adjacent to al-Hayr, and subsequently moved to al-Matira Wasif was originally a slave (ghulam) and was owned by the Nu'man family in Baghdad, where he worked as an armorer. At some point he was purchased by the future caliph al-Mu'tasim (r. 833‚Äì842), and he soon rose to prominence as a member of the Abbasids' new Turkish corps.; When al-Mu'tasim decided to move his capital to Samarra in 836, Wasif and his followers were settled in the new city, having received land allotments adjacent to al-Hayr. In 838 Wasif participated in al-Mu'tasim's Amorium campaign, and is mentioned as commanding the caliph's advance guard as they passed through the Gates of Tarsus. According to al-Ya'qubi, Wasif also served as al-Mu'tasim's chamberlain (hajib). During the caliphate of al-Wathiq (r. 842‚Äì847), Wasif was granted the Samarran cantonment of al-Matira, which had formerly been in the possession of the disgraced general al-Afshin.; In 846 he undertook an expedition to the areas of Isfahan, al-Jibal and Fars, where he attempted to stop a band of Kurds from infiltrating the region.; After al- Wathiq died in 847, Wasif and other high-ranking officers and court officials met to choose his successor. The group eventually agreed to select al- Mutawakkil, and Wasif was among the first to render the oath of allegiance to the new caliph.; ; During al-Mutawakkil's reign (847‚Äì861), Wasif was appointed as chamberlain.; ; The caliph also entrusted Wasif's sister Su'ad with the guardianship of his son al-Mu'ayyad.;  Assassination of al- Mutawakkil, caliphate of al-Muntasir  Al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by members of his Turkish bodyguard in December 861. Wasif was not a member of the assassination team, but he was a central figure in the plot. Al-Tabari claims that the conspiracy was hatched after al-Mutawakkil ordered Wasif's estates in Isfahan and al-Jibal to be seized in favour of al-Fath ibn Khaqan, and that the caliph had been plotting to kill Wasif and Bugha al-Sharabi, forcing the conspirators to strike against him first. For his part, Wasif was aware of the plan and sent five of his sons, including Salih ibn Wasif, to assist the assassins.; Al-Mutawakkil's death resulted in his eldest son al- Muntasir becoming caliph. During his short reign (861‚Äì862), Wasif and Bugha urged the caliph to cancel his father's succession arrangements and depose al- Muntasir's brothers al-Mu'tazz and al-Mu'ayyad from their position as his heirs. The Turks feared that if al-Mu'tazz became caliph, he would seek revenge for al-Mutawakkil's death and eliminate them. They eventually convinced al-Muntasir to force his brothers to abdicate, and instead declare his own son as his successor. In early 862 Wasif was appointed by the caliph to undertake a major campaign on the Byzantine frontier. The decision to select Wasif was allegedly the work of the vizier Ahmad ibn al-Khasib, a political rival who sought to remove the general from Samarra. Wasif seems to have had no objection to the assignment and led a large force to the frontier, where he captured a fortress from the Byzantines.; ;  Disorder in Samarra, outbreak of civil war  While on campaign at the frontier, Wasif learned of the death of al-Muntasir in June 862, and that a cabal of Turkish officers, including Bugha, had selected al-Musta'in (r. 862‚Äì866) to succeed him. Being unable to play any role in the selection process, Wasif decided to continue with the expedition for a time, but by the next year he had returned to Samarra. During the first year of al-Musta'in's reign, the administration was dominated by his vizier Utamish. When the latter attempted to exclude Wasif and Bugha from power, however, the two officers retaliated by inciting the army against him. This strategy eventually succeeded and Utamish was killed by the mawlas in June 863. Following his death, Wasif and Bugha each received new powers; Wasif was made governor of al-Ahwaz and Bugha was appointed over Palestine.; Wasif subsequently also became al-Musta'in's administrative assistant, while his secretary became vizier.; In early 865, Wasif and Bugha ordered the killing of Baghir al-Turki, an officer who had been plotting against them. Baghir, however, was popular with the Turkish soldiers, and a riot broke out when news of his fate became known. Seeing that they were unable to regain control, Wasif, Bugha and al-Musta'in departed from Samarra and made their way to Baghdad, where they were welcomed by its governor Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah ibn Tahir. The Turkish soldiers, seeing that the caliph had abandoned them, decided to depose al-Musta'in and swear allegiance to al- Mu'tazz instead, and an army was dispatched to attack Baghdad.; ; Over the course of the next year, central Iraq was the site of fighting between the Samarran Turks and forces loyal to al-Musta'in. Wasif and Bugha stayed by the caliph and participated in battles to defend Baghdad, although overall command of al-Musta'in's war effort was in the hands of Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah.; ; By the end of 865, however, hopes for an al-Musta'in victory had diminished, and Wasif, Bugha and Muhammad decided to force the caliph to surrender and abdicate, which he did in January 866. They also negotiated with al-Mu'tazz's forces to bring an end to the war. As part of the agreement, Wasif and Bugha were promised new positions; Wasif was to be appointed over al-Jibal and Bugha was to become governor of the Hijaz.;  Under al-Mu'tazz  Following the victory of al-Mu'tazz, Wasif and Bugha initially remained in Baghdad. The new caliph, however, initially took a hostile attitude toward the two officers, and ordered Muhammad to drop their names, together with those they had registered, from the diwans. When Wasif and Bugha discovered in April 866 that one of Muhammad's deputies had been contracted to kill them, they went on the defensive, gathering their troops, purchasing weapons and distributing funds in their neighborhoods. Wasif and Bugha then called on their allies to pressure al-Mu'tazz to restore them to favor. Wasif bribed al-Mu'ayyad to speak positively to the caliph about him, while Abu Ahmad ibn al-Mutawakkil spoke on Bugha's behalf. The Turkish soldiers also favored allowing them to return to Samarra. In October 866 they received an invitation from the caliph to come to the capital, and they accordingly set out for the city. In the following month, al-Mu'tazz restored them to the positions that they had held prior to their departure to Baghdad.; ; After their return to Samarra, Wasif and Bugha resumed their administrative duties. Wasif ordered the repair of the Mecca Road and put Abu al-Saj Dewdad in charge of the project. He also appointed the Dulafid 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn Abu Dulaf as his deputy governor in al-Jibal, and sent him cloaks signifying his appointment.  Death  On October 29, 867, the Turkish soldiers, together with the Ushrusaniyya and Faraghina regiments, rioted, demanding four months of their allotments. Bugha, Wasif and Sima al-Sharabi went out with a hundred of their followers and attempted to defuse the situation. Wasif told the rioters that there was no money to pay them, at which point Bugha and Sima decided to depart. The rioters then attacked Wasif, slashing and stabbing him. He was then taken to a nearby residence, but the soldiers dragged him out and struck him with axes until they broke both his arms and decapitated him, and his head was placed on top of a stick.; ; ; Following Wasif's death, al-Mu'tazz entrusted Bugha with Wasif's duties. Wasif's son Salih also became an influential figure in Samarra until he was killed in 870.; ;  Notes   References   867 deaths Generals of the Abbasid Caliphate 9th- century Turkic people Deaths by decapitation ","title":"Wasif al-Turki"},{"id":"46530257","text":"Lonnie Hosey (born December 1, 1946) is an American politician.

H. Chamberlin (bottom) The 1911 modernism controversy at Brigham Young University was an episode involving four professors at Brigham Young University (BYU), who between 1908 and 1911 widely taught evolution and higher criticism of the Bible, arguing that modern scientific thought was compatible with Christian and Mormon theology. The professors were popular among students and the community but their teachings concerned administrators, and drew complaints from stake presidents, eventually resulting in the resignation of all four faculty members, an event that \\"leveled a serious blow to the academic reputation of Brigham Young University‚Äîone from which the Mormon school did not fully recover until successive presidential administrations.\\"Bowen, Craig H. (1995). Academic Freedom and the Utah Controversies of 1911 and 1915. Unpublished Master's thesis, J. Willard Marriott Library Special Collections, University of Utah, Salt Lake City. History In 1907, BYU president George H. Brimhall began hiring a new group of faculty to increase the academic reputation of his school. Joseph Peterson was hired to teach psychology, and his brother Henry Peterson hired as the director of the College of Education. Joseph Peterson was the first Ph.D on the faculty of BYU. In 1908 and 1909 Brimhall hired Ralph Vary Chamberlin and his brother William Henry Chamberlin, to teach biology and philosophy, respectively. The Chamberlin and Peterson brothers, while devout Mormons, actively sought to increase the intellectual atmosphere of the university and community, facilitating discussion and debates on evolution and the Bible, and sought to convey that evolutionary ideas and Mormon theology were not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. Horace H. Cummings, the superintendent of the church schools, felt especially that teaching religion from non-Mormon sources and teaching evolution was contrary to Latter-Day Saint teachings. The four instructors' courses were popular among students and other faculty, but university and church officials accused the professors of promoting heretical views, and in 1911 offered the Petersons and Ralph Chamberlin a choice: alter their teachings or lose their jobs.Bowen, Craig H. (1995). cademic Freedom and the Utah Controversies of 1911 and 1915. Unpublished Master's thesis, J. Willard Marriott Library Special Collections, University of Utah, Salt Lake City. Privately, Joseph B. Keeler told Ralph Chamberlin he could stay, but he refused, as the Petersons weren't given the same offer. This ignited a great deal of controversy in the school and surrounding community. The students of BYU overwhelmingly supported the professors, and a petition of support signed by at least 80% of the student body was submitted to BYU officials and reprinted in the Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City's largest secular newspaper. Unwilling to change their teachings, the Petersons and Ralph Chamberlin left the university in 1911, while William remained for another 5 years, resigning in 1916. The loss of the faculty represented an intellectual loss to the university, and a stifling effect on students as well as faculty. Milton Bennion, writing in March 1911, called the conflict the most significant event in Utah's recent educational history. Ann Weaver Hart wrote that the 1911 BYU controversy made Utah comparatively less emotional and reactionary than other parts of the country during the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial. At the University of Utah in Salt Lake City a similar controversy ‚Äî what some at the time described as 'a tempest in a teapot' ‚Äî erupted four years later in February 1915. There, the dismissals of two professors and two instructors by President Joseph T. Kingsbury ‚Äî and the subsequent resignations of 14 faculty members in protest ‚Äî launched the American Association of University Professors' first institutional academic freedom inquest, spearheaded by AAUP founders Arthur O. Lovejoy and John Dewey. The 1911 BYU controversy ‚Äî involving some of the same professors, including the Peterson brothers and the Chamberlins ‚Äî led in part to the University of Utah debacle. As a result of these intertwined academic storms, the AAUP published the document now known as the 1915 Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure. Appearing in the inaugural December 1915 volume of the Bulletin of the American Association of University Professors, this became the AAUP's foundational statement on the rights and corresponding obligations of members of the academic profession.

The fact of eliminating the need for a human chauffeur, which represents a significant part of the operating costs of that type of services, could make it a very affordable solution for the customers and accelerate the spreading of Transportation-as-a-Service (TaaS) solutions as opposed to individual car ownership. However, it raises the issue of job destruction. Several studies highlighted that robo-taxis operated in an Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD) service could be one of the most rapidly adopted applications of autonomous cars at scale and a major mobility solution in the near future, especially in urban areas, providing the majority of vehicle miles in the United States within a decade of their first introduction. Moreover, they could have a very positive impact on road safety, traffic congestion and parking. Concerning pollution and consumption of energy and other resources, robo-taxis could lead to significant improvement since these services will most probably use electric cars and for most of the rides, less vehicle size and range is necessary compared to usual, individually owned vehicles. The expectable reduction of the number of vehicles means less embodied energy but energy consumption for redistribution of empty vehicles must be taken into account.  Current advances   First operational tests  Several companies are testing robo-taxi services, especially in Asia and in the United-States. In most tests, there are human chauffeurs or \\"safety drivers\\" in these test cars to take control back in case of emergency. In August 2016, MIT spinoff NuTonomy was the first company to make robo-taxis available to the public, starting to offer rides with a fleet of 6 modified Renault Zoes and Mitsubishi i-MiEVs in a limited area in Singapore. NuTonomy later signed three significant partnerships to develop its robo-taxi service: with Grab, Uber‚Äôs rival in Southeast Asia, with Groupe PSA, which is supposed to provide the company with Peugeot 3008 SUVs and the last one with Lyft to launch a robo- taxi service in Boston. In September 2016, Uber started allowing a select group of users in Pittsburgh to order robo-taxis from a fleet of 14 modified Ford Fusions. The test extended to San Francisco with modified Volvo XC90s before being relocated to Tempe, Arizona in February 2017. In March 2017, one of Uber‚Äôs robo-taxis crashed in self-driving mode in Arizona, which led the company to suspend its tests before resuming them a few days later. In early 2017, Waymo, the Google self-driving car project which became an independent company in 2016, started a large public robo-taxi test in Phoenix using 100 and then 500 more Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans provided by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles as part of a partnership between the two companies. Waymo also signed a deal with Lyft to collaborate on self-driving cars in May 2017. In November 2017, Waymo revealed it had begun to operate some of its automated vehicles in Arizona without a safety driver behind the wheel. In August 2017, Cruise Automation, a self-driving startup acquired by General Motors in 2016, launched the beta version of a robo-taxi service for its employees in San Francisco using a fleet of 46 Chevrolet Bolt EVs.  Tesla Robo-Taxi  Tesla, Inc. has announced they are planning to launch their robo-taxis service by 2020. \\"I feel very confident predicting autonomous robo-taxi for Tesla next year. Not in all jurisdictions, because we won't have regulatory approval everywhere, but I'm confident we'll have at least regulatory approvals somewhere, literally next year\\" -Elon Musk in April 2019. According to Elon Musk, CEO of the company, any customer will be able to add their car to the \\"Tesla network\\". They claimed that it would be a combination of Uber and Airbnb models. In the announcement, Elon Musk expected that car owners would be able to add or subtract their car from the network. Adding the car to the fleet would be done by selecting \\"Commit your car to the fleet\\", and can then be removed by selecting a \\"Summon Tesla\\" option. The features are part of a planned app update according to Elon. In exchange, Tesla plans to take between 25-30% of the revenue. In places where there are not enough cars shared by car owners, Tesla would have dedicated Tesla vehicles.  Other developments  Many automakers have announced their plans to develop robo-taxis before 2025 and specific partnerships have been signed between automakers, technology providers and service operators. Most significant disclosed information include: * Japan's plan to have an operational robo-taxi service running for the 2020 Olympic Games thanks to the company Robot Taxi, a joint venture between DeNA and ZMP; * The startup Zoox announcing in 2015 its ambition to build a robo-taxi from scratch; * Delphi being selected in 2016 by the Singapore Land Transport Authority to run robo-taxi tests that are yet to be launched; * Daimler AG teaming up with Bosch in 2017 to develop the software for a robo-taxi service by 2025; * The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance partnering with Transdev and DeNA to develop robo-taxi services within 10 years from 2017; * Volkswagen releasing during the 2017 Geneva Motor Show its autonomous concept car Sedric, which could be used as a robo-taxi; * General Motors and Lyft partnering to deploy a large robo-taxi test fleet in 2018 (following a $500 million investment made by General Motors in Lyft in 2016); * Ford Motor's plan to develop a robo-taxi by 2021 thanks to several partnerships; * Daimler AG partnering with Uber in 2017 to operate a fleet of autonomous Mercedes cars on Uber's network; * BMW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles partnering with Intel and Mobileye to develop robo-taxis by 2021; * Honda releasing in 2017 an autonomous concept car, NeuV, that aims at being a personal robo-taxi; * Baidu partnering with Nvidia to develop autonomous cars and robo-taxis; * Ford Motor investing $1 billion in the startup Argo AI to develop autonomous cars and robo-taxis; * Voyage, a spin-out of Udacity‚Äôs self-driving car nanodegree program launched in 2017, aiming at creating its own robo-taxi service using retrofitted mass-production cars; * Lyft partnering with the startup Drive.ai in 2017 to launch a pilot robo-taxi service in San Francisco Bay Area in the coming years; * Lyft and Ford partnering in 2017 to add Ford's self-driving cars to Lyft's ride-hailing network; * Lyft's cars ownership will be fully transferred to company be end of 2025 and 25.9% of the household population * Delphi buying the startup NuTonomy for $400 million in 2017; * Parsons Corporation announcing a partnership with automated mobility operating system company Renovo.auto to deploy and scale AMoD services; * The French startup Navya revealing, in 2017, its robo-taxi, the Autonom Cab, that will first be tested through a partnership with Keolis and RAC and then sold to other companies from Q3 2018; * Google leading a $1 billion investment in 2017 in Lyft which could support Waymo's robotaxi strategy; * Aptiv and Lyft testing robo-taxis during the 2018 Las Vegas CES; * Volkswagen and Hyundai announcing, during the 2018 Las Vegas CES, a partnership with the startup Aurora, founded by one of the co-founders of Google's self-driving cars project, to develop vehicles for Moia, Volkswagen's ride-hailing network; * Didi Chuxing partnering with the Renault- Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance and other automakers to explore the future launch of robotaxi services in China. * AutoX (which is backed by Alibaba) mentioned that the first fully-autonomous robotaxis could be on the roads by the end of the year 2020.Chinese 'robotaxis' take riders for a spin  References  Self-driving cars Automotive technologies Emerging technologies Robotics Automation Transport culture ","title":"Robotaxi"},{"id":"46530285","text":"Live at the Belly Up is a digital-only live album recorded in January 2015 by The Jayhawks, released on February 10, 2015 as an exclusive download from the Belly Up Live website.

Merrie Melodies cartoon film directed by Tex Avery. The short was released on September 25, 1937. Plot A mother parrot in a cage is teaching her three children to say, \\"Polly want a cracker.\\" The first two kids, Patrick and Patricia, do so after some effort, but Peter boldly refuses, pointing at a framed photo of his dad he states, \\"I don't want a cracker! I wanna be a sailor, like me pop.\\" His mother immediately begins deriding her husband, telling Peter that right after he and his siblings were born, their dad had set sail for Hawaii (\\"No, Maw, it was Catalina,\\" Dad, as she remembers him, reminds her). She tells her son, \\"I used to burn a little light in the window\\" (it was actually a searchlight), hoping for his dad's return, but he never did come back. Nonetheless, Peter stubbornly stomps off to become a sailor. He bumps into a barrel, from which he builds a ship with a red pajama for a sail and a skull-and-crossbones label from a poison bottle for a Jolly Roger flag. He joins forces with an annoyingly loquacious duck (whom he silences by clamping his beak shut with a clothespin), and the two set sail on the lake - Peter as captain, the duck as deck-swab. They eventually run into trouble in a thunderstorm (which the duck revels in, being more accustomed to water) and end up overboard. Peter calls out for his \\"Momma\\". She comes running, but the duck has already saved him. Despite it all, Peter still wants to be a sailor.

Leierm√•l had particular importance to women and men in all age and social groups in Scandinavia in the 1600s and 1700s because in this period, new laws and severe penalties were introduced in this area. Leierm√•l was considered a crime and were commonly detected in those cases that resulted in pregnancy, but pregnancy was not a prerequisite for the deed to be considered as illegal and punishable. Various forms of leierm√•l had different severities. There were distinctions between simple or loose leierm√•l (sex between two unmarried persons), adultery (sex between a married and an unmarried person), and dobbelthor (adultery between two married people). In addition to the designation hor (fornication), there were also phrases such as samleie (sexual intercourse), \\"renting together\\", and \\"searching for a bed together\\". Church and state in the 1600s had a common interest in developing new legislation which regulated sexual behavior and punished those who committed crimes. The motivation was twofold. Man wanted to avoid the wrath of God, needed order and method, and wanted to have control. Protestantism had a dualistic view of women, sexuality, and family. A woman could be both a whore and a madonna, and therefore had to be controlled strictly to remain a madonna.

Life Robert Francis Ruttledge was born in Brownshill, County Carlow on 11 September 1899. He was the eldest son of Thomas Henry Bruen Ruttledge and Mary Caroline (n√©e Browne-Clayton). Ruttledge grew up in County Mayo, at the family home of Bloomfield House. He attended Marlborough College and later the Quetta cadet college, India. Ruttledge married Mabel Rose (n√©e Burke) in 1928, with whom he had two daughters. Military career Ruttledge served in the Indian Army with the 34th Prince Albert Victor's Own Poona Horse from 1918 to 1921, and following that regiment's amalgamation with the 33rd Queen Victoria's Own Light Cavalry to form the 17th Poona Horse, with them from 1921 to 1939. He served during the 1919 Waziristan campaign, and was awarded the Military Cross. His citation was: Lt. Robert Francis Ruttledge; 34th Poona Horse, attd. 21st Cav., F.F. For gallantry and devotion on 21 November 1919, between Jatta and Murtaza Posts, when, after a brisk engagement, the troops under the command of Captain Byrne were ordered to retire. Lieutenant Ruttledge, observing that three dismounted men were in difficulty getting a wounded man away, and realising that the retirement would be delayed, galloped back in face of heavy fire, took the wounded man on his horse, and carried him to a place of safety.London Gazette 27 September 1920 He also served with the Poona Horse during the operations on the North West Frontier 1930‚Äì31.January 1939 Supplement to the Indian Army List He was appointed commandant of the bodyguard of the Governor of Madras from 1934 to 1939.January 1939 Indian Army List Ruttledge was transferred to the Special Unemployed List as a Major in April 1939, but he was recalled in September 1939 to the Poona Horse at the outbreak of World War II however he was invalided out before he returned to active service.January 1941 Supplement to the Indian Army List Zoological work Ruttledge has been described as one of the founders of Irish Ornithology, having played a key role in the observation of birds and the establishment of bird sanctuaries. Both Ruttledge and his brother William were keen naturalists. He published his first paper at age sixteen in the Irish Naturalist on the birds of Lough Carra, and went on to publish over 200 papers over his lifetime. Ruttledge is cited as being a key figure in highlighting the decline in Ireland of the Greater white-fronted goose, which allowed for the protection of the Irish population of these birds. Ruttledge was involved in the establishment of the bird sanctuary on Saltee Islands and Cape Clear Island. Ruttledge launched the Irish Bird Report (now Irish Birds) in 1953, and continued to edit it for 19 years. In 1961 he was awarded the Bernard Tucker Medal by the British Trust for Ornithology, and an honorary doctorate from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1981. Ruttledge served as the first president of the Irish Wildbird Conservancy (now BirdWatch Ireland), with the Greater white-fronted goose as its emblem.

Early life and education Born in 1950 in the town of Ezk√°roz in the province of Navarre, he earned a baccalaureate in La Estella. Later he moved to Pamplona, where he studied philosophy, letters, and theology at the Higher Center for Theological Studies in Pamplona. He received a degree in Theological and Moral Sciences. Career In 1973, with the encouragement of politicians Enrique M√∫gica and G. Peces-Barba, he took part in the formation of the Spanish Socialist Workers‚Äô Party (PSOE). A year later, he took part in the founding of the Socialist Federation of Navarre. In 1975 he was elected Secretary of Political Relations of the Socialist Association of the Province of Navarre and a member of the Federal Committee of the PSOE. In 1976 he was ordained a priest of the Order of Missionaries of the Divine Word. In the same year he participated in the writing of the manifesto of the Democratic Convergence (Coordinacion Democratica, or Platajunta), which coordinated the opposition to the dictatorial regime after the death of Francisco Franco. One of his first public act was to represent Navarre at the Assembly of Basque Parliamentarians held in Gernika on June 16, 1977. He was elected to the Congress of Deputies in 1977 and re-elected in 1979. Also in 1979, he was elected a parliamentary representative for the city of Pamplona, a post to which he was re-elected in 1983, 1987, and 1991, and served as spokesman for the Socialist Parliamentary Group and as secretary of the Basque Parliamentary Council. During his second term in the Congress of Deputies he was on the Agriculture, Economy, and Finance commissions. He left the Congress of Deputies in 1982 to join the Navarre Parliament. Also in 1982, he sat on the commission that re-negotiated the Pact of Reintegration and Improvement of the Regional Regime with the Spanish government. In the same year, he was elected Secretary General of the Socialist Party of Navarre (PSN). In 1984, he was named President of Navarre because he was the head of the party with the largest number of seats in the regional parliament, and took office on May 5 of that year. He was re-elected to the Navarre Parliament in 1985 and was re-appointed President of Navarre in 1987. During his second term, he opposed the incorporation of Navarre into the Basque Autonomous Community. He served as President until 1991, when the Navarrese People‚Äôs Union (UPN), under Juan Cruz Alli, came to power. In 1994, he left the position of Secretary General of the PSN when he was accused of accepting bribes in exchange for awarding public works contracts.
