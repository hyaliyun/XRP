A member of the Wampanoag tribe, she has spent most of her life in her tribal homeland of Mashpee, Massachusetts. She hails from a prominent Mashpee Wampanoag family, including Tribal Chairman Russell \\"Fast Turtle\\" Peters (her father), and was active in the tribe's long and contested push for federal recognition. In a 2006 interview with NPR, Peters recalled a time when \\"nobody in Washington cared much about which tribes were recognized.\\" Like her father before her, Peters served on the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council. In 2005, she ran against Glenn Marshall for Council Chairperson. Writing career Peters has made several endeavors outside the realm of journalism, Peters continues to write. In 2009 she presented her work, \\"Wampanoag Reflections\\" to the Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants in Cohasset, Massachusetts. She has written several essays, including \\"A Lesser-Known Atlantic Crossing\\" and \\"Epanow's Escape.\\" Peters' work has been republished in an anthology of Native American writing from New England, including \\"Wampanoag Reflections,\\" as well as a piece about cultural appropriation called \\"Beware: Not All Terms Are Fair Game\\". Peters is also the author of Mashpee Nine: A Story of Cultural Justice, published by SmokeSygnals in 2016. Public education career In addition to her writing and consulting, Peters has worked as a public educator of Native history. She served for a time as Director of Marketing and Public Relations for the Wampanoag Indian Program at Plimoth Plantation. Peters has joined the committee of Plymouth, 400 Inc., a non-profit organization committed to planning a commemoration for the 400th anniversary of the landing of the Mayflower in 1620.; she represents Wampanoag interests on the organization's Board of Directors. In this capacity, she also served as the executive producer and a main contributor to the exhibit \\"Captured: 1614\\" located at the Plymouth Public Library in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The exhibit, unveiled in November 2014, marked the 400th anniversary of the kidnapping of Squanto and 19 other Wampanoag tribe members, who were brought to Europe to be sold as slaves. The exhibit, conceptualized and designed by Peters's company Smoke Sygnals, seeks to inform the public about what happened with Native Americans in the years prior to 1620. The exhibit explains how Squanto and Samoset were so well-equipped to communicate with American settlers when they landed at Plymouth Rock; Peters sees it as lending Wampanoag voice to the telling of American history.

The Islamic Movement and Islamic human rights groups have claimed that Nigerian government's close ties with Israel were responsible for the attacks on the pro-Palestinian group.  Statements  Zakzaky said, > I am appealing to my followers to be patient and remain calm. After the > burial of those killed, we will decide what action to take. I have > communicated with the authorities, and they are all claiming not to be aware > of the operation. It is my belief that the operation was ordered from Abuja.

An agent of the 2nd Duke of Argyll, he pursued Argyll's interests in Parliament and without, and held a succession of public offices. Early life Steuart was the only son of Thomas Steuart, commissary and stewart clerk of Orkney, Scotland and his second wife Isobel Young, daughter of Andrew Young of Castle Yards, Orkney. He was educated at King's College, Aberdeen in 1701, becoming an advocate in 1707. He was an agent of the Duke of Argyll and his brother, Lord Ilay and under their patronage he obtained a place as principal clerk of the Scottish Exchequer worth £500 p.a. in 1705. After the Union, the post was abolished by the Act establishing the Scottish exchequer court and he was compensated with a joint post as King's remembrancer of the Scottish Exchequer in 1708 which he held for the rest of his life. Career Steuart stood as Court candidate for Tain Burghs at the 1710 British general election but was unsuccessful. At the 1713 British general election he was returned as Member of Parliament for Inverness Burghs. Argyll and Ilay had split with Robert Harley and Steuart's return was a hostile act towards ministerial interests, and a reprisal against the Jacobite former member. Steuart followed the Hanoverian line of his patrons and voted against the expulsion of Richard Steele on 18 March. He voted in favour of extending the schism bill to cover Catholic education on 12 May, and was a teller against a Scottish Tory initiative for the investigation of episcopal revenues in Scotland on 3 July. He was appointed secretary to the Prince of Wales for Scotland in 1714. At the 1715 British general election Steuart was returned unopposed as MP for Inverness Burghs, but was unsuccessful standing for Orkney and Shetland. He voted with the Government from 1715, except on the motion against Argyll’s rival, Lord Cadogan, on 4 June 1717. He was a director of the East India Company from 1716 to 1719. At the 1722 British general election he was returned as MP for Ayr Burghs. In about 1724 Argyll and Ilay quarrelled, and never spoke to each another for many years after. During this time, Steuart acted as a channel of communication between the two brothers. He lost his post to the Prince of Wales when George became King in 1727. At the 1727 British general election, he was returned unopposed as MP for Ayr Burghs and for Elgin Burghs, but chose to sit for Ayr Burghs. He was appointed paymaster of pensions in 1731 and was returned again for Ayr Burghs in the consequential by-election. At the 1734 British general election he was returned unopposed for Elgin Burghs alone. By 1739 he was appointed overseer of the King's swans and was in possession of offices worth £1,400. When Argyll went into opposition in 1739, Steuart continued in support of Ilay. He retired from Parliament at the 1741 British general election. Later life and legacy Steuart married Frances Cheyne, the daughter of Dr. George Cheyne of Bath, in 1741, but had no children. He died on 13 September 1768.

It is the most upstream of three bridges where the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway switches from one side of the river to the other, the others being the bridge near P Street and the L Street Bridge.Davis, Timothy (1992). History and Description, pp. 10–12, 92, 96 History As part of the construction of the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway in the 1930s, the original bridge was purposely built in a utilitarian style, using salvaged steel trusses from the Georgetown Aqueduct Bridge. According to Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway Commission executive officer Ulysses S. Grant III, the bridge's appearance would encourage the public to demand a more aesthetically pleasing and expensive bridge. The steel-girder bridge was constructed in 1929, part of the first stretch of the parkway opened. It was indeed soon considered to not fit in with the desired appearance of the park, as well as being a traffic hazard, and attracted the disapproval of the United States Commission of Fine Arts, which was responsible for reviewing architecture in the capital. The new bridge was constructed in 1938 and cost nearly $103,000. Due to the volume of traffic that the bridge would handle, it was constructed in two halves: the upstream lanes of the old bridge were demolished and then that half of the new bridge was constructed, followed by the same process on the downstream lanes. The current bridge is a concrete- arch bridge with mica schist facing quarried from Bethesda and Cabin John, Maryland, together with some granite elements. As was common in parkway design at the time, it was designed to be harmonious with its surroundings. The bridge was rehabilitated in 1987.

Early years Born Peter Roylance de la Mothe at Spring Hill, Brisbane, to parents Charles Joseph de la Mothe, a chemist who had moved to Australia from France, and his wife Anna Mary (née Oliver), he was educated at St Francis School in Hughenden, and then Mount Carmel College in Charters Towers.Delamothe, Sir Peter Roylance (1904–1973) -- Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 20 April 2015. Awarded an open scholarship after coming third in the state for his final examinations, Delamothe entered the University of Sydney where he obtained M.B. and B.S. degrees. Between 1927 and 1930, he served as a junior, then senior, resident medical officer at Sydney Hospital, where he also practiced ophthalmological surgery before entering into private practice. It was around this time that he anglicized his name to Delamothe. By January 1933, Delamothe was back in Queensland and appointed as the medical superintendent of the Collinsville hospital. Known for his hard work, he performed seventy-seven operations in his first seven weeks there, which greatly increased the hospital's popularity with the local population. In early 1936, he moved to Bowen and set up his own practice. On 26 October 1940, Delamothe joined the Royal Australian Air ForceDELAMOTHE, PETER ROYLANCE -- WW2 Nominal Roll. Retrieved 20 April 2015. as a probationary flight lieutenant and was based at several different hospitals and medical receiving stations. By October 1944 he had been promoted to the rank of temporary wing commander and was transferred to the reserves. Political career In 1939, Delamothe stood as an independent for the mayoralty of Bowen but was unsuccessful. After World War II, he once again stood for the position at the 1946 council elections and this time was successful and went on to serve for twelve years. During this time he carried on with his medical practice and at one stage locating his surgery in the municipal chambers. Delamothe fought hard for the construction of a major highway diversion to Bowen but his efforts proved fruitless. He oversaw the start of a sewerage system for the town and the first co-ordinated attempts made to attract tourists to the region. In April 1958, Bowen was hit by a cyclone, destroying most of the town. As the cyclone was at it worst, Mayor Delamothe was performing surgery by torchlight on a critically ill patient at the local hospital, which had already lost its roof. Delamothe accepted the Liberal nomination for the resurrected electorate of Bowen at the 1960 state elections and went on to win the seat, holding it until it was abolished in 1971. Within three years of entering the parliament he was appointed Minister for Justice and Attorney- General, holding the role until his retirement from politics in December 1971. From June 1967, Delamothe was also the Deputy Leader of the Queensland Liberal Party. During his time as Minister for Justice and Attorney-General, Delamothe acted to ease the backlog of cases in Queensland courts, and helped establish the Law Reform Commission and the Legal Aid Bureau. He introduced weekend detention and work-release programs for minor offenders and reduced prison overcrowding by convincing the government to carry out an extensive building program. Delamothe reformed Queensland's alcohol laws, enabling Brisbane hotels to remain open on Sundays and for the first time women were allowed into the public bar. He was also responsible for introducing the state's first consumer protection laws. On 20 December 1971, the day after his retirement from parliament, Delamothe took up an appointment as the Queensland Agent- General in London. He held the role until serious illness forced his resignation in September 1973. Personal life At the Ashfield Methodist Church in Sydney, Delamothe married Myrtle Eunice Lois Bussell on 23 April 1931 and they had four sons. Their marriage later ended in divorce and on 17 May 1947 he married Joan Patricia Milner at the Australian Inland Mission Hall in Broome, Western Australia. This marriage was to produce a son and two daughters. In 1959 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and he was knighted in June 1973. Delamothe died of cancer at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London in October 1973. He was cremated and his ashes scattered on Bowen harbour.

Although \\"extremely complex\\", the standard text-handling abilities of the Cocoa text system have been widely praised as without peer. It is possible to implement a fully featured rich text editor in only a few lines of code. Formerly embodied in developer NeXT Inc.'s OpenStep API specification, and implemented in NeXT's OPENSTEP operating system, and probably also in the earlier NeXTSTEP platform, Cocoa's NSText has additionally been implemented via the OpenStep API specification successfully in third-party implementations such as the free-and-open-source GNUstep. The Cocoa text system uses a Model- View-Controller design pattern. The view layer is handled by NSTextView and NSTextField, NSLayoutManager and NSTextContainer are the controller layer, and NSTextStorage (a mutable attributed string subclass) is the model. The Cocoa text system also interacts with Services to provide standard streams functionality in a GUI environment. Users interact with two classes, NSTextField (providing single-line edit fields) or NSTextView (providing multi-line editing). Each NSTextField uses a shared instance of a NSTextView called the \\"field editor\\". This was done to reduce high memory requirements that would arise if every field implemented its own NSTextView object graph when only one field can actually have focus at any time.

The current main building was designed by Andreas Kirkerup and is listed. History Portrait of Henrik Bjelke by Karel van Mander III The area is first mentioned in 1307 when Cecilie Jonsdatter left it to Esrum Abbey in her will and the property is later known as Rompe. The property was from about 1600 owned by the crown. The farm was destroyed in the two Dano-Swedish Wars (1657-1660). In 1663, Frederick III granted the property to Admiral of the Realm Henrik Bjelke and his wife Edel Ylfeldt for life. Five years later, the king created a deed which ceded the property to Edel Ulfeldt and her descendants. It mentions the name \\"Edelgave\\" as the name of a future manor house at the site. Bjelke expanded the estate with several new tenants farms prior to its elevation to manor house in 1682. He also constructed a new half- timbered, three-winged main building. The house was destroyed in a fire in the early 1780s. The owner, Jakob Bornemann, commissioned Andreas Kirkerup to build a new house which was completed in 1791. For more than a hundred years, from 1807 until 1919, Edelgave belonged to the Tutein family. From 1921 to 1943, it was owned by Th. Madsen-Mygdal who later became prime minister. From 1958 to 1992, Edelgave was owned by Gudmund Jørgensen, the founder of Vallø Saft, a fruit juice company based at Køge, who planted most of the land with fruit trees. Architecture The main wing Avlsgården: The large barn with the gateway as seen from the courtyard The plastered, Neoclassical house consists of a two-storey main wing with a black-glazed tile roof flanked by two one-storey lateral wings with red tile roofs. The house fronts a large courtyard which is flanked by farm buildings (Avlsgården) on its three other sides. The farm buildings mostly date from 1866 but integrate remains of the Bjelke's original half-timbered farm buildings. The main building is listed. The farm buildings are not listed. Surroundings Edelgave Allé and Gyngehøj The estate covers 300 hectares. Two small woods, Edelgave Skov and Slotsskoven, have a combined area of 27 hectares with the remainder being farmland and orchards. Smørholm, the 700-year-old site of the main castle building, is located immediately to the southeast of the current main building. The ash tree avenue Edelgave Allé and the burial mound Gyngehøj next to it are protected. In popular culture Edelgave has been used as a location for the films Tre finder en kro (1955), Et døgn uden løgn (1963), Pigen og greven (1966), Nyhavns glade gutter (1967), Der kom en soldat (1969) Tandlæge på sengekanten (1971) and Fætrene på Torndal (1973).

He joined the Publicity Department in 2014 as a deputy head. Prior to his appointment he served in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, and is considered a close associate of Xi Jinping, current General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. He was the one time Communist Party Secretary of Hangzhou. Career Huang was born in Shanghang County, Fujian province. In December 1974, Huang began serving in the People's Liberation Army. Two years later, he joined the Communist Party of China. In 1977, after serving for three years in the army, he went back to his home county and became a secretary. He entered Fujian Normal University in 1978. After graduation, he was sent by the party to work in the Longyan region of Fujian in a series of administrative roles. He later rose through the hierarchy to become Party Committee Secretary of Yongding County, then in February 1998, following the conversion of the administrative status of Longyan from a Prefecture into a \\"City\\", Huang became its mayor. In August 1999, he was sent to the city of Huzhou in neighbouring Zhejiang province to serve as mayor. In February 2003, he became party secretary of Jiaxing, a prosperous city on China's east coast. By June 2007, Huang was named a member of the provincial Party Standing Committee and the head of the provincial party organization's Publicity Department. At around the same time, he earned a Masters of Public Administration from Tsinghua University. In January 2010, Huang was named party secretary of Hangzhou, one of about a dozen cities with \\"sub-provincial\\" status in China. Huang became an alternate member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held in the fall of 2012. In October 2013, he was named deputy head of the Central Publicity Department. In December 2014, he was promoted to executive deputy head, with rank equivalent to that of a minister. The executive deputy head position of the Publicity Department is a powerful one, as it oversees roughly all day-to-day administrative aspects of the department. External observers have called Huang's installation in the position as a means to check the influence of Liu Yunshan, a member of the party's top ruling body the Politburo Standing Committee who is widely believed to be a conservative. Huang was also named chief of the Office of the Central Guidance Commission on Building Spiritual Civilization. The later years of Huang's career roughly follows in the footsteps of Xi Jinping, who was named General Secretary of the Communist Party in 2012. Huang began working with Xi in Fujian province where Xi served as governor. Later Huang moved to Zhejiang during Xi's term as Party Committee Secretary there. After Xi rose to become party leader, Huang again was transferred from Zhejiang to the party centre. Because of Huang's close links with Xi, he is considered a member of the New Zhijiang Army, an informal grouping of Xi's closest associates who were considered destined for higher office. After the 19th Party Congress, Huang became head of the Publicity Department, and a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China. Shortly thereafter he also became head of a task force on combating pornography and illegal publications. Huang was an alternate member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and a full member of the 19th Central Committee.

Lutz Gissmann is known for his seminal research in the field of human papillomaviruses (HPV) and their causal association with human cancer, especially cervical cancer. In his early work, he demonstrated genetic heterogeneity among HPV isolates leading the way to the now well- established concept of distinct HPV types (up to now more than 200) of which some are associated with specific benign or malignant disease. In the early 1980s in the laboratory of later Nobel Prize laureate Harald zur Hausen he was the first (together with the postgraduates Matthias Dürst and Michael Boshart supervised by him) to isolate and characterize HPV16 and HPV18, the two most oncogenic HPV types causing the vast majority of HPV-induced anogenital and head-and-neck cancers. This groundbreaking work of Lutz Gissmann provided experimental evidence for the causal association of specific HPV types with human cancer, and laid the foundation for the development of prophylactic HPV vaccines for the prevention of cervical cancer and other HPV-induced cancers. His current research interest is on development of second generation prophylactic and therapeutic HPV vaccines.  Professional biography  Lutz Gissmann obtained a diploma in biology and a PhD in Microbiology and Genetics of the University of Erlangen (Germany). Together with Harald zur Hausen he moved to the University of Freiburg as a Post Doc and later became assistant professor in virology. In 1983 he was appointed as head of the division “Genome Modifications and Carcinogenesis” at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg and professor of virology at the University of Heidelberg. He was on leave of absence from 1993 to 1997 as director of research in the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and chairman of the program \\"Viral Oncology\\" at the Loyola University Medical Center, Chicago, USA and from 1998 to 1999 as vice president of research and development, MediGene AG, Martinsried, Germany. Lutz Gissmann was member of the DKFZ Board of trustees (2002-2012), speaker of the research programs Applied Tumor Virology (1991-1993) and Infection and Cancer (2012-2014) and Ombudsman for the PhD students at DKFZ (2004-2010). Under his guidance numerous diploma and Ph.D. students were introduced to the fascination of science and the fun side of life in a research laboratory. Lutz Gissmann has published more than 200 peer reviewed scientific contributions, holds several patents and has written numerous book contributions.

The coordinates of Kisubi Hospital are . Overview The hospital is owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kampala and administered by the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa. It has a bed capacity of 110. The hospital serves a peri- urban population in southern Busiro and Kyaddondo Counties. The hospital offers specialized services including emergency department, outpatients department, general surgery, urology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, internal medicine, maternity services, pediatrics, and otolaryngology. It has three operating rooms and a four-bed intensive care unit. History In 1904, the Congregation of the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa established a health centre at Kisubi to help those suffering from sleeping sickness, which was prevalent in the area at that time. Over the next 110 years, the facility has expanded into a fully fledged hospital, with 110 beds. On four occasions, before March 2010, the hospital conducted free surgeries to patients who could not afford the cost. In 2019 the hospital opened a new heart treatment centre, capable of performing a cardiac catheterization procedure. This cath-lab is one of the only two such labs in Uganda, as of January 2020. The other cardiac catheterization laboratory in the county is located at the Uganda Heart Institute in Mulago Hospital Complex, in Kampala.

The name refers to Mount Fako. Silicon Mountain is currently home to tech startups and a growing community of developers, designers, business professionals as well as universities such as the University of Buea, Catholic University Institute of Buea, Saint Monica University and many others. This region occupies the entire Fako Division of the South West Region of Cameroon. The phrase originally was the de facto reference to the Buea Tech Community popularized during local tech community meetups such as BarCamp Cameroon 2013, Google I/O Extended Buea 2015 and the Kamer Design Meetups; but has eventually come to refer to the community of developers, creatives, organizers, business professionals, universities in the area. Origin of term Beautiful Landscape of Mount Fako The Silicon Mountain is a term used to refer to the tech ecosystem (cluster) in Fako division of Cameroon with epicenter Buea. The term is a play ( phrasal portmanteau ) on Silicon Valley and Mount Fako (which is the most dominant feature of Cameroon's topography and the highest geographical point in West and Central Africa). It was first used publicly by Rebecca Enonchong at the BarCamp Cameroon conference which took place at Catholic University Institute Of Buea, Buea in 2013. History Buea city Silicon Mountain is located in and around the city of Buea, which according to social scientists was founded by a hunter in search of game. Eye Njie Tama Lifanje came from the Bomboko clan behind the Buea Mountain (Mount Cameroon or Mount Fako). On that fateful day he founded Buea, he had set out in search of animals but there were no game to be hunted only a vast peace of hospitable land that could harbor his family. Eyé Njie named it “Mwea”, meaning, hospitable land for farming. The settlement soon grew into a clan but made tardy progress until the later part of the 19th century, when there was an influx of Europeans into Africa for exploration and colonialism purposes. Tea growing is an important local industry, especially in Tole. Buea was the colonial capital of the German Kamerun from 1901 to 1919, and the capital of the Southern Cameroons from 1949 until 1961. The German colonial administration in Buea was temporarily suspended during the eruption of Mount Cameroon from 28 April – June 1909. Originally, Buea's population consisted mainly of the Bakweri people. However, due to its position as the defunct capital of the Federated State Of West Cameroon, regional capital of the South West and university town, it has attracted a significant number of other ethnic groups. 279x279px Side view of the Prime Ministers Lodge in Buea The epicenter of the Silicon Mountain, Buea, hosts the University of Buea, the first Anglo-Saxon-styled university of Cameroon, alongside the Catholic University Institute Of Buea, the Pan African Institute Of Development, just to name a few. The city still has a handful of colonial era buildings, notably the palatial former residence of the German governor, Jesko von Puttkamer. Other German colonial buildings especially the Prime Minister's Lodge (Schloss) and the Bismarks' fountain are still standing, albeit some of them suffer from lack of maintenance and old age. As of 2010, a study showed that about 3000,000 people live in Buea ( including Bokwaongo, Muea, Bomaka, Tole, Mile 16 (Bolifamba), Mile 17, Mile 15, Mile 14 (Dibanda), Bova, Bonjongo, Likombe, Buasa, and surrounding villages). It also hosts the Nigerian Consulate in Anglophone Cameroon and is the main operational hub of the Naigahelp medical aid organisation. In 2017, businesses in Silicon Mountain were negatively affected by several internet shutdowns that authorities enacted in the English-speaking areas of Cameroon in an effort to clamp down on criticism of the government. Silicon Mountain Annual Conference The Buea Techosystem starting from 2015 organizes the annual Silicon Mountain conference popularly referred to as #smconfb which brings together over 500+ like-minded creatives and hackers from the Mountain Area and around Africa for two days of sessions, labs, speakers. It features tech talks, design and code labs. The Silicon Mountain Conference has the following; SESSION Categories Universities, colleges, professional schools alt= alt=  Technology Startups  There is a growing number of high technology startups/companies headquartered in Silicon Mountain as is listed below;  Startup Incubators   Tech Blogs   Technology Communities  There exist local developer communities aimed at promoting Computer Science, programming, Startups and developer technologies.

The vertical cut recording system was developed by Pathé in France in 1905 and did not infringe on patents held by Victor and Columbia. However, customers willing to purchase vertical cut records also needed to obtain special equipment to play them, equipped with a sapphire ball in the pickup rather than the standard steel needle. Consequently, the public's marginal interest in vertical cut technology was not enough to keep Boston Talking Machine afloat, and in 1913 it was sold to Morris Keen and folded into his Keen-O-Phone firm. Legacy Phono-Cut records utilized only one system of numbering starting with 5000; the highest known number is 5244 ('Bake Dat Chicken Pie' by Collins and Harlan). Some members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra made Phono-Cut Records, among them legendary clarinetist Georges Grisez. Henry Burr also made some records for Phono-Cut. As they were made for a failed system, and most remaining vertical cut records were scrapped during the shellac drives of World War II, Phono-Cut discs are not common, though they are not viewed as exceptionally valuable by collectors. Nevertheless, by bringing the vertical cut process to the United States, Phono-Cut paved the way for other labels, such as Rex Records (1912), Gennett Records, Paramount Records, Okeh Records and Brunswick Records, to enter the marketplace using vertical cut technology until the Victor and Columbia patents were declared expired in 1921.

He has approached this general topic by investigating how information is fundamental for controlling the behavior and evolutionary capabilities of complex systems, as well as abstracting principles from natural systems to produce adaptive information technology. Accepting Von Neumann's principle of self-replication and Turing's universal computation as a general principle for generating open-ended complexity that encompasses Natural Selection, Dr. Rocha has developed the work of Howard Pattee,Rocha, Luis M.

From this viewpoint, he has approached several questions: how do cells and collectives of cells compute? Is language an evolutionary system operating under the same principle? Can artificial systems implement the same principle? Namely, can collective intelligence on the web become a super-organism implementing this principle?Rocha, Luis M. and Johan Bollen. \\"Biologically Motivated Distributed Designs for Adaptive Knowledge Management\\".

From these questions, he has worked on various specific research projects ranging from Biomedical Literature Mining and Social Media Mining to understanding redundancy, robustness, modularity and control in Complex Networks, Collective Intelligence on the Web and in Social Systems, and Agent- based models of Evolutionary Systems such as RNA Editing and Artificial Immune Systems.  Philosophical views  Rocha is a proponent of embodied and situated cognition and has defended the grounded epistemological stance of evolutionary constructivism. He is a proponent of the view that the threshold of complexity required for open-ended evolution requires an interplay between symbolic memory and dynamical machinery, i.e. a strict genotype-phenotype separation. This idea has been labeled semiotic closurePattee, H.H. \\"The Physics and Metaphysics of Biosemiotics.\\" Journal of Biosemiotics. 1:281-301, 2005. and is generally understood to fit in the area of biosemiotics. He has defended that this principle of organization is at play in cognition and human collective behavior, having developed web technology to implement the principle Clark, A.

The 18-karat gold watch has 24 complications and was assembled by Patek Philippe. It was named after banker Henry Graves Jr who commissioned it out of his desire to outdo the Grande Complication pocketwatch of American automaker James Ward Packard. The two were both at the top of the watch collecting world, regularly commissioning innovative new timepieces. It took three years to design, and another five years to manufacture the watch, which was delivered to Henry Graves on January 19, 1933. The Supercomplication was the world’s most complicated mechanical timepiece for more than 50 years, with a total of 24 different functions. These included Westminster chimes, a perpetual calendar, sunrise and sunset times, and a celestial map of New York as seen from the Graves's apartment on Fifth Avenue. The record was bested in 1989 when Patek Philippe released the Patek Philippe Calibre 89, but the Supercomplication remains the most complicated mechanical watch built without the assistance of computers. Henry Graves spent 60,000 Swiss francs (US$15,000) when he commissioned it in 1925. Adjusting for inflation, the sum is roughly US$202,000, measured in 2014 dollars. The Supercomplication previously held the title of the most expensive watch ever sold at auction, with a final price of 24 million US dollars (23,237,000 CHF) sold in Geneva on November 11, 2014 until the sale of the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime at the Only Watch charity auction at Christie's in Geneva in 2019. Auctions December 2, 1999 Henry Graves Jr. died in 1953. His daughter Gwendolen inherited the Supercomplication and in 1960 passed it to her son, Reginald ‘Pete’ Fullerton. In 1969, Fullerton sold the piece to Seth G. Atwood, founder of the \\"Time Museum\\" and an industrialist from Illinois, for US$200,000 (equal to some US$1.2 million today). After that, the watch had been kept in the Time Museum in Rockford, Illinois, one of the leading horological museums in the world, which was shut down in March 1999. (From January 2001 through February 2004, some of the Time Museum collection was displayed at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, then sold.) The watch was held in the Rockford Time Museum until it was sold at Sotheby's for a record breaking $11,002,500 to an anonymous bidder in New York City on December 2, 1999. The owner was later known to be a member of the Qatari Royal Family, Sheikh Saud bin Muhammed Al Thani. Prince Sheikh Saud died on November 9, 2014, and the watch was sent to auction again. November 11, 2014 On July 10, 2014, Sotheby's announced that in November 2014, the pocket watch would once again be auctioned. On November 11, 2014, the watch was sold in Geneva, Switzerland. The final price, bid by Aurel Bacs serving as proxy for an anonymous entity, reached 23,237,000 Swiss Francs, equivalent to US$24 million at the time. The sum was the highest price that anyone has ever paid for a timepiece, including both pocket watches and wrist watches. Construction and complications The timepiece contains 920 individual parts, with 430 screws, 110 wheels, 120 removable parts, and 70 jewels, all of them handcrafted on a tiny scale. The timepiece is a gold, double-dialled and double-openfaced, minute repeating clockwatch with Westminster chimes, grande and petite sonnerie, split seconds chronograph, registers for 60-minutes and 12-hours, perpetual calendar accurate to the year 2100, moon-phases, equation of time, dual power reserve for striking and going trains, mean and sidereal time, central alarm, indications for times of sunrise/sunset and a celestial chart for the night time sky of New York City at 40 degrees 41.0 minutes North latitude. Its diameter is 74mm; thickness of case with glass 36mm; and weight of case 536g. The Supercomplication features the following 24 functions.

It has been widely used in population health surveys, clinical studies, economic evaluation and in routine outcome measurement in the delivery of operational healthcare. EQ-5D is designed for self-completion and as such captures information directly from the respondent, thereby generating data that conforms with the general requirement of all Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures. Alternative modes of administration have also been developed. Its ease of use and standardized use have resulted in its inclusion in 1,000s of peer-reviewed papers over the past 20 years. The overwhelming majority of these have appeared in clinical journals. When used in economic evaluation EQ-5D preference weights are combined with time to compute quality-adjusted life years (QALY). QALYs gained is used as the outcome in cost-utility analysis which is a type of economic evaluation that compares the benefit and cost of health care programs or interventions. Many countries generated a value set (preference weights) of their own population and have used it for estimating QALY to make decisions in resource allocation. There are currently 171 language versions of EQ-5D questionnaire available. EQ-5D is one of the most commonly used generic health status measurement, and its good validity and reliability have been reported in various health conditions.  Development of the questionnaire  EQ-5D was first introduced in 1990 by the EuroQol Group. This group was initially formed in 1987 with the researchers of multidisciplinary areas from five European countries; Netherlands, UK, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. They worked cooperatively with the aim of developing an instrument which is not specific to disease but standardized and can be used as a complement for existing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures. Other required characteristics of the new instrument were capable of being sent as a postal questionnaire for self-completion, easy to complete, applicable to everyone, can produce a single index value, and can take into account the health status ‘worse than dead’.  Components  The EQ-5D questionnaire has two components: health state description and evaluation. In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in \\"work, study, housework, family or leisure activities\\". In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self- rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale. In the evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).  Descriptive system  =EQ-5D-3L= When EQ-5D was first developed, the scale used in the health state description part was three-level; having no problems, having some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. As an example, three levels of mobility dimension are phrased as \\"I have no problems in walking about\\", \\"I have some problems in walking about\\", and \\"I am confined to bed\\". The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). 12321 indicates having no problems in mobility and anxiety/depression, having slight problems in self-care and pain/discomfort, and having extreme problems in usual activities. There are potentially 243 (=35) different health states. = EQ-5D-Y = A 'youth version' of the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system was developed for self-completion by children and younger people. It includes equivalent dimensions to the original EQ-5D-3L, phrased so as to be more easily understood and relevant for younger people. The dimensions are: 'mobility', 'looking after myself', 'doing usual activities', 'having pain or discomfort' and 'feeling worried, sad or unhappy'. A later version of EQ-5D-Y, called the EQ-5D-Y-5L was developed as a 5-level 'youth' version. The EQ-5D-Y-5L aligned with the number of response options in the EQ-5D-5L. = EQ-5D-5L = Although its brevity contributed a lot for the wide use of EQ-5D, the three-level scale showed some limitations. The major drawback is that it has much fewer descriptive capability of health status compared to other generic instruments. For example, the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 and Mark 3 (HUI 2 and HUI 3) and the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) can define 24,000, 972,000, and 18,000 unique health states, while EQ-5D-3L can do only 243. As a consequence, it suffers from ceiling effects which are present when participants’ scores reach the best possible score of the instrument.Garin O. (2014) Ceiling Effect. In: Michalos A.C.

Pharmacoeconomics 33(11):1137–1154. doi: 10.1007/s40273-015-0295-6 To improve such constraints of the three-level scale, the new version of EQ-5D with five- level scale was developed (EQ-5D-5L). The number of levels of severity was increased to five in this new version; having no problems, having slight problems, having moderate problems, having severe problems and being unable to do/having extreme problems. The new version can define 3,125 (=55) different health states. Some of the wordings of the scale were revisited to be clearer and the instruction for EQ-VAS was simplified. No changes were made for the five dimensions. The validity and reliability of the EQ-5D have been assessed for the different language versions and various health conditions, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, COPD, asthma, and cardiovascular disease, and so on. The 5L system showed improved responsiveness compared to the 3L system, and also good validity and reliability . EQ-5D-5L has also been recommended to the elderly population as a generic health status measurement, in combination with other supplementary measurements to capture all related aspects in their quality-of-life.  Visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS)  Visual analogue scale is the second part of the questionnaire, asking to mark health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. There are notes at the both ends of the scale that the bottom rate (0) corresponds to \\" the worst health you can imagine\\", and the highest rate (100) corresponds to \\"the best health you can imagine\\". In the EQ-5D-3L version, the respondents has to draw a line from the box on the questionnaire to the scale indicates the health state of the interviewed day, while the EQ-5D-5L version asks to mark X on the scale to indicate the today's health and write the number of the scale marked in the empty box on the questionnaire. A well-known limitation of visual analogue scale is end-of-scale bias that respondents are less likely to use the extreme ends of the scale for rating their health status. However, it is still useful and the simplest direct method for valuing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) weights.  Valuation process  Once the health status is assessed from the description part, the 5-digit number can be converted into a preference weight which is also referred to as a single weighted index score. It can be done by using methods for generating HRQoL weights, such as visual analogue scale (VAS), the time-trade-off (TTO), and the standard gamble (SG). The choice of the valuation methods can vary. The initial purpose of having visual analogue scale in the EQ-5D questionnaire was to get preference weights using the scale, but the time-trade-off has become favored because it is a \\"choice task\\", not a \\"rating task\\" which easily involves some scaling bias. Time-trade-off is recommended when performing cost-utility analysis using quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as an outcome, but other methods could be chosen for different type of analyses. A value set was developed using time-trade-off in many countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Spain, Japan, and Germany. The index score of a value set derived from the general population sample can be regarded as a \\"societal valuation of the respondent's health state\\" in that country. In contrast, the scores from the visual analogue scale in the questionnaire indicates the respondent's own assessment of his/her health status\\". A value set derived from the general population sample has been criticized for a lack of a compelling theoretical support.

He died in battle. Douglas was the third son of George Douglas, 13th Earl of Morton. He joined the British Army in 1721 as an ensign in the 31st Foot, and became captain in 1732. When his father succeeded to the peerage in 1730, Douglas was returned unopposed in his place as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Orkney and Shetland at a by-election on 7 May 1730. He voted with the Administration on the army in 1732 and on the excise bill in 1733. He was returned unopposed again at the 1734 British general election. In March 1735, he found himself in conflict with the Administration and his father over an election petition. The petition was by William Piers and the ministry had set themselves to turn out the sitting Member, George Hamilton. Douglas voted in honesty and as his conscience dictated for Hamilton. Walpole threatened to take away his commission, and his father threatened to disinherit him but he refused to change his vote. He was still returned unopposed at the 1741 general election and voted consistently with the Administration. He spoke in favour of the Hanoverians in January 1744. Douglas rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the 3rd Foot Guards in 1740, Colonel in 1743, and also became aide-de-camp to King George II.

Early life His origins are humble. He earned a degree in Philosophy from the University of Salamanca in 1932. He was a Falangist from the beginning, and was awarded with the Palma de Plata by José Antonio Primo de Rivera in 1934. During those years, he was a journalist in the Falangist press and in the newspaper La Nación. He travelled as a correspondent to places like Ethiopia (during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War), where he met the German Wilhelm Oberbeil. Oberbeil was the one who introduced him to the Abwehr, a German military intelligence (information gathering) organization, in Berlin in 1935. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he was a prisoner in Larrínaga, Bilbao, but he succeeded in escaping.  Role in the Falange  He was a convinced Falangist. He began his involvement taking part in the Asturian miners' strike of 1934 as a reporter. He was awarded the above-mentioned prize, Palma de Plata, due to his work. It is important to highlight his work as a journalist in the Falangist press and in the newspaper La Nación. He was imprisoned in the prison of Bilbao, Larrínaga, for crimes against the Spanish Second Republic, because of his work as a gunman for the Falange (the Spanish Falangist movement). He was present at the time of the uprising of the Nationalist army on July 18, 1936. When he was due to be transferred he escaped from the prison and fled to the national zone. In 1937, he traveled to Salamanca as a correspondent at the front for an interview with Manuel Hedilla, National Leader of the Falange, who tried to gain support against those who had a sense of entitlement due to their proximity to José Antonio Primo de Rivera. The situation in Salamanca had divided the Nationalists in two. The Hedilla supporters, under the command of Agustín Aznar, Sancho Dávila and Rafael Dávila Garcerán, were backed by the Germans. Furthermore, rumors were spread from the headquarters of Francisco Franco to destroy and discredit both factions, before they then presented themselves as saviours. According to his memories, Alcázar de Velasco intuits this and therefore proposes, at least twice, to murder Francisco Franco. A few days later, a scuffle took place and two Falangists were killed. Franco is appointed to the position of maximum command by headquarters in order to unify the Nationalists and avoid an internal war. Alcázar was arrested for participating in the events, tried for \\"military rebellion\\" and sentenced to life imprisonment. After going through several prisons, he ended up in Fort San Cristobal, Pamplona. There, he was caught up in one of the major escapes of republican prisoners in the Spanish Civil War, and escaped to Pamplona to warn about the events. As a result, the sentence was reduced to just two years. In January 1940 he was appointed press officer of the Institute of Political Studies in Madrid thanks to his friendship with Ramón Serrano. Alcazar decides to talk to the British Ambassador Samuel Hoare, presenting himself as a radical Falangist with opposing ideas to Francoist Spain. In the summer of 1940 he travels to London, where he arrived as a press officer at the Spanish Embassy in London.  Cooperation with the Third Reich  In January 1940, he meets Oberbeil due to his friendship with Ramón Serrano Suñer, who suggests that he goes to London as a spy for the German intelligence service Abwehr. While other Spaniard Miguel Piernavieja, takes charge of sending reports to the Germans, Alcázar de Velasco created a spy network in Spain. His main objective in this task was to inform about the traffic of British ships, to gain information from the staff of British embassies and, eventually, to come up with a plan in order to blow up the Rock of Gibraltar. To do this, Wilhelm Canaris came to Spain. Piernavieja was dismissed from his post because he led a lax life, and was sent to the Blue Division. Alcazar narrates in his memories that he usually visited the places that were bombed in London and gave information to the Germans for future attacks, and organized anti-Francoist guerrillas in order to send them to Spain. The Spanish embassy in London did not have good security measures, so most of the information was intercepted by the MI5, the British Security Service. That same year, in autumn, Alcázar made contact with Charles de Gaulle as a member of Abwehr during a mission in which Alcazar had to send several million pounds to help the Free France organization and to devalue the British currency. In his memories, Alcázar de Velasco shows his thoughts about the World War and also shows his esoteric personality: a conflict between the hidden powers of Wel that were represented by the national socialists who defended European Civilization against the Jewish’ Kahal. He is profoundly anti-semitic and thinks that the allies and the Soviet Union form part of an international Jewish conspiracy. In March 1941, Alcázar began working for Walter Schellenberg, who was the espionage boss of the SS, RSHA. Because of this, Alcázar got involved in Operation Willi, in which the people who worked for Walter Schellenberg tried to kidnap the Duke of Windsor in Portugal. In 1944, he traveled to Germany and worked again for the SS and helped them purge the Abwehr, association which had been broken up due to the Solf case Solf Kreis) in February (of the same year). Alcázar stayed in Berlín until the end of World War II. He narrates in his memories that he stayed at the Chancellery bunker until 24 April 1945. After that, he was able to escape to Switzerland and was repatriated to Spain. After his arrival in Spain, he kept working for the Third Reich helping them escape from Germany. Most were national socialist leaders the most famous one being Martin Bormann.  Tõ Network  Ángel Alcázar began working for the Japanese shortly after coming back from Madrid in what is known as his most ambitious project: the Tõ network (東機関). Japan desperately needed information on the allies; Japanese and German espionage networks in the United States were being dismantled and Japan needed agents to keep them informed, especially in the United States. This need is what brought Spain into the picture since it had some hard to find qualities, such a close relationship with Latin America. That's why Ramón Serrano suggested to the Japanese that they hire Alcázar, they saw Alcázar as the right man for the job not only because of Serrano's recommendation, but also thanks to the fact that time was a scarce resource. They also took advantage of his espionage network in London that led to the future creation of another in the United States. That's how shortly after arriving in Madrid in early January, Alcázar began working for the Japanese by sending them reports entitled \\"Tō Network\\". The Tō Network generated more information than any other espionage network in the United States. But it is important to emphasise that the quality was not as good as the quantity. The information that Alcázar was selling to the Japanese and the Germans left a lot to be desired, and most of this information was made up by Alcázar. However, the Japanese didn't seem to notice and even if they did, they preferred to keep receiving information, information that the Americans already knew were being sent out. As they would reveal after the allied victory, the USA was always aware of Alcázar's movements, while also undervaluing him as a spy. As was disclosed in the \\"Magic Summaries\\", the info the Japanese had was always easily decoded by the USA since the beginning — this was thanks to the acquisition of the codes. The Tõ network was made up, according to Alcázar's memories, of 21 agents. This, however, has always been the object of debate, as some authors are convinced that it was just an invention. Others, on the other hand, believed that the existence of these agents could be true. The Tõ network lost all its credibility in an attempt to turn the tide of World War II at the beginning of 1943 when Alcázar and Suñer tried to make the Japanese believe that there was an attempt to make peace with the USA without Japan. The Japanese, alarmed by this turn of events, checked this information asking some of the participants (such as Ribbentrop). These participants denied any meeting of the sort. After this, Alcázar, and in less measure Suñer, lost their credibility in Japan. Strangely enough, even after this incident, Japan continued to buy information from Spain. It is believed that this was due to their extreme need for information on the enemy and, due to a shortage of resources, their inability to acquire it. The reason behind this plot was to make Japan attack Russia so that the tide of the war could change. Japan continued buying information from Alcázar until the end of the war, even though he was by then considered little more than a liar.  Activity after the war  Once the World War II finished, he worked as a journalist: first, for the newspaper La Tarde. Then, as a correspondent in Paris and Buenos Aires. Later, as the director of the Literary Supplement in a Mexican newspaper. After that, as a special reporter for a French press agency around the world. And lastly, for the Francoist press. However, in his memoirs he himself admits he did not abandon espionage until 1958. Ángel Alcázar de Velasco died in May 2001 at the age of 92 years in the locality.

It was built by the Spanish authorities in 1880 with a capacity of 15 million gallons to provide the residents of Manila and its surrounding areas with an adequate water supply. The reservoir was historically known as the site where the onset of the Philippine Revolution through the Battle of San Juan del Monte took place in 1896. History The El Deposito was built as part of the Carriedo Waterworks which was built from 1878 to 1882 under the supervision of Genaro Palacios, a Spanish engineer and architect who also decided to use the Marikina River as the El Deposito's water source. The underground reservoir held military strategic importance. During the Philippine Revolution, the Katipunan attempted to seize the El Deposito from Spanish colonial authorities in the Battle of San Juan del Monte in 1896 and was held by Filipinos during the Philippine-American war. It was used as an armory; by the Americans during the colonial administration, and by the Imperial Japanese forces during their occupation of the Philippines in World War II. It was also used as a pulmonary hospital specifically for tuberculosis patients and as a firing range. El Deposito was recaptured by the Allied forces in 1945 but later fell to disuse after the war and the Philippine independence from the United States. Efforts to rehabilitate the underground reservoir began in 2016 when the University of the Philippines Archaeological Studies program conducted an assessment and excavation of the structure. The National Historical Commission of the Philippines conducted cleaning of the El Deposito's tunnel in 2018 as a preparation for the development of the site as a tourist destination It is planned to be open to the public in 2020. Water supply When the El Deposito was still in use as a water supply storage, it had a capacity of for 300,000 people. Ventilation shaft were also utilized to keep water fresh and free from contamination. As part of the Carriedo waterworks system, the reservoir also supplied water to hydrants and fountains in Manila. As part of the Carriedo water system, the El Deposito sources its water from the Marikina River. Water was pumped out from the river to the water reservoir through a cast iron pipes which passes through the Santolan area. The structure of the water reservoir which situated below an elevated hill consists of a vast central canal that is connected to 25 smaller canals which measure high and wide each. Cultural Property On August 30, 1972, a marker was installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines in recognition of the old reservoir as a cultural property. In commemoration of the first battle of the Philippine Revolution, the land along El Deposito was converted into a recreational park named the Pinaglabanan Memorial Shrine and Park.

Eventually production was restarted with attempts to build co- production arrangements with film-makers in other countries. In late 1950 Scalera opened a distribution subsidiary in the United States, but then suddenly collapsed financially during the shooting of Othello, and the company was formally liquidated two years later; the American office, which had acquired reissue rights for 70 films formerly handled by Superfilm Distributing Corp., was closed before the end of 1951.

They uphold the four pillars of sustainability, namely: * social sustainability * environmental sustainability * economic sustainability * good governance They commit to upholding Ecological Sustainable Development (ESD), with the six principles being: * precautionary principle, important in all decision-making to minimise negative and unacceptable risk; * inter- generational equity, ensuring future generations have a sustainable future; * intra-generational equity, which means social equity and economic justice for all people; * integration of environmental, economic and social aspects into decision-making with institutional sustainability and good governance and ensuring mechanisms and institutions are in place to foster this integration; * conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity as being fundamental to the maintenance of healthy, productive and functioning ecosystems, and providing humans with their basic needs and by maintaining ecosystem services; * improved valuation, pricing and incentive mechanisms so as to ensure that environmental factors are included in the valuation of assets and services., e.g. putting a monetary value on ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. They are committed to the PNG Population Policy. They promise to minimise or negate their carbon footprint. They strive to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, which are: * Eradicate Extreme Hunger and Poverty * Achieve Universal Primary Education * Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women * Reduce Child Mortality * Improve Maternal Health * Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases * Ensure Environmental Sustainability * Develop a Global Partnership for Development PNG Greens Party is committed to raising PNG's Human Development Index (HDI) with a target of being in the top 50 countries in the world by 2030. PNG Greens Party promises to campaign against violence against all individuals, in particular women and children. Within their mission statement the PNG Greens reject enforcement of limiting population growth by any enforcement means. They believe population growth can be limited by the following means: * protection of free choice in sexual and reproductive health; * improve literacy, numeracy, and health * provide sex education; * provide free contraception * remove a laws that inhibit people's contraceptive choices * Make all people legally equal regardless of sexual orientation, whether male or female. They recognise the need to improve the lives of people living in rural settlements within PNG. They state in their mission statement that PNG has \\"amongst the highest biodiversity and cultural diversity amongst all countries of the world.\\" and that they are \\"committed to maintaining that diversity and oppose all policies which reduce either.\\" They support increasing the number of conservation protected areas, and involving a co-operative management approach between local communities, NGOs, and the government. They also supports the establishment of more WMAs, and more locally managed marine protected areas. They would like to use these initiatives to increase eco-tourism. It will promote more eco-businesses, with this same aim. PNG Greens believe financial assistance from government, NGOs, business groups and others is needed to manage protected areas, and to stamp out inappropriate development. Papua New Guinea has one of the most significant timber resources in Asia. In the last 2 decades, PNG logging has see the most forest loss and degradation in the world. PNG Greens oppose unsustainable logging practices and clear felling of PNG's forests. The PNG Greens are committed to enforcing forestry standards which are the law. They wish to implement more policies in support of community and eco-forestry practices which are sustainable. They oppose unsustainable agriculture. They propose for all SABLs to be immediately rescinded. The PNG Greens call attention to the fact that hydrocarbons are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. They call for immediate policy change to ensure that benefits of extraction companies within PNG are seen by all citizens of PNG. If elected they will immediately stop dumping of mine wastes into rivers and the sea. They will strive to match greenhouse gas contributions with complementary/ conservation offsets. and REDD activities. PNG Greens support policies to mitigate environmental pollution of rivers, lakes, and marine areas.  Constitution   Motto  The motto of the PNG Greens is \\"Changing the way the world communicates.\\"  Objectives  # Ensure human activity does not impair biodiversity and the ecological resilience of life supporting systems # To strive for participatory democracy where all citizens have freedom of expression, and are able to participate directly in economic, social, and environmental issues which affect them. Where power and responsibilities are locally and regionally concentrated, so that higher tiers of government make decisions where absolutely necessary, which requires that: ## Individuals are empowered with the access to all the required information to make necessary decisions, and all have access to education to allow participation. ## Wealth and power inequalities are diminished to ensure equal ability to participate. ## Grassroots institutions are put in place to enable decisions to be made on a local level, by those affected. These institutions would be based on a system which encourages volunteering, civil vitality and communal responsibility. ## Electoral systems are democratic and transparent, and this is enforced within legislation. ## Each adult has one vote, and all votes are equal. ## Electoral systems are built on proportional representation, all elections are publicly funded, and any corporate and private donation is fully transparent and strictly legislated. ## All citizens have the right to choose what political party they are a member of, within a multi-party system. # Social justice: distributing of social and natural resources, both locally and internationally, to unconditionally meet basic human rights. Also to ensure that all citizens have equal opportunities for social and personal development by ensuring: ## We \\"eradicate poverty by developing initiatives that address the causes as well as the system of poverty\\". ## Citizenship is based on the idea of equal rights, irrespective of gender, age, class, religion, disability, ethnic or national origin, wealth, or health. # Non-violence: committed to non-violence and striving for global peace and cooperation. Security should be not be measured in terms of military strength, but of sound economic and social development, upholding human rights, environmental safety, requiring: ## A policy of non-violent conflict resolution, with a self-reliant non-nuclear defence policy. ## A global security system committed to preventing and managing conflicts. ## Remove main causes of conflict by respecting and understanding different cultures, promoting freedom and democracy, ending poverty, and eradicating racism. # Sustainability: Recognise the limits of global material expansion, and the need to achieve sustainability of both renewable and non-renewable sources, in order to provide this and future generations with a habitable environment, which requires us to: ## Limit consumption by wealthy people to ensure all have a fair share of resources. ## Reduce causes of population growth by giving economic security, access to education and health services, and greater control over fertility choices for both males and females. ## To measure national wealth in terms of quality of life, as opposed to the capacity for over-consumption. ## Provide aims designed to satisfy the needs for all, not the greed of a few, enabling present generations to meet their needs without jeopardising future generations. ## Enforce transnational corporations to support the principles of sustainable development. ## Apply tax mechanisms to speculative financial flow, as well as increased tax regulation. # Respect diversity, by honouring cultural, religious, sexual, ethical, linguistic and spiritual diversity with onus of individuals to be responsible towards all beings. Defend every person's rights indiscriminately, upholding their dignity, health and well- being, and promote responsible, respectful, and positive relationships across all walks of life within a multi-cultural community. This requires: ## Recognise rights of indigenous people, including right to land, self- determination, and acknowledgement of their cultural contributions. ## Recognise rights of ethnic minorities to develop culturally, socially, and to use a language of their preference and full legal right to participate democratically. ## Promote gender equality. # Political Actions: ## Encourage grassroots movements, and other organisations which strive for democratic, transparent, civil society, and accountable governments locally and globally. ## Support young people to have a democratic say in society, through positive encouragement to participate and education. ## Push for \\"certification of the organisastion for Economic co_operation and Development (OECD) convention on combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business.\\" ## Make it a right for all citizens to have access to free official information, and access to independent media. ## Strive towards universal access to electronic communications, and IT, starting with radio and community-based email and internet. ## Put in place a fair and just, secular legal system. Give citizens the right of defence, and proportionality between crime and punishment. ## Hold publicly funded elections. ## Ensure all electoral donations are fully transparent. ## Cap electoral donations from a single person. ## Ban party political and electoral donations from private organisations. ## Challenge corporate domination of government, which denies citizens their right to participate democratically. ## Support separation of legal, executive, and judicial systems. ## Separate state from religion. # Globalisation: ## Facilitate a fair trading arrangement between all nations. ## Increase development assistance to 3rd World countries. ## Abolish third world debt. ## Oppose human rights violations and political oppression.  Other Terms  The constitution also contains terms of voting on policy, membership, funding, parliamentary representation, by-laws, and a variety of other topics.  Electoral representation  In 2012, the PNG Greens Party had put forward candidates in many areas, notably in Madang province, where the party endorsed candidates for all of the seven seats.

The company designs and manufactures copper indium gallium deselenide (CIGS) photovoltaics. Siva Power is based in San Jose, California. Bruce Sohn is CEO and Mark Heising is Chairman. History The company was founded in 2006 as Solexant (one of the founders was Paul Alivisatos) and was developing cadmium telluride (CdTe) technology to create solar panels. After the Chinese began dumping silicon solar panels and the American thin-film market worsened, the company decided to pivot and in 2011 hired Brad Mattson to take Solexant in a new direction, which he restarted in 2012. Mattson put the company into stealth mode and ramped up the R&D; budget to find a different technology and process for manufacturing solar modules. In 2013 the company reemerged as Siva Power, developing CIGS photovoltaic technology. Technology Siva Power's deposition technique is Rapid Thermal Co- evaporation, which deposits the CIGS compound alloy film by direct reactive condensation of vapors of its constituent elements (copper, indium, gallium, and selenium) onto the substrate, for which Siva Power uses glass. Siva Power has said its initial production capacity of a single line would be 400 megawatts of modules per annum, whereas typical pilot production lines tend to be 5 to 30 megawatts. Department of Energy SunShot Initiative Award In 2014, Siva Power won the US Department of Energy SunShot Initiative award under the SunShot SolarMat2 category for driving down the cost of manufacturing and implementing efficiency-increasing technology in manufacturing processes for solar modules. The manufacturing component Siva Power plans to build through the SunShot award are designed to have a 12x higher areal (e.g.: m2/min) manufacturing throughput than other CIGS deposition tools, enabling a fully automated CIGS deposition system at a 3x reduction in capex, labor, and overhead cost. Team While in stealth mode, Robert Wendt, former CTO of XsunX and one of the early pioneers of coevaporated CIGS technology, joined as Vice President of Process and Equipment Development. He began Siva’s CIGS program establishing the company's initial CIGS process capability. When Siva Power came out of stealth, it also announced that energy-security expert and former Director of the CIA James Woolsey had joined its board of directors. Shortly after, Siva Power hired Dr. Markus Beck, former Chief Scientist of First Solar and Solyndra, to be Siva Power’s CTO. Dr. Billy J. \\"BJ\\" Stanbery, former CEO and founder of HelioVolt, joined Siva Power as President in March 2015. Siva Power announced in May 2015 that Chris McDonald, a factory operations expert from Applied Materials' Solar Business Group and Intel, would become its COO. In 2016, Siva hired Bruce Sohn, former President of First Solar who was instrumental in driving First Solar from startup to billion-dollar company, as its Vice Chairman of the Board. Sohn became CEO in 2017. Technical Advisory Board Siva Power has also assembled a technical advisory board composed of Dr. Rommel Noufi, Dr. Charlie Gay, Dr. Markus Beck, John Benner, Dr. Bulent Basol, Scott Thomsen, Dr. BJ Stanbery and Dr. Vivek Lall, all photovoltaic and materials experts. Noufi was the Principal Scientist of the CIGS technology group at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and is a consulting professor at Stanford University. Gay was the former director of NREL and served as President of Applied Materials Solar Division. Dr. Gay left Siva's advisory board in 2016 when he joined the DOE as Director of the SunShot Program, so as to avoid conflict of interest Benner is the Executive Director of the Bay Area Photovoltaic Consortium, an industry-led consortium managed by Stanford and UC Berkeley charged with funding next-generation PV research at US universities and national laboratories with funds from both the US DoE and its industry members, and Basol has more than 30 years of experience in photovoltaics, beginning with Monosolar, one of the first solar companies. Scott Thomsen is a glass materials expert who ran Guardian Industries global glass group as the company President, having previously served as the company's Head of North American glass operations and CTO. Funding and Acquisitions When the company was Solexant and developing CdTe technology, it had raised $60M over 3 rounds of venture funding from X Seed Capital, Acero Capital (formerly Olympus Capital), Medley Partners, Birchmere Ventures, Trident Capital, Firelake Capital, and DBL Investors. In 2011, Solexant acquired Wakonda, a solar startup based in New York. The company was recapitalized with $7M in 2015 in series D preferred equity investments from DBL, Medley, Acero and the city of Wuxi, China. In 2016, the company added $5M more to the series D investment. A $25M Series E round, led by Renaissance Technologies hedge fund manager Jim Simons, was closed in May 2017 for the purpose of funding a pilot line.

He was the winner of the National Literature Prize in 2004. Biography Andrés L. Mateo was born in Santo Domingo in 1946. The son of Antonio Mateo Peguero and Guadalupe Martínez Reyes, his primary education studies were at the Colegio San Juan Bosco, where he wrote his first novel, Pisando los dedos de Dios. He then attended high school at the Liceo Juan Pablo Duarte, where he was the first student leader of the Asociación Nacional de Estudiantes de Liceos Intermedios; he also served as an assistant to the philosopher Armando Cordero. While studying at the lyceum, he began writing for El Caribe, which published his first poems. In 1965, he founded the La Isla group, composed of young writers who looked to art and culture in social transformations occurring in Dominican Republic as inspiration. Members of the group included Wilfredo Lozano, Norberto James Rawling, Antonio Lockward Artiles, Fernando Sánchez Martínez, Jorge Lara and José Ulises Rutinell Domínguez. Mateo received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo. In 1971, he went to Cuba to study and in 1977 he obtained a degree in American Literature at the University of Havana. In 1993, he received a Ph.D. in Philological Sciences at the university for his work on the myths and culture of the Dominican Republican capital of Santo Domingo. In 1978, Mateo returned to the Dominican Republic where he became a prolific writer in the national newspapers, and was appointed co-director of Coloquio literary supplement to the newspaper El Siglo. He became a Professor of literature at the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo. In 1981, he was awarded the National Novel Prize by the Ministry of Education, Fine Arts and Culture for Pisar los dedos de Dios. His 1992 novel, La Balada de Alfonsina Bairán, also won an award, and in 1994, he received the National Essay Prize for his essay on Mito y Cultura en la Era de Trujillo. In 1999, he received the Dominican Journalistic Excellence Award for his newspaper column \\"Sobre el tiempo presente\\", published in Listin Diario. He won the National Literature Prize in 2004. Other novels include La otra Penélope (1982) and El Violín de la Adúltera (The Violin of Adultery) (2007); the latter is based on real incidents which occurred in the Don Bosco neighborhood where Mateo grew up. Mataeo's novel La balada de Alfonsina Bairán is set in a brothel during the Trujillo regime. Along with Tony Raful and Pedro Peix, Mateo hosted the television programme titled \\"Peria de Tres\\" (Circle of Three). Views Mateo has observed that in the Dominican Republic under the dictatorial regime of Rafael Trujillo, the cultural aspect of Dominican history received a prominent place. He also noted that there was a pessimistic view in the country on the development and furtherance of social norms caused by political factors; particularly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when there was a \\"Golden age\\" perception of the country. Mateo in his article published in the Listín Diario has highlighted the period of terror and fear inflicted on the people of the country during the period 1930-1961, and bemoans that Trujillism had frighteningly become bigger than Trujillo himself, which had denied freedom of thought to the people and the press.

Definition of the Steiner generation of a conic section The Steiner conic or more precisely Steiner's generation of a conic, named after the Swiss mathematician Jakob Steiner, is an alternative method to define a non- degenerate projective conic section in a projective plane over a field. The usual definition of a conic uses a quadratic form (see Quadric (projective geometry)). Another alternative definition of a conic uses a hyperbolic polarity. It is due to K. G. C. von Staudt and sometimes called a von Staudt conic. The disadvantage of von Staudt's definition is that it only works when the underlying field has odd characteristic (i.e., Char e2).

Perspective mapping between lines A perspective mapping pi of a pencil B(U) onto a pencil B(V) is a bijection (1-1 correspondence) such that corresponding lines intersect on a fixed line a, which is called the axis of the perspectivity pi (figure 2). A projective mapping is a finite product of perspective mappings. Simple example: If one shifts in the first diagram point U and its pencil of lines onto V and rotates the shifted pencil around V by a fixed angle varphi then the shift (translation) and the rotation generate a projective mapping pi of the pencil at point U onto the pencil at V. From the inscribed angle theorem one gets: The intersection points of corresponding lines form a circle. Examples of commonly used fields are the real numbers R, the rational numbers Q or the complex numbers C. The construction also works over finite fields, providing examples in finite projective planes. Remark: The fundamental theorem for projective planes states, that a projective mapping in a projective plane over a field (pappian plane) is uniquely determined by prescribing the images of three lines. That means that, for the Steiner generation of a conic section, besides two points U,V only the images of 3 lines have to be given. These 5 items (2 points, 3 lines) uniquely determine the conic section. Remark: The notation \\"perspective\\" is due to the dual statement: The projection of the points on a line a from a center Z onto a line b is called a perspectivity (see below). 3. Example of a Steiner generation: generation of a point  Example  For the following example the images of the lines a,u,w (see picture) are given: pi(a)=b, pi(u)=w, pi(w)=v. The projective mapping pi is the product of the following perspective mappings pi_b,pi_a: 1) pi_b is the perspective mapping of the pencil at point U onto the pencil at point O with axis b. 2) pi_a is the perspective mapping of the pencil at point O onto the pencil at point V with axis a. First one should check that pi=pi_api_b has the properties: pi(a)=b, pi(u)=w, pi(w)=v. Hence for any line g the image pi(g)=pi_api_b(g) can be constructed and therefore the images of an arbitrary set of points. The lines u and v contain only the conic points U and V resp.. Hence u and v are tangent lines of the generated conic section. A proof that this method generates a conic section follows from switching to the affine restriction with line w as the line at infinity, point O as the origin of a coordinate system with points U,V as points at infinity of the x- and y-axis resp. and point E=(1,1). The affine part of the generated curve appears to be the hyperbola y=1/x. Remark: #The Steiner generation of a conic section provides simple methods for the construction of ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas which are commonly called the parallelogram methods. #The figure that appears while constructing a point (figure 3) is the 4-point-degeneration of Pascal's theorem.  Steiner generation of a dual conic  dual ellipse Steiner generation of a dual conic definition of a perspective mapping  Definitions and the dual generation  Dualizing (see duality (projective geometry)) a projective plane means exchanging the points with the lines and the operations intersection and connecting. The dual structure of a projective plane is also a projective plane. The dual plane of a pappian plane is pappian and can also be coordinatized by homogenous coordinates. A nondegenerate dual conic section is analogously defined by a quadratic form. A dual conic can be generated by Steiner's dual method: *Given the point sets of two lines u,v and a projective but not perspective mapping pi of u onto v. Then the lines connecting corresponding points form a dual non-degenerate projective conic section. A perspective mapping pi of the point set of a line u onto the point set of a line v is a bijection (1-1 correspondence) such that the connecting lines of corresponding points intersect at a fixed point Z, which is called the centre of the perspectivity pi (see figure). A projective mapping is a finite sequence of perspective mappings. It is usual, when dealing with dual and common conic sections, to call the common conic section a point conic and the dual conic a line conic. In the case that the underlying field has Char =2 all the tangents of a point conic intersect in a point, called the knot (or nucleus) of the conic. Thus, the dual of a non-degenerate point conic is a subset of points of a dual line and not an oval curve (in the dual plane). So, only in the case that Char e2 is the dual of a non-degenerate point conic a non-degenerate line conic.  Examples  Dual Steiner conic defined by two perspectivities pi_A, pi_B example of a Steiner generation of a dual conic (1) Projectivity given by two perspectivities: Two lines u,v with intersection point W are given and a projectivity pi from u onto v by two perspectivities pi_A,pi_B with centers A,B. pi_A maps line u onto a third line o, pi_B maps line o onto line v (see diagram). Point W must not lie on the lines overline{AB},o. Projectivity pi is the composition of the two perspectivities:  pi=pi_Bpi_A. Hence a point X is mapped onto pi(X)=pi_Bpi_A(X) and the line x=overline{Xpi(X)} is an element of the dual conic defined by pi. (If W would be a fixpoint, pi would be perspective H. Lenz: Vorlesungen über projektive Geometrie, BI, Mannheim, 1965, S. 49..) (2) Three points and their images are given: The following example is the dual one given above for a Steiner conic. The images of the points A,U,W are given: pi(A)=B, , pi(U)=W,, pi(W)=V. The projective mapping pi can be represented by the product of the following perspectivities pi_B,pi_A: :1) pi_B is the perspectivity of the point set of line u onto the point set of line o with centre B. :2) pi_A is the perspectivity of the point set of line o onto the point set of line v with centre A. One easily checks that the projective mapping pi=pi_Api_B fulfills pi(A)=B,, pi(U)=W, , pi(W)=V. Hence for any arbitrary point G the image pi(G)=pi_Api_B(G) can be constructed and line overline{Gpi(G)} is an element of a non degenerate dual conic section. Because the points U and V are contained in the lines u, v resp.,the points U and V are points of the conic and the lines u,v are tangents at U,V.

History The station was originally opened in 1913, as one of the original Line A stations opened that year. The station was unusual for the network in the sense that it only had one platform, serving only trains heading towards Plaza de Mayo, with the opposite platform located some metres away at Alberti station. The station in 1913. Given its proximity to Pasco's northern platform (located just 124 metres away), both Alberti Norte and Pasco Sur stations were closed in 1953 in order to improve the line's frequency, since the close proximity of stations in that part of the line meant that trains could never accelerate to full speed before having to stop again.Los 95 años de la \\"línea A\\" - Info Almagro Upon the closure of the station, passengers could still see the unaltered station for many years from the line's trains.

When the Underground services were privatised by concession to Metrovías in the 1990s, the company closed up the platform and turned it into an electrical substation for the line.

Urban myths There are a number of urban myths surrounding the station. The most popular of these claims that when the station was being built, two railway workers were buried alive and their deaths were covered up and never reported to the local media. Subte workers and passengers of the line claim that if one takes the last train of the line (23:30) then the railway workers can be seen on the platform, with shovels in hand, following the gaze of passengers until the train passed. Another myth claims that if the lights went out on the old La Brugeoise cars when passing the station, one could see passengers dressed in period clothing waiting on the platform.

Found throughout most states, the species is a member of the genus Camponotus, a cosmopolitan genus of ants commonly known as carpenter ants. It was formally described and named by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858. These ants are characterised by their black head, reddish-brown mesosoma and black gaster, which can change in colour. The species is polymorphic: workers and soldiers measure and males are . The queens are the largest members of the colony, measuring . Colonies dwell in dry regions, including open areas or in dry sclerophyll woodland, where they nest in soil, large mounds or under stones. Nuptial flight occurs in summer and nests can hold several thousand individuals. Considered a household pest, black-headed sugar ants feed on sweet foods and insects and tend to butterfly larvae. Numerous birds and fish prey on these ants. Taxonomy The black-headed sugar ant was described from a holotype worker by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his 1858 publication Catalogue of the hymenopterous insects in the collection of the British Museum. Part VI. Formicidae, and was originally placed in the genus Formica. The specific name, nigriceps, is derived from the Latin words niger black\\", and ceps, abbreviated form of caput \\"head\\" when used in a compound word. Some years later, the species was assigned to the genus Camponotus by German entomologist Julius Roger. In 1887, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery described a subspecies, Camponotus nigriceps lividipes, based on collections of smaller ants. In 1933, William Morton Wheeler classified the black-headed sugar ant as a subspecies of the banded sugar ant (Camponotus consobrinus), but it was later revived as a full species in 1934. The ant is a member of the Camponotus nigriceps species group, which also includes C. clarior, C. consobrinus, C. dryandrae, C. eastwoodi, C. loweryi, C. longideclivis, C. pallidiceps and C. prostans. Description Closeup side view profile of a specimen worker Ants of this species are relatively large; it is a polymorphic species with two castes of workers, known as minor workers and major workers (soldiers). Workers and soldiers range in sizes from . Males measure and queens are the largest, measuring . Workers and soldiers of the subspecies Camponotus nigriceps lividipes only grow to . Workers' gasters and mesosomi can vary in colour; the gaster can be black, brown or yellowish-brown while the mesosoma is either reddish-brown or yellow. Workers are mostly brown with light patches noticeable on the head and mesosoma, and their clypei and mandibles are even darker; the legs are either black or brown. A large number of hairs grow from the gaster, mesonotum, pronotum and propodeum. On average, individual hairs are long. Golden, erect setae are present under the head and on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia are short in comparison to setae on the mesosoma. The workers' eyes bulge while soldiers' eyes are flat. Within the Camponotus nigriceps species group, the black-headed sugar ant can be easily mistaken for a banded sugar ant due to its similar appearance, but the latter are darker and have a band wrapping around their gaster, a feature absent on the black-headed sugar ant. Minor worker specimens are usually examined when trying to identify similar-looking species. Distribution and habitat The black-headed sugar ant can be found in most Australian states. The species is restricted to the north and south-east of Queensland, and is widespread throughout the Australian Capital Territory. The ant is also widespread throughout New South Wales and Victoria, but it is not found in the north-west of New South Wales and south-east of Victoria. In South Australia, it is commonly seen in the south-eastern regions and less encountered in the north-west. Populations are present in Western Australia, but they are not found in either the north regions of the state or in the Northern Territory. Black-headed sugar ants mostly live in dry regions including dry sclerophyll woodland or open areas, particularly in pastures. Other preferred habitats include mallee, eucalyptus woodland and Casuarina cristata woodland, at elevations ranging . Nests are found in laterite soil in upland areas, surrounded by tall eucalyptus trees or under groves. Nests can also be found in large mounds or under stones. Sometimes, cedar wood and large mounds occupied by the meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus) are inhabited by black-headed sugar ants. Behaviour and ecology Major workers attending to Ogyris genoveva pupae Black-headed sugar ants are nocturnal foragers of food. The species is sometimes considered a household pest since ants can enter human homes at night in search of food. During the day, these ants are not active and have exhibited sleep-like behaviours until it is night. The black-headed sugar ant predominantly feeds on sweet secretions and sugar water; insects and a variety of foodstuffs in human homes are also consumed. Workers use several social techniques during colony movements to other nest sites or to lead others to food sources, which includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running or laying down a pheromone trail for orientation. They are also attendants to the butterflies Ogyris idmo and Ogyris genoveva. The larvae will reside in underground areas constructed by attending ants, and during the night they will emerge with them and feed on mistletoe leaves. The species is tolerant to myrmecophiles; the beetles Ctenisophus morosus and Cryptodus paradoxus have been found in nests, and the wingless cricket Myrmecophilus australis also dwells inside colonies. Other insects which dwell inside nests include froghoppers in the family Cercopidae. Several birds and other predatory organisms prey on the black-headed sugar ant. Birds such as the black-faced woodswallow, rufous treecreeper, noisy miner, jacky winter and southern scrub robin prey on this species, as indicated by the fact that workers body parts have been found in the birds' stomach contents. Other predators of the black-headed sugar ant include the rainbow trout. Nuptial flight most likely begins during summer, as a young mated queen with no brood was found in a freshly built chamber in January. During the early years of colony foundation, there are more soldiers, and older colonies may have a workforce consisting only of minor workers. A typical colony may contain five to seven thousand individuals. Queens of the species can live for an exceptionally long time; wild queens can live for up to 21 years with one known captive living to 23 years of age, making it the second oldest recorded ant queen. Larvae of this species can grow to be quite large; collected larvae reach lengths of .

By 2 July 2016 a total of 48 people, including 20 foreign nationals, were killed in such attacks. These attacks were largely blamed on extremist groups such as Ansarullah Bangla Team and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The Bangladeshi government was criticized for its response to the attacks, which included charging and jailing some of the secularist bloggers for allegedly defaming some religious groups; or hurting the religious sentiments of different religious groups; or urging the bloggers to flee overseas. This strategy was seen by some as pandering to hard line elements within Bangladesh's Muslim majority population. About 89% of the population in Bangladesh is Muslim. The government's eventual successful crackdown in June 2016 was also criticized for its heavy-handedness, as more than 11,000 people were arrested in a little more than a week (as of 18 June 2016). Despite the criticism from some quarters, this menace was completely eliminated with no more major attacks or deaths in the subsequent period.  Background  In 2010 the government of Bangladesh, headed by the secularist Awami League, established a war crimes tribunal to investigate war crimes perpetrated during Bangladesh's bloody 1971 War of Independence from Pakistan. In February 2013 Abdul Quader Molla, a leader of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party (a small Islamist party within the opposition coalition), was sentenced to life imprisonment by the tribunal. The perceived mildness of the sentence was condemned by Bangladesh's secularist bloggers and writers, who helped organize the 2013 Shahbag protests in response, calling for the death penalty for Molla. The protestors quickly expanded their demands to include outlawing the Jamaat-e-Islami party itself for its role in the 1971 war. Shortly after the first Shahbag protests, counter-demonstrations, which quickly degenerated into violence, were organized by Islamist groups. Islamist leaders denounced the war crimes tribunal as political and called for an end to the prosecution of Jamaat-e-Islami leaders; they demanded instead the death penalty for secularist bloggers, denouncing them as \\"atheists\\" and accusing them of blasphemy. A spokesman for the secularist bloggers, Imran Sarker, stated that the hostility directed toward them by Islamists is due primarily to the bloggers' growing political influence in Bangladesh, which represents a major obstacle to the Islamist goal of a religious state. Though there were occasional attacks on secularists prior to the 2013 Shahbag protests, the frequency of attacks has increased since. Reporters Without Borders noted that in 2014 a group calling itself \\"Defenders of Islam\\" published a \\"hit list\\" of 84 Bangladeshis, mostly secularists, of whom nine have already reportedly been killed and others attacked. Responsibility for many of the attacks has been claimed by Ansarullah Bangla Team, a group that, according to police, has links with both the youth wing of Jamaat-e-Islami and al-Qaeda. The group has since been banned by the government. Other attacks appear to have been perpetrated by more obscure groups. Among some extremists, this violence is motivated by inceldom.  Government and international response  While police have arrested a number of suspects in the killings, and some bloggers have received police protection, the Bangladesh government has also responded by arresting and jailing a number of secularist bloggers for \\"defaming Islam\\" and by shutting down several websites. According to Sarker, \\"[T]he government has taken this easy route to appease a handful of mullahs whose support they need to win the upcoming election.\\" A number of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Reporters without Borders, PEN International, PEN Canada and the Committee to Protect Journalists have criticized the government for failing to protect its citizens and for not condemning the attacks, and have condemned the imprisonment of bloggers as an attack on free speech, which they say is contributing to a climate of fear for Bangladeshi journalists. \\"[T]he government is abandoning any serious claim that it is committed to free speech,\\" said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch.\\" In a petition published in The Guardian on 22 May 2015, 150 authors, including Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, and Yann Martell, called on the government of Bangladesh to put an end to the deadly attacks on bloggers, urging the Prime Minister and government \\"to do all in their power to ensure that the tragic events of the last three months are not repeated, and to bring the perpetrators to justice.\\" On 7 June 2016 Bangladeshi Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan alleged that the main opposition party BNP has links to the attacks, and that these attacks are part of a wider conspiracy that also involved Mossad, the national intelligence agency of Israel. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman in Jerusalem later rejected the allegation in a statement and termed the accusation of the Bangladeshi Home Minister as \\"utter drivel\\". The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, expressed concern on behalf of the United Nations on 13 June 2016 by saying, \\"I am very concerned about the dramatic increase in number of brutal murders in Bangladesh that target freethinkers, liberals, religious minorities and LGBT activists.\\" On 14 June 2016 approximately 100,000 Bangladeshi Muslim clerics released a fatwa, ruling that the murder of \\"non-Muslims, minorities and secular activists…forbidden in Islam\\".  Attacks on non-religious writers   Asif Mohiuddin  On 15 January 2013 Asif Mohiuddin, a self-described \\"militant atheist\\" blogger, was stabbed near his office in Motijheel, Dhaka. He survived the attack. Mohiuddin, a winner of the BOBs award for online activism, was on an Islamist hit list that also included the sociology professor Shafiul Islam. The Islamist fundamentalist group Ansarullah Bangla Team claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Mohiuddin, he later met his attackers in jail, and they told him, \\"You left Islam, you are not a Muslim, you criticized the Quran, we had to do this.\\" Reporters Without Borders stated that Mohiuddin and others have \\"clearly\\" been targeted for their \\"opposition to religious extremism\\".  Ahmed Rajib Haider  On the night of 15 February 2013, Ahmed Rajib Haider, an atheist blogger, was attacked while leaving his house in the Area Palashnagar of Mirpur neighborhood of Dhaka. His body was found lying in a pool of blood, mutilated to the point that his friends could not recognise him. The following day, his coffin was carried through Shahbagh Square in a public protest attended by more than 100,000 people. Haider was an organizer of the Shahbag movement, a group \\"which seeks death for war criminals and a ban on Jamaat-e-Islami and its student front Islami Chhatra Shibir.\\" According to Haider's family, Haider was murdered \\"for the blogs he used to write to bring 'war criminals' to justice\\" and for his outspoken criticism of the Jamaat-e-Islami party. The Shahbag movement described Haider as their \\"first martyr\\".  Sunnyur Rahaman  On the night of 7 March 2013 Sunnyur Rahaman was injured when two men swooped in on him and hacked him with machetes. He came under attack around 9:00 p.m. near the Purabi Cinema Hall in Mirpur, Dhaka. With the assistance of local police, he was rushed to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital with wounds to his head, neck, right leg, and left hand. Rahaman was a Shahbag movement activist and a critic of various religious parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami.  Shafiul Islam  On 15 November 2014 a teacher in the Rajshahi University sociology department named Shafiul Islam, a follower of the Baul community, was struck with sharp weapons by several youths on his way home in Rajshahi city. He died after being taken to Rajshahi Medical College and Hospital. A fundamentalist Islamist militant group named 'Ansar al Islam Bangladesh-2' claimed responsibility for the attack. On a social media website, the group declared: \\"Our Mujahideens [fighters] executed a 'Murtad' [apostate] today in Rajshahi who had prohibited female students in his department to wear 'Burka' [veil].\\" The website also quoted a 2010 article from a newspaper affiliated with Jamaat-e-Islami stating that \\"Professor Shafiul Islam, while being the chair of the sociology department, recruited teachers on condition of being clean-shaved and not wearing kurta-pajamas. He barred female students from wearing burka in classes. This led to many students abandoning burka against their will.\\" According to one of Shafiul Islam's colleagues, the victim was not anti-Islam but had prohibited female students from wearing full-face veils in his classes as he believed they could be used to cheat in exams.  Avijit Roy  Bonya Ahmed speaking about the attack (18:54), and putting it in a broader context. On 26 February 2015 bio- engineer Dr. Avijit Roy, a well-known Bangladeshi blogger, and his wife Bonya Ahmed were attacked in Dhaka by machete-wielding assailants. Roy and his wife had been returning home from the Ekushey Book Fair by bicycle rickshaw when around 8:30 p.m. they were attacked near the Teacher Student Center intersection of Dhaka University by unidentified assailants. According to witnesses, two assailants stopped and dragged them from the rickshaw to the pavement before striking them with machetes. Roy was struck and stabbed in the head with sharp weapons. His wife was slashed on her shoulders and the fingers of her left hand severed when she attempted to go to her husband's aid. Both were rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where Roy died at 10:30 p.m. His wife survived the attack. Roy was a naturalized U.S. citizen and founder of the influential Bangladeshi blog Mukto-Mona (\\"Freethinkers\\"). A champion of liberal secularism and humanism, Roy was an outspoken atheist and opponent of religious extremism. He was the author of ten books, the best known of which was a critique of religious extremism, Virus of Faith. A group calling itself Ansar Bangla7 claimed responsibility for the attack, describing Roy's writings as a \\"crime against Islam\\". They also stated that he was targeted as a U.S. citizen in retaliation for U.S. bombing of ISIS militants in Syria. Roy's killing sparked protests in Dhaka and brought forth expressions of concern internationally. UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice, and for the government to defend freedom of expression and public debate. Author Tahmima Anam wrote in The New York Times: \\"Blogging has become a dangerous profession in Bangladesh\\", stating that writers have rallied at Dhaka University to criticise the authorities for \\"not doing enough to safeguard freedom of expression\\". Anam wrote Mahfuz Anam, editor of The Daily Star, wrote that the death \\"is a spine- chilling warning to us all that we all can be targets. All that needs to happen for any of us to be killed is that some fanatic somewhere in the country, decides that someone or anyone, needs to be killed.\\" Anam stated:  Washiqur Rahman  On 30 March 2015 another blogger, Washiqur Rahman, was killed in the Tejgaon neighborhood of Dhaka in an attack similar to that perpetrated on Avijit Roy. The police arrested two suspects near the scene and recovered meat cleavers from them. The suspects said they killed Raman because of his anti-Islamic articles. Raman was reportedly known for criticizing \\"irrational religious beliefs\\". The suspects informed the police that they are also members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team and had trained for fifteen days before killing the blogger. Imran Sarker told reporters that, unlike Roy, Raman was not a high-profile blogger, but \\"was targeted because open-minded and progressive bloggers are being targeted in general. They are killing those who are easy to access, when they get the opportunity... The main attempt is to create fear among bloggers.\\" According to Sarker, Raman's murder was part of a \\"struggle between those who are promoting political Islam to turn Bangladesh into a fundamentalist, religious state and the secular political forces ... That is why [the bloggers] have become the main target, and the political parties who are supposed to prevent such attacks and provide security to them seem unable to do so. The main problem is that even mainstream political parties prefer to compromise with these radical groups to remain in power\\". The Committee to Protect Journalists issued a press release stating that Raman's death occurred in a climate of \\"official harassment of journalists in Bangladesh\\".  Ananta Bijoy Das  Ananta Bijoy Das, an atheist blogger who was on an extremist hit-list for his writing, was hacked to death by four masked men in Sylhet on 12 May 2015. Ananta wrote blogs for Mukto-Mona. He had authored three books on science, evolution, and revolution in the Soviet Union, and headed the Sylhet-based science and rationalist council. He was also an editor of a quarterly magazine called Jukti (Logic). Ananta Das was invited by the Swedish PEN to discuss the persecution of writers in Bangladesh, but the Swedish government refused him a visa on the grounds that he might not return to Bangladesh after his visit. Lawyer Sara Hossain said of Roy and Das, \\"They've always believed and written very vocally in support of free expression and they've very explicitly written about not following any religion themselves.\\" Asia director of Human Rights Watch Brad Adams said of Ananta's killing, \\"This pattern of vicious attacks on secular and atheist writers not only silences the victims but also sends a chilling message to all in Bangladesh who espouse independent views on religious issues.\\" An editorial in The Guardian stated: \\"Like Raif Badawi, imprisoned and flogged in Saudi Arabia, the brave men who have been murdered are guilty of nothing more than honesty and integrity. Those are virtues that fundamentalists and fanatics cannot stand.\\" The editorial concluded, \\"Violent jihadis have circulated a list with more than 80 names of free thinkers whom they wish to kill. The public murder of awkward intellectuals is one definition of barbarism. Governments of the west, and that of Bangladesh, must do much more to defend freedom and to protect lives.\\"  Niloy Chakroborty  Niloy Chatterjee, also known as Niloy Chakroborty and by his pen name Niloy Neel, was killed on 7 August 2015. It is reported that a gang of about six men armed with machetes attacked him at his home in the Goran neighborhood of Dhaka and hacked him to death. Police said that the men had tricked his wife into allowing them into their home before killing him. His best friend Sahedul Sahed said that Neel had previously reported to the police that he feared for his life, but no action had been taken. He was an organiser of the Science and Rationalist Association Bangladesh, and had obtained a master's degree in Philosophy from Dhaka University in 2013. Niloy had written in Mukto-Mona, a blogging platform for secularists and freethinkers, was associated with the Shahbag Movement; he and his friend Sahedul Sahed had attended the public protest demanding justice for the murdered bloggers, Ananta Bijoy Das and Avijit Roy. Ansarullah Al Islam Bangladesh, an Al Qaeda group, claimed responsibility for Niloy's killing. The UN urged a quick and fair investigation of the murder saying, \\"It is vital to ensure the identification of those responsible for this and the previous horrendous crimes, as well as those who may have masterminded the attacks.\\" Amnesty International condemned the killing and said that it was the \\"urgent duty (of the government) to make clear that no more attacks like this will be tolerated\\". Other entities condemning the killing include the German Government, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Human Rights Watch, the Communist Party of Bangladesh, Gonojagoron Moncho, and other political parties of Bangladesh, both rightist and leftist. Writer Taslima Nasrin criticized the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and her government saying, \\"Sheikh Hasina's government is morally culpable. I am squarely blaming the state for these massacres in installment. Its indifference and so-called inability to rein in the murderous Ansarullah brigade is solely predicated on the fear of being labelled atheists.\\"  Faisal Arefin Dipan  Faisal Arefin Dipan, aged 43, the publisher of Jagriti Prakashani, which published Avijit Roy's Biswasher Virus (Bengali for The Virus of Faith), was hacked to death in Dhaka on 31 October 2015. Reports stated that he had been killed in his third-floor office at the Jagriti Prokashoni publishing house. The attack followed another stabbing, earlier the same day, in which publisher Ahmedur Rashid Chowdhury and two writers, Ranadeep Basu and Tareque Rahim, were stabbed in their office at another publishing house. The three men were taken to hospital, and at least one was reported to be in critical condition. Faisal Arefin Dipan (; 12 July 1972 – 31 October 2015) was a publisher of Bangladesh who had collaborated with many prominent writers of Bengali literature like Muhammed Zafar Iqbal, Syed Shamsul Haque, Ahmed Sofa and Sufia Kamal, as well as eminent scholars and personalities, such as, Bodruddin Umar, Serajul Islam Choudhury, Syed Moqsud Ali, Muhammad Habibur Rahman and Ahmed Sharif, and most notably the secular science writer Avijit Roy. Dipan was brutally hacked to death inside his office at the hands of suspected religious extremists for his association with Avijit Roy and other freethinking, secular and atheist writers. = Early life and education = Dipan was born in an academic family. Both his father Abul Qasem Fazlul Huq, a scholar and a professor of Bengali literature, and mother Farida Pradhan, principal house tutor of Rokeya Hall, retired from Dhaka University. Dipan passed his Secondary School Certificate (1989) and Higher Secondary Certificate (1991) examinations from Udayan Bidyalaya (inside Dhaka University campus area) and Dhaka College respectively. Dipan obtained his BA (Hons) and MA in economics from Dhaka University during mid-late 90s. = Career = Dipan grew up around authors and writers. His father was active in the scholarly circles. Dipan started his publishing house, Jagriti Prokashony (জাগৃতি প্রকাশনী), at a small scale during his undergraduate days in 1992. As stated in a commemorative article in The Daily Star on 22 November 2015, \\"Growing up in a house full of books, Faisal Arefin Dipan had a lifelong fascination for books. He believed that books could rejuvenate a society, a state and a nation.\\" In the first year of its full commercial operations, Jagriti had managed to bring out twelve publications including Nilima Ibrahim's critically acclaimed work, Ami Birangona Bolchhi (আমি বীরাঙ্গনা বলছি) (As a War Heroine, I Speak in English) that tells the stories of Bengali women and girls who were raped and tortured by Pakistani soldiers and their collaborators during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The book documents the horrific experience of survival of these women and girls in Pakistani military camps and takes a critical look at the social structure that they struggled to rejoin after the war was over. In the twenty-three years of operation of Jagriti, Dipan had published around sixteen hundred books and collaborated with many famous and upcoming writers of Bangladesh like Sufia Kamal, Nirmalindu Goon, Rudra Mohammad Shahidullah, Badruddin Umar, Selina Hossain, Selim Al Deen and Muhammed Zafar Iqbal to name a few. = Jagriti Prokashony = Besides working with the prominent authorities and scholars of Bengali literature, Jagriti created a platform for many new and promising poets and writers. The genres of Jagriti publications cover a wide spectrum, such as, children's books, humour, fantasy, biography, science, history, science fiction, novels, poetry and scholarly essays. In one of his television interviews in 2012, Dipan had expressed his aim to stand apart from many others by supporting both \\"creative entertainment\\" and \\"enrichment of mind\\" streams of works. He felt that the latter category was becoming subdued in the recent days and more needed to be done to revive the intellectual stream in Bangladeshi publications. Jagriti's most notable publications include:     Dipan was an active member in the publishers’ associations in Bangladesh and had held several positions in the executive committees. He was actively involved in the annual Ekushey Book Fair (একুশে বই মেলা) and other Bengali book fairs. Dipan had appeared in newspaper and television interviews, and talk shows to discuss publication industry in Bangladesh. Despite the tragic death of Dipan, Jagriti Prokashony remains fully operational today under the management of DIpan's spouse Razia Rahman Jolly (a Senior Medical Officer at the Dhaka University Medical Centre). = Association with Avijit Roy = Avijit Roy, the slain Bangladeshi-American online activist, writer and blogger, was known to Dipan from his early childhood in the Dhaka University campus area where they lived in the same neighbourhood and attended Udayan Bidyalaya. Avijit had two of his significant works, Philosophy of Disbelief (অবিশ্বাসের দর্শন) and Virus of Faith (বিশ্বাসের ভাইরাস: বিশ্বাসের বিবর্তনীয় বিশ্লেষণ), published from Jagriti Prokashony. Dipan had received several death threats for his association with Avijit Roy since the rise of religious extremism in Bangladesh in recent years. = Murder = Dipan was brutally hacked to death by a group of suspected religious fundamentalists in the afternoon of 31 October 2015, while he was working alone inside his office at Aziz Supermarket in Dhaka. His body was found in a pool of blood by the local market authorities and his father, who had to break into Jagriti Prokashony office left locked from inside by the murders, and had several injury marks of sharp weapons like machetes. Dipan was pronounced dead as soon as his body was rushed to the nearby hospital. Dipan's murder coincided with the attack on another publisher of Avijit Roy, Ahmedur Rashid Tutul (proprietor of Shuddhoswar Prokashony), who survived a similar brutal hacking inside his office in a different part of Dhaka in the same afternoon. Some local sleeper cells of international terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State have claimed responsibilities of the attacks on secular writers, free thinkers and human rights activists in Bangladesh. The law enforcement authorities of Bangladesh have been in active pursuit of the perpetrators with some success since their anti-terror drive has intensified following the Holy Artisan terror attacks in Gulshan. Dipan's death was widely covered in global and local media, had sparked outrage among general public and received strong condemnation from many organisations including the UN and the US Embassy in Dhaka. = First death anniversary = Dipan Smriti Sangsad (Dipan Memorial Council) held a memorial event at the Teacher-Student Centre auditorium of Dhaka University on 31 October 2016 to mark the first anniversary of Dipan's death. Eminent academics, writers, publishers, journalists, cultural personalities and activists like Anisuzzaman, Abdullah Abu Sayeed, Abul Kashem Fazlul Haque, Ajoy Roy, Abul Barkat, AAMS Arefin Siddique, Ashraf Uddin Chowdhury, Mamunur Rashid, Shyamoli Nasrin Chowdhury, Imran H Sarker, Golam Mortaja and Khan Mahbub participated in the discussion. A book to commemorate Dipan's life and work was launched at the event. The speakers, while addressing almost a five hundred strong audience from all walks of life, expressed deep concern and dissatisfaction at the slow progress of the murder investigation. They highlighted the prevalence of \\"a culture of impunity and lack of accountability\\" in Bangladesh that was leading to the recurrence of heinous crimes like the brutal hacking of Dipan and others. The day was also marked by a large human chain of mourners and protesters, near Aziz Super Market in Dhaka, demanding immediate arrest and speedy trial of Dipan's killers. All major television channels in Bangladesh provided special coverage of the event in their national news segments. A more private memorial event was organised at the Gulshan residence of late Syed Moqsud Ali (an eminent scholar and professor of Dhaka University who had his work published from Jagriti) where a large number of Dipan's oldest friends held discussion on Dipan and offered prayers for his departed soul. Ahmedur Rashid Chowdhury (Tutul) Ahmedur Rashid Chowdhury Tutul, aged 43, editor and publisher of Shuddhashar In February 2015, he received a death threat, for publishing books of atheist writers and his secular view. On 31 October 2015, he was attacked by assailants with machetes. He was hospitalized in a critical condition. Ansar Al Islam (AQIS Bangladesh) claimed the responsibility. Shahjahan Bachchu Shahjahan Bachchu an acting editor of weekly Amader Bikrampur and former general secretary of Munshiganj chapter of Communist Party of Bangladesh shot dead on 11 June 2018. His daughter said to the Daily Star that when bloggers were being killed one after another in Bangladesh, her father received threats on his mobile phones on a number of occasions. He had his own publishing house “Bishaka Prokashoni”. Main suspect of that murder named Abdur Rahman arrested on 24 June and according to the police press he got killed by gunfight on 28 June 2018.  Broader attacks  After an initial wave of attacks focused solely on secularists, most of them atheists, the targets broadened to include other activists, members of religious minority groups, and representatives of Bengali or western culture. Some of these attacks are reported to have been regretted by the murderers associated with one of the perpetrating groups, Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh. They admitted that they had bungled their research, choosing victims who had not offended Islam but were simply popular figures in the community. Kunio Hoshi was a 66-year-old Japanese man from Iwate Prefecture who was shot in Rangpur, Bangladesh, in October 2015. Hoshi was also known by the aliases Hita Kuchi and Golam Kibria. Hoshi first went to Bangladesh in 2011 and had visited every year since. He last arrived in June 2015, approximately four months before his death. Hoshi was shot three times in a remote rural region of Rangpur, where he had invested in a grass cultivation project and had leased land for Tk82,000. According to police sources, Hoshi was not a wealthy man and had come to Bangladesh to improve his condition, adding that the relatively low cost of living in Bangladesh and its rich soil drove him to try his luck in Bangladesh. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIL claimed responsibility for killing Hoshi on Twitter, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, a US monitoring organization. His murderers told investigators that they had bungled their research and did not realize that Kunio had converted to Islam. The Japanese Embassy of Bangladesh argued that Hoshi should be buried in Bangladesh, with an Islamic-style ceremony. He was ultimately buried in Bangladesh.  Jogeshwar Roy  On 21 February 2016 the so-called Islamic State group has said it was behind the beheading of Jogeshwar Roy, a senior Hindu priest, and the wounding of two worshippers in the Panchagarh district of northern Bangladesh.  Rezaul Karim Siddique  On 23 April 2016 A. F. M. Rezaul Karim Siddique, a professor of English at the University of Rajshahi, was hacked to death by several unidentified assailants while waiting for a bus to the university campus in Rajshahi city. ISIL later claimed responsibility for his death.  Xulhaz Mannan and Mahbub Rabbi Tonoy  Two days after Siddique's murder (25 April 2016), gay-rights activists Xulhaz Mannan and Mahbub Rabbi Tonoy were hacked to death by assailants who broke into Mannan's apartment in the Kalabagan neighborhood of Dhaka. Mannan was the editor of Bangladesh's first LGBT-themed magazine Roopbaan and an employee of USAID, Bangladesh. Tonoy was a prominent theater activist and co- organizer of the Rainbow Rally 2015. ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack.  Nikhil Joarder  On 30 April 2016 Nikhil Joarder, a Hindu tailor, was hacked to death by two assailants in Tangail in central Bangladesh, by several men on a motorcycle. Responsibility for the crime was quickly claimed by the organization Islamic State through the news agency of the terrorist group.  Mohammad Shahidullah  On 7 May 2016 suspected Islamic militants hacked to death a 65-year-old minority Sufi Muslim man, Mohammad Shahidullah, at a mango grove in Mymensingh.  Maung Shue U Chak  Maung Shue U Chak, a 75-year-old Buddhist monk, was hacked to death in the Bandarban district of southeastern Bangladesh on 14 May 2016. The Islamic State is suspected to be behind the killing.,  Mir Sanaur Rahman and Saifuzzaman  Machete-wielding assailants hacked a village doctor to death and wounded a university teacher in the Kushtia district of Bangladesh on 20 May 2016. The homeopathic doctor, Mir Sanaur Rahman, 55, was killed on the spot, and his companion, identified as Saifuzzaman, 45, suffered serious wounds. Police found a bloody machete at the scene. Mir Sanaur Rahman provided free treatment to villagers, and his murderers, who belonged to Jamaat-ul- Mujahideen Bangladesh, are said to have chosen him as a target because they bungled their research when seeking possible victims.  Debesh Chandra Pramanik  On 25 May 2016 Debesh Chandra Pramanik, a 68-year-old Hindu businessman, was attacked and killed in his shoe shop at Gaibandha in Dhaka district. ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack, their second in Bangladesh in less than a week.  Ananda Gopal Ganguly  On 7 June 2016, Ananda Gopal Ganguly, a 70-year-old Hindu priest, had his throat slit by suspected Islamists in the Jhenaidaha district of the Khulna division, soon after three suspected Islamists were killed by police. He was said to have been hacked and shot at, with a cut to the throat being the death blow. Three men attacked him while he was riding on his motorcycle.  Nityaranjan Pande  On 10 June 2016 Nityaranjan Pande, a 60-year-old worker at a Hindu monastery in Pabna, was hacked to death by several people near the monastery. Islamist militants have been suspected in his death. Ripon Chakraborty On 15 June 2016 Ripon Chakraborty, a Hindu college teacher in the Madaripur district was attacked with machete knives at his home by three people. He survived the attack, but was seriously injured. One of the three attackers named Ghulam Faijullaha Fahim was caught while escaping and handed over to police by local people.  Shyamananda Das  On 1 July 2016 Shyamananda Das, a Hindu temple worker, was hacked to death by three suspected Islamic militants on motorcycles in the Satkhira district. Another two Hindu men, Surendra Sarkar and Tarak Saha, were reportedly injured by suspected Islamic militants in the attack although this has not been confirmed.  Mong Shwe Lung Marma  On 2 July 2016 Mong Shwe Lung Marma, a Buddhist farmer and the vice president of ward seven of the Awami league, was hacked to death and assassinated in Bandarban. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assassination. The victim was killed near the site of a previous killing of another Buddhist. Gulshan attack On 1 July 2016 at around 11:30 pm local time, six militants entered and opened fire on the Holey Artisan Bakery in Gulshan, a diplomatic neighborhood of Dhaka. They also threw bombs and took several dozen hostages. A total of 28 people were killed, including 17 foreigners, two police officers, and five gunmen. One of the gunmen was captured and 13 hostages were freed by the Bangladesh Armed Forces, police, RAB, BGB, and joint forces. According to Bangladesh's Inspector General of Police, all six of the attackers were Bangladeshi citizens. Disputed attacks  Nazimuddin Samad  Nazimuddin Samad (1988 – 6 April 2016) was a law student at Jagannath University and liberal blogger who was reportedly killed by suspected radical Islamists in Dhaka for his promotion of secularism in Bangladesh. Unidentified assailants attacked Samad with a machete and shot him to death. However, Imran H Sarker, convener of the Gonojagaran Mancha said that the murder had been committed by government collusion in order divert attention from the rape and killing of Sohagi Jahan Tonu, a student of Comilla University.  Mahmuda Khanam Mitu  On 5 June 2016 Mahmuda Khanam Mitu, the wife of a Bangladesh police superintendent Babul Aktar, was stabbed, shot in the head, and killed by three suspected outside of her apartment at a busy road junction in Chittagong. Her six-year-old son was present with her while she was killed. Although she was not secular or atheist, but religious, initially the killing was suspected to have been done by Islamic extremists, as her husband had headed several investigations and operation raids related to the strings of killings committed by Islamic extremists in Chittagong and was awarded. The killings were however condemned by Ansar al-Islam, the suspected Bangladesh chapter of al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent. However, in 2017 Mitu's father, Md Mosharraf Hossain said that circumstantial evidence led him to believe that Babul himself had orchestrated his wife's murder. This allegations arose Babul was alleged to have an extramarital affair Bonani Binte Bonni, wife of deceased Special Branch Sub-Inspector Akram Hossain Liton. Babul hade been previously interrogated by police on several occasions. As of February 2017, police were investigating listed criminal Kamrul Islam Musa, a former informant who had served under Babul Aktar and his accomplice Nabi.  Earlier attacks   Taslima Nasrin  In the 1990s author Taslima Nasrin achieved notoriety in Bangladesh for \\"her bold use of sexual imagery in her poetry, her self-declared atheism, and her iconoclastic lifestyle\\". In her newspaper columns and books, she criticized rising religious fundamentalism and government inaction. In early 1992 mobs began attacking book stores stocking her work. The same year she was assaulted at a book fair and her passport was confiscated. In July 1993 her novel Lajja was banned by the government for allegedly creating \\"misunderstanding among communities\\". On 23 September 1993 a fatwa was issued for her death. After international pressure, her passport was returned in April 1994, after which she traveled to France and returned via India. On 4 July 1994, an arrest warrant was issued for her under an old statute dating to the British colonial period outlawing writings \\"intended to outrage ... religious believers\\", and she went underground. After being granted bail on 3 August, Nasrin fled to Sweden, remaining in exile for some years. In 1998 she visited her critically ill mother in Bangladesh but was forced to go into hiding once again after threats and demonstrations. In 2005 she moved to India and applied for citizenship.  Shamsur Rahman  On 18 January 1999 Shamsur Rahman, a leading Bangladeshi poet, was targeted, and a failed attempt was made by Harakat-Ul-Jihad-Ul-Islami to kill him at his residence for his writings.  Humayun Azad  In 2003 Bangladeshi secular author and critic Humayun Azad wrote a book named Pak Sar Jamin Saad Baad criticising the political party, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. Azad received numerous death threats from fundamentalist groups after its publication. On 27 February 2004, he became the victim of an assassination attempt by assailants armed with machetes near the campus of the University of Dhaka during the annual Ekushey Book Fair. A week prior to that assault, Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, a Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader and then member of the parliament, demanded in the parliament that Azad's political satire Pak Sar Jamin Saad Baad be banned and called for the application of the Blasphemy Act to the author. On 12 August 2004 Azad was found dead in his apartment in Munich, Germany, where he had arrived a week earlier to conduct research on the 19th-German romantic poet Heinrich Heine. His family demanded an investigation, alleging that the extremists who had attempted the earlier assassination had a role in this death.  Suspects and arrests  On 26 April 2006 a Majlish-e-Shura member of Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh named Salahuddin was arrested by RAB from Chittagong as a suspected attacker on Humayun Azad. Salahuddin, accused in 33 cases, was given the death penalty for another murder case. On 2 March 2013 the Bangladesh Detective Bureau arrested five members of the extremist organisation Ansarullah Bangla Team for the murder of Ahmed Rajib Haider. The five, all students of North South University, confessed to the crime in front of a magistrate. On 2 March 2015 the RAB arrested Farabi Shafiur Rahman, a radical Islamist, as a suspected murderer of Avijit Roy. It was suspected by the police that Farabi had provided Roy's location, identity, and family photographs to various people. Farabi had threatened Roy several times through blogs and social media sites including Facebook. He said on different posts and comments that Roy would be killed upon his arrival in Dhaka. On 14 August 2015 Bangladesh police said that they had arrested two men, suspected to be members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team, in connection with the murder of Niloy Neel. On 18 August 2015 three members of Ansarullah Bangla Team, including a British citizen named Touhidur Rahman who police described as \\"the main planner of the attacks on Avijit Roy and Ananta Bijoy Das\\", had been arrested in connection with the two murders.  Death sentences in the Ahmed Rajib Haider case  Ahmed Rajib Haider's murder case was handled by a \\"fast-track trial court\\". On 30 December 2015, just under three years later, two members of Ansarullah Bangla TeamMd Faisal Bin Nayem and Redwanul Azad Ranawere found guilty of murder and sentenced to death for Rajib Haider's murder. Faisal, the court said, was the one who attacked Haider with a meat cleaver. Rana absconded and was sentenced in absentia. Another member of the outlawed group, Maksudul Hasan, was also guilty of murder and given a life sentence. Five other members of ABT, including firebrand leader Mufti Jasim Uddin Rahmani, received jail terms of five to ten years. One person was given a term of three years.

It is approximately long and flows through Scott Township, South Abington Township, and Scranton. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek has three named tributaries: Leach Creek, Clover Hill Creek, and Summit Lake Creek. Leggetts Creek is considered to be impaired due to urban development problems, but is not affected by acid mine drainage. The creek is fairly alkaline and is a perennial stream. Its headwaters are in wetlands outside of the Lackawanna Valley and it flows through a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. Major lakes in the watershed include the Griffin Reservoir (which is used as a water supply), Summit Lake, and Maple Lake. The creek is a source of flooding in South Abington Township. A historic Native American path used to pass through the water gap of Leggetts Creek on its way from the headwaters of the Lehigh River to the Great Bend on the Susquehanna River near the Pennsylvania/New York border. Some mining and quarrying operations have been done in the watershed and the Liggett's Gap Railroad was built and was opened, through what was called Liggett's Gap at the time, on April 15, 1851The Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad in the 19th Century, Thomas T. Taber III, 1977, Lycoming Printing Company, Williamsport, PA.. In the late 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries, numerous bridges were constructed across the creek. Wild trout naturally reproduce within the creek and several other species have been observed in its waters as well. Some reaches of the creek have a riparian buffer consisting of old growth forests. In other places, there are grasslands or invasive plants. A greenway/connecting trail along the creek was proposed in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan. Course Leggetts Creek upstream of its mouth Leggetts Creek begins in a wetland in Scott Township. It flows southwest for several tenths of a mile before turning south and flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 347. After more than a mile, the creek passes near the community of Justus in Scott Township and turns west. After several tenths of a mile, it passes the Griffin Reservoir and enters South Abington Township. From the southwestern end of the reservoir, the creek flows southwest for more than a mile before turning south-southwest and crossing Interstate 81. After some distance, the creek receives Summit Lake Creek, its first named tributary, from the right and turns southeast. For the next few miles, the creek flows alongside US Route 6 and Interstate 81 through a water gap between West Mountain and Bell Mountain. In the water gap, the creek eventually turns south for some distance and enters Scranton before turning south-southeast, leaving the water gap and receiving the tributary Clover Hill Creek from the left. It then turns south- southwest for several tenths of a mile before receiving Leach Creek, its last named tributary, from the right. The creek then turns east for several tenths of a mile before turning north for several hundred feet and then turning east again. After several hundred feet, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Leggetts Creek reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Leggetts Creek has three named direct tributaries: Leach Creek, Clover Hill Creek, and Summit Lake Creek. Leach Creek joins Leggetts Creek upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . Summit Lake Creek joins Leggetts Creek upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . Leggetts Creek also has a number of first-order tributaries that are locally named, but not officially named. Hydrology Leggetts Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired due to urban development problems. It is possible that Leggetts Creek sometimes exceeds its total maximum daily load, especially during low flow conditions and the summer months. There are some mine drainage issues on the creek between Rockwell Avenue and Charles Street. It experiences some flow loss to underground mine voids. In 1978, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) estimated that the creek lost 20 to 30 percent of its flow to mines during dry weather. However, the creek is large enough that this does not cause aquatic habitat to be lost. The Chinchilla sewage treatment plant discharges into the creek in the vicinity of Leggetts Gap. In its lower reaches, the creek is impacted by past mining, urban development, and debris. Stormwater also flows into the Lackawanna River via the creek and it is affected by fine sediment. There is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed, at Leggett's Creek Estates. South Abington Township once applied for a permit to discharge stormwater associated with construction activities into Leggetts Creek and for a permit for \\"Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems\\" into the creek. Leggetts Creek attains its designated uses. However, its water quality and habitat quality are significantly impacted and it contributes significantly to the degradation of the Lackawanna River. The degradation is mainly due to urbanization, as opposed to abandoned mine drainage. The creek is a perennial stream. In a 2009 study, the creek was described as showing \\"some degraded conditions\\". Leggetts Creek has relatively high levels of total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the creek ranged from 538.00 to 979.50 micro-siemens per centimeter, with an average of 677.54 micro-siemens per centimeter. The concentration of dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 680.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 411.96 milligrams per liter. The creek is fairly alkaline, with a pH ranging from 7.64 to 9.23 and averaging 8.20. The concentration of salinity in the creek averages 345 parts per million, but reaches levels as high as 435 parts per million and as low as 280 parts per million. This is within the recommended limit of 1000 parts per million, but a 2013/2014 study nevertheless recommended reducing the salinity of the creek. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in Leggetts Creek ranges from 28.95% to 236.75%, with an average of 119.27%. The concentration of nitrates in the creek was once found to be 2.50 milligrams per liter and the concentration of phosphates was once found to be 1.58 milligrams per liter. However, in 2001, the concentration of nutrients and sodium in the creek was found to be the highest of tested sites in the area. The concentration of nitrates was 6.3 milligrams per liter and the concentration of nitrogen was 6.87 milligrams per liter. The concentration of orthophosphate was 1.998 milligrams per liter and the total phosphorus concentration was 2.228 milligrams per liter. The sodium concentration was 84.3 milligrams per liter. Little or no overall impairment was observed in 2008. The peak annual discharge of Leggetts Creek near its mouth has a 10 percent chance of reaching 2180 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 4440 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 5790 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 10,800 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge of the creek upstream of the tributary Leach Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 2130 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 4340 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 5620 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 10,600 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge of Leggetts Creek at Neary Place (Mary Street) has a 10 percent chance of reaching 2470 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 5070 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 6760 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 12,600 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge of the creek at the border between Scranton and South Abington Township has a 10 percent chance of reaching 2130 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 4340 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 5320 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 9030 cubic feet per second. Geography, geology, and climate Leggetts Creek upstream of its mouth The elevation near the mouth of Leggetts Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. During a 2013 fish population survey, the average stream width of the creek was found to be approximately . Leggetts Creek flows through a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. The gap is cut through the West or Lackawanna Mountain Range by the creek. There have been some culm banks along the creek and historic mining operations such as those at the Marvine #6 Colliery have affected it. The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is riprap on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this stretch. It typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches and there are some reaches with gradual slopes. However, in some parts of the creek's lower reaches, fill has been dumped onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been channelized in South Abington Township. There are waterfalls and cascades on a reach of Leggetts Creek from the Griffin Reservoir to an intake dam three quarters of a mile downstream. These waterfalls are formed by rock ledges, boulders, and the remains of an old mill. A streambank stabilization project has been carried out on the creek at South Abington Park. The creek flows through 51 pipes, whose sizes range from . The Keyser Avenue Borehole is in the vicinity of the creek. The headwaters of Leggetts Creek are outside of the Lackawanna Valley. At Providence, the creek flowed directly southeast prior to the glacial period, reaching the Lackawanna River approximately downstream of its current location. However, the course now flows to the east instead. The old course of the creek has been built over. There is a ledge on the north bank of Leggetts Creek in its lower reaches. The creek makes a sharp eastward bend around Providence. From this point downstream to its mouth, it flows through a rocky channel that contains a thick covering of till on its upper walls. A run of the river dam known as the High Service Dam is on Leggetts Creek in Scranton. The dam is wide. A rock formation known as the Campbell's Ledge Black Shale occurs in the vicinity of Leggetts Creek. This rock formation contains shale and coal. The ledge on the northern bank of the creek was in the early 1900s noted to contain a large mass (up to a million tons) of sandy till. In early March 2013, the temperature in the vicinity of Leggetts Creek was once measured to be . A 2013/2014 study found the water temperature of the creek to range from , with an average of . Watershed The watershed of Leggetts Creek has an area of . Upstream of the tributary Leach Creek, the watershed has an area of . It is one of the larger tributaries of the Lackawanna River. The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Scranton. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Dalton. The creek is a third-order stream and is the third- largest tributary of the Lackawanna River, not counting the East Branch Lackawanna River and the West Branch Lackawanna River. Municipalities that the watershed is in include Scott Township, South Abington Township, Abington Township, Clarks Green, Clarks Summit, Newton Township, Dickson City, and Scranton. Major land uses in the watershed of Leggetts Creek include high- density residential, neighborhood commercial, and open space. Lakes in the watershed of Leggetts Creek include the Griffin Reservoir, Maple Lake, and Summit Lake. These bodies of water are in South Abington Township and Scott Township. The Griffin Reservoir supplies water to people in the Leggetts Creek watershed. The creek and the reservoir serve as a supplemental drinking water supply for more than 100,000 people as of the late 20th century. A spring known as Fountain Springs is in the watershed in South Abington Township. The Justus Meadows are in the watershed in Scott Township. Most of the watershed is developed, but there are still a few undeveloped reaches of the creek. As of the early 2000s, the Theta Company owns some tracts of land in the watershed of Leggetts Creek. These include areas around the Griffin Reservoir and Maple Lake. Some property along the creek's floodplain is owned by the city of Scranton. Additionally, there are parcels of abandoned mine lands in the vicinity of the creek in northern Scranton. These parcels may be developed by the 2020s. The major neighborhoods in the watershed include historic residential neighborhoods that were developed between 1870 and 1920. Leggetts Creek is a source of flooding in South Abington Township, where it commonly floods low-lying properties. History and etymology Leggetts Creek flowing under a bridge upstream of its mouth Leggetts Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 30, 1990. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199030. The creek is also known as Legget Creek, Leggett's Gap Creek, and Leggits Creek. The creek is named after James Leggett, a pioneer who settled there in the 1770s. A historic Native American path used to pass through the water gap of Leggetts Creek on its way from the headwaters of the Lehigh River to the Great Bend in the Susquehanna River near the Pennsylvania/New York border. Thomas Meredith conceived the idea of a railroad going from the mouth of the creek at Providence to the Great Bend on the Susquehanna River, a distance of , in 1826. Names such as the \\"Lackawannock and Susquehanna Railroad\\" and the \\"Meredith Railroad\\" were considered, but eventually the name \\"Leggetts Gap Railroad\\" was settled on. The railroad was first chartered in 1832, but no progress was made until 1849. The Rockwell Mine at Leggetts Gap was opened in 1854. The Leggetts Creek Colliery was operational in the early 1900s. Additionally, a ledge in the vicinity of the creek was quarried extensively by the early 1900s. Numerous bridges have been built across Leggetts Creek. A masonry arch bridge with a length of carries North Main Street over the creek. A 36.1-foot-long concrete tee beam bridge was built in 1905 and carries Rockwell Avenue across the creek. A 38.1-foot-long concrete tee beam bridge was built in 1936 and carries US Route 11 across the creek. In 1941, a 26.9-foot-long concrete culvert bridge that carries State Route 6006 was constructed over the creek. In 1961, a 32.2-foot-long two-span steel culvert bridge that carries an Interstate 81 ramp was constructed over the creek. A 23.0-foot-long concrete culvert bridge was built in the same year and carries Interstate 81 over the creek. In 1975, a 48.9-foot-long concrete tee beam bridge was built; this bridge carries Hollow Ave over Leggetts Creek. In 1979, a 37.1-foot-long prestressed box beam or girders bridge was built; it carries Mary Street across the creek. A 44.9-foot-long bridge of the same type was built in the same year and carries Wells Street over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long bridge of a similar type was built in 2009 and carries T-422/Burcher Ave over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge was built in 2010 and carries State Route 1027/Layton Road over the creek. In the late 1960s, a dredging project was proposed on Leggetts Creek to repair the damage caused by acid mine drainage and coal mining. In 1991, the Lackawanna River Corridor Association gathered data on the water chemistry and biological habitats of Leggetts Creek. In 2012, the South Abington Sewer Authority began upgrading its sewage treatment plant to prevent wastewater and nutrient pollution from entering the creek. They also installed new sewer lines, including some that run parallel to or under the creek. PA Trout Unlimited's AMD Technical Assistance Program conducted a survey of the fish population in the creek on November 15, 2013. The Lackawanna Valley Conservancy once received a $190,000 Growing Greener grant for the Leggetts Creek Greenway. Historic places in the watershed of Leggetts Creek include Griffins Mills, which are in South Abington. The Aladdin Plating site, which is in the watershed of Leggetts Creek in South Abington, is a Superfund site. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that Scranton, South Abington Township, and Scott Township include protection of Leggetts Creek in their zoning plans. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in Leggetts Creek from Summit Lake Creek downstream to its mouth, a distance of . It is stocked with trout and also is inhabited by some non-game species. The drainage basin of the creek upstream of Summit Lake Creek is a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From Summit Lake Creek downstream to its mouth, the drainage basin is a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In a 2013 fishery survey of the creek, nine brown trout were observed. Their lengths ranged from 84 to 316 millimeters, with an average of 139 millimeters. The vast majority were in the 75 to 99 millimeter bracket. Their population density was 164 per hectare. In the fishery survey of Leggetts Creek, brown trout and cutlips minnow were the only common species. However, bluegill, eastern blacknose dace, longnose dace, and largemouth bass were all classified as \\"present\\" in the creek. Brown bullhead, flatnose minnow, and pumpkinseed were found to be rare. The plant life around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek includes various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's riparian buffer contains old growth forest, including tulip poplar trees. In addition to tulip popular, hemlock and pine also occur in the Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some riparian buffering. Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas are full of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include Japanese knotweed, Norway Maple, and Ailanthus. Overall, the riparian buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land. At three sites on Leggetts Creek, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) Taxa Richness ranges from 4.00 to 6.00. The Total Taxa Richness ranges from 10.00 to 11.00. The Taxa Richness and the EPT Taxa Richness are the total number of macroinvertebrate taxa observed in a sample and the total number of those taxa that are in the three aforementioned orders, respectively. The Percent Intolerance Index ranges from 4.2% to 7.9% and the Beck's Index value ranges from 2.00 to 6.00. These two methods count individuals with PTVs of 0 to 3 and taxa with PTVs of 0 to 2, respectively. The Shannon Diversity Index value ranges from 0.70 to 2.01 and the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value ranges from 1.24 to 2.85. The former is a method of determining community composition by considering both taxonomic richness and evenness of individuals. The latter is a count of individuals, weighted by pollution tolerance. The IBI Score of the creek ranges from 31.45 at site A2 to 43.39 at site D1. The habitat assessment result of the creek was an \\"optimal\\" 192 out of 200 on the reaches where it was analyzed. Recreation A greenway and/or connecting trail along Leggetts Creek was proposed in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan in the early 2000s. The greenway would be known as the Leggetts Creek greenway. It could link to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail and could be extended to link to the Tunkhannock greenway.

Oregon and Alaska both voted in legalization on Election Day 2014, but Alaska preceded Oregon in enacting their legislation. The legal status of cannabis in Alaska had varied greatly over the preceding 40 years. Alaska had previously recognized a right to cannabis with the 1975 Ravin v.

Flag poles and entrance sign to Cedar Bayou plant off Interstate 10 in Baytown, Texas.  History   Gulf Oil  When Gulf Oil decided to build a new chemicals plant in 1962, the company made the announcement at a Baytown Chamber of Commerce luncheon. Some 230 people attended a lunch on March 13, 1962 to hear Gulf Oil vice president Dr. Alexander Lewis Jr. discuss his company's plans for the 1,000 acres of prairieland just east of the town's center. Attendees of the lunch paid $2.50. Baytown Mayor Al Clayton attended the historic Chamber lunch alongside County Commissioner V.V. Ramsey, County Judge Bill Elliott, Houston Chamber of Commerce executive vice president Marvin Hurley, and congratulatory telegrams were sent by Texas Governor Price Daniel and Texas Senators John Tower and Ralph Yarborough. Gulf Oil's new project was being represented as the initial development of what someday is expected to be a vast complex of interrelated industrial facilities. Named the Cedar Bayou plant, Gulf Oil would build one ethylene unit and preserve about 15 additional acres for future expansion. The geographic location of Cedar Bayou plant was favorable in relation to raw material supplies from the growing pipeline grid in Texas and the nearby underground storage facilities, or salt domes, in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Approximately 65 people were employed at the plant. Gulf Oil announces expansion projects for Cedar Bayou plant in 1975. In 1975, Gulf Oil announced two expansion projects at Cedar Bayou plant. A new ethylene unit was to be built and replace the original ethylene unit that opened the plant in 1963. This ethylene unit is still in operation today. In addition, a low-density polyethylene plant was also constructed on the plant's vacant west end. By 1976, the Cedar Bayou plant's employee base had increased to 350 workers – 250 of which were Gulf Oil employees and 100 were nested contractors. During the expansion projects, construction workers peaked at 2,500. On Sept. 28, 1982, the Cedar Bayou plant received a letter from an anonymous person that ten bombs had been hidden within the plant. The sender of the letter threatened to detonate the bombs unless Gulf Oil paid $15 million. Gulf Oil shut down the Cedar Bayou plant after determining the letter was a legitimate threat. A search of the Cedar Bayou plant located five sophisticated bombs in metal casings. A federal and multi-state investigation led to the arrest of four people—John Marvin McBride; his common-law wife, Jill Renee Bird; Michael Allen Worth, and Theodore D. McKinney, all of Durango, Colorado. Charges against Jill Renee Bird were dropped in exchange for her husband's cooperation. https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/01/us/bomb- explodes-at-gulf-plant-in-texas.html http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1982/10/01/page/9/article/1-of-5-bombs- explodes-at-petrochemical-plant https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/08/us/around- the-nation-bond-is-set-at-1-million-in-refinery-bombing.html  Chevron Corporation  The era of Gulf Oil ended for the Cedar Bayou plant in 1984. During this time, Gulf Oil was negotiating what newspapers called the “largest business takeover in U.S. history” when Standard Oil Co. of California, also known as Socal, purchased the struggling Gulf Oil for $13.3 billion.http://www.chevron.com/about/history/1980/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2008/10/18/AR2008101801794.html When the deal was complete, Socal transferred its newly-acquired Texas Gulf Coast plants to Chevron Corporation, which at the time was owned by Socal. By acquiring Gulf Oil, Socal nearly doubled its worldwide proved oil and gas reserves overnight. In September 1985, Chevron Corporation announced an expansion of the plant's existing alpha olefins unit.http://www.joc.com/chevron-add-propylene- capacity_19880809.html On October 12, 1990, a fire was reported at the Cedar Bayou plant.

In just over two days, 30 inches of rain fell on the bayou's watershed and the Cedar Bayou was flooded. When the rain runoff began spilling into the plant's electrical substation, the facility lost all outside electrical power forcing operators to shut down most process units. Employees watched temporary barriers fail and control rooms, warehouses, and offices become submerged. In a Baytown Sun newspaper interview shortly after, then-plant Manager Larry Lucchesi said it was the worst disaster to strike the plant in its 32 years.http://www.icis.com/resources/news/1994/10/31/27968/floods-put-cedar- bayou-out-for-one-month-plus/  Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.

It currently houses a seminary, the Wyższe Seminarium Duchowne Towarzystwa Salezjańskiego, run by the Salesian order. On 1 July 2009, Ląd Abbey was designated an official Polish Historic Monument.http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU20091040861  History   Cistercians  According to tradition, the Cistercian monastery of Ląd was founded around 1145 and was one of the seven daughter houses of Altenberg Abbey near Cologne. Monks continued to be recruited from the Rhineland into the sixteenth century. Around 1300, the monastery possessed 30 villages. In 1331 the monastery was sacked by the Teutonic Knights, perhaps in retaliation for the abbey's support of Poland in the conflict between them and the Order. The monastery grew through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and by 1500 possessed 52 villages and 3 towns, including Zagórów. In 1511 a ruling in the Sejm allowed Polish monks to enter the abbey. By 1538, the rules required the abbot to come from a Polish noble family. After the election of the Polish monk Jan Wysocki to the abbacy, the German Cistercians left the abbey for Henryków Abbey in Silesia. In 1651, Abbot Jan Zapolski initiated a Baroque rebuilding of the church, which is the structure that remains to this day. The abbey flourished in 1697–1750 under the abbacy of Antoni Mikołaj Łukomski, a philosopher and patron of art and learning. However, the abbey began to decline at the turn of the eighteenth century. Many possessions were sold off, and in 1796, the abbey saw most of its land holdings confiscated for an annual cash payment by the government of the Prussian partition. Shifting borders saw Ląd come under the Russian partition, which dissolved the monastery in 1819. The last monks remained at the abbey until 1848.  Capuchins  In 1822 the monastery was acquired by Count Wacław Gutakowski, who arranged for the abbey to pass to Capuchins from Warsaw and for the restoration and furnishing of both the church and cloister. The Capuchin cloister was closed by the Tsar in 1864 as part of the retribution after the January Uprising.  Salesians  Since 1921 Ląd Abbey has been operated and maintained by the Salesian order and houses a seminary of that order. During the occupation of Poland in World War II, the Salesians were forced to evacuate the cloister and the church was shuttered. From 1939-1941, the abbey was used as a transitional prison for priests, primarily from the Diocese of Włocławek. After the prison was closed, the cloister served for a time as a camp for the Hitlerjugend. The Salesians returned after the war and reopened the seminary. In 1952, the Communist government forced the closing of the lower seminary, and Ląd became the home of a high seminary, the Wyższego Seminarium Duchownego Towarzystwa Salezjańskiego. In 1972, a major program of renovation and reconstruction was begun. In 2009, the former Cistercian monastery was added to the List of Historical Monuments in Poland.

The aircraft servicing the flight, a Tupolev Tu-134B-3, experienced engine failure while climbing. The pilots performed a forced landing that required a sharp right turn to avoid an apartment block. The aircraft crashed in the south-western outskirts of Nakhchivan, from the airport runway. The crash became Azerbaijan Airlines' deadliest accident. The airline no longer operates the Tu-134. Aircraft The Tu-134B-3 involved in the accident, (c/n 63383), was manufactured on 28 August 1980 and was powered by two Soloviev D-30 turbofan engines. The aircraft had flown 27,500 hours of its 35,000 flight hour life before the crash, was last serviced on 25 July 1995, and an unspecified repair was carried out on 30 March 1993. The engines had operated roughly 16,000 hours out of their assigned 18,000 hour life and were last serviced on 27 November 1995. The no. 1 (left) engine had undergone eight unspecified repairs and the no. 2 (right) five unspecified repairs before the crash. Crash The aircraft took off from Nakhchivan at 17:52 local time. At an altitude of and an airspeed of , the no. 1 engine failed. The co-pilot Sergey Kuliyev, who was at the controls, responded by countering the left bank, but five seconds later the flight engineer Alexander Sokolov reported, in error, that the no. 2 engine had failed. The captain Eduard Hasanov took over control of the aircraft. However, because the co-pilot had countered the left bank, the captain did not have the sensory information which could have alerted him that it was the no. 1 engine that had failed. The aircraft continued to climb. The captain then ordered the no. 2 engine to be shut down. The flight engineer restarted the right throttle and noticed that the power on the working engine was decreasing, he then pushed the no. 2 throttle back to full power, but the no. 2 engine had already stopped. Eight seconds later, the flight engineer reported that both engines had failed. The aircraft climbed to an altitude of , while the speed had decreased to . The captain decided to make an emergency landing, but encountered an apartment block and made a sharp right turn to avoid it. The aircraft crashed into a field with a 37-degree right bank and a sink rate of . Thirty people out of eighty-two on-board survived the accident (twenty-six passengers and four crew members). Investigation A joint investigation by the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee, aircraft manufacturer, engine manufacturer and Azerbaijani Ministry of National Security was launched. Azerbaijan Airlines believed defective spare parts caused the crash. The joint investigation commission found that vibration caused the nuts on the engine mounts to loosen and fall off. This caused the engine turbines to shift and become damaged, leading to the crash. Azerbaijan Airlines deputy head Nazim Javadov, however, said the use of the defective parts for repairs was permitted by the engine manufacturer, Russian company Perm Motors.

Roger von Gunten (born 1933) is an artist and sculptor, originally from Zurich, but in 1980 became a naturalized Mexican citizen. He was the subject of a 1978 essay by Jomí García Ascot and was part of the Breakaway Generation which emerged after World War II ending the Mexican Muralist era. For over a decade, he was involved in a legal battle over who defines what is art. He has participated in over 200 national and international art exhibitions and won the 2014 Fine Art Medal from Mexico. Biography Roger von Gunten was born 29 March 1933 in Zurich, Switzerland. He was a student at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Arts and Crafts) in Zurich studying under Johannes Itten a color theorist of the Bauhaus school. He held his first solo show in Switzerland in 1956. In 1957, he came to Mexico with a plan to travel on south along the newly opened Pan-American Highway, but he ran out of money and stayed in Mexico. He initially studied etching at the Universidad Iberoamericana with Guillermo Silva Santamaria in Mexico City, but having little love for city life, soon moved to Tacámbaro in the State of Michoacán. Later, he moved to a home on the slopes of Tepozteco Mountain near the village of Tepoztlan, in Morelos. He was a part of the movement known as Generación de la Ruptura (Breakaway Generation) who turned their back on the Mexican muralism of the previous generation of painters. It was a move away from formulaic social expression toward more personal abstract expression of forms. Von Gunten's artwork is generally divided into three periods. The early period, which lasted through the 1970s was more painterly, impressionistic and playful, transforming the landscape with a blue-green palette of joyful expression. His middle period in the mid-1980s was dark with smudges of color. A palette of in black, blue and crimson tones merged with text in collages aimed to depict the anger of a volcano or disgust with war. Since the 1990s, his work has been a representation of imaginary forms of nature depicted in whimsical, imaginative ways. Von Gunten uses yoga to assist in his creative process and his latter works evoke Hindi thought and spirituality. Von Gunten became a naturalized Mexican citizen in 1980. In 1982, he signed a contract with Serapión Fernández Stark, who was to promote von Gunten's work through Impulsora Art-Lat which later became Promotora de Arte Pictórico (Pictorial Art Promoters). In 1986, Art-Lat began to break its promises and unfulfill the terms signed in the contracts, so von Gunten became dissatisfied with the distribution of his work and refused to deliver any more paintings. Stark demanded fulfillment of the contractual terms and a legal battle ensued. Initially von Gunten was ordered to pay Stark in paintings and not cash, so he painted 19 paintings to satisfy the judgment. Stark refused to accept the paintings, claiming that the style was not typical for von Gunten's work. The ensuing litigation dragged out for more than a decade. In 1994, 90 artists and intellectuals backed von Gunten's art and arranged an exhibit to display his works hanging alongside their own. At issue was whether artists have the right to free expression or whether critics, art dealers, or the courts determine the definition of art. On 10 November 1998 a district judge revoked the federal recognition that had accepted that the 19 paintings, known as Espejo (the Mirror), were satisfactory to settle the judgment. Von Gunten, who had left Mexico for a year of study in Indonesia when the paintings were accepted, called for another review on 9 April 1999. In 2001, von Guntun lost the 9th appeal and was ordered to sell his home in settlement of the debt. A retrospective of his works was presented at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1989, containing over 200 of his works. In 1991 he created the scenery for the opera by Daniel Catán “La hija de Rapaccini” (the daughter of Rapaccini) which was performed at the Bellas Artes. In 1993 von Gunten became a member of the National System of Art Creators, Conaculta-Fonca. He has had numerous solo and group exhibitions both nationally and internationally and has lectured throughout the Mexican Republic. Von Gunten has been the subject of several literary works. In 1978, he was the subject of an essay written by Jomí García Ascot. In 1999, Santiago Espinosa de los Monteros published Roger Von Gunten: La Inocente Precision del Caos and in 2004 Silvia Cherem included him in her book Trazos y revelaciones: entrevistas a diez artistas mexicanos.

Later, he would overcome his anger and spend a pleasant evening with Tolstoy playing Beethoven piano sonatas for him (Goldovsky was an excellent pianist). In the early years of the twentieth century, he wrote his History of the Jews of Moscow Gol’dovskii, Onissim Borisovich, \\"Evrei v Moskve (po neopublikovannym dokumentam)\\" in Burmistrov, Konstantin, ed., Moskva Evreiskaya: Sbornik Statei I Materialov.\\" Berlin, 1906 which revealed patterns of Russian anti-Semitism going back centuries. The book was published in Berlin in 1906 since no Russian publisher would touch it. Goldovsky also supported Jewish playwrights and authors such as the struggling Jewish playwright Semon Solomovich Iushkevich, who modeled the hero of one of his plays on Goldovsky. Relationship with Lea Luboshutz In 1903, Goldovsky went to a party at which the 18-year-old violin prodigy Lea Luboshutz was performing. Goldovsky offered to accompany her in a few numbers. The two fell in love and by 1908, he was living with her, the first of their three children having been born the previous year.Luboshutz, Lea, Lubo: Four Generations of Music, Unpublished memoir, undated second version (first version dated 1936) Goldovsky continued his marriage with Khin, maintaining a room in his wife's house while living primarily with Luboshutz. With Khin, he attended political events and worked to support her theatre activities. Goldovsky and Luboshutz's apartment was a center of activity for Moscow's artistic crowd and included overnight stays from touring artists like Pablo Casals. Masonic Lodge After the 1905 Revolution, many liberals like Goldovsky who had fled came home briefly. But their hopes were dashed by the dissolution of the First Duma and some fled once again. Others like Goldovsky, who stayed, faced increasing repression and needed to find a way to meet secretly. Masonry, with its strict membership rules and emphasis on total loyalty, was the perfect solution. A Grand Orient de France Lodge opened in St. Petersburg in 1906, followed by one in Moscow founded by Prince Sergei Dmitrievich Urusov (a distant cousin of Onissim's mentor) around November 1906 (the actual date is in dispute). Goldovsky underwent a typical rite of passage.Bebutov, David Iosifovich, \\"Memoirs,\\" Biblioteka Istoriya (An Online Collection of Unpublished Ressian- Language Historical Documents), p.143.

The Russian Revolution and Final Years Goldovsky was in Saint Petersburg during the February Revolution of 1917. According to his wife's diary, he was ecstatic.Khin-Goldovsky, R. M., op. cit, Fund 128 1 32 But he had misread events. By the end of the year, his law practice became irrelevant and he and Luboshutz were forced to share their Moscow apartment with another family.Goldovsky, Boris and Curtis Cate, op. cit. Luboshutz now supported the family by performing in factories in exchange for food. Jewels and fancy clothes were pawned. As conditions deteriorated, they planned to emigrate but it was not easy. Taking their 13-year-old son Boris as her piano accompanist, Luboshutz departed first with plans for Onissim to follow. But the strain of conditions, including repeated questioning by the authorities and threat of imprisonment, led to a cerebral hemorrhage followed by Goldovsky's immediate death at the age of 56.http://all- photo.ru/portret/goldovsky/index.ru.html?kk=9cfa9e03e7 (accessed April 21, 2015) Family Goldovsky had no children with his wife, Rashel Khin.Balin, Carole B., op. cit. With Luboshutz, he had three children. The oldest, Yuri, became a mathematician in the Soviet Union but was killed in a mountaineering accident in 1931. The second son, Boris Goldovsky, became a successful opera producer and conductor in America. A daughter, Irina, also came to America, married, and had six children.Documentation of Goldovsky's children and grandchildren are given in Goldovsky & Cate, op. cit.

Alaska had previously recognized that right to privacy with respect to possession and use of cannabis with the 1975 Ravin v. State case in the Alaska Supreme Court. The state legislature then decriminalized marijuana in 1982. The measure's passage in 1990 met with a variety of court challenges over the years before being struck down in 2003 by the Alaska Court of Appeals in Noy v. State. Reversing the decision of this measure, Alaska voters ultimately legalized marijuana with a different Measure 2 in 2014. Results Campaign The leader of the initiative campaign Alaskans for the Recriminalization of Marijuana was Marie Majewske, described as an \\"Anchorage grandmother\\". The initiative also received support from William Bennett, President Bush's Drug Czar, who planned to visit Alaska to campaign for the measure; the DEA and FBI also sponsored a Marijuana Myths and Misconceptions symposium in Anchorage. Opposition to the initiative was led by Alaskans for Privacy, and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) gave top priority to defeating the initiative, contributing \\"nearly $16,000\\" to opposition efforts by late September. Polling across Alaska in August of that year showed a nearly 2–1 margin of support for the measure. Gubernatorial candidates Arliss Sturgulewski (Republican) and Walter Hickel (Alaskan Independence Party) supported the initiative, while Democrat Tony Knowles supported criminalization but not incarceration for first-time offenders. At the successful end of the campaign, Majewske announced: > It's wonderful, I have great faith in the people of this state. I truly > believed they would do the right thing. I think that this will say to people > that the law didn't work, and we need to be looking in the other direction, > toward a drug-free environment for our children.

Despite its name, the bridge does not carry or cross L Street, but it is adjacent to L Street's western terminus. (Drawing 10) The construction of the original bridge at this site was delayed by long-standing legal issues with the owners of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which terminated at Rock Creek close to the position of the bridge. A lawsuit was initiated as early as 1912, but a resolution was not forthcoming. The situation changed in 1924 when a major flood damaged the canal to the point where it was uneconomical to repair it, strengthening the government's legal position. By 1931 these difficulties had been overcome and the bridge was scheduled to be completed by 1933.Davis, Timothy (1992). History and Description, pp. 10-12, 92, 98-100 As the center portion of the parkway between K Street and P Street was the last to be completed, the L Street Bridge was initially unused while work continued.

The original versions of both the L Street Bridge and Shoreham Hill Bridge were purposely built in a utilitarian style, using salvaged steel trusses from the Georgetown Aqueduct Bridge, in order to encourage the public to demand to replace them.

The Gest Oriental Library is named in honor of Guion Moore Gest (1864-1948), whose collection of Chinese books and manuscripts formed the Gest Chinese Research Library. The Gest Research Library was officially opened on February 13 (Chinese New Year's Day), 1926, at McGill University in Montreal. It was renamed the Gest Oriental Library when the collection was moved to Princeton in 1937. The library's holdings were expanded into Japanese and Korean after World War II to form one of the largest collections in North America. The Chinese collection is especially strong in Ming dynasty editions and works on traditional Chinese medicine., p. 974. History of the Gest Collection The original collection Guion Moore Gest built one of the largest collections of Chinese language rare books in North America in spite of the fact that he was not especially wealthy and could not read Chinese. Hu Shih, a prominent scholar who served as curator 1950-1952, noted that the collection, which \\"began as a hobby and developed into an investment, soon became a burden to a founder\\". Gest travelled often to Asia in the 1910s and 1920s on business for the Gest Engineering Company, which he founded and headed. As early as the 1890s he developed an interest in Buddhism and bought a Japanese manuscript scroll. He retained Chen Baozhen, a Chinese scholar who had been an imperial tutor, to locate and purchase books for his collection. Chen assembled more than 8,000 volumes, (juan?) mostly standard works.There is often confusion in English because a Chinese traditional string-sewn \\"book\\" can be made up of a number of juan, that is, \\"volumes\\" or \\"fascicles.\\" Often it is not clear whether \\"volume\\" means \\"book\\" in the Western sense or \\"fascicle.\\" After Chen's death in 1900, Gest retained an agent in Beijing, Commander I.V. Gillis (1875-1948), a retired United States Naval Attaché. He spoke Mandarin Chinese fluently, but could not read classical Chinese texts that had not been punctuated. He developed intimate knowledge through many years of handling books, however, and a leading Chinese bibliographer who examined his collection and his catalogues wrote that \\"his knowledge of Chinese bibliography is exceptionally good\\". Gillis' wife was a Manchu princess, and his web of personal relations led him to the Guangxu emperor's tutor and other high officials with collections of useful volumes. Gest suffered from glaucoma, and Gillis suggested that he try an eye medicine which was a specialty the Ma family of Dingxian, Hebei province, who kept a shop in the capital. This medicine sparked Gest's interest in traditional Chinese medicine and in collecting books on the subject. Because Gest's funds were limited, Gillis bought selectively, concentrating on works printed in the Ming and Qing dynasties, which were of less interest to wealthy Chinese and Japanese collectors than works printed in the Song dynasty. He acquired \\"Palace editions,\\" treatises printed by government agencies, commercial publishers, and manuscripts from all parts of the country. He did not always insist on rare editions, though he bought a great many. Gest and Gillis acquired some 500 works in 2,000 juan on Chinese medicine, the largest such collection in the West at the time. Probably the most important single work in the history of Chinese medicine, Li Shizhen's Bencao gangmu (The Compendium of Materia Medica), for instance, was published in the 16th century, but the collection's edition is a 19th-century reprint. Together with later additions, the collection offers material all aspects of medical thought and practice, as well as the history of Chinese science. Gillis' staff of three searched bookstores and examined private collections. Gillis had worked in American naval intelligence, and enjoyed using his training to demonstrate to his friends how to determine that the same person had used different typewriters by the similar weight of their strokes. He once verified the date of a purported Sung dynasty book by examining the paper fiber under a microscope. He and his staff marked missing or damaged pages with signed slips and had damaged books interleaved, rebound, and boxed. Gillis catalogued the books, which meant that they were ready to shelve upon arrival in North America, and he even crated and shipped the furniture and wall decorations that were used first at McGill and then at Princeton. In 1928 Gest hired the third person responsible for the early buildup of the collection, Nancy Lee Swann, a returned missionary who was then finishing her doctoral degree in Chinese studies at Columbia University. She moved to Toronto and supplied a professional competence needed to turn a collection of rarities into a working collection. The catalogue of the collection had been prepared by the first curator, whose Chinese was not adequate. Gillis called it \\"truly pathetic.\\" Swann revised the catalogue and became curator in 1933. She remained curator until her retirement in 1946. Gest, Gillis, and Dr. Swann built the collection from some 232 titles in 8,000 fascicles in 1928 to close to 130,000 by the time the collection was moved to Princeton. By 1932, Gest's Chinese collection at McGill was second in size only to that of the Library of Congress. Gest explained his motivations in building his collection and establishing the library at McGill: :There has been no attempt at any time to buy in volume for quantity's sake alone, but the one object has been to obtain the best of the old works that could be secured and perpetuate them in a home where a full realization could be made by the Western World of the culture of China. (\\"A Statement from the Founder\\") quoted in Perushek (1985) p. 18 Gest and Swann energetically promoted use of the collection. In 1933, Gest promoted a project for doctors at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research to research the use of acupuncture to stimulate the sympathetic nervous sysyem. Swann welcomed prominent sinologists and authors such as Berthold Laufer and L. Carrington Goodrich, and Pearl S. Buck, as well as applying for research funds with the American Council of Learned Societies. The Gest collection fell behind in its rivalry with the Library of Congress because McGill could not offer support. The economic crisis of the 1930s put the collection and the library at risk. After 1934, McGill could no longer pay Swann's salary or provide quarters for the collection and closed the Chinese studies program that had been started only a few years earlier. Gest at first paid Swann's salary of $2,000 when he could, but his eyesight and business were both failing. For several years Swann worked without pay and Gillis used $10,000 of his own savings to purchase and ship acquisitions. The move to Princeton Gest explored selling the collection to Harvard or Yale universities, but finally turned to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research for help in purchasing the collection back from McGill, and then donating it to the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies The Institute, however, had no expertise in the area and the university had no program in Chinese studies. In contrast to the spacious and comfortable rooms in Toronto, the collection was now housed in what Swann called \\"makeshift quarters\\" in the basement of 20 Nassau Street, a storefront building owned by the university. Dr. Swann, the only full-time staff member, had responsibility for all aspects of the library, from cataloging to checking out books to guiding visiting scholars through the collection. During a heavy storm, she had to rouse the janitorial staff to place barriers on the floor above to keep water from coming through. Guion Moore Gest died in 1948, as did his longtime agent Gillis. Swann received a paycheck marked \\"FINAL\\". She protested that she was entitled to three months' notice, but the trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study extended her retirement by only two months. When Princeton's Firestone Library was completed in 1948, the Institute transferred the Gest Collection transferred there. Postwar growth During World War II and the early post-war years, the university established programs in Chinese and Japanese studies, which required increased library holdings. From 1950 to 1952, the curator was Hu Shih, distinguished Chinese scholar and former ambassador from China to the United States. Hu engaged James Tung (Dong Shigang) as his assistant, who became Curator and served from 1952 to 1977. The collection expanded substantially under Tung's curatorship. Princeton faculty member Frederick W. Mote guided further development on the Chinese side, and Marius Jansen led a major expansion of Japanese holdings. The collection of Japanese historical documents and publications became particularly rich.The collection was renamed the Princeton East Asian Library, though often called the Gest Library. In 1972 the collection was transferred to Palmer and Jones Halls. The collection at the time of the move to Princeton in 1937 held some 100,000 volumes (juan), 40% of which were manuscripts, early printings, and rare editions. The 24,000 volumes of works printed in the Ming dynasty made it one of the largest in the West. After World War II, the collection became the third largest in the US, after the Harvard-Yenching collection (which it had once outranked), and the Library of Congress holdings, which are almost twice as large. In 2016, the library held roughly 425,000 volumes of Chinese books, with a special strength in pre-modern literature and history; some 163,000 volumes of Japanese language book; a smaller collection of Korean language books; and more than 20,000 western language volumes. Acquisition librarians specialize in each of the major areas.

This beetle is known as a pest that causes damage to oak trees and is a factor in oak decline. The adult beetle is 8 to 13 millimeters long. It is metallic green in color with a black or yellow cast.Domingue, M. J., et al. (2011). Field observations of visual attraction of three European oak buprestid beetles toward conspecific and heterospecific models. Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 140(2), 112-21. There is a pair of white spots on the inner edges of the elytra. The larva is a creamy white color and measures up to 43 millimeters in length. The first thoracic segment is enlarged. The grub is legless and has a pair of horns on its last abdominal segment. Female beetles have an average lifespan of 2 months, but some may live upwards of 5 months.Reed, K., Denman, S., Leather, S. R., Forster, J., & Inward, D. J. G. (2018). The lifecycle of Agrilus biguttatus: the role of temperature in its development and distribution, and implications for Acute Oak Decline. Agricultural & Forest Entomology, 20(3), 334–346. The main hosts of this insect are oak species, including English oak (Quercus robur), sessile oak (Q. petraea), downy oak (Q. pubescens), evergreen oak (Q. ilex), cork oak (Q. suber) and turkey oak (Q. cerris). The beetle can also be found on European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and chestnut (Castanea sativa). The beetle develops under the bark of the tree and produces damage to the wood during pupation. The female lays clusters of eggs in cracks in the bark and the larvae feed on the inner bark and outermost layer of wood. They produce long, zig-zag galleries in the tissues of the tree as they dig. This action causes girdling of the tree, preventing the circulation of nutrients through its tissues. The following spring, the adults emerge through holes in the bark and feed on the leaves of the tree. This species typically attacks trees that are stressed by insect damage, frost, or drought. It kills trees by the girdling action of the larvae. It contributes to oak dieback, large-scale losses of stands of oak trees caused by several factors. The beetle favors mature oaks with trunks over 30 centimeters in diameter. The adult beetle can fly several kilometers. It can also be transported to new areas with shipments of wood. Natural enemies of the beetle include woodpeckers, which dig the larvae from the bark. A number of parasitoid wasps utilize the larvae, including Spathius curvicaudus, S. ligniarius, S. radzayanus, Atanycolus neesii,Moraal, L. G. & Hilszczanski, J. (2000).

Pregnant women are often given special privileges and are considered to be beautiful, fragile, and vulnerable to evil spirits. Therefore, women may seek guidance from a religious or spiritual diviner to protect their fetus or to increase their chances of conceiving. For example, the Akan may carry akuaba dolls, a fertility symbol, during pregnancy to ensure that they will birth a healthy and beautiful baby that resembles the doll's exaggerated features. Infertility Due to the cultural implications and the importance of bearing children, infertility in Ghana can be devastating. Throughout the years, Ghanaians have believed that both physical and spiritual ailments are the cause of infertility. Some people believe that a womb could be too hot or too cold to support a developing baby. Others believe that the cause of their infertility is witchcraft, and this belief is often supported by traditional priests who assert that the woman can be rid of a witch's curse and be allowed to conceive if the priest performs a rite in which he asks fertility gods how they can be appeased. Other spiritual beliefs involving infertility include the belief that infertility is the result of a woman's disobedience to God, in which the remedy is prayer and repentance. Women who consult a tradition birth attendant are likely to be told that prayer is the medicine for infertility, although they acknowledge that infertility is sometimes caused by a physical ailment. In these cases, the traditional birth attendant may blame the infertility on stomach aches and advise the woman to visit a hospital and take the medicine given by the doctor. Prenatal care Cultural influences and sociodemographic characteristics play an important role in a woman's decision to seek maternal-child health services. These influences and characteristics include level of education, religious affiliation, region of residence, ethnicity, and occupation. In most communities, maternal-child health services coexist with traditional indigenous health care, and pregnant women in these rural areas may choose between modern medicine, herbalists, diviners, and spiritualists for care. The use of a doctor for prenatal care is low among women living in rural areas of Greater Accra and the Northern and Upper regions of Ghana. 23.1% of Protestant and Catholic women, and 10.3% of traditional women consult a doctor for prenatal care. The majority of women believe that antenatal care from a health professional is necessary to determine that their pregnancy is normal, to see that the fetus is well- positioned, to learn about when they were expected to deliver, to obtain a tetanus immunization, for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses during pregnancy, and nutritional advice. The barriers to seeking antenatal care include travel time and distance from health care facilities, the high cost, and the inconvenient hours of operations of the clinics. Some women also did not want people to know they were pregnant until their third month of pregnancy, and would wait until then to seek antenatal care.Users of Health Professionals for Obstetric Care in Northern Ghana, page 51 Inexpensive care from traditional birth attendants included routine antenatal care, however untrained attendants and traditional healers did not provide antenatal care. Pregnancy food beliefs and practices Knowledge about nutrition in Ghana is obtained through formal education, community health services, friends and families, cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs of the community. The majority of foods consumed by Ghanaian women during pregnancy were foods indigenous to Ghanaian diets in general such as green leafy vegetables, meats, fish, fruits, and legumes. They also consume foreign foods such as dairy products, biscuits, and beverages such as tea and powdered mixes.Food Beliefs and Practices During Pregnancy in Ghana: Implications for Maternal Health Interventions, page 960 Recommended raw foods during pregnancy include: bananas, oranges, papaya, pineapples, carrots, cabbage, lettuce, honey, and kwawu nsua/nsaman troba. Recommended cooked foods include bean stew with palm oil and boiled white rice, bread, fried anchovies, smoked mackerel, snails in soup, stews with eggs and vegetables, palm nut soup with fufu and rice, and Nkontomire stew which is made with palm oil and boiled sweet cassava, or plantain, or yam. The beliefs about beneficial foods during pregnancy are based on their understanding of how certain foods can prevent anemia, enhance physical strength, support the development of the fetus, and minimize physiological disruption. Women in Ghana also believe there are foods one must avoid during pregnancy. Most women agree that excess fat and sugar are harmful during pregnancy, and Fante and Akwapim women have beliefs about specific foods to avoid which include sugarcane, coconut, oranges, pineapple, chilli pepper, ground nut soup, eggs, high fat and high sugar foods, cooking oils, salt, and clay. Abortion and contraceptive use In 1985, the abortion law passed in Ghana allowed for legal and safe abortion by a qualified medical practitioner for pregnancies that resulted from rape or incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life of the woman or her physical or mental health, or if there is substantial risk that the fetus would suffer from a serious physical anomaly or devastating disease. Many women in Ghana are not aware that abortion is legal in their country and tend to seek unsafe abortion providers and receive unsafe care afterwards. As a result, more than 11% of maternal deaths are due to unsafe abortions, making it the second most common death in women in Ghana. According to the 2007 Ghana Maternal Health Survey (GMHS), 7% of all pregnancies end in abortion. The incidences of abortion are higher in women who are 20–24 years old, educated and wealthy women, and women who live in urban areas.< Contraceptive use is low in Ghana with about 24% of women using contraceptives in 2008. 35% Of married women in Ghana are in need of contraceptives, but are not using any. Labor Traditional beliefs about labor People believed that women who were not faithful to their husbands would experience prolonged labor, and male traditional healers would remark that a promiscuous woman would have to tell every person in the room the number of men she has slept with apart from her husband before she would be able to give birth. Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a bottle to blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding. Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them. Birth Most deliveries in Ghana are attended by untrained personnel, including traditional birth attendants, and most traditional birth attendants in rural areas are illiterate elderly farmers. Many women choose traditional birth attendants because of the lower cost, and because they live in the community and are able to assist quickly. They are known to assist with bathing the newborn, and giving advice on breastfeeding and newborn care. Traditional birth attendants deliver in cases on uncomplicated labor and are able to refer women to health care facilities when complications arise. Place of delivery The majority of Ghanaian women deliver at home with a traditional birth attendant and are referred to the hospital in cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also too embarrassed to go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to deliver at home where no one could see that they were poor. Decision- making In general, men have most of the decision-making power in Ghanaian society.Culture and Customs of Ghana, page 140 In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the households also make most of the decisions in collaboration with the birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer. During labor, the husband will usually make the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to think clearly due to the pain, although the head of the household will have the final say. In some cases, women, especially those who can afford to go to a hospital, will make their own decision about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads. Placenta Traditionally, the placenta has been buried outside of the house to show that the ancestors of the family has accepted the baby. Postpartum The older women in the compound or community look after women in their postpartum period and assist with cleaning the baby and massage. Mothers receive postpartum teaching from the older women in the community. In the early postpartum period, there is great emphasis placed on the health and well-being of the mother and infant. Breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence is mandatory. Both mother and baby receive massages using shea-butter, palm kernel oil, and other oils. During this time, different colored and sized beads are tied around the wrist, waist, and ankles to monitor the growth of the infant. Older women will also keep a brass bowl full of herbs, mixtures, white clay, soft sponge, and charcoal. These items are believed to prevent health problems for the infant and mother. Care of the newborn When babies are born, they are kept indoors for seven days because Ghanaians believe that this is the period in which they are most vulnerable to both physical and spiritual harm. During this period, it is believed that the child is wandering between the spiritual and physical world and may decide to go back to the spiritual world at any point. They are known as strangers until the end of the seven days when they are acknowledged and welcomed into society with an elaborate naming ceremony, or outdooring ceremony. Outdooring ceremony In Ghana, an Outdooring (Ga: kpodziemo; ) is the traditional naming ceremony for infants.https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/outdooring Traditionally this ceremony occurs eight days after the child is born where parents bring their newborn \\"outdoors\\" for the first time and give the child a day name. Cultural beliefs dictated that after eight days, the infant was likely to survive and could be provided a name. In addition to the day name, Ghanaians frequently give children a name of an elder relative, either living or deceased. During the Outdooring, male infants would be circumcised and female infants would have their ears pierced Currently in Ghana, many of these practices including naming, circumcision, and ear piercing are done after birth within the hospital, and the Outdooring serves as a symbolic ceremony and celebration of birth. Circumcision In the past, boys in Ghanaian society often do not undergo circumcision as an infant. Boys will receive circumcision as they undergo initiation into adulthood at the age of ten to fourteen years of age. Ghanaians believe that the circumcision represents cleanliness and the pain will make the boys physically and mentally stronger. With the advent of modern medicine however, male children are circumcised from as early as four (4) days after they are born, and this is normally done at the hospitals or locally by Wanzams, special men trained in circumcision.

Emerson, son of Professor Ralph Emerson, D.D. and Eliza (Rockwell) Emerson, was born on May 28, 1821, at Norfolk, Connecticut, where his father was at the time pastor of the Congregational church. In 1829 his father became Professor of Ecclesiastical History in Andover Theological Seminary, in Andover, Massachusetts, and he was prepared for college at Phillips Academy in that place. During his senior year at Yale College he was one of the editors of the Yale Literary Magazine. He graduated from Yale in 1841. After graduation he was principal of the Union Academy in New London, Connecticut, a year, spent two years in Andover Theological Seminary, and was then tutor in Yale College from September 1844 to April 1848. He was licensed to preach while tutor, and was ordained a Congregational minister on February 22, 1860. Receiving the appointment of Professor of Ancient Languages in Beloit College, Wisconsin, he entered upon his duties in May 1848, after an eventful journey thither, which ended with a two days' ride in an open buggy across the prairie from Milwaukee. Five students formed the first freshman class, and the material equipment consisted of an incomplete brick building. Professor Emerson's department was divided in 1855, and his chair was thereafter that of Greek. He was also librarian for many years. By his students he was known as Zeus, so powerful was his influence upon their characters as well as upon their scholarship. On the fortieth anniversary of his connection with Beloit College, in May 1888, Professor Emerson was remembered with many letters and other testimonials from Beloit graduates and other friends. One gift bore an inscription from Xenophon's Memorabilia of Socrates, \\"Having caused many to set their hearts upon attaining a noble manliness of life.\\" By quietly interesting friends in the college he secured altogether an addition of $150,000 to its funds, and to him and his classmate, Professor Jackson J. Bushnell, who assumed his duties at Beloit only a few weeks earlier, much of the high repute and usefulness of the college is undoubtedly due. In June 1870, Professor Emerson went abroad, and spent over a year in travel and study in Europe, Palestine and Egypt. In November 1888, on account of his health, he made another trip to Europe, remaining abroad a year and a half. After his return he did not resume his active duties, but resided part of the time in Beloit, and part of the time in Evanston, Illinois. He was greatly interested in the development of the Art Department of Beloit College, which was started in 1892 by the gift of Mrs. Emerson's collection. He was the author of many addresses, sermons, lectures and magazine articles, several of which have been printed in pamphlet form. He issued in 1897 a volume of Lectures and Sermons. He also revised and published the History of Philosophy, left by his deceased brother-in-law, Prof Joseph Haven, D.D. He was a member of the Connecticut and Wisconsin Academies of Arts and Sciences, and of the American Philological Association. He received the degree of D D. from Yale in 1880, and of LL.D. from Beloit in 1897. He married at New Britain, Connecticut, on September 1, 1852, Mary Cordelia, daughter of Alvin North, Esq, and sister of the wife of his classmate, Samuel Brace, and of Hubert F. North. She died in 1879, after many years of ill health. On July 9, 1884, he married Helen Frances, daughter of Harvey and Hannah Thirstin (Thompson) Brace, of Evanston, Illinois, and formerly a teacher in Wellesley College. Emerson died of general debility at his home in Beloit, on August 4, 1900, at the age of 79 years. His widow, and a son and daughter by his first wife survived him. The son was a trustee of Beloit College and the daughter graduated from Wellesley College in 1891.

The only organization that has been found to have selected an All-Big Ten team in 1991 was the Associated Press (AP), based on voting by the media. The AP's All-Big Ten team was led by Michigan receiver Desmond Howard who was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year and Iowa defensive end Leroy Smith and Wisconsin cornerback Troy Vincent who were named the Big Ten Defensive Players of the Year. Howard led the conference with 985 receiving yards, 21 touchdowns from scrimmage, and 19 receiving touchdowns. Howard also won multiple national player of the year awards, winning the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award and Walter Camp Player of the Year Award. The 1991 Michigan Wolverines football team were undefeated in conference play and won the conference football championship. In addition to Desmond Howard, Michigan quarterback Elvis Grbac led the conference with a 161.7 passing efficiency rating and 25 passing touchdowns, and was selected as the first-team All-Big Ten quarterback for three consecutive years, receiving the honor in 1991, 1992 and 1993. Six other Michigan players received first-team honors from the AP, including running back Ricky Powers (1,197 rushing yards), offensive linemen Matt Elliott and Greg Skrepenak, defensive lineman Mike Evans, linebacker Erick Anderson, and kicker J. D. Carlson. Skrepenak was recognized as the Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year, and Michigan head coach Gary Moeller was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year. The 1991 Iowa Hawkeyes football team under head coach Hayden Fry finished in second place in the conference with a 10–1–1 record, but placed only two players on the AP's all-conference first team. The Iowa honorees were center Mike Devlin and defensive lineman Leroy Smith. Smith was also named the Big Ten Co-Defensive Player of the Year and the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year. Iowa quarterback Matt Rodgers was also selected by the AP as the second-team quarterback.

For the first two centuries of its existence, the school was a charity school. A Sankt Petri Girls' School was founded by Balthasar Münter (father of the solonist Friederike Bruun) in the second half of the 18th century. A new building for the school was inaugurated at Larslejsstræde 5 in 1899. The complex also comprised a new home for Skt. Petri kirkes, Thymes og P.s plejestiftelse, a home for elderly indigent, Herman expatriates. It had been established in the beginning of the 19th century through a merger of three independent institutions: Thymes Stiftelse founded by Winand Thyme in 1775. Pelts Stiftelse founded by Abraham Pelt in 1779 and a third one operated by the church. Most of the residents were German expatriate women. In 1997, the building was sold to the school which needed more space for its increasing number of students. In 2010 a gymnasialer superstructure was established. In the school year 2015/2016 17 students attended the 10, 8 students, the 11 and 1 students 12th grade. Programmes The school serves levels kl. 0 to 12.

It was screened in the International Critics' Week section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. The film stars Koudous Seihon and Alassane Sy as friends who cross the Mediterranean Sea to immigrate to Italy, where they experience unexpected hostility from locals. Plot Ayiva makes the difficult journey from Burkina Faso through Algeria and Libya and eventually reaches Italy. He pays for his passage and sees his compatriots robbed along the way. In southern Italy, he lives in a squatted property while earning some money from orange picking, and petty thieving, and sends some money back to his family in Africa. The Africans are exploited for their cheap labour while not being welcomed by local villagers, although Ayiva is welcomed into the home of one Italian family, the Fondacaros. He tried to discourage his sister from leaving Africa to try and join him in Europe. After one of their colleagues is attacked by Italian police, many of the refugees begin a protest against their treatment and start damaging property and cars in the village. They are attacked in turn by some of the villagers. This escalates into a riot; Italian police arrive and fire tear gas toward the protesters, and then attack them. Ayiva manages to escape down a side alley but then has to flee from a crowd of angry villagers; his friend Abas is caught and beaten up. The crowd run off at the sound of approaching sirens; Abas is left lying in the street badly injured. Ayiva manages to get him taken back to the Fondacaro family, who try to treat his injuries. A local refugee charity suggests that Abas would be able to get a residency permit for a year, because of his injuries, but Ayiva says they would rather return home to Africa. He speaks to his sister and daughter via Skype. He is helping serve drinks for the Fondacaros at a family celebration when they invite him inside, and the film ends with the sound of the pop music from the party as Ayiva slowly walks inside.

Early life Harrison grew up in Jarrow, England and attended Valley View Junior School. He left school at 15 when he became an apprentice fitter at Swan Hunter shipyard. In 1985, he took up photography and in June 1990, Harrison graduated alongside Simon Starling and Nick Waplington with an honours degree in photographic studies from Trent Polytechnic, Nottingham. It was also at this time that Harrison served in The Light Infantry (7th Durham Battalion) and qualified as a sniper. Works Whatever Happened to Audra Patterson? In 1991, Harrison was awarded a Northern Arts Production Award to make the work \\"Whatever Happened to Audra Patterson?\\"The series is reproduced here within Harrison's site. Taking as his starting point his own Valley View Junior school class photo from 1978, Harrison located all but one of his former classmates and photographed them. Audra Patterson, who had hidden behind another pupil in the class photo was never found, thus giving rise to the title. Consisting of twenty-nine large scale colour portraits, the work has \\"the formal appearance of portraiture but the conceptual stance of documentary\\", and has been described as countering the tradition of grainy black and white romanticism of the working class. This work has been seen as \\"using documentary photography as a tool of history\\" and in which \\"there is certainly an implicit political critique…one which operates to disperse the accumulated romantic baggage which surrounds North-Eastern photography.\\" The work was shown at the Zone Photographic Gallery Newcastle in 1992 and featured in the Independent Magazine. Under the Hood. In the spring of 1993, after Simon Grennan (Kartoon Kings) had seen \\"Whatever happened to Audra Patterson?\\" in the Independent magazine, Harrison was commissioned by the Viewpoint Gallery, Salford to make the work \\"Under the Hood\\".The series is reproduced here within Harrison's site. Working closely with a group of young men on the Pendleton Estate in Salford, Harrison used the conventions of Renaissance portraiture to show a different side of young men who were seen as dangerous and marginal. The autobiographical nature of Harrison's work is apparent. When talking about the young men he photographed Harrison stated \\"The only thing that separates me from them is luck…I photograph to find out about myself, to find out where I'm coming from\\" Described by Val Williams as \\"one of the few photo series to emerge from the new British colour documentary which neither satirised nor objectified a group in society, which saw itself as marginalised, bound into, and emerging from, a culture of poverty and lack of opportunity.\\" \\"Under the Hood\\" was later shown at the 1998 Rencontres d'Arles photography festival, Arles, France. As part of the group show \\"Les Anglais vus par les Anglais\\" (trans. How the English see the English). Noblesse Oblige. In 1995 Photoworks commissioned Harrison to undertake the first in a series of Country Life commissions in the English town of Petworth.

Sites of Memory In 1995 Harrison began his long-term project, \\"Sites of Memory\\"The series is reproduced here within Harrison's site. consisting of panoramic colour photographs of World War I memorials. The images serve to interrogate the place of memory in the contemporary landscape, By using a large format panoramic camera and a slow shutter speed Harrison shows the viewer the memorials in isolation as opposed to how we normally see them, i.e. in passing. This emphasises the act of looking and \\"the result is to give objects we hardly ever examine an ironic splendour.\\" \\"Sites of Memory\\" has continued to be exhibited extensively most notably, the Imperial War Museum, London, Deutsches Historisches Museum, Berlin. and in 2007 \\"Sites of Memory\\" was exhibited at the Tate Britain, London as part of an extensive survey of British Photography curated by Val Williams and Susan Bright, \\"How we are: Photographing Britain from the 1840s to the Present\\".

I Belong Jarrow In 2012 Harrison published his first monograph,\\"I Belong Jarrow\\"The series is reproduced within Harrison's site. about his hometown, Jarrow, England. In this, Harrison considers an understanding of the north and its place in photographic culture through memory and personal history. \\"I Belong Jarrow\\" consists of large format urban landscapes mixed with \\"an anarchic mixture of jokes, observations, and personal histories, he takes us to the heart of his own Jarra, and leaves us there to make of it what we will.\\" Photographs from the series \\"I belong Jarrow\\" have been exhibited in England and Europe, including the MACRO Testaccio, Rome. and the Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens, Sunderland, England. Copper Horses In 2012, Harrison was awarded the 16th Bradford Fellowship at the National Media Museum, Bradford, England. The Fellowship enabled mid-career photographers to develop their professional practice. Previous recipients included Paul Graham, David Hurn, Donovan Wylie and Sarah Jones. For the one year Fellowship Harrison photographed the boring machine his father had operated throughout his working life. \\"The result is a complex visual metaphor for his thoughts and feelings about his relationship with his father and the many people who work hard to make ends meet in British industry\\". The work, titled \\"Copper Horses\\"The series is reproduced here within Harrison's site. was exhibited at the National Media Museum in 2013. The title of the exhibition derives from the name given to a copper component for electrical substation produced by the workers in Jarrow. For the exhibition Copper Horses, Harrison produced a set of images which show some of his father's Tools and possessions (a set of Dominoes a Micrometer, a photograph of him when he was 16 and a champion swimmer) and the dismantled parts of the machine (Vertical and Horizontal boring machine) he operated, from the age of 15 years until retirement.

As of 2012 most of the students are French nationals. Accreditation By Swiss authorities LFZ's Kindergarten and primary education program (Primary School) as well as its lower secondary education program (Collège on the Sekundarstufe level) are approved by the bureau for elementary school (Volksschulamt), administration for education (Bildungsdirektion), canton of Zurich. However LFZ's upper secondary education program (Lycée) is neither approved as a Mittelschule by the bureau for gymnasial and vocational education (Mittelschul- und Berufsbildungsamt), administration of education (Bildungsdirektion), canton of Zurich, nor approved by the Swiss Federal State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI). By French authorities The Lycée Français Marie Curie de Zurich (LFZ) is one of 493 registered establishments, which form the network of French schools abroad. As such, it is approved by the French Minister of Education. This guarantees compliance with the French curriculum as well as the recognition of the choice of study pathways and the exams taken by the pupils. On the other hand, it depends upon the French Minister of Foreign Affairs and more specifically on the Agency for French Teaching Abroad (AEFE), in Paris. The Lycée Français Marie Curie de Zurich (LFZ) offers education from kindergarten (< 3 y.o.) to the baccalaureate exams, the official diploma accredited by the French minister of National Education. It is recognised for accessing institutes of higher education in France and in Europe as well as gaining a university education in Switzerland, on the basis of a successful French Baccalaureat, but not on the basis of a Swiss Matura. 3 series of General Baccalaureat: *Literature (L) *Social and Economic Sciences (ES) *Sciences (S) and possibility to choose a European Baccalaureat. History The Lycée Français Marie Curie de Zurich (LFZ) is an establishment in Switzerland that forms part of the Network for French Teaching Abroad (AEFE). Now more than fifty years old, it is experiencing a growth in appeal, currently schooling more than 750 pupils between 4 sites. Founded in 1956 by a group of parents, the French school taught its first class on the premises of the Catholic Mission on Hottingerstrasse. It then moved into a private property on Bergstrasse, where it stayed for twenty years. In 1980 it moved into its current premises, \\"im Tobelacker 22\\" in the village of Gockhausen, near the centre of Zurich. After decades of steady growth, due to Zurich’s increasing appeal as an attractive professional destination, the LFZ has not stopped growing. In 2003 the LFZ opened its doors on a second site and the Secondary school moved into the new building. Situated on Ursprungstrasse 10, in Gockhausen, it is not far from the Im Tobelacker site. With the ever-increasing number of pupils, the LFZ has been renting premises at Dübendorf-Stettbach to accommodate the nursery school since 2007. As of 1 September 2011, premises belonging to the training college \\"SAWI\\" in Dübendorf-Stettbach (Stettbacherstrasse 6) have been rented to accommodate the lycée students. At the start of term for the academic year 2015-16, the LFZ had students from over 400 families of French, Swiss and numerous other nationalities. Milestone : 2016 - 60th anniversary with opening of the new building \\"Nouveau LFZ 2016\\" that will gather the 4 sites in 1 in the Hochbord neighbourhood, Duebendorf. As of 2012 the school had about 760 students. In a period before that year, PSA Peugeot Citroën had established operations in the Zurich area, causing an increase in the LFZ's student body. Campuses The Ursprungstrasse 10 secondary school campus, serving collège (middle school) and lycée (senior high school) and housing the school administration, is located in Gockhausen, an area within Dübendorf; the primary school campus at Im Tobelacker 22 is also in that area.

History India opened its embassy in Mogadishu in 1961. The embassy was closed following the outbreak of the Somali Civil War in 1991. The High Commission of India in Nairobi, Kenya is jointly accredited to Somalia. Somalia maintains an embassy in New Delhi. Somali Prime Minister Abdirashid Ali Shermarke visited India in 1963. He visited the country again as president in 1968. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud visited New Delhi to attend the 3rd India Africa Forum Summit in October 2015. Mohamud was conferred an Honorary Doctorate degree by Barkatullah University during the visit. Several other high level Somali officials have also visited the country. From India, the highest level visits to Somalia have been at the level of minister of state. While a non-permanent member of the UNSC in 2011-12, India served as the chair of the UNSC's Somalia-Eritrea Sanctions Committee. Trade Trade between India and the Horn of Africa dates back to ancient times. Bilateral trade between India and Somalia totaled US$391.05 million in 2014-15, recording a growth of 51% over the previous fiscal. India exported $352.81 million worth of goods to Somalia, and imported. $38.25 million. Since 2008, India provides Somalia unilateral duty-free tariff preferential market access for export of goods and services. Foreign aid India provided worth of medicines and clothing to Somalia in 1961, and of relief supplies in 1992. India donated 100,000 tonnes of wheat to Somalia, Kenya, and Djibouti) in 1985. The Pan African e-Network project, India's flagship aid initiative in Africa, was inaugurated on 16 August 2010 in Somalia. India donated $2 million to the African Union Mission for Somalia (AMISOM) in May 2011, and an additional $1 million in March 2012. In September 2011, India provided $8 million to Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti through the WFP. Citizens of Somalia are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.  Anti-piracy operations  India is a member of the UN Contact Group on Piracy off the coast of Somalia. Since 2008, the Indian Navy has been conducting anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden. For the first time, the government authorised the Navy to act autonomously without requesting permission from New Delhi to carry out individual operations. A pirate \\"mother ship\\" fired upon an Indian warship on 26 November 2008, but was sunk after the warship returned fire. Around the same period, INS Tabar prevented the attempted hijacking of an Indian cargo ship off the coast of Somalia. Tabar was dispatched by the Navy in October 2008 to escort vessels off the coast of Somalia. The ship escorted over 35 Indian and foreign-owned ships by the end of November 2008. Following a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in October 2015, the two countries agreed to enhance their co-operation in maritime security and anti-piracy operations. Indian Navy personnel prepare to board the Al Kausar on 13 April 2017. An Indian-flagged cargo vessel called MV Al Kausar was hijacked by Somali pirates off the island of Socotra on 1 April 2017. The vessel was a dhow carrying wheat and sugar, and sailing from Dubai to Bosasso in Puntland, Somalia with 11 crew members on board. All crew members were Indian citizens. The pirates took the dhow onshore into the central Galmudug state of Somalia. Somali security forces raided the dhow which led to the pirates fleeing to the hilly areas between El-Hur and Hardheere with nine crew members as hostages. Somali forces rescued the dhow, its cargo and the two crew members who had been abandoned by the pirates amidst the clashes. A subsequent raid by Somali forces freed the remaining nine crew members, and all 10 pirates were captured. The pirates had planned to use the Indian hostages to demand the release of pirates being held in Indian prisons. The Indian Navy took possession of the dhow and its crew members on 13 April 2017. After conducting medical checks on crew members and re-supplying the vessel, a Navy ship escorted the Al Kausar to its scheduled destination. Somalis in India After the outbreak of the Somali Civil War in 1991, some Somalis sought asylum in India. This refugee community comprises the bulk of Somali immigrants in the country. As of 2007, there are an estimated 600 Somalis in India, 80-90% of whom are concentrated in the city of Hyderabad. Other cities with sizeable populations include Pune, New Delhi, Mumbai, Mysuru and Aurangabad.Human Rights Law Network: Report of Refugee Populations in India, November 2007 Somalis often visit India to study in the country or to seek medical attention. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud studied in India in the 1980s. Indians in Somalia Indian traders have engaged in trade with Somalis since ancient times. Arab traveller Ibn Battuta recorded the presence of Indian traders in the Horn of Africa as far back as 1331. Battuta wrote that the traders lived with their families in one or two storey buildings. By the 19th centuries, Indian traders in Somalia began exporting export livestock, meat, skins and agricultural products from southern Somalia. Italian plantation owners hired Indians to work on plantations in Somalia (mainly around Qoryoley) in the 1940s and 50s. Indians also established several businesses in the country. An estimated 200 Indian families resided in Somalia, primarily involved in cloth dying Mogadishu and Merka. The Indian community in Somalia primarily resided in cities and had their own schools and facilities. At the time, Somalis were primarily nomads who wandered the countryside. Indian families in Kismayo moved to Mogadishu in the early 1980s, and nearly the entire Indian community in Somalia left the country after the Somali Civil War began in 1991. Most of the Indians in Somalia relocated to Mombasa, Kenya. Following the civil war, all Indian-owned properties in Somalia were seized by armed militia. Peacekeepers Around 4,600 Indian troops participated in UNOSOM II in 1993-94. The Indian contingent of UNOSOM II, led by Brigadier M P Bhagat, included armour, helicopters and the Indian Navy, and was based in Baidoa. Twelve Indian soldiers were killed in operations in Somalia. Apart from peacekeeping operations, Indian troops also carried out humanitarian activities and reconstruction.

This Beaux-Arts mansion, designed by Carrère and Hastings in 1903 as a summer residence, is now the Monmouth University library. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 28, 1978. History Murry Guggenheim In 1903, Murry Guggenheim (1858–1939), son of Meyer Guggenheim, bought property in West Long Branch to build a summer residence for himself and his wife, Leonie. The Beaux-Arts architecture firm of Carrère and Hastings was hired to design the building. The firm had achieved prominence with the design for the New York Public Library in 1897. The mansion was started in 1903 and completed in 1905. An addition was built in 1967 on the north side that doubled the available space for the library. In 2003, the library underwent a second expansion, for $14 million, which increased its capacity by 100,000 books. Description The building is a two-story Beaux-Arts style mansion with curved side wings and Palladian arcades. The exterior is covered with white stucco. The interior features a grand corridor with Ionic columns. The design by Carrère and Hastings was honored with a Gold Medal by the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1903. It was styled after the Grand Trianon in Versailles. Legacy After the deaths of Murry and Leonie, the property transferred to the Murry and Leonie Guggenheim Foundation in 1959. The Foundation then transferred it to Monmouth College, now Monmouth University, in September 1960. After a year of modifications to convert the building into a college library, it was dedicated as the Murry and Leonie Guggenheim Memorial Library on September 24, 1961. The estate also included a nearby stable and carriage house at Cedar Avenue, which was donated to the college in 1961. It is now the Lauren K. Woods Theater.

It belongs to the Diocese of Lund. History and architecture According to the Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, there were once around 300 wooden churches in Scania, and while none of these survive, traces of a wooden stave church have been found in Hammarlöv Church. This first church was probably built during the later part of the 12th century, and quite probably to designs by a master builder known as Mårten stenmästare, i.e. \\"Martin the master stonemason\\". He was active at the construction of Lund Cathedral and several church building projects in Scania. The presently visible stone church was probably built at the end of the 12th or early 13th century in a Romanesque style, although it has been altered since. The church is one of only four in Scania to have a round tower, the others being Hammarlunda, Blentarp and Bollerup. The reason for this unusual design is unclear. According to one source, it most probably formed a part of the original design of the church and served a defensive purpose, aimed especially at defending the congregation against the Wends, who are known to have raided the southern coast of Scania at the time. However, according to another source the tower is too small to have served as a fortification. Instead, the church tower may have been erected as a funerary monument by a local nobleman (who may be the subject of a much-faded mural inside the church). He may have participated in the Crusades or gone on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and erected the tower as a symbol of his connection to Jerusalem. The church has been expanded several times, the last times being in 1800 and 1862. Inside, the church has a vaulted ceiling from the 15th century, decorated in the choir with murals. The choir is separated from the rest of the church by a chancel arch decorated with sculptures of lions. Among the church fittings, the baptismal font is the oldest, dating from the time of the construction of the church. The altarpiece is from 1700 and the pulpit from the 17th century. A side gallery is decorated with paintings depicting the virtues, made during the 17th century. The organ is from 1851 and rebuilt in 1926.

It stars Dianna Agron, Paz de la Huerta, Chris Zylka, and Louisa Krause. The film follows a young woman living in a small desert town in Nevada, who becomes romantically involved with a female drifter who leads her into a life of drugs, stripping, and psychedelic spiritual experiences. The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 19, 2015. IFC Films released it on October 30, 2015, in a limited release and through video on demand. Plot Sarah Barton lives in a small Nevada desert town with her mother and works as a cashier. After a co-worker's complaint causes her to lose her job, she meets Pepper, a drifter who has crashed at an antiques store owned by her family. Intrigued by Pepper, Sarah allows her to stay at the store until she can find a place to live somewhere else. Sarah begins hanging out with Pepper and becomes drawn into Pepper's partying lifestyle, to the annoyance of her boyfriend, Haden, who does not understand why she has so little time for him. Haden offers to get her a job where he works and to let her stay with him, but she declines both offers. On a trip to Reno, Sarah follows along as Pepper cons a gambler into giving them money to play blackjack. After celebrating their winnings, Pepper reveals that she works at a strip club, called the Blue Room, as a bartender. Sarah initially takes a job at a fast food restaurant but soon tries out for the strip club instead. The strippers laugh when Sarah suggests that Pepper is a bartender. One of the strippers gives Sarah a free sample of an unspecified drug (presumably cocaine), and Sarah goes out on the stage. After Sarah and Pepper ingest peyote in the desert, Pepper admits that stripping is addictive and difficult to stop, as the money is good. The two women promise each other that either will quit if the other does. The two then confess their mutual attraction to each other and have sex for the first time. Meanwhile, Haden and Sarah's other friends become worried about her, as she has kept her new life secret from them. Sarah breaks up with Haden, telling him that they have gone in separate directions. When the other strippers tell Sarah that Pepper has worked in the past as a recruiter and seduced other women, Sarah becomes worried that she has been used. Pepper first denies everything but admits she has worked in the past as a recruiter; she still denies that she intentionally recruited Sarah or used her. After they reconcile, Sarah insists on paying off Pepper's debts so they can run away together and start over somewhere else. However, an altercation breaks out at the strip club when a man accuses Pepper of not paying back the full debt. Sarah intercedes on Pepper's behalf, only to panic when she sees Haden and another friend about to enter the club. As she attempts to slip out unnoticed, Haden discovers her and berates her. A cop, drawn by the earlier disturbance, breaks up the scene and arrests Sarah for possession of a controlled substance when she accidentally drops several drugs. Outed as both a stripper and drug- user, Sarah at first attempts to return to her friends but finds them too judgmental. After offering to pay back her mother for bailing her out by working at the fast food restaurant she applied to in the first place, the two tearfully embrace. Sarah tells Pepper that she has become tired of the lifestyle and it can not continue, as it is counter to her values. In the final scene, Sarah is seen hitchhiking out of town by herself.

In continuum mechanics, Whitham's averaged Lagrangian method – or in short Whitham's method – is used to study the Lagrangian dynamics of slowly-varying wave trains in an inhomogeneous (moving) medium. The method is applicable to both linear and non-linear systems. As a direct consequence of the averaging used in the method, wave action is a conserved property of the wave motion. In contrast, the wave energy is not necessarily conserved, due to the exchange of energy with the mean motion. However the total energy, the sum of the energies in the wave motion and the mean motion, will be conserved for a time-invariant Lagrangian. Further, the averaged Lagrangian has a strong relation to the dispersion relation of the system. The method is due to Gerald Whitham, who developed it in the 1960s. It is for instance used in the modelling of surface gravity waves on fluid interfaces, and in plasma physics. Resulting equations for pure wave motion In case a Lagrangian formulation of a continuum mechanics system is available, the averaged Lagrangian methodology can be used to find approximations for the average dynamics of wave motion – and (eventually) for the interaction between the wave motion and the mean motion – assuming the envelope dynamics of the carrier waves is slowly varying. Phase averaging of the Lagrangian results in an averaged Lagrangian, which is always independent of the wave phase itself (but depends on slowly varying wave quantities like wave amplitude, frequency and wavenumber). By Noether's theorem, variation of the averaged Lagrangian mathcal{L} with respect to the invariant wave phase theta(boldsymbol{x},t) then gives rise to a conservation law:  }} This equation states the conservation of wave action – a generalization of the concept of an adiabatic invariant to continuum mechanics – with :mathcal{A} equiv -frac{partialmathcal{L}}{partial(partial_t theta)} = +frac{partialmathcal{L}}{partialomega} and boldsymbol{mathcal{B}} equiv -frac{partialmathcal{L}}{partial(boldsymbol{ abla}theta)} = -frac{partialmathcal{L}}{partialboldsymbol{k}} being the wave action mathcal{A} and wave action flux boldsymbol{mathcal{B}} respectively. Further boldsymbol{x} and t denote space and time respectively, while boldsymbol{ abla} is the gradient operator. The angular frequency omega(boldsymbol{x},t) and wavenumber boldsymbol{k}(boldsymbol{x},t) are defined as and both are assumed to be slowly varying. Due to this definition, omega(boldsymbol{x},t) and boldsymbol{k}(boldsymbol{x},t) have to satisfy the consistency relations: The first consistency equation is known as the conservation of wave crests, and the second states that the wavenumber field boldsymbol{k}(boldsymbol{x},t) is irrotational (i.e. has zero curl). Method The averaged Lagrangian approach applies to wave motion – possibly superposed on a mean motion – that can be described in a Lagrangian formulation. Using an ansatz on the form of the wave part of the motion, the Lagrangian is phase averaged. Since the Lagrangian is associated with the kinetic energy and potential energy of the motion, the oscillations contribute to the Lagrangian, although the mean value of the wave's oscillatory excursion is zero (or very small). The resulting averaged Lagrangian contains wave characteristics like the wavenumber, angular frequency and amplitude (or equivalently the wave's energy density or wave action). But the wave phase itself is absent due to the phase averaging. Consequently, through Noether's theorem, there is a conservation law called the conservation of wave action. Originally the averaged Lagrangian method was developed by Whitham for slowly- varying dispersive wave trains. Several extensions have been made, e.g. to interacting wave components, Hamiltonian mechanics, higher-order modulational effects, dissipation effects. Variational formulation The averaged Lagrangian method requires the existence of a Lagrangian describing the wave motion. For instance for a field varphi(boldsymbol{x},t), described by a Lagrangian density Lleft(partial_tvarphi,boldsymbol{ abla}varphi,varphiright), the principle of stationary action is: : delta left( int, iiint, Lleft( partial_tvarphi(boldsymbol{x},t), boldsymbol{ abla}varphi(boldsymbol{x},t), varphi(boldsymbol{x},t) right), text{d}boldsymbol{x}, text{d}t right) = 0, with boldsymbol{ abla} the gradient operator and partial_t the time derivative operator. This action principle results in the Euler–Lagrange equation: : partial_t left( frac{partial L}{partial left( partial_t varphi right)} right) +boldsymbol{ abla} cdot left( frac{partial L}{partial left( boldsymbol{ abla} varphi right)} right)  frac{partial L}{partial varphi} = 0, which is the second-order partial differential equation describing the dynamics of varphi. Higher-order partial differential equations require the inclusion of higher than first-order derivatives in the Lagrangian. ; Example For example, consider a non-dimensional and non-linear Klein–Gordon equation in one space dimension x: This Euler–Lagrange equation emerges from the Lagrangian density: The small-amplitude approximation for the Sine–Gordon equation corresponds with the value sigma = -tfrac{1}{24}. For sigma=0 the system is linear and the classical one-dimensional Klein–Gordon equation is obtained. Slowly-varying waves  =Slowly-varying linear waves= Whitham developed several approaches to obtain an averaged Lagrangian method. The simplest one is for slowly-varying linear wavetrains, which method will be applied here. The slowly-varying wavetrain – without mean motion – in a linear dispersive system is described as: : varphi sim Releft{ A(boldsymbol{x},t), text{e}^{itheta(boldsymbol{x},t)} right} = a(boldsymbol{x},t), cos left( theta(boldsymbol{x},t) + alpha right), with a = left A right and alpha = argleft{ A right}, where theta(boldsymbol{x},t) is the real-valued wave phase, A denotes the absolute value of the complex-valued amplitude A(boldsymbol{x},t), while arg{A} is its argument and Re{A} denotes its real part. The real-valued amplitude and phase shift are denoted by a and alpha respectively. Now, by definition, the angular frequency omega and wavenumber vector boldsymbol{k} are expressed as the time derivative and gradient of the wave phase theta(boldsymbol{x},t) as: :omega equiv -partial_t theta, and boldsymbol{k} equiv +boldsymbol{ abla} theta., As a consequence, omega(boldsymbol{x},t) and boldsymbol{k}(boldsymbol{x},t) have to satisfy the consistency relations: :partial_t boldsymbol{k} + boldsymbol{ abla} omega = boldsymbol{0} and boldsymbol{ abla} times boldsymbol{k}=boldsymbol{0}. These two consistency relations denote the \\"conservation of wave crests\\", and the irrotationality of the wavenumber field. Because of the assumption of slow variations in the wave train – as well as in a possible inhomogeneous medium and mean motion – the quantities A, a, omega, boldsymbol{k} and alpha all vary slowly in space boldsymbol{x} and time t – but the wave phase theta itself does not vary slowly. Consequently, derivatives of a, omega, boldsymbol{k} and alpha are neglected in the determination of the derivatives of varphi(boldsymbol{x},t) for use in the averaged Lagrangian: :partial_tvarphi approx +omega, a, sin (theta+alpha) and boldsymbol{ abla}varphi approx -boldsymbol{k}, a, sin (theta + alpha). Next these assumptions on varphi(boldsymbol{x},t) and its derivatives are applied to the Lagrangian density Lleft(partial_tvarphi,boldsymbol{ abla}varphi,varphiright). =Slowly-varying non-linear waves= Several approaches to slowly-varying non-linear wavetrains are possible. One is by the use of Stokes expansions, used by Whitham to analyse slowly-varying Stokes waves. A Stokes expansion of the field varphi(boldsymbol{x},t) can be written as: :varphi = a, cos left( theta + alpha right) + a_2, cos left( 2 theta + alpha_2 right) + a_3, cos left( 3 theta + alpha_3 right) + cdots, where the amplitudes a, a_2, etc. are slowly varying, as are the phases alpha, alpha_2, etc. As for the linear wave case, in lowest order (as far as modulational effects are concerned) derivatives of amplitudes and phases are neglected, except for derivatives omega and boldsymbol{k} of the fast phase theta: :partial_t varphi approx +omega a, sin left( theta + alpha right) + 2omega a_2, sin left( 2 theta + alpha_2 right) + 3omega a_3, sin left( 3 theta + alpha_3 right) + cdots, and :boldsymbol{ abla} varphi approx -boldsymbol{k} a, sin left( theta + alpha right) - 2boldsymbol{k} a_2, sin left( 2 theta + alpha_2 right) - 3boldsymbol{k} a_3, sin left( 3 theta + alpha_3 right) + cdots. These approximations are to be applied in the Lagrangian density L, and its phase average overline{L}. Averaged Lagrangian for slowly-varying waves For pure wave motion the Lagrangian Lleft(partial_tvarphi,boldsymbol{ abla}varphi,varphiright) is expressed in terms of the field varphi(boldsymbol{x},t) and its derivatives. In the averaged Lagrangian method, the above-given assumptions on the field varphi(boldsymbol{x},t) – and its derivatives – are applied to calculate the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is thereafter averaged over the wave phase theta: : overline{L} = frac{1}{2pi} int_0^{2pi} Lleft(partial_tvarphi,boldsymbol{ abla}varphi,varphiright); text{d}theta. As a last step, this averaging result overline{L} can be expressed as the averaged Lagrangian density mathcal{L}(omega,boldsymbol{k},a) – which is a function of the slowly varying parameters omega, boldsymbol{k} and a and independent of the wave phase theta itself. The averaged Lagrangian density mathcal{L} is now proposed by Whitham to follow the average variational principle: From the variations of mathcal{L} follow the dynamical equations for the slowly- varying wave properties. ; Example Continuing on the example of the nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation, see equations and , and applying the above approximations for varphi, partial_t varphi and partial_x varphi (for this 1D example) in the Lagrangian density, the result after averaging over theta is: : overline{L} = tfrac14 (omega^2 - k^2 - 1 ) a^2 - tfrac{3}{32} sigma a^4 + (omega^2 - k^2 - tfrac14) a_2^2 + mathcal{O}(a^6), where it has been assumed that, in big-O notation, a_2=mathcal{O}(a^2) and a_3=mathcal{O}(a^3). Variation of overline{L} with respect to a_2 leads to a_2=0. So the averaged Lagrangian is: For linear wave motion the averaged Lagrangian is obtained by setting sigma equal to zero. Set of equations emerging from the averaged Lagrangian Applying the averaged Lagrangian principle, variation with respect to the wave phase theta leads to the conservation of wave action: : partial_t left( + frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial omega} right) + boldsymbol{ abla} cdot left( - frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial boldsymbol{k}} right) = 0, since omega=-partial_ttheta and boldsymbol{k}=boldsymbol{ abla}theta while the wave phase theta does not appear in the averaged Lagrangian density mathcal{L} due to the phase averaging. Defining the wave action as mathcal{A}equiv+partialmathcal{L}/partialomega and the wave action flux as boldsymbol{mathcal{B}}equiv-partialmathcal{L}/partialboldsymbol{k} the result is: :partial_t mathcal{A} + boldsymbol{ abla} cdot boldsymbol{mathcal{B}} = 0. The wave action equation is accompanied with the consistency equations for omega and boldsymbol{k} which are: :partial_t boldsymbol{k} + boldsymbol{ abla} omega = boldsymbol{0} and boldsymbol{ abla} times boldsymbol{k} = boldsymbol{0}. Variation with respect to the amplitude a leads to the dispersion relation partialmathcal{L}/partial a=0. ; Example Continuing with the nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation, using the average variational principle on equation , the wave action equation becomes by variation with respect to the wave phase theta: : partial_t left( tfrac12 omega a^2 right) + partial_x left( tfrac12 k a^2 right) = 0, and the nonlinear dispersion relation follows from variation with respect to the amplitude a: :omega^2 = k^2 + 1 + tfrac34 sigma a^2. So the wave action is mathcal{A}=tfrac12 omega a^2 and the wave action flux mathcal{B}=tfrac12 k a^2. The group velocity v_g is v_gequivmathcal{B}/mathcal{A}=k/omega. Mean motion and pseudo-phase Conservation of wave action The averaged Lagrangian is obtained by integration of the Lagrangian over the wave phase. As a result, the averaged Lagrangian only contains the derivatives of the wave phase theta (these derivatives being, by definition, the angular frequency and wavenumber) and does not depend on the wave phase itself. So the solutions will be independent of the choice of the zero level for the wave phase. Consequently – by Noether's theorem – variation of the averaged Lagrangian overline{mathcal{L}} with respect to the wave phase results in a conservation law: = 0, }} where :displaystyle mathcal{A}equivfrac{delta overline{mathcal{L}}}{delta omega} = -frac{delta overline{mathcal{L}}}{delta left( partial_t theta right)} and displaystyle boldsymbol{mathcal{B}}equiv-frac{delta overline{mathcal{L}}}{delta boldsymbol{k}} = -frac{delta overline{mathcal{L}}}{delta left( boldsymbol{ abla} theta right)}, with mathcal{A} the wave action and boldsymbol{mathcal{B}} the wave action flux. Further partial_t denotes the partial derivative with respect to time, and boldsymbol{ abla} is the gradient operator. By definition, the group velocity boldsymbol{v}_g is given by: :boldsymbol{mathcal{B}} equiv boldsymbol{v}_g mathcal{A}., Note that in general the energy of the wave motion does not need to be conserved, since there can be an energy exchange with a mean flow. The total energy – the sum of the energies of the wave motion and the mean flow – is conserved (when there is no work by external forces and no energy dissipation). Conservation of wave action is also found by applying the generalized Lagrangian mean (GLM) method to the equations of the combined flow of waves and mean motion, using Newtonian mechanics instead of a variational approach. Conservation of energy and momentum Connection to the dispersion relation Pure wave motion by linear models always leads to an averaged Lagrangian density of the form: :mathcal{L} = G(omega,boldsymbol{k}) a^2. Consequently, the variation with respect to amplitude: partial mathcal{L}/partial a =0 gives :G(omega,boldsymbol{k})=0. So this turns out to be the dispersion relation for the linear waves, and the averaged Lagrangian for linear waves is always the dispersion function G(omega,boldsymbol{k}) times the amplitude squared. More generally, for weakly nonlinear and slowly modulated waves propagating in one space dimension and including higher-order dispersion effects – not neglecting the time and space derivatives partial_t a and partial_x a of the amplitude a(mu x,mu t) when taking derivatives, where mull 1 is a small modulation parameter – the averaged Lagrangian density is of the form: :mathcal{L}= G(omega,k) a^2 + G_2(omega,k) a^4 + tfrac12 mu^2 left( G_{omegaomega} (partial_T a)^2 + 2 G_{omega k} (partial_T a) (partial_X a) + G_{kk} (partial_X a)^2 right), with the slow variables X=mu x and T=mu t.

Background Ryder was born in 1838, the son of George Dudley Ryder (1810–1880) by Sophia Lucy Sargent (d. 1850), daughter of Rev. John Sargent. His grandfather was Rev. the Hon. Henry Ryder, Bishop of Lichfield, who was himself the fifth son of the 1st Baron Harrowby. His brother was the Very Reverend Henry Ignatius Dudley Ryder (1837-1907) who became a Roman Catholic priest. His maternal aunts (Sargent sisters) were married to Samuel Wilberforce, Henry Wilberforce, and Henry Edward Manning. Career Ryder entered the Treasury in 1857, and became Principal Clerk in 1882, and Auditor of the Civil list in 1895. He was appointed Chairman of the Board of Customs in February 1899, and served as such until December 1903. The following year, he was a member of Austen Chamberlain's Tariff Reform Commission. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1889 Birthday Honours list in May 1889, and promoted to Knight Companion (KCB) of the order in the 1901 Birthday Honours list in November 1901. He was knighted and received the insignia of the order from King Edward VII on 17 December 1901. Family Ryder married, in 1882, his first cousin Edith Helena Ryder (1845–1921), daughter of Rev. Henry Dudley Ryder (1803–1877), Canon of Lichfield, by his second wife Eliza Julia Tucker (d.1897). Lady Ryder was elected a Fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1902. He died at his residence in Kensington on 30 June 1905. Lady Ryder died in 1921.

They allow user-level as well as operating system code to define private regions of memory, called enclaves, whose contents are protected and unable to be either read or saved by any process outside the enclave itself, including processes running at higher privilege levels. SGX involves encryption by the CPU of a portion of memory. The enclave is decrypted on the fly only within the CPU itself, and even then, only for code and data running from within the enclave itself. The processor thus protects the code from being \\"spied on\\" or examined by other code. The code and data in the enclave utilize a threat model in which the enclave is trusted but no process outside it can be trusted (including the operating system itself and any hypervisor), and therefore all of these are treated as potentially hostile. The enclave contents are unable to be read by any code outside the enclave, other than in its encrypted form.. Applications running inside of SGX must be written to be side channel resistant as SGX does not protect against side channel measurement or observation. SGX is designed to be useful for implementing secure remote computation, secure web browsing, and digital rights management (DRM). Other applications include concealment of proprietary algorithms and of encryption keys. Details SGX was first introduced in 2015 with the sixth generation Intel Core microprocessors based on the Skylake microarchitecture. Support for SGX in the CPU is indicated in CPUID \\"Structured Extended feature Leaf\\", EBX bit 02,Intel Architecture Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference, Intel, AUGUST 2015, page 36 \\"Structured Extended feature Leaf EAX=07h, EBX Bit 02: SGX\\" but its availability to applications requires BIOS/UEFI support and opt-in enabling which is not reflected in CPUID bits. This complicates the feature detection logic for applications. Emulation of SGX was added to an experimental version of the QEMU system emulator in 2014. In 2015, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology released an open-source simulator named \\"OpenSGX\\". One example of SGX used in security was a demo application from wolfSSL using it for cryptography algorithms. Intel Goldmont Plus (Gemini Lake) microarchitecture also contains support for Intel SGX.  Attacks  Prime+Probe attack On 27 March 2017 researchers at Austria's Graz University of Technology developed a proof-of-concept that can grab RSA keys from SGX enclaves running on the same system within five minutes by using certain CPU instructions in lieu of a fine-grained timer to exploit cache DRAM side-channels. One countermeasure for this type of attack was presented and published by Daniel Gruss et al. at the USENIX Security Symposium in 2017. Among other published countermeasures, one countermeasure to this type of attack was published on September 28, 2017, a compiler-based tool, DR.SGX, that claims to have superior performance with the elimination of the implementation complexity of other proposed solutions. Spectre-like attack The LSDS group at Imperial College London showed a proof of concept that the Spectre speculative execution security vulnerability can be adapted to attack the secure enclave. The Foreshadow attack, disclosed in August 2018, combines speculative execution and buffer overflow to bypass the SGX.  Enclave attack  On 8 February 2019, researchers at Austria's Graz University of Technology published findings, which showed that in some cases it is possible to run malicious code from within the enclave itself. The exploit involves scanning through process memory, in order to reconstruct a payload, which can then run code on the system. The paper claims that due to the confidential and protected nature of the enclave, it is impossible for Antivirus software to detect and remove malware residing within it. However, since modern anti-malware and antivirus solutions monitor system calls, and the interaction of the application with the operating system, it should be possible to identify malicious enclaves by their behavior, and this issue is unlikely to be a concern for state-of-the-art antiviruses. Intel issued a statement, stating that this attack was outside the threat model of SGX, that they cannot guarantee that code run by the user comes from trusted sources, and urged consumers to only run trusted code.  MicroScope replay attack  There is a proliferation of Side-channel attack plaguing modern computer architecture. Many of these attacks measure slight, nondeterministic variations in the execution of some code, so the attacker needs many, possibly tens of thousands, of measurements to learn secrets. However, the Microscope attack allows a malicious OS to replay code an arbitrary number of times regardless of the programs actual structure, enabling dozens of side-channel attacks.  Plundervolt  Security researchers were able to inject timing specific faults into execution within the enclave, resulting in leakage of information. The attack can be executed remotely, but requires access to the privileged control of the processor's voltage and frequency.  LVI  Load Value Injection injects data into a program aiming to replace the value loaded from memory which is then used for a short time before the mistake is spotted and rolled back, during which LVI controls data and control flow.  SGAxe  SGAxe, a SGX vulnerability, extends a speculative execution attack on cache , leaking content of the enclave. This allows an attacker to access private CPU keys used for remote attestation. In other words, a threat actor can bypass Intel's countermeasures to breach SGX's enclaves confidentiality. The SGAxe attack is carried out by extracting attestation keys from SGX's private quoting enclave, that are signed by Intel. The attacker can then masquerade as legitimate Intel machines by signing arbitrary SGX attestation quotes.

It was opened in 1895, having been sold while incomplete to the Caledonian Railway. The hopes to become a main line were never realised and it remained a purely local concern. Its low traffic volumes led to early closure to passengers in 1952 and completely in 1967. History Early railways The earliest railways in Angus were technologically primitive lines constructed in the 1830s: the Dundee and Newtyle Railway (opened 1831), the Dundee and Arbroath Railway (1838) and the Arbroath and Forfar Railway (1838). The used stone block sleepers and their track gauge was selected with obvious disregard of connecting to other lines further afield. Their focus was connecting harbours on the Firth of Tay with the agricultural hinterland. A Scottish network System map of the Forfar and Brechin RailwayIn the 1840s serious consideration was given to the connection of central Scotland to London, and considerable public controversy took place over the optimal route, as it was assumed at first that only one line could be supported. The public debate encouraged consideration of a Scottish railway network, and the availability of easy money led to a considerable number of schemes being presented to Parliament for the 1845 session. Prime among these was the Caledonian Railway, with capital of £1.5 million, to build from Edinburgh and Glasgow to Carlisle. Several other Scottish lines were authorised on the same day, 31 July 1845, including the Scottish Central Railway, to build from Castlecary to Perth, the Scottish Midland Junction Railway, to build from Perth to Forfar, and the Scottish Midland Junction Railway, to build from Perth to Forfar. The last link in this particular chain was the Aberdeen Railway. The Aberdeen Railway The Aberdeen Railway was to build northward from a location between Arbroath and Forfar, to Aberdeen. It was to take over, and modernise, the primitive Arbroath and Forfar line. The A&FR; line lay across the general line of advance, and the Aberdeen Railway had two choices: to build from Forfar via Brechin, or to build from the A&FR; line somewhere closer to Arbroath. Brechin was a significant township at the time, with a population in 1841 of about 4,000. However the decision was taken to make a junction with the A&FR; near Guthrie instead; this prevented the selection of a route through Brechin, but avoided a considerable mileage of new construction. The Aberdeen Railway opened in stages between 1847 and 1850. Brechin was served by a branch line from Bridge of Dun. The Forfar and Brechin Railway proposed The route via Brechin considered for the Aberdeen Railway was revived in the 1880s, when a main line railway was under consideration from Forfar to Brechin: the earlier proposal was renewed. The Forfar and Brechin Railway was proposed as an alternative main line route, avoiding the detour via Guthrie, somewhat shortening the mileage between Perth and Aberdeen. There were some practical difficulties with this scheme: the Hills of Finhaven formed a long ridge north of Forfar, which meant that the direct line to Brechin would have to diverge some considerable distance west of the existing Forfar station, and through trains would be unable to make a call: Forfar would be on a branch. Moreover, the terminal station at Brechin faced the centre of the town and could not be converted to a through station. Attempts were made to find an acceptable alternative site for stations at both the towns which would enable the operation of a through main line, but in both cases this proved impossible. The Caledonian was being urged by the F&BR; to adopt its scheme as the main line, saving eight miles (12 km) in the main line, but the gradients would be 1 in 80 and both Forfar and Brechin would be off the new main line: the Caledonian were unenthusiastic. Undeterred, promoters submitted a Bill to the 1890 Parliamentary session, and the Forfar and Brechin Railway was authorised on 4 August 1890, capital £160,000.From Carter; Ross says £330,000, page 144, but this is double the price they paid to purchase it in 1893. The main line was to be 13 miles (20 km) long, with two short connections in Forfar, which were to form the spur connections to the Forfar station. (The railway as built only ran from Forfar station in a westerly direction, curving north and east to the originally planned main line.) Although still conceived as a through trunk railway, it started from Forfar heading west (involving a reversal there for through trains). There was worse: at Brechin, the proposed alignment passed by the Brechin station, and had no station facility in this, the most important community on its route. It was to converge with the existing Aberdeen Railway line somewhat to the east of its Brechin station. Complications The construction of the Forfar and Brechin line proceeded, and it was complete by early 1894, and by the middle of the year had been successfully inspected by the Board of Trade inspecting officer. However, there were now complications with the neighbouring Brechin and Edzell District Railway. The Edzell line had obtained authorisation concurrently with the Forfar line, but the alignment of the two lines approaching Brechin had not been co-ordinated; moreover there were still moves to provide a suitable station at Brechin for the Edzell line, and this had the effect of delaying the completion of the Forfar line. The Brechin and Edzell company had to get an Act of Parliament altering their proposed route to make it compatible with the F&BR; line: the result was the Brechin and Edzell Railway Amendment Act 1893, which also permitted them to use the Caledonian Railway (as successor to the Aberdeen Railway) station in Brechin, instead of the independent terminus they had originally intended, and the Act also permitted the F&BR; line to use that station. Sale to the Caledonian Railway The F&BR; had considered itself to be a main line trunk railway but in fact it was becoming a purely local rural line, with no large population centre on its line of route. Raising money for the construction must have been a problem, for on 29 Nov 1893, Joseph Phillips, the contractor for the construction of the line, on behalf of himself and the company sold the line to the Caledonian Railway for £168,400. The fact that Phillips was in the lead means that he was the majority shareholder, so the company must have paid him for his work in shares. The sale was authorised by an Act of 31 July 1894. Opening All the formalities having finally been completed, the line opened to goods trains on 7 January 1895 and to passenger trains on 1 June 1895. The line was worked by the Caledonian from the outset. The train service was purely local, running to the Brechin terminus station, and the through line, passing Brechin was never used for passenger trains. Indeed, the junction at the east end of the loop connection was controlled from a ground frame only. The passenger service consisted of four or five trains daily. Decline and closure The F&BR; never achieved the main line status that its promoters had imagined: its departure from Forfar meant a reversal there, and a station call at Brechin also meant a reversal. Never reaching its potential the line closed to passenger trains on 4 August 1952. Goods trains continued to run throughout until on 17 March 1958 the line was closed completely between Careston and Brechin; it was further cut back to only Forfar to Justinhaugh from 7 September 1964, and completely closed on 4 September 1967. Topography At Brechin the line as authorised passed west to east on the north side of the town. After the 1893 Act modifying the Edzell line, the two lines joined on the north west side of the town and ran for a while alongside one another, as two single lines, to Brechin North Junction; from there the two lines combined and ran as a double line round to Brechin terminal station. The F&BR; line continued eastwards to Brechin East Junction; this was a ground frame controlled connection only. Passenger operation on the Forfar and Brechin line was from 1 June 1895 to 4 August 1952.

Founded in 1971, the association organizes cultural and political events for residents of Northwestern United States and British Columbia. Traditionally, the association participates in local and international cultural events and sponsors annual regional celebrations of Independence Day of Ukraine and the anniversary of the birth of the famous Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko. The association maintains relations with Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, with Ukrainian Embassy and Consulate, with Ukrainian diaspora in Canada, with Ukrainian churches of various denominations, and with other regional ethnic organizations. According to different estimates, the association represents from 55,000 to 100,000 Americans of Ukrainian origin.  History   1970s  Original application to the club Wes Uhlman, in the presence of the club's delegation, January 1976. The Ukrainian Association of Washington State was founded in Seattle on September 27, 1971 initially under the name Ukrainian American Club of Washington. The club's founder and its first president was an immigrant from Ukraine, Wolodymyr Klos. In the beginning of the 1970s, the club initiated a number of cultural and political events that became annual traditions. The first official event sponsored by the club was a Ukrainian Christmas celebration at the Museum of History and Industry in December 1971. Club members introduced Ukrainian Christmas traditions to the audience, and the club's choir sang Ukrainian Christmas carols. The museum also opened an exhibit of Ukrainian arts and crafts. In the 1970s, similar Christmas events were regularly organized by the club. Since 1972 the club has also celebrated the birthday of Taras Shevchenko, a famous Ukrainian poet. In 1972, the first grand ceremony took place at St. James Cathedral. In 1973, the club held its first political activity by commemorating Ukrainian independence. In 1973, Ukraine was still incorporated into the Soviet Union, and Ukrainian diaspora traditionally recognized January 22 as Ukrainian Independence day. On this day in 1918, Central Council of Ukraine has adopted its IV Universal proclaiming Ukrainian independence; however, Ukraine was subsequently overrun with Bolshevik armies and incorporated into the Soviet Union. In 1973 the event hosted hundreds of guests from the northwestern US and British Columbia. Proclamations in support of Ukrainian independence were signed by the governor of Washington Daniel Evans and Seattle mayor Wes Uhlman who delivered a speech during the event. In 1975, the club-sponsored the \\"Ukrainian Northwest Festival\\" in support of Ukrainian independence. Over 3500 guests from US and Canada attended the festival which featured Ukrainian artists, musicians, and dancers. Former Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and a number of US senators and congressional representatives sent their greeting messages to the festival's attendees. In 1976 in addition to its regular activities attended by thousands, the club participated in the celebrations of United States Bicentennial and organized a special exhibition of Ukrainian folk art associated with the event.  1980s  In the 1980s, the club has continued its tradition of commemorating Independence Day of Ukraine and has organized proclamations in support of Ukrainian independence signed by Washington governors Dixy Lee Ray and Booth Gardner as well as by Seattle mayor Charles Royer. In September 1982, the club organized protests in support of the Reagan administration’s policy against the construction of the Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhgorod pipeline through Soviet Ukraine. The Reagan administration believed that such a project would make Europe dangerously dependent on Russian gas. Protests took place in Gas Works Park and were also supported by Americans of Eastern European origins.  1990s  For Ukrainian diaspora, the most important event of the nineties was the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine of 1991 when Ukraine achieved true independence as the result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This event has triggered strong emotional reaction within the local diaspora. The club's original founder, Wolodymyr Klos, returned to Ukraine. The club started raising money for the newly formed state of Ukraine including assistance to the victims of the Chernobyl disaster. In 1991, all club events related to the Ukrainian independence were moved from January 22 (the anniversary of IV Universal by Central Council of Ukraine) to August 24 – the current official Independence Day of Ukraine. Since 1991, the composition of Ukrainian diaspora of Washington State began to change. Most of the early club members immigrated to the United States from Halychyna after World War II fleeing Stalin's terror. These immigrants were exclusively native Ukrainian speakers and were largely parishioners of Ukrainian Orthodox Churches or of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. After 1991, newcomers to Washington State came from a variety of Ukrainian regions, and among those, the majority of churchgoers were Evangelical Protestants. As the result, Ukrainian diaspora of Washington State became more heterogeneous, and the club activities became unconnected to any particular Ukrainian church.  21st century  US congressman Jim McDermott speaks at the event commemorating Holodomor, Seattle, 2008 Rally in support of Orange Revolution, Seattle, 2004 Rally in support of Euromaidan, Seattle, 2014 In 2008, the association took part in the worldwide «Holodomor Remembrance Flame» event commemorating the 75th anniversary of Holodomor. After its journey through Australia and Canada, the torch entered the United States in Seattle where it was solemnly passed to the Ukrainian ambassador in US. The association has sponsored the event and the subsequent reception which was attended by officials from Ukraine, United States, and Canada. The most important events in the 21st century that affected the life of the association were the Orange Revolution of 2004 and Euromaidan with subsequent Impeachment of Viktor Yanukovych followed by 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. These events have triggered mass protests in Ukraine, especially on Maidan Nezalezhnosti in Kiev as well as protests within all Ukrainian diaspora. In 2004, widespread falsification of the results of Ukrainian presidential election in favor of a pro-Russian candidate Victor Yanukovych has led to a political crisis and a series of civil disobedience actions that were dubbed «Orange Revolution». These events have led to a repeat vote that secured a victory for Yanukovich's rival, Viktor Yushchenko. The association took part in the protests supporting Orange Revolution and promoted fair and transparent election procedures. The association solicited the Ukrainian administration for the opportunity of Washington State Ukrainians who still kept their Ukrainian citizenship (est. 15,000 people) to vote in this election. For the initial vote, the Ukrainian embassy has declined the association's petition to open a polling place in Seattle area, and Ukrainian consulate in San Francisco located over 800 miles from Seattle remained the closest polling place available to local Ukrainians. The association has helped to organize a bus convoy from Seattle to San Francisco so that at least some of the enfranchised Ukrainians could cast their votes. During the repeat vote, the association has compelled the Ukrainian Embassy to open a polling place in Kent, Washington which was the only such concession made by the Ukrainian government during the presidential elections of 2004. In 2014, the association supported mass protests in Ukraine against the abrupt decision of the Ukrainian government to discontinue the integration of Ukraine into the European Union. Rallies in support of Euromaidan were held in Seattle. The subsequent aggravation of the crisis, including the Impeachment of Viktor Yanukovych, the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, and followed 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, has sparked new waves of protests among local Ukrainians. The association was raising money to support protesters in Ukraine, took part in the reception in Seattle of Ukrainian families whose members were killed in the conflict, and organized regional rallies and protests.

The association traditionally celebrates anniversaries of birth of Taras Shevchenko, participates in regional Christmas festival, represents Ukrainian culture on Northwest Folklife Festival and other festivals in US and Canada. From 2004, The association sponsors folk dance group «Barvinok» which participated and won multiple awards on international Ukrainian festivals in Ukrainian dance category. For example, in 2010 on Ukrainian festival in Canada, «Barvinok» won 4 gold and 2 silver medals. In 1973, the association has organized Ukrainian language courses in the University of Washington. The association continues to sponsor Ukrainian Studies in the university. In addition, the association sponsors Ukrainian languages classes for children and offers emergency language support in the region. The association organizes concerts of Ukrainian artists in Seattle area. Among these artists who performed in Seattle were Vasyl Nechepa, Vasyl Shkliar, and Anastasia Prikhodko. Even though, during the last 15 years, Ukrainian diaspora became culturally heterogeneous, the association activists see these developments as an opportunity to expand and amplify Ukrainian cultural heritage. { style=\\"border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\\" + Cultural events sponsored by the association  280px   266px - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  style=\\"width:290px\\" Performance of Taras Shevchenko's play Nazar Stodolya in Renton theater, 2014  style=\\"width:262px\\" «Barvinok» junior class performance on Ukrainian festival in Canada, 2010  style=\\"width:276px\\" «Barvinok» senior class performance on Northwest Folklife Festival, 2013 }  Political activities  The association has begun its political activities with the events that commemorated the proclamation of Ukrainian independence on January 22, 1918. In the northwestern United States, the first such event took place in Seattle in 1973. Prior to Ukraine genuine independence obtained in 1991, the association inspired various American officials to sign proclamations in support of Ukrainian independence. Among officials who signed these proclamations were Seattle mayors Wes Uhlman and Charles Royer as well as Governors of Washington Daniel J. Evans, Dixy Lee Ray, and Booth Gardner. { style=\\"border-spacing: 2px; background: #f0f0f0; border: 1px solid darkgray;\\" + Proclamations in support of Ukrainian Independence inspired by the association  168px  154px  165px  154px  166px - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  style=\\"width:178px\\" signed by Wesley C.

In 1973, the representatives of the association took part in Western GOP Conference, where Wolodymyr Klos asked US vice-president Gerald Ford to continue US opposition towards the Russification of Ukraine and towards the persecution of Ukrainian activists in Soviet Ukraine. The association repeatedly fought for freedom of political prisoners of Ukrainian origin. One of the first examples of such actions was the rally near Soviet Technical Exhibition in Seattle in May 1976 that was jointly organized with local Jewish community. The protesters demanded freedom for Ukrainian journalist Viacheslav Chornovil and for Jewish artist Boris Penson who were arrested in USSR. By means of multiple written communications to American Representatives of Congress and during the personal meeting with US First Lady Betty Ford on October 8, 1976, the members of the association solicited for freedom for Ukrainian historian Valentyn Moroz. 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine compelled many UAWS members to engage in political activities. In 2014, the association formed a political committee. The committee regularly organizes protest rallies in Seattle which call to stop Russian aggression, to free Nadiya Savchenko, to persecute the murderers of Boris Nemtsov, a member of Russian opposition and the notorious critic of Russian military intervention into Ukraine. Sometimes these rallies are joined by Russian local activists who also protest against Putin's policies. The association raises money for humanitarian aid and first-aid kits for Ukrainian soldiers injured during the conflict, for support of an independent Ukrainian TV channel Hromadske.tv, etc. The association is believed to be in the top 20 politically active Ukrainian organizations in United States.  Charitable activities  The association regularly raises money for a number of charitable causes including support of regional cultural events and support of different organizations in Ukraine. For example, the association raised money for victims of the Chernobyl disaster, for Euromaidan protesters in Kiev, for families of soldiers who died during 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine and for others. The association supports the endowments of Ukrainian Studies departments in US and in Ukraine. Among the beneficiaries are National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, Harvard University, the University of Washington, Seattle Pacific University and others.

Overview City of Preston showing the course of Savick Brook The Ribble Link along the course of Savick Brook The brook is a tributary of the lower Ribble, with its source on the outskirts of Longridge (around ), approximately to the northeast of Preston. It flows westward though the suburb of Fulwood towards and to the south of the village of Lea, where it makes a sharp turn to the south. It then continues on a southerly course and enters the Ribble from the north bank (at ) approximately west of the tidal basin that marks the entrance to Preston Dock. Geology Most of the underlying geology for the brook's water basin is Triassic rock consisting of red Sherwood sandstone, with a faulted boundary with the carboniferous rocks to the east of Preston. The upper part of Savick Brook around Longridge lies in a carboniferous area of Millstone Grit. Glacial drift deposits, principally till (boulder clay) also cover much of the area. Tributaries A number of smaller waterways flow into the brook, including: * Deepdale Brook * Eaves Brook * Sandy Brook * Sharoe Brook Ribble Link Savick Brook navigation weir; Ribble Link, near Lea In December 2000 construction began to turn a section of the brook west of Cottom Mill bridge into a navigation canal as part of the Ribble Link, a scheme to connect the previously isolated Lancaster Canal to the River Ribble. Opened in July 2002, the Link has a series of nine locks to allow small craft and narrowboats up to in length and in width to transit between the two waterways. Water Level and Quality There are a number of monitoring stations along the brook which measures its water level and at which samples are taken to determine water quality: Level At the Savick Brook Monitoring Station near Highgate Wood, the brook has had an average depth of between and for 90% of the time since monitoring began. In the twelve months to 19 October 2020, the water level has been between and for at least 151 days. Quality A survey by the Environmental Agency in May 2001 determined that the waters of the brook were of a poor quality (River Ecosystem Classification 3 and 4 and General Quality Assessment (GQA) grades D and E)(section 4.2), particularly from sewer discharges and overflows. As a result, United Utilities were committed to carrying out a series of improvements to the Preston Sewerage System over the subsequent years to improve water quality through fewer discharges from combined sewer overflows. A study by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (defra) in August 2012 found that the water quality of the brook was: * upper waters - moderate to bad for biological quality, and for chemical quality, good for ammonia and poor for phosphate * lower waters - moderate to bad for biological quality, and for chemical quality, mostly good but occasionally poor for ammonia and moderate to poor for phosphate The study also found a noticeable decrease in water quality in wet periods, further deteriorating in the brook's downstream waters. Furthermore, in the May 2001 to September 2011, there was a significant decline in the numbers of rheophillic fish (i.e. barbel, chub and dace). It was defra's belief that the primary contributing factors were agricultural outflows (mostly dairy farming) and sewerage discharges, with a noted rise in consensual sewerage discharges. Pollution Incidents As the brook runs through farmlands and industrial estates there have been historic problems of industrial waste, phosphate and bacteria such as E-Coli and Enterococcus entering the waterway. In early May 2013 a large quantity of waste oil was dumped into the brook and another nearby waterway. On 1 November 2019 it was reported to the Environmental Agency that the brook had been contaminated with what appeared to be a large quantity of cow effluent, polluting of the brook and resulting in a noxious smell being reported in Fulwood. Such incidents have been noted as having an adverse effect upon the fish stocks in the brook. Fishing Sections of the brook, especially around the confluence with the Ribble, are popular with recreational anglers. A survey by the Environmental Agency in May 2001 determined that the waters of the brook are of a suitable quality for self-sustaining populations of coarse fish, with eleven (11) different species identified:  align=\\"{}\\" valign=\\"{}\\" style=\\"border:0\\" width=\\"150\\" * barbel * chub * dace * eel  align=\\"{}\\" valign=\\"{}\\" style=\\"border:0\\" width=\\"200\\" \\"white-space:nowrap\\" * flounder (juvenile) * gudgeon * minnow * perch  align=\\"{}\\" valign=\\"{}\\" style=\\"border:0\\"  * roach * stickleback * stoneloach The survey noted that the brook has a surprisingly high number of fish populations despite the pollution risks from the adjoining farmlands and urban areas, and seems particularly well suited to sustaining chub. Furthermore, it stated that flounder, which is a marine species, utilises the brook extensively as a nursery area.

Of these 102 breed regularly. Corsica is a French island in the Mediterranean Sea located west of the Italian Peninsula, southeast of the French mainland, and north of the Italian island of Sardinia. Mountains make up two-thirds of the island, forming a single chain. The island has an area of and measures in length (north to south) and east to west. The status of each species is based on the annotated list by Jean-Claude Thibault and Gilles Bonaccorsi published in 1999.

Gaviiformes  Gaviidae (divers)  Divers are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America (where they are known as loons) and Northern Europe. They are the size of a large duck or small goose, which they somewhat resemble in shape when swimming, but to which they are completely unrelated. In particular, divers' legs are set very far back which assists swimming underwater but makes walking on land extremely difficult. There are five species worldwide of which two species have been recorded in Corsica. * Black-throated diver - Gavia arctica - (Plongeon artique) Winter visitor * Red-throated diver - Gavia stellata - (Plongeon catmarin) Accidental visitor Podicipediformes  Podicipedidae (grebes)  Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds.

History The Lumbee Tribe is a state-recognized tribe located in Robeson County and adjoining counties. Since 1956, the Lumbee Tribe has sought out federal recognition through the Lumbee Act. Twelve years later, Lumbee individuals created an organization which would help the Lumbee people in many ways. In the winter of 1967-68, Bruce Jones (Lumbee), Horace Locklear (Lumbee), Rod Locklear (Lumbee), and Gerald Sider worked extensively to establish an Indian poverty program agency, known as the Regional Development Association (RDA).Sider, Gerald M., and Gerald M. Sider. Living Indian Histories: Lumbee and Tuscarora People in North Carolina. Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 2003.pg 260. It would help primarily Indians, but African Americans as well.Sider, Gerald M., and Gerald M. Sider. Living Indian Histories: Lumbee and Tuscarora People in North Carolina. Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 2003. pg 260. At first, RDA was a shell organization: a charter, a board of directors and little else. In 1970, the organization began to expand inside the channels of the Lumbee people's hopes and claims.Sider, Gerald M., and Gerald M. Sider. Living Indian Histories: Lumbee and Tuscarora People in North Carolina. Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 2003.pg 263. The Lumbees saw the need to expand the association that would benefit the tribe socially, culturally, economically, and politically. As it developed, it quickly transformed into Lumbee Regional Development Association (LRDA), with an all-Indian board of directors and a specific Lumbee focus.Sider, Gerald M., and Gerald M. Sider. Living Indian Histories: Lumbee and Tuscarora People in North Carolina. Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 2003.pg 263. The Lumbee Regional Development Association (LRDA) is a non-profit corporation, chartered by the State of North Carolina, organized to analyze and develop solutions for the health, educational, economic, and general welfare problems of rural and urban Indians in and around Robeson. The effective domain of the LRDA includes, but is not limited to, the Counties of Robeson, Hoke, Scotland, and Bladen, i.e., North Carolina’s Planning Region N. Federally funded programs are currently administered by the Lumbee citizens of these neighboring counties from the LRDA offices in Pembroke, N.C. Since its establishment, LRDA has founded and supported many projects that are either targeted around Robeson and adjoining counties or specifically, the Indians of Robeson County. Projects include the Head Start Program, Thrifty Food Co-ops, Talent Research Project, Lumbee Homecoming, the funding of the Old Main at Pembroke State University and Strike at the Wind.Ben Jacobs, “Overview of the Lumbee Tribe and the Lumbee Regional Development Association,” in 1986: The Year of the Native American, Lumbee Homecoming Program, in the Helen Maynor Scheirbeck Papers #5526, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Great Seal LRDA’s seal, known as the Great Seal, exemplifies the courage and tenacity of the Lumbee people. The fertile fields of the Lumbee people rural home life and the establishment of Pembroke State University (what is now the University of North Carolina at Pembroke) stand as a testament of the perseverance and determination of the Lumbee people to face each new day’s sunrise with the hope of a better quality of life to come.Ben Jacobs, “Overview of the Lumbee Tribe and the Lumbee Regional Development Association,” in 1986: The Year of the Native American, Lumbee Homecoming Program, in the Helen Maynor Scheirbeck Papers #5526, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The current logo features the end of a canoe with the words \\"no boundaries\\" located under it. The LRDA uses this image to illustrate its purpose: just as the canoe continues to flow down a river, the LRDA will continue to uphold its mission. This logo is symbolic to the organization, because it displays the message that LRDA will continue to help others in both the present and the future of these designated communities. Funding The LRDA was a small struggling organization from 1968 to 1971. In 1971, the LRDA received a grant from the federal government to implement an economic development planning project in Robeson County. LRDA received money from the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) and, increasingly, from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) and the Department of Labor; surprisingly, most of the money that LRDA received came through Indian \\"set-aside\\" budgets.Sider, Gerald M., and Gerald M. Sider. Living Indian Histories: Lumbee and Tuscarora People in North Carolina. Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 2003.pg 264 The agency subsequently applied for and received funds to implement programs for community services, educational services, economic development and employment and training services. Currently, LRDA receives federal, state, and private funds for an operating budget of about $3 million. In 2011, it was reported that LRDA had a source revenue of about $3.6 million.\\"Annual Report 2010-2011.\\" Lumbee Regional Development Association, Inc., January 1, 2011. This budget included federal grants (Head Start Program and Department of Labor), state grants, service frees, and miscellaneous income from other organizations.\\"Annual Report 2010-2011.\\" Lumbee Regional Development Association, Inc., January 1, 2011. The agency has never been charged with abuse or misapplication of funds.Ben Jacobs, “Overview of the Lumbee Tribe and the Lumbee Regional Development Association,” in 1986: The Year of the Native American, Lumbee Homecoming Program, in the Helen Maynor Scheirbeck Papers #5526, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Projects The majority of the programs of LRDA are intended to improve the education of Indian people. The LRDA also operates community service programs that serve people of all races equally.\\"Annual Report 2010-2011.\\" Lumbee Regional Development Association, Inc., January 1, 2011. The LRDA operates six projects that are mandated by federal laws to serve only Indians. The Jobs Training Partnership Act (JTPA) project provides jobs training for economically disadvantaged Indian people. The Administration for Native Americans project provides support for economic development ventures in Indian communities, support for research efforts to document the history and genealogy of Indians, and support for the administration of LRDA. The Community Services Block Grant project provides social services outreach to needy families, support for senior citizens activities, and assistance with home energy needs and family crises.Ben Jacobs, “Overview of the Lumbee Tribe and the Lumbee Regional Development Association,” in 1986: The Year of the Native American, Lumbee Homecoming Program, in the Helen Maynor Scheirbeck Papers #5526, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Three educational programs of LRDA provide special services to Indian people. The Lumbee Indian Education project provides educational services to children in the local communities. The Lumbee Indian Education project is funded through the Indian Education Act of 1972, with a budget of $196,000 for Fiscal Year 1977-78.\\"1978-79 Resources.\\" Lumbee Regional Development Association, Inc. 4 July 1979.

While the LRDA has established many programs centering on the Lumbee community, they have funded projects that affect the community and all races at large within Robeson County. Projects have included: the Head Start Program, Thrifty Food Co-ops, Talent Research Project, Lumbee Homecoming, the funding of the Old Main at Pembroke State University and Strike at the Wind. LRDA proposed a plan to create a project that would target a Head Start Program. The purpose of the plan was to ensure and provide enrollment of eligible applicants, regardless of race, sex, creed, color, national origin and/or disability.Head Start Policy by-laws, in the Helen Maynor Scheirbeck Papers #5526, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill The plan seeks out children from the most disadvantaged home taking into account the demographic makeup and targeted areas the program will serve.Head Start Policy by-laws, in the Helen Maynor Scheirbeck Papers #5526, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The drama tells the story of the Lowrie War, which is one of the most important events in North Carolina history. It opens in 1865, at the end of the Civil War. In the play, Henry Berry Lowrie, a 17-year-old Lumbee Indian boy, is confronted with the unjustified murder of his father and brother at the hands of the Confederate Home Guard.http://www.uncp.edu/academics/library/departments/special- collections/elmer-w-hunt-photograph-collection/strike-wind References Non-profit corporations ","title":"Lumbee Regional Development Association"},{"id":"46464821","text":"Inchigeelagh (Gaeilge: Inse Geimhleach,Logainm Inse Geimhleach meaning \\"Island of the Prisoner or hostages\\") is a small village, townland and civil parish in County Cork, Ireland. The village is just outside a Gaeltacht area. Inchigeelagh is part of the Cork North-West (Dáil constituency). The River Lee passes through the village. The nearby 'pater noster' string of lakes collectively known as Lough Allua were once popular with anglers and are now fished for large pike, perch and some brown trout. The decline of fishing has coincided with the loss of salmon on the River Lee following the erection of the Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra hydroelectric dams down-river between 1952 and 1957. This led to the subsequent decline in the fortunes of the village as a location for angling. A hotel was built in 1810 to serve the horse-drawn coaches of tourists travelling the Prince of Wales route to Kenmare and Killarney. It operated as The Lake Hotel (though it never had a view of the lake) until it closed in 2014. Another hotel was built across the street as Corcoran's Hotel but it became Creedon's Hotel and is now run by the fourth generation of the Creedon family. Recent efforts have been made to campaign for works to be done on the two dams that prevent salmon from accessing the Lee river's upper reaches and a documentary called River Runner has publicised the issues of the river.http://www.rte.ie/ten/features/movies/2015/0303/684264-river-runner-the- river-lee-and-the-wild-atlantic-salmon/ Inchigeelagh was the meeting place for the Lyre Company Irish Volunteers, in April 1916, from where they intended to collect some of the rifles sent by Roger Casement on board the ship Aud for use in the 1916 Easter Rising.

As with all loans, it involves the creation of a debt, which will be repaid with added interest. There are a number of different types of business loans, including bank loans, mezzanine financing, asset-based financing, invoice financing, microloans, business cash advances and cash flow loans. Types Bank loan A bank loan may be obtained from a bank and may be either secured or unsecured. For secured loans, banks will require collateral, which may be lost if repayments are not made. The bank will probably wish to see the business’s accounts, balance sheet and business plan, as well as studying the principals' credit histories. Many smaller businesses are now however turning towards Alternative Finance Providers, especially in the case of smaller firms. Loans from credit unions may be referred to as bank loans as well. Business loans from credit unions received the second highest level of satisfaction from borrowers after loans from small banks.  SBA loans  The US Small Business Administration (SBA) does not make loans; instead it guarantees loans made by individual lenders. The main SBA loan programs are SBA 7(a) which includes both a standard and express option; Microloans (up to $50,000); 504 Loans which provide financing for fixed assets such as real estate or equipment; and Disaster loans. In FY 2016, total 7(a) volume was $11,967,861,900 and total 504 loan volume was $2,517,433,000. Mezzanine finance Mezzanine finance effectively secures a company’s debt on its equity, allowing the lender to claim part-ownership of the business if the loan is not paid back on time and in full. This allows the business to borrow without putting up other collateral, but risks diluting the principals’ equity share in case of default. Asset-based finance Once considered the finance option of last resort, asset-based lending has become a popular choice for small businesses lacking the credit rating or track record to qualify for other forms of finance. In simple terms, it involves borrowing against one of the company’s assets, with the lender focusing on the quality of the collateral rather than the credit rating and prospects of the company. A business may borrow against several different types of asset, including premises, plant, stock or receivables. Invoice finance :Main articles: invoice discounting and factoring (finance) In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for SMEs to obtain traditional finance from banks. Alternative options are invoice discounting or factoring, whereby the company borrows against its outstanding invoices, with the ability to obtain funds as soon as new invoices are created. It is often questioned which option is best for your business – factoring or discounting – and the answer depends on how the business wants to be perceived by customers. With factoring, the finance company charges interest on the loan until the invoice is paid, as well as fees, and the finance company takes ownership of the debtor ledger and uses its own credit control team to secure payment. With invoice discounting, the business maintains control of its own ledger and chases debts itself.  Microloans  Smaller loans, usually for loan amounts of $100,000 USD or less, are referred to as “microloans.” Banks are less likely to make these loans than alternative lenders. When they do, the decision is usually based on the personal credit score of the business and/or the business credit score.  Online Lenders  There has been a rise in the number of online lenders offering small business loans. Online alternative lenders originated an estimated $12 billion in small business loans in 2014, with unsecured consumer loans representing $7 billion and small business loans accounting for approximately $5 billion. Nonbank lenders that make small business loans have doubled their outstanding portfolio balance every year since 2000. Some online originate loans from their own capital. Others may use a “marketplace” model, in which they match borrowers to loan products from a variety of lenders. Popular business loan products that online lenders offer include: term loans, lines of credit and merchant cash advance. Others use crowdfunding platforms that allow businesses to raise capital from a wide variety of sources. Secured and unsecured business loans : Main articles: secured loan and unsecured debt Business loans may be either secured or unsecured. With a secured loan, the borrower pledges an asset (such as plant, equipment, stock or vehicles) against the debt. If the debt is not repaid, the lender may claim the secured asset. Unsecured loans do not have collateral, though the lender will have a general claim on the borrower’s assets if repayment is not made. Should the borrower become bankrupt, unsecured creditors will usually realise a smaller proportion of their claims than secured creditors. As a consequence, secured loans will generally attract a lower rate of interest. Lenders that make business loans often use a UCC filing to alert other creditors of their security interest in the property of the business. UCC filings may be placed against specific assets, or a blanket UCC filing secures interest in all property. UCC filings may affect the business credit score and may make it more difficult to obtain subsequent financing.  Personal guarantees  Many lenders require principals with 20% or greater ownership in the business to provide a personal guarantee. The personal guarantee allows the lender to attempt to collect the debt from the personal assets of the guarantors. Small business lenders may waive the personal guarantee requirement if the business has strong business credit scores and revenue. In May 2016, changes to the Member Business Lending rule by the National Credit Union Administration board further improved these loans, by allowing credit unions discretion in obtaining a personal guarantee from a borrower.

He previously wrestled on the NXT brand under the ring name Dominik Dijakovic Dijak began his wrestling career in 2013 under the ring name Donovan Dijak, working in several promotions on the independent circuit, most notably for Chaotic Wrestling, where he trained. In 2014, Dijak signed a contract with Ring of Honor, where he won the 2015 Top prospect Tournament. After he left ROH in 2017, he signed a developmental contract with WWE. He was assigned to their NXT brand under the ring name of Dominik Dijakovic. In September 2020, Dijak made his debut on RAW as part of Retribution under the name of T-Bar. Early life Dijak grew up in Lunenburg, Massachusetts and was a standout three sport athlete at Lunenburg High School. Dijak excelled specifically at football, as he was heavily recruited by many top New England area college football programs. Dijak was named the 2005 Sentinel & Enterprise Male Scholar Athlete of the Year, a Central Massachusetts Shriners All-Star selection, and was named a captain and selected as the team MVP during his senior season. Ultimately, Dijak accepted a scholarship to play college football for the UMass Minutemen. After redshirting his freshman season at UMass and struggling to adjust at the large campus, Dijak ultimately decided to transfer to Bridgewater State University, a mid-sized liberal arts college located approximately 20 miles outside Boston, Massachusetts. At Bridgewater State, Dijak excelled at both football and basketball, leading the football team in both tackles and sacks in his junior and senior years, and led the basketball team in rebounding his senior year. Dijak also earned all-league honors in both sports. He was also named to the NCAA Division III Football East Region All-American team in his senior season playing for the Bears. Dijak graduated from Bridgewater State in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice. Professional wrestling career Chaotic Wrestling (2013–2017) Following two losses in smaller promotions, Dijak joined Chaotic Wrestling, training under Brian Fury and Todd Hanson. He made his debut in August 2013 in a winning effort against Vern Vicallo, and remained undefeated until July 2014 when he lost to Chaotic Wrestling champion Mark Shurman. After earning another title shot in a fatal four-way match the next month, he went on to defeat Shurman in their rematch on October 24 and claim the CW Heavyweight Championship. After a reign of 148 days, he lost the title against Chase Del Monte on March 21, 2015. In 2016, Dijak teamed with Mikey Webb to form the tag team The American Destroyers. Dijak and Webb would go on to win the Chaotic Wrestling Tag Team Championship by defeating The Logan Brothers on December 26, 2016, before losing them less than a month later to The Mill City Hooligans.

Dijak won the 2015 Top Prospect Tournament, defeating Will Ferrara in the finals. This victory allowed him to face Jay Lethal for the ROH World Television Championship. However, he refused to take this opportunity and instead joined Truth Martini's The House of Truth, establishing himself as a heel. His first match as a member of the House of Truth took place on March 7, teaming with J Diesel and beating the team of Brutal Burgers (Bob Evans and Cheeseburger). On June 19, at Best in the World 2015, he wrestled against Mark Briscoe on a losing effort. He managed to win his next pay-per-view match against Takaaki Watanabe at Death Before Dishonor XIII.

Dijak announced his departure from ROH via Twitter on February 12, 2017.  WWE  =NXT (2017–2020)= In January 2017, WWE pulled a contract offer from Dijak, following a legal threat from ROH, who still had him under contract.

On July 20, it was reported that Dijak was finishing up his independent bookings ahead of joining WWE. Dijak reported to the WWE Performance Center on August 21. His signing was announced by the company on September 5. Dijak made his debut for WWE's developmental branch, NXT, on September 23. His television debut, under his real name, came on May 30, 2018, in a loss against Ricochet. In July 2018, WWE revealed Dijak's new ring name as Dominik Dijakovic. Promos started to appear on the December 5, 2018 episode of NXT, promoting the debut of Dominik Dijakovic.

Extant from at least the middle of the 5th century, it became a metropolis in 1083. During the period of Frankish rule, between ca. 1209 and 1278, it was held by Roman Catholic prelates, and remains a (vacant) titular see of the Catholic Church. The Greek Orthodox see was restored with the Byzantine reconquest in the 1270s, and continued until the see's abolition in 1852. History  Establishment and first Byzantine period  Christianity came to Laconia and its capital, Sparta, in the 1st century AD, with the first church mentioned in Sparta in ca. 150 AD. Like the rest of the Peloponnese, the Christian community of Sparta was under the jurisdiction of the See of Corinth. A certain Hosios is the first bishop of Sparta attested, in 458; the see was called Lacedaemon , which was the common name for both Sparta and its surrounding region in Byzantine times. The Chronicle of Monemvasia claims that the inhabitants of Sparta left their city for Sicily due to the Slavic invasions of the late 6th century, and that it was not until the early years of the 9th century that Emperor Nikephoros I (reigned 802–811) rebuilt the city and resettled it with Greek and Armenians settlers. Nevertheless, in the Sixth Ecumenical Council of 681, a Theodosios, \\"bishop of the city of the Lacedaemonians\\", participated, and a bishopric of \\"Lakedeon\\" is attested in a Notitia Episcopatuum of ca. 800. With the raising of the Bishopric of Patras to a metropolitan see in 806, Lacedaemon (along with the bishoprics of Methoni and Koroni) passed from Corinth to Patras; Lacedaemon assuming the first rank (protothronos) among the suffragans of Patras. In 869–870, the bishop of Lacedaemon was Theokletos, who participated in the ecumenical council convened by Patriarch Ignatios. His successor, Antony, participated in the council of 879–880 convened by Patriarch Photios. Little is known of the ecclesiastical history of the region thereafter until the arrival of Saint Nikon the Metanoeite in the last three decades of the 10th century. His hagiography gives many, albeit not always reliable, information about the area, including the existence of a Jewish community and still pagan Slavs, on whom Nikon focused his missionary activity. On 1 January 1083, or thereabouts, the bishopric of Lacedaemon was raised to the rank of a metropolis; its bishop, Theodosios, becoming the first metropolitan. The new metropolis counted three suffragans: Amyclae, Pissa, and of the Ezeroi.  Frankish and second Byzantine periods  Following the Fourth Crusade, most of the Peloponnese was taken over by Frankish Crusaders and became the Principality of Achaea; Lacedaemon itself was occupied, apparently without much resistance, shortly after 1209, as it is not mentioned in the Treaty of Sapienza signed on June that year. In their conquests, the Crusaders retained the existing Greek Orthodox ecclesiastical structure but installed Roman Catholic prelates. Due to the scarcity of the Catholic element but also the few higher clergy available, in 1222–23 several smaller sees, which had had a rather theoretical existence under Frankish rule or were never even occupied after the eviction of their Orthodox bishops, were abolished and amalgamated into the larger ones: thus in 1222, Amyclae was joined with Lacedaemon, followed in 1223 by the see of Helos, which had lain vacant after the Frankish conquest. Lacedaemon experienced a period of splendour in the mid-13th century, when Prince William II of Villehardouin made it his residence, and began constructing the fortress of Mistra nearby. After the re-establishment of a Byzantine presence in Laconia and the start of warfare between the Byzantines and the Achaeans in 1263, however, most of the inhabitants fled to Mistra. Between 1270 and 1272, Lacedaemon fell to the Byzantines, and in 1278, the last Catholic bishop, Aimon, was moved to the see of Koroni. At the same time, his restored Orthodox counterpart took up his residence in Mistra. Lacedaemon remains a titular see of the Catholic Church, counting 18 holders from 1514 on. It has been vacant since 1967. Despite the restoration of Byzantine rule, the see remained vacant or was given to other prelates several times during the second Byzantine period. Thus after 1272, the see was held by the metropolitan of Monemvasia, while in 1289 it was given to the distinguished scholar and exiled Metropolitan of Crete (a Venetian possession), Nikephoros Moschopoulos. In 1316 Lacedaemon was united with the see of Patras, which remained under Frankish rule, and given the bishopric of Kernitsa as its sole suffragan. This lasted until the middle of the century, when the Metropolis of Patras was again separated (and installed at the Mega Spilaion Monastery), while Lacedaemon received Amyclae as its suffragan. The cultural and spiritual revival experienced by the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea led to an increase in the construction of churches and monasteries, especially in the Despotate's capital, Mistra. During the chaotic last years of the Despotate of the Morea, the see of Lacedaemon appears to have been vacant; the last known Metropolitan of Lacedaemon was Methodios, who participated in the Council of Florence in 1436. After 1450 the see appears to have been administered by the scholar and priest John Eugenikos (brother of Markos Eugenikos) as its commissary.  Ottoman period  The Despotate of the Morea passed under Ottoman control in 1460, marking the start of the slow decline of Mistra. The history of the Metropolis of Lacedaemon during the first century of Ottoman rule is obscure: the first named Metropolitan, Jeremias, is not attested until 1541–46, and then he did not reside in his see but rather was a permanent member of the synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. This pattern of absence is largely followed by the few prelates known to have presided over the see in the next decades. The most important among them was Theodosios, who held the metropolitan throne from 1575 to 1592. In 1601, the Athenian Ezekiel was elected as metropolitan, but died soon after, to be succeeded by the former Great Protosyncellus of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, Chrysanthos Laskaris. From the time of Chrysanthos and his immediate successors, Dionysios, Joasaph and Gabriel, the metropolitans once more began to reside in their see, although most of their time was often spent at the patriarchal court in Constantinople. Following the Venetian conquest of the Peloponnese in the mid-1680s, the peninsula remained under Venetian rule for thirty years, until the Ottoman reconquest in 1715. The Venetian period saw a brief revival of a Catholic hierarchy in the Peloponnese alongside the Orthodox one, which the Venetian authorities tried to control by attempting, with little success, to impose their own appointees for the Orthodox episcopal sees. Following the restoration of Ottoman rule, in 1760, the metropolitan Ananias Theofilis-Lampardis was decapitated by the Turks in front of his cathedral in Mistra, for plotting against Turkish rule. A few years later, after the failed Orlov Revolt, the Peloponnese suffered from the raids of the Albanian irregulars invited by the Turks to help suppress the rebellion. In February 1777, the then metropolitan of Lacedaemon, Neophytos, was killed by the Albanians. During the late Ottoman period, the diocese of Lacedaemon counted three suffragans: the bishoprics of Vresthene, Karyoupolis and Maltzine.  Modern period  At the time of the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in March 1821, the incumbent metropolitan Chrysanthos was old and near-blind, but a leading role in the initial days of the revolt was played by the bishop of Vresthena, Theodoretos II, who was a member of the Filiki Etaireia and served as deputy chairman of the Peloponnesian Senate. Chrysanthos died in 1823, and the metropolitan see was administered by Daniel Kouloufekis, Bishop of Charioupolis, as locum tenens. Following the establishment of the independent Kingdom of Greece and the declaration of the autocephaly of the Church of Greece, in November 1833 the Church hierarchy was reorganized to match the new administrative boundaries. Daniel Kouloufekis was formally installed as the metropolitan, and the Metropolitan of Lacedaemon became the senior see of the entire Laconia Prefecture, with seven suffragans: Sellasia (former Bishopric of Vresthene), Epidavros Limira (former Metropolis of Monemvasia), Gytheio, Asini (former Bishopric of Lageia), Oitylo, Zygos, and Kardamyli. Gradually, over the next few years, several of the suffragan sees were merged into the metropolitan see, beginning with Kardamyli (1834), Oitylo, Epidavros, and Zygos (1841), Gytheio (1842), and Asini (1852). In 1837 furthermore, the seat of the metropolis was moved from Mistra to the modern town of Sparti. As a result of the merger with Epidavros, the heir to the ancient see of Monemvasia, the Metropolitan of Lacedaemon acquired the title \\"Exarch of the Peloponnese\\" and the appellation \\"All-Holiness\\", granted to the Metropolitan of Monemvasia in 1301. With the death of Daniel Kouloufekis in December 1844, the see remained vacant and was governed by a committee until 9 April 1852, when the ecclesiastical hierarchy was once more reorganized. Laconia was divided among three sees: the Bishopric of Gytheio, the Bishopric of Oitylo, and the new Archbishopric of Monemvasia and Sparta, which replaced the Metropolis of Lacedaemon.

He was a well-known contributor to the arts of San Francisco and is a founder of Galería de la Raza, a non-profit community focused gallery that features Latino and Chicano artists and their allies. In the early 1970s, he was one of the first curators in the United States to introduce Mexico's Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead) as a contemporary focus and an important cultural celebration.  Biography   Early life  Yañez moved to San Diego, California, with his family in 1954 from Mexico. He was drafted in to the Vietnam War, and when he was discharged in 1966, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. Yañez went to school at Merritt College, California College of the Arts, and Golden Gate College (for arts administration). By 1970 he attended San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) on a minority tuition waiver plan. Some other students and activists he met in the same time period included the Mujeres Muralistas members: Graciela Carrillo, Consuelo Mendez, Irene Perez, and Yolanda M. Lopez, as well as Michael Ríos and Jerry Concha. Yañez married Yolanda M. Lopez in the late 1970s and they had a child, artist Río Yañez in 1980. They divorced a few years later, but Yolanda moved into the apartment next door and they maintained a professional relationship.  Work  Yañez was best known for his Mexican-American pop assemblage art with altar pieces covered in traditional Mexican objects such as beads or candles as well as American pop icons such as the Taco Bell chihuahua. Over time the altars have evolved to reflect the change in time and local community. In 1969, he was a member of the short-lived group called the Mexican-American Liberation Art Front (MALAF). MALAF helped organize, with support from Laney College and Merritt College, three small silkscreen workshops in Oakland community development centers and these workshops were an important part of the social serigraphy movement in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1970, Yañez was a founder of Galería de la Raza in the Mission district of San Francisco along with artists Rupert García, Peter Rodríguez, Francisco X. Camplis, Graciela Carrillo, Jerry Concha, Gustavo Ramos Rivera, Carlos Loarca, Manuel Villamor, Robert González, Luis Cervantes, Chuy Campusano, Rolando Castellón, and Ralph Maradiaga. Yañez become the Galería's first artistic director and served for over 15 years. In 1972, Yañez brought Mexico's Day of the Dead to the Mission district with installations and followed by the art exhibitions \\"Room for the Dead\\" and \\"Labyrinth for the Dead\\" at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. Yañez was a member of the food-based art group The Great Tortilla Conspiracy, other members include Jos Sances, Rio Yañez, and Art Hazelwood. They are known for making tortilla art, which uses a tortilla as a canvas. In 2001, Yañez curated the well received art exhibition Chicano Visions: American Painters on the Verge featuring 26 established Chicano artists, many of the works were from Cheech Marin's art collection. Chicano Visions: American Painters on the Verge toured for 5 years around the United States with 15 different exhibition locations. A book of the same title as the art exhibition was published in 2002 by Cheech Marin.  Eviction  Yañez made national news in 2013 when he and his family; including his partner of many years, artist Cynthia \\"Kiki\\" Wallis, his son Rio and his ex-wife Yolanda M. Lopez were evicted June 2014 from their rental in the Mission district. They held various art exhibitions, events and community rally's related to the theme of their eviction between 2013 – 2014 including an \\"eviction garage sale\\". They had lived in the building that was being evicted since 1978 and their monthly rent was very affordable compared to the current market value, making it difficult to find a new rental within their limited budget.

He was the grandfather of Alice Claypoole Vanderbilt. Early life Flagg was born in the parish of St. Thomas, near Charleston, South Carolina on January 5, 1792. His parents were Henry Collins Flagg (1742–1801) and Rachel (née Moore) Flagg (1757–1839). Flagg's father, whose exact name he bore, served through the American Revolutionary War and was a wealthy shipping merchant from Newport, Rhode Island.Hubbell, Jay B. The South in American Literature: 1607–1900. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1954: 275. Flagg himself was the younger half-brother of painter Washington Allston (1779–1843), from his mother's previous marriage to Captain William Allston, who died in 1781, shortly after the Battle of Cowpens.Hubbell, Jay B. The South in American Literature: 1607–1900. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1954: 274. Some of his early studies were pursued in Newport, Rhode Island.

He took an active part in the political movements opposed to the Federalist Party in Connecticut, both as a public speaker and as an editor of the Connecticut Herald, which he had purchased. He was Clerk of the New Haven County Court. About 1824, he returned to South Carolina, where he practiced law till 1833. Flagg's attachment to his native State was strong, but his devotion to the Union was stronger, and like his friend, James L. Petigru, with whom, side by side, he withstood the nullifiers in 1832, he was true to the last. Designing to educate his children at the North, he then again took up his residence in New Haven, where his home continued till his death. He practiced law until 1842 when he retired. From 1834-39 he was Mayor of New Haven. Personal life On March 20, 1811, Flagg was married to Martha Whiting (1792–1875), the daughter of William Joseph Whiting.

Xi is the second Chinese leader to visit Pakistan in 2010s after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's visit to Pakistan between 22 and 23 May 2013. It was also Xi's first overseas trip of 2015. The trip led to the signing accords for $46 billion of investment in Pakistan by China for the construction of roads, rails and power plants to be built on a commercial basis by Chinese companies over 15 years. Most of the 51 projects were part of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor. The trip also showed the confirming of the sale of eight Chinese submarines, more than doubling Pakistan's fleet.China’s Xi Pours Money Into Pakistan, His ‘All-Weather’ Friend The trip was tremendously covered by International media. The New York Times claimed it to be a 'gesture likely to confirm the decline of American influence in that nation (Pakistan)'.Xi Jinping Heads to Pakistan, Bearing Billions in Infrastructure AidPakistan lands $46 billion investment from ChinaChina and Pakistan to open $46bn 'economic corridor' According to the BBC, the Chinese state and its banks would lend to Chinese companies to carry out the work, thereby making it a commercial venture with direct impact on China's slackening economy.What China’s and Pakistan’s special friendship means In this state visit, Pakistan conferred its highest civilian award Nishan-e- Pakistan on Xi Jinping for his \\"outstanding contribution in promotion of relationship between the two countries.\\" This was the fourth time that Pakistan awarded Chinese Premier or President this award, earlier Li Peng (1999), Hu Jintao (2006), Li Keqiang (2013) were awarded.

Xi was to visit Pakistan in 2014 during his South Asia trip to India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives but postponed it due to political unrest in the country with opposition leader Imran Khan staging a protest in Islamabad for alleged rigging in 2013 polls. In February 2015, some reports of Xi Jinping's trip to Pakistan to attend the Pakistan Day Parade were came in the backdrop of US President Barack Obama's second visit to India to attend the Republic Day parade of India. Pakistan also set to hold Pakistan Day parade after gap of 7 years since 2008. However, in March 2015, National Security advisor of Pakistan Sartaj Aziz cleared that President Xi may not visit Pakistan day parade but confirmed that he would be making his first state visit to Pakistan within the 'next few months.'

Conrad Meit or (usual in German) Conrat Meit (1480s in Worms; 1550/1551 in Antwerp) was a German-born Late Gothic and Renaissance sculptor, who spent most of his career in the Low Countries.Belkin gives his dates as \\"(1480s?–1550/1)\\" The royal tombs that were his largest works still had elaborate Late Gothic architectural frameworks by others, but Meit's figures were Renaissance in conception and style. Meit's work, with its delicately worked plasticity and pronounced corporality, brought an entirely new form of expression to Late Gothic church sculpture. The anatomy of his nude figures draws more from Albrecht Dürer than from classical sculpture.Woods Later many of his works in Brussels, Antwerp, Tongerlo Abbey, and elsewhere were destroyed in the Reformation and French Revolution, leaving the three royal monuments at the then newly built Royal Monastery of Brou, Bourg-en-Bresse, as his outstanding surviving large works.Woods; Burk A number of small works, including portrait busts in wood, and small statuettes in various materials have survived.Woods; Burk The documented tombs and the signed alabaster statuette of Judith (illustrated below) are the main secure works for defining his style.Fusco, 18  Life and works Meit's date of birth at Worms on the Rhine is unknown, and his early life and training are not recorded. He was employed at the court of Frederick III, Elector of Saxony before 1506 and came to work at the Wittenberg court at the request of Lucas Cranach the Elder, where he probably worked in Cranach's workshop between 1505 and 1511. He then went to Middelburg to work for Philip of Burgundy, the illegitimate son of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, who was later to be suddenly made Bishop of Utrecht. From 1514 until her death in 1530 Meit was court sculptor to the Archduchess Margaret of Austria, the regent of the Netherlands, mainly based at Mechelen. In 1534 he moved to Antwerp, buying a house there and joining the Guild of St Luke there in 1536.Belkin; Woods Works produced by Meit there are documented until 1544, but were all lost to later iconoclasm.Burk, 5; Woods Tomb group at Brou For Margaret of Austria Meit made his most famous works, the figures on the group of three monumental royal tombs for Margaret, her husband Philibert II, Duke of Savoy and his mother Margaret of Bourbon, produced from 1526 to 1531. These are at the then newly built Royal Monastery of Brou, Bourg-en-Bresse, today in France, but then in the province of Bresse, part of the Duchy of Savoy.Burk, 5–6 The Late Gothic architectural surrounds were already mostly completed, but not installed, by a Flemish team, and Meit's team added the five life-size effigy figures and the many smaller figures.Burk, 11 Meit's team was himself and three assistants, one of whom was his brother. By no means all the carving of the figures seems to be by Meit himself, and for example he does not seem to have carved any of the putti himself, though he may well have designed them.Woods Philibert had died at the age of 24 in 1504, so Meit's images of him are based on other portraits, and rather idealized.Burk, 21 His majestic grave monument is placed in the middle of the Abbey's choir, with the two female tombs set against the wall on either side of it. The three aligned figures are turned towards each other, as though in communication. Though to the side, Margaret's tomb is the largest.Burk, 11–18 Philibert's tomb consists of two levels and two effigies, one above the other. The upper part, in expensive imported white Carrara marble, represents the Duke in ceremonial costume, surrounded by Italian-style angels (putti). Below this ten small female figures, called the sibyls, point towards the lower effigy, which shows him naked except for a cloth over his genitals. The putti used to be turned to face the effigy, but in a modern restoration several were turned to face outwards.Burk, 11–18 Margaret of Austria's tomb also has an upper effigy in marble and a lower one in alabaster. In the upper one she is shown as an older woman (she died at 50) in full state dress, wearing the crown-like archducal hat. Below she is shown in her youth, wearing a loose robe with her long hair unbound, and somewhat idealized. The two lower figures of the married couple vary the normal \\"transi\\" or cadaver tomb iconography, where a lower figure is shown as decayed remains, and connects to a broader theme of Resurrection in the abbey's art. Below their formal effigies, the couple are shown in their most perfect state, as they would be at the resurrection of the dead.Cohen, Chapter V; Burk, 11–18 To the north, the tomb of Margaret of Bourbon consists of a single effigy placed within an enfeu and lying upon a piece of black marble, with pleurants beneath, a traditional Burgundian feature. The princess is dressed in an ermine cloak and her feet rest on a greyhound, symbol of loyalty. Behind the effigy, putti bear escutcheons with the initials of Margaret and her husband.Burk, 11–18; Woods File:Bourg en Bresse eglise de brou 016.JPGMargaret of Austria's tomb File:Eglise de Brou4 marguerite d'autriche.jpgMargaret of Austria, upper effigy File:Eglise de Brou5 marguerite d'autriche.jpgMargaret of Austria, lower effigy File:Eglise de Brou7 Philibert II de Savoie.jpgTop level of Philibert's tomb File:Monestir de Brou Filibert II.jpgPhilibert's upper effigy File:Church brou angels.jpgPutti around Philibert's tomb File:Bourg en Bresse eglise de brou 024.JPGOne of the Sibyl figures on the base of Philibert's tomb File:Bourg en Bresse eglise de brou 020.JPGMargaret of Bourbon's effigy Other large works Bust in painted pearwood of the financier Jakob Fugger, c.1512–15Burk, 4 When the young Philibert of Chalon, Prince of Orange died in war on 3 August 1530, his mother Philiberta of Luxembourg decided to honour him in the most grandiose way possible. After a princely funeral at Lons-le- Saunier on 25 October 1530, she hired Conrad Meit and another famous artist of the time, Jean-Baptiste Mario of Florence, to create a fitting tomb. They began work at the church of Cordeliers de Lons-le-Saunier immediately after completing work on the tombs at Brou Abbey. Work on Philibert's unfinished tomb was abandoned in 1534 after Philiberta died and a fire destroyed the church;Woods a portion remained visible in 1637 but it was later completely destroyed. The work included 25 life-size statues, now lost, and the Virgin and Child now at Brussels Cathedral. Another project for Tongerloo Abbey, just outside Antwerp, included 16 life-size statues, now lost, for which he received a payment in 1542.Burk, 5; Woods Vierge à l'enfant, v.1530, Musée de la Tour Abbatiale, Saint-Amand-les-Eaux He also carved a Pietà, now in Besançon Cathedral, at the request of Margaret of Austria's chaplain, the Abbot Antoine de Montécut. The abbey of Saint Vincent de Besançon received it from the Abbot and displayed it in a small chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows.Woods Among his other works are two sculptures of Mary holding the baby Jesus, one at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels,Burk, 5 and the other at the Benedictine Abbey in Saint-Amand-les- Eaux. Portraits and statuettes From surviving letters, Margaret had initially sought out Meit for his reputation as a portraitist, and he produced a range of portraits of her and her many relations.Burk, 7–11 A terracotta bust of her nephew Charles V is now kept at the Gruuthuse Museum, Bruges.Meit's portrait of Charles V He produced a great quantity of small sculptures in bronze and boxwood, with some of the nudes, such as Adam and Eve (there are a number of pairs) and Judith with the Head of Holophernes, often similar in style to the paintings of Cranach.Ceysson, Bernard (1996) p.116 A striking wood Lucretia in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, is in a more expressive style.Lucretia; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York There is also an early Falconer in Vienna, and a wood Entombment in Munich. Together, these works look forward to later small-scale sculpture in the German Renaissance.Mueller, 187 Meit's portraits of Margaret varied between those showing her at the age when her husband was still alive, before Meit knew her, and those showing her at her age when they were made, and also reflect her different roles as Regent, archduchess, widow and family member. Some remain in the main Habsburg collections in Vienna.Burk, 6–11 There are also small boxwood busts of Philibert and Margaret in the Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum, with similar ones in Berlin and Munich; a larger pair in marble, for her library, are now lost.Burk, 7–9; Thornton, 196-203 An alabaster head, perhaps representing Cicero, is in the Getty Museum.Fusco, 18; Burk, 11 There are bronzes, which are probably designed by Meit but with others doing the casting.Woods File:Grablegung Christi BNM.jpgWood Entombment in Munich, dated 1496 File:Archduchess Margaret of Austria by Conrat Meit.JPGMargaret of Austria in painted wood, Vienna File:Conrat Meit Margarethe von Österreich c1518 BNM.jpgMargaret of Austria, c. 1518, Munich File:Conrad meit, med. di carlo V, 1520 ca..JPGMedal of Emperor Charles V, about 1520 File:Kunsthistorisches Museum 09 04 2013 Eve Conrat Meit 1.jpgEve, in boxwood, c. 1530, Vienna File:Conrad_Meit_- _Adam_und_Eva,_c._1510-17_(detail).pngAdam and Eve, c. 1510-1517, in boxwood Fame Meit placed his own portrait bust in the library of Margaret of Austria at Malines, which can be seen as a significant step in the development of the status of the artist.Mueller, 169 Meit's work was valued by both Albrecht Dürer, who met him in the Netherlands in 1520–21, and may also have known him from Germany,Woods and Lucas Cranach the Elder. Dürer referred to him as the ...gute[…] bildtschniczer mit nahmen Conrad, desgleichen ich kein gesehen hab, der dienet des kaisers tochter, frau Margareth (the good sculptor named Conrad, the like of which I have not seen, who served the Emperor's daughter, lady Margaret). His reputation as an important sculptor stretched across the whole of northern Europe in the early Renaissance, but after his death both he and his sitters were lost to memory, unidentified by inscriptions on the works, and one figure was recorded in the 17th century as by Dürer, of an unidentified figure.Burk, 21 It did not help that many works were lost, and that he memorialized the last of the Chalons Princes of Orange in the Brou tombs, and that these soon became sited in French territory, ruled by kings with no family interest in those buried there. Interest in his work revived in the late 20th century, especially in his statuettes, where \\"sculpture exists for its own sake in a manner unprecedented in the north, with no relation to or support by architecture\\".Belkin Notes References *Belkin, Kristin. \\"Meit, Conrad.\\" The Oxford Companion to Western Art.

It derives from the Persian word katak-khvatai (\\"master of a household\\", later \\"chieftain, headman\\"). The term originated in medieval Persia. Under the Ilkhanids, the term kadkhuda () referred to a village elder who acted as its representative towards the government, and later, under the Safavids, their duties included the collection of taxes and administration of their village or town. From Persian practice it spread to the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rum, and is first attested in Ottoman usage in the 15th century in the sense of an \\"authorised deputy official\\". Accordingly, the term is found across a wide variety of official institutions and offices, both in the central and in the provincial administration, where the kethüda served as a deputy to the agha or re'is in charge of a department or unit or a provincial governor (beylerbey or sanjakbey). By far the most important among them was the deputy of the Grand Vizier, the sadaret kethüdası; the kethüda yeri supervised the timariots in the provinces, and was also found as a title in the Janissary corps; and the kapı kethüdası was the permanent representative maintained in the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, by provincial governors, senior viziers, or tributary and vassal rulers like the hospodars of the Danubian principalities. At the same time, the Persian institution of kethüdas as village or town chiefs, also continued under the Ottoman Empire, until it was abolished until 1790. The system was also extended to nomadic tribes; originally, while chieftainship was hereditary, the tribe chieftain appointed kethüdas over the subordinate clans, while later the clans chose one of their own number to act in this capacity.

He was the 6th of 10 children. The family moved around a lot because his father was a heavy drinker and therefore had a hard time holding a job. John began helping out the family at the age of 9. He would purchase 24-count boxes of candy from a warehouse for 75–cents and sell the candy for 5–cents a bar on the streets; thereby making a 45–cent profit on each box. When he reached the age of 11 he started delivering papers. At 14, and having only completed the 4th grade, John quit school to work 80-hour weeks running speeders in the cotton mill. It was tiring work that only paid 10-cents per hour but it kept his family going. His childhood taught him never to drink a drop of alcohol, a promise he kept his entire life, and to laugh in every situation.\\"Let John Finger Do The Walking\\" by Eric Neumann, 2014 John Harrison Finger before his inaugural walk Marriage and children The New Deal, in 1933, set a minimum-wage of 30 cents per hour, which instantly tripled Finger's wages, such that he could cut back to a 40-hour work week. A couple of years later, he took advantage of another one of President Franklin Roosevelt's programs by working at the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) Camp in High Point, N.C. While at the CCC, he got into racewalking and finished fourth in the U.S. Olympic Trials in 1936, one position shy of making the U.S. Olympic team. He also started attending Church of God of Prophecy, where he met and married Gertrude Mae Ashwell on May 8, 1937. After marriage, Finger began working at the Pickett Cotton Mill in High Point, N.C. He worked there for 16 years. During that time he had four children, Larry, Yvonne, John and Richard. While his children were in elementary school there was a drive put on by the city and public schools to collect dimes for the polio fund. When his children started asking for money for the polio drive John decided to do what he was good at and that was walking. After all President Franklin Roosevelt had helped him out with the new minimum wage law and the CCC Camp so he wanted to do something to help out President Franklin Roosevelt. Consequently, on January 22, 1949, John became the first person to ever walk for the March of Dimes, walking 32 miles from High Point to Greensboro and back, while wearing a dress suit and pulling a little, red wagon to collect donations. He raised over $1,700.00, breaking the wagon, and became the father of all modern-day charity walks, since the walk was also his own idea.\\"High Pointer 'To Walk Mile To Save Child'\\" High Point Enterprise Jan. 21, 1949\\"Wagon Buckles Under $700 Cash Load; Finger's Walk Cut Short\\" High Point Enterprise front page Jan. 23, 1949\\"John Finger's Trek Nets March of Dimes $1,027.89\\" High Point Enterprise January 24, 1949 In 1949 John also did a walk (86 miles) to raise money for the church he attended.\\"John Finger Will Walk from Washington to High Point\\", High Point Enterprise, July 1, 1949 He would continue to walk for the March of Dimes for the rest of his life, logging his 1,000th mile walking for them on January 23, 1983, on an anniversary walk in High Point, N.C. where it all started.\\"Walking Man\\", The Gastonia Gazette, in 1983, by John McDaniel In 1958, he moved his family to Southern California, where he would spend the rest of his life.

Retirement John Harrison Finger with his Carnation silver bowl trophy and other plaques and photo albums When he retired in 1979, he began pursuing his hobby full-time. He went on several, 30-day bus trips around the United States and showed up at Hollywood studios at other times to collect photos with celebrities.

He appeared on several shows, including You Bet Your Life with Buddy Hackett, Joker's Wild, Good Morning America, the Tony Orlando Show and on two episodes of All In The Family. That's not bad for a man who grew up poor and lost all of his teeth by the age of 60. John learned how to turn his weaknesses into strengths, even making his toothless mouth his trademark with a personalized license plate on his car of \\"NO2TH\\". John's main hobby was getting his picture made with celebrities. With his Actors Federation membership, he gained full-time access into the Hollywood studios.

On Nov. 29, 1984, John suffered a stroke while walking in Hollywood to try out for a game show. He would be paralyzed for the rest of his life. However, he continued his fundraising for the March of Dimes through his celebrity contacts, his humor, and his motivational speeches at fundraisers. Individually, he raised over $20,000.00 for the March of Dimes in his lifetime, but probably indirectly raised more than 10 times that through his speeches. \\"'Walking John' dealt fateful blow\\", The San Bernardino County Sun, by Ione Oliver, page AA1, September 4, 1985 via Newspapers.com.

Dial was a member of the Lumbee Tribe and a graduate of Pembroke State College, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in social studies. Soon after graduating, Dial enlisted with the United States Army, completing a tour of duty in the European theater of World War II. Post- military, Dial obtained his master's degree and an advanced certificate in social studies from Boston University. Hired by Pembroke State College in 1958, Dial would go on to create the college's American Indian Studies program, the first of its kind at any university in the Southeast. In addition to his role in academia, Dial was a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives for a single term. Over the course of his career, Dial devoted the majority of his academic work towards enriching and publicizing the history of the Lumbee Tribe and its importance within the history of North Carolina, and within the greater narrative of Native American peoples. Dial died on December 24, 1995, 12 days after his 73rd birthday. Early life and career Dial was born in Prospect, North Carolina, the son of Mary Ellen Moore and Noah Dial. He was the only son of three children, the other two being Rosa Woods and Grace Locklear. Dial grew up with his parents and siblings on the family farm and attended Indian schools throughout his childhood; ultimately, Dial stayed close to home in Robeson County when he went to university for a bachelor's degree in social studies at Pembroke State University.Oxendine, Linda (4 September 2013) Web. 8 Apr. 2015. Remembering Adolph Dial: A Man for All Seasons Laurinburg Exchange Soon after graduation, Dial, with only $18 in his pocket and World War II raging, enlisted with the United States Army; during his tour, Dial was involved in the invasion of Europe, as well as aiding in the liberation of concentration camps, receiving six battle stars by the end of his period of enlistment. Upon returning from the war, Dial sought further education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but was denied admission due to his ethnicity being labelled as 'non-white'. Despite the setback, Dial applied for admission to Boston University and graduated with a master's of education in social studies in 1953 and an advanced certification from the university in 1958. Tenure at UNC-Pembroke Hired in 1958, Dial was a faculty member of the history department, but is most well known for his creation of the university's American Indian Studies department; first established in 1972, Dial utilized the growing national interest with the United States government and the general public to secure funding for the program. For several years, the program stood as the only curriculum in American Indian studies throughout the entire Southeastern United States. Dial would quickly become a nationally recognized authority on American Indian studies, as well as a leading figure for the Lumbee tribe nationally. Dial's expertise led him to eventually be appointed to serve on the American Indian Policy Review Commission, helping tribes across the country by reviewing the effects on Native Americans of federal legislation and policy. During his time at UNC-Pembroke, Dial was also able to secure a grant from the Ford Foundation; realizing the minuscule amount of information relating to the Lumbee Tribe, the foundation's grant led to Dial's collaboration with fellow UNC-P professor David Eliades in creating The Only Land I Know: A History of the Lumbee Indians. He became well known for his claim that the Lumbee were descendants of the Lost Colony and claimed he was a direct descendant of Virginia Dare.Nieuwsma, Milton (August 18, 1987) Virginia Dare's 400TH Year Of Mystery Chicago Tribune Following his first book, Dial was author of another title pertaining to Lumbee history, this time called The Lumbee, which was published as part of a 64-volume series on Native Americans of North America. Dial retired from his professorial duties at UNC- Pembroke in 1988 after 30 years of service with the university. Work outside of UNC-Pembroke Dial became a renowned figure in American Indian Studies not only at UNC-Pembroke, but also on the state and national stage. Dial's work became commonplace in state publications and even reached a national audience, such as his being published in U.S. News and World Report in 1984. Dial also became a spokesperson for American Indians in his political capacities; in 1972, Dial was invited to attend the Democratic National Convention, the first American Indian delegate to be extended an invitation to a national political convention of its caliber.\\"Remembering Adolph Dial\\" In 1991, Dial was elected to serve as a representative in the North Carolina House of Representatives for a single term. Health issues prevented him from running for a second term to the delegation. Dial also was a businessman, forming Adolph Dial Enterprises; this undertaking led to the formation of two shopping centers, Village Center and Colony Plaza in Pembroke, North Carolina. Perhaps Dial's most successful venture came in the form of helping to start the Lumbee Bank in 1971, and serving on its first board of directors. The bank survives to this day, operating fourteen branches across three counties. Dial was also a founder of the Robeson County Church and Civic Center, and served on the board of directors for the Lumbee Regional Development Association. Death Adolph Dial died on December 24, 1995. By the end of his life, Dial suffered complications due to heart disease, diabetes and cancer. His last years were also marked by blindness, onset from his diabetes; despite this, Dial was able to identify people by their voices and body shapes. He was 73 years of age at his time of death. He is buried next to his first wife Ruth Jones Dial in the cemetery at Prospect United Methodist Church.\\"Adolph Lorenz 'Mr. Adolph' Dial\\" Personal life During his lifetime, Dial was married twice. The first time was to Ruth Jones Dial on June 12, 1948, who remained his spouse until her death on May 6, 1988. After his first wife's death, Dial remarried to Harriet Elisabeth Calligan on December 15, 1990, in Moore County, North Carolina. Dial was a lifelong member of Prospect United Methodist Church. Legacy As one of the first people to give an in-depth history of the Lumbee people, Dial was instrumental in helping garner public attention to the tribe and its history. His work in American Indian Studies helped pave the way for various departments and curriculum to form across the Southeastern United States. On a state level, Dial received numerous accolades including the North Carolina Folk Award and the Jefferson Award, as well as being named \\"Tar Heel of the Week\\" by the Raleigh News and Observer. Dial also received honorary doctorates from Greensboro College in 1985 and UNC-Pembroke in 1988.

The company merged in late 1998 with Sage Network (later Interliant - INIT). Early History Thomas Heimann was an early online entrepreneur marketing his \\"Computer Profits\\" and \\"All-in-One Electronic Marketing Kit\\" which were two products that taught entrepreneurs how to use Usenet/News Groups for online marketing. He came to the realization that the World Wide Web would become the \\"Great Equalizer\\" and de facto platform for online commerce. In his attempts to set up a web presence for his own marketing business he realized that the few companies that were selling web servers and offering web related services to businesses at the time were simply too expensive for entrepreneurs and small businesses, with the least expensive solution cobbled together at the time costing in excess of $5,000.00. In late 1994 Thomas met (online) Rich Skrenta, an engineer with Novel at the time, and the two discussed what it would take to provide simple web hosting and email solutions, as well as domain registration services, and the two reached an arrangement that gave birth to the Global Entrepreneurs Network (GEN). GEN – using the initial domain of Entrepreneurs.net – purchased a Unix Server to be hosted by Rich Skrenta in his basement, and GEN would pay Rich Skrenta a one-time fee of $50 for every domain registered and account set up on the server. Rich wrote a number of Perl scripts to automate domain registration and account setup, and Global Entrepreneurs Network officially opened doors as a membership organization offering two membership plans: Standard Membership at $49/month or $249/year and full-service membership at $99/month or $895/year. Each membership plan included a domain registration, with 5 email addresses and a 5 MB website for standard members and unlimited email addresses and 100 MB website for full-service members. Since the domain registration process at the time was entirely free, GEN became the first company to offer free domain registration via a web-based order form that in turn connected to the scripts Rich Skrenta created to automate the registration process with InterNIC. Originally GEN was started in Thomas Heimann's two-bedroom apartment with a handful of early day employees, most of which worked 'practically free' just for the excitement of being part of something \\"big\\". In late 1995 GEN was able to secure a sublease at below markt rates for class A office space at 100 N Tampa Street in downtown Tampa, where the company would remain for the next two years. Growth and expansion In 1995 GEN hired Raymond Karrenbauer, who became instrumental in designing the first Microsoft IIS-based web server farm, which was a strategic decision that led to GEN becoming the first web hosting provider to offer Microsoft Frontpage hosting in 1996 upon Microsoft's launch of the product, with its $9.95/month Start Smart Frontpage hosting plan. In 1996 GEN reached an agreement with America Online (AOL) and created an 'All in One' eBusiness CD ROM that provided Internet access via AOL, combined with online signup for GEN's hosting services and MS Frontpage software. GEN would introduce the eBusiness CD ROM and its various other programs at the 2007 CEBIT in Hannover Germany. In 1998 GEN reached an agreement with iMall, at the time the leading provider of online mall services, and CardService to facilitate online storefronts and credit card processing for its full-service membership customers. GEN was at the time the world's largest web hosting and ecommerce provider, with over 35,000 customers and domains hosted in over 50 countries. GEN maintained offices in Cologne, Germany, as well as outside of Canberra, Australia, in addition to its Florida headquarters. Some of GEN's accomplishments * Invented the email autoresponder in 1995 * First web-based and free domain registration service * GEN was the largest submitter of domain registrations to Internic and provided DNS services to hundreds of thousands of domains In late 1998, GEN International, Inc (GEN - Global Entrepreneurs Network) was acquired by/merged with Sage Networks, which later renamed to Interliant, prior to its IPO.

The statue was sculpted by Galway sculptor Colin Grehan and depicts a large bull being restrained by two men. The image of the bull has historic significance for the town of Navan, where many livestock fairs were held. The sculpture was finally positioned in the Market Square in 2011 following nine years of controversy over the cost of the project and the proposed location. The scope of the project also included a large regeneration of Navan town centre, with the planting of trees and grass, the placing of new lighting at a ground level, and the provision of stone benches. Description The body of the Bull is sculpted out of limestone, a rock indigenous to the east of Ireland, and it stands 1.6 meters tall with a weight estimated at 16 tonnes. The bull is both lifelike in terms of appearance and accurate in terms of size, as are the men restraining it. The men are dressed only in trousers and boots. They are muscular and bare-chested, and are likely labourers or vendors from the livestock fairs. The statue rests on a plinth of black granite at an elevation of approximately 2 meters at its highest point. The whole structure has a total height of between 3.2 and 3.6 meters as it is on a hill. The width of the bull is 0.6m and the plinth measures 2.5m at its base. The statue features in the middle of the market square and is accompanied by stone benches, also made from limestone. The statue sits at the centre of a crossroad with Trimgate street, Watergate street and Ludlow Street, and Navans main road converging in the square. It is traditional in Norman towns that 3 streets converge in the market square. The front of the bull, however, is only visible from the main road, a fact which prompted significant criticism. History The image of the bull and its location is significant to the history of Navan. From the 17th century onwards, Navan was an important market town and commercial centre. It was in the market square that livestock fairs were held. On a predetermined day every week, local farmers would sell their animals and other countries produce in the market square. This activity was a significant part of the Navan economy. The town supplied much of the food in Meath and indeed was the corn depot of the County. The scale of the economic activity in the market square is reflected in this 19th century editorial of the Meath People, a local paper. Commenting on the state of the locality on market days it reads, However, during the late 19th century and early 20th century, Navan's importance in agricultural production declined as the town became industrialised. The market became far less significant in terms of the food supply and eventually was phased out to later be replaced with open space and public toilets in the 1970s. The Bull was commissioned with a view to commemorating the history of the square, which was not otherwise acknowledged in the vicinity.http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=market-square Controversy The whole project of The Bull of Navan caused controversy since when it was first proposed in 2002 until the bull's installation in 2011. The bull had been commissioned in 2003 but objections to the statue delayed its completion by 8 years. It was held in storage during this period. The main sources of disagreement were the price of the project, the prosed location for the bull, and the originality of the bull in general. A petition was signed by over 4500 people as part of the \\"Navan against the Bull\\" campaign. This campaign was waged by the Anti-Bull Alliance Party chaired by Paddy Pylre and a consortium of local industrialists. Even after the bull was erected, controversy persisted over issues that arose due to its position.http://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/localnotes/take-navans- bull-by-the-horns-26916153.html The location of the bull was a major source of the controversy that surrounded the project. The campaign against the bull led by townsman Paddy Pryle particularly objected to the proposed location. Pyrle noted the issue of the crossroad and the fact that the bull could only face in one direction, saying \\"While it is a fine bit of art, anybody coming up Timmons Hill, which is one of the main entrances into the town, will be entering Navan via the bull's arse. It is one of the craziest things I have seen put up yet.\\" Councillor Shane Cassells defended the location of the bull stating \\"I am delighted that, after such a long time, it is finally in place. It is a striking feature in the historical heart of the town and I am confident it is going to become a popular meeting place for the people of the town.\\" Others, however, pointed out the safety hazard of the bull being placed in the centre of Navan's night-life district, in close proximity to 3 nightclubs and a number of local pubs. Pryle noted sarcastically that the monument would \\"keep the casualty (unit) at Navan Hospital open\\" on account of people climbing it.http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/navan/articles/2011/03/30/4003993-after- a-decade-of-controversy-bull-sculpture-is-now-in-place/ Critics suggested the cost of the project could have been better spent on other facilities such as the local hospital. Councillor Cassells, a proponent of the bull, noted however that it had been fully funded by the Irish Government through Per Cent Art Scheme, and thus local rate-payers were not affected. Pryles campaign did not focus on the cost. The final source of controversy was the charge that the bull was not even an original piece of work. Paddy Pyrle noted that the bull was very similar to another sculpture on the Nenagh bypass, also designed by the sculptor Colin Grehan. Pyrle commented that a lot of money had been spent on a piece of art that was a \\"copy\\". Councillor Brennan complemented the bull, describing it as a \\"masterpiece\\", while Councillor Cassells praised the artist and described his work as a \\"striking feature\\". All three points of controversy remain unresolved.http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/navan/articles/2011/06/30/4005259-mccabe- takes-over-as-towns-new-mayor/ Timeline of Notable events *Jan 2002- The anti-Bull Alliance party is formed by a group of local industrialists and is chaired by Paddy Pryle.

The education program was led by Sally Ride Science—the science education company founded by Dr. Sally Ride, America's first woman in space—in collaboration with undergraduate students at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The twin GRAIL (Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory) satellites orbited the Moon from December 2011 to December 2012. The data they sent back deepened our understanding of the Moon’s gravity and interior composition. GRAIL was NASA’s first planetary mission with instruments fully dedicated to education and public outreach. The MoonKAM program was created to engage middle schools in the GRAIL mission and in lunar exploration in general. Cameras aboard the GRAIL satellites took thousands of photographs during the mission. History The GRAIL MoonKAM mission began in March 2012 when the MoonKAM cameras aboard the orbiting GRAIL satellites were activated. For several months during 2012, students from around the world selected target areas on the lunar surface and sent requests to the GRAIL MoonKAM Student Mission Operations Center (SMOC) at UCSD. Photos of the target areas were sent back by the GRAIL satellites and made available to students on the GRAIL MoonKAM website. Students were able to use the images to study lunar features such as craters, highlands, and maria while also learning about past and future landing sites on the Moon. After completing their mission, the GRAIL satellites were sent plunging into a mountain near the Moon's north pole on Dec. 17, 2012. NASA named the area where the spacecraft crashed after Ride, who died in July 2012. The location is now officially known as the Sally K. Ride Impact Site.

Gender equality is a human right and this is recognised by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)., United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. The right to be free of discrimination on the grounds of sex is found pursuant to Article 2 of the declaration. Gender equality is increasingly framed as being central to the realisation of both modernisation and economic efficiency, and its achievement presented as a key to good governance. As a result, the New Zealand government has implemented institutional mechanisms to promote the advancement of women and gender equality. In 2016, New Zealand was ranked 9th out of a total of 144 countries in the Global Gender Gap Report which ranks countries in terms of women's gender equality in the population under four heads: economic participation, health, education and political empowerment. Albeit, New Zealand has committed to supporting the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and other key United Nations organisations in agreeing to uphold the UDHR. It has participated in human rights deliberations at the United Nations General Assembly and in the annual session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (CHR) and proposes to support the rights of women, children and indigenous people., NZ and the UDHR Further, New Zealand ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) on 10 January 1985, and its optional protocol on 7 September 2000. The Ministry of Women's Affairs is responsible for administrating the CEDAW and its Optional Protocol. The committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women makes recommendations on any issues affecting women that the state should address. As of April 2015, the committee has made 29 general recommendations on issues affecting women that states should devote more attention to. , Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women - General recommendations Overview In the World Economic Forum’s annual report on the global gender gap, New Zealand was ranked in 9th place in 2016. The Global Gender Gap Index ranks countries on how far women are behind men in regards to health, education and economic and political indicators. Instances, where women have rated ahead of men, are not counted as inequality. New Zealand is a party to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In the OECD's final report on Gender Equality in Education, Employment and Entrepreneurship it was found that women in New Zealand do more unpaid work than paid work, gain more tertiary qualifications than men and women-owned new enterprises outperform men-owned enterprises.Gender inequality in New Zealand, OECD report 22/04/2012 Nonetheless, despite the gap between wage equality slowly closing in, the report found that the government funding allocated to reduce gender inequality in New Zealand is on the low side in comparison to other countries in the OECD. History Throughout history, gender inequality has generally affected women more so than men. As a result, there has been a lot of controversy in respect of the matter and activism since the 19th century. New Zealand has had a long history of promoting women's equality. It was the first nation in the world to give women the right to vote in the 19th century. Previously, women were unable to vote until 1893 and were not able to stand for parliament until 1919. The first woman to win an election was Elizabeth McCombs in 1933. Iriaka Ratana was the first Maori woman MP in 1949 and Dame Jenny Shipley was the first woman to be prime minister in New Zealand from 1997 to 1999. Historical inequalities for men include the prohibition of homosexuality for men until the homosexual law reform bill in 1986 and military conscription. Legislation for gender equity The legal framework in New Zealand provides comprehensive protection against all forms of discrimination covered by the CEDAW. In 1973 The Domestic Purpose Benefit (now the sole parent or jobseeker support) , Work and Income NZ, Domestic Purpose Benefit was introduced for all parents caring for dependent children without the support of a partner (mainly women). The Accident Compensation Amendment Act 2010Accident Compensation Amendment Act 2010 also extended compensation to non-earners, benefiting women who do full-time unpaid work in the domestic home. New Zealand has also enacted a number of legislative means to provide for equal pay for women, outlawing sexual discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace and proposes to set out rights in regards to equal employment for career progression in the workplace. Legislation in respect of gender equality in the workplace include the Equal Pay Act 1972,, Equal Pay Act 1972 the State Sector Act 1988State Sector Act 1988 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Legislation for gender equity, National Equal Opportunities Network The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 protects all New Zealand citizens from discrimination on the basis of sex.  Discriminatory laws  New Zealand still has some old laws which have not been repealed or replaced. = Male assaults on females = Section 194 of the Crimes Act, ‘assault on a child, or by a male on a female’, sets the maximum penalty for a male assaulting a female at two years and such assaults are not covered by the less restrictive 'bail as of right' provisions. The equivalent charge of common assault has a maximum one-year penalty and is covered by 'bail as of right' provisions. The Law Commission reviewed the Crimes Act in 2009 and recommended a repeal of this law and suggested that the maximum penalty for common assault be increased so that the more serious cases can still be dealt with appropriately.Review Of Part 8 Of The Crimes Act 1961: Crimes Against The Person The proposed Family and Whānau Violence Legislation Bill seeks to address the limitations of using ‘male assaults female’ as a mechanism to address domestic violence, however Amy Adams explicitly recommended keeping 'male assaults female'.Cabinet Social Policy Committee REFORM OF FAMILY VIOLENCE LAW Paper Three: Prosecuting family violence There are some other laws refer to ‘male assaults female’ which creates further gender inequalities. The Criminal Investigations (Bodily Samples) Act 1995 allows investigators the ability to take bodily samples from people accused of certain crimes. The gender neutral equivalent, common assault, is not included in the act. = Infanticide = A woman can be charged with the lesser crime of infanticide if she kills her child and \\"the balance of her mind was disturbed\\". There is no equivalent for men. In New Zealand, there is at least one case of a man being charged with murder where if he was a woman he would have been charged with infanticide. \\"Otago University law professor Kevin Dawkins ... said he would like to see infanticide replaced with another partial defence of diminished responsibility, to apply to female and male offenders.\\" = Adoption = The Adoption Act 1955 prevents males from adopting female children in certain cases.  Preventing gender inequality in proposed legislation  New Zealand has a mechanism to prevent gender inequality in the proposed legislation. Section 7 of the Bill of Right Act requires the Attorney General to report to Parliament if a bill appears to be inconsistent with the non-discrimination requirements of the act. However, parliament is not bound by these reports. Papers presented to cabinet are required to undergo a gender analysis by the Ministry for Women to determine the potential impacts on women and girls. Developments and present status In the past century, the gender gap in New Zealand has been slowly closing in and there has been an increase in women's rights and feminism. The government is making steady progress and it is evident that the fundamentals for equal rights are all in place: democracy, the rule of law and an independent judiciary. The government has also implemented effective structures of governance, specialized human rights and other accountability mechanisms, and has recognised the vulnerability of particular groups and individuals. Although New Zealand consistently ranks in the top half dozen of countries in the world when it comes to equality between men and women, it is not complacent in terms of gender equality. New Zealand women still do not experience the full equality guaranteed by the law. Across the economy, women's skills are under-used in leadership and women continue to earn less than men – even if they have the same qualifications, and similar job descriptions. Family violence also continues to be a cause of considerable disquiet. However, many of the remaining gender gaps in New Zealand do not appear to be a conscious disregard to the law (as there is comprehensive legislation in place), rather it is largely based on subconscious prejudice and factors like occupational segregation.The status of women in New Zealand, CEDAW report 2010 Political and public representation New Zealand has had a high level of participation by women in public life and this is evident from the modest female representation in politics and the judiciary. However, women continue to be under represented in parliament. Currently, there is a 40.8% female representation in parliament.https://www.parliament.nz/en/get- involved/features/new-zealand-women-mps-continuing-to-break-barriers/ At present there are no adopted quotas and targets to increase the number of women to ensure the equal representation of women in all publicly appointed bodies by the New Zealand Government. Rather, the government has developed a policy of ‘soft targets’ to promote equal representation. This was criticized by the Human Rights Commission as being insufficient as there is no dedicated machinery to guide it.[], Human Rights Commission (2011), p.14 Employment and the workplace The government's current goals and priorities in terms of employment equality for New Zealand women are linked to its broader goal of improving New Zealand's prosperity in the economy. This is to allow women to have more choices and opportunities to use their strengths to maximize social and economical success. The New Zealand workforce shows a pattern of occupational segregation. For example, women tend to work in lower paying jobs, which contributes, in part, to the wage gap. Dangerous jobs are tend to be mainly male occupations, leading to significantly more workplace injuries and deaths among men. With regard to pay equity, the domestic gender pay gap in New Zealand when comparing full-time workers is rather low in comparison to other countries. The gender pay gap in New Zealand was calculated to be 9.9% in 2014, which was the lowest in the Asia Pacific Region.New Zealand women In terms of New Zealand labour force participation, the female unemployment rate is statistically higher than that of men (with the unemployment rate being the highest for Māori and Pacific women). Women generally have higher rates of participation in all categories of unpaid work – within and outside of the household. The amount of part-time workers in New Zealand are three quarters women. Various demographics of women take on more part-time work than men. Section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993 prohibits discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of sex (including pregnancy and child birth), marital status and family status. Gender equality is a topic in the workforce that has received increasing discussion and momentum. New Zealand started as the first nation to have full voting rights for women in 1893. From there, women entered the workforce in the 1960s, although the participation rate of men and women at the time was 81 percent and 67 percent respectively. The report from the New Zealand census of Women's participation in Government and Professional Life shows 60 percent of women have no position of the top 100 corporations. Approximately 63 percent of women's work in New Zealand is unpaid, compared to 35 percent of men's work. The goals of the New Zealand policy is to achieve women's representation in these organizations. Along with this, large corporations are encouraged to meet with the Ministry for Women. New Zealand has utilized ways to further improve gender equality, by creating gender analysis tools so that various aspects can be further developed. Feminists in New Zealand have developed their goal of creating greater equality for women. Equal economic agenda is a pillar of the liberal feminist ideas stemming from the 1980s. The aim of these organizations is to create greater economic independence for women. The goal of these programs is to increase representation for women and help them gain further recognition in the economic sector. The development of different policies towards greater equality in the workforce is championed by the various women's organizations in New Zealand. The Women's Affairs is recognized on a national level in the country. The Ministry also created interactive relationships with different female organizations. The workforce has benefited from the government interaction with women's organizations and helped to understand the change in the various female demographics in the economic sector. The commitment of the government to provide an equal working field is an important aspect of equality for women in New Zealand. There is a National Action Plan to implement UNSC Resolution 1325, which is dedicated to Peace and Security for women. Education Generally, in education, women tend to outperform men and women tend to fare better in participation. = Primary school = In years 1-8 fewer boys than girls are meeting national standards according to 2015 figures. * For reading, 73.9% of boys and 82.4% of girls are meeting national standards. 8.5 percentage points difference * For writing, 63.9% of boys and 79.4% of girls are meeting standards. 15.5 percentage points difference * For maths, 74.8 percent of boys and 76.2% of girls are meeting standards. 1.4 percentage points difference = Secondary school = Fewer boys stay in school until 17, 81.4% compared to 86.5% (5.1 percentage points difference) * Boys are behind girls at NCEA level 1 attainment by 2.7 percentage points (89.8% vs 87.1%) * At NCEA level 2 boys lag 4.8 percentage points (85.8% vs 81.0%) * At level 3 girls are 14.2 percentage points ahead (60.0% vs 45.8%) = Tertiary education = Women are 60% of those who gain tertiary certificates and diplomas. Women also earn 60% of bachelor's degrees and above. 54.1% of STEM graduates are women, however women make up only 22.9% of engineering graduates, 27.9% of IT graduates, and only 11.1% of apprenticeships. = Not in education, employment, or training = Women outnumber men for 15 to 24-year-olds who are not in employment, education or training (NEET). In 2016 12.9% of women were NEET, compared to 10.1% of men. Family assets and resources The Administration Act 1976 (section 77) provides for equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters and there is no evidence of discrimination in practice, or under any informal customary systems. New Zealand women have the right to non-discrimination in the ownership and access to land. The Maori Land Act 1993 provides for gender equality in the control and use of land and resources. In terms of non-land assets, there are no restrictions on their equal rights to property, regardless of marital status. Women also have the equal right to financial services pursuant to the Human Rights 1993. Health Women can access the same comprehensive range of health services as men, as well as having a range of services in place specifically designed for women's health needs – such as maternity services and population screening programmes. On average, women have better health outcomes than men and women generally have a higher life expectancy. However, there are areas in which New Zealand does not fare so well in terms of health. New Zealand has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the OECD with the Māori teen pregnancy rate being rather high. = Suicide = For the 2016/17 year there were 457 male suicides and 149 female suicides. The suicide rate per 100,000 population was 19.36 for males and 6.12. Traditionally the ratio is about 3:1 male to female. = Life Expectancy = The New Zealand life expectancy at birth for babies born between 2012 and 2014 was 79.5 years for males and 83.2 years for females, which is a difference of 3.7 years. A male New Zealander born in 2013 can expect to live for an average of 65.2 years independently, and another 14.3 years with some level of disability requiring support. Females can expect to live for an average of 66.5 years independently and another 16.7 years with functional limitations that require support. At birth, therefore, females can expect to live independently for 1.3 years longer than males. They can also expect to live 2.4 years longer with disability requiring assistance than males Domestic violence The Domestic Violence Act 1995Domestic Violence Act 1995 addresses domestic and family violence against women and pursuant to the act domestic violence can be charged as a criminal offence. In New Zealand the government has implemented specialist family violence courts and means- tested legal aid services which provide referral and advocacy as well as applicant support and outreach for victims of domestic violence. The New Zealand government has made steady progress in implementing fundamental criminal justice reforms that strengthen victim's rights and aims to provide greater protection for those at threat of family violence – most of whom are women victims of male violence. The social attitudes in New Zealand currently remain an impediment to combatting domestic violence and as such, is one of the major barriers in achieving gender equity in New Zealand. In essence the relatively strong legal framework is not always effectively implemented and domestic violence continues to be a challenge for New Zealand society. It is estimated that only 18% of family violence cases are reported to the police and 84% of those arrested for domestic violence are men. However the attitudes towards family violence in New Zealand are in the midst of change as a result of a sustained national campaign - The Campaign for Action on Violence within Families, which aims at changing social attitudes towards family violence. The government has also implemented similar programmes designed specifically for Maori, Pacific and migrant women which are endorsed by their communities. Rates of partner and sexual violence against women had a statistically significant reduction from 2005 to 2013. \\"The annual rate of partner violence offences against women decreased from 8.6 percent in 2005 to 5.7 percent in 2013. The annual rate of sexual violence offences against women decreased from 5.2 percent in 2005 to 2.9 percent in 2013.\\" The latest New Zealand Crime and Safety Survey found that 4.4% of males and 5.7% of females reported one or more incidents of partner violence in the 12 months preceding the survey.

But human rights exist to defend and protect individuality, as quoted by Law Professor Jill Marshall \\"Human rights law exist to ensure that individual lifestyle choices are protected from majoritarian or populist infringement.\\"J Marshall, \\"The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice\\", International Journal of Law in Context, Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72. Despite the complexity of personal identity, it is preserved and encouraged through privacy, personality rights and the right to self-expression. Concept and history The right to personal identity begins with the right to life. It is only through existing that individuals can cultivate their identity. Nevertheless, since ancient Greek philosophy, humans have been recognised with a \\"soul\\", making them more than physical bone and flesh. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was created to preserve the biological and philosophical elements of human beings since its establishment in 1948. Therefore, the notion of individual identity and personality has been encouraged and preserved from the birth of human rights. However, throughout the years there have been developments towards the protection of personal identity through avenues that manifest identity such as private life, expression rights, personality rights and the right to know your biological origin. Private life Article 8 of the European Court of Human Rights has been interpreted to include \\"personal identity\\" within the meaning of \\"private life.\\" Goodwin v the UK (2002) 35 EHRR 18 at 90. Article 8 protects against unwanted intrusion and provides for the respect of an individual's private space. Professor Marshall explains that this is important to be uninterrupted and to \\"think reflectively without interference is to be in control of one’s own faculties,\\"J Marshall, \\"Human Rights Law and Personal Identity\\", Taylor and Francis, 2014 at 36. as Macklem puts it: \\"independence of mind.\\"T Macklem,\\"Independence of Mind\\", Oxford: OUP, 2006 at 6. This protection of inner privacy allows individuals to develop and cultivate their personal identity. \\"Private life\\" has also be interpreted to protect the development of relationships.The ECHR highlighted in the case of Bruggemann and Scheuten v Germany Yearbook the significance of relationships concerning the \\"emotional field\\" and \\"the development of one’s own personality.\\"Bruggemann and Scheuten v Germany Yearbook XIX [1976] at 382. With respect of privacy comes respect for personal autonomy, which Article 8 has also been interpreted to protect.Goodwin v the UK (2002) 35 EHRR 18 at 90. The ECHR Online states that the scope of Article 8 is to \\"embrace personal autonomy\\" and the freedom to make choices without the interference of the state to develop one's own personal life. As illustrated by the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, through protecting a person's autonomy, a person's identity is also protected, as both are integral to each other. Expression rights The Declaration of Human Rights Article 19 and Article 10 of the ECHR give everyone the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Macklem explains that \\"freedom of expression is not merely the freedom to communicate one’s voice to others. It is more importantly the freedom to develop a distinctive voice of one’s own.\\"T Macklem, \\"Independence of Mind\\", Oxford: OUP, 2006 at 11. Therefore, Articles 19 and 10 encourage the manifestation of personal identity. In the case of Handyside v UK the court stated \\"Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of such a society, one of the basic conditions for its progress and for the development of every man.\\"Handyside v United Kingdom (App 5493/72) ECHR 7 December 1976 at 49. Freedom of expression not only endorses individuals to participate and contribute to public life but it also gives them the opportunity to discover who they personally are. Article 9 of the ECHR also provides the right to freedom (and the manifestation) of thought, conscience and religion. According to Locke, thought and consciousness establish personal identity, for these are the foundations of who a person is. In addition, a person's beliefs also contribute to internal and external identity.S Weinberg, \\"Locke on Personal Identity\\", Philosophy Compass University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign at 399. For example, some believe women who have freely chosen to wear the Islamic headscarf or full-face veil are expressing their religious beliefs and personal identity. This has led to much debate and controversy within states which have banned the wearing of full-face veils in public. Full-face veils As of 2011, both Belgium and France have banned the full-face Islamic veil in public places. The ban occurred under the administration of President Sarkozy, who stated that veils oppressed women and were \\"not welcome\\" in France. But Marshall highlights that the ban is disproportionate and it is not government's place to determine what women should wear especially when it misrecognises her and disrespects her identity and personality.J Marshall, \\"The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice\\", International Journal of Law in Context, Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72. While France explains that the intentions of the ban were to promote public order and secularism, Arslan v Turkey held that Article 9 had been violatedArslan and Others v Turkey Application. 41135/98 Judgement 23 February 2010. and that France has failed to recognise the intrinsic worth of women who freely choose to wear such veils.J Marshall, \\"The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice\\", International Journal of Law in Context, Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 69. As illustrated under Article 1 of the Declaration of Human Rights, all beings are born equal and therefore have equal worth. Finally, Amnesty International has repeatedly urged France not to impose the ban, saying it violates European human rights law. The issue of the full-face veil ban in France and Belgium illustrates the extent of legal protection an individual has on their personal identity. Being empowered to make self-determined choices, such as freely choosing to wear a full-face veil to illustrate beliefs, Marshall believes, is an interpreted concept of human dignity and human freedom, allowing each woman's identity to be legally recognised.J Marshall, \\"The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice\\", International Journal of Law in Context, Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 72. The enjoyment of these rights and freedoms in the ECHR are protected under Article 14, and \\"shall be secured without discrimination regardless of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\\" However, these are the opinions of only some scholars. This is a contested issue and others believe that the banning of full-face veils is about liberating females to express their sexuality and providing them the opportunity to show the world who they truly are.J Selby, \\"Un/veiling Women’s Bodies: Secularism and Sexuality in Full-face Veil Prohibitions in France and Quebec\\" SAGE Journals Vol. 43(3) 2014 at 441. These aspects also promote and encourage personal identity. Personality rights The right to have and develop a personality is addressed in Article 22 of the UDHR: \\"Everyone is entitled to the realisation of the rights needed for one’s dignity and the free development of their personality.\\" Article 29 also protects the right to develop one's personality: \\"[e]veryone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.\\" Manuc explains that personality rights can be defined as those expressing the quintessence of the human person, and are intrinsic to being human.L Manuc \\"Features and Evolution References to Personality Rights\\" Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice Vol 4(1) 2012 at 362. These rights recognise the \\"spirit\\" within an individual and have developed from the issues of privacy. Personality rights emerged from the German legal system in the late twentieth century to seek distance from the horrors of Naziism.J Marshall, \\"The legal recognition of personality: full- face veils and permissible choice\\", International Journal of Law in Context, Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 42. It was also a mechanism to improve tort law surrounding privacy, as illustrated in the Criminal DiaryCriminal Diary Case 80 B VerfGE 367 (1989) case. The case concerned the issue of personality structure and having the right to determine oneself. Ederle explained this as a right individuals have to choose how to be related in the world. Through the help of the German Constitutional Court, an individual can actively seek and create an intimate sphere so his personality can develop and be protected. Some states see no need for a specific law to personality, as their system of law possesses a different foundation for personality protection.Criminal Diary Case 80 B VerfGE 367 (1989) at 381. For example, France, South Africa and England have an all-embracing law that protects an individual's interest concerning physical integrity, feelings, dignity and privacy and identity.J Neethling, \\"Personality Rights: a comparative overview\\", The Comparative and International Law Journal of Southern Africa Institute of Foreign and Comparative Law Vol. 38, No. 2 at 213. However, in addition to substantial protection to personality through privacy, the Netherlands and Austria also recognise a general right to personality.J Neethling, \\"Personality Rights: a comparative overview\\", The Comparative and International Law Journal of Southern Africa Institute of Foreign and Comparative Law Vol. 38, No. 2 at 214. Blood and biological right The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child Convention on the Rights of the Child stresses the value and importance of a child's identity. Giroux and De Lorenzi separate the understanding of identity into two parts: static and dynamic. The static aspects of identity concern attributes that make one visible to the outside world, for example, physical features, sex, name, genetics, and nationality.M Giroux and M De Lorenzi, \\"\\"Putting the Child First\\": A Necessary Step in the Recognition of the Right to Identity\\", Canadian Journal of Family Law Vol. 27, 2011 at 60. Dynamic aspects include morals and religious and cultural characteristics.M Giroux and M De Lorenzi, \\"\\"Putting the Child First\\": A Necessary Step in the Recognition of the Right to Identity\\", Canadian Journal of Family Law Vol. 27, 2011 at 60. Under Article 7, a child has a right to have a \\"legal\\" identity by being registered, and has a right to a name and a nationality. These protect mainly the static aspects of identity. However, Article 8 protects and encourages the child's dynamic aspects of identity through preserving his or her identity in relation to nationality, name and family relations. Article 8 illustrates the state's duty to protect this right, both passively and actively.J Doek, \\"Article 8: The Right to Preservation of Identity\\" A Commentary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Leiden: Martinus Nijhoof Publishers, 2006) at 8. Articles 7 and 8 developed to confront the issues of children in political struggles and disappearances.K O’Donovan, \\"Real\\" Mothers for Abandoned Children\\" Law Society Review 2002 at 36. For example, Gelman v UrugnayGelman v Urugnay, Series C No. 221 (IACrtHR), 24 February 2011. concerned the kidnapping of Maria Gelman which prevented her from developing relationships with her parents and concealing her true identity from her. 193 states have ratified the convention, making it the most-ratified convention in history, including all United Nation members except the United States, Somalia and South Sudan.TEACHUnicef, \\"The Convention on the Rights of a Child\\" TeachUNICEF Debate Source Book at 10. Identity is also within people's genes as evidenced by debates concerning anonymity for gamete donation.J Marshall, \\"The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice\\", International Journal of Law in Context, Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 125. Since 2005, in the UK, donor-received people can contact their donor once over 18 to find out where they have come from and prevent genealogical bewilderment.Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Act 2008. However, there are global differences towards the debate; for example, in Canada and the United States there are no regulations, whereas in Switzerland the donor must be willing to be identified, and in France, anonymity is forced.T Hampton, \\"Anonymity of Gamete Donations Debated\\" JAMA Vol. 294, No. 21 2005 at 2681. Criticisms There are some scholars who believe the right to identity must be treated with caution.L Bently, \\"Identity and the Law\\" in G Walker and E Leedham-Green (eds) Identity: The Darwin College Lecture Series (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) at 26. Rosemary J. Coombe expressed her concerns of personal identity becoming property as there is the belief that through marginalising identity, it could be accepted as private and exclusive property.J Marshall, \\"The legal recognition of personality: full- face veils and permissible choice\\", International Journal of Law in Context, Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 242. Lionel Bently is also concerned with this idea and highlights his worry through a quote from the Du Boulay case: \\"Property rights in 'identity'… have the potential to curtail the liberties of those who wish to build their own identities, in whatever way, and for whatever reason.\\"Belisle Du Boulay v Jules Rene Hermenegilde Du Boulay (1869) LR 2 PC 430. Other scholars believe that enshrining personal identity into the law is restricting people's choices and flexibility to transform and change who they are.J Marshall, \\"The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice\\", International Journal of Law in Context, Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 237. However, human rights can also perform the contrary and protect individuals' choices on personal identity. While developing personal identity comes down to the individual to manifest character and work out 'who they are,' Marshall highlights that jurisprudence has evolved to create a positive obligation on states to provide social conditions such as private and personality rights to be respected, demonstrating that the international audience acknowledges that legal recognition is necessary to allow individuals to choose how they want to live and who they are.J Marshall, \\"The legal recognition of personality: full-face veils and permissible choice\\", International Journal of Law in Context, Cambridge University Press, 2014 at 241.

They had eight children. On the death of Margaret Chiseldon, he married Katherine Payne, the widow of his cousin John 'Jenkyn' Stourton (died 1438) of the manors of Preston Plucknett and Brympton d'Evercy near Yeovil, Somerset.

Sir John Wadham was MP for Exeter in 1379, and for Devon in 1401 as a Knight of the Shire with Sir Philip Courtenay of Powderham, a son of the Earl of Devon. William Wadham's mother Joan Wrothesley was a sister of Sir Hugh Wrottesley of Blore, founder member and eighteenth Knight of the Garter in 1348. Married in 1385, Joan was the second wife of John Wadham, who had married first a certain Maud, by whom he had a son.See, John Wadham, Knight (died 1412); History of Parliament; Roger Virgoe. Sir William's father, 'the judge', had acquired land in Devon, Somerset, Dorset and Gloucestershire, which was valued at £82 per annum in an incomplete survey of 1412, and at about £115 in his inquisition post mortem. His Devon landholdings included the manors of Silverton and half the manor of Harberton, both purchased, in 1386 and 1390 respectively, from Cecily Turberville, sister and heiress of John de Beauchamp, 3rd Baron Beauchamp of Hatch (1329–1361)), the manor of Lustleigh, purchased in 1403, and land he acquired at Branscombe and elsewhere. His landholdings in Somerset were even more extensive than those in Devon and mostly consisted of properties forfeited by Sir John Cary (died 1395), Chief Baron of the Exchequer. These lands included Hardington Mandeville, a moiety of Chilton Cantelo, and premises in Trent (now in Dorset) which he purchased in 1389, jointly with his lifelong friend and colleague Sir William Hankford (c1350-1423) of Annery, Monkleigh in Devon, Chief Justice of the King's Bench from 1413 until 1423, and Sir John Hill, Justice of the King's Bench from 1389 to 1407, later related to the Wadhams by marriage. These large landholdings in Somerset appear to have moved his principal interest away from Devon and the manor of Edge, and towards the end of his life he made his principal residence at Merryfield, Ilton, near Ilminster, Somerset, which he had purchased from Cecily Turberville.HoP biography At Merryfield he built, in about 1400, a substantial fortified manor house, still known locally as 'Wadham's Castle' but demolished after 1618, of which only the rectangular moat survives today in the middle of agricultural land south of RNAS Merryfield aerodrome.Merryfield House, The Gatehouse record William Wadham's sister, Margery Wadham, was the wife of John Stourton, 1st Baron Stourton (1400–1462) of Stourton in Wiltshire,http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/stourton- john-ii-1400-62 great great grandparents of Queen Jane Seymour. Another sister, Elisabeth sometimes called 'Isabella' Wadham, married Sir Robert Hill (died 1426) of Shilston who, like his father-in-law, became a Justice of the Common Pleas, from 1408 to 1423, during the reigns of Henry Bolingbroke, later King Henry IV, and King Henry V. They retired to Shilston near Modbury in Devon where their eldest son, Robert Hill of Shilston (c.1392–1444), married Margaret Champernowne of Modbury (1396–1434), and became Sheriff of Devon in 1428. One of the younger sons of this marriage was Robert Hill of Houndstone, father-in-law to Sir Nicholas Wadham (died 1542) who by descent from the Champernowne, Hill and Gilbert families was a cousin of the Devonshire adventurers Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and Sir Richard Grenville. Sir Nicholas was grandfather to the Nicholas Wadham (1531-1609) who posthumously co-founded Wadham College, Oxford with his wife Dorothy Wadham who outliving him, and in her advanced old age, saw the project through to completion. Marriage and children Sir William Wadham first married and had children with Margaret Chiseldon, a daughter and co-heiress of John Chiseldon of Holcombe Rogus in Devon,Pole, Sir William (died 1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, pp.178,189,208 and of Penselwood, Aunk, South Tawton and Rewe, who was Sheriff of Devon in 1406.Rogers, 1888, p.156 Margaret Wadham's sister, Maude Chiseldon inherited the Manor of Holcombe Rogus and a moiety of the Penselwood estate, and married Sir John Bluett of the nearby Greenham Barton and Cothay Manor, Sheriff of Devon in 1445. Sir William and Lady Wadham had eight children including: *Sir John Wadham, born in 1405, the eldest son and heir, who married Elizabeth Popham, a daughter and co-heiress of Sir Stephen Popham (c. 1386 – 1444) of Popham, Hampshire, five times MP for Hampshire, who commanded on the right wing at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Another branch of the Popham family was later seated at Huntworth in Somerset, home of Sir John Popham (c.1531–1607), Speaker of the House of Commons, Attorney General, Lord Chief Justice of England from 1592 to 1607, and financier in 1607 with Ferdinando Gorges of Popham Colony in America. *Lawrence Wadham married Jane Hody, daughter of Sir William Hody (died 1524), Attorney General in 1485, Chief Baron of the Exchequer from 1485 to 1513, the son of Sir John Hody (died 1442), Chief Justice of the King's Bench from 1440 to 1442. *William Wadham, of Catherston Leweston, Dorset,Rogers, 1888, p.156; Pole, p.141 married Jane, daughter and co-heiress of William Payne of Catherston, Dorset where he founded a cadet branch of the Wadham family which included, John Wadham (c. 1520 – 1584), Recorder (judge) of Lyme Regis, MP for Melcombe Regis (1553) and Weymouth (1554), and Captain of Sandsfoot Castle, Weymouth.

Monument at Ilminster Chest tomb of William Wadham (died 1452), Wadham Chapel (north transept), St Mary's Church, Ilminster, looking eastward William Henry Hamilton Rogers in 1888, wrote as follows regarding the monument to William Wadham (died 1452):Rogers, 1888, pp.160–1 :The beautiful north transept of Ilminster church may be assigned, we think, with little doubt, to have been erected by the Wadhams, and in it is their earliest memorial. The structure itself is a fine specimen of Perpendicular, and dates about the middle of the fifteenth century. Two large transomed windows occur on each side, and a larger and very handsome one at the end, having a rose of Decorated character in the head. Outside, the walls are supported by panelled buttresses, surmounted by a cornice of finialed panels with shields, the gable being richly crocketted and pinnacled. Within is a finely-carved open-timbered roof. At the intersection of the cross rises one of those fine towers for which Somersetshire is celebrated. In the centre of the transept is a large high tomb, coeval with the foundation of the structure itself. On the sides under the table is a bold string-course of vine tracery, and below a series of canopied niches, now all void of their former occupants. The whole has been repeatedly whitewashed. The cover is a large slab of polished Purbeck marble, and inlet are the figures of a knight and lady under a beautiful canopy. Above the canopy are the indents of shields, and a ledger line surrounds the whole. The effigies are perfect. The knight in early plate armour, with a lion at his feet ; the lady in long gown, mantle, and cover-chief, and a dog with collar and bells at her feet. Below them are eight lines of rhyming Latin. A large portion of the canopy is missing, all the shields, and a considerable length of the ledger line, of which the surviving inscription is as follows:Rogers, 1888, p.161 ::North side: ... simul cum Willm'o Wadh'm filio eor'dem (cordem?)... que obiit ... die mensis ... East side: Anno D'ni mill'mo CCCC ... et qui quidem Will'mus ... :The month and year were never engraved on the brass, and the badge of the family, a rose, occurs between the words. From the fragment of the inscription remaining it appears probable that the tomb was erected by (a later) Sir John Wadham to his father, William Wadham, and grandmother, Joan Wrothesley, the wife of the Judge, whom the figures may be supposed to represent; the transept being erected about that time, and adopted as their chantry.

The match was played at Lord's Cricket Ground for many seasons, but from 2010 to 2017 it took place at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi. The 2018 match was played at the Kensington Oval ground in Bridgetown, Barbados. History The earliest record of a Champion County match is in 1901, when the 1901 County Championship winners, Yorkshire, faced the \\"Rest of England\\" at the end of the season at Lord's Cricket Ground. Yorkshire lost the match heavily; Gilbert Jessop scored a double century for the Rest of England, while Albert Trott took thirteen wickets in the match. Yorkshire won the County Championship again the following season, and the fixture was repeated, though on this occasion the match was drawn. In 1903, Middlesex were the County Champions, and the fixture moved to The Oval, and was once again a draw. This format continued for the next ten years, although in 1913 the fixture was in jeopardy, as a number of Kent's players were unable to make the match. Accordingly, their team was bolstered by players from Yorkshire, who had finished as runners-up, and the team was labelled \\"Kent and Yorkshire\\". The fixture was suspended during the First World War, but returned at the end of the 1919 season, when Yorkshire were once again the County Champions. The fixture was played annually through until 1935, but was next played in 1947, and next after that in 1955. The match was played irregularly through the late 1950s and the 1960s, and on one occasion was contested at North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough. In 1970, the fixture was played at the start of the following season for the first time. Rather than facing the \\"Rest of England\\", the 1969 County Champions, Glamorgan, faced the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in April 1970. The MCC won the match by six wickets. The fixture continued in this format until 1992, when rather than face the MCC, the 1991 County Champions Essex played against England A. In 1996 and 1997, the County Champions were not involved at all, with England A facing the \\"Rest of England\\" to open the season, while from 1998 until 2003 no exhibition match was played to open the season.

She played a strong leadership role in the Communist Party, serving as state organizational secretary for California in the 1930s and 1940s. She was a member of a generation of women radicals in California remarkable for the significant leadership roles they played in the Communist Party.  Early life  Louise Todd Lambert was born in 1905 in San Francisco, California, to Max Todd and Rosalie Dinslage, German immigrants and socialists. In her oral history, Lambert characterized her parents as free thinkers who encouraged lively discussion, debate, and exchange of ideas in the home. Her first experience with political persecution came in 1915, when her father, a San Francisco baker, was investigated for potential ties to the Preparedness Day Bombing. As a youth, Lambert was active in the women's suffrage movement, the Junior League of the Nature Friends, and the Young Workers League, a predecessor of the Young Communist League.  Activism and Imprisonment  In 1929, Lambert joined the Communist Party in California. She served as state organizational secretary until the mid-1940s. In this critical role, Lambert was \\"second in command of the state CP.\\" Lambert was active in major strikes of the early 1930s, including the 1933 San Joaquin Valley Cotton Strike and the 1934 San Francisco General Strike. During the General Strike, she was arrested, along with Communist activist Ida Rothstein, on charges of vagrancy; both women were acquitted. Lambert also participated in local politics, running for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1931 and 1933 as the official Communist Party candidate, and winning 10,815 votes in the 1933 election. In both elections, Lambert was the only woman candidate. In 1934, Lambert was active in successful efforts to qualify the Communist Party to participate in state elections for the first time in California history. A slate of Party candidates entered the August primaries, with Anita Whitney winning enough votes to qualify as a candidate for the office of state controller. In 1934, Lambert was charged with perjury for allegedly making false affidavits on petitions to put the Communist Party on the state ballot, and arrested in Los Angeles, where she was serving as section organizer of the local Party. She was tried, convicted, and sentenced in February 1935 on three counts. At the time of her conviction, the San Francisco Chronicle referred to her as a \\"big shot,\\" reporting that she was \\"an active factor in communist activities during the general strike and is a recognized radical leader.\\" During sentencing, Superior Judge I. L. Harris defended the impartiality of the decision: \\"The defendant is being sent to prison not because she is a communist, but for a criminal offense which brought a jury conviction.\\" Beginning in November 1935, Lambert served a thirteen-month sentence at the Tehachapi Correctional Institute for Women. Activists Caroline Decker Gladstein and Nora Conklin served sentences at Tehachapi at the same time. Lambert was paroled on December 19, 1936, and resumed her work for the Communist Party in California, organizing training schools for leadership, serving as an instructor at the San Francisco Workers' School, participating in elections, supporting the Communist Party's newspaper, the People's World, and serving on the state executive committee. In 1939, she married her second husband, Communist Party member Rudie Lambert. Louise Lambert continued to work as organizational secretary until the mid-1940s, when the national Party was restructured. In 1947 or 1948, she was assigned a political action position as state legislative director of the Communist Party, and participated in efforts to put the Progressive Party on the California ballot.  The Underground Period  Beginning in the late 1940s, intensifying anti-communist sentiment—and arrests of Communist Party leaders and members, including Rudie Lambert, under the Smith Act—created an atmosphere of fear within the Party. On June 4, 1951, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Smith Act in the case Dennis v. United States. The national Communist Party responded by implementing an underground organization and removing hundreds of the most committed activists, including Lambert, from public life. In her oral history, Lambert recalled that: \\"the analysis of the leadership was that McCarthyism, compounded by this decision of the Supreme Court, represented the eleventh hour before fascism in the United States.\\" In 1950, Lambert was selected to serve in the Communist Party's underground reserve leadership. According to her oral history, she was the only woman in the group. For the next five years, she lived under an alias on the East Coast, separated from her husband and family. Lambert returned to California in 1955. In response to internal party politics and international events, including the Soviet invasion of Hungary and the Khrushchev report, she resigned from the Communist Party in 1958, signing a joint letter of protest with other prominent members.

The park's main entrance is located along 144th Street and 104 Avenue. There are many other entrances that can be accessed by foot or vehicle. The park has a perimeter of and an area of . The park includes a water park, playground, picnic area, nature trails, ponds and two creeks. Hawthorne Park has a diverse ecosystem that contains a variety of invasive and native plants and animals.  History  In 1973, the City Of Surrey discussed land expropriation for Hawthorne Park. By April 6, 1987, the Surrey City Council had decided that the Parks and Recreation Commission had not provided enough details to justify using $100,000 towards the Phase I construction of Hawthorne Park. The Surrey- Guildford Rotary Club presented a $20,000 cheque to Hawthorne Park on November 25, 1991, in honour of having the park named as Hawthorne Rotary Park.http://www.surrey.ca/bylawsandcouncillibrary/MIN_1992-01-13-11577.pdf Satellite imagery shows that during 2004-2005 a gazebo was built as a central point for Hawthorne Gardens. The playground inside Hawthorne Park was renovated and was finished between 2011 and 2012. In the summer of 2000, the City Of Surrey Parks, Recreation, and Culture Department recommended the acquisition of two properties for the expansion of Hawthorne Park. These properties were located at 14350-108 Avenue, and at 14364 and 14372-108 Avenue. This area is now a part of Hawthorne Park.http://www.surrey.ca/bylawsandcouncillibrary/CR_2000-R138-6191.pdf  Indigenous People  QayQayt First Nation Territory The area around Hawthorne Park are the traditional lands of Sto:lo, Coast Salish peoples, Kwantlen First Nation, Qayqayt First Nation, Tsawwassen First Nation, Squamish Nation, Musqueam Indian Band, and Semiahmoo First Nation. One of the groups that lived closest to Hawthorne Park, were the Qayqayt. Due to a small pox epidemic that appeared in 1862, the Qayqayt tribe went from 400 members to less than 100. After the population decreased, the Qayqayt tribe lost almost all of their land including the area around Hawthorne Park.  Physical geography  Geology Iron in water In Hawthorne Park, there are two bodies of water known as Bon Accord Creek and Hawthorne Stream. On the sides of the streams, large, white granite rocks line the edges. It is common practice for workers to position rocks in such a way, to prevent widening of the river through erosion. If the river were to widen, it could cause structural problems, or unstable grounds. In Hawthorne Park, the soil has traces of till, iron, calcium, salt, and magnesium. Calcium is found from the heavy precipitation in the Guildford area. Iron is very common in stream paths and can be spotted if the area of water and rocks are tinted with a copper tone.  Landscape  Hills in Hawthorne park The landscape in Hawthorne Park is mostly flat with small hills and a parking lot. The elevation of Hawthorne Park varies between 101–106 meters above sea level, with the highest elevation being the main parking lot (49.194009, -122.825645), and the lowest being a patch of forest at 91–95 meters. A Trail in Hawthorne Park The land near Hawthorne Park could be considered fertile based on the many different types of berries and plants that grow in the area. This feature in the park makes it the perfect land for flowers and plants, which attracts different species of bugs and wildlife in the area. Hawthorne Park has many man-made aspects such as small wooden bridges, erratic boulders, small fences, and trails.  Trails  The trails at Hawthorne Park are approximately 2.6 kilometers long, and would take less than an hour to walk. Throughout this trail, many of the plants and animals that inhabit Hawthorne Park can be seen.http://www.surrey.ca/files/Hawthorne_Park_Nature_Trails.pdf The trails consist of 3/4 road mulch, causing the paths to be slightly rocky.  Hawthorne Creek  Hawthorne Creek The source of Hawthorne Creek starts behind the properties on the southeast corner at the intersection of 140 Street and 106 Avenue. The creek proceeds to flow through another pipe under a small pathway that runs parallel to 140 Street. The water flows north for a short distance before being directed east along 106 Avenue eventually flowing into the pond at the center of Hawthorne Park.  Bon Accord Creek  Bon Accord Creek, which flows through Hawthorne Park, was named after a steamboat dock that was used in the late 1800s. Bon Accord was a piece of land northeast of New Westminster on the southern shoreline of the Fraser River which was pre-empted by William Ross, John Hasselwood and Robert Halloway. One of the uses of the land was for delivering cordwood up the Fraser River to Yale. In 1885, a fish hatchery also existed at this location next to Bon Accord Creek. Donald Mann, who worked in Canadian Northern Railway, purchased the land from the New Westminster Southern Railway. The name of Bon Accord then changed to Port Mann.  Native plants  Hawthorne Park houses an assortment of trees and plants, scattered around the nature trails and garden. Nursery logs in and around the park support plant life growing in the park. The native tree species inside of Hawthorne Park includes pacific dogwood, paper birch, and western hemlock. The native shrubs within Hawthorne Park include salmonberry, and red elderberry.Hawthorne Park has many native plants in its ecosystem that are common throughout the lower mainland such as grass, and meadow buttercups. Bracket fungi are one of the various native fungi growing in Hawthorne Park. There are semi-native plants within Hawthorne Park like mint and lavender located in the garden area, along with many other plant species and flowers. These plants were introduced into Hawthorne Park by humans, but pose no threat to the native species in the park.  Native animals  The native animals in Hawthorne Park are the keystone species in the ecosystem, without them the environment would crumble and biodiversity would be lost. Native bird species in Hawthorne Park includes mallard ducks, bald eagles, and woodpeckers. Hawthorne Park possesses many mammal species such as coyotes, and squirrels. The garter snake is one of the many reptile species inhabiting Hawthorne Park.  Invasive animals  Blue Heron The invasive species found in Hawthorne Park are the Eastern Grey Squirrel and the House Sparrow. The Eastern Gray Squirrel has a strong impact on the ecosystem. They are a highly invasive species and can be found throughout British Columbia, including Hawthorne Park. They compete with native squirrels for food and habitat, which results in the native squirrels becoming threatened or endangered. They were first brought to Canada in 1914 when eight of the squirrels were released into Stanley Park, Vancouver. The House Sparrow spends its time hunting other bird’s nests and eggs. It competes with other native birds for food and shelter, pushing the native animals out of their habitat. House sparrows were brought to Stanley Park, British Columbia in 1898, and later on migrated to Hawthorne Park. There have also been sightings of the Blue Heron. Environmental issues   Land pollution  Land pollution is when pollutants or harmful chemicals get into the soil and change its quality. There is currently a large amount of litter in Hawthorne Park, mainly food packaging, cigarette butts or filters, furniture, and other garbage. Ducks, coyotes and other wildlife may ingest litter, which can block the intestinal tract of animals and result is disease or death. Furthermore, there is the chance that the animals at Hawthorne Park could get tangled up in plastic material and suffocate.  Water pollution  Litter and chemicals in Hawthorne Creek and Bon Accord Creek can change the pH level, affect the turbidity, and destroy habitats. An acidic or alkaline pH level can result in the death of insects, fish, and plants in the water, while a high turbidity prevents sunlight from reaching aquatic plants requiring photosynthesis. The origins of the chemical substances in the water can likely be traced to the storm drains, car fluids, cigarette butts or filters and possibly even drugs in the proximity. Cigarettes especially, can leak many toxic chemicals into the water that may harm the aquatic ecosystems. Aside from the chemicals, littering and the dumping of large objects destroy plant life, as well as the habitats of animals or insects. Animals, such as dogs, take in nitrates and nitrites from their food, if these nitrates are excreted and come into contact with the water, eutrophication can occur. Water quality has been monitored since fall 2014, in a collaboration between students in a nearby school and the Take the Dip organization.

He has played a key role in the shaping of the modern industrial and medical cannabis reform movements as the author of such seminal books as Hemp: Lifeline to the Future (1993) and Hemp for Health (1997), as well as through his activist work as the co-founder and first President of the Hemp Industries Association (HIA), founder of the Business Alliance in Commerce and Hemp (BACH), and a signature gathering coordinator for the Proposition 215 volunteer effort which made California the first US state to legalize the medical use of cannabis. The December, 1999 issue of High Times ranked Conrad #10 on its list of top 25 \\"living legends in the battle for legal cannabis.\\" Books Conrad's writing career began when he designed and edited a revised edition of the hemp prohibition classic The Emperor Wears No Clothes by Jack Herer in 1990. He followed this with the publication of Hemp: Lifeline to the Future (1993), which was subsequently translated into Italian, and Hemp for Health (1997), which was subsequently translated into Spanish, Portuguese, Czech and German. He is also the author of Cannabis Yields and Dosages (2004) and Nostradamus and the Attack on New York. Conrad has co-authored two books with collaborators Virginia Resner and his wife Mikki Norris: Shattered Lives: Portraits From America's Drug War and Human Rights and the US Drug War. In 2007, Conrad contributed a chapter on cannabis history to Pourquoi & Comment Cultiver Du Chanvre by Michka, where his writing appeared alongside contributions from other notable authors such as Jorge Cervantes, Raphael Mechoulam and Stephen Jay Gould. Activist career In 1989, Conrad and his wife Mikki Norris co-founded the American Hemp Council, with the purpose of educating the American public on the many uses of industrial hemp and the laws against the crop in the United States. In 1996, in the final weeks of the campaign (after the money came in and he was hired to do so), Conrad became the signature-gathering coordinator for the volunteer effort to pass California's Proposition 215, the initiative which would go on to make the state the first in the US to legalize the medical use of marijuana. He was also a vocal supporter of California's Proposition 19 in 2010, which came within four points of making California the first state to legalize all adult uses of cannabis. Conrad has also been active in the movement to legalize industrial hemp, serving as the first president of the Hemp Industries Association (HIA) and founding the Business Alliance of Commerce in Hemp (BACH). Oaksterdam faculty Since 2007, Conrad has taught at Oaksterdam University's Oakland, California campus, where he teaches the history and politics of cannabis. Exhibits curated In 1993 and 2000, Conrad curated and designed the Hash-Marijuana-Hemp Museum in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In 1995, Conrad and his wife Mikki Norris partnered with Virginia Resner to create and curate the \\"Human Rights '95: Atrocities of the Drug War\\" photo exhibit to put a human face on non-violent prisoners of the Drug War and to show how the Drug War operates through their stories. Launched at the Fort Mason Center in San Francisco on June 24, 1995 for the 50th Anniversary the United Nations, the exhibit was put in context of the UN's Declaration on Human Rights. The grand opening presented a program called, \\"Give Drug Peace a Chance,\\" that included Ram Dass, Paul Krassner, Jello Biafra, Ngaio Bealum, New Riders of the Purple Sage, and Terence Hallinan. They toured with this exhibit for many years, creating smaller excerpted displays that were shown at libraries, universities, conferences, and events under the name \\"Human Rights and the Drug War.\\" From 2011 to the present, Conrad has curated the Oaksterdam Cannabis Museum in Oakland, California. Awards In 2014, Conrad and his wife Mikki Norris were jointly awarded the Seattle Hempfest Outstanding Cannabis Activist Award in recognition of their writing and advocacy work. In 2010, Conrad was the recipient of Oaksterdam University's Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004, Conrad and Norris received the Outstanding Citizen Activism Award at the 2004 national NORML conference. In 2001, Conrad and Norris received the Drug Policy Alliance's Robert C. Randall Award for Achievement in the Field of Citizen Action, along with collaborator Virginia Resner, Randy Credico of the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice and Nora Callahan of the November Coalition.

It blended both garage and psychedelic rock influences, and was marked by distorted guitar instrumentals that were early examples of protopunk. It features the band's harder-edged interpretations of songs, with only three original compositions. The album was preceded by two non-album singles, \\"Sweet Young Thing\\" and \\"Misty Lane\\", and track singles, \\"No Way Out\\" and \\"Are You Gonna be There (At the Love-in)\\". However, none of the singles managed to chart. Like its singles, No Way Out failed to reach the Billboard 200, but it established the group as a popular live act, and later became noted as a garage rock classic. Background Recording sessions took place in mid-1967 at American Recording Studios, located in Los Angeles, California, with record producer, Ed Cobb. Progress on the album was rapid, although the percussion, harmonica, and vocals were overdubbed onto the tracks after the initial instrumental recordings were complete. The band held little power in the recording studio as Cobb selected the compositions that appeared on the album. Only the title song, \\"No Way Out\\", was an original song written by a Chocolate Watchband member. In all, only four tracks included the whole band, and were released in their intended form. The remaining songs replaced David Aguilar's vocals with session musician Don Bennett and added embellished instrumentals. Music critic Bruce Eder described the material on the album as \\"highly potent, slashing, exciting, clever pieces of music\\". Even though the original tracks were tampered with, and did not actually feature the complete band, the songs still achieved an equal balance of gritty garage rock and the druggy ambiance of psychedelic rock. Of all the experimentally punkish tracks and Jagger-esque vocals, the centerpiece of the album ironically did not feature Aguilar as the lead vocalist. The opening track, \\"Let's Talk About Girls\\" became a favorite among the Chocolate Watchband's followers, despite Bennett being credited as the lead singer. In 1972, the song was included in the compilation album Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968. The album was released in September 1967, but was mistakenly distributed on Tower Records' Uptown label, a division that mainly promoted blues musicians. Although the album was largely overlooked at the time of its release and had gone out of print by the early 1970s, its reputation has continued to expand over the years. The late 1980s saw the revival of interest in garage rock and, more specifically, the band's music, so in 1993 the album was reissued by Big Beat Records in 1993 as No Way Out...Plus. The reissue included eight bonus tracks. In 1994, the album was made available, along with the group's second album, The Inner Mystique, by Revenge Records titled, No Way Out/The Inner Mystique. Since then, Sundazed Records has released the album in 1994, 2009, and 2012.

It is a small, rare shrub with fleshy leaves and white heads of flowers. Description Melaleuca sculponeata is a shrub growing to about tall with branches and leaves that are glabrous when mature. Its leaves are arranged in alternating pairs, each pair at right angles to the ones above and below (decussate) so that the leaves form four rows along the stems. Each leaf is long and wide, narrow oblong in shape and fleshy with the lower part of the leaf touching the stem. The leaf is concave on the upper surface, convex on the lower surface where 6 to 8 oil glands are visible but not prominent. The flowers are white and arranged in heads on the sides of the branches. Each head contains 4 to 12 individual flowers. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and there are 8 to 12 stamens per bundle. The main flowering period is in October and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long, in diameter forming clusters on the old wood. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca sculponeata was first formally described in 1992 by Bryan Barlow in Nuytsia as a new species. The specific epithet (sculponeata) is from the Latin sculponea meaning \\"wooden shoe\\" referring to the leaves, when removed from the stem, appearing like clogs. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca sculponeata occurs in two small, isolated populations in the Fitzgerald River and the Lake King districts in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions.

Available in a black polymer frame with a black tenifer coated slide or a black polymer frame with a stainless finish slide. The pistol comes from the factory with a carry case and two 16 round magazines, or three 10 round magazines for the Canadian version. Features integral to the PPX include a reversible, ambidextrous magazine release, two inherent drop safety mechanisms,a firing pin block safety, and a grip designed according to other ergonomic Walther grips but lacks the interchangeable backstraps of other Walther models. There is no magazine disconnect safety meaning the pistol will fire with a round in the chamber even if the magazine is removed. The Walther PPX has no other external manually operated safety mechanisms making it a simple and clean design but one that requires a holster that completely protects the trigger particularly if the pistol is to be carried with a round in the chamber. The PPX is a hammer fired pistol but the hammer is partially cocked by the action after each round is fired making for a very light and crisp trigger pull similar in feel to a striker fired pistol. There is no second strike capability. The pistol frame has an integral Picatinny rail below the barrel. A small lanyard hole is molded into the frame behind the magazine well. On threaded barrel models there is a small removable protective cap installed on the threads of the barrel crown.

Incident On the night of February 27, 2000, the three youths, ages 14, 17 and 18, confessed to throwing rocks at vehicles moving along the B3 motorway, saying that they had been \\"meeting regularly\\" for the past four to six weeks to throw rocks at cars. A fourth teenager (age 15) was questioned and released. The teenagers left a bowling alley near their homes in a base housing complex called Lincoln Village at about 9pm. They carried a snow shovel and some rocks to a pedestrian bridge over the B3 motorway, where they climbed a 6' (or 8') plastic wall and began throwing rocks at passing cars. Finding that the rocks were not heavy enough to cause the cars to crash, they returned to an area near their school, where they found larger rocks, up to 18 lbs. in weight, and carried them back to the highway where two of the boys handed the rocks to the third, who had climbed onto the wall. They threw a 10-pound rock at a Mercedes-Benz driven by Karin Rothermel, 41, hitting her in the chest and killing her instantly. Rothermel's 75-year-old grandmother was critically injured. At this point they moved to the other side of the bridge, and began hurling rocks at cars moving in the opposite direction, causing one car to crash as it swerved to avoid the rocks. The three then dropped an 18-pound stone onto a BMW driven by Sandra Ottmann, 20, who was driving her grandparents home from a meal celebrating her grandfather's birthday. The rock hit Ottman in the head, killing her. The 17- and 18-year-old rock-throwers were convicted of murder and given terms of 8-and-a-half years each in juvenile facilities; the 14-year-old was given seven years. The three were released early for good behavior and returned to the United States after serving half of their sentences. Later incidents A similar rock throwing occurred near the same base in 2003; no one was injured. The children involved ranged in age from 4 to 9 years old. Reactions *Secretary of Defense William Cohen, said, in a statement issued by the American Embassy in Berlin, that he was \\"shocked and saddened\\" by the \\"tragic accident\\" and pledged to cooperate closely with German authorities in the investigation. He said that American thoughts and prayers were with the victims' families.

Founded in 1983, the center is located at Keene State College in New Hampshire. The center was founded by Dr. Charles Hildebrandt. Overview The Cohen Center is located in the heart of Keene State College on the first floor of Mason Library. Visitors will often find the Center's Susan J. Herman Reading Room in active use, either by a class in the academic program, a meeting or other gathering for the Center, or by students using the room for study and reflection. The Center provides extensive educational support for the study and the teaching of the Holocaust and genocide in KSC's academic programs that features a nationally recognized undergraduate major in Holocaust and Genocide Studies. The Center also provides materials and support for educators at the elementary, middle school, high school, and college levels. In addition, the Center offers public workshops and other educational programs designed to engage regional residents and community leaders. The Center supports the college's undergraduates and hosts a series of annual events. To date, over 300 individuals and institutions throughout the state, region, and nation have joined the college in supporting the Cohen Center's efforts to confront antisemitism, intolerance, and hate; and to build communities distinguished by active regard for the welfare of all its citizens. In this spirit, Keene State College through the Cohen Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, and a number of other similarly committed programs, embodies an exemplary partnership between public higher education and the communities it serves. Mission The Cohen Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies advances the public liberal arts mission of Keene State College by studying and bearing witness to the Holocaust and genocide in the hope that present and future generations take responsibility for building a world free of antisemitism, intolerance, and hate. To this end, the Cohen Center joins the campus community and its many partners in promoting an active and informed citizenry committed to mutual respect and justice. History The Cohen Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies is much more than a resource center, though that is how the center began. In conjunction with his commitments to racial, ethnic, and religious diversity, Prof. Charles Hildebrandt undertook a sabbatical in fall 1982 with the express purpose of establishing a Holocaust Resource Center at Keene State College, to develop a course on the Sociology of the Holocaust, and to become a resource person on the subject for his colleagues and friends of the college in the community. With a little over 200 books collected during his sabbatical, Prof. Hildebrandt opened the Holocaust Resource Center at Keene State College in January 1983. In 2000, the Center became the Center for Holocaust Studies and then, a year later, the Cohen Center for Holocaust Studies in 2001 when the College received a transformative gift from Jan and Rick Cohen to underwrite significant portions of the Center's work and to name the center in honor of Rick's parents, Lester and Norma Cohen. Later, in September 2009, the name grew to the Cohen Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies to express the Center's expanded mission to include its study and work with genocide. The original resource center has grown from a collection of 200 books and other media to a library of nearly 6,000 volumes, which supports the college's academic program in Holocaust and Genocide Studies. The program, the first undergraduate major in Holocaust and Genocide Studies in the nation, includes both an inter-disciplinary major and minor in this subject area. The program became a formal department at the college in 2012. Events The programs sponsored and coordinated by the Cohen Center include two annual public lectures (the Holocaust Memorial Lecture and the Genocide Awareness Lecture), a community-wide Kristallnacht Remembrance Event hosted annually by the Colonial Theatre, yearly trips (one for students, one for community leaders) to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, an annual Hildebrandt Awards Night, a yearly commemoration of Yom HaShoah, and a variety of outreach opportunities for educators and other community leaders, including a biennial, residential Summer Institute on Holocaust and Genocide Studies. ;Holocaust Memorial Lecture Held in the fall, the annual Holocaust Memorial Lecture draws prominent scholars, organizers, survivors and family members, and community leaders for an evening of historical perspective and current events. ;Kristallnacht Commemoration This annual event seeks to bring the community together to bear witness and recognize our responsibility to promote an active and informed citizenry, recognize individual and societal responsibility for each other, and foster mutual respect and justice. ;Genocide Awareness Lecture The Genocide Awareness Lecture is designed to encourage people of good will and conscience to give vigilant, public attention to the signs and symptoms of genocide. Staff The Center is guided by a professional staff of three: Henry Knight, Director; Tom White, Coordinator of Educational Outreach, and Michele Kuiawa, Senior Program Support Assistant. They are supported by an active, volunteer Advisory Council and work synergistically with members of the faculty in Holocaust and Genocide Studies, especially Prof. C. Paul Vincent, chair of the academic program, and Prof. James Waller, Cohen Professor of Holocaust & Genocide Studies. Awards The Charles Hildebrandt Holocaust and Genocide Studies Award honors Charles Hildebrandt, Keene State College's professor emeritus in sociology and founder of the Holocaust Resource Center at Keene State in 1983. It is given in recognition of excellence in Holocaust or Genocide Studies. Students and members of the local community are invited to submit essays, historical analyses, stories, poems, musical compositions, dance, film, theatre and visual arts exploring and expressing their own personal relationship to or reflections on the Holocaust or genocide. Awards totaling $1000 will be distributed among the top three entrants. The Susan J. Herman Award for Leadership in Holocaust & Genocide Awareness, which will be permanently endowed, will be used to recognize individuals who have, through personal leadership and actions, stimulated greater understanding of genocide, increased activism on behalf of the victims of crimes against humanity or inspired community engagement in educating people about genocide both historically and in our contemporary world. The Herman Award will be presented in two categories each year.

He showed that the expression of the rate constant given by the Arrhenius equation had to be composed of two terms. In addition to the activation energy term, he considered that there had to be an activation entropy term. In 1910, Rene Marcelin introduced the concept of standard Gibbs energy of activation. In 1912, he treated the progress of a chemical reaction as a motion of a point in phase space. Using Gibbs' statistical-mechanical methods, he obtained an expression similar to the one which he had obtained earlier from thermodynamic consideration. In 1913, René Marcelin was also the first to use the term potential energy surface.René Marcelin, Journal of Chim. Phys.

History 1st formation  The 11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) adopted a resolution on the strengthening of the Red Army. It demanded to establish a strictly organized military, educational and economic conditions in the army. At the same time acknowledged burdensome for the country an army of 1,600,000 men. After the Congress, the Party Central Committee decided to reduce the Red Army at the end of 1922 to 800,000 people. Reduction of the army necessitated the restructuring of management and organizational structure of troops. The supreme military unit became a corps consisting of two or three divisions. Division consisted of three Regiments. Brigades as an independent union was abolished. In the second half of 1922 begins the construction of Rifle Corps headquarters. By order of the Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Crimea № 654/168 dated June 1, 1922, Zaporozhye in Ukrainian Military District (hereinafter UkrVO) formation of the body. In the corps entered 25th and 30th Infantry Division. In 1923, the 80th Rifle Division joined the corps. In June 1924 the corps headquarters moved to Dnepropetrovsk. In 1925 the body was in the structure 25, 30 and 80th Rifle Division. In 1931, the body had in its composition 25, 30 and 75th Rifle Division. On 17 May 1935, the Ukrainian Military District was divided into Kharkov and Kiev Military District. The corps became part of Kharkov Military District. On 1 July 1935, the corps included the 30th, 41st and 80th Rifle Divisions. Corps headquarters was: * In Zaporozhye (1 June 1922 – June 1924). * In Dnepropetrovsk (June 1924 – September 1939). * In Zhmerynka (September – October 1939). * In Dnepropetrovsk (October 1939 – 1941). On 22 June 1941, the corps was under General Major K.L. Dobroserdov, and comprised the 116th Rifle Division – Col. Ya.F. Eremenko, the 196th Rifle Division – Maj. Gen. K.E. Kulikov, and the 206th Rifle Division – Col.

From June 22 to August 1941 the corps participated in the Soviet defence against the German Operation Barbarossa. The corps was disestablished in August 1941. The corps was reestablished in September 1942 near Saratov. At the end of September, it was relocated to Kharabali. The corps included the 93rd, 96th and 97th Separate Rifle Brigades. From October, the division fought in the Battle of Stalingrad as part of the 64th Army. After the end of the battle, it stayed in the Stalingrad area to replenish its personnel. On 19 April 1943, it became the 35th Guards Rifle Corps for its achievements in battle.Keith E. Bonn, Slaughterhouse, 2005, 340. 7th Rifle Corps was reestablished again in June 1943. The corps fought in the Battle of Berlin. On 10 July 1945 the corps was part of 3rd Shock Army and comprised 146th, 265th, and 364th Rifle Divisions.

The main purpose of the cloudlet is supporting resource-intensive and interactive mobile applications by providing powerful computing resources to mobile devices with lower latency. It is a new architectural element that extends today’s cloud computing infrastructure. It represents the middle tier of a 3-tier hierarchy: mobile device - cloudlet - cloud. A cloudlet can be viewed as a data center in a box whose goal is to bring the cloud closer. The cloudlet term was first coined by M. Satyanarayanan, Victor Bahl, Ramón Cáceres, and Nigel Davies, and a prototype implementation is developed by Carnegie Mellon University as a research project. The concept of cloudlet is also known as follow me cloud, and mobile micro-cloud. Motivation Many mobile services split the application into a front-end client program and a back-end server program following the traditional client-server model. The front-end mobile application offloads its functionality to the back-end servers for various reasons such as speeding up processing. With the advent of cloud computing, the back-end server is typically hosted at the cloud datacenter. Though the use of a cloud datacenter offers various benefits such as scalability and elasticity, its consolidation and centralization lead to a large separation between a mobile device and its associated datacenter. End-to-end communication then involves many network hops and results in high latencies and low bandwidth. For the reasons of latency, some emerging mobile applications require cloud offload infrastructure to be close to the mobile device to achieve low response time. In the ideal case, it is just one wireless hop away. For example, the offload infrastructure could be located in a cellular base station or it could be LAN- connected to a set of Wi-Fi base stations. The individual elements of this offload infrastructure are referred to as cloudlets. Applications Cloudlets aim to support mobile applications that are both resource-intensive and interactive. Augmented reality applications that use head-tracked systems require end-to-end latencies of less than 16 ms. Cloud games with remote rendering also require low latencies and high bandwidth. Wearable cognitive assistance systems combine devices such as Google Glass with cloud-based processing to guide users through complex tasks. This futuristic genre of applications is characterized as “astonishingly transformative” by the report of the 2013 NSF Workshop on Future Directions in Wireless Networking. These applications use cloud resources in the critical path of real-time user interaction. Consequently, they cannot tolerate end-to-end operation latencies of more than a few tens of milliseconds. Apple Siri and Google Now which perform compute-intensive speech recognition in the cloud, are further examples in this emerging space. Cloudlet vs Cloud There is significant overlap in the requirements for cloud and cloudlet. At both levels, there is the need for: (a) strong isolation between untrusted user-level computations; (b) mechanisms for authentication, access control, and metering; (c) dynamic resource allocation for user-level computations; and, (d) the ability to support a very wide range of user-level computations, with minimal restrictions on their process structure, programming languages or operating systems. At a cloud datacenter, these requirements are met today using the virtual machine (VM) abstraction. For the same reasons they are used in cloud computing today, VMs are used as an abstraction for cloudlets. Meanwhile, there are a few but important differentiators between cloud and cloudlet. Rapid provisioning Different from cloud data centers that are optimized for launching existing VM images in their storage tier, cloudlets need to be much more agile in their provisioning. Their association with mobile devices is highly dynamic, with considerable churn due to user mobility. A user from far away may unexpectedly show up at a cloudlet (e.g., if he just got off an international flight) and try to use it for an application such as a personalized language translator. For that user, the provisioning delay before he is able to use the application impacts usability. VM handoff across cloudlets If a mobile device user moves away from the cloudlet he is currently using, the interactive response will degrade as the logical network distance increases. To address this effect of user mobility, the offloaded services on the first cloudlet need to be transferred to the second cloudlet maintaining end-to-end network quality. This resembles live migration in cloud computing but differs considerably in a sense that the VM handoff happens in Wide Area Network (WAN). OpenStack++ Since the cloudlet model requires reconfiguration or additional deployment of hardware/software, it is important to provide a systematic way to incentivise the deployment. However, it can face a classic bootstrapping problem. Cloudlets need practical applications to incentivize cloudlet deployment. However, developers cannot heavily rely on cloudlet infrastructure until it is widely deployed. To break this deadlock and bootstrap the cloudlet deployment, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University proposed OpenStack++ that extends OpenStack to leverage its open ecosystem. OpenStack++ provides a set of cloudlet-specific API as OpenStack extensions. Commercial implementations and standardization effort By 2015 cloudlet based applications were commercially available. In 2017 the National Institute of Standards and Technology published draft standards for fog computing in which cloudlets were defined as nodes on the fog architecture.

The Towpath parallels the Manayunk Canal and the Schuylkill River. The Towpath is accessible from Fairmount Park to the East and from the Schuylkill River Trail to the West. As the Towpath runs through heavy industry and rural-like settings, its surface varies between boardwalk, gravel, and pavement. This makes the Towpath ideal for running, walking, and cycling. Fishing in the Schuylkill Canal along the Manayunk Towpath is a favorite past time for visitors and residents alike. Visible along the Towpath are rail lines, old canal locks, ruins of the lock tender's house and old textile mills. Plentiful wildlife thrives along the Manayunk Canal Towpath including many species of birds, fish, turtles, and native plants. The Manayunk Development Corporation is currently organizing a full restoration of the Manayunk Canal; once the restoration is complete, it will be possible for canoes and small boats to sail through the Manayunk Canal Towpath as they make their way down the Schuylkill River.

A machine tool monitoring system is a flow of information and system processing in which the information selection, obtaining data, processing of information and decision making on the refined information are integrated. The aim of tool condition monitoring is to detect early the disturbances in the machining process and wear of machine tool components. The condition of tool has been researched extensively in the past and have focused on detection of tool wear, tool breakage and the estimation of remaining tool life. It is very important for on-line identification of tool condition in machining process for enhanced productivity, better quality of parts and lower costs for unmanned, automated manufacturing systems.  Techniques of machine tool monitoring  Machine tool monitoring can be done with or without additional sensors. Using additional sensors, monitoring can be done by measuring: * the cutting force (with a multi-channel table dynamometer or rotating dynamometer) * vibration amplitude using multi-channel accelerometers * audible sound from the machining process * high-frequency sound or acoustic emission Sensor-less machine tool monitoring is done by measuring internal drive signals such as: * feed motor current * spindle motor current * spindle power Combined measuring of multiple quantities is also possible.  Acoustic emission sensor  Machine tool monitoring is explained with Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors. An AE sensor is commonly defined as the sound emitted as an elastic wave by a solid when it is deformed or struck, caused by the rapid release of localized stress energy. Therefore, it is an occurrence phenomenon which releases elastic energy into the material, which then propagates as an elastic wave. The detection frequency range of acoustic emission is from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. Rapid stress-releasing events generate a spectrum of stress waves starting at 0 Hz and typically falling off at several MHz. AE can be related to an irreversible release of energy. It can also be generated from sources not involving material failure including friction, cavitation and impact. The three major applications of AE sensors phenomena are: a) Source location - determine the locations of occurrence of an event b) Material mechanical performance - evaluate and characterize materials/structures; and c Health monitoring – monitors the safety operation.  How an AE sensor monitors machine tool An AE sensor works on the principle of measuring the high- frequency energy signals produced during cutting process. It also measures the AE energy resulting from the fracture when a tool breaks. It is best suited to applications where the level of background AE signal is low compared to the sound of tool breakage. This makes the AE sensor ideal for breakage detection of small drills and taps. It is easy to install on both new and existing machines. An AE sensor detects force proportional monitoring signals even in machining operations, which generate very small cutting forces. In combination with true power, it increases the reliability of breakage monitoring. It is used especially with solid carbide tools, or very small tools on large machines and multi spindles. Most of the sensors have to be attached to the machine tool surface. However, there are alternative methods of AE wave transmitting. A rotating, wireless AE sensor consists of a rotating sensor and a fixed receiver. An AE sensor can also receive the acoustic waves via a jet of cooling lubricant, which can be connected directly to the tool or workpiece. The machine tool monitoring systems commonly use sensors for measuring cutting force components or quantities related to cutting force (power, torque, distance/displacement and strain). AE sensors are relatively easy to install in existing or new machines, and do not influence machine integrity and stiffness. All systems suppliers also use acoustic emission sensors, especially for monitoring small tools and for grinding. All sensors used in machine tool monitoring systems are well adjusted to harsh machine tool environments. The difficulties in designing reliable machine tool monitoring can be related to the complexity of the machining process itself, which may have one or more of the following characteristics, apart from the changes of the machine tool itself.

He was part of the first generation of black opera singers to achieve success and is viewed as part of an instrumental group of performers who helped break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world. In 2000 he was the recipient of the Legacy Award by the National Opera Association, an award given annually to recognize the contributions made by African-American artists to opera in America. Life and career Born in Columbia, Tennessee, Frierson was raised in Kentucky. He earned degrees in vocal performance from the Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School, and has taught on the voice faculties of Southern University and Oberlin College. At Juilliard he studied voice with Belle Julie Soudant; the teacher of opera singers Frances Bible and Gloria Davy. In his early career he was a member of The Belafonte Folk Singers with whom he performed and made recordings both with and without Harry Belafonte. Frierson made his professional opera debut in 1958 as Cal in Marc Blitzstein's Regina with the New York City Opera; a role which he also recorded with the NYCO on disc for Sony. He continued to perform with the NYCO for the next six consecutive seasons, portraying such roles as Henry Davis in Street Scene, the King in Aida, the Messenger/the Shepherd in Oedipus rex, Schlémil / Wolfram/ Hermann in The Tales of Hoffmann, and the title role in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. In 1960 Frierson performed the role of Don Alfonso in Così fan tutte with the Chautauqua Opera; notably touring with that production to Bermuda. In 1961 he portrayed Joe in the New York City Center revival of Jerome Kern's Show Boat opposite Jo Sullivan Loesser as Magnolia, Anita Darian as Julie, Robert Rounseville as Gaylord, and Carol Brice as Queenie. He notably sang the song Ol' Man River on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1975 he appeared jointly with his wife, soprano Billie Lynn Daniel, in recital at Alice Tully Hall. In 1980 he performed the role of Cal in the Houston Grand Opera production of Regina. Frierson and Daniel's daughter, actress Andrea Frierson, married actor Jesse D. Goins in 1977.

The family then moved to London, where Steil continued writing her second book, a novel, and worked as a freelance journalist. While there, her work included a long piece on Yemen for the World Policy Journal, a Yemen piece for the German paper Die Welt, and stories on Kate & Will’s royal wedding, London’s 9/11 monument, and British politics for the Washington Times. Steil has given talks and readings all over the world. Since 2010, she has spoken in Algeria, New York, Seattle, Dubai, Amsterdam, The Hague, Egypt, Boston, Abu Dhabi, Vermont, and London. She moved with her family to Bolivia in September 2012 and to Uzbekistan in 2019. Their daughter Theadora Celeste Steil Torlot was born November 13, 2009.
