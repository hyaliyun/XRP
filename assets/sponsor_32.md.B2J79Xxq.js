Literally translated from Malayalam, it means 'the beach (Thura) besides the church (Palli). Although most churches in this region where beside the Arabian Sea, the etymology is significant because Pallitura is one of the places where St. Francis Xavier established a church. This church has now been transformed to the space museum of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. The villagers of Pallithura are now famous for their sacrifice in 1962 of most of their village for creating the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS), which was the basis for the formation of Indian Space Research Organization. The revival of interest in the history of Pallithura resulted as a result of President Abdul Kalam's mentioning of it in his books and speeches. Location The location of Pallithura can be specified based on the time in question: before and after the formation of TERLS. Till the formation of TERLS, Pallithura bordered Veli in the south, Kulathoor in the east, and Kochuthura in the north. The Parvathy Puthannaar canal formed the border with Kulathoor. Due to this vast expanse making the then Pallithura one of the biggest parishes in the diocese. After the formation of TERLS, Parvathy Puthanar Canal become the east and VSSC Housing Colony on South same way Arabian Sea on west and KINFRA Industrial Area on North. Pallithura of 1960s Based on the rehabilitation agreement with the government of India, a model village was to be rebuilt to its southern border. The villagers are of Latin Catholic faith and hence a large church which was a priority was built. A primary school was built to facilitate basic education. The houses were neatly built single bedroom on ten-cents of land consisting of a kitchen, patio, and a living room. They were aligned in thirteen parallel lanes, with sixteen houses (eight on each side) on a lane. A state-of-the-art water supply and distribution system was the attraction providing water for the entire village through two public taps in each lane. A police check-post was formed to maintain order in case people were not very comfortable with the packed nature of their new neighbourhood. A public transport main road with a designated bus stop provided access to the city. In order to aid the villagers who were dependent on the sea for their livelihood, an ice-plant and fish processing centre was built. For entertainment, a radio-kiosk was built and land was set-aside for resting at evenings. A market-place and a medical clinic was built at the centre of the village.

A boma is a livestock enclosure, community enclosure, stockade, corral, small fort or a district government office and community used in many parts of the African Great Lakes region, as well as Central and Southern Africa. It is particularly associated with community decision making. It is incorporated into many African languages, as well as colonial varieties of English, French and German. As a livestock enclosure, a boma is the equivalent of kraal. The former term is used in areas influenced by the Swahili language, and the latter is employed in areas influenced by Afrikaans. In the form of fortified villages or camps, bomas were commonplace in Central Africa in the 18th and 19th century. They were commonplace throughout Africa, including in areas affected by the slave trade, tribal wars and colonial conquest, and were built and used by both sides. thorny acacia branches in a rural village in Isiolo County, Kenya in 2018. Apart from the neatly built stockades shown in illustrations of bomas, the term, in practice, more often resembled the structure shown in the illustration accompanying this article. In that form, they often were referred to by the likes of J. A. Hunter and Henry Morton Stanley. Alternate use In British colonies, especially in remote areas, boma came to be used to mean government offices because in the late 19th century such offices usually included a fortified police station or military barracks, often in the form of a timber stockade, though some had stone walls. Many were called forts, as in 'Fort Jameson', 'Fort Manning', or 'Fort Rosebery'. In the 20th century it came to mean the district or provincial government headquarters, even where fortifications were no longer required.‚ÄúMemories of Abandoned Bomas - No. 11: Old Ndola‚Äù. The Northern Rhodesia Journal, Vol III No 3 (1957) pp 200-205. Boma is still commonly used in the African Great Lakes and Southern Africa with this meaning, along with the definition of a livestock enclosure. Etymology and acronym debunking Ambushing lions: \\"The lion can not get into the boma unless he jumps up and comes in from the top. It is the function of the hunter to prevent this strategic man≈ìuver by killing the lion before he gets in. If he does not, he is likely to find himself engaged in a spirited hand-to-hand fight with an unfriendly lion in a space about as big as the upper berth of a sleeping-car.\\" - John T. McCutcheon, cartoonist for the Chicago Tribune, 1910. A popular myth told to tourists in the African Great Lakes states that BOMA stood for 'British Overseas Management Administration' or 'British Officers Mess Area' during the colonial era in Africa. The myth holds that the term has since been adopted into Swahili and several other vernacular Bantu languages of former British East Africa (for example, Chichewa and Chitumbuka in Malawi) to mean government in general, or locations of governmental offices, such as district centers. In fact, the word boma has much deeper roots in languages spoken in the Africa Great Lakes, whether as a word of Bantu origin or a loan word from Persian. The Oxford English Dictionary ascribes the first use to the adventurer Henry Morton Stanley, in his book Through the Dark Continent (1878): 'From the staked bomas..there rise to my hearing the bleating of young calves.' The term is also used throughout Stanley's earlier book How I found Livingstone(1871) '...we pitched our camp, built a boma of thorny acacia, and other tree branches, by stacking them round our camp...' Krapf's A Dictionary of the Suahili Language (1882) defines boma as 'a palisade or stockade serving as a kind of fortification to towns and villages...may consist of stones or poles, or of an impenetrable thicket of thorns,' though he does not give an origin for the word. Boma also appears in Band's 'Deutsches Kolonial-Lexikon' (1920), which indicates the word was in use in Tanganyika long before it fell under the control of the British. Johnson's Standard Swahili-English Dictionary (1939) suggests boma comes from a Persian word, buum, which he says means 'garrison, place where one can dwell in safety.' In Swahili and Sabaki: A Linguistic History, Nurse and Hinnebusch (1993) give iboma, 'defended area,' as either a Great Lakes Bantu innovation or a borrowing from Persian (p. 295). At any rate, the word was in circulation before any British 'overseas management' of the coast, although the acronym is clever. Maasai boma in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area in Tanzania. Moreover, no such entity as the 'British Overseas Management Administration' ever existed. The UK Government's responsibility for the development of its colonies on a continuing basis was first recognised in 1929 by the Colonial Development Act. In 1961 a Department of Technical Co-operation was established to deal with the technical co- operation side of the aid programme. The Ministry of Overseas Development was first set up as a separate ministry in October 1964, headed by a Minister of Overseas Development. It brought together the functions of the former Department of Technical Co-operation and the overseas aid policy functions of the Foreign, Commonwealth Relations and Colonial Offices and of other government departments. Great Britain's bilateral aid agency was called the 'Overseas Development Administration' (ODA) from 1970 until it was renamed the Department for International Development (DFID) in 1997.

The episode was written by Richard Price from a story by David Simon & Richard Price and was directed by Steve Shill. It originally aired on September 26, 2004. Synopsis McNulty visits medical examiner Randall Frazier, skeptical that D'Angelo Barksdale's death in prison was a suicide. Frazier reports that D'Angelo's death could have been a homicide, citing bruises on his neck and back. McNulty visits D'Angelo's ex- girlfriend Donette, who doesn't tell him anything. Meanwhile, Cheese executes his dog when it loses in a dogfight. Soon afterwards, Tri, a drug dealer attending the dogfight, approaches and kills another dealer named Jelly. The MCU hears chatter about the murder over the wire, assuming a gang war has erupted. Daniels and the Major Case Unit want to make arrests for the murders, but McNulty argues that they should gather more evidence in the hope of ultimately bringing down Bell. The unit arrests Cheese's crew as they prepare to retaliate for Jelly's murder. Under questioning, Cheese admits to killing his dog not a person as the detectives assumed meaning he can't be charged. The following day, the MCU finds that their wiretaps have gone dead. While patrolling the Western, Herc and Carver pick up Poot. Herc, Carver and Kenneth Dozerman go to the movies with their girlfriends, where they are mortified to bump into Poot, Bodie, and Puddin with their dates. Later, Dozerman is non- fatally shot while undercover, and his gun is stolen. The next day, Colvin tells his men that he is suspending all undercover narcotics work, likening the War on Drugs to Prohibition. Back out on the street, Herc cannot understand Colvin's reasoning. Omar and his crew stick up Shamrock and Country while they collect money for a drug resupply. Bell visits Avon in prison and reveals his plan to supply other dealers. Avon asks Bell to target specific high turnover areas, but Bell expresses reluctance to use violence to maintain their street cred.

Probably born in London, he became a lawyer in Maryland, then a British colony, where he wrote a number of poems including one which some scholars consider the first American satire: \\"The Sotweed Factor, or A Voyage to Maryland, A Satyr\\" (1708). He was fictionalized by John Barth as the comically innocent protagonist of The Sot-Weed Factor, a novel in which a series of fantastic misadventures leads Cooke to write his poem. Life Little is known about the life of Cook (sometimes spelled \\"Cooke\\", but spelled Cook in his published works). It is known that Cooke, like the persona of his poem, voyaged to Maryland as a young man. He entered the bar of Prince George's County, Maryland, and practiced law before returning to London by 1694. He later returned to Maryland after inheriting a half interest in his father's estate at Malden, Maryland. (archive) Almost all that is known about Cooke was discovered by Lawrence C. Wroth and published in the introduction to a facsimile edition of The Maryland Muse, (1934, originally published 1730). Building on the few historical references, Wroth theorized that Cooke's grandfather, Andrew Cooke, came to Maryland in 1661 and bought several pieces of property, including a place called \\"Malden\\", later called \\"Cooke's Point\\". Cooke's father, also named Andrew, married a woman named Anne in England in 1664. Wroth guesses Ebenezer was born the next year. Based on the poem, Ebenezer attended Cambridge University and came to Maryland in 1694. He returned to England before \\"The Sot‚ÄìWeed Factor\\" was published in 1708 in London. He probably remained in England until after his father's will was probated in 1711‚Äì12 and returned to Maryland before 1717. A poem eulogizing the Hon. Nicholas Lowe was published in the Maryland Gazette in December 1728, signed by \\"E. C. Laureat\\", and a poem called \\"Sot-Weed Redivivus\\", signed by \\"E. C. Gent\\", was published in 1730 by William Parks in Annapolis. Cooke died sometime after 1732, the date of publication of the last work signed \\"Ebenezer Cooke\\". \\"The Sot-Weed Factor\\" was reprinted in 1865 by Brantz Mayer, who called \\"the adventures and manners described ludicrous and certainly very unpolished\\". One of Cooke's admirers was Moses Coit Tyler, who praised \\"The Sot-Weed Factor\\" in his History of American Literature (1878), saying it struck \\"a vein of genuine and powerful satire\\"; Tyler cited a few dozen lines from the poem, and added that \\"Sot-Weed Redivivus\\" lacks the first poem's wit. Cooke's work, mostly forgotten, was brought out of obscurity by Bernard Christian Steiner, who in 1900 published Early Maryland poetry, a volume of Cooke's poetry which contained the two \\"Sot-Weed Factor\\" poems, the \\"Elegy Upon Nicholas Lowe, Esq.\\", and another early Maryland poem by an unknown author, \\"The Mousetrap\\". \\"The Sot-Weed Factor\\" Written in Hudibrastic couplets, the poem is, on its surface, a scathing Juvenalian satire of America and its colonists, and a parody of the pamphlets that advertised colonization as easy and lucrative (38, 40). The persona comes to Maryland as a tobacco merchant, or \\"sot-weed factor\\". He is shocked by the brutishness of Native Americans and English settlers alike, and he is swindled by an \\"ambodexter quack\\", or corrupt lawyer. He leaves the colony in disgust.

Holding sway over a Russophile faction within the Wallachian boyardom, he briefly served as an officer in Russia's Imperial Army during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774. P√¢rvu was a member of the Cantacuzino family, which made him a descendant of several Wallachian Princes, and was joined in all of his political and military actions by his younger brother, the Vistier Mihai. Helping Pyotr Rumyantsev and Nazary Alexandrovych Karazin in their occupation of Bucharest, the Cantacuzinos also arrested Grigore III Ghica; in the aftermath, P√¢rvu served as civilian governor of Wallachia. He commanded a part of the Wallachian military forces, assisting against the Ottoman army on the road to Giurgiu. He and his soldiers were ambushed and killed on the way to Comana Monastery, where P√¢rvu was buried. His Cantacuzino branch, headed by Mihai, survived mostly in exile, joining the ranks of Russian nobility and calling for Wallachia's annexation to Russia. It included P√¢rvu's nephew Ioan Cantacuzino, the poet and politician, who returned for a while to take over as leader of the Russophile faction. The Russophiles maintained a presence in Wallachian politics to ca. 1800, but frictions between the Empire and the boyars pushed the party a steady decline. Biography=Origins and rise The Cantacuzinos were a family of Greek refugees, though probably related, through their patriarch Andronikos Kantakouzenos, with the local late-16th-century Prince, Michael the Brave.Djuvara, pp. 28, 336‚Äì337; Stoicescu, pp. 41, 64, 136 Their exact relationship with the original Kantakouzenos, from whom they claimed descent, remains disputed.Djuvara, p. 337 P√¢rvu and Mihai descended directly from DrƒÉghici Cantacuzino, brother of »òerban Cantacuzino, who was Prince in the 1680s, and of the scholar-politician Constantin II.Rezachevici II, p. 45; Rizo-Rangab√©, pp. 18, 22‚Äì23, 26; Stoicescu, pp. 135‚Äì145 DrƒÉghici, his brother »òerban, and their father, Constantin I Cantacuzino had been involved in various schemes during the 1650s and '60s, culminating in open conflict with Prince Grigore I Ghica. The latter ordered Constantin I hanged at Snagov Monastery, and mutilated »òerban.Stoicescu, pp. 135‚Äì137. See also Djuvara, p. 336; Rezachevici I, pp. 14‚Äì15; Rizo-Rangab√©, p. 18 This prompted DrƒÉghici to take refuge in Istanbul. He died there in 1667, either from the plague outbreak or (as it was rumored) from poison administered by the boyar Nicula Sofialiul.Stoicescu, pp. 137‚Äì138 Through this connection, P√¢rvu was also a maternal descendant of Prince Radu »òerban and of the high-ranking courtier Diicul Buicescul.Stoicescu, pp. 135, 137. See also Djuvara, p. 28; Rezachevici II, p. 45; Rizo-Rangab√©, pp. 20, 22; TƒÉnase & Muscariu, p. 248 P√¢rvu hailed from the \\"MƒÉgureanu\\" Cantacuzinos, whose origin is traced to one of DrƒÉghici's sons, also named P√¢rvu (or P√¢rvu II). This prominent boyar and diplomat under several Princes married Ilinca, daughter of Mare»ô BƒÉjescu, the Ban of Oltenia.Rizo-Rangab√©, pp. 22‚Äì23. See also Stoicescu, pp. 110, 144 The couple's youngest son, Matei, also served as Ban in 1735‚Äì1740. From his marriage to the boyaress Pagona Rustea, with whom he had a daughter, Maria, and four sons, of whom P√¢rvu III was second.Rizo-Rangab√©, pp. 22‚Äì23 Constantin, the eldest, left for Moldavia in 1733, establishing a Cantacuzino branch there before his death in 1761.Rizo-Rangab√©, p. 23 Remaining in Wallachia, P√¢rvu, Mihai and their youngest brother, RƒÉducanu,Iorga, p. 213; Rizo-Rangab√©, p. 23 went on to occupy high offices of the court. The Cantacuzino brothers' political ascendancy came at the height of a Phanariote regime, when Princes were directly appointed by, and subservient to, the Sublime Porte. According to historian Neagu Djuvara, the Cantacuzinos were technically Phanariotes, but emphasized their matrilineal connection to the House of Basarab. As such, they \\"would soon come to lead a 'national party', one hostile to the growing influence of the Greeks\\".Djuvara, p. 28 P√¢rvu III's first contribution to the Wallachian military forces came during Constantine Mavrocordatos' third reign (1735‚Äì1741). He was ordered to take up arms during the 1737 campaign against Russia; in fact, the army's role was to intervene between the Bucharest populace and the Ottoman army, policing against pillage and rape.Iorga, p. 215 He was at the time married to Maria, daughter of a Moldavian boyar, Andronic Palade, but became a widower in 1741.Rizo-Rangab√©, p. 23 By 1759, P√¢rvu had married Elena (or Eleni) Hrisoscoleu, making him in-laws with Serdar Canache.Cornelia Bodea, Paul Cernovodeanu, Horia Nestorescu-BƒÉlce»ôti, Vatra BƒÉlce»ôtilor.

He married a third and final time to another Palade boyaress, Esmeralda.Rizo-Rangab√©, p. 23 By 1761, with Mavrocordatos again on the throne, P√¢rvu was serving as the highest-ranking Logothete. In October of that year, he and his relative, the Medelnicer Toma Cantacuzino, exchanged property in Bucharest, making P√¢rvu owner of the \\"parental homes\\" in »òerban-VodƒÉ mahala‚Äîlocated outside Lipscani, and named after their ancestor, the Prince.Giurescu, p. 357 He went on to serve command offices in the military, as Great Spatharios and then as Oltenian Ban.TƒÉnase & Muscariu, p. 248.

After the Russo-Turkish War began in October 1768, P√¢rvu and his brother formed a group of pro-Russian boyars in Bucharest. Their connection with the Russians was a Polkovnik Nazary Alexandrovych Karazin (father of Vasyl Karazin).Giurescu, p. 98; Lapedatu, p. 21; P√¢rvu, pp. 68‚Äì69; Taki, pp. 8, 47 While engaged in this conspiracy, P√¢rvu still enjoyed Ghica's trust, and, early in the war, was confirmed as Ban and Spatharios of the Wallachian army.P√¢rvu, p. 69; VƒÉcƒÉrescu & »òtrempel, p. 101 Karazin presented the Cantacuzinos with a manifesto by Catherine the Great, the Empress of All Russia, promising to free the Danubian Principalities and the Balkans from the \\"barbarians' domination\\".P√¢rvu, p. 69 By then, the \\"Russian\\" party was also supported by burghers and commoners, who resented the Phanariote and Ottoman fiscal policies.Giurescu, p. 98 These, alongside boyars who embraced the cause of \\"Holy Rus\\", numbered in the thousands‚Äîaccording to Djuvara, some 12,000 men from Wallachia and Moldavia migrated to Russia and joined the imperial army.Djuvara, p. 285 In January 1769, with the Russians having taken Moldavia, the Orthodox Church of Wallachia sent a letter to the Empress, asking for their country to be occupied as well.Taki, p. 47 At around that same date, Catherine wrote to Cantacuzino personally. Her reply referred to the Wallachians as a \\"Slavic people\\"‚Äîaccording to historian Nicolae Iorga and political scientist Dumitru Th. P√¢rvu, hers is the earliest record of Pan- Slavism being tested on the locals.P√¢rvu, p. 69 For several months, Karazin's mixed force did not venture out of Moldavia, and remained based at Foc»ôani.Lapedatu, p. 21 Bucharest was pacified by the Ottomans during spring 1769, when the Ottoman army again set up a direct presence. Following its acts of violence against Bucharest civilians, and aware that the Turkish garrison was undermanned, P√¢rvu created his own volunteer army of Romanians and Arnavutlar (Albanians), joined by some of Karazin's Zaporozhian Cossacks; in the early hours of November 16, these troops ambushed the Ottomans and arrested Prince Grigore.Giurescu, p. 98; Taki, pp. 8, 47. See also Lapedatu, p. 22; TƒÉnase & Muscariu, p. 248; VƒÉcƒÉrescu & »òtrempel, pp. LVIII, 101‚Äì102 Some 5,000 Ottoman soldiers were chased out of the capital, but only as far as Giurgiu, where they recuperated.Lapedatu, p. 22 Following this move, a group of Wallachian boyars addressed Catherine a letter in which they asked for Wallachia to be annexed as a guberniya.Taki, pp. 8, 47 Genealogist Eug√®ne Rizo-Rangab√© further notes that P√¢rvu was made the civilian \\"Governor of Wallachia\\" by General Pyotr Rumyantsev.Rizo-Rangab√©, p. 23 P√¢rvu then appealed to his in-law, IenƒÉchi»õƒÉ VƒÉcƒÉrescu, who was to obtain for him the submission of the Boyar Council. VƒÉcƒÉrescu was dispatched to BuzƒÉu County, but used the opportunity to cross the border into neutral Transylvania; as he recalled in his memoirs, he felt pressured by Karazin, and would not commit themselves to the Cantacuzino's unreserved Russophilia.VƒÉcƒÉrescu & »òtrempel, pp. LVIII, 101‚Äì105 Reportedly, the Cantacuzinos hoped that P√¢rvu would take over Ghica's throne. This created additional frictions between the boyars, since VƒÉcƒÉrescu wanted the throne for himself.VƒÉcƒÉrescu & »òtrempel, pp. XXIII, LVII‚ÄìLVIII Fortifications of Comana Monastery A number of setbacks followed the early Russian victory. The Ottomans camped at Giurgiu began marching on Bucharest; Karazin's volunteers, sent to meet them, were defeated and had to barricade themselves in Comana Monastery.Lapedatu, p. 23; TƒÉnase & Muscariu, p. 248 Placed in command of a small Russian detachment and a unit of Verzi»ôori (Wallachian J√§ger),LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 23, 221 P√¢rvu Cantacuzino promised to relieve them; he was ambushed by Ottoman troops in VlƒÉsiei forest, outside Comana. He was killed in battle alongside all his men, including a Russian Major by the name of AndrehGiurescu, p. 98; Lapedatu, p. 23; Rezachevici II, p. 45; TƒÉnase & Muscariu, p. 248 and the Verzi»ôori Captain »òerban LƒÉcusteanu.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 23 Some 1,000 soldiers are believed to have been killed on the anti-Ottoman side.TƒÉnase & Muscariu, p. 248 However, the Comana ambush became a Russian tactical victory: the Ottoman soldiers, believing that they would not be able to confront a stream of Russian new arrivals, backed out of the confrontation and returned to Giurgiu.Lapedatu, p. 23 P√¢rvu's body was recovered by his followers and taken to the nearby monastery. Although the latter had been damaged during the fighting,TƒÉnase & Muscariu, pp. 248‚Äì249 it was incidentally a traditional Cantacuzino burial site. P√¢rvu's remains were placed in the tomb of his maternal ancestor, Radu »òerban.Rezachevici II, p. 45 Legacy A new Ottoman- appointed Prince, Emanuel Giani Ruset, tried to occupy Bucharest at various intervals from January 1770, ultimately succeeding in June, when the Russians operated a strategic retreat; in August, a large-scale Ottoman defeat at Kagul led to a Russian return, and to the peace of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca.Giurescu, pp. 98‚Äì99 Mihai Cantacuzino was involved in the negotiations, addressing a memorandum in which he outlined the Wallachian grievances and demanded the preservation of autonomy from Ottoman rule, claiming that it had been codified by medieval Capitulations.Taki, pp. 10‚Äì13, 52‚Äì53 The resulting treaty gave Russia sweeping powers of intervention in Wallachian public life, and also offered a general amnesty to Russian favorites, who were allowed to preserve their mobile wealth but had to leave the country. The latter clause was used by Mihai, who settled in Russia,Giurescu, p. 99 becoming a Major General and an avid campaigner for the Russian annexation of Wallachia and Moldavia.Iorga, p. 213 By 1775, he had donated his immobile estate for charity, establishing a Romanian-language school on the grounds of Livedea VƒÉcƒÉrescului (Filaret) Church, Bucharest.Florescu, p. 585 Mihai died in exile in 1790, having been recognized as an imperial prince. He had four daughters, one of whom had married Alexey, son of Pyotr Melissino.Rizo-Rangab√©, pp. 23‚Äì24 In some records, RƒÉducanu appears as having died serving in the war;Iorga, p. 213; Ursu, p. 181 other sources note his fleeing to the Russian side, and then with his brother to Russia, where he became a Polkovnik.Levit, p. 31; Rizo-Rangab√©, p. 24 Their two sons, Nicolae and Ioan Cantacuzino, also took flight and were educated at Russian military schools.Iorga, p. 213; Levit, p. 31; Rizo- Rangab√©, p. 24; Ursu, p. 181 Also joining them was a Moldavian, Theodorache Bal»ô, who had married P√¢rvu's daughter Maria in 1770 or 1774.

Technology Dauglish earned his medical degree at Edinburgh. Having been thoroughly unimpressed by the Scottish bread of the day, he began to make his own, and to study the science associated with the process. When he applied his earlier studies in chemistry to the process of bread making, he determined that it would be possible to produce carbonic acid gas in bread without yeast. He established that if one could instead introduce carbon dioxide to the process‚Äîby dissolving it into solution in the water‚Äîthis would eliminate the need for fermentation, dramatically reduce the need for physical contact with the dough on the part of the workers, and consequently introduce a greater level of cleanliness into the bread-making process. Dauglish sought to abolish manual kneading, which he believed was unclean and unhealthy. Some years later, an 1878 issue of the scientific journal, Nature, reported: > As to the perfect cleanliness of this mechanical process for making bread > there can be no question; it is immeasurably superior to the barbarous and > old, but as Dr. Richardson remarked, not \\"time-honoured system of kneading > dough by the hands and feet of the workman\\".Church, A. H. ‚ÄúAerated Bread,\\" > Nature. Volume XIX, 26 December 1878. p. 174-175. Such a system would also lend itself to a high degree of automation. This method thus leavens bread, without yeast, by forcing carbon dioxide into the dough under pressure. A patent for the new method of bread making was granted in 1856. In 1859 Dauglish presented a paper on his new method to the Royal Society of Arts, for which he received a silver medal. Also, Dauglish's method received endorsements from various Victorian-era physicians and sanitarians helping to further cement the future success of his endeavour. Moreover, because it was considered a healthy bread, it was introduced into many hospitals. In 1862 the Aerated Bread Company was set up to exploit Dauglish's newly patented method. Dauglish described his technique as avoiding the \\"destructive influence of fermentation\\", and claimed that the bread contained \\"all the gluten and all the albuminous food of the wheat\\", each of which is diminished in quantity under traditional fermentation methods. A further benefit of the process is that, unlike with the traditional fermentation method, additives like alum never have to be added to slow the rate of fermentation, leading Richardson to term Aerated bread \\"additive-free\\". The 1878 issue of Nature reported that > The stream of pure water charged with carbonic acid gas vesiculates the > dough, which has required neither alum, nor blue vitriol [copper sulphate], > nor lime-water, to check the irregular fermentation, and neutralise the > sourness of mouldy or otherwise damaged or inferior flour. However, the journal went on to say that aerated bread is not entirely additive-free inasmuch as some minor, less objectionable additives are sometimes still introduced to the process: > [T]he adoption of the aerating process does not of itself necessarily > exclude all adulterations of the bread: materials to whiten the loaf and to > cause the retention of a larger percentage of water may still be used. The aeration method accrues to the bakery three production economies: material savings, time savings, and labour savings. As an illustration of the first of these economies, Dauglish estimated that, by eliminating the decomposition of the starches and gluten that occur from traditional fermentation (a loss equal to between three and six percent), this had a value in the middle of the 19th century of \\"¬£5,000,000 in the total quantity of bread made, annually, in the United Kingdom\\" (¬£ in current terms).O‚ÄôDonoghue, Jim and Louise Goulding. \\"Consumer Price Inflation since 1750,\\" Economic Trends. No. 604, March 2004. pp. 38‚Äì46. (Retrieved 2009-06-25.) The process is a highly automated one, and thus saves time and reduces labour costs. Whereas the traditional dough fermentation method required between eight and ten hours to ready a batch of dough for baking, the Dauglish method has dough ready for the ovens in approximately half an hour. And since the bread dough is ready for the ovens so quickly, the daily hours worked can be reduced, obviating the need for the night shifts that were so prevalent in the baking industry at the time. Finally, not needing most additives otherwise required to enhance the fermentation process reduces the cost of factor inputs while producing a virtually unadulterated product. The technology so reduced the cost of production, that it meant that A.B.C. could sell its product for less than its competitors, the traditional fermentation method bakers. The downward impact on prices of A.B.C. moving into a market could be felt almost immediately. For example, in 1866 Australia, A.B.C.'s lower prices forced other bakers to reduce theirs by between 8 and 17 percent.\\"Dear Meat\\",\\" The Adelaide Observer. As reprinted in The Brisbane Courier. Tuesday, 6 February 1866, p. 3. (Retrieved 2009-05-09). via trove.nla.gov.au Competition from A.B.C. had more than just a price effect on the traditional fermentation bakers, who responded, in some instances, with unusual advertising efforts to retain market share. The traditional fermentation process produces alcohol within the dough, though virtually all of it dissipates in the extreme heat of the ovens. To counter the success of aerated bread in the market, traditional fermentation bakers began focusing on this in their advertising. To that end, placard advertisements were used‚Äîespecially in the neighbourhood of the A.B.C. factory‚Äîurging people to \\"buy the bread with the gin in it\\", at a time when gin was thought to have medicinal properties as it was made from juniper berries. Richardson's great support of aerated bread at the expense of traditionally baked bread has been suggested to have been motivated by his dislike of alcohol. A.B.C.'s first bakery was in Islington, London. In the late Victorian-era, the Dauglish method was considered the superior system by which to mass produce bread. In his memoir of the method, Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson, a later director of the company,\\"Our Industries\\", The Brisbane Courier. Friday, 27 December 1895. p. 6. Recounting business news from The Times of London.(Retrieved 2009-05-09 trove.nla.gov.au.) wrote: > I am convinced, from careful and prolonged observation, that the Dauglish > method of bread manufacture is on the whole the best that has been > discovered ‚Ä¶ [I]t is the cleanliest of all the processes known and > followed; it calls for less drudgery, and, it is not unjust to say, less > objectionable labour, from the employed in bread manufacture; it inflicts > less arduous toil, and so lessens the rapid wearing out of the body, which > is an unfortunate fate of many of those who are engaged in the manufacture > of the staff of life; it supplies a purer article to those who depend, > largely, upon the staff of life for their daily aliment.

(Retrieved 2009-05-08) After Dauglish had spent four years introducing his bread-making system his health worsened; this has been said to be due to the labour and excitement involved, and he visited various health resorts throughout Europe. In 1865 he became seriously ill in Paris; he returned to the U.K. and died at Malvern in early 1866. He is buried at Malvern Wells. Thirty years after Dauglish's death, his company was thriving. As a result of its market success, A.B.C.'s shares were trading at 12 times their initial public offering price and, at its 1895 annual general meeting, it was stated by the presiding officer, Major John Bolton, that A.B.C. \\"had no reason to fear competition\\". The Dauglish method survived its creator, and Dauglish's company survived him by well over a century, but his method was later superseded by the adoption of mechanical, high-speed dough processes such as the Chorleywood Bread Process (CBP), now used for 80 percent of UK bread production. These newer methods permit the use of lower-grade flours than were required by earlier processes.Lawrence, Felicity. Not on the Label: What Really Goes into the Food on Your Plate. Penguin. 2004.Whitley, Andrew. Bread Matters: The State of Modern Bread and a Definitive Guide to Baking Your Own. Fourth Estate. 2006. Tea shops and early women's issues A.B.C. operated a chain of self-service A.B.C. tea shops. These grew from A.B.C. opening a tearoom in the courtyard of London's Fenchurch Street Railway Station in 1864, two years after the company's founding.\\"Tea Rooms: A shop infused with classic tradition\\",\\" The Evening Telegraph. 25 August 2005. (Retrieved 2009-05-08). The idea for opening the tearoom is attributed to a London-based manager of the Aerated Bread Company who had been serving free tea and snacks to customers.Brandt, Pamela Robin. \\"Tea for View, View for Tea,\\" Miami New Times. 17 October 2002.

The motivation for the company acting upon the manager's suggestion was to supplement the income derived from bread manufacture, which was not sufficient to pay a dividend to shareholders. The tearooms provided one of the first public places where women in the Victorian era could eat a meal, alone or with women friends, without a male escort. While by 1880 unescorted women could visit higher-end restaurants, they had to avoid the bar. In at least one instance, a women's social club was housed directly above an A.B.C. tea shop: > The New Somerville Club, close to Oxford Circus ‚Ä¶ was located over an > Aerated Bread Company's shop, and notwithstanding the complaint that the > female employ√©es [sic] of that company do not participate in the vast > profits of the undertaking, the members of the Somerville get meals from the > aerated bread shop sent up to the general room above, a bright and very > prettily furnished apartment. Men are admitted to this club as guests.\\"Lady > Clubs,\\" The West Australian. Tuesday, 10 May 1892, p 2. (Retrieved > 2009-05-08). The reference to the female employees of the company not sharing in the company's profits was a very real concern at the time. It was even referred to as a \\"gross case of company inhumanity.\\" At the 1895 annual general meeting of the company, Dr. Richardson proposed, and another doctor (also a director), Dr. Furnival, seconded, \\"giving the girls employed by the company some additional advantages.\\" The physicians felt that if the company \\"did not give them one meal a day ‚Ä¶ they were a mean and shabby lot.\\" The board chairman felt that the company had made great strides in that area: they were already giving the employees one meal a day, providing a hot dinner \\"at a nominal price,\\" and \\"[n]ot a girl went into the company's service now who did not receive 10 shillings a week.\\" However, the remunerative conditions of the employees remained an important issue that came to a boil at the 1898 annual general meeting. The dividend that year was 37¬Ω per cent, up from 30 per cent four years previously. The shares initially sold for ¬£1 were trading at ¬£12, but a shareholder who suggested a pay rise for the female shop workers was shouted down and ruled out of order by the chairman. As safe havens for unescorted women of the Victorian era, the A.B.C. tea shops were recommended to delegates of the Congress of the International Council of Women held in London the week ending 9 July 1899.\\"The International Congress,\\" The New York Times. 9 July 1899. p. 18.

This proliferation led George Orwell to view A.B.C.'s tea shops, and those of its competitors, as the \\"sinister strand in English catering, the relentless industrialisation that was overtaking it...everything comes out of a carton or a tin, or is hauled out of a refrigerator or squirted out of a tap or squeezed out of a tube.\\"George Orwell as quoted in: Popham, Peter. \\"The Great Escape\\",The Independent. Friday, 22 September 1995. (Retrieved 2009-05-08.) This did not stop such luminaries as playwright George Bernard Shaw (1856‚Äì1950) from frequenting A.B.C.'s teashops. His diaries are replete with entries attesting to his being a habitu√© of the establishment at various of its London locations. One such entry is for 12 December 1888: \\"‚Ä¶ to the Aerated Bread Shop opposite the Mansion House station and had some eggs and chocolate there.\\"Shaw, George Bernard.

The Shelley Committee's private showing of the play was an attempt by Shaw and his contemporaries to evade this ban. Among other A.B.C. locations at which Shaw dined were Charing Cross Station, Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus, and opposite St. Clement Danes Church. On arriving in England in 1953, the artist Stass Paraskos also gained his first job in London at the Tottenham Court Road branch of the A.B.C. tea shop, working as a pot washer there. End of independence of company The Aerated Bread Company ceased to be an independent company in 1955. Australian operations had already been liquidated in 1951.\\"Aerated Bread Company,\\" deListed.com Date of delisting: 1 April 1951. (Retrieved 2009-09-18.) British operations were changed when the company, self-service tea shops and all, was purchased in 1955 by Allied Bakeries, led by Canadian-born W. Garfield Weston. Weston's corporate empire already owned the luxury Fortnum & Mason food shop and tea rooms in Piccadilly. A U.S. magazine of the day said that \\"[T]he Piccadilly prince is about to marry the tearoom Cinderella.\\" Allied was expected to pay $8.1 million for A.B.C. At that time, Allied itself had a large share of the UK baked goods market. Allied's market share prior to acquiring A.B.C. was 10% of all UK bread production and the sale of 20 million biscuits per day. Allied's sales the year prior were $154 million with profits of $12.6 million in current dollars). With the acquisition, Allied almost doubled its share of the UK's bread market by the end of the decade.Oddy, Derek J. and Derek S. Miller. The Making of the Modern British Diet.

The screenplay by Herschel Weingrod and Timothy Harris was based on the 1902 novel of the same name by George Barr McCutcheon. It is the seventh film based on the story. Plot Monty Brewster is a Minor League Baseball pitcher with the Hackensack Bulls. He and his best friend, Spike Nolan, the Bulls' catcher, are arrested after a post-game bar fight. A man offers to post their bail if they will come to New York City with him. At the Manhattan law office of Granville & Baxter, Brewster is told that his recently deceased great-uncle Rupert Horn, whom he has never met, has left him his entire $300 million fortune, but only if he can complete a challenge with several conditions. Brewster can choose to receive $1 million upfront, or attempt to inherit the whole estate by spending $30 million in 30 days. In the former case, the law firm becomes the executor of the estate, collecting a fee for performing this service and dividing the remainder among several charities. In the latter case, Brewster may not own any assets that are not already his at the end of the 30 days. He must get value for the services of anyone he hires, he may donate 5% to charity and lose 5% by gambling, he cannot give any of the money away, and he may not waste it by purchasing and destroying valuable objects. Finally, he is not allowed to tell anyone, even Spike. If he fails to spend the entire $30 million, he forfeits any remaining balance and inherits nothing. Brewster decides to take the $30 million challenge, and Angela Drake, a paralegal from the law firm, is assigned to accompany him and keep track of his spending. Brewster, who has never earned more than $11,000 a year, rents an expensive hotel suite at the Plaza Hotel, hires personal staff on exorbitant salaries, and places bad gambling bets. However, Spike makes good investments, earning Brewster money. Realizing that he is making no headway, Brewster decides to run for Mayor of New York City and throws most of his money at a protest campaign urging a vote for \\"None of the Above.\\" A copy of the famous Inverted Jenny appears in one of the film's gags The two major candidates threaten to sue Brewster for his confrontational rhetoric, but they settle out of court for several million dollars. Brewster then hires the New York Yankees for a three-inning exhibition against the Bulls, with himself as the pitcher. He is forced to end his protest campaign when he learns that he is leading in the polls as a write-in candidate; the job carries an annual salary of $60,000, which is considered an asset under the terms of the will. Blowing his last $38,000 on a party after the game, Brewster becomes fed up with money and is heartbroken that Spike, Angela, and others around him do not understand his actions. On the final day, he finds that the sycophantic treatment he received from his entourage is gone. Shunned by everyone he knows, Brewster makes his way to the law office. Having withdrawn from the election, he learns that the city voted \\"None of the Above,\\" forcing another election in which none of the previous candidates are running. Warren Cox, a junior lawyer from the law firm and Angela's fianc√©e, has been bribed by the firm to ensure that Brewster fails to spend the entire $30 million. Moments before time expires, Cox hands Brewster some money previously thought to have been spent and informs him he is not broke. Shortly before Brewster signs, Angela learns of the plot and reveals it to him. Brewster punches Cox, who threatens to sue and declines Brewster's offer of the money as compensation. Realizing that he will need a lawyer, Brewster pays the money to Angela as a retainer. With the transaction completed and all of the money now gone, Brewster fulfills the terms of the will and inherits the entire $300 million.

The script was written by the writers of Murphy's Trading Places. \\"I'm always making westerns,\\" Hill said. \\"Whether it's a movie that takes place in the future... or an action- adventure like 48 Hrs., what I'm really doing is making cowboy movies.... I like westerns because everything is very clear in them. 'I like movies in which the story line is simple and straightforward and the characters are confronted with issues of life and death. But Hollywood has decided that people don't like westerns anymore, so I have to make these other movies and pretend they're not westerns... My idea of a good movie is to take very clearly defined characters and put them in the highest possible jeopardy and then see what happens,\\" Hill said. Hill said Richard Pryor ‚Äúdidn't believe that he was funny unless he took drugs, and he believed that if he took drugs he would die.

As of 2012, the station is owned by the Jim Pattison Group and airs an alternative rock radio format branded as 102.7 The Peak. Founded in 1923, the station has broadcast numerous formats on several frequencies, under the call signs CFXC, CJOR, CHRX and CKBD. CKPK's studios are located on West 8th Avenue in the Fairview neighbourhood of Vancouver, while its transmitter is located atop Mount Seymour. History=Early Years In 1923, the station was originally launched by the electrical store Hume and Rumble as experimental station CFXC. It broadcast on 440 metres with a power of 10 watts. It switched to the frequency of 1030 kilocycles in 1925. The following year, the station was acquired by George Chandler. Under Canadian broadcast policy at the time, CFXC was shut down.Historical information on CFXC at Canadian Communications Foundation A new license was issued to Chandler for CJOR. The station subsequently increased power to 50 watts in 1928 and shared time with CNRV, then moved its frequency to 1210 AM and the studios relocated to 840 Howe Street (with another boost in power to 500 watts) in 1930, and then to 600 AM in 1933. CJOR increased its transmission power to 1,000 watts in 1941, moving its transmitter site to Lulu Island. (After the station switched to FM in 2008, CISL moved to the Lulu Island location, making it the oldest broadcasting site in the Vancouver radio market in continuous operation.) CBC Dominion Network In 1944, CJOR became the Vancouver network affiliate of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) Dominion Network. It increased power again in 1947, this time to 5,000 watts, using two 280-foot towers at a site in Richmond. That same year, Chandler established \\"CJOR Ltd.\\" to run the station. In 1961, CJOR further increased power to 10,000 watts, using a three tower array. It became an independent station the following year after CBC ceased the Dominion Network's operations. New Ownership Following George Chandler's death in 1964, the Jim Pattison Group acquired the station the following year. The Board of Broadcast Governors (predecessor of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, or CRTC) had decided not to allow the station parent CJOR Ltd. to renew the license. CJOR Ltd. was then owned by Chandler's widow Marie. The Board of Governors requested that a new buyer for CJOR be found. By the 1970s, the station shifted its focus away from music to talk radio. On October 31, 1983, with the pending demolition of the Grosvenor Hotel on Howe Street, CJOR relocated from the Hotel's basement to its present studios at 1401 West 8th Avenue. On September 2, 1988, at Noon, CJOR dropped its talk radio format, flipping to classic rock, with the new call sign CHRX. The first song was Bob Seger's \\"Old Time Rock & Roll\\". (The former CJOR call sign currently belongs to a radio station in Osoyoos.) The station was very popular during the late 1980s, but started experiencing declining ratings by the early 1990s. Sports and Christian Programming To remedy the ratings loss, in 1993, the station added sports talk shows to its programming. However, this did not boost the ratings. On January 7, 1994, at 6 PM, after signing off with Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", the station began stunting with the sound of ocean waves. On January 9 at Noon, it switched formats and call signs again, becoming CKBD with the on-air brand The Bridge as Canada's first Contemporary Christian music station. The first song on \\"The Bridge\\" was \\"Awesome God\\" by Rich Mullins.http://www.pugetsoundradio.com/2014/06/26/birth-bridge- remembering-format-flip-yesteryear/ On July 31, 1998, the station changed to an adult standards format as 600 AM with the slogan \\"Unforgettable Adult Favourites.\\" Switch to FM On May 30, 2008, CKBD was given approval by the CRTC to move to 100.5 MHz on the FM dial. As part of its move to FM, CKBD planned to switch from adult standards to adult album alternative (AAA) with a new call sign, CKPK-FM. On October 23, 2008, the FM station signed on for testing. The transmitter on 600 AM was shut down on November 13, 2008. The last program was a 25-minute summary of the station's 84-year history on the AM band, followed by \\"Thanks for the Memory\\" by Bob Hope.http://formatchange.com/600-ckbd-signs-off/ The adult standards format moved to Astral Media's CISL (formerly oldies) just days before. At 7:20 that same evening, at a live party at the Seasons in the Park restaurant, \\"100.5 The Peak\\" launched with U2's \\"Elevation.\\"http://formatchange.com/100-5-the- peak-debuts/ CKPK-FM got a new competitor on Canada Day, 2009. CHHR-FM began airing a AAA format, similar to CKPK-FM. CHHR-FM (now CHLG-FM) changed formats to classic hits on June 20, 2014. Move to 102.7 On December 9, 2010, the Jim Pattison Group applied to exchange frequencies with non-commercial community radio station CFRO-FM, which then operated at 102.7 MHz.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2010-928 The application was approved on September 9, 2011.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-580 The swap took place almost a year later on September 10, 2012.The PEAK (is moving to a stronger frequency) TV Commercial Contest During the summer of 2015, CKPK began evolving towards a more modern rock sound. Eventually, CKPK-FM began reporting on the Mediabase Canadian alternative rock panel. By August 2016, CKPK completed its shift to the format, and changed its slogan to \\"Vancouver's Modern Rock,\\" while still retaining the \\"Peak\\" moniker.https://www.facebook.com/rwcrn/photos/a.191085784264112.41586.191081700931187/1156812981024716/?type=3&theater; The station now competes with CFOX-FM, also an alternative rock outlet, owned by Corus Entertainment.

Of these, 3 were adopted in May 2008: * Repeal of the prohibition of any professional occupation for the members of Parliament; * Parliament can amend allocations of the state budget, and to monitor their implementation (article 79); * Special provisions for insular and mountainous regions (article 101). Propositions of the parties Some of the main points of Karamanlis' propositions are: * The modification of the constitutional provision which currently does not allow the foundation and operation of \\"non- state owned\\" universities. * The foundation of a Supreme Constitutional Court, which would replace the Supreme Special Court. * The clarification of the meaning of the constitutional provisions concerning the environment. * The adaption of the constitutional provisions concerning the mass media (Article 14) to the rules of the European law. * The limitation of the cases of immunity of the Greek deputies.Speech of Kostas Karamanlis of 11 May 2006 as exposed by the Greek Channel Alpha: Agreements and Disagreements on the Constitutional Amendment For his part, the leader of leading opposition party, Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), George Papandreou, proposed: * The protection of the human rights of foreigners. * The support of public universities and the operation of \\"non-state owned\\" universities under stringent terms. * The strengthening of direct democracy through the promotion of the institution of the referendum. * The direct election of the President of the Republic, if a parliamentary majority is not achieved. * The introduction of a new legislative procedure initiated by the people. * The rewriting of the preamble, which asserts Greek Orthodoxy's predominant position by the inclusion of the formula \\"in the name of the Holy and Consubstantial and Indivisible Trinity\\".Speech of George Papandreou of the 8 May 2006 Debated issues=Amendment and civil society For their part, constitutional theory experts, such as G. Papadimitriou, pointed out that without the participation of the civil society the proposed amendment could not be viable and effective.G. Papadimitriou, Constitutional amendment and civil society Such a participation was going to strengthen the vigor of the political institutions through: * the boosting of the participatory democracy * the protection of human rights and * the renewal of the political system. Private universities In 2001 New Democracy proposed an amendment of the constitution, in order to allow private universities to operate in Greece on a non-profit basis. This proposal was rejected by then-ruling PASOK, and thus could not muster the support necessary to be put to vote on the constitutional amendment of 2001. However, PASOK has since changed its stance, and now also supports a constitutional provision for the creation of private Universities on a non-profit basis. On behalf of PASOK, Andreas Loverdos underscored his agreement with the operation of private universities, but he insisted that they do not trust the government and that their priority are public universities.A. Loverdos,Interview in radio station FLASH of 3 May 2006 This proposal continues however to encounter the fierce opposition of the Left parties, as well as a sizeable part of the academic community, both professors and students. Former President Christos Sartzetakis agreed with the proposed modification of the constitutional provision, which does not allow the operation of \\"non-state owned\\" universities. He underscored however that the legislative framework must not allow the foundation of private theological schools.Ch. Sartzetakis,Thoughts about the Constitutional Amendment-Part 2 in TO PARON of 6 August 2006 Religion During the 2001 constitutional amendment, complete separation of church and state was proposed, but the two major parties, New Democracy and PASOK, decided not to open this controversial matter. Some still claim, however, that Greece had and continues to have a serious problem of religious freedom. In any case, none of the two main parties has expressed any intention to amend the Article 3 of the Constitution. K. Karamanlis insisted that his party has not modified its position expressed in 2001. Former Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis predicated that the separation of church and state is not necessary. He also argued that the problem with the criminal laws concerning proselytism could be resolved without any amendment of Article 13.K. Mitsotakis, Interview to the TV station NET of 21 May 2006 Ch. Sartzetakis asserted that Article 3 of the Constitution should be amended,Ch. Sartzetakis, Thoughts about the Constitutional Amendment-Part 1 in TO PARON of 30 July 2006 so that all the ecclesiastical provinces of Greece come under the authority of the Church of Greece, in contrast to the current situation, where the lands gained after 1912 lie de jure under the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople per the Patriarchical Volume of 1850 and the Synodical Act of 1928. According to Sartzetakis, this would be the only way to achieve ecclesiastical unity.Ch. Sartzetakis, Ecclesiastical Conflicts and National Problems in ELEFTHEROS TYPOS of 19 October 2003 Election of the President Papandreou proposed the direct election of the President by the people, albeit only in the cases the necessary majority in the Hellenic Parliament could not be achieved, emphasizing that a potential political deadlock could thus be avoided. K. Karamanlis rejected this proposal and asserted that the present constitutional provisions needed no modification, although in 2001 he had also supported the direct election of the President.E. Venizelos, \\"The Amendment of 2001\\", 54 etc. Konstantinos Mitsotakis stayed firm in his traditional position for the direct election of the President by the people. Thereby, he disagreed with ND's current official stance as expressed by its leader. Supporters of Mitsotakis' and Papandreou's proposal, such as Giannis Pretenderis, argue that as the people directly elect their mayor or prefect, they should also in the same way elect the Head of State, whose constitutional role is much more important.G. Pretenderis, Elected or Appointed President?, TO VIMA of 14 May 2006 On the other hand, Christos Sartzetakis argued that the direct election of the President was not allowed by Article 110 of the Constitution. Justice The heads of the supreme courts are appointed by the Cabinet of Greece for a 4-year term. Ch. Sartzetakis disagrees with these procedure and proposed that the heads of the supreme courts should be chosen by lot among the vice-presidents of each supreme court. He also expressed opposition to the 4-year term, as well as with Karamanlis' proposal for the creation of a Constitutional Court. The foundation of this court was dynamically supported by Georgios Souflias. Outcome In the event, Karamanlis' ambitious plans would not be fulfilled, especially after PASOK's withdrawal from the procedure. The Parliament was convened to take its final decisions as regards the constitutional amendment after the elections of 2007. Finally, in May 2008, only 3 of the 38 proposals of New Democracy were passed by the necessary majority of 180 votes, and finally adopted: #the absolute prohibition of any professional occupation for the members of the Hellenic Parliament is lifted (articles 57 and 115). #the Parliament is given the right to amend allocations of the state budget, and to monitor their implementation (article 79); #special legislative care should be taken for the insular and mountainous regions of Greece (article 101).

The TDS motto is \\"Defending Those Who Defend America.\\" A Judge Advocate Colonel heads the Trial Defense Service Office of the Chief, located in Fort Belvoir. TDS consists of the Chief, TDS, the Executive Officer, the Chief of Defense Counsel Assistance Program, several training attorneys, a Senior Legal Administrator Warrant Officer, a Senior Enlisted Paralegal, three administrative staff, and nearly 240 TDS personnel worldwide. Under the Chief of TDS, there are nine Regional Defense Counsel (RDC) responsible for overseeing defense services within a geographic region (see below). Each RDC oversees several Senior Defense Counsel (SDC), who manage field offices with the responsibility of providing defense services for a specific post, command, or area. Some field offices oversee geographically separate branch offices. In the USAR, each LOD has a Colonel as commander, LTC as deputy commander, a warrant officer as legal administrator, and a MSG as chief legal NCO. AR 27-10 attaches all TDS attorneys to the Trial Defense Service with duty at a particular installation and requires the commander of the installation or organization and the respective SJA or supporting legal office to provide administrative and logistical support to defense counsel assigned to the installation, regardless of the lack of a command relationship. The bulk of TDS is made up of US Army Reserve attorneys and paralegals. The reserve component of the Trial Defense Service consists of the 16th Legal Operations Detachment, the 22nd Legal Operations Detachment and the 154th Legal Operations Detachment. The 16th LOD is responsible for reserve TDS services east of the Mississippi and north of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line, and in Germany; the 22nd LOD is responsible for reserve TDS services west of the Mississippi River, Alaska, Hawaii and South Korea; and the 154th LOD is responsible for TDS service east of the Mississippi and south of the Mason Dixon line, and in Puerto Rico. The LODs are divided into distinct regions that are spread throughout their areas of responsibility. Mission The Trial Defense Service provides conflict-free legal services to soldiers who are facing adverse criminal or administrative actions at no cost to the soldier. Unlike public defenders in civilian jurisdictions, there is no means test required to determine eligibility; all soldiers are entitled to TDS representation by virtue of being subject to the UCMJ. The various categories of representation fall into three priorities. * Priority 1: Criminal representation at trials by court-martial is the top priority of TDS and takes precedence over all other actions. Defense Counsel make motions, voir dire the panel, offer evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, present argument, and negotiate on their client's behalf. * Priority 2: Assistance with administrative separations (actions to discharge soldiers prior to the end of their service), non-judicial punishments, and summary courts-martial. * Priority 3: All other actions, including advising soldiers of their rights as a suspect and responding to letters of reprimand. Priority 3 actions may also be handled by legal assistance attorneys, depending on the availability of TDS. History The former insignia of TDS. In the Army military justice system, the main decision maker is the general court-martial convening authority (GCMCA), usually a division, post, or area commander. Each GCMCA has a Staff Judge Advocate, who serves as the legal advisor to the general. The Staff Judge Advocate also supervises a number of subordinate attorneys assigned to his or her particular unit. Collectively, the attorneys assigned to a particular command are called the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate. Prior to the late 1970s, the duty of defense counsel was just another assignment within the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, much like the trial counsel (military prosecutor). To some, this created the appearance of a conflict of interest when two opposing counsel worked within the same office. To others, especially some soldier clients, the fact that their defense counsel wore the same unit patch as the prosecuting attorney and worked in the same building created the impression that their attorney was on the general's side and not theirs. Between 1978 and 1980, the Army Chief of Staff approved an experimental program to determine whether it would be feasible to create a separate command solely for Army defense counsel. The pilot program was deemed a success, and in December 1980, the Trial Defense Service was born. Because of the limited number of TDS attorneys (even the Army's largest installation, has only about 10 TDS attorneys), the TDS organization was originally not large enough to have its own unit patch (shoulder sleeve insignia). For 25 years, the TDS \\"unit patch\\" was World War II-vintage patch of the Army Service Forces. This patch had come to be designated the Department of the Army Staff Support patch and is worn by Department of the Army field operating agencies,DA Staff Support including the US Army Safety Center and the Defense Commissary Agency. In August 2006, however, a distinctive unit patch for TDS was approved for wear. From the Institute of Heraldry's description: \\"The shield-shaped patch reflects the nature of legal defense work. The sword supporting scales of justice represents the unit's mission to defend soldiers at courts-martial and separations boards; seeking justice for all soldiers. The sword also signifies that Trial Defense Service personnel are soldiers as well as lawyers. The glory, mullet, and the red border are adapted from the Department of the Army Staff Support patch previously authorized for wear by the Trial Defense Service, and provides a historical link to its organizational heritage.\\" The former Southern Iraq TDS branch office on COB Adder in Tallil.

Elisha Phelps along with his brother Noah Phelps and others took part in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775. Capt. Phelps was appointed as commissary of the Northern Department by the Continental Congress.The Phelps Tavern Museum The house was used as a hotel named the Canal Hotel, after the War of 1812. It is located along what was the New Haven and Northampton Canal line. Family life Elisha Phelps was born at Simsbury, Connecticut, on October 17, 1737. His father David (May 7, 1710-December 9, 1760) married Abigail Pettibone (April 25, 1731-October 16, 1787) on April 25, 1731. Both families descended from original settlers of Dorchester, Massachusetts (and five years later, Windsor, Massachusetts) who as Puritans arrived in the New World aboard the ship Mary and John in 1630. He died at age 43 in Albany, New York, on July 14, 1776, from diseases he contracted from the soldiers he cared for there. After his death, the homestead passed from his widow and surviving children to his brother Noah Phelps and until 1962 was the property of his descendants, including Jeffrey O. Phelps. Phelps Tavern Museum The estate is now known as The Phelps Tavern Museum. The museum uses period rooms and interactive exhibits and galleries to interpret the use of the house as an inn from 1786 to 1849. Three successive generations of the Phelps tavern-keepers are chronicled along with the social history of taverns in New England. From Masonic meetings to ordination balls, the Phelps Tavern hosted townspeople and travelers who arrived by horse, stagecoach and canal.

The standard grip taught in many dealer schools around the world, it is also widely used by magicians and card cheaters as it provides a sturdy and versatile means by which to hold the cards. Covering the deck with the hand allows the holder to manipulate the cards so as to view the top card's face (useful in poker or blackjack) or to lift and select a card without the spectator's knowledge (useful in card tricks). Instructions To form the Mechanic's Grip, first hold the deck in the hand, in the same way as holding a hammer or tool. The cards should be lying flat in the palm with the longer side of the deck lying along the fingers. Take the pointer finger and move it to the short side facing away from the person holding the deck. Take the middle finger, ring finger, and pinkie finger and place them on the long side of the deck. Finally the thumb holds the deck together on the long side opposite of the other fingers. With this grip, more of the deck should be covered by the hand, thus making it more difficult for spectators to see what the magician is doing.

Air is confined between the two spirals and is compressed as it is forced towards the centre. In automotive application, the spirals would have far fewer turns. The scroll- type supercharger is a scroll compressor used as a positive displacement orbiting-spiral supercharger. It is a compromise between the more rugged rotating lobe, and the more efficient sliding vane type superchargers, and is considered to offer the highest potential in regard to efficiency, noise and pressure fluctuation. History The basic concept of the scroll-type supercharger was invented by L√©on Creux of France in 1905, originally for aircraft use, though Creux did consider it as a possible form of steam engine. However, Creux's supercharger failed due to the relatively poor casting techniques available at the time. This type of supercharger has not seen widespread use in the aviation role, but has been used on a small number of automotive applications. Description The moving parts of the supercharger is a disc-shaped displacer with identical spirals (or scrolls) projecting from each side, and manufactured from light alloy to reduce inertia. A pair of fixed scrolls supported by the end walls of the compressor chamber are interleaved with the moving scrolls. Rather than rotating, the displacer is driven in an orbital motion to create a pumping action between the pairs of scrolls. Air is pulled into the device when the moving scrolls are at their furthest from the fixed scrolls, leaving a large gap. As the shaft rotates the gap closes, and the point of widest opening rotates to a point further \\"into\\" the charger. As the process continues the gap eventually ends up on the middle of the housing, at the point where the higher pressure air exhausts into the engine. The scrolls are shaped so the gap slowly decreases in size as it moves to the centre, thereby compressing the air. The edges of the scrolls are sealed by strip-type seals, while the supercharger's main shaft bearings use radial seals to prevent the charge air from becoming contaminated with oil. Volkswagen G-Lader The most common and well known scroll-type supercharger is the G-Lader (Lader is German for charger), designed by Volkswagen for use in a version of the Mk2 Polo called the GT G40. Launched first as a limited batch of about 500 cars in 1987, most were sold to Volkswagen workers. A normal production version of the G40 was launched as part of the Mk2F range. The name comes from the \\"G\\" shape of its compression channels. It was mounted on a petrol engine, which offered performance about that of a naturally aspirated engine. A similar, but larger G60 became available in the Volkswagen Corrado during the early 1990s, and was also available in limited numbers in the Volkswagen Passat and Volkswagen Golf. The G60 won International Engine of the Year when it was introduced in 1989. The \\"40\\" and \\"60\\" denote the displacer scroll width in millimetres. All supercharger types benefit from the use of an intercooler to get rid of the heat produced during compression, and therefore help increase the density of the charged air.

Club career Harry Gough was born in Chesterfield and played for non-league sides Spital Olympic and Castleford Town before joining Bradford Park Avenue in 1910 for a fee of ¬£30. He played three games for Bradford before returning to Castleford Town. In 1913 he moved to Sheffield United where over the next ten years he would make 242 league appearances and win an FA Cup winners' medal in 1915. This was the last major competition before football was suspended during World War I. At the end of the war, he returned to the Bramall Lane club. A decision to become a publican in Castleford broke the conditions of his contract and he was suspended for six months in the summer of 1924. His final game for United was a 2‚Äì0 County Cup Final victory over the Wednesday. On the completion of his suspension in December 1924, he returned to Castleford Town, before moving to Harrogate the following year from where he joined Oldham Athletic in 1926. He played four times for Oldham, moving to Bolton Wanderers in 1927, playing four league games before joining Torquay United in the summer of 1928. He immediately dislodged Archie Bayes as Torquay's first choice goalkeeper, missing just three games in his first season.

In 2018 Pegasus Books published The Antiquities Hunter: A Gina Miyoko Mystery, the first in a series of private detective novels. Feminist and religious themes The Meri series revolves around the period of transition among the people who live on a peninsula. The chapters are headed with quotes from scripture presented as those of the religion of the people but many are in fact quotes from Bah√° º√≠ scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, the Dhammapada and other Buddhist sacred texts, the Qur ºan and the Bible. The first and second book also carry an acknowledgement of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, a Local Spiritual Assembly and Bah√° º√≠ community._The Meri_ and _Taminy_ by Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff a book review by Mary K. Kuhner The plot involves a progression on the understanding of a people in relation to the role and position of women. Unknown to the people of the story, women have always been instrumental to their religion as agents of God and a chosen few have always acted as the personification of the Spirit of God, or \\"Meri\\". The first book focuses on a young girl destined to take on that role. While similar to other stories of the triumph of women it has several unique qualities most particularly a central male character being her benefactor and teacher and not an obstacle she has to overcome. The second book focuses on the return of the prior \\"Meri\\" who takes it as her mission as the head of the renewed religion to promulgate the new paradigm of the role of women. The third book focuses on her transition to being a head of state but wrestling with several of the same issues from among as well as beyond her people. Another novel she has written called The Spirit Gate has many of the same features but is written in a different context ‚Äî a fantasy work set in a historical time and place of roughly AD 1000 in the area today of Poland and Ukraine where two forms of Christianity (Eastern Orthodox and Catholic) and Islam met the pagan older religion. Bah√° º√≠ themes, especially in the respect granted other religions, are largely identified with the older religion. Several of these themes are also in Bohnhoff's shorter writings ‚Äî \\"Infinite Sky, Infinite God\\" highlights a Catholic future. Several short stories center on women ‚Äî like \\"The Doctor's Wife\\" and \\"The White Dog\\" and both have reference to a religion.

Music Though Bohnhoff's interest in music as a career stretches back to her high school years and her mother, her avocation as a musician was started by 1980 when she was a member of a band called \\"Talisman\\" playing a mix of original progressive rock and top 40 and got some airtime on KZAP, a radio station in Sacramento, California. The Bonhoffs later reformed as part the band \\"Syntax\\" through which they released a cassette tape \\"Silent Planet\\" in 1990 ‚Äî \\"Syntax\\" using a substantial amount of MIDI based music. They were introduced to filk music in 1991 and predominantly use acoustic guitars in their live shows. In 1991 the Bohnhoffs had been invited to a science fiction convention for Maya's \\"Hand-me Down Town\\" publication in Analog magazine because Maya was up for the Nebula Award. At a party for the event Jeff had the opportunity to a jam session with founding filk musicians Dr. Jane Robinson, Cynthia McQuillin and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough. After other conventions mostly for Maya's writing, Jeff and Maya were spontaneously invited to play music at the 1995 Baycon by Kathy Mar. It was after a long evening of music that they wrote \\"Knights in White Satin\\". Filk and parody have become their main musical presence, though now they perform through their own production company, MysticFig and as a duo predominantly. Mrs. and Mr. Bohnhoff have given concerts at various science fiction conventions and conference for many years and have won awards doing so. They have attended conventions Norwescon, Worldcon, LepreCon, Consonance, OryCon, the Ohio Valley Filk Fest and others. They have produced a quartet of CDs through their own production company. They also play often at the local Bah√° º√≠ events and Centers. Maya also participated in a panel discussion \\"Intro to Filk - Who are those people sing weird songs?\\" at the 1997 OryCon and \\"Steal That Tune - Filkers have borrowed tunes from folk sources, rock singers, Broadway shows, you name it. And not all of the results are parodies....\\" with her husband and others.

Overthrows usually occur when a fielder aims unsuccessfully at the stumps in an attempt to run out a batsman, although sometimes they are due to handling errors by the fielder receiving the ball. Runs scored in this manner are counted in addition to any runs already scored before the fielding error took place, and are credited to the batsman. If the ball reaches the boundary as a result of an overthrow then the four runs for the boundary are added to the number of completed runs before the overthrow,The Laws of Cricket - Law 19.6 which can lead to the unusual event of a batsman scoring more than six runs off a single ball. It is considered an overthrow run if a ball hits a wicket while the batsman is inside the popping crease and then the batsman runs. There have been at least four instances in Test cricket of eight runs being scored off a single ball.Cricinfo - Ask Steven The most recent was by Andrew Symonds for Australia against New Zealand at Brisbane in November 2008, when the batsmen managed to run four runs before the ball was thrown back over the wicket keeper's head for a four-run boundary. It is possible for the ball to be thrown over more than once from the same ball, leading to even more runs being scored. In theory there is therefore no limit to how many runs may be scored off a single ball. It is considered an overthrow run if a ball hits a wicket while the batsman is inside the popping crease and then the batsman runs.  Deflections  A throw that reflects off the batsman or bat and goes to the boundary is sometimes also considered an overthrow. A notable incidence of this was in the 2019 Cricket World Cup Final, where six runs were scored off a deflection from Ben Stokes's bat.

It is based on the novel Les Particules √©l√©mentaires by Michel Houellebecq. The film stars Moritz Bleibtreu as Bruno, Christian Ulmen as Michael, Martina Gedeck as Christiane, Franka Potente as Annabelle, and Nina Hoss as Jane. The film had its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival in Germany in February 2006. In contrast to the book setting in Paris, the film was shot entirely and is mainly situated in various places in Germany. Cities and states in Germany used for filming included Thuringia and Berlin. Contrary to the book, the film does not have cultural pessimism as a main theme, and it has an alternative ending. Plot The film focuses on Michael (Michael Djerzinski) and Bruno and their disturbed sexuality. They are half-brothers who are very different from each other. They both had an unusual childhood because their mother was a hippie, instead growing up with their grandmothers and in boarding schools. Michael grows up to become a molecular biologist and in doing so becomes more fascinated with genetics and separating reproduction and sexuality by cloning rather than having actual sexual relationships. He is frustrated by his current job in Berlin and decides to continue his research on cloning at an institution in Ireland. Bruno, a secondary school teacher and unsuccessful author, on the other hand, is obsessed with his own sexual desires and systematically drowns himself in failed attempts with women and nights with prostitutes. He voluntarily checks himself into a mental institution after having sexually harassed one of his students. Before his departure to Ireland, Michael visits the village of his childhood for the first time in years. To his surprise, he meets his childhood friend Annabelle there and finds that she is still single and they start a sexual relationship. Bruno leaves the mental institution and goes on holiday to a hippie camp after being faced with divorce by his wife. At the camp he meets Christiane, who is also sexually open. Although they have an open relationship, he falls in love with her. During a sex orgy at one of their visits to a swing club, Christiane collapses and Bruno is faced in hospital with the news that Christiane is paralysed forever because of a chronic illness. Nonetheless Bruno wants to live with her until the end. However Christiane insists that he should take some time for consideration. Michael moves to Ireland and learns that, despite his doubts, his old research on cloning was a revolutionary breakthrough. However he misses Annabelle but does not manage to get her on the phone. Annabelle is informed that she is pregnant but must have an abortion and her womb removed due to life-threatening abnormalities. Bruno calls Christiane but always replaces the receiver after just one ring. He finally drives to her apartment only to learn that she has committed suicide shortly before. Subsequently he re-enters mental institution totally devastated. Michael is told by Annabelle's mother that Annabelle had an abortion and a severe surgery. He immediately leaves Ireland for Annabelle and finally openly admits his deep love to her. In hospital Bruno has hallucinations of Christiane who explains to him that her suicide was not his fault. In his imagination he tells her that he ultimately has decided to stay with her forever. After Annabelle recovers and before their departure to Ireland, Michael and Annabelle visit Bruno in hospital and take him to the beach. Michael asks Bruno if he wants to come with Annabelle and him to Ireland but Bruno decides to live happily in hospital with Christiane in his mind forever. The film ends with title cards stating that Michael Djerzinski received the Nobel Prize. This too is fiction.

The red region highlights a Ubiquitin-Independent degron A degron is a portion of a protein that is important in regulation of protein degradation rates. Known degrons include short amino acid sequences, structural motifs and exposed amino acids (often LysineDohmen, R.J., P. Wu, and A. Varshavsky, Heat-inducible degron: a method for constructing temperature-sensitive mutants. Science, 1994. 263(5151): p. 1273-1276. or Arginine) located anywhere in the protein. In fact, some proteins can even contain multiple degrons. Degrons are present in a variety of organisms, from the N-degrons (see N-end Rule) first characterized in yeast to the PEST sequence of mouse ornithine decarboxylase. Degrons have been identified in prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes. While there are many types of different degrons, and a high degree of variability even within these groups, degrons are all similar for their involvement in regulating the rate of a protein's degradation. Much like protein degradation (see proteolysis) mechanisms are categorized by their dependence or lack thereof on Ubiquitin, a small protein involved in proteasomal protein degradation, Degrons may also be referred to as ‚ÄúUbiquitin-dependent\\" or ‚ÄúUbiquitin-independent\\". Types Ubiquitin- dependent degrons are so named because they are implicated in the polyubiquitination process for targeting a protein to the proteasome. In some cases, the degron itself serves as the site for polyubiquitination as is seen in TAZ and Œ≤-catenin proteins. Because the exact mechanism by which a degron is involved in a protein's polyubiqutination is not always known, degrons are classified as Ubiquitin-dependent if their removal from the protein leads to less ubiquitination or if their addition to another protein leads to more ubiquitination. In contrast, Ubiquitin-independent degrons are not necessary for the polyubiquitination of their protein. For example, the degron on IkBa, a protein involved in the regulation of the immune system, was not shown to be involved in ubiquitination since its addition to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) did not increase ubiquitination. However, a degron can only hint at the mechanism by which a protein is degraded and so identifying and classifying a degron is only the first step in understanding the degradation process for its protein. Identification Shown is a diagram representing two degron- identifying procedures outlined in the text. In the first (green) procedure, the unaltered form of the protein remains abundant over time while the mutant form containing a degron candidate decreases rapidly. In the second (red) procedure the unaltered form of a protein containing the degron candidate decreases rapidly over time while the mutant form stripped of its degron remains abundant. A' versus A are used to notate protein forms containing the degron vs not containing the degron. In order to identify a portion of a protein as a degron, there are often three steps performed. First, the degron candidate is fused to a stable protein, such as GFP, and protein abundances over time are compared between the unaltered protein and the fusion (as shown in green). If the candidate is in fact a degron, then the abundance of the fusion protein will decrease much faster than that of the unaltered protein. Second, a mutant form of the degron's protein is designed such that it lacks the degron candidate. Similar to before, the abundance of the mutant protein over time is compared to that of the unaltered protein (as shown in red). If the deleted degron candidate is in fact a degron, then the mutant protein abundance will decrease much slower than that of the unaltered protein. Recall that degrons are often referred to as ‚ÄúUbiquitin-dependent‚Äù or ‚ÄúUbiquitin- independent‚Äù The third step performed is often done after one or both of the previous two steps, because it serves to identify the Ubiquitin dependence or lack thereof of a previously identified degron. In this step, protein A and A‚Äô (identical in every way except the presence of degron in A‚Äô) will be examined. Note that mutation or fusion procedures could be performed here, so either A is a protein like GFP and A‚Äô is a fusion of GFP with the degron (as shown in green) or A‚Äô is the degron's protein and A is a mutant form without the degron (as shown in Red.) The amount of Ubiquitin bound to A and to A‚Äô will be measured. A significant increase in the amount of Ubiquitin in A‚Äô as compared to A will suggest that the degron is Ubiquitin-dependent.

They were known for their surreal performances.  Career  The Temperance Seven was founded at Christmas 1955 by students at the Chelsea School of Art, though the band mythologized its foundation as dating from 1904 at the fictitious Pasadena Cocoa Rooms, Balls Pond Road, North London. The three founder members were Paul McDowell (who originally played trombone), Philip Harrison (who originally played banjo) and Brian Innes (drums). Gradually the band evolved into a nine-piece ensemble with a light-hearted and humorous performing style, although they were all serious musicians. The name \\"Temperance Seven\\" was suggested by Douggie Gray, of the Alberts fame. The Alberts were cult figures in the art scene in the mid 1950s and were forerunners of the sort of humour that became Monty Python. (This was not the band's only link with Monty Python; see below). The Temperance Seven was a subtle play on words - the number seven being \\"one under the eight\\". That there were nine members or \\"one over the eight\\" implied intemperance. In 1960, they recorded \\"Ukulele Lady\\" with vocal refrain by Peter Sellers, produced by George Martin. It was featured on Parlophone PMC 1131, a 12-inch album called Peter and Sophia (Loren). In 1961, the Temperance Seven achieved national fame with the #1 hit \\"You're Driving Me Crazy\\", arranged by Frank Skinner and produced by George Martin. It was quickly followed by \\"Pasadena\\", which reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart. They toured the UK widely that year, often in shows promoted by their manager Ralph Peters and their performances acquired a set routine beginning with the last few bars of \\"Pasadena\\" (which became their signature tune) and ending with the stirring strains of the \\"Gaumont-British News\\". By the summer of 1961 their fame was such that they appeared at the London Palladium for a two-week top of the bill performance. This was arranged by Ralph in combination with an appearance at that year's Royal Variety Performance. Before the band became known nationally, Paul McDowell had also been a member of the Experimental Theatre Club revue, with Ian Davidson, Robin Grove-White and Doug Fisher. At the time, they had been performing their show, called \\"****\\" (Four Asterisks), at the Edinburgh Fringe, but after the runaway success of \\"You're Driving Me Crazy\\", McDowell had to quit the group to tour with his band. This prompted Davidson to look for a replacement, and he found Terry Jones, future Monty Python member, who thus obtained his first chance to be part of the revue. The Temperance Seven came to popularity during the resurgent trad-jazz era of the early 1960s. Their unique sound, coupled with their musicianship and ingeniously humorous compositions, set them apart from their contemporaries; however, they arrived at the cusp of that era and as popular tastes changed with the emergence of the Beatles, the Temperance Seven gradually slipped into obscurity, although the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band attempted to wear their mantle for several years whilst claiming no affiliation. The Temperance Seven is also listed as the band for Spike Milligan and John Antrobus' stage play The Bed-Sitting Room,Milligan, Spike, & Antrobus, John (1973) The Bedsitting Room. Tandem: London. First published in Great Britain by Margaret & Jack Hobbs, 1970. Published by Universal-Tandem, 1972. ¬© 1970 Spike Milligan and John Antrobus which opened at the Mermaid Theatre on 31 January 1963, with a subsequent production opening on 3 May 1967 at the Saville Theatre. The original Temperance Seven were dissolved in the mid 1960s, but the band was resurrected in the latter part of that decade by drummer Dave Mills, who had replaced Brian Innes in 1966 and led the band for several years, firstly as The New Temperance Seven, and was instrumental in arranging their appearances in Hong Kong and Bahrain, where he eventually settled to be replaced by Ian Howarth. The band continued to perform with new personnel and, from time to time, original members made guest appearances. During the 1980s, Chris Hook took over leadership of the band. The personnel have not changed since that time and the band continues to work around the UK. Many members of the original band reunited for a BBC Radio programme about the group in 2003. Members The Temperance Seven dressed in a manner appropriate to the style of music they played.

In addition to covering the major American sports leagues and international events such as the Olympics and the World Cup, Kaufman's columns often deal with issues related to the state of American sports. Some specific concerns of Kaufman include the role of race in sports and American culture, publicly financed stadiums, performance-enhancing substances, the inequalities and hypocrisy in the NCAA, and the poor quality of television sports announcing. His articles feature light-hearted humor, typically with a degree of self-deprecation. A former Angeleno, he enjoys relating stories of his fond memories of the Dodger games he listened to as a child. Annually, he tracks the performance of NFL prognosticators, himself included, along with his son Buster, the \\"coin- flippinest 4-year-old in North America\\", who flips coins to randomly predict the outcome of (presumably) closely contested games. Kaufman has proposed changing the rules of nearly every organized sport, including removal of field goals from American football, the elimination of free throws from basketball, and the abolishment of offsides from soccer. Kaufman is a frequent critic of sports announcers who use shoddy statistics or generally do not care about the sport which they are announcing. He has particular distaste for coverage of Major League Baseball on the Fox Network, including the playoffs, World Series and All-Star Game. Kaufman, an admirer of sabermetrician Bill James, made his own contribution to baseball statistics by creating the Neifi Index . Named for infielder Neifi P√©rez, this statistic measures a player's ability to contribute to his team's success by not playing. Introduced as an award that \\"we, the great whiffing, grounder-booting, sedentary lifestyle-leading masses, wouldn't just have a chance of winning if we were allowed to play. We'd be a lock\\", the Neifi Index is the difference between a player's team's winning percentage when he does not play and when he does play. It is called the Neifi Index because when Kaufman first computed it, the San Francisco Giants winning percentage when P√©rez did not play was .929, but was only .542 when he did play, thus giving Neifi an index of .387.

He lived much of the latter half of his life in Buxton, Maine, USA, recording the faces of much of Maine's elite society of his time. According to the website of the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, New York, \\"Brewster was not an artist who incidentally was Deaf but rather a Deaf artist, one in a long tradition that owes many of its features and achievements to the fact that Deaf people are, as scholars have noted, visual people.\\" Website of the Fenimore Art Museum, Cooperstown, New York, exhibition info page: \\"A Deaf Artist in Early America: The Worlds of John Brewster, Jr.,\\" accessed February 28, 2007. Family and early life Brewster's father, Dr. John Brewster Sr., and his stepmother, Ruth Avery Brewster, c. 1795‚Äì1800 Little is known about Brewster's childhood or youth. He was the third child born in Hampton, Connecticut, to Dr. John and Mary (Durkee) Brewster. His mother died when he was 17. His father remarried Ruth Avery of Brooklyn, Connecticut, and they went on to have four more children.

They are shown at home in conventional poses and wearing refined but not opulent dress in a modestly furnished room. His mother sits behind her husband, reading while he is writing. \\"She stares directly at the viewer, though softly, even submissively, while her husband stares off into the distance as if locked in some deep thought.\\" As a Deaf from birth, and growing up in a time when no standardized sign language for the Deaf existed, the young Brewster probably interacted with few people outside of the circle of his family and friends, with whom he would have learned to communicate. A kindly minister taught him to paint, and by the 1790s he was traveling through Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and eastern New York State, taking advantage of his family connections to offer his services to the wealthy merchant class. His younger brother, Dr. Royal Brewster, moved to Buxton, Maine in late 1795. The artist either moved up with him or followed shortly afterward and painted likenesses in and around Portland in between trips back to Connecticut. Work as a Deaf artist James Prince and Son, William Henry (1801) by John Brewster, Jr. Prince was a wealthy merchant from Newburyport, a shipping center in Massachusetts. The painter included numerous expensive luxuries to show Prince as wealthy and a gentleman: Curtains and a fine floor indicated wealth; the bookcase with books and the desk suggest learning. The boy is symbolized as entering world of adults by his holding a letter. (from the collection of the Historical Society of Old Newbury) Brewster probably communicated with others using pantomime and a small amount of writing. In this way, Brewster managed the business of arranging poses along with negotiating prices and artistic ideas with his sitters. As an itinerant portraitist working in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the United States, he would travel great distances, often staying in unfamiliar places for months at a time. His Deafness may have given Brewster some advantages in portrait painting, according to the Florence Griswold Museum exhibit web page: \\"Unable to hear and speak, Brewster focused his energy and ability to capture minute differences in facial expression. He also greatly emphasized the gaze of his sitters, as eye contact was such a critical part of communication among the Deaf. Scientific studies have proven that since Deaf people rely on visual cues for communication [they] can differentiate subtle differences in facial expressions much better than hearing people.\\" Influences Brewster's early, large portraits show the influence of the work of Ralph Earl (1751‚Äì1801), another itinerant painter. Paintings by the two artists (especially in Brewster's early work) show similar scale, costumes, composition and settings, Paul D'Ambrosio has pointed out in a catalog (2005) for a traveling exhibition of Brewster's work,\\"A Deaf Artist in Early America: The Worlds of John Brewster Jr.\\" Earl was influenced by the 18th century English \\"Grand Manner\\" style of painting, with its dramatic, grand, very rhetorical style (exemplified in many portraits by Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Joshua Reynolds. Earl and Brewster refashioned the style, changing it from lofty and grand to more humble and casual settings. Career Mother with Son (Lucy Knapp Mygatt and Son, George, of Danbury, Connecticut), 1799 In the early 19th century, Brewster habitually painted half-length portraits which saved him labor, saved his patrons money and \\"were better suited to his limited abilities,\\" according to Genocchio. Some of the paintings are almost identical, down to the same clothes and furniture, with only the heads setting them apart. In 1805 his brother, Dr. Royal Brewster, finished construction of his Federal style house in Buxton, and John Brewster moved in. For the rest of his life, he lived in the home with his brother's family. By about 1805, Brewster had his own style of portraying children in full length, with skimpy garments or nightclothes, soft, downy hair and big, cute eyes for a sweet, appealing affect. But the perspective problems remained, with the figures seeming out of scale with their environment. At about this time the artist also began to sign and date his paintings more frequently. He also moved away from the large-format Grand Manner-influenced style and turned to smaller, more intimate portraits in which he focused more attention on the faces of his subjects. In the years just before 1817, Brewster traveled farther for clients as his career flourished. Francis O. Watts with Bird Francis O. Watts with Bird (1805) by John Brewster, Jr. (from the collection of the Fenimore Art Museum, Cooperstown, New York) Typical of Brewster's portraits is \\"Francis O. Watts with Bird\\" (1805), showing \\"an innocent looking boy with manly features\\" wearing a nightslip and holding a bird on his finger and with a string. The surrounding landscape is \\"strangely low and wildly out of scale‚Äîthe young boy towers over trees and dwarfs distant mountains. He looks like a giant,\\" Genocchio has written. Or he looks as if the viewer must be lying down, looking up at the child from the ground. Brewster always struggled with the relationship of his figures to the background. A more positive view of the portrait comes from the Web page about the 2006 exhibit at the Florence Griswold Museum website: \\"Brewster‚Äôs serene and ethereal portrait of Francis O. Watts is one of his most compelling portraits of a child. In this work‚Äîparticularly Francis‚Äô white dress and the peaceful landscape he inhabits‚Äîmodern viewers often feel a palpable sense of the silence that was Brewster's world. \\"The bird on the string symbolizes mortality because only after the child‚Äôs death could the bird go free, just like the child‚Äôs soul. Infant mortality was high during Brewster‚Äôs time and artists employed this image often in association with children.\\" In school Moses Quinby (c. 1810‚Äì1815). Quinby was a successful lawyer from Stroudwater, Maine. He was probably painted when Brewster was traveling in Maine. From 1817 to 1820, Brewster interrupted his career to learn sign language at the newly opened Connecticut Asylum in Hartford, now known as the American School for the Deaf. Brewster, at age 51, was by far the oldest in a class of seven students, the average age of which was 19. It was the first class that attended the school and witnessed the birth of American Sign Language (ASL). Later life When Brewster returned to Buxton and to his portraits, \\"he seems to have taken more care when painting the faces of his subjects,\\" Genocchio wrote,\\" resulting in portraits that show an increased sensitivity to the characters of his subjects.\\" After the 1830s, little is known of Brewster's work‚Äîor of Brewster. He died in Buxton on August 13, 1854. Assessments of Brewster's artistry Reverend Daniel Marrett (1831). An example of a Brewster portraits from his late career, many of which show great depth and strength of characterization. Marrett's furrowed brow and chisled features convey the seriousness of his convictions. The paper he holds quotes Amos 4:12, \\"Prepare to meet thy God.\\" (from the collection of Historic New England/SPNEA) Brewster \\"created hauntingly beautiful images of American life during the formative period of the nation,\\" according to a page at the Fenimore Art Museum website devoted to a 2005‚Äì2006 exhibition of the artist's work. \\"Working in a style that emphasized simpler settings [than the \\"Grand Manner\\" style], along with broad, flat areas of color, and soft, expressive facial features, Brewster achieved a directness and intensity of vision rarely equaled.\\" The Fenimore website also says, \\"His extant portraits show his ability to produce delicate and sensitive likenesses in full-size or miniature, and in oil on canvas or ivory. He was especially successful in capturing childhood innocence in his signature full- length likenesses of young children. The website says Brewster left \\"an invaluable record of his era and a priceless artistic legacy.\\" According to the anonymous writer of the Florence Griswold Museum's web page about the same exhibit, \\"Brewster‚Äôs Deafness may also have shaped his mature portrait style, which centers on his emphasis on the face of his sitters, particularly the gaze. He managed to achieve a penetrating grasp of personality in likenesses that engage the viewer directly. Brewster combined a muted palette that highlights flesh tones with excellent draftsmanship to draw attention to the eyes of his sitters. The importance of direct eye contact to a Deaf person cannot be overstated.\\" The same writer also says, \\"Brewster was one of the greatest folk painters in American history as one of the key figures in the Connecticut style of American Folk Portraiture. In addition, Brewster‚Äôs paintings serve as a key part of Maine history. Brewster was the most prolific painter of the Maine elite, documenting through the portraits details of the life of Maine‚Äôs federal elite.\\" Genocchio, reviewing the exhibit for the New York Times, took a dimmer view, noting Brewster's difficulty with painting backgrounds but admiring his \\"sweetly appealing\\" paintings of children.

From right to left: Joseph Seidener, Moses T. Schnirer, Theodor Herzl, David Wolffsohn, Max Bodenheimer David Wolffsohn (; ; 9 October 1856 in Darbƒónai, Kovno Governorate - 15 September 1914) was a Lithuanian-Jewish businessman, prominent early Zionist and second president of the Zionist Organization (ZO). Biography David Wolffsohn was born in Darbƒónai, Lithuania (then Russian Empire) to religious parents, Isaac and Feiga. He received an observant religious education from his parents and in 1872 was sent to Germany to avoid conscription into the Russian army. He moved to Memel, East Prussia, to live his family, where he met Rabbi Isaac R√ºlf. R√ºlf accepted him as a student and taught Wolffsohn the German language, mathematics, and introduced him to the Hovevei Zion movement. Then he moved to Lyck (today E≈Çk) were he met A. D. Gordon. He died in Homburg, Germany. Zionist activism At the start of the 20th century, Wolffsohn accompanied Theodor Herzl in his travels to Palestine and Istanbul. Wolffsohn was elected as the vice president of the Zionist Organization in the World Zionist Congress of 1905, and in 1907 became its president. Before he died, he provided a short synopsis of his life for Nahum Sokolow, another Zionist leader of the time. In it he notes the following:Nahum Sokolow, History of Zionism: 1600-1918, Appendix LXXXIII, p.388-89 (1919) :\\"My biography offers nothing of special interest to the general public. It may be divided into two parts : Zionist and personal. The Zionist portion is closely bound up with the history of our movement during the last ten years, and the facts concerning my modest work can hardly be distinguished from the general history of the movement. The personal portion of my career, on the other hand, contains nothing that transcends the ordinary. It is the simple story of a man of the Jewish people, of the Jewish Ghetto.\\" In addition to his early specifics noted above, he wrote: :\\"My parents were poor, pious Jews. My late father, Isaac, was a talmudic scholar, and devoted his whole life to study and teaching. He earned a precarious livelihood from his lessons. My late mother, the type of a pious, good, clever Jewess, had to bear the burden of the household and the education of her children. Life in my parents' house was thoroughly Jewish. Zionism at that time was, of course, not known under that name, but, so far as the ideal of Zionism is concerned, I can say that in our home our lives were thoroughly inspired by the Zionist ideal. Till my fourteenth year I studied, according to the old Jewish custom, in the Cheder and Beth Hamedrash of my native town.\\" For later years, he wrote :\\"In the early seventies I went to Memel, where my oldest brother was then residing. Here I made the acquaintance of Rabbi Dr. I. J. Rulf, who had great influence on my future career and way of thinking. Shortly afterwards I went to West Prussia, where I served several years as apprentice in a pious Jewish business-house. I also spent six months in Lyck, where I frequently met in his own house David Gordon, the editor of Ha'magid, who was one of the earliest Zionist pioneers. In 1877 I returned to Memel, where I set up in business for myself, and married. After some time I removed to East Friesland, and in 1887 to my present home in Cologne.\\" Of his Zionist activities, he said: :\\"I can hardly give any data concerning my Zionist work. Zionism for me is hardly a thing that can be put into chronological, historical order. Zionism has been, rather, my life. Ever since I learned to think and feel I was a Zionist. I took a lively interest in the Choveve Zion movement and was in active correspondence with all the leaders of this movement in Germany. In 1894 I delivered in Cologne my first address on Zionism and helped to found the local society for the promotion and support of Jewish agriculture in Syria and Palestine, which was established in the same year. The appearance of Herzl's Judenstaat (in 1896) was epoch-making for me. This pamphlet made such a deep impression on me that I at once went to Vienna to introduce myself to Herzl. I placed myself entirely at his disposal. From that moment till the last days of his fruitful life, unhappily so prematurely ended, I remained in uninterrupted intercourse with our never-to-be-forgotten leader. To devote my strength to the continuance of this work I regarded as the task of my life. When, in the sad time after Herzl's death, the Presidency was offered to me, I was surprised and embarrassed. It was only out of a sense of duty that I accepted this high dignity.\\"  References Further reading * J√ºdisches Lexikon, Berlin 1927, vol.

It was founded in 2001, becoming the first university institute in the world devoted specifically to crime science. The institute's current director is Richard Wortley. History The Jill Dando memorial garden in Weston-super-Mare In April 1999 the broadcaster Jill Dando was murdered outside her home in west London. Her colleague Nick Ross proposed a memorial to her in the form of a new university institution in her name. Ross had already conceived of crime science as a new discipline which distinguished itself from criminology by focusing on crime prevention, scientific methodology and multidisciplinary approach. He and Dando's fianc√©, Alan Farthing, established the Jill Dando Fund with the help of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens, the Countess of Wessex, and her family and friends. On 15 March 2000 the Jill Dando Fund was launched in London at Claridge's hotel, followed by the launch of the Jill Dando Fund Appeal on 12 September 2000. The appeal raised ¬£1.5 million and UCL was selected to host the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science. Gloria Laycock, OBE was appointed as the first director of the institute in January 2001. The institute was opened on 26 April 2001, the second anniversary of Jill Dando's murder, when Prof Laycock gave her inaugural speech as director. In May 2004 the institute established new scholarships for its MSc in crime science. In 2005 a Security and Crime Science Centre was established at the institute to work with industry partners in creating new approaches to counter terrorism. In the same year the International Crime Science Network was established. The institute published research in May 2006 which showed that the UK and France are perceived to have the worst problems with anti-social behaviour in Europe. The Centre for Security and Crime Science opened in October 2006. In 2009 UCL established the Department of Security and Crime Science as a separate entity from the institute in order to enable the offering of post-graduate taught and research courses in security and crime science. The institute continued as a cross- departmental research institute in security and crime science. In September 2009 the Home Office was criticised after it drew up timescales for how long DNA samples should be retained based on research by the institute that had not yet been finished. Research The main portico of University College London The institute was awarded over ¬£3 million in research and consultancy funding between 2001 and 2007.

CIS offers the International Baccalaureate Primary (IB PYP), Middle Years (IB MYP) and Diploma (IB DP) programmes to students from Nursery to Grade 12. History The Canadian International School was established in 1990 as a university preparatory day school and was named the Canadian Overseas College, but subsequently changed its name to the Canadian International School. In its first year, the school opened with a population of only six high school students and six staff members. Today, the Canadian International School has two campuses ‚Äì the Lakeside campus in Singapore's west (Nursery to Grade 12), and the Tanjong Katong campus in the east (Nursery to Grade 6). Before these two campuses, the school operated a campus located at 5 Toh Tuck Rd. The Toh Tuck campus (Nursery to Grade 3) was closed in 2011 and all students were moved to the aforementioned Lakeside campus for the next school year. In June 2020, it was announced that China Maple Leaf Educational Systems Ltd had agreed to acquire CIS in a deal valued at S$680 million. CIS curriculum and faculty Canadian International School's curriculum is delivered within the International Baccalaureate framework. The CIS educational programme consists of five elements: Academics, Athletics and Activities, Service and Leadership, Outdoor Learning, and Arts and Creativity; students spend the majority of the school day in the Academic element. Global Language Programme CIS's academic programme is delivered in English and learning an additional language is a requirement of the curriculum. Daily language lessons start in junior kindergarten. Students whose first language is not English will be supported by an English language learner programme. A range of mother tongue and additional languages are available in the after-school activities programme. The additional language programme develops students' linguistic capabilities, providing them with the necessary skills to compete on the world stage. The language choices are: *Immersion programme in Chinese or English - Pre- Kindergarten *Daily Chinese or French acquisition classes - Junior Kindergarten to Grade 10 *Bilingual Chinese-English programme (junior kindergarten to grade 6), French-English programme - Grade 1 and Grade 2 (Lakeside only) *Additional Language Classes in Chinese, French or Spanish STEAM STEAM integrates the areas of science, technology, entrepreneurship, arts and mathematics. STEAM at CIS is taught across the entire school from Kindergarten to Grade 12. Outdoor Learning Outdoor learning used to see students goes beyond the traditional classroom to learn. However current expansion plans have removed all outdoor learning environments and left the students with outdoor education in the bus bay. Primary students spend a week a year in a variety of real-world settings. Excursion week sees students in Grades 4 to 11 exploring countries such as Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, China and Cambodia. Faculty The Canadian International School's faculty is one of the finest, with over 60% of staff holding advanced or double degrees.  Bilingual Programme Singapore  The school offers two bilingual programmes. The Chinese-English bilingual programme is provided at both Tanjong Katong and Jurong West campuses from kindergarten to grade 6, while the French-English programme is offered in grades 1 and 2 at Lakeside only. The programme is structured so that students attend alternate days of Chinese or French then English.  Campuses = Tanjong Katong Campus  The Tanjong Katong Campus was opened in September 2007 on the former site of the Tanjong Katong Girls' School. Block C of the Tanjong Katong campus is a Singapore Heritage listed site. Angela Henderson is the current principal of the campus.  Jurong West Campus  The Lakeside campus, set on 43,000 sq.m. of land, provides students with facilities that include classrooms connected to learning pods, academic facilities, sporting, outdoor and playground facilities, as well as a performing and fine arts centre, 500-seat theatre, Olympic-sized swimming pool, maker spaces and a two-storey library. (Green Berg International School) It also features a 2,011-sqm outdoor learning play area meant for students aged three to six that includes sand and water areas to support play-based learning.

Currently available systems (as of October, 2020) can only deliver (and regulate delivery of) a single hormone- insulin. Other systems currently in development aim to improve on current systems by adding one or more additional hormones that can be delivered as needed, providing something closer to the endocrine functionality of a healthy pancreas. The endocrine functionality of the pancreas is provided by islet cells which produce the hormones insulin and glucagon. Artificial pancreatic technology mimics the secretion of these hormones into the bloodstream in response to the body's changing blood glucose levels. Maintaining balanced blood sugar levels is crucial to the function of the brain, liver, and kidneys. Therefore, for type 1 patients, it is necessary that the levels be kept balanced when the body cannot produce insulin itself. Automated insulin delivery systems are often referred to using the term artificial pancreas, but the term has no precise, universally accepted definition. For uses other than automated insulin delivery, see Artificial pancreas (disambiguation). General Overview=History The first automated insulin delivery system was known as the Biostator. Classes of AID systems Currently available AID systems fall into four broad classes based on their capabilities. The first systems released- suspend systems- can only halt insulin delivery. Loop systems can modulate delivery both up and down. =Threshold suspend= Threshold suspend systems are the simplest form of insulin delivery automation. They halt the constant flow of insulin from a pump (known as basal insulin) when a connected CGM reports a glucose level below a pre-set threshold. Halting basal delivery stops the normal preprogrammed rate of delivery, but it cannot remove insulin that has already been infused, so the overall efficacy of threshold suspend systems is limited due to the relatively slow pharmacokinetics of insulin delivered subcutaneously. =Predictive Low Glucose Suspend= A step forward from threshold suspend systems, Predictive Low Glucose Suspend (PLGS) systems use a mathematical model to extrapolate predicted future blood sugar levels based on recent past readings from a CGM. This allows the system to halt insulin delivery as much as 30 minutes prior to a predicted hypoglycemic event, allowing addition time for the slow pharmacokinetics of insulin to reflect that delivery has been halted. =Hybrid Closed Loop= Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) systems further expand on the capabilities of PGLS systems by adjusting basal insulin delivery rates both up and down in response to values from a continuous glucose monitor. Through this modulation of basal insulin, the system is able to reduce the magnitude and duration both hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events. =Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop= In addition to modulating basal insulin, Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop systems have the ability to deliver boluses of insulin to correct for elevated blood sugar. Required Components An automated insulin delivery system consists of three distinct components: a continuous glucose monitor to determine blood sugar levels, a pump to deliver insulin, and an algorithm that uses the data from the CGM to send commands to the pump. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows each component to be approved independently, allowing for more rapid approvals and incremental innovation. Each component is discussed in greater detail below. =Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)= alt= Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are medical devices which extrapolate an estimate of the glucose concentration in a patient's blood based on the level of glucose present in the subcutaneous interstitial fluid. A thin, biocompatible sensor wire coated with a glucose-reactive enzyme is inserted into the skin, allowing the system to read the voltage generated, and based on it, estimate blood glucose. The biggest advantage of a CGM over a traditional fingerstick blood glucose meter is that the CGM can take a new reading as often as every 60 seconds (although most only take a reading every 5 minutes), allowing for a sampling frequency that is able to provide not just a current blood sugar level, but a record of past measurements; allowing computer systems to project past short-term trends into the future, showing patients where their blood sugar levels are likely headed. Early CGMs were not particularly accurate, but were still useful for observing and recording overall trends and provide warnings in the event of rapid changes in blood glucose readings. Continuous blood glucose monitors are one of the set of devices that make up an artificial pancreas device system, the other being an insulin pump, and a glucose meter to calibrate the device. Continuous glucose monitors are a more recent breakthrough and have begun to hit the markets for patient use after approval from the FDA. Both the traditional and the continuous monitor require manual insulin delivery or carbohydrate intake depending on the readings from the devices. While the traditional blood glucose meters require the user to prick their finger every few hours to obtain data, continuous monitors use sensors placed just under the skin on the arm or abdomen to deliver blood sugar level data to receivers or smartphone apps as often as every few minutes. The sensors can be used for up to fourteen days. A number of different continuous monitors are currently approved by the FDA. The first continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was approved in December 2016. Developed by Dexcom, the G5 Mobile Continuous Monitoring System requires users to prick their fingers twice a day (as opposed to the typical average 8 times daily with the traditional meters) in order to calibrate the sensors. The sensors last up to seven days. The device uses Bluetooth technology to warn the user either through a handheld receiver or app on a smartphone if blood glucose levels reach below a certain point. The cost for this device excluding any co-insurance is an estimated $4,800 a year. Blood glucose meter FreeStyle Libre from Abbott. Abbott Laboratories' FreeStyle Libre CGM was approved in September 2017. Recently, the technology was modified to support smartphone use through the LibreLink app. This device does not require finger pricks at all and the sensor, placed on the upper arm, lasts 14 days. The estimated cost for this monitor is $1,300 a year. Dexcom's next G6 model CGM was approved in March 2018, which can last up to ten days and does not need finger prick calibration. Like Medtronic's monitor, it can predict glucose level trends. It is compatible for integration into insulin pumps. =Control Algorithm=Insulin PumpCurrently Available Systems=Do-It-YourselfCommercial MiniMed 670G = In September 2016, the FDA approved the Medtronic MiniMed 670G, which was the first approved hybrid closed loop system. The device senses a diabetic person's basal insulin requirement and automatically adjusts its delivery to the body. It is made up of a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin pump, and a glucose meter for calibration. It automatically functions to modify the level of insulin delivery based on the detection of blood glucose levels by continuous monitor. It does this by sending the blood glucose data through an algorithm that analyzes and makes the subsequent adjustments. The system has two modes. Manual mode lets the user choose the rate at which basal insulin is delivered. Auto mode regulates basal insulin levels from the continuous monitor's readings every five minutes. The device was originally available only to those aged 14 or older, and in June 2018 was approved by the FDA for use in children aged 7‚Äì14. Families have reported better sleep quality from use of the new system, as they do not have to worry about manually checking blood glucose levels during the night. The full cost of the system is $3700, but patients have the opportunity to get it for less. Systems in Development=Ilet Bionic Pancreas A team at Boston University working in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital on a dual hormone artificial pancreas system began clinical trials on their device called the Bionic Pancreas in 2008. In 2016, the Public Benefit Corporation Beta Bionics was formed. In conjunction with the formation of the company, Beta Bionics changed the preliminary name for their device from the Bionic Pancreas to the iLet. The device uses a closed-loop system to deliver both insulin and glucagon in response to sensed blood glucose levels. While not yet approved for public use, the 4th generation iLet prototype, presented in 2017, is around the size of an iPhone, with a touchscreen interface. It contains two chambers for both insulin and glucagon, and the device is configurable for use with only one hormone, or both. While trials continue to be run, the iLet has a projected final approval for the insulin-only system in 2020. Inreda Diabetic In collaboration with the Academic Medical Centre (AMC) in Amsterdam, Inreda is developing a closed loop system with insulin and glucagon. The initiator, Robin Koops, started to develop the device in 2004 and ran the first tests on himself. After several highly successful trials it received the European EC license in 2016. The product is expected to market in the second half of 2020. A smaller improved version is scheduled for 2023. Approaches=Medical equipment The medical equipment approach involves combining a continuous glucose monitor and an implanted insulin pump that can function together with a computer- controlled algorithm to replace the normal function of the pancreas. The development of continuous glucose monitors has led to the progress in artificial pancreas technology using this integrated system. =Closed-loop systems= Unlike the continuous sensor alone, the closed-loop system requires no user input in response to reading from the monitor; the monitor and insulin pump system automatically delivers the correct amount of hormone calculated from the readings transmitted. The system is what makes up the artificial pancreas device. Current studies Four studies on different artificial pancreas systems are being conducted starting in 2017 and going into the near future. The projects are funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and are the final part of testing the devices before applying for approval for use. Participants in the studies are able to live their lives at home while using the devices and being monitored remotely for safety, efficacy, and a number of other factors. The International Diabetes Closed-Loop trial, led by researchers from the University of Virginia, is testing a closed-loop system called inControl, which has a smartphone user interface. 240 people of ages 14 and up are participating for 6 months. A full-year trial led by researchers from the University of Cambridge started in May 2017 and has enrolled an estimated 150 participants of ages 6 to 18 years. The artificial pancreas system being studied uses a smartphone and has a low glucose feature to improve glucose level control. The International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in collaboration with Schneider Children's Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Israel, are planning a 6-month study that will begin in early 2019 and will involve 112 adolescents and young adults, ages 14 to 30. The main object of the study is to compare the current Medtronic 670G system to a new Medtronic-developed system. The new system has programming that aims to improve glucose control around mealtime, which is still a big challenge in the field. The current 6-month study lead by the Bionic Pancreas team started in mid-2018 and enrolled 312 participants of ages 18 and above.  Physiological  bio- engineered tissue with encapsulated islet cells which deliver endocrine hormones in response to glucose. The biotechnical company Defymed, based in France, is developing an implantable bio-artificial device called MailPan which features a bio-compatible membrane with selective permeability to encapsulate different cell types, including pancreatic beta cells. The implantation of the device does not require conjunctive immuno-suppressive therapy because the membrane prevents antibodies of the patient from entering the device and damaging the encapsulated cells. After being surgically implanted, the membrane sheet will be viable for years. The cells that the device holds can be produced from stem cells rather than human donors, and may also be replaced over time using input and output connections without surgery. Defymed is partially funded by JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, but is now defined as an organization for all ages and all stages of type 1 diabetes. In November 2018, it was announced that Defymed would partner with the Israel-based Kadimastem, a bio-pharmaceutical company developing stem-cell based regenerative therapies, to receive a two-year grant worth approximately $1.47 million for the development of a bio-artificial pancreas that would treat type 1 diabetes. Kadimastem's stem cell technology uses differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to obtain pancreatic endocrine cells. These include insulin-producing beta cells, as well as alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Both cells arrange in islet-like clusters, mimicking the structure of the pancreas. The aim of the partnership is to combine both technologies in a bio-artificial pancreas device, which releases insulin in response to blood glucose levels, to bring to clinical trial stages. The San Diego, California based biotech company ViaCyte has also developed a product aiming to provide a solution for type 1 diabetes which uses an encapsulation device made of a semi-permeable immune reaction- protective membrane. The device contains pancreatic progenitor cells that have been differentiated from embryonic stem cells. After surgical implantation in an outpatient procedure, the cells mature into endocrine cells which arrange in islet-like clusters and mimic the function of the pancreas, producing insulin and glucagon. The technology advanced from pre-clinical studies to FDA approval for phase 1 clinical trials in 2014, and presented two-year data from the trial in June 2018. They reported that their product, called PEC-Encap, has so far been safe and well tolerated in patients at a dose below therapeutic levels. The encapsulated cells were able to survive and mature after implantation, and immune system rejection was decreased due to the protective membrane. The second phase of the trial will evaluate the efficacy of the product. ViaCyte has also been receiving financial support from JDRF on this project. Initiatives around the globe In the United States in 2006, JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) launched a multi- year initiative to help accelerate the development, regulatory approval, and acceptance of continuous glucose monitoring and artificial pancreas technology.Artificial Pancreas Project : JDRF Grassroots efforts to create and commercialize a fully automated artificial pancreas system have also arisen directly from patient advocates and the diabetes community.Hurley, Dan (24 December 2014) WIRED Magazine, Diabetes Patients Are Hacking Their Way Toward a Bionic Pancreas Bigfoot Biomedical, a company founded by parents of children with T1D have created algorithms and are developing a closed loop device that monitor blood sugar and appropriately provide insulin.Knutson, Ryan (8 June 2015) The Wall Street Journal, Computer Experts Deliver Insulin to Diabetic Kids  References  Insulin therapies Biomedical engineering Biological engineering Implants (medicine) Diabetes-related supplies and medical equipment Prosthetics Pancreas ","title":"Automated insulin delivery systems"},{"id":"6313543","text":"Ian Brooker is a character actor, with experience of theatre, television and film.

Statutes of repose exist in a number of contexts. Some jurisdictions have passed statutes of repose in the context of products liability law, or for probate court proceedings. Difference from a statute of limitations A statute of repose is distinct from a statute of limitations, though their effects are very similar. Deadlines imposed by a statute of repose are enforced much more strictly than those of a statute of limitations. In contrast to a statute of limitations, a statute of repose \\"is designed to bar actions after a specified period of time has run from the occurrence of some event other than the injury which gave rise to the claim.\\" *A statute of limitations focuses on requiring timeliness of action from an injured party, and thus may potentially be extended where a delay in commencing a legal action is not the injured party's fault. The operation of a statute of limitations can be avoided or tolled by a number of equitable factors, such as the minority of the injured party, or attempts by a tortfeasor to conceal evidence of responsibility. Some statutes of limitations begin to run only when the injured party discovers or reasonably should have discovered the injury. * A statute of repose focuses on immunizing the alleged injuring party from long-term liability, and thus may even be based on elapsed time from an event, even if the potential cause of action cannot reasonably be discovered until a later date. In simple terms, a statute of limitations may start to run at a date other than when a wrongful act or omission allegedly occurred, or may be extended based upon factors that delay the reasonable discovery of an injury or the plaintiff's ability to take action, while a statute of repose is triggered by the completion of an act and is not ordinarily subject to extension or exception. For example, many U.S. states have laws that provide that when a construction project is \\"substantially completed,\\" meaning that just those items on a \\"punch list\\" remain, a statute of repose starts to run for claims relating to defective design or construction. Although a statute of limitations and a statute of repose are different, the two concepts are sometimes confused, even by legislatures in their enactment of statutes. In a U.S. court case that reached the nation's Supreme Court, the court took note of the failure of Congress to consistently observe the distinction when drafting laws: : While the term \\"statute of limitations\\" has acquired a precise meaning, distinct from \\"statute of repose,\\" and while that is its primary meaning, it must be acknowledged that the term \\"statute of limitations\\" is sometimes used in a less formal way. In that sense, it can refer to any provision restricting the time in which a plaintiff must bring suit. ... Congress has used the term \\"statute of limitations\\" when enacting statutes of repose. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 78u-6(h)(1)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) (2012 ed.) (creating a statute of repose and placing it in a provision entitled \\"Statute of limitations\\"); 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 2278 (same). And petitioner does not point out an example in which Congress has used the term \\"statute of repose.\\" So the Court must proceed to examine other evidence of the meaning of the term \\"statute of limitations\\" as it is used in ¬ß 9658. In many cases, both a statute of limitations and a statute of repose will apply to the same case, and a statute of repose may cut off liability even if the statute of limitations has not run. For example, a defect in an airplane might cause a crash twelve years after the date of initial sale, with the statute of limitations for a personal injury claim commencing on the date of the crash, but where a ten-year statute of repose on product liability claims will have already expired. The earlier expiration of the statute of repose will prevent the personal injury claim even before the statute of limitations starts to run. In product liability Product liability involves the potential liability of manufacturers, distributors and retailers for injuries that result from dangerous or defective products. For example, a statute of repose may bar an action from being commenced after a specific number of years from the date when the product was initially delivered.See, for example, Ind. Code 34-20-3-1 A product liability statute of repose may bar a remedy even before a cause of action arises. For example, if a defective product first sold to a consumer more than ten years ago causes an injury, a ten-year statute of repose (that starts on the product's original date of purchase) might bar a claim even if the statute of limitations (which starts on the date of injury) does not. Because statutes of repose impose an absolute bar for actions against manufacturers, typically based on the date that allegedly defective goods are delivered or installed rather than the date when they cause harm, they are strongly favored over a statute of limitations by industry trade groups and opposed by consumer organizations and tort lawyers. In the United States, statutes of repose are a part of legislative proposals for \\"tort reform\\". In estate administration Many jurisdictions have statutes of repose that relate to the administration of decedents' estates. For example, legislatures often set deadlines for actions such as will contests, or for the submission of claims by creditors that the estate owes them money. If such a claim is not brought within the prescribed period of time under which the claimant or creditor is authorized to act, the claim becomes barred by statutes of repose.See, e.g., Sec. 29-1-14-1 of the Under a typical statute of repose, creditors of a decedent who do not act upon receiving actual or constructive notice that an estate has been opened have their claims cut off, and cannot disturb the peaceful possession of the distributed assets by the heirs. These probate statutes are less controversial than statutes of repose in injury and product liability cases, as public policy favors the distribution of estates to the heirs with all deliberate speed, and weighs against reopening estates trying to recover money from the heirs to whom it has already been distributed.

He also served as the Montreal Expos' General Manager from to , and was the Baltimore Orioles general manager with Mike Flanagan from to . As of , Beattie served as a professional scout in the Toronto Blue Jays organization through the 2018 season. Beattie retired from his decades-long career in the MLB at the end of the 2018 season. Beattie starred in baseball and basketball at South Portland High School in South Portland, Maine. Amateur career Beattie earned All New England honors playing basketball at Dartmouth College in , and was MVP of the Kodak Classic in . In 1974, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Professional career=New York Yankees He was drafted by the New York Yankees in the fourth round of the 1975 Major League Baseball draft, and was soon tabbed one of the top pitching prospects in the Yankees' farm system, along with Ken Clay and Gil Patterson. Each vocalized frustration with the organization when they acquired pitchers Rich Gossage, Andy Messersmith and Rawly Eastwick after the season believing that it hindered their chances of making the major league roster that Spring. That turned out not to be the case, as a rash of injuries opened the door for Beattie, and he made the club out of Spring training . He pitched 6.1 innings and gave up just one run in his major league debut to beat Hall of Famer Jim Palmer and the Baltimore Orioles. After a second win against the Chicago White Sox on May 15, Beattie lost his next seven decisions in a row. He was, however, on the mound for two of the Yankees' most important games that September. With the Yankees having been as far back as fourteen games to the Boston Red Sox on July 19, they surged to just four games back by the time they headed to Fenway Park for a four-game set from September 7-10\\\\. Beattie started the second game of the series, holding Boston to just three hits and no runs over his first eight innings of work. After the Red Sox scored two unearned runs in the ninth, he handed the ball over to Ron Davis for the final out. The Yankees swept the series to move into a tie with Boston. They moved on to Detroit for a three- game set next, and Beattie won game two of that series to give the Yankees sole possession of first place. Following a one-game playoff with the Red Sox, the Yankees headed into the postseason. Beattie won game one of the 1978 American League Championship Series against the Kansas City Royals, and earned a complete game victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in game five of the World Series. Despite his late season and postseason heroics, Beattie failed to make the club the following Spring. He was, however, called up by the beginning of May. On June 20, a line drive off the bat of the Toronto Blue Jays' John Mayberry shelved Beattie for two months. On September 12, , Boston Red Sox legend Carl Yastrzemski singled off Beattie for his 3,000th career hit. After the season, he, Rick Anderson, Juan Ben√≠quez and Jerry Narron were traded to the Seattle Mariners for Ruppert Jones and Jim Lewis. Seattle Mariners Despite a high 5.01 earned run average, Beattie's record stood at 3-3 on May 21, following a victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. He only won two more games for the rest of the season, and finished at 5-15 with a 4.85 ERA. He started the season in the bullpen, but after getting rocked in three outings, was reassigned to the triple A Pacific Coast League Spokane Indians. He returned to the majors after the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, and pitch an eight inning gem against the California Angels on August 11 for his first victory of the season. Beattie went 3-2 with one save with a 2.02 ERA while holding batters to a .212 batting average in the second half, as opposed to the eight earned runs he gave up in 4.1 innings of work prior to his demotion to Spokane. His success carried over into the seasons. Despite an 8-12 record, his 3.34 ERA was seventh best in the American League, 140 strikeouts was eighth best, and the .233 batting average he held batters to was sixth best. On September 27, , Beattie hurled the first one-hitter in Seattle Mariners history against the Kansas City Royals. Outside of a U.L. Washington single in the third inning, Beattie was perfect. Perhaps the second best pitching performance of his career came in a losing effort. On July 25, , he and the California Angels' Ron Romanick locked up in a pitchers' duel. Beattie pitched eight innings of one hit ball while striking out nine. With the game still scoreless heading into extra innings, Beattie took the mound again in the tenth inning. Gary Pettis ended it with a two out single in the tenth. After the game, Beattie smashed a water cooler and refused to talk to reporters. Beattie began dealing with shoulder tendinitis late in his career. He missed six weeks of the season with tendinitis, then tore his rotator cuff upon his return. He returned from surgery midway through the season. He pitched effectively in his first start against the Chicago White Sox, and was in line for the victory until the bullpen imploded. From there, Beattie himself imploded as he went 0-6 with a 6.02 ERA through August 7, when he was placed back on the disabled list. Post-playing career Rather than trying to catch on with another big league club after being released by the Mariners, Beattie opted to go back to school. He received his M.B.A. from the University of Washington in , (he also has a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth) then returned to the Mariners as their player development director in . He remained in that position through the 1995 season, when he was named general manager and vice president of the Montreal Expos. He quit at the end of the season; after a year away from the game, he joined the Baltimore Orioles as executive vice president of baseball operations. He served as co-GM of the Orioles with former Orioles pitcher Mike Flanagan through the season, when Flanagan was given the job solely. When Boston Red Sox GM Theo Epstein threatened to leave the Red Sox shortly afterwards, Beattie interviewed for the job. He also interviewed for the vacant Houston Astros GM job in . In something of an unexpected career turn, Beattie finished the 2007 season as the Florida Marlins' bullpen coach. After former bullpen coach Steve Foster moved into the pitching coach position following Rick Kranitz's departure, Beattie jokingly offered his services to Marlins GM Larry Beinfest. Beinfest took him up on his offer.

Culture The indigenous people of the Gazelle Peninsula are mostly concentrated within the Rabaul caldera, particularly the town of Rabaul. Ethnically the people are typically of Melanesian descent and are referred to as Tolai by title of government. A second and less common indigenous people referred to as Baining, are semi- nomadic and tend to live in the Baining Mountains. They are distinct from the Tolai's Melanesian ethnicity. The Tolai are regarded as being the most successful people of Papua New Guinea; defined by wealth, sophistication, adaptation to modern culture, and instinct for trade. In Tolai society, currency is used in similar fashion to coin via the medium known as tambu, a shell. Tambu can be bound together as coils to form alternative values and may be used to purchase goods in the Gazelle Peninsula. Marriage for Tolai is typically handled in economic fashion between two groups known as moieties and the son of one family is responsible for paying the bride-price in tambu to the family of the daughter. Marriage of two people within the same moiety is not allowed and the bride-price is generally determined by family status and wealth of the daughter.Trevitt, J.W. (1940).

The characters were usually depicted as members of incarnations of the supervillain group, the Zodiac. In the history of the Marvel Universe, seven different characters have assumed the role of Aries. All of them have been members of the villainous Zodiac and used horns on their head to ram their opponents. The third Aries was a Life Model Decoy created by Jake Fury. The second and fourth Aries' were African- American. Publication history The original human Aries, Marcus Lassiter, first appeared in The Avengers #72 (January 1970), and was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Sal Buscema. The character subsequently appears in Avengers #82 (November 1970), in which he is killed. The second human Aries, Grover Raymond, first appeared in The Avengers #120-123 (February‚ÄìMay 1974), and was created by Steve Englehart and Bob Brown. The character subsequently appears in Ghost Rider #7 (August 1974), and Captain America #177-178 (September‚ÄìOctober 1974), in which he is killed. Aries appeared as part of the \\"Zodiac\\" entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #20. Fictional character biography=Marcus Lassiter Nothing is known about how Lassiter joined the Cartel or any of his dealings with their group prior to their first battle with the Avengers. In order to take down the Zodiac Cartel Nick Fury, disguised as Scorpio captured the Avengers. He called the Cartel for a meeting in order to present the Avengers to them. The Avengers managed to break free before the Cartel could execute them. Fury unmasked himself and joined the heroes in fighting off the Zodiac Cartel. Aries managed to claim the Zodiac Key, and led the Cartel to their escape through a hole in the wall.Avengers #72 Lassiter led the reorganization of the Cartel and its planning to take over Manhattan. A mercenary group in the Zodiac's employ was sent to Avengers Mansion and was able to subdue the Avengers who were subsequently put into stasis. The Aries-led Zodiac army was able to take over Manhattan. Aries used the Zodiac Key to entrapping it within a force field. The Cartel demanded one billion dollars or they threatened to kill the entire population of Manhattan. The Black Panther and Daredevil managed to free the Avengers, and, in the ensuing battle, Aries was apparently slain. Thor destroyed his vessel with a bolt of lightning. The rest of the Zodiac Cartel escaped capture.Avengers #82 Grover Raymond Grover Raymond was recruited by Taurus to replace Marcus Lassiter as Aries. The Zodiac Cartel decided to kill every person born under the sign of Gemini because they thought them to be untrustworthy. The Cartel was defeated by the Avengers who were able to destroy the Star-Blaster which the Zodiac was to use to fulfill their plans. Following their defeat, Raymond was able to get the rest of the Cartel, except for Libra to back him in overthrowing Taurus as their leader. The renegade Zodiac met with Cornelius Van Lunt, the Cartel's financial backer, in an empty warehouse but were attacked by the Avengers during the meeting. Van Lunt fled, but revealed that he was Taurus and that the warehouse was, in fact, a rocketship which Taurus shot into space. The Vision was able to persuade the Zodiac to help the Avengers get back to earth rather than continue their battle. Upon their return to earth, the Avengers turned Aries and the other Zodiac, except for Libra, over to the authorities. Except for Taurus, all the Cartel ended up in prison.Avengers #120-122 While in prison, Raymond was visited by Lucifer, who had possessed the body of Rafe Michel, a criminal. In order to keep his power from consuming a single body, Lucifer offered to divide his power. Raymond agreed, and gained some of Lucifer's strength, along with his costume. They did battle with the Falcon, but managed to escape to Mr. Morgan. Morgan asked the two to kill the Falcon.Captain America #177 The two Lucifers attacked, but were defeated by the Falcon. Raymond-Lucifer led the other to Lucifer's base, where they revived Lucifer's undamaged Ultra-Robots and sent them to attack the Falcon. The Falcon, though, was helped by an uncostumed Captain America, who defeated the Lucifers and destroyed the Ultra-Robots. Still unable to contain Lucifer's energies, both host bodies died with Lucifer being sent back to the Nameless Dimension.Captain America #178 LMD This version of Aries was a Life Model Decoy created along with an entirely new Zodiac in the Theatre of Genetics by Scorpio (aka Jake Fury). The Defenders attacked the Theatre and Scorpio was forced to activated the LMD Zodiac prematurely. The Aries LMD rushed into battle but was hampered by his clumsiness and recklessness. During the battle Moon Knight and Nighthawk were able to cause Aries to slam into a wall knocking it unconscious. The Aries LMD was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody following the battle.Defenders #48-50 Later, Aries and the rest of the LMD Zodiac, led by Quicksilver, battled the Avengers whom Quicksilver was attempting to frame for treason. During an underwater battle near Avengers Mansion with a team of the heroes, the Aries and Taurus LMDs were flung out into the river and apprehended by the authorities.West Coast Avengers Annual #1 After being released from prison, Aries and the rest of the LMD Zodiac attacked and killed all the human Zodiac Cartel except for Cornelius Van Lunt (aka Taurus). Soon after the LMD Zodiac attempted to rob the Denver Mint, but were interrupted by the West Coast Avengers. During the battle the Scorpio LMD brought both the Zodiac and the Avengers to the Ankh Dimension, but this had the unwanted result of shutting down all the LMDs, leaving them immobile in that foreign dimension.West Coast Avengers Vol. 2 #26-28 Oscar Gordon Not much is known about this version of Aries or how he joined the Zodiac Cartel. He likely was invited by Cornelius Van Lunt as done previously. Taurus later the second version of Aquarius and this incarnation of Aries tried to kill Iron Man (James Rhodes), but both failed. In their battle, Aries was defeated and turned over to the authorities.Iron Man #183-185 He was killed by the LMD versions of the Zodiac.Avengers: Forever #2 Ecliptic Aries This incarnation of Aries was a product of genetic engineering recruited by Scorpio who was working for the Ecliptic. This version of Zodiac was sent by Scorpio to steal the Nth Projector from Department H. During their mission they were attacked and defeated by Alpha Flight, but were able to escape.Alpha Flight (Vol. 2) #12 (July 1998) Soon after, the Director of Weapon X sent a Weapon X team to the Zodiac's castle headquarters to retrieve Madison Jeffries who had become one of the Zodiac's Gemini twins. The Zodiac were defeated and Jeffries was recovered. The Zodiac were drained of their life energy by Sauron and, after the creature had left, Weapon X blew up the castle leaving the Zodiac for dead.Alpha Flight (Vol. 2) #19 (Feb 1999) Thanos' Aries The sixth Aries is a criminal recruited and empowered by Thanos to recover various alien artifacts scattered around Earth.Avengers Assemble Vol. 2 #1-2 (March - April 2012) He battles the Avengers with the rest of the new Zodiac organization, but is eventually de-powered when Thanos no longer needs him leaving him and the other Zodiac members for dead on the self-destructing Helicarrier.Avengers Assemble Vol. 2 #4 (June 2012) Marauders' Aries A mutant version of Aries appears as a member of Mister Sinister's Marauders. He was traveling through the sewers with his fellow Marauders in an attempt to capture Nightcrawler. He found Nightcrawler and charged at him with his horns only for Nightcrawler to teleport the both of them where Aries ran straight into his teammates Azimuth, Chimera, and Coda. A fight broke out until Nightcrawler was knocked out by Azimuth.Extraordinary X-Men #1 Powers and abilities The first and second Aries wore a pair of ram's horns upon their heads which they could use to ram opponents in battle. The second often carried a Star-Blazer, a pistol which could fire energy blasts. While possessed by Lucifer, his body was charged with ionic energy, granting him superhuman strength.Captain America #177-178 The third Aries possessed a pair of horns on its head, enhanced strength, and would attempt to ram its opponents in battle. In its most recent form, it also wore a suit of protective armor, and could project fire from its horns. As a LMD, it could also exist underwater. The fourth Aries wore horns on his head which he could use to ram opponents. The fifth Aries, as with all Aries, had horns on his head which he could use to ram opponents. The sixth Aries possessed superhuman strength, had horns, wielded a gun, and used the Zodiac's teleportation. The seventh Aries wore a special suit provided by Thanos which gave him super-strength and enabled him to assume the form of a humanoid ram. In other media=Television * Aries appears in The Avengers: United They Stand, voiced by Tony Daniels. He is a member of the Zodiacs and is depicted as a super-strong alien that wears a ram-horned helmet. * Aries appears in the Marvel Anime: Iron Man episode \\"Reap the Whirlwind\\". This version is a tornado-controlling robot which is responsible for killing Professors Ohno and Satoshi Yamaguchi. When Iron Man confronts Aries during its attack on a military base, Aries easily defeats Iron Man. Aries later attacks Dr. Chika Tanaka, Professor Michelini, and Nanami Ota at his house which ends with the professor's supposed death. It turns out that Michelini was the one responsible for providing the Tesla project information to Zodiac, which was a research initiative in weather manipulation. Aries then unleashes two F-5 tornadoes at Yokasuka Base as Michelini is sucked up into the tornado. With his armor repaired, Tony Stark becomes Iron Man and enter the tornado with the upgraded EMP cannon. Using the EMP cannon, Iron Man defeats Aries who crashes to the ground. * Aries is featured in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"For Your Eyes Only\\". The foot soldiers of Aries are depicted as wearing ram masks.

It is found off southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand from the intertidal zone to a depth of . This bottom-dweller inhabits soft-bottomed habitats such as lagoons, estuaries, and reefs. Growing to across and over in weight, the thorntail stingray is among the largest stingrays in the world. Uniformly dark above and light below, it has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc and a very long, whip-like tail with a fin fold underneath. The upper surface of the disc and the tail bear numerous stout, sharp thorns. The diet of the thorntail stingray consists of benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It has been known to gather in large groups during summertime. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained to term by histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") produced by the mother. The venomous stinging spine of the thorntail stingray can inflict a painful injury, though it is not aggressive towards humans. It is caught by commercial and recreational fishers, though the impact of such activities on its population is unknown. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient. A Thorntail stingray with a width of 1.67m and length of 2.35m was caught and released of Warner Beach, South Africa in Jan 2020. Taxonomy A thorntail stingray at Green Island, New South Wales. Australian ichthyologist James Douglas Ogilby originally described the thorntail stingray from four specimens collected off New South Wales during the 1898 scientific expedition of the trawler HMCS Thetis, after which the species was named. His account was published a year later in the scientific journal Memoirs of the Australian Museum. Other common names for this species include black skate, black stingaree, long-tailed stingaree, longtail black stingray, thorn stingray, and thorntail ray. Distribution and habitat The thorntail stingray is found off southern Africa from Algoa Bay, South Africa to Barra da Falsa, Mozambique and R√©union, as well as off Australia from Shark Bay to northern New South Wales, Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, and New Zealand. It is fairly common off Australia and New Zealand and less so elsewhere. Favoring inshore habitats with soft bottoms, this benthic species is commonly encountered in estuaries and lagoons, around rocky and coral reefs, and over reef flats. In Australia, it has been known to swim up rivers. Off New Zealand, large groups of thorntail stingrays have been seen inside caves and beneath rocky arches. This species is known to occur as deep as . Description The presence of numerous thorns on the back and tail are a characteristic trait of the thorntail stingray. One of the largest members of its family, the thorntail stingray reaches at least long, across, and in weight. This species has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc about one-fourth wider than long, with sinuous leading margins converging to a slightly protruding snout tip and rounded outer and trailing margins. The mouth is slightly arched; there are five papillae across the floor with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. The tooth rows number 25‚Äì43 in the upper jaw and 29‚Äì48 in the lower jaw, and are arranged with a quincunx pattern into pavement-like surfaces. The pelvic fins have rounded tips and gently curved trailing margins. The whip-like tail measures about twice the length of the disc and bears one or two long stinging spines with up to 88 serrations. A narrow fin fold runs beneath the tail and ends well before the tail tip. Large juveniles and adults have a row of large, sharp thorns running along the midline of the back from behind the eyes to the tail spine, and thorns of various sizes are also scattered about the dorsal surface of the disc. The tail behind the spine is densely covered by stout thorns. This species is a uniform dark brown or gray to black above and whitish below. The longer tail, presence of thorns, and absence of white dots atop the disc differentiate this species from the short-tail stingray (D. brevicaudata), another giant stingray that shares its range. Biology and ecology Thorntail stingrays often rest on the bottom during the day. During the day, thorntail stingrays are often seen resting on patches of sand.Anthoni, J.F. (2007). The mystery of the social sting rays. Seafriends. Retrieved on January 7, 2010. This species preys mainly upon crabs, mantis shrimp, bivalves, polychaete worms, and conger eels. Off New Zealand, both it and the short-tail stingray regularly fall prey to local killer whales (Orcinus orca). A known parasite of this species is the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti. Thorntail stingrays have been reported to congregate in warm, shallow waters during the summer, possibly for reproductive purposes. This species is aplacental viviparous like other stingrays. Human interactions The tail spine of the thorntail stingray is potentially injurious to humans. It is reportedly unaggressive and approachable, and can be conditioned to accept being \\"ridden\\" by divers. At Hamelin Bay, Western Australia, many thorntail stingrays, short-tail stingrays, and Australian bull rays (Myliobatis australis) regularly gather to be hand-fed fish scraps; the number of visitors has steadily increased in recent years, and there is interest in developing the site as a permanent tourist attraction. Thorntail stingrays are caught as bycatch in nets and on line gear, probably in low numbers. Most individuals landed are discarded, though the rate of survival after capture is unknown, as this species may be subject to persecution by fishery workers. Recreational anglers sometimes hook this ray, which may be difficult to bring in due to its size. At present, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient information to assess the thorntail stingray beyond Data Deficient. From 1986 to 1997, New Zealand reported an average annual catch of 15 tons for this species and the short-tail stingray combined, though this figure may underestimate the total fishery impact. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the thorntail stingray as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifier \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

Personal life He was born in Mandal as a son of bailiff and politician Arne Askildsen (1898‚Äì1982) and Aasta H√•verstad (1898‚Äì1978). Before the Second World War his father was the bailiff of Mandal and Halse og Harkmark from 1928, a board member of the Norwegian Lutheran Mission since 1939, and also a member of the school board and city council. During the war and occupation of Norway, his father was imprisoned in Arkivet twice, before escaping to Sweden in 1944. Two older brothers of Kjell Askildsen were held captive in Grini concentration camp. After the war, Askildsen enrolled in the Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany. He was married to a German woman for some time. From August 1951 to March 1968 he was married to Edith Dorothea Mathiessen, and from June 1992 he has been married to Gina Giertsen. Writing career His first book, the short story collection Heretter f√∏lger jeg deg helt hjem (1953), raised controversy, especially in Mandal, for its sexual content.http://www.literaturfestival.com/archive/participants/authors/2009/kjell- askildsen?set_language=en After that book, Asklildsen concentrated mainly on novels. He was awarded the Mads Wiel Nygaards Endowment in recognition of his novel, Omgivelser (1969), which was made into the 1973 movie Maria Marusjka, directed by Oddvar Bull Tuhus and starring Peter Lindgren. From 1982 on, all of Askildsen's published books have been short story collections. It is mainly these books that made him one of the most acclaimed modern writers in Norway. Thomas F's siste nedtegnelser til almenheten (1983) won him the Norwegian Critics Prize for Literature. In 2006, a jury appointed by the newspaper Dagbladet voted that collection the best prose book written in Norway during the last 25 years .

Partially complete as of 2018, the trail is ultimately planned to run about from the river's headwaters in Schuylkill County to Fort Mifflin in Philadelphia. Completed portions of the trail include a section from Auburn to Hamburg, a portion from Reading to Pottstown, and a portion from Oaks to South Street in Center City, Philadelphia. Large stretches of the trail are rail trails. Parts of it belong to the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000-mile trail system connecting Maine to Florida. thumbMap of existing and proposed portions of trail on map of proposed regional trail system On many maps and street atlases, and on some of the trail's signage, the segment between Philadelphia and Valley Forge is still identified by the older name Philadelphia‚ÄìValley Forge Trail. Trail description=Auburn to Pottstown Schuylkill River Trail at the Pottstown Riverfront Park The Schuylkill River Trail begins at a trailhead at the Kernsville Dam in Auburn just above Hamburg. The trail runs through Reading to Pottstown until it reaches the Riverfront Park on College Drive near the Reading Railroad Pottstown Station. This section passes through the Schuylkill River National and State Heritage Area, an area generally known for recreational fishing. In lower Berks County, the trail follows the existing Thun Trail, named for industrialist Ferdinand Thun, who founded the Textile Machine Works in Reading in 1892 (later moved to the borough of Wyomissing, a suburb of Reading, in 1896). Plans are underway for a connection from Reading, north to Hamburg. The current northern edge links the trail with the Union Canal towpath. The trail begins in North Reading, along Riverview Drive, then quickly crosses an old railroad bridge into West Reading. It then continues as a mixed-surface path of macadam, gravel, coarse stone, and chalk to Gibraltar where it becomes a poorly marked on-road bicycle route following Old River Road and Schuylkill Road to Birdsboro. From there, the trail follows the old concrete industrial collector, Armorcrast Road, to the rear entrance of a ballfield. The trail then goes off-road as a gravel path to the county line where it meets the paved Schuylkill River Trail, which currently terminates in Pottstown. Pottstown to Phoenixville / Mont Clare Trail at mile 23 marker Two routes have been proposed for this stretch. One would come down the right bank (Chester County side) and end near Cromby Generating Station, above Phoenixville, then use borough streets and the Mont Clare Bridge (PA29) to connect with the trail section along the Canal in Mont Clare. The other plan would bring the trail down the left bank to Mont Clare. It appears that both options may eventually be built, with the Chester County trail proceeding first and carrying the main SRT designation. In April 2011, the Spring City- to-Cromby segment opened on the Chester County side. This segment includes a new trailhead on Township Line Road, near the Cromby Power Plant. Until 2020, there was a disconnect in the official SRT between Phoenixville and Mont Clare, although foot and bicycle traffic easily used the Mont Clare Bridge sidewalk to connect. In 2019-2020 the sidewalk was replaced with a 10 foot wide, barrier protected trail segment, officially closing the gap. Mont Clare to Oaks The trail in Montgomery County next to U.S. Route 422 The stretch of trail from Mont Clare to the Perkiomen Creek near Oaks opened in the spring of 2008. In the first phase of construction the southern section of the trail between Longford Road at the present watered end of the Oakes Reach of the Schuylkill Canal and the Oaks intersection with the Perkiomen Trail was constructed. This section follows much of the filled portion of the Oakes Reach and is paved except for a gravel segment of about half a mile (which also includes a short trail detour). To cross the three streams in this section, two new culverts were constructed and the trail temporarily routed over a historical aqueduct from the Canal at Crossman's Run. A new bridge was built across Crossman's Run for the trail and the paving was completed. The historic Schuylkill Canal aqueduct carries the trail over Crossman's Run near Oaks For phase 1, the northern section, upstream of Longford Road, is signed along the low volume Port Providence Road and Walnut Street, which run along the left bank of the Canal, to reach Mont Clare. In a second phase of construction for the northern segment, the Canal towpath on the canal right bank will be refurbished, and a small bridge constructed over a spillway near Port Providence. On February 14, 2008, a meeting was held to announce the survey work for the Phase 2 extension. This would provide an off-road alternative between Longford Road and Mont Clare. It was expected that the towpath restoration itself would commence in the fall of 2010, but Montgomery County put the project on hold due to budget constraints. In early 2013, construction was started on the towpath portion of the trail with improvements to the Route 29 underpass and construction of a new spillway and foot bridge opposite Port Providence. Oaks to Philadelphia The trail through downtown Conshohocken The next segment of the trail begins in Oaks at the southern end of the Perkiomen Trail and a trailhead at Pawlings Road. This paved segment runs along the abandoned trackbed of the former Schuylkill Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It runs beside U.S. Route 422 for a short distance, then runs through Valley Forge National Historical Park. After leaving the park at Betzwood, it continues along the river to Norristown, where it crosses over U.S. Route 202 and runs through the middle of the Norristown Transportation Center. The trail continues eastwards, now parallel to the SEPTA Manayunk/Norristown rail line. On entering Conshohocken, it passes through industrial areas, under Interstate 476, and intersects the local Cross County Trail. Philadelphia The Schuylkill River Trail in Schuylkill Banks park, Philadelphia Shortly after crossing into Philadelphia, trail traffic is briefly directed onto Nixon and Shawmont Streets, crossing the SEPTA Manayunk/Norristown Line's tracks at the decommissioned Shawmont station. The trail continues southeastward, unpaved, along the former Manayunk Canal Towpath of the Schuylkill Navigation System, passing through the neighborhood of Manayunk to the end of the towpath at Lock Street. Trail traffic is then directed onto the street or sidewalks of Main Street and Ridge Avenue toward Fairmount Park, where the trail meets the southern end of the Wissahickon Trail. Trail traffic continues on the road or sidewalk over the historic Ridge Avenue Bridge (NRHP) crossing the Wissahickon Creek, and turning right onto the paved multi-use trail beside Kelly Drive through east Fairmount Park. The boardwalk over the river in Schuylkill Banks park The trail then winds along the east bank of the Schuylkill River through the park, first passing by the Falls Bridge, then passing under many railroad and highway bridges, past several monuments and Laurel Hill Cemetery. It runs beside Boathouse Row and the Azalea Garden behind the Philadelphia Museum of Art and next to the Fairmount Water Works. After passing under the Spring Garden Street Bridge and West River Drive Bridge, the trail runs along the riverbank on the west edge of Center City, Philadelphia as a waterfront park named Schuylkill Banks. At Locust Street the trail splits with a bridge carrying the trail over CSX-owned railroad tracks to terminate in Schuylkill River Park, while a boardwalk opened in 2014 extends over the river and continues to South Street, ending at the south side of the South Street Bridge. The bridge deck is reached by a ramp to the north side of the bridge or by a staircase with a bike trough up to the south side of the bridge. On May 20, 2009, as one of its last acts, the Fairmount Park Commission approved the acquisition of of land along the Schuylkill River to extend the river trail. From South Street to Christian Street, the trail continues over land owned by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, which announced plans to host the trail in 2013 and opened the section on April 20, 2018. The next extension of the river trail includes a proposed cable-stayed bridge to connect Christian Street to the existing trail in Grays Ferry Crescent, a park along the Grays Ferry river bend. This trail section received $12,000,000 from the U.S. Department of Transportation in March 2018. Construction on this trail portion is scheduled to begin in 2020. A related project involves the conversion of an abandoned railway swing bridge to a pedestrian and cyclist swing bridge connecting Grays Ferry Crescent to Bartram's Mile‚Äîa park on the west side of the Schuylkill River, north of Bartram's Garden. The bridge is under construction south of the Grays Ferry Bridge, with funding from the city, state, and a Federal Highway Administration program. Completion of the bridge conversion is expected by mid-2020. History Schuylkill River Trail eastbound at Spring Mill Many current and proposed sections of the Schuylkill River Trail, including the Thun Trail and the Oaks to Philadelphia portion, are rail trails, following the right-of-way of the former Schuylkill Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Live catenary wires are still in place above the trail between Norristown and Philadelphia. These are part of Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system, and supply power for both the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line and Northeast Corridor. The Shawmont to Manayunk portion of the trail runs along the towpath of the historic Schuylkill Canal (Schuylkill Navigation System).

Saratoga Casino Hotel is home to a -mile standardbred race track, with a racino and hotel located inside the racetrack's grandstand. Saratoga Casino Hotel is not to be confused with the historic Saratoga Race Course thoroughbred race track located across the street on Nelson Avenue. Facility Saratoga Casino Hotel has three entrances: A primary entrance on Jefferson Street, where the Saratoga Harness Hall of Fame is located, a secondary entrance on Crescent Avenue, and a third entrance on Nelson Avenue, just north of its intersection with Crescent Avenue. The facility is located on the southeastern tip of Saratoga Springs. First opened in 1941 as a harness racing track, the facility was expanded in 2004 to include video lottery gaming terminals, or VLT as they are officially called. Then in 2016, a hotel was constructed on the north end of the property where a training track once existed. The track is a -mile oval, where horses do two laps to complete the commonly used distance used in U.S. standardbred races. Because of the landscaping present in the infield and the country feel, the track has been dubbed \\"The most beautiful -mile track in the country. For some time, an expansion of the track to a -mile oval was being discussed, but it never came into fruition, and no further discussion about an expansion to the track's oval has come up in the last 10 years. Inside, the first floor grandstand has been converted into the casino, with over 1,700 video lottery terminals, or VLT's for short. While the majority of these are slots, there are some poker, roulette, blackjack and keno games present, all in video format. There is a Diamond Jim's bar and two eateries, one a regular fare menu called Lucky Joe's, and the other a buffet restaurant called Garden Buffet. And there's a nightclub called Vapor's, home to live music, DJ remixes and other special events throughout the year. The second floor was renovated prior to the VLT inclusion, but hosts simulcast and live wagering as well as stands for fans to sit and watch the races, and Fortune's Restaurant, a sit-down casual dining facility serves meals during the racing season, typically between March‚ÄìDecember. Attached to the Grandstand is the Clubhouse, essentially unchanged over the past 15 years that the facility has undergone massive changes. Open only during live racing, the clubhouse houses one bar and a quick food eatery for patrons watching the races, in addition to the accustomed wagering terminals. Except for the craps and roulette, where the results are random and not based on previous outcomes, the slot machines are such where each play is dependent on the results of lottery scratch play ticket pre-determined by the centralized computer system‚Äîwhich in this case is the New York Lottery. All machines work on a voucher system, where the patron inserts money or a ticket, and all payouts are given in the form of a printed voucher, which may be inserted into another machine or turned into the cashier cage for payment. History Saratoga Casino Hotel has changed names over the past 20 years with the various changes to the facility. The track, originally dubbed Saratoga Raceway, was opened in 1941 as a facility for American harness racing and was the third racetrack to have pari-mutuel wagering. According to the history books, the Saratoga harness racing legend was born when two horses named Lady Suffolk (aka The Old Gray Mare) and Moscow were set against each other in a staged race in the city of Saratoga Springs. During the height of racing, thousands of fans would visit to cheer on the horses. The track would offer grand-circuit racing, attracting some of the biggest names of racing at that day to the half-mile facility. The track was notorious in the early 1980s for being where Niatross collapsed and fell on the inner rail on the stretch run home, dealing him his first ever career loss. But the advent of off-track betting and the economy led towards sour times for racing at the Raceway. Not wanting to surrender, the management changed the name of Saratoga Raceway to Saratoga Equine Sports Center in the 1990s, to reflect the plans of bringing in more horse-related activities to the facility. But renewed interest didn't formulate with the name change, and at the worst, track management had to import races from other tracks across New York State in order to offer fill up a nine-race card. The change for Saratoga Raceway came in 2001 when government officials in New York State approved a bill allowing VLT's to installed at race tracks across the state, pending approval from the local governments which the track resided in. In early 2002, Saratoga County officials approved the installation of the terminals at Saratoga Raceway, which began construction in 2003 with work being done to the ground floor of the grandstand to transform it from a racing facility to the modern day gaming floor. On January 28, 2004, Saratoga Raceway became the first racing facility in New York to open the video lottery games to the public, as thousands of patrons came to usher in the new era at the Raceway. In reflection of the new video lottery games, the Saratoga Equine Sports Center changed its name in 2004 to Saratoga Gaming and Raceway, which would last until the start of 2011, when the facility changed names once more to Saratoga Casino and Raceway, reflecting the plans to introduce electronic table games to the facility and increase the diversity of gaming options at the racino. The effects of the racino could immediately be found at the racing side of the facility. Purses started to increase dramatically. Prior to the VLTs, horses running in the highest level, the \\"Winners over $5,000 Lifetime\\" condition, was competing for approximately $4,500 in purse money. Today, horses running in the highest level, the \\"Open Handicap\\", now compete for approximately $16,000 in purse money. Horses who ran for the lowest class offered, a $2,500 claim, ran for $1,100 in purse money. Today, the lowest condition is offered for $3,200. The racino measure also allowed Saratoga Casino and Raceway to offer the New York Sire Stakes Night of Champions in 2005 and 2006 while Yonkers Raceway was being renovated to allow for video slots. The two nights gave Saratoga Casino & Raceway the highest single-day purse offerings, with over $1 million up for grabs. The New York Sire Stakes Night of Champions returned to the racino for a third time on October 1, 2011. Saratoga Casino and Raceway's biggest race of the year is the Joe Gerrity Jr. Pacing Series, which takes place in August. It was a four-leg series until 2013, when management opted to make the race a single \\"Free For All\\" pace worth $275,000. The race has brought big-name standardbreds to Saratoga, and has resulted in the fastest times the track has ever seen be recorded, like in 2014 when Dancin Yankee stopped the timer in 1:48:4, a track record that still stands two years later. In May 2012, the track's parent company, Saratoga Harness Racing, agreed to buy Fitzgeralds Casino in Black Hawk, Colorado for $28 million. The sale closed in January 2013, with plans to spend $40 million on expansion and rename the property as Saratoga Casino Black Hawk. The company also acquired a minority stake in Ellis Park Race Course in Kentucky in 2012, and then acquired full ownership of the track in 2018. In 2015, construction of a brand new hotel began on the facility's north side, where a training track once resided. The hotel opened in July 2016, bringing the management to change the name to the current name of Saratoga Casino Hotel. Starting in February of 2019, Saratoga Casino began an $8 Million upgrade to include new features and amenities such as an Outdoor Gaming Terrace, a Sports Bar, and a VIP Lounge.

Saratoga has named a Stakes series for younger trotters in Story's honor. Amenities The property has 1,700 video lottery games as well as live harness racing during the months of March to December, simulcast at the horse racing center on the mezzanine level. There are multiple food facilities: an atrium-style food court, a snack and hot dog counter in the Lower Clubhouse (open during live racing only), The Garden Buffet, a track-side restaurant \\"Fortunes\\", and Jackpot's Deli Counter. There are also 3 bars, and live entertainment at Vapor Night Club including live bands, DJs and national acts. The casino was also known in Saratoga Springs for its Independence Day fireworks display held annually on July 3. The yearly tradition was discontinued in 2014 when management decided to join forces with the City of Saratoga Springs for their July 4 fireworks extravaganza at nearby Congress Park.

It corresponds, a little later, to hypermodern play in chess, with the inversion that shinfuseki thought the center of the board had been unjustly underemphasised. In the 1930s, a group of Japanese players led by Kitani Minoru and Go Seigen began to question conventional wisdom on Go openings. Playing for early central influence, they emphasised in the early part of the opening fighting concepts such as thickness and moyo. Among the new concepts of shinfuseki was playing the first move on the center point. Traditional opening play followed a basic principle of sound play that can be summarized in three words -- \\"corner, side, center.\\" Territory is easiest to surround in the corner, because two sides are bounded by the edge of the board; on the side, one edge is available, but in center the territory must be completely surrounded on four sides. Shinfuseki thinking saw this approach as too narrow. For three or four years radical innovation was tried. Subsequent opening theory has partly accepted these ideas, and dropped others. Contemporary players such as Takemiya Masaki and Yamashita Keigo have added their own personal innovations to the stock of opening ideas rooted in shinfuseki. In 1999, Go Seigen commented that \\"The 'new opening' period was only a step on the way to the perfecting of go... As I have already said, go should be played over the whole board. In that respect Shin Fuseki was an ideal style to stimulate the creativity of players beyond fixed josekis (corner patterns) and to broaden understanding of the game.\\" Example of shinfuseki One of the most famous games of the 20th century was played in 1933 between Honinb≈ç Sh≈´sai, head of the traditional Honinb≈ç school and holder of the highest title in the Go world, and Go Seigen, representative of the new wave. Honinb≈ç Sh≈´sai (White) vs. Go Seigen (Black) Black began the game by boldly occupying the 3-3 point in the upper right, the 4-4 point in the lower left, and the center point. White countered by occupying the corners in the upper left and lower right. With move 21, Black completed a sphere of influence in the center. By the late middle game Black had built up a promising position, but White's move 160 was a brilliant move in the center that put White back in the game and eventually led to the capture of five Black stones on the right. White won the game by two points.

The gardens had previously been a private space for the use of the freeholders or lease-holders of the surrounding buildings, who objected to their compulsory purchase, fearing that their use by the public would create a nuisance which would lower the value of their property.

History Prior to 2010, Boston Review appeared in tabloid format. Above is the March/April 2009 issue cover. Boston Review was founded as New Boston Review in 1975. A quarterly devoted to literature and the arts, the magazine was started by a group that included Juan Alonso, Richard Burgin, and Anita Silvey. In 1976, after the departure of some of the founding editors, the publication was co-edited by Juan Alonso and Gail Pool, and then by Gail Pool and Lorna Condon. In the late seventies, it switched from quarterly to bimonthly publication. In 1980, Arthur Rosenthal became publisher of the magazine, which was renamed Boston Review and edited by Nick Bromell. Succeeding editors were Mark Silk and then Margaret Ann Roth, who remained until 1991. During the eighties, the focus of the magazine broadened and during the nineties became more politically oriented, while maintaining a strong profile in both fiction and poetry.https://bostonreview.net/about Joshua Cohen replaced Roth in 1991, and has been editor since then. The full text of Boston Review has been available online since 1995. Since 1996, thirty books have been published based on articles and forums that originally appeared in the Boston Review. Since 2006, MIT Press has been publishing a \\"Boston Review Books\\" series. Deborah Chasman joined the magazine as co-editor in 2001. Pulitzer-prize winner Junot D√≠az is the current fiction editor; Timothy Donnelly, B. K. Fischer, and Stefania Heim are the poetry editors. In 2010, Boston Review switched from black and white tabloid to an glossy, all- color format. The same year, it was the recipient of Utne Reader magazine's Utne Independent Press Award for Best Writing. The magazine switched print formats again in 2017, merging its bimonthly general interest magazine and book publications into quarterly, themed bookazines.https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry- news/publisher-news/article/72719-the-boston-review-launches-bookazine- program.html Features=New Democracy Forum The New Democracy Forum is a special feature of the Boston Review. It offers an arena for fostering and exploring issues regarding politics and policy. A typical forum includes a lead article by an expert and contributions from other respondents. Past forums have covered topics such as making foreign aid work, a strategy to disengage from Iraq, and new economic stress in the middle class. New Fiction Forum The New Fiction Forum was created as \\"a space for wide- ranging dialogue about contemporary fiction, a dialogue founded on a simple premise: that despite the intense commercialism of current publishing, there are original, vital novels published every season and readers to whom such narratives are of the profoundest importance\\". Past forums include fiction and reviews by Jhumpa Lahiri and Emily Barton.

He batted and threw right-handed.  Early baseball career  After playing for Marshall University, Reed was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 26th round of the 1986 Major League Baseball Draft. He made his major league debut for Pittsburgh in 1988, but saw only limited playing time each year through 1991. After 1991, he spent several more years mostly in the minors. A highlight of Reed's early baseball career came on June 13, 1990 when Reed picked up the only save of his major league career in a 6-5 Pirates victory over the Cardinals. https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN199006130.shtml Replacement baseball In 1995, which was Reed's 10th year of pro ball, he agreed to be a replacement player for the Cincinnati Reds during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike.List of Major League Baseball replacement players Reed had been scheduled to be the Reds' opening day starter in 1995 if the strike hadn't been settled. He told reporters in 1995 that he sat in his hotel room the weekend before the scheduled start and prayed the strike would end so he wouldn't have to take the mound. \\"It was their season to start, not mine,\\" Reed said of the regular players. After the strike After the strike, Reed was pitching well in the minor leagues with an 8-4 record and a 3.17 earned- run average. On July 21, 1995, Reed was recalled by Cincinnati to the consternation of several of his teammates who had gone on strike. In Reed's first major league start in 1995, he pitched 6-1/3 innings of no-hit baseball during a home game against the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs' Mark Grace broke up the no-hitter with an infield single off the glove of shortstop and future Hall of Famer Barry Larkin with one out in the seventh inning. During the rest of the 1995 season in the majors, Reed did not pitch well. He was optioned back to Triple-A Indianapolis on August 14, 1995. On October 16, 1995, Reed filed for free agency. On November 7, 1995, Reed was signed by the New York Mets system. Reed spent the 1996 season in the minors, pitching in the New York Mets' system for the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. Return to the majors, and success In 1997, Reed found his major league stride with the New York Mets, going 13‚Äì9 and finishing sixth in the National League with a 2.89 ERA. His most productive season came in 1998, when he won 16 games and held a 3.48 ERA, striking out 153 batters while walking just 29. An All-Star in 1998 and 2001, he also was a member of the Mets team that faced the New York Yankees in the Subway Series. Reed was traded by the Mets to the Minnesota Twins for outfielder Matt Lawton midseason in 2001. He won 15 games for Minnesota in 2002 and led the American League in walks per nine innings. After a disappointing 2003 season where he went 6‚Äì12 with a 5.07 ERA, Reed retired. In a 15-season career, Reed posted a 93‚Äì76 record with 970 strikeouts and a 4.03 ERA.  After the majors  In 2005, Reed returned to Marshall University as the pitching coach for the Thundering Herd baseball team.

It is the soundtrack for the 1981 American neo-noir crime film Thief, directed by Michael Mann. It reached No. 43 on the UK Albums Chart in a 3-week run. \\"Beach Theme\\" and \\"Beach Scene\\" are two different mixes of the same piece. The album version of \\"Dr. Destructo\\" is quite different from the film version. An extended version of \\"Dr. Destructo\\" was available only on a promo single. \\"Igneous\\" is a remix of \\"Thru Metamorphic Rocks\\" from the 1979 album Force Majeure. Neither \\"Beach Theme\\" nor \\"Trap Feeling\\" appear in the film. After Tangerine Dream completed the soundtrack, Mann needed another sequence. As Tangerine Dream was on tour, Craig Safan composed and performed \\"Confrontation\\". The original 1981 Elektra LP released in the U.S. featured \\"Confrontation\\", but subsequent releases featured \\"Beach Scene\\" instead. During the 1980s, Toronto television station CITY-DT used \\"Scrap Yard\\" as their background music when inserting technical difficulties slide cards. Scrap Yard was also used as theme for local television newscasts on KFTY (now KEMO-TV) in Santa Rosa, California and WNDU in South Bend, Indiana. The soundtrack was also nominated for Worst Musical Score at the 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards. Versions There are currently two versions of the soundtrack available with different track listings and album covers. Version A has the text 'Original Motion Picture Soundtrack' above the title followed by the text 'James Caan' just below. The text 'Composed and Performed by Tangerine Dream', appears at the bottom. Version B just has \\"Tangerine Dream\\" above the title. In 2004, Wounded Bird Records re-released version B with \\"Confrontation\\"; there were however two mispressings, one with the version A track list, and one with \\"Igneous\\" removed instead of \\"Beach Scene\\". All had the listing for version B on the CD and cover. In 2014, Perseverance Records released a re-mastered, nine track version that included both \\"Beach Scene\\" and \\"Confrontation\\", thus correcting the errors on previous releases where both tracks were never on the same disc.

A 1981 study by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP), requested by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' SubCommittee On Construction (AASHTO SCOC), prompted the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) to merge two certification bodies; the Institute for the Certification of Engineering Technicians (ICET) and the Engineering Technologist Certification Institute. The result is a nonprofit organization that provides a nationally recognized and accepted procedure for recognition of qualified engineering technicians and technologists. NICET is a not for profit division of the NSPE. The NICET registration process is separated into two class distinctions with subcategories and several specialized areas of focus. The titles of the \\"Certified Engineering Technician\\" and \\"Certified Engineering Technologist\\" are the primary designations. The subcategories are further specialized by focus. The titles chosen for these subcategories are known as Civil Engineering or Electrical/Mechanical Systems. Within the subcategories the disciplines are refined to address a selected area of expertise and are limited by categories that do not cover all areas of Technology. The purpose of certification programs NICET's nationally recognized certification programs lay out a path for career advancement from entry to senior level responsibilities. Designed by industry experts to provide engineering technology fields with a qualified workforce, programs are used by employers and specifiers to measure job skills and knowledge. Technician certification Technician certification requires testing (written, multiple choice) and documentation including a work history, recommendations, and, for most programs, supervisor verification of specific experience. Technologist certification Technologist certification requires a 4-year engineering technology degree (no testing required), and at the advanced level, documentation including a work history and endorsements. Training certificates NICET's professional certification is based on testing that covers a broad range of job knowledge, verification of job performance, and an evaluation of work experience. NICET certification represents a career level (i.e., not a course outcome). NICET's certification cannot be gained by attendance only. Credibility There are competing ideologies from societies with different perspectives on what represents the qualities of a Technologist. The Society of Broadcast Engineers (SBE) has a different technologist certification criteria than either NICET or the National Association of Industrial Technologist. The Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) has a different approach from the other certification bodies for Technologist. It is therefore appropriate to determine that a unified definition for certification is not apparent. The Technologist title from NICET does not require an examination for registration at the Technologist level. However, individuals sit for examination at the Technician levels. The Technologist registration requires that an individual will have graduated from a university that is ABET/TAC accredited and provide evidence of appropriate experience. The Technologist Certification level is not achievable by non-ABET graduates. Open knowledge based testing for graduates of applied science programs and non-ABET accredited education is currently not allowed. The NICET Engineering Technologist Certification is therefore a limited access membership. Exclusions NICET excludes Technologist registration for individuals who have graduated from applied science programs or those who obtained valid education from non-ABET/TAC universities recognized by CHEA or the US Department of Education. Open registration concepts that may rely on examinations and/or experiential qualifications would improve the acceptance of the NICET certifications. Some program accreditations that are excluded from the NICET program are the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC), the National Association of Industrial Technology (NAIT), the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology (ACCSCT), or other non-ABET/TAC institutions that are exclusively regionally accredited such as the Thomas Edison Engineering Technology program, but they do accept ABET/TAC accredited programs from that University such as Electronic Systems Engineering Technology. Job placement A Technologist curriculum may focus on specialized issues such as technical management, service, processes, or production improvements. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) acknowledges the different accreditations in technology and engineering as independent career paths which cannot be compared. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics had the following to say about technologist. :‚ÄúMany 4-year colleges offer bachelor‚Äôs degrees in engineering technology, but graduates of these programs often are hired to work as technologists or applied engineers, not technicians.\\" (BLS,2006) Use of NICET certification varies according to needs determined by employers, specifiers, and local government. Specific certification requirements established throughout the United States vary by engineering technology fields in various states and localities. Some areas may require a NICET or similar certification as condition for employment. Often an engineering technology degree is used in lieu of a technician certification in areas where they deem a four year engineering technology degree to have more value than a technician certification earned through work history and testing requirements. Unlike Professional Engineers who are licensed by the States, Technologists are not protected or licensed by States. A government sponsored registration is opposed by the NCEES and NSPE.

The route was to be a four- lane divided highway from Route 18 in East Brunswick eastward to an interchange with Route 35 in the Laurence Harbor section of Old Bridge Township. The freeway would have provided a much needed east-west connection between U.S. Route 9 and Route 18. Tentatively named the \\"Industrial Freeway\\", Route 74 was to be a long four-lane freeway, with eight exits. Also included in the proposal was a U.S. Route 9 expressway to Route 35 in South Amboy and a connector spur from Route 74 back to Route 35 near Morgan. Plans for the Route 74 \\"Industrial\\" Freeway date back to 1956, when local officials brought up the original plan to the state level. The state legislated the designation in January 1962, and studies for construction began four years later. Although the construction of the freeway seemed imminent, a transportation bond issue in 1972 killed the construction. Although a local agency gave Route 74 one last shot in 1975, the plans for a freeway were shelved. Despite that, the New Jersey Department of Transportation and New Jersey State Legislature haven't officially taken it off their \\"Route Log\\" in the statutes. Route 74, along with New Jersey Route 60 and New Jersey Route 85, are the only remaining unbuilt freeways left on the official NJDOT \\"Route Log\\".  History  The interchange between Route 18 and CR 535, the approximate area where Route 74 would have begun The original proposals for the Industrial Highway in Middlesex and Monmouth Counties date back to 1956, when officials from both counties brought forth a plan for a new industrial highway from Route 18 in East Brunswick eastward to Route 35 in Matawan. The proposal was then submitted by local authorities to then-state senator John Lynch. The proposal was turned into a bill and turned over the New Jersey State Legislature, who passed it in January 1962. From studies performed by Parsons Brinckerhoff in 1966 and 1967, the Route 74 Freeway was to serve the need for an east-west expressway on the area south of the Raritan River. The area covered in the studies showed that by 1985, the amount of parkland, industry and community size would grow by 150%. The existing east-west two-lane roadways would then be unable to carry the amount of projected traffic daily. In order to protect Cheesequake State Park and lessen the interference of private industrial land, the state chose the preferred alignment. This alignment would end up seizing 19 residential homes and 19 commercial businesses to build the new freeway. Along with the right-of-way exception and construction costs, the estimated cost for building the Route 74 Freeway would be about $64.7 million (1970 USD). Although the freeway in plans were supposed to cross the Garden State Parkway around milepost 119, there were no set plans for an interchange between the two highways. However, the studies from Parsons Brinckerhoff did put forth that this could be possible in the future. Also, the new freeway did not serve access to the New Jersey Turnpike, the route was to begin just a mile south of Route 18's interchange. Bundled up with Route 74 were two other expressways, the construction of a new expressway on U.S. Route 9 itself, and a spur route off of Route 74 further east. The connecting freeway were later added to the state legislation in 1971. However, when the state transportation bond proposed by the Legislature in 1972 failed, the construction of the Route 74 Freeway seemed inevitable. In 1975, the Tri-State Transportation Commission gave the pitch of attempting Route 74 one last time, citing that it would \\"help serve planned industrial and residential concentrations\\". The Commission's report cited that the route is started soon, could be constructed by 2000. However, by the early 1980s, the commission had dropped the route from their focus, and despite no route ever being constructed, Route 74, along with Route 60 and Route 85, remain in the state's unofficial Route Log in the state statutes.  Proposed route  Route 74 was to begin at an interchange with Route 18 in the community of East Brunswick (in Middlesex County). The route was to head eastward, crossing over CR 527 (the Old Bridge Turnpike) just after its impetus. From there, the four-lane freeway was to enter the community of South River, where it would have an interchange with CR 535 (Main Street). The route would dip to the south, cross over the South River and into Sayreville. There it would parallel CR 535 (now known as Washington Road), and interchange with CR 675 (Jernee's Mill Road) in the community. After an interchange with Minisink Avenue, Route 74 was to turn to the southeast and head out of Sayreville. Starting here, the area surrounding the freeway was to be improvised with major development. The route was to continue to the southeast, approaching an interchange with CR 615 (Bordentown-South Amboy Turnpike). At that interchange, Route 74 was to turn eastward again, reaching an interchange with the proposed US 9 expressway. Also to be present at this interchange was the northern terminus of Route 34 in Browntown. After crossing US 9 and Route 34, Route 74 was to continue eastward into more rural portions of Middlesex County, interchanging with a spur which would head northward to Route 35 in South Amboy. Route 74 would parallel to the north of Route 34 past the community of Cheesequake, crossing the southern line of Cheesequake State Park. The route would then cross into a small portion of the state park when it turned to the northeast, interchanging with CR 689 (Morristown Road) in Cheesequake. After leaving the park, Route 74 was to continue northeastward, running along the Middlesex-Monmouth county line. A short distance later, it would cross over Milepost 119 of the Garden State Parkway, with no interchange. Paralleling the Lawrence Parkway to the west, Route 74 turned northward, interchanging and coming to an end at Route 35 in Laurence Harbor, just north of the county line.  Proposed exit list  The entire route was to be in Middlesex County.

It occurs off southern Africa, typically offshore at a depth of , and off southern Australia and New Zealand, from the intertidal zone to a depth of . It is mostly bottom-dwelling in nature and can be found across a range of habitats from estuaries to reefs, but also frequently will swim into open water. The largest stingray in the world, this heavy-bodied species can grow upwards of across and in weight. Its plain-colored, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc is characterized by a lack of dermal denticles even in adults, and white pores beside the head on either side. The body can have colors as well as dark grey or black with rows of white spots along each wing. Its tail is usually shorter than the disc and thick at the base. It is armed with large tubercles and a midline row of large thorns in front of the stinging spine which has the dorsal and ventral fin folds behind.Dianne J. Bray, 2011, Smooth Stingray, Dasyatis brevicaudata, in Fishes of Australia, accessed 26 Aug 2014, http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/2020 The diet of the short- tail stingray consists of invertebrates and bony fishes, including burrowing and midwater species. It tends to remain within a relatively limited area throughout the year, preferring deeper waters during the winter, and is not known to perform long migrations. Large aggregations of rays form seasonally at certain locations, such as in the summer at the Poor Knight Islands off New Zealand. Both birthing and mating have been documented within the aggregations at Poor Knights. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") produced by the mother; the litter size is six to 10. But it is not unheard of for the stingray to give birth to a litter of 15. The short-tail stingray is not aggressive, but is capable of inflicting a lethal wound with its long, venomous sting. It is often caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range, usually surviving to be released. Because its population does not appear threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists it under least concern.  Taxonomy  The original description of the short-tail stingray was made by Frederick Hutton, curator of the Otago Museum, from a female specimen across caught off Dunedin in New Zealand. He published his account in an 1875 issue of the scientific journal Annals and Magazine of Natural History, in which he named the new species Trygon brevicaudata, derived from the Latin brevis (\\"short\\") and cauda (\\"tail\\"). Although long assigned to Dasyatis, recent work by Last et al. (2016) resurrected Bathytoshia for it and the broad stingray, as well as the roughtail stingray.Last, P.R., G.J. P. Naylor and B.M. Manjaji-Matsumoto, 2016. A revised classification of the family Dasyatidae (Chondrichthyes: Myliobatiformes) based on new morphological and molecular insights. Zootaxa 4139 (no. 3): 345‚Äì368. The short-tail stingray may also be referred to as giant black ray, giant stingray, New Zealand short-tail stingaree, Schreiners ray, short-tailed stingaree, shorttail black stingray, and smooth short-tailed stingray. It is closely related to the similar-looking but smaller pitted stingray (Dasyatis matsubarai) of the northwestern Pacific.  Description  As its name suggests, tail length is an identifying trait of the short-tail stingray. Heavily built and characteristically smooth, the pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray had a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading margins of the disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them was a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and five to seven papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. About 45‚Äì55 tooth rows are in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips. The tail is usually shorter than the disc and has one, sometimes two, serrated stinging spines on the upper surface, about halfway along its length. It is broad and flattened until the base of the sting; after, it tapers rapidly and a prominent ventral fin fold runs almost to the sting tip, as well as a low dorsal ridge. Dermal denticles are only found on the tail, with at least one thorn appearing on the tail base by a disc width of . Adults have a midline row of large, backward- pointing, spear-like thorns or flattened tubercles in front of the sting, as well as much smaller, conical thorns behind the sting covering the tail to the tip. The dorsal coloration is grayish brown, darkening towards the tip of the tail and above the eyes, with a line of white pores flanking the head on either side. The underside is whitish, darkening towards the fin margins and beneath the tail. Albino individuals have been reported. The short-tail stingray is the largest stingray species, known to reach at least in width, in length, and in weight. Reliable observers off New Zealand have reported sighting individuals almost across. Mature females are about a third larger than mature males.  Distribution and habitat  Off Australia and New Zealand, the short-tail stingray was common in shallow coastal waters. The short-tail stingray is common and widely distributed in the temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere. Off southern Africa, it has been reported from Cape Town in South Africa to the mouth of the Zambezi River in Mozambique. Along the southern Australian coast, it is found from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Maroochydore in Queensland, including Tasmania. In New Zealand waters, it occurs off North Island and the Chatham Islands, and rarely off South Island and the Kermadec Islands. Records from northern Australia and Thailand likely represent misidentifications of pink whipray and pitted stingray, respectively. Over the past few decades, its range and numbers off southeastern Tasmania have grown, possibly as a result of climate change. Off southern Africa, the short-tail stingray is rare in shallow water and is most often found over offshore banks at a depth of . However, off Australia and New Zealand, it was found from the intertidal zone to no deeper than . Australian and New Zealand rays were most abundant in the shallows during the summer. A tracking study conducted on two New Zealand rays suggests that they shifted to deeper waters during the winter, but did not undertake long-distance migrations. The short-tail stingray is mainly bottom-dwelling in nature, inhabiting a variety of environments including brackish estuaries, sheltered bays and inlets, sandy flats, rocky reefs, and the outer continental shelf. However, it also makes regular forays upward into the middle of the water column.  Biology and ecology  The short-tail stingray mainly forages for food on or near the bottom. The short-tail stingray is usually slow-moving, but can achieve sudden bursts of speed, flapping its pectoral fins with enough force to cavitate the water and create an audible \\"bang\\". Cavitation is when a liquid is pushed faster that it can react, causing a drop in pressure. It is known to form large seasonal aggregations; a well-known example occurs every summer (January to April) at the Poor Knights Islands off New Zealand, particularly under the rocky archways. In some areas, it moves with the rising tide into very shallow water. Individual rays tend to stay inside a relatively small home range with a radius of under . Captive experiments have shown it capable of detecting magnetic fields via its electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini, which in nature may be employed for navigation. The short-tail stingray forages for food both during the day and at night. It feeds primarily on benthic bony fishes and invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. The lateral line system on its underside allows it to detect the minute water jets produced by buried bivalves and spoon worms, which are then extracted by suction; the excess water is expelled through the spiracles. Fishes and invertebrates from open water, including salps and hyperiid amphipods, are also eaten in significant quantities. Off South Africa, this ray has been observed patrolling the egg beds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii) during mass spawnings, capturing squid that descend to the bottom to spawn. The short-tail stingray has few predators due to its size; these included the copper shark, the smooth hammerhead, the great white shark, and the killer whale. When threatened, it raises its tail warningly over its back like a scorpion. Smaller fishes have been observed using swimming rays for cover while hunting their own prey. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti, and the monogeneans Heterocotyle tokoloshei and Dendromonocotyle sp.  Life history  Short-tail stingrays gather every summer off the Poor Knights Islands, New Zealand. The summer aggregations of the short-tail stingray at the Poor Knights Islands seem to at least partly serve a reproductive purpose, as both mating and birthing have been observed among the gathered rays. Courtship and mating takes place in midwater, and the rising current flowing continuously through the narrow archways is thought to aid the rays in maintaining their position. Each receptive female may be followed by several males, which attempt to bite and grip her disc. One or two males may be dragged by the female for hours before she accedes; the successful male flips upside down beneath her, inserting one of his claspers into her vent and rhythmically waving his tail from side to side. Copulation lasted 3‚Äì5 minutes. Females in captivity have been observed mating with up to three different males in succession. Like other stingrays, the short-tail stingray was aplacental viviparous; once the developing embryos exhaust their yolk supply, they are provisioned with histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\", enriched with proteins, lipids, and mucus) produced by the mother and delivered through specialized extensions of the uterine epithelium called \\"trophonemata\\". Females bear litters of six to 10 pups in the summer; males appear to assist in the process by nudging the female's abdomen with their snouts. Females are ready to mate again shortly after giving birth. Newborns measure across.  Human interactions  A short-tail stingray at the Sydney Aquarium Curious and unaggressive, the short-tail stingray may approach humans and can be trained to be hand-fed. At Hamelin Bay in Western Australia, many short-tail stingrays, thorntail stingrays, and New Zealand eagle rays regularly gather to be hand-fed fish scraps; the number of visitors has steadily increased in recent years, and interest exists in developing the site as a permanent tourist attraction. However, if startled or harassed, this species is capable of inflicting a serious, even fatal wound with its sting. The sting can measure over long and can penetrate most types of footwear, including kevlar bootees, and its mucous sheath contains a toxin that causes necrosis. The most dangerous injuries involve damage to a vital organ, massive blood loss, and/or secondary sepsis or tetanus. A startled ray is also able to leap through water, and inflict injuries with its tail. This species is responsible for the majority of stingray injuries off New Zealand; the most infamous incident was the death of Steve Irwin when a stingray pierced his heart with its barbed tail. Throughout its range, the short-tail stingray is caught incidentally by various commercial fisheries using trawls, Danish and purse seines, longlines and set lines, and drag and set nets. It is also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line (from boats or the shore), spears, and harpoons. Most individuals caught are released alive; often, fishers cut off their tails beforehand for safety, though this practice does not seem to have a significant impact on the rays' long-term survival. Sport fishers occasionally keep captured rays for meat or angling competitions; a few are also kept for display in public aquariums, and they reproduce in captivity. As it survives fishing activities well and remained common throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the short-tail stingray as least concern.

She served as a commissioned ship for 27 years and 3 months, the longest time in commission of any AKA. Arneb (AKA-56) was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1159) as Mischief by the Moore Dry Dock Company at Oakland, California, launched on 6 July 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Carol J. Palmer, the daughter of a plant engineer, acquired by the Navy on 16 November and towed to Portland, Oregon, where she was converted to an attack cargo ship by the Willamette Iron and Steel Works, and commissioned on 28 April 1944, Comdr. Howard R. Shaw in command. Service history=World War II, 1944-1945 Outfitted and loaded with stores for her first cruise by 10 May 1944, the attack cargo ship steamed to San Diego for shakedown training which was made unexpectedly interesting by her rescue of the three-man crew of a Navy Grumman TBF Avenger that had had to \\"ditch\\". During June and July, the ship practiced amphibious maneuvers using Army troops to make landings on San Clemente Island. On 22 July, Arneb sailed for the Hawaiian Islands, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 30 July. After debarking passengers, the ship continued on to Guadalcanal for training. On 29 August, the ship got underway with three transport divisions to rehearse landings for the invasion of the Palau Islands. On 8 September, she sortied with Transport Division (TransDiv) 32, and headed for Angaur Island. The cargo ship arrived on 17 September and lowered all of her boats off the west side of the island to feign landings in that quarter in an effort to divert Japanese defensive forces. The next day, she actually landed troops and equipment of the 306th Engineers. Arneb remained in the Palaus. until 23 September, when she began carrying cargo and troops to Ulithi, Hollandia, and the Admiralty Islands. At Manus, she fueled and loaded supplies for training and rehearsal exercises for her next operation, the liberation of the Philippines. She got underway on 12 October, arrived off Leyte on the 20th, and, despite enemy shelling, immediately began discharging, her cargo and troops. Arneb next steamed to Guam to take on more cargo and troops for delivery at Leyte on 23 November and 24 November. Following her second voyage to Leyte, the ship steamed to Hollandia to onload provisions, cargo, and personnel as well as to receive minor repairs. Arneb departed Hollandia on 27 December to participate in the invasion of Luzon, anchoring in Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945. Since she was not carrying high priority cargo, her boats helped transports in landing troops and cargo on D-Day before they began unloading her own cargo on the following day. Although enemy air and small craft activity was intense, Arneb only lost one LCVP. She returned to Leyte on 15 January and ferried troops and supplies to Luzon for the assault on the area around La Paz on the 29th. During the next few weeks, the vessel took on fuel, cargo, and other supplies in Leyte Gulf in preparation for her next major task, the invasion of the Ryukyus. On 27 March, Arneb left Leyte Gulf, arrived off Okinawa on 1 April, and unloaded supplies despite enemy air attacks. She retired to Guam and was ordered to proceed on 10 April via Pearl Harbor to the United States. The ship arrived in San Pedro on 3 May and was given a 15-day availability. Then, after loading ammunition and other supplies, she sailed for Pearl Harbor on 8 June. She returned to the west coast before the end of the month and moved into drydock at the Moore Dry Dock Co. On 20 July, the cargo ship was once again headed for the Hawaiian Islands on the first of two voyages made before the end of August. During the ship's second run to Oahu, Japan capitulated, ending the fighting in the Pacific. While in Pearl Harbor on 28 August, Arneb received orders to load cargo and sail for the China coast to support the occupation forces. She ferried cargo and troops between Okinawa and China until 26 October, when she headed for San Francisco. Diverted to Seattle en route, she arrived there on 13 November 1945. Transport duties and conversion, 1945-1949 The ship was then assigned to the Naval Transport Service and made cargo runs between the west coast and the Far East until December 1947. Placed in reserve at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 16 March 1948, Arneb was modified to prepare her for polar operations. Equipped to become Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd's flagship for a planned Antarctic cruise, she was recommissioned on 19 March 1949. Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleet, 1949-1955 Following shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay in April and May, Arneb cruised in the North Atlantic from June to October to test the effectiveness of the cold weather equipment installed. After her return to Norfolk on 1 November, the ship trained in Chesapeake Bay. Arneb, needed to supplement the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean in early 1950, returned to the east coast in May, and underwent a three-month availability. She resumed normal training and support services for the Atlantic Fleet when the Korean War compelled postponement of the Antarctic expedition. Nevertheless, the ship utilized her cold weather gear from March to December 1951 when she rendered logistic support to naval activities in England and North Africa, including an amphibious training operation in Greenland. Until March 1955, Arneb cruised primarily in the warm waters of the West Indies. From January to April 1952, the transport ferried cargo between islands in the West Indies. After a yard overhaul, she participated in the lengthy, large-scale NATO \\"Operation Mainbrace\\" in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean. After her return to the east coast in February 1953, Arneb made six cruises to the West Indies, before beginning preparations for an extended operation at Antarctica. Polar logistic support, 1955-1964 As a preliminary trial before her cruise southward, Arneb participated in an operation in waters north of the Arctic Circle along the east coast of Baffin Island in August and September and then returned to Norfolk for final outfitting. On 14 November 1955 Arneb got underway as flagship of \\"Operation Deep Freeze I\\" that would allow her to claim the distinction of crossing both the Arctic and Antarctic Circles in the course of one year. She transited the Panama Canal on 20 November, stopped at New Zealand and Franklin Island before arriving at Kainan Bay and McMurdo Sound, where she stayed from 27 December 1955 to 30 January 1956. She returned to the United States via the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean, completing her circumnavigation of the globe upon her arrival at Norfolk on 5 May 1956. USS Arneb listing to repair ice damage to the hull in 1957. After undergoing an overhaul from May to August and refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Arneb was prepared for \\"Operation Deep Freeze II.\\" She departed Norfolk in November; stopped at Wellington, New Zealand; entered the ice field on 16 December; and rendezvoused with the Coast Guard icebreaker . Arneb experienced no difficulty in following the icebreaker during the first day of movement through the frozen sea; but, on the 18th, a quarter-inch crack ‚Äî apparently caused by contact with ice during the previous two days ‚Äî appeared in her hull running some 31 inches above and below the waterline. Arneb's men repaired the damage, enabling the ship to make slow but steady progress toward McMurdo Sound, where the ships arrived on Christmas Eve. Upon completion of their work there, the two ships returned to Cape Hallett, where Arneb moored to the ice while Northwind proceeded into Moubray Bay to clear an unloading site. On the last day of 1956, the ice pack into which Arneb was nosed began to move and soon surrounded the ship with solid ice pressing against her hull. The framing on both sides of the ship began to buckle, rivets popped, seams split, and beams ripped. Frigid water and ice began flooding into several cargo holds at a combined rate of 1200 gallons per minute. Damage control parties worked doggedly to contain the inrush of water, but the men were only able to stay in the water for a few minutes at a time. Nevertheless, by using mattresses, steel plates, and shoring timbers, they managed to reduce the flow of water until the pumps could lower the water level. On 3 January 1957, the ice pack had loosened; and enabled Northwind to lead the battered Arneb into port. After unloading the cargo, the crew repaired the cracks and split seams by listing the ship alternately to port and to starboard. Although having suffered a bent rudder post and a broken propeller blade, Arneb was able to continue the operation. No further mishaps occurred until 30 January when Arneb, the icebreaker , and cargo ship attempted to push through the icepack off Knox Coast. A large chunk of ice broke off and brushed Arneb's port side, ripping a gash 12 feet long and one- half inch wide and once again flooding the holds as well as buckling plates, popping rivets, and opening seams. The experienced damage control parties used the same techniques to patch the new wounds in her hull. The ships then got underway again, with Glacier towing Arneb. Early the next morning, they arrived at Knox Coast and once again, the damage was repaired. Arneb left the ice fields on 17 February and steamed to Sydney, Australia, without incident. There, she went into drydock and, after minimum repairs, got underway on 28 February 1957 for the continental United States. In spite of her troubles with ice damage, Arneb made five more cruises to Antarctica to resupply the research stations and to transport hundreds of scientists involved in research on the frozen continent. During \\"Deep Freeze 61\\" she even delivered the foundation of a nuclear power plant to McMurdo Sound. Following \\"Deep Freeze 63,\\" Arneb was modified to enable her to return to normal duty with the Amphibious Force of the Atlantic Fleet. Operation Deepfreeze 1962-63 found the Arneb stranded on Christmas Day in 8' thick pressure ice well short of McMurdo Base. The DCA reported rivet heads popping off the inside hull of the large holds containing resupply materiel. The Coast Guard icebreaker Eastwind just ahead on what days earlier had appeared to be a navigable crack in the huge ice flow pack was actually squeezed clear of the water and was resting high and almost dry on the ice. They ran emergency water supplies to the Eastwind engines. Their Exec \\"captured\\" an Adelie penguin when he was out on the ice and got his uniform drenched in penguin guano for his trouble. The USS Edisto (a \\"Wind-class\\" ice breaker) appeared late on the 26th and together with a shift in the winds, the \\"channel\\" opened up and all three ships proceeded to McMurdo, each a bit worse for wear. The Captain of the Arneb, Capt. Riffenburgh, had begun to consider abandoning ship in the grimmer hours, but fortunately Arneb and crew did not have to do what the Endurance had done fifty some years earlier. Atlantic and Caribbean, 1965-1971 She underwent intensive training in amphibious operations through participation in major Caribbean exercises. In 1965, she transported much-needed supplies to American forces operating in the Caribbean during the crisis in the Dominican Republic. Arneb began a routine of operations in Atlantic and Caribbean waters and practiced with Navy and Marine Corps personnel in actual landings at Onslow Beach, N.C., and Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. During one such exercise, \\"LANTFLEX 66,\\" 94 Atlantic Fleet ships took part in a three-week opposed approach, landing, and departure from Vieques under the surveillance of a Soviet intelligence-gathering trawler. Between 8 February and 22 February 1967, Arneb was in drydock at the Bethlehem Steel Corp., in Baltimore. She then moved to the Berkeley yards of the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. for the remainder of her overhaul. With the overhaul completed and following refresher training during the summer of 1967, Arneb resumed her standard operating schedule of local Atlantic coast operations. Arneb deployed to the Mediterranean in January 1968 and spent five months there as part of the 6th Fleet's Amphibious Ready Force. In August 1968, the cargo ship became the first amphibious ship and the first AKA qualified for spacecraft recovery duty, and she was on station as the secondary recovery vehicle for the Apollo 7 flight in October. On 1 January 1969, Arneb was reclassified as an amphibious cargo ship, LKA-56. Arneb made three more Mediterranean cruises in 1969 and 1970 and participated in numerous Caribbean exercises before the Navy decided to end her naval service. Rather than inactivate and preserve the worn old ship, the Board of Inspection and Survey for the Atlantic Fleet recommended that Arneb be disposed of by sale. Decommissioning and sale Arneb was decommissioned at Norfolk on 12 August 1971, and her name was struck from the Navy List the following day. She was sold on 1 March 1973 to Andy International Inc. of Houston, Texas, and scrapped. Awards Arneb received four battle stars for her World War II service, and a Meritorious Unit Commendation for the recovery mission for Apollo 7.

He studied at the University of Edinburgh and was for some years on the stage; but having been ridiculed by Churchill in The Rosciad he gave up acting and opened a bookshop in Covent Garden. It was here that in 1763 he introduced Boswell to Dr. Johnson, who was his close friend and to whom he dedicated his edition of the works of Massinger. He wrote a successful Life of Garrick (1780), which passed through four editions, and Dramatic Miscellanies (three volumes, 1783-4). Thomas Davies, 1794 engraving by Luigi Schiavonetti, after Thomas Hickey Life He was born about 1713, and was educated at the University of Edinburgh (1728 and 1729). In 1736 he appeared in George Lillo's Fatal Curiosity at the Haymarket, then under Henry Fielding's management. He then tried bookselling, but failed and returned to the stage. On 24 January 1746 he attempted the part of Pierre in Venice Preserved, which was performed for his benefit at Covent Garden. He next became a travelling actor, and married the daughter of an actor at York, named Yarrow. Davies performed at Edinburgh, where he was accused of monopolising popular parts, and then at Dublin. In 1753 he was engaged with his wife at Drury Lane, with some success as understudies. In 1761 appeared Churchill's Rosciad, in which the line \\"He mouths a sentence as curs mouth a bone\\" which, according to Samuel Johnson, drove Davies from the stage. Davies apparently left the stage in 1762, when he again set up as a bookseller at 8 Russell Street, Covent Garden. Here in 1763 he introduced James Boswell (who had been introduced to him by Samuel Derrick) to Johnson. Davies was a member of a booksellers' club which met at the Devil Tavern, Temple Bar, and then at the Grecian Coffee-house, where he used to read parts of his Life of Garrick and where Johnson's Lives of the Poets was suggested. Davies died on 5 May 1785, and was buried in St. Paul's, Covent Garden. Johnson punished him for an indiscretion by observing contemptuously that Jonathan Swift's Conduct of the Allies might have been written by Tom Davies, but in two letters written at the end of his life expressed his gratitude for the care of Davies and his wife. Publisher Davies republished the works of authors including William Browne (1772), Sir John Davies (1773), John Eachard (1774), George Lillo (1775), and Philip Massinger, with some account of his life and writings prefixed (1779). In 1773 he published Miscellaneous and Fugitive Pieces, in two volumes, and advertised them as by the author of The Rambler. Johnson's writings, without authority, formed the bulk of this collection; but Johnson was disarmed by Davies's good- nature and professions of penitence. In 1778 Davies became bankrupt, and Johnson exerted his influence on Davies's behalf, collected money to buy back his furniture, and induced Richard Brinsley Sheridan to give him a benefit at Drury Lane. Davies then appeared for the last time as Fainall in William Congreve's The Way of the World. Next year Davies dedicated his Massinger to Johnson. Johnson later encouraged Davies to write the life of Garrick, supplied the first sentence, and gave help with Garrick's early years. The book appeared in 1780, passed through four editions, and brought money and reputation to the author. Encouraged by this success, he published in 1785 Dramatic Miscellanies, consisting of critical observations on several plays of Shakespeare, with a review of his principal characters and those of various eminent writers, as represented by Mr. Garrick and other celebrated comedians.

He played professionally for the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) from 1937 to 1938 and in 1940. He attended Louisiana State University, where he was a consensus All-American for the LSU Tigers football team in 1935 and 1936. In 1937 he was drafted by the Cardinals, with whom he was an All-NFL selection in 1937 and 1938. During his three years in the NFL, Tinsley set or tied NFL single-season records with 674 receiving yards in 1937 and 41 pass receptions in 1938. He later served as the head football coach at LSU from 1948 to 1954. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956. College career Tinsley was born in Ruple, Louisiana and raised in Homer, Louisiana in the northern part of the state. He attended Louisiana State University where he played football and baseball and was selected as the captain of both teams. He was considered one of the greatest receivers in college football, earning consensus All-American honors in both 1935 and 1936. As a junior in 1935, Tinsley was named a first- team All-American by the Associated Press, United Press, Liberty (selected based on a poll of 1,521 varsity players in all parts of the country), Collier's Weekly, the Newspaper Editors Association, the International News Service, and The New York Sun. At the time, at age 19 he was one of the youngest ever named to the All-America team. In 1936, Tinsley repeated as a first-team All-American with each of these publications and also received the first-team designation from the Central Press Association (selected by the captains of more than 50 college football teams at \\"important universities and colleges throughout the United States\\"), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation. Tinsley while at LSU Tinsley's profile at the College Football Hall of Fame describes him as such: \\"Tinsley was a magnificent athletic specimen, standing 6-0, and weighing 196-pounds, size he used equally well as a defensive stalwart who was a blocking master.\\" As a sophomore in 1934, Tinsley had a 65-yard pass reception, thrown by halfback Abe Mickal, against Southern Methodist University, which stood as a record for several years as \\"the longest pass in Southern football history.\\" Tinsley's coach at LSU, Bernie Moore, once said, \\"Tinsley could have made All-American at any position. He was so tough, he made blockers quit. He's the greatest lineman I ever saw.\\" Tinsley concluded his college career by playing in the Chicago College All-Star Game, an annual game between college all-stars and an NFL team. Tinsley scored the only points of the game on a 47-yard touchdown pass from Sammy Baugh, as the college players defeated the Green Bay Packers, 6‚Äì0. This was the first victory for the college players against the professionals in the series. In 1993, LSU selected its all-time team as part of the celebration of the centennial of LSU football.

Professional career Tinsley was drafted by the Chicago Cardinals as the 12th overall pick in the 1937 NFL Draft. He played for the Cardinals for three years: in 1937, 1938 and 1940. As a rookie in 1937, Tinsley set an NFL record with 675 receiving yards. He also ranked among the NFL's 1937 leaders in several categories, including 36 receptions (second in the NFL), 675 receiving yards (first in the NFL), 677 total yards from scrimmage (second in the NFL), five receiving touchdowns (second in the NFL), 18.8 yards per reception (first in the NFL) and 61.4 receiving yards per game (first in the NFL). At the end of the 1937 season, Tinsley was selected as a first-team All-NFL player by the United Press, the NFL, New York Daily News, and Collyers Eye magazine. Tinsley twice set the record for the longest pass reception in NFL history. He set the mark first in 1937, when he caught a 97-yard pass from Pat Coffee for a touchdown against the Chicago Bears. He broke his own record the following season, against the Cleveland Rams in the Cardinals' final game, with a 98-yard touchdown reception from Doug Russell. Several NFL receivers have since recorded 99-yard receptions, but Tinsley's 98-yarder remains a Cardinals franchise record (although it has been tied twice).Cardinals franchise passing records. Arizona Cardinals. Retrieved September 23, 2016. In 1938, Tinsley continued as one of the league's top receivers. He caught passes in nine of the Cardinals' eleven games during the season. His 41 receptions in 1938 tied the all-time NFL single-season record, set by Don Hutson two seasons prior. He also ranked among the 1938 league leaders with 516 receiving yards (second in the NFL) and 46.9 yards per game (fourth in the NFL). He was again selected as a first-team All-NFL player, this time receiving the honor from Pro Football Writers, the NFL, and Collyers Eye magazine. In March 1939, Tinsley signed a contract to play professional minor league baseball for the Marshall Tigers of the East Texas League. He also left the Cardinals a week into training camp to take up a head coaching position at Haynesville High School in Haynesville, Louisiana, replacing Cecil Crowley. He returned to the NFL and played in seven games in 1940 before he suffered a torn ligament in his left knee while making a tackle against the Cleveland Rams, which effectively ended his season. When Tinsley retired, he ranked fourth in NFL history in pass receptions, despite having played only three seasons of professional football. At the time, he was cited along with Don Hutson as being one of \\"the two greatest pass receivers of all time.\\" Coaching career After service in the U.S. Navy, Tinsley worked as a high school football coach in Haynesville, Louisiana. He then served as an assistant football coach at LSU through the 1947 season. In 1948, LSU's long-time football coach, Bernie Moore, retired, and Tinsley was promoted to replace his former mentor. In 1949, Tinsley's team finished the regular season 8‚Äì2 and played in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma. He became the first person to participate in the Sugar Bowl as both a player and a head coach. Tinsley's LSU teams never met with the same success they had achieved in 1949. In seven years as head coach at LSU, Tinsley's teams compiled a record of 35‚Äì34‚Äì6. Displeased with the team's performance, the LSU board of supervisors fired Tinsley in February 1955, though they agreed to pay his salary of $12,500 per year for the two remaining years on his contract. After the vote to remove him, Tinsley said, \\"I have not made any future plans as yet, but I do know that I will continue to help LSU whenever and wherever I can.\\" Later years Tinsley was named to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956. He was elected as one of three charter members to the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1959. Despite playing only two seasons during the decade, he was voted to the NFL 1930s All-Decade Team.

Founded from the Laura Hecox collection in 1905, the Museum's collections grew extensively throughout the years, acquiring many Native American and archaeological artifacts, as well as natural history specimens. Currently, the Museum is housed in a Carnegie Library, named after the Carnegie philanthropic foundation that funded the construction of the library in 1915. History=Founding The Museum traces its beginnings to the late 19th century and the collection of naturalist Laura Hecox. Miss Hecox was born in Santa Cruz in 1854 and from childhood had a keen interest in the natural sciences. Her parents, Adna and Margaret Hecox, traveled overland from Illinois to California in 1846 and settled in Santa Cruz the following year. In 1869 Mr. Hecox was appointed keeper of the original Santa Cruz Lighthouse and took up residence there with his wife and family. Young Laura soon began collecting seashells, minerals, fossils, Indian artifacts, and other specimens and curios, turning part of the lighthouse into a private nature museum. In 1883 Adna Hecox died and Laura Hecox was appointed lighthouse keeper by the federal government. She stayed at the post for thirty-three years. On weekends she gave public tours of the lighthouse including her personal natural history museum. Although interested in all of natural history, her specialty was mollusks. She corresponded with prominent scientists of the day and had at least two mollusk species named in her honor. Carnegie Library In 1904 Laura Hecox deeded her collection to the City of Santa Cruz for the establishment of its first public museum. The following year, the Hecox Museum opened in the basement of the new Carnegie Library, which was located on the site of the present Central Library. Dr. Charles Lewis Anderson, local physician and naturalist, served on the library Board of Trustees and played a key role in establishing both the library and museum. The Museum opened August 21, 1905. There were displays of dried sea stars and crustaceans, Indian baskets and mortars, Eskimo artifacts, minerals, agates, gems, petrified woods, coral, bird nests and eggs, turtle and tortoise carapaces, and several cases of shells, including two hundred local species. In a short speech, Laura Hecox said that she did not feel that she was losing anything in giving the collection but rather was merely taking everyone else into partnership with her in the enjoyment of it. The Hecox collection remained at the library until about 1917 when it was moved to the new Santa Cruz High School. In 1929 Humphrey Pilkington bequeathed his large collection of Indian artifacts to the City of Santa Cruz under the condition that a museum be established to store and display it. Pilkington was a forester and agriculturist and was the first warden at California Redwood Park, what is now called Big Basin Redwoods State Park. Move to the Seabright neighborhood The Crafts House, home of the Museum from 1930 to 1954, was located behind the present museum where the amphitheater is now. The Santa Cruz Art League used the basement. In 1930 the Pilkington collection was set up at the Crafts House in Tyrrell Park in Santa Cruz's Seabright neighborhood. A volunteer Board of Trustees was appointed by the City Council, and they elected trustee Jed Scott as first curator. In 1932, through the efforts of Curator Scott, the Hecox collection joined the Pilkington collection in Seabright. During the 1930s and 1940s the Museum also maintained a public aquarium on the Santa Cruz Wharf. In 1947 the Museum Commission was established to advise the Santa Cruz City Council on museum matters. This gave the Museum formal legal status within city government and paved the way to someday expand and hire a staff. In 1954 the old Crafts House was condemned and the Museum moved next door to the Seabright Branch Library building, a Carnegie Library built in 1915. The joint Museum-Library opened October 10, 1954. In 1960 Dr. Glenn Bradt was appointed to the Museum Commission. Bradt had a Ph.D. in mammalogy and was retired from the Michigan Department of Conservation. During his tenure as a nearly full-time Museum advocate and volunteer, two additions were built onto the old library building (in 1962 and 1968), all the exhibits were redone, and in 1969 the first full- time curator was hired. Bradt also forged ties between the Museum and the new community college and university. Governance In 1969 Charles Prentiss was hired as curator. He came to the job with a college background in both biology and art. During his twenty-nine years at the Museum, programs, staff, collections, and exhibits continued to improve and expand. In the 1970s annual exhibits such as the Fungus Fair and Spring Wildflower Show were inaugurated and the first of many special exhibits held. Thanks to hundreds of donations during this period, the collection of specimens and artifacts grew to over 16,000 items. In 1978 the Santa Cruz Museum Association formed as the museum's non-profit membership arm. In 1980 the docent program began. Docents currently give tours to 6,000 school children each year. In 1981 the interior of the museum building was extensively remodeled and all new exhibits constructed. In 1982 the life-size gray whale model was built with funds raised by the Museum Association. In 1998 Greg Moyce, with the title Museum Director, replaced retiring curator Charles Prentiss. Jenifer Lienau-Thompson joined the museum in 1998 as well, stepping into a lead role in 2005 when Moyce moved to Oregon to pursue a career in exhibit design. The museum celebrated its centennial in August of that year. Observing the popularity of the annual Illustrating Nature exhibit, she instituted a program of hosting additional temporary exhibits at the museum each year, on topics as wide-ranging as renewable energy, caves, water use, and bird migration; she collaborated with a local elementary school to create an exhibit on the threat to birds posed by plastic refuse left on beaches. She was named museum director in 2008, serving until February 2009. In 2009, to avert closure due to lack of funding, the City of Santa Cruz entered an agreement to turn over operation of the museum to its long-time non-profit partner, the Santa Cruz Museum Association. In late 2010, the Museum Association board hired its first Executive Director of the fledgling non-profit museum. Dr. Daniel Harder was a botanist and had been the former director of the UCSC Arboretum. In November 2012, the Museum Association changed its name to the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History to more clearly align the organization with the Museum and make a clear separation from the previous City management. Dr. Harder continued in his role until the summer of 2014. In early 2015, Heather Moffat was hired as Executive Director. Moffat is a paleontologist and museum educator. Prior to joining the Museum team, she was the Director of Education and Exhibits for the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History and its Sea Center. . Moffat's tenure at the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History continued through the fall of 2018. In the fall of 2019, after a yearlong search, the Board of Directors was excited to recognize one of the local emerging leaders in the region and decided to make a promotion from within the organization. After years as the Museum's Education Director, Felicia Van Stolk was appointed as Executive Director. Director Van Stolk looks forward to building on the Museum's recent successes increasing scientific literacy and appreciation of the natural world among local residents and visitors alike. Van Stolk said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an exciting time to work at the Museum as we expand our programs to serve a more diverse population and become a regional leader in environmental education.\\" Through the creation of innovative new exhibit experiences and further strengthening of nature-based education programs, the Museum continues to deepen visitors‚Äô experiences to help them each construct a very personal understanding of the natural world and their role in it. Surfing museum addition In 1984 the museum built outdoor exhibit kiosks on the Santa Cruz Wharf featuring marine life, fishing, and the wharf's history. In 1986 the Santa Cruz Surfing Museum was established as a satellite facility at the Mark Abbott Memorial Lighthouse. The displays of old surfboards and historical photographs attract 70,000 visitors each year. The City of Santa Cruz operates the Santa Cruz Surfing Museum.

By doing so, it bypasses the Carnot cycle and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40-45% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors. The fission fragment ion beam would be passed through a magnetohydrodynamic generator to produce electricity. Fission fragment reactor designs generally have several common components. The reactor chamber contains a high surface area nuclear fuel to both facilitate direct emission of fission fragments and assist in cooling the fuel. Generally, if fuels subject to criticality are used instead of those that naturally decay (as in a nuclear battery), a moderator is typically involved as well. A magnetic mirror induced by an axial magnetic field typically collates the fragments into a beam that can then be decelerated to generate power. The rate the particles decelerate at depends on their energy; as a consequence, the deceleration process also can help provide isotopic separation as an automatic reprocessing stage. The potential could exist for conventional nuclear waste to be processed via the use of fission fragment reactors . An earlier design by scientists at Idaho National Engineering Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory involved the concept of coating fine carbon wires with fissionable fuel. While this had a high surface area, it proved not enough to radiate the heat absorbed during the reactions, so their design was modified to rotate long wires through the core, giving them time to cool. A later design by Rodney A. Clark and Robert B. Sheldonhttp://www.rbsp.info/rbs/PDF/aiaa05.pdf Dusty Plasma Based Fission Fragment Nuclear Reactor, 41st AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference & Exhibit, July 10‚Äì13, 2005, Tucson, AZ involves the use of a dusty plasma of electrostatically suspended fuel nanoparticles in the core. This increases the surface area enough to allow for effective radiative cooling. As the particles naturally ionize as fission occurs, electrostatic suspension is a simple process. Direct energy conversion In the early 2000s, research was undertaken by Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory, The University of Florida, Texas A&M; University and General Atomics to use direct conversion to extract energy from fission reactions. Essentially, attempting to extract energy from the linear motion of charged particles coming off a fission reaction.

They were known for the lyrical content of their songs, which is often concerned with the band's homoerotic obsession over the actor Johnny Depp. History Formed from ex-members of post-hardcore bands Garrison and Instruction in 2004, Gay for Johnny Depp released their first recording effort, Erotically Charged Dance Songs for the Desperate, on 12 July 2004. The 5-track EP was met with positive reviews which often compared Gay for Johnny Depp to fellow hardcore bands The Blood Brothers and The Locust. The band recorded their second EP, Blood: The Natural Lubricant (An Apocalyptic Adventure Beyond Sodom and Gomorrah), in the summer of 2005, and released it on 19 September 2005 on the UK label Captains Of Industry. This was supported by a small tour of the UK. The record gained Gay for Johnny Depp a lot of fans, due to the unusual song titles as much as the music itself. Gay for Johnny Depp played their first ever UK show on September 14, 2005 in Exeter, supporting Million Dead. During the show, frontman Marty Leopard was punched by an angry crowd member and had to go to the hospital to receive 5 stitches in his face. On 9 June 2006 Gay for Johnny Depp played at the Download Festival in Donington Park, UK. In that same year, their song Sex In Your Mouth was released on the Kerrang! compilation album, New Breed. The band's first full-length album, The Politics of Cruelty, was released on 5 November 2007; it was rare example of a hardcore band receiving positive reviews in publications such as NME, Q, The Guardian and Uncut as well as heavier rock publications such as Rock Sound. A number of tracks also aired on BBC Radio 1. Instead of featuring the usual biographical material, advance copies of the album sent to the media contained a highly explicit pornographic fan letter to actor Johnny Depp, purported to be written by someone simply known as 'Brad'. This approach was in keeping with the band's previous promotional material, which have included bottles of amyl nitrite, surgical rubber gloves, condoms, explicit homosexual photographs and further explicit letters from 'Brad'. The band's debut album featured in the NME Top 10 chart throughout November 2007. That same month singer Marty was invited to take part in the NME's annual Pub Golf feature. Highlights of the evening have subsequently appeared on the internet. Gay For Johnny Depp toured the UK in January and February 2008 and in April 2008 wearing nothing but socks on covering their private parts. They toured the UK again between 13th Nov and 4th Dec 2009. The band's second studio album What Doesn't Kill You, Eventually Kills You was released on February 14, 2011. On 31 October 2011 they released a YouTube video and an email to their mailing list announcing they were going their separate ways. Their second EP, Blood: The Natural Lubricant (An Apocalyptic Adventure Beyond Sodom and Gomorrah) was re-released in September 2012, this time on vinyl limited to 300 copies through independent UK label Moshtache Records. Style Gay for Johnny Depp have been described as spazzcore, hardcore, and metal. They are most well known for their vulgar, homoerotic lyrics focused around Johnny Depp; for example on \\"Kill The Cool Kids\\", Leopard sings \\"Cos I want my Johnny bleeding, fuck him in the ass!\\" The vocals are most often delivered in a high-pitched scream reminiscent of bands such as Ed Gein, The Locust, The Blood Brothers. Musically, the band are recognisable for a frantic, relentless style, with few songs lasting more than three minutes in length. The band have been remixed by The Blacksmoke Organisation.

For many years, it was not held in high regard, since 2...d5 was thought to allow Black easy .Siegbert Tarrasch wrote, using descriptive chess notation, \\"To 2.P-QB3? Black can advantageously reply with 2...P-Q4!.\\" Siegbert Tarrasch, The Game of Chess, David McKay, 1938, p. 322. (1994 Hays Publishing edition).Walter Korn, much like Tarrasch, dismissed the Alapin with \\"2...P-Q4!=.\\" Walter Korn, Modern Chess Openings, 11th Edition (commonly referred to as MCO-11), Pitman Publishing, 1972, p. 148. . Today, the Alapin is considered to be one of the most and respectable , and it is championed by grandmasters such as Evgeny Sveshnikov, Eduardas Rozentalis, Sergei Tiviakov, Du≈°ko Pavasoviƒç, and Drazen Sermek. It has been played by World Champions Viswanathan Anand, Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Veselin Topalov, and Vladimir Kramnik. Deep Blue played the Alapin Variation against Kasparov in their 1996 match in order to avoid a main line Sicilian that would walk into Kasparov's lifetime of experience with the opening. The Alapin is also seen in deferred form, particularly when Black chooses an unusual second move after 2.Nf3. For example, after 2.Nf3 a6 or 2.Nf3 Qc7, 3.c3 is often seen, since neither ...a6 nor ...Qc7 are particularly useful moves against the Alapin. Main variations=2...Nf6 The main line in current practice is 2... Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 and can also arise if White offers, and Black declines, the Smith‚ÄìMorra Gambit (1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 Nf6 4.e5 Nd5). White has a number of options including 4.d4, 4.Nf3, 4.g3 and 4.Bc4. 2...d5 This is the main alternative to 2...Nf6 for Black. The usual continuation is 3. exd5 Qxd5, a line known as the Barmen Defense. 3.e5 may transpose to the Advance Variation of the French Defence if Black responds with 3...e6, but Black can also develop his c8-bishop before playing e6. This leads to a favourable version of the French for Black, since the bishop is no longer hemmed in by the pawn chain. If White plays 3.exd5, 3...Nf6 is possible, but it is not clear whether Black receives sufficient compensation for the pawn. The main options revolve around: *4. d4 Nc6 and now 5.dxc5 or 5.Nf3 *4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 when after both 5...e6 and 5...Bg4 White can try a number of different moves. 2...e6 This is Black's most solid response, preparing 3...d5. It is closely related to the French Defense, to which it often transposes. White can transpose to the Advance Variation of the French Defense with 3.d4 d5 4.e5. Alternatively, White can transpose to a sort of Tarrasch French with 3.d4 d5 4.Nd2, or try to demonstrate a slight advantage with 3.d4 d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.Be3. 2...d6 This is a response. Black often offers a with 3.d4 Nf6 4.dxc5 Nc6 (4...Nxe4?? 5.Qa4+) 5.cxd6 Nxe4. White can instead play , however, with 3.d4 Nf6 4.Bd3, occupying the and maintaining a advantage. Other tries=2...e5 This move makes it hard for White to play d4, but seriously weakens the d5-square. Play usually continues 3.Nf3 Nc6 4.Bc4, with a solid for White.

In 1999 he co-founded the low-bit art collective 8bitpeoples, and has served as its lead director since its inception. He is best known for his high-energy Game Boy pop songs. Johnson graduated from the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University in 2003, where he studied computer science and music. He uses Game Boys and NES consoles to create music. Biography=1980 to 1998: Formative Experiences Born on a United States Air Force base, March AFB in Riverside, California, Johnson's family relocated to New York upon his father's honorable discharge from the USAF shortly after his birth. Most of his childhood was spent on suburban Long Island, where he attended Islip High School and lived with his mother and brother until he was 18 years old. Johnson has cited the film Electric Dreams as an influential force in his early musical pursuits. Inspired by a Giorgio Moroder arrangement of a minuet featured in the film, Johnson took 3 weeks of cello lessons during one summer of his adolescence. This would be the only formal musical training he would have until entering university. However, Moroder's synthesizer-driven Italo disco style would have a more lasting effect. Throughout his high school years, Johnson spent increasing amounts of time working with computers, coding BASIC programs with his younger brother, following the demoscene, and exploring the web. It was during this time that he met Mike Hanlon in an Internet chatroom ‚Äì together the two would go on to found 8bitpeoples. 1999 to 2004: Early History In September 1999, Johnson began studying at Columbia University in New York City. Around this time the idea for 8bitpeoples was born out of an IM conversation he had with friend Mike Hanlon. The idea for the group centered on forming a collective of like-minded musicians, who were inspired or influenced by the aesthetics of early videogames and were interested in offering their music for free through digital distribution. Johnson put together their first website and hosted it on the desktop computer in his university dorm room. Early on he established himself as the driving force behind the group, acting as organizing and directing 8bitpeoples, while also actively contributing as an artist. His early works bear little resemblance to the style and direction that his music would later take. Wooden Polyurethane Papers, his first release, is a silly and playful collection of loosely constructed songs with a penchant for raw waveforms, simplistic synths, and low-quality samples. He followed this with Click Bleep Click, a 3-track EP consisting of much more complex compositions that tend toward bittersweet melodies, processed videogame samples, and field recordings from around Manhattan. This is an interesting entry within Nullsleep's discography as it shows a very different direction that could have been pursued, but was instead apparently abandoned. With his next two releases on 8bitpeoples, Hello World and The Gameboy Singles 2002, Nullsleep focused once again on playful simplicity. The latter of these two was his first release to be composed entirely on the Game Boy (using the LSDJ tracker) and marks the beginning of his period working exclusively with videogame hardware. That same year, Nullsleep was also working on his Depeche Mode Megamix, a 14+ minute Game Boy composition paying tribute to the influential synthpop band Depeche Mode. The megamix (composed of Enjoy the Silence, Photographic, New Life, and Everything Counts) was only performed live once, during a show at Remote Lounge in New York. During the performance the Game Boy which Nullsleep was performing on crashed and wiped out the contents of the cartridge, forcing him to play the second half of the mix from a backup recording. This recording was later released on 8bitpeoples along with a condensed minimix version, and has since been downloaded over 100,000+ times. Around this same period of time, Nullsleep began exploring music composition on the Nintendo Entertainment System using a program called MCK which takes music macro language (MML) as input. He would go on to release a number of NES chiptunes through his personal site, but they would remain mostly unreleased through 8bitpeoples, with the exception of his Axel F and Silent Night arrangements on two different compilations. While Nullsleep continues to compose and perform using the NES (and later the Famicom), the bulk of his creative efforts remain attached to the Game Boy.

She was the wife and partner of Ewing Kauffman. Ewing and Muriel worked together at Marion Labs and were the founding owners of the Kansas City Royals baseball team. She was born in Toronto, Ontario, graduated from the Trafalgar Castle School in Whitby, Ontario and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. Her father was Toronto lawyer and politician Fred McBrien. She met Ewing the early 1960s in Miami, Florida. He was attending a medical convention and she was vacationing at the same hotel. They married in February 1962. After her death, her remains were interred at the Ewing and Muriel Kauffman Memorial Garden next to her husband's remains. in 1987, the Foundations for Ewing and Muriel split due to their diverse interests; Muriel focused her philanthropic effort on performing and visual arts, as well as causes related to healthcare, whereas Ewing's favorite charities revolved around education and entrepreneurial support. Muriel's legacy is further cemented with her receipt of the Mr. Baseball Award from the Baseball Writer Association of America, the William Booth Award from the Salvation Army, and, with her husband, the 1986 Mankind Award from the Heart of America Chapter of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Muriel was named a director of UMB in 1971, and she was granted an honorary doctor of law degree from McMaster University (her undergraduate alma mater) in 1985.  Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts  In 1994, Muriel dedicated much of her foundation's effort to realizing the construction of the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. Upon Muriel Kauffman's death, Julia Irene Kauffman (Muriel's daughter) carried forward her mother's idea to build a performing arts center in Kansas City. As chairman of the Muriel McBrien Kauffman Foundation, Julia Kauffman worked to turn her mother's dream into a performing arts center. In the Crossroads District of Kansas City, Missouri, the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts was opened in the fall of 2011. The center includes a 1,600-seat concert hall and a 1,800-seat proscenium theater, and is the performance home for the Kansas City Symphony, the Lyric Opera of Kansas City, and the Kansas City Ballet. The Kauffman Center also features a diverse range of performances in both halls including dance and music of all types from pop to rock, light classical to country, jazz groups to bands, and gospel to folk music, as well as smaller Broadway and off-Broadway touring productions.

The studios were actually located in Marion, North Carolina. The station was sold to Blue Dolphin Communications in November, 1996. The station made an attempt to move into the Asheville market in 1998 as the format was changed to hot adult contemporary as \\"Mix 104\\" under the new call letters of WMXF. It was the first hit-oriented pop station since WKSF went country more than a decade earlier, with a format that was essentially \\"Top 40 without the head-banging rock or rap\\". Artists included Elton John and The Spice Girls. Anna \\"Dawn\\" Creasman, formerly of WISE, WKSF and WZLS, was one of the DJs. When they switched from live DJs to satellite which caused a lot of public disapproval. The original company they contracted with was Jones Satellite out of Colorado. Another station in the area--WKBC-FM‚Äîalso carried Jones Hot AC during the day and the overnight, meaning both stations played the same songs and had the same DJs. Jones was dropped for this reason, and for not being contemporary enough, and ABC Radio Networks hot AC was added. When Mix 104 went to satellite they added the Bob and Sheri morning show from WLNK, which was dropped abruptly by station management, due to public complaints. They added Scott and Todd in the Morning from New York City which was not greeted well due to the market. In late 1998 the studio was moved from Marion to Asheville soon after the tower was moved from Wildcat Mountain outside of Old Fort to a tower outside of Asheville. Because of the mountainous terrain in the Asheville market, the station signal range was still limited. Star 104.3's former logo from approximately 2005 to April 2015.

They tend to live on wetlands and hillsides. The larvae spin together the leaves of their food plants (such as birch and bog myrtle) to form their cocoons. It was named argent and sable in 1778. Argent and sable refer to the heraldic color names for white and black. Their distribution is Holarctic. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Caterpillar Distribution The species occurs in almost all parts of Europe. The distribution area stretches over the northern Asia to the Russian Far East and large parts of China on to Japan. The species occurs in large parts of North America. Currently three subspecies are distinguished Rheumaptera hastata hastata, Rheumaptera hastata nigrescens and Rheumaptera hastata thulearia. Museum specimen Description The wings have a black ground color with variable white pattern elements. A wider inner cross and a narrow basal cross line are typical. The dark midfield is traversed by white patches, which may be continuous. The outer cross line forms a wide white band, which usually has a row of black dots. In the black area of the margin is a wavy line broken into white stains, which forms an arrow- or spearhead-shaped element (R. hastata is Latin for spear shaped). The fringes are black and white patched. The pattern of the hindwing is similar to the forewing. In some forms the black tone is reduced on a few black stains. Variation R. hastata is extremely variable and splits up into several local races. The nominotypical subspecies R. h. hastata form is large, with the median band strongly broken behind the middle, and intensely black markings. Form laxata Krulik has the white areas still further widened, the postmedian band much broader than usual, the black median markings narrowed and broken, and no black dots in the postmedian band. Form demolita Prout is a more extreme form, the black median band only remaining as a small patch on the discocellulars and a small one at the hindmargin.

Cain's novella Double Indemnity. In the 1944 production, she was played by Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film version. Stanwyck's portrayal of Dietrichson is considered one of the best femme fatale roles in Film noir history.History of American Cinema accessed 1-4-2016iconic role accessed 1-4-2016 The character was ranked as the #8 film villain of the first 100 years of American cinema by the American Film Institute in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains.AFI List accessed 1-4-2016 Character biography In both the novella and films, she manipulates her husband's insurance agent, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray in the 1944 production) to help her murder her husband. They first trick her husband, Mr. Dietrichson into signing a life insurance policy without his knowledge. The policy has a double indemnity clause whereby the company agrees to pay the stated multiple (i.e., double) of the face amount in the contract in cases of death caused by accidental means. They then murder her husband and try to make it seem like an accident on a train in an attempt to invoke the policy's double indemnity clause. Though they succeed in the deed, Phyllis soon runs into several problems in trying to invoke the clause and collect the money. The next day much to her dismay, Phyllis finds out that the company has refused to pay the double indemnity clause for they didn't know about Mr. Dietrichson's broken leg before his death. Their suspicions catches the attention of Neff's boss, Barton Keyes, who encourages them to investigate the whole thing, making both her and Neff nervous. Phyllis realizes too late that Dietrichson eventually found out about her plan to murder him and had changed his will to spite her. He left the inheritance to his daughter (her stepdaughter), Lola and thus leaving her with nothing. She knows her stepdaughter is a threat to her because Lola suspected her of murdering her father in a similar manner to her mother and tries to get Neff to kill her (which fails after he befriended Lola and learned more about her family's tragic past). Phyllis must also contend with the inquisitive Keyes who also suspects she was involved in the murder of Mr. Dietrichson and whom he believed she had an accomplice in Nino, due to them secretly seeing each other. She tries to kill Neff to clean up any loose ends, but couldn't fire the last shot because she had fallen in love with him. Neff doesn't believe Phyllis, calling her a rotten, manipulative woman, and kills her in the ensuing struggle. After killing her, Neff meets Nino outside and convinces him not to go inside the house, but to the woman who truly loves him. After doing so, a shot Neff returns to his place of work and confesses to his wrongdoing in his office, via Dictaphone. Keyes comes in and has overheard his confession in murdering both Mr. Dietrichson and Phyllis. He informs Neff that the police are coming over to arrest him for the murders. As he tries to escape planning to live out his life in Mexico rather than face the death penalty, Neff collapses to the floor near the elevator. Keyes offer him a cigarette as they wait for police to arrive to arrest Neff for the murders of Mr. Dietrichson and Phyllis. Casting The Dietrichson character was so iniquitous that Stanwyck, director Billy Wilder's first choice for the role in the 1944 version, was reluctant to take it. Wilder was persistent, however, and Stanwyck eventually relented; she said thereafter it was one of the best roles she had ever played. Novel vs film In James M. Cain's original novella, the character is named Phyllis Nirdlinger (Wilder changed the name for the film adaptation, as he thought it sounded too comical). In the novella, Phyllis is a former nurse who was suspected of killing several children in her care; the case was dropped for lack of evidence. Also, in the novel's climax, she escapes with Neff (here called Huff) and goes away with him on an ocean liner; there, she kills him, too. It is implied at the end of the novel that she will be arrested. Details *The character was based upon real-life murderer Ruth Snyder.

Examples of surfboards from each era are on display, from the huge hollow paddle boards and redwood planks made and ridden in the 1930s and 1940s to examples of early foam and fiberglass boards, and speedy short boards used to create radical new surf moves beginning in the 1970s.

He achieved prominence under the administration of Edward III of England. He was responsible for the 1351 Statute of Labourers and Statute of Treasons. He is briefly mentioned in the poem Wynnere and Wastoure, dating from the 1350s.  Early life  Shareshull came from humble Staffordshire origins in the village of Shareshill.  Career  He is mentioned among the advocates in the ‚ÄòYear Book‚Äô of Edward II. He received a commission of oyer and terminer on 22 February 1327 and in the two following years. In 1331, when he had risen to the rank of king's serjeant, he was appointed with others to assess a tallage in Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, and Berkshire (25 June). The following year he was one of the council selected by the king to advise him and was ordered on 11 October to attend the approaching parliament in Scotland for the confirmation of the treaty with Edward Balliol. He was made a Knight of the Bath.  Judge  On 20 March 1333, he was made a judge of the King's Bench, but was removed to the Common Pleas on 30 May following. On 30 November 1340, Edward III returned from the Low Countries and removed the chancellor, treasurer and other prominent officials, among them Shareshull, on a charge of maladministration. He was reinstated on 10 May 1342 and on 2 July 1344 he was made Chief Baron of the Exchequer. On 10 November 1345 he was moved back to the Common Pleas, with the title of second justice. He was appointed one of the guardians of the principality of Wales during the minority of the king's son. In 1346 he was styled ‚Äúcouncillor and kinsman‚Äù of William de Montagu, Earl of Salisbury.Cal. of Patent Rolls, 1345‚Äì1348 (1903): 139‚Äì141  Chief judge  On 26 October 1350, he was advanced to the headship of the Court of King's Bench and presided over it until 5 July 1357. While holding that office he declared the causes of the meeting of five parliaments, from 25 to 29 Edward III (1351‚Äì1355). His functions seem to have more resembled those of a political and parliamentary official than those of a judge. In 1358 Shareshull, Edward de Montagu, and two others, executors of Elizabeth de Montagu, Countess of Salisbury, sued John Runaway in the Court of Common Pleas regarding a reasonable account of the time he was Elizabeth's bailiff in Worksop, Nottinghamshire and her receiver of money. In the last year of his chief-justiceship he was excommunicated by the Pope, for refusing to appear when summoned to answer for a sentence he had delivered against Thomas Lisle, the Bishop of Ely for harbouring a man who had slain a servant of Blanche, Lady Wake. In 1344 some sailors thought Shareshull (there called Sharford) stayed too long at dinner when he was holding assizes in that town. One of them mounted the bench and fined the judge for non-attendance. He took such offense at the joke that he induced the king to take away the assizes from the town and took the liberties of the corporation into his own hands for about a year.  Retirement  Though retired from the bench, he occupied confidential positions as late as 1361. He lived beyond 1364, in which year he granted his manor of Alurynton in Shropshire to Osney Priory, in addition to lands at Sandford in Oxfordshire, which he had given seven years before. He was a benefactor to the priories of Bruera, near Chester and Dudley. He left a son of the same name.

Their descendants include Queen Catherine Parr, the last consort of King Henry VIII. He died in 1369, and was buried in the church in Boughton in Northamptonshire. At his death his possessions descended on his two sons Henry and Thomas.

He was also General Manager of Israel Shipyards from 1986 to 1995. Early life Almog was born in Tel Aviv, Mandatory Palestine. His parents had emigrated from Poland in 1933. Almog had one younger brother, Amikam. Almog grew up and was educated in Haifa. In August 1952, he graduated from the religious High School of \\"Yavne\\" and joined the Israeli Army in the framework of Benei Akiva (a religious youth organization), the \\"Nahal\\". Almog graduated from Class Commanders and Physical Education Instructors courses and served in the infantry brigade of the Nahal. Naval service In May 1954, Almog volunteered for the Naval Commando Unit and in 1955 was certified as a Naval Commando Warrior. He was then sent to Officers and Naval Cadets Schools. In July 1957, Almog was qualified as a naval officer. In November of the same year, he was appointed as a Squad Commander within the Naval Commando Unit, and for the next five years filled active command and training roles within the Naval Commando Unit. From 1962‚Äì1965, Almog studied at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He received a BA degree in Geography and Political Science. He conducted research and delivered his final dissertation on \\"The Geomorphology of the Coast of Atlit\\". In October 1965, he was appointed Chief of Operations of the Naval Commando Unit. In December 1966 he was certified and given command of a Naval Torpedo Boat. During the Six-Day War in 1967, he was called to command a Naval Commando Team that penetrated the Egyptian port of Port Said. Commander of the Naval Commando Unit (\\"Flotilla 13\\") In May 1968, Almog was appointed as the commander of the Naval Commando Unit. During his tenure the status and functioning of the unit were dramatically transformed. Under Almog's leadership, the unit performed eighty combat operations, the majority during the War of Attrition. Among the more noteworthy operations were the raids on the Adabiya coast post, the Green Island fort (Operation Bulmus 6), as well as the sinking of two Egyptian torpedo boats in the Gulf of Suez (operation Escort), whose successful completion was the precondition for the execution of the armored raid (operation Raviv) on the Egyptian shore. Almog completed professional training courses in different naval units and was certified as a missile boat commander. Commander of the Red Sea Arena In July 1972, Almog was appointed as the Commander of the Red Sea Arena at the rank of captain. He commanded the combat operations of this arena during the Yom Kippur War (1973) which resulted in the incapacitation the Egyptian navy in the Gulf of Suez along with the destruction and capture of 28 Egyptian vessels. During the Yom Kippur War, Almog joined the fourth raid into the Egyptian port of Hurgada, in the northern part of the Red Sea. During this raid an Egyptian Missile boat was sunk using anti-tank M72 LAW missiles. In addition, Almog participated in mortar shelling launched from a landing craft on the Egyptian anchorage of Marsa T'lamat (Central Gulf of Suez). Under Almog's command, the new Naval base at Sharm el-Sheikh was built. This base absorbed the first two Israeli- made Sa'ar 4 class missile boats that reached the base after sailing around Africa (due to the blockage of the Suez Canal). In 1972, Almog studied at the US Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island and received a Masters degree in Management and Strategy. In August 1975 he was appointed as the commander of the Naval Base of Haifa and was promoted to one-star Rear Admiral. In November 1976 he was appointed as a member of the founding team of the Israeli National Defense College and served as an instructor in the college during its first year of operation. Commander of the Israeli Navy In January 1979, following the dismissal of Michael Barkai due to sexual misconduct, Almog was appointed as the Commander In Chief (C.I.C.) of the Israeli Navy and was promoted to the rank of two star Rear Admiral. He served in this position until February 1985 (longer than any other Commander In Chief of the Israeli Navy). Following are some of the noteworthy milestones from this period in his career: ;Restructuring of the navy's organizational structure Israel's naval territory was organized and divided into three naval arenas: Haifa, Ashdod, and the Red Sea. The commanders of these arenas were assigned with full responsibility for the territory and forces under their command and their authority was expanded. ;Improvement in Israel's seashore security After a decade of lethal terrorist penetrations into Israel, under Almog's command, was able to completely eliminate penetration of terrorists from the Mediterranean and Red seas. This was achieved as a result of an execution of new plan that combined both defensive and offensive actions. During this period, the navy had conducted hundreds of combat intrusions into terrorist bases. In 1982, it participated in the First Lebanon War during which ground forces and thousands of armored vehicles were landed on the Lebanese seashore. The navy had also assisted ground forces by firing at the enemy forces from missile boats off the shores of Lebanon. All Naval operations were conducted without any loss of Israeli lives or damage to naval vessels. ;Peace treaty with Egypt Israel naval bases in the Sinai Peninsula were evacuated. Israel resumed routine sailing of vessels in the Suez Canal. Visits of naval vessels and personnel between the Egyptian and the Israeli navy were conducted. Search operations for the missing submarine \\"Dakar\\" were resumed. ;Update of naval strategy A new strategy called \\"Inter-operational Naval Battle\\" was developed. Its core element included combined operation of missile boats, submarines and naval commandos. The new strategy was ratified by the military Chief of Staff. ;Design of future combat equipment The Israeli Navy conducted extensive planning in order to define its future needs, and the development and acquisition of equipment. This included Sa'ar 5 missile boats (\\"Lahav\\"), Dolphine submarines, anti-missile missiles (\\"Barak\\") and naval helicopters (\\"Dolphin\\" type). In addition, the Navy launched the development and the build-up of a sophisticated system of alert and surveillance along the shores of Israel. ;The Absorption of new vessels and systems Missile boats Sa'ar 4 type (\\"Nadran\\"), missile boats Sa'ar 4.5 type (\\"Noshav\\"), hydrofoil missile boats (\\"Zivanit\\"), anti-missile cannons (\\"Vulcan Phalanx\\"), Encapsulated Harpoon missiles launched from \\"Gal\\" submarines, new boats for the naval commandos, and new electronic and other systems for most naval boats. ;Training re-organization Training methods for officers and sailors were formulated. A new procedure by which vessel commanders are certified was defined. Career paths for officers ranking from Ensign to Commander were constructed and included academic studies. ;Bringing of Ethiopian Jews to Israel In the period preceding the Operation Moses, the first 1,000 Ethiopian Jews were brought from the shores of Sudan to Israel, under a covert operation. General Manager ‚Äì Israel Shipyards In March 1986, Almog retired from the IDF and was appointed, at the request of the Ministers of Transportation and Finance and the Official Receiver of the state as a \\"Special Manager\\" for the government-owned Israel Shipyards. This appointment stemmed from the serious situation of the shipyards that were on a verge of bankruptcy and needed a turnaround. Nine years later, after completion of a turnaround program the company became profitable, was taken out of receivership and was sold as a viable business to private investors. During Almog's tenure as the General Manager of the shipyards it developed two types of sophisticated vessels: Sa'ar 4.5 missile boat (\\"Nirit\\" type) and the fast patrol boat (\\"Shaldag\\") that was purchased by the Israeli Navy and other foreign navies.HighBeam During this time the American Navy's Sixth Fleet conducted 50% of its Mediterranean ship repairs in Israel Shipyards. It has invested significant funding in dredging the shipyard harbor and improving other infrastructure facilities at the shipyards. In April 1995, after the privatization of the shipyards, Almog resigned from the shipyards management and devoted his time to serving on various organizations and companies' board of directors such as Israel-Africa Investment Company and was elected to the Israeli Management Society. he was elected as a member of the Board of Trustees of the University of Haifa and as a member of the steering committee of the Institutes for Oceanic Studies at Haifa University. Heserved as the chairman of the Israeli national fund for the development of scuba diving. Special awards Almog received the Legion of Merit award from the United States Secretary of Defense while commanding the Israeli Navy (1981). Almog was selected by the World Board of Governors of the U.S.O (a US government organization responsible for personal wellbeing of the US military around the world) to become the first U.S.O president in Israel (1992). He published several articles in Israeli and foreign publications on topics of military operations and management and had lectured at military academies and research centers in Israel and abroad about naval operations and technology. He published a book called \\"Bats in the Red Sea - special operations of naval commandos in the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War\\" (Ministry of Defense Publications and Galilee Research Center for the Defense Force, 2007). Family Ze'ev Almog is married to Dr. Geula Almog, a children's literature expert. The couple has three children: Gal, Oz, and Ram. His brother Amikam married Ita Almog and together they had two children: Tal and Daniel. Tal married Emily Almog and they had three daughters: Abigail, Naomi, and Elizabeth.

The series aired on CBS from September 10, 1990 to March 9, 1991 during the 1990‚Äì91 season. Synopsis Kevin Meaney starred as Buck, a slob who drinks, smokes and is named the guardian of his nieces, Tia and Maizy, and nephew, Miles, after their parents, Bob (Buck's brother) and Cindy (Buck's sister-in-law), are suddenly killed in a car accident. Critical reception The show was panned by critics. After airing on Monday nights for two months, it was moved to Friday, in an attempt by CBS to establish a comedy night swapping with Evening Shade. The ratings dropped from there with strong competition from ABC's Top 20 hit Full House, and it was cancelled shortly after, having aired only 16 episodes and leaving several filmed episodes unaired.

This graph assumes that all bioethanols are burnt in their country of origin and that previously existing cropland is used to grow the feedstock. No indirect land use changes are included. Biodiesel sample The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) in the United Kingdom is a requirement on transport fuel suppliers to ensure that 5 percent of all road vehicle fuel is supplied from sustainable renewable sources by 2010. The Government intends to set variable targets for the level of carbon and sustainability performance expected from all transport fuel suppliers claiming certificates for biofuels in the early years of the RTFO. The announcement to introduce the Obligation was made on 10 November 2005,http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=177217&NewsAreaID;=2 using powers included in the Energy Act 2004. It came into force on 15 April 2008.http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20073072_en_2#pt2 In mid-2005, biofuel made up 0.25% of overall road fuel sales, around 50% of it imported.http://www.biodiesel.co.uk/biofuels_breakthrough.htm In practice, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will mostly be achieved by blending fossil fuels with bioethanol, biomethanol or biodiesel - derived from sources such as palm oil, oilseed rape, cereals, sugar cane, sugar beet, and reprocessed vegetable oil - or biomethane. Almost all existing vehicles are able to run on a 5% blend in liquid fuels, in some cases with fuel system adjustments. Natural gas vehicles can run on pure biomethane. Consideration should also be given to the effect of biofuel constituents on fuel system parts such as rubber hoses, particularly in older or classic vehicles. Flexible Fuel Vehicles, currently more common in the Americas than in Europe, are able to use blends of up to 85% ethanol in the U.S. and Canada, and up to 100% hydrous ethanol in Brazil. The requirement that the biofuel sources should be sustainable is also important. In South America and Asia, the production of biofuels for export has in some cases resulted in significant ecological damage, including the clearing of rainforest. In the future, the Department for Transport estimate that up to 1/3 of the fuel in the UK transport sector could be produced from home-grown biofuels. In addition to contributing to cutting carbon emissions, the use of biofuels is seen as widening the country's fuel diversity and increasing fuel security. The RTFO will help bring the UK into line with European Union biofuels directive, which sets targets for all EU countries for biofuel usage of 2% by the end of 2005 and 5.75% by the end of 2010. Implementation The RTFO will be implemented through a certification scheme administered by the Department for Transport. Companies certified as having sold more than the 5% obligation will be able to sell their certificates for the excess to those who sold less.

It was originally named Les Sectateurs de M√©n√®s () after the Egyptian pharaoh Menes, but changed its name in 1853. Among its members were Charles Bradlaugh and fellow freethinker Austin Holyoake. It was associated with the Conseil Supr√™me de l‚ÄôOrdre Maconnique de Memphis, a Masonic order, and the Rite of Memphis. The Grand Lodge of England opposed the Philadelphes, as it counted a number of atheists among its members and did not mandate religious observance. It became a centre for conspiratorial revolutionary activity. It had seemingly close ties with French revolutionary Charles Nodier (presumed grand master of the prieure de' sion at the period.) Nodier even spoke of the secret society after he published his book on the subject in 1822. In the beginning it was made up mainly of French √©migr√©s. From 1852 onwards, it had close ties with the political group La Commune R√©volutionnaire, which it appears to have founded, as all of the prominent members of one organization were members of the other. Although some associates of Blanqui were involved, such as Jean Baptiste Roug√© and Theophile Thor√©, they did not play a prominent role. This was taken rather by Montagnards or Jacobins, most of them with a long track record of conspiratorial politics. Aside from La Commune R√©volutionnaire, they also founded the \\"International Association\\", which existed from 1855 to 1859. Its principal tasks, as set out in its constitution, consisted of spreading the doctrine of solidarity and preparing to implement \\"the ideal of our hearts, the Universal Democratic and Social Republic\\". However, despite trying to develop ties with English Chartists, it remained an organisation of √©migr√©s in England and America. Although it has been claimed that this was the first form of international proletarianism, it remained a conspiratorial group more like Mazzini's Young Europe. They were also supporters of individual acts of terror. Following Felice Orsini's attempt on Napoleon III's life, the British government tried to put Simon Fran√ßois Bernard, another √©migr√©, on trial. The Philadelphians defended both Bernard's actions and the assassination of tyrants. Indeed Adolphe Talandier, Gustave Jourdain, Joseph Holyoake and F√©lix Pyat (all Philadelphians) were the only people who spoke at his funeral a few years later. They also laid on a banquet (under the name of the Lodge) for Paolo Tibaldi when he arrived in London after serving a prison sentence for an attempt on the life of Napoeon III. Louis Blanc, Talandier and Gustave Flourens (another Philadelphian) spoke on this occasion. The Philadlphians recruited principally amongst revolutionary socialists, but gained few recruits in Italian √©migr√© circles because of their sharp criticisms of Mazzini. Hence the lack of Italians in the International Association. This however changed in 1858-9 as the war between Piedmont and Austria started to brew. Despite the publication of a Manifesto criticising Mazzini for his anti- socialist stance emanating from the International Association, it was not signed by any of the leaders of La Commune R√©volutionnaire or the Philadelphians. Evidence in the Vienna Staatsarchiv shows that there was a faction fight, and that the Philadelphians were opting for a rapprochment with Mazzini. Napoleon III's support for Piedmont facilitated Garibaldi's victories, even if they did not indicate a leftward political trajectory on behalf of the emperor. Following his campaign in Italy, Garibaldi set up the International Legion, led by Ludwik Mieroslawski, and from 1859 to 1864 the Philadelphians concentrated on giving him support. According to La monde ma√ßonnique (1874) Garibaldi, Mazzini, Charles Bradlaugh and Louis Blanc were all members of the London Lodge of the United Philadelphians\\". A bloc was formed by the largely French Philadelphians with Garibaldi and his Italian followers. Soon their ranks were swelled by Belgians and Swiss, who then set about organising a new international organisation to replace the International Association. In 1863 Johan Philip-Becker sent out an invitation to a Congress of democratic and republican movements from all the countries of Western Europe. The Congress was held in Brussels in September 1863, prersided over by Pierre Coulery from La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland. It issued a resolution to create an Association F√©d√©rative Universelle de la D√©mocratie. However this was eclipsed by Garibaldi's trip to London and the attempt to agitate among workers groups and democratric organisations. The Philadelphians were very active in organising a reception for Garibaldi in London, setting up a special society called La France Libre. Official negotiations with government circles collapsed, but the Philadelphians played a major role in linking up with grassroots organisations. During this agitation they dropped the phrase \\"R√©publique D√©mocratique et Sociale Universelle\\", and socialist agitation took second place behind developing stronger relations between French and Italian democrats. No mention was made of Garibaldi's 1860 promise that the International Legion would carry the struggle to their own countries once Italy was liberated. However, the Philadelphians were moving towards mass politics and away from trying to influence government circles, particularly amongst their Belgian and Swiss allies, who had born the brunt of the organising the 1863 Congress in Belgium. Whether the Order of Memphis had set up groups in Geneva and Brussels remains unclear. At this time members of groups of Parisian workers visited London to acquaint themselves with the English Labour Movement. Their approach was much more open and popular than the clandestine methods which the Order of Memphis had preserved from earlier generations. Yet the Philadelphes made a significant contribution to the setting up of the International Workingmen's Association. The Rite flourished in England from about 1850 with numerous French language lodges. Many ardent republicans became involved (Louis Blanc, Alfred Talandier, Charles Longuet and Giuseppe Garibaldi (honorary member)). In 1871, the fall of the Paris Commune contributed to a decrease in Lodges which continued in 1880 following amnesty offered by the new French Republican government. In Egypt, the Rite developed quickly under the direction of Brother Solutore Avventure Zola, Grand Hierophant from 1873 until the reign of King Farouk. Jacques √âtienne Marconis de N√®gre implanted the Rite in America around 1856. This was developed under the energetic Grand Mastery of Harry Seymour in 1861. In 1881 the two Rites were fused, effective as of 1889. From this moment, the Rite of Memphis-Misraim spread across the world. Constituted by Marconis de N√®gre in 1838, the Rite of Memphis is a variant of the Rite of Misra√Øm. It takes the Egypto - alchemical mythology and completes it with pieces borrowed from the Templars and chivalry. The Rite of Memphis attracted personalities in quest of an ideal. It knew a certain success among military Lodges until 1841; the date where it was put to sleep. But, with the dismissal of Louis - Philippe in 1848, the Rite was reactivated. In England, from about 1850 numerous English Lodges worked the Rite of Memphis in French. They maintained celebrity for having welcomed ardent Republicans (Louis Blanc, Alfred Talandier, Charles Longuet and Giuseppe Garibaldi, (honorary member)). In 1871, the fall of the Paris Commune contributed to a decrease in Lodges that further declined around 1880 following the declaration of amnesty of the new French republican government.

He quelled local uprisings in Guangdong and Guizhou. As commander in chief in the Battle of Noryang, he also led the Ming navy to win the Imjin War, defend Joseon Korea, and defeat the invading Japanese (led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi). He then became the founder of one of the Korean Jin Clans (Gwangdong Jin clan). Chen Lin is considered a hero in both Korea and China for helping win the Imjin war and defeating the Japanese. Today his descendants are spread across South China and Korea.  Career  Chen Lin was a native of Wengyuan County, Shaoguan, Guangdong province.  Guangdong  He quelled the 1562 uprisings in Chaozhou and Yingde in Guangdong and was subsequently promoted to the Shoubei of Guangdong. Chen participated in various campaigns in Southern China against rebels and peasant uprisings thereafter. In May of the 40th year of the Wanli Emperor, the Ming court awarded Chen as tutor to the crown prince (Â§™Â≠êÂ§™‰øù) and allowed it to be hereditary.

The aid was in response to a request by the Joseon Dynasty. Chen and Yi both fought in the Battle of Noryang, which ended Hideyoshi's attempts to invade Korea. See details in Imjin War section below.  Guizhou and Miao  After campaigning in Korea, Chen was promoted and gained control of troops in Hunan and Guangdong. He led troops to quell the Miao (Hmong) uprising in Zunyi, Guizhou province. He also helped quell the Bozhou rebellion.

He is the son and namesake of Scotland and Middlesbrough footballer Bobby Baxter. Career Baxter began his career by signing a professional contract on joining Darlington in November 1959. He began his professional career as a forward and was Darlington's top scorer for two seasons. After playing 64 league games and scoring 30 times he moved to Brighton & Hove Albion in June 1961 with Dennis Windross moving in the opposite direction. He had to wait until 25 November that year for his Brighton debut, at the Goldstone Ground against Preston North End. At Brighton he was converted to a wing half or full-back, and eventually made 195 league appearances, scoring six times, before moving to Torquay United in July 1967. He immediately settled into the Torquay first team at the start of the season, but lost his place when Bill Kitchener was signed on loan from West Ham United. Early in the following season, Kitchener signed permanently for Torquay and Baxter again lost his place. However, Baxter regained his place in the first team when Kitchener was switched to the centre of defence after the career-ending injury received by Torquay defender Alan Smith. After appearing in 62 league games (scoring six goals) for the Gulls, Baxter returned to Darlington in July 1969, playing just one further season in the football league before joining non-league Plymouth City in July 1970. In September 2001, Baxter, still a Torbay resident, returned to Plainmoor as a match summariser for BBC Radio for the game between Torquay and Scunthorpe United.

Common aggregate functions include: * Average (i.e., arithmetic mean) * Count * Maximum * Median * Minimum * Mode * Range * Sum Others include: * Nanmean (mean ignoring NaN values, also known as \\"nil\\" or \\"null\\") * Stddev Formally, an aggregate function takes as input a set, a multiset (bag), or a list from some input domain and outputs an element of an output domain . The input and output domains may be the same, such as for \`SUM\`, or may be different, such as for \`COUNT\`. Aggregate functions occur commonly in numerous programming languages, in spreadsheets, and in relational algebra. The \`listagg\` function, as defined in the SQL:2016 standard aggregates data from multiple rows into a single concatenated string.  Decomposable aggregate functions  Aggregate functions present a bottleneck, because they potentially require having all input values at once. In distributed computing, it is desirable to divide such computations into smaller pieces, and distribute the work, usually computing in parallel, via a divide and conquer algorithm. Some aggregate functions can be computed by computing the aggregate for subsets, and then aggregating these aggregates; examples include \`COUNT, MAX, MIN,\` and \`SUM\`. In other cases the aggregate can be computed by computing auxiliary numbers for subsets, aggregating these auxiliary numbers, and finally computing the overall number at the end; examples include \`AVERAGE\` (tracking sum and count, dividing at the end) and \`RANGE\` (tracking max and min, subtracting at the end). In other cases the aggregate cannot be computed without analyzing the entire set at once, though in some cases approximations can be distributed; examples include \`DISTINCT COUNT, MEDIAN,\` and \`MODE\`. Such functions are called decomposable aggregation functions or decomposable aggregate functions. The simplest may be referred to as self-decomposable aggregation functions, which are defined as those functions such that there is a merge operator such that :f(X \\\\uplus Y) = f(X) \\\\diamond f(Y) where is the union of multisets (see monoid homomorphism). For example, \`SUM\`: :\\\\operatorname{SUM}({x}) = x, for a singleton; :\\\\operatorname{SUM}(X \\\\uplus Y) = \\\\operatorname{SUM}(X) + \\\\operatorname{SUM}(Y), meaning that merge is simply addition. \`COUNT\`: :\\\\operatorname{COUNT}({x}) = 1, :\\\\operatorname{COUNT}(X \\\\uplus Y) = \\\\operatorname{COUNT}(X) + \\\\operatorname{COUNT}(Y). \`MAX\`: :\\\\operatorname{MAX}({x}) = x, :\\\\operatorname{MAX}(X \\\\uplus Y) = \\\\max\\\\bigl(\\\\operatorname{MAX}(X), \\\\operatorname{MAX}(Y)\\\\bigr). \`MIN\`: :\\\\operatorname{MIN}({x}) = x, :\\\\operatorname{MIN}(X \\\\uplus Y) = \\\\min\\\\bigl(\\\\operatorname{MIN}(X), \\\\operatorname{MIN}(Y)\\\\bigr). Note that self- decomposable aggregation functions can be combined (formally, taking the product) by applying them separately, so for instance one can compute both the \`SUM\` and \`COUNT\` at the same time, by tracking two numbers. More generally, one can define a decomposable aggregation function as one that can be expressed as the composition of a final function and a self-decomposable aggregation function , f = g \\\\circ h, f(X) = g(h(X)). For example, \`AVERAGE\`=\`SUM\`/\`COUNT\` and \`RANGE\`=\`MAX\`‚àí\`MIN\`. In the MapReduce framework, these steps are known as InitialReduce (value on individual record/singleton set), Combine (binary merge on two aggregations), and FinalReduce (final function on auxiliary values), and moving decomposable aggregation before the Shuffle phase is known as an InitialReduce step, Decomposable aggregation functions are important in online analytical processing (OLAP), as they allow aggregation queries to be computed on the pre-computed results in the OLAP cube, rather than on the base data. For example, it is easy to support \`COUNT, MAX, MIN,\` and \`SUM\` in OLAP, since these can be computed for each cell of the OLAP cube and then summarized (\\"rolled up\\"), but it is difficult to support \`MEDIAN\`, as that must be computed for every view separately.  Other decomposable aggregate functions  In order to calculate the average and standard deviation from aggregate data, it is necessary to have available for each group: the total of values (Œ£xi = SUM(x)), the number of values (N=COUNT(x)) and the total of squares of the values (Œ£xi2=SUM(x2)) of each groups.Ing. √ìscar Bonilla, MBA \`AVG\`: :\\\\operatorname{AVG}(X \\\\uplus Y) = \\\\bigl(\\\\operatorname{AVG}(X) * \\\\operatorname{COUNT}(X) + \\\\operatorname{AVG}(Y) * \\\\operatorname{COUNT}(Y)\\\\bigr) / \\\\bigl(\\\\operatorname{COUNT}(X) + \\\\operatorname{COUNT}(Y)\\\\bigr). or :\\\\operatorname{AVG}(X \\\\uplus Y) = \\\\bigl(\\\\operatorname{SUM}(X) + \\\\operatorname{SUM}(Y)\\\\bigr) / \\\\bigl(\\\\operatorname{COUNT}(X) + \\\\operatorname{COUNT}(Y)\\\\bigr). or, only if COUNT(X)=COUNT(Y) :\\\\operatorname{AVG}(X \\\\uplus Y) = \\\\bigl(\\\\operatorname{AVG}(X) + \\\\operatorname{AVG}(Y)\\\\bigr) / 2. \`SUM(x2)\`: The sum of squares of the values is important in order to calculate the Standard Deviation of groups : \\\\operatorname{SUM}(X^2 \\\\uplus Y^2) = \\\\operatorname{SUM}(X^2)+\\\\operatorname{SUM}(Y^2) \`STDDEV\`: For a finite population with equal probabilities at all points, we haveStandard deviation#Identities and mathematical properties : \\\\operatorname{STDDEV}(X) = s(x) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\\\\overline{x})^2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2\\\\right) - (\\\\overline{x})^2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{SUM}(x^2) / \\\\operatorname{COUNT}(x) - \\\\operatorname{AVG}(x) ^2} This means that the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the difference between the average of the squares of the values and the square of the average value. :\\\\operatorname{STDDEV}(X \\\\uplus Y) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{SUM}(X^2 \\\\uplus Y^2) / \\\\operatorname{COUNT}(X \\\\uplus Y) - \\\\operatorname{AVG}(X \\\\uplus Y) ^2}. :\\\\operatorname{STDDEV}(X \\\\uplus Y) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\bigl(\\\\operatorname{SUM}(X^2)+\\\\operatorname{SUM}(Y^2)\\\\bigr) / \\\\bigl(\\\\operatorname{COUNT}(X) + \\\\operatorname{COUNT}(Y) \\\\bigr) - \\\\bigl((\\\\operatorname{SUM}(X) + \\\\operatorname{SUM}(Y)) / (\\\\operatorname{COUNT}(X) + \\\\operatorname{COUNT}(Y))\\\\bigr)^2}.

Biography George Van Eps was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, into a family of musicians. His three brothers were musicians. His mother was a classical pianist and his father, Fred Van Eps, was a ragtime banjoist and sound engineer. George Van Eps began playing banjo when he was eleven years old. After hearing Eddie Lang on the radio, he put down the banjo and devoted himself to guitar. By the age of thirteen, in 1926, he was performing on the radio. Through the middle of the 1930s, he played with Harry Reser, Smith Ballew, Freddy Martin, Benny Goodman, and Ray Noble. Van Eps moved to California and spent most of his remaining career as a studio musician, playing on many commercials and movie soundtracks. In the 1930s, he invented a model of guitar with another bass string added to the common six- string guitar. The seven-string guitar allowed him to play basslines below his chord voicings, unlike the single-string style of Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt. He called his technique \\"lap piano\\". It anticipated the fingerpicking style of country guitarists Chet Atkins and Merle Travis and inspired jazz guitarists Bucky Pizzarelli, John Pizzarelli, and Howard Alden to pick up the seven-string. Dixieland had a following in Los Angeles during the 1940s and 1950s, and he played in groups led by Bob Crosby and Matty Matlock and appeared in the film \\"Pete Kelly's Blues.\\" He famously played guitar on Frank Sinatra's classic 1955 album In the Wee Small Hours. Van Eps played guitar into his 80s, having built a career that lasted over sixty years. He died of pneumonia in Newport Beach, California on November 29, 1998 at the age of 85.

It is named after French explorer Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec. The peninsula is dominated by the steep Saruwaged and Finisterre and Cromwell Mountains. The nearest large town is the Morobe provincial capital Lae to the south, while settlements on the north coast include the former German town of Finschhafen, the district capital of Wasu, Malalamai and Saidor with its World War II era Saidor Airport. The area was the site of the Huon Peninsula campaign of World War II, in 1943-44 as Japanese troops retreating from Lae fought their way over the Finisterre Mountains to Madang on the north coast. Flora and fauna The rainforests that cover these remote mountains provide habitats for many birds and animals and have been designated the Huon Peninsula Montane Rain Forests ecoregion. The rainforest of the hillsides consists of shorter trees and more herbs than you would find in lowland rainforests around the world, with predominant species of tree including Pometia, Canarium, Anisoptera, Cryptocarya laurels, and Terminalia, while the higher slopes have thicker forests of yet smaller trees and the higher slopes of the Cromwell Range in particular hold the best-preserved large forest of Dacrydium conifers in the southern hemisphere. Mammals indigenous to the Huon region include the endangered Matschie's tree-kangaroo, while the birds include many of typical Australasian families such as bowerbirds, Australian robins, honeyeaters (including the endemic spangled honeyeater) and birds of paradise (including the endemic Huon astrapia). There are also endemic butterflies. Although some logging has taken place, the forests of the Huon Peninsula mountains are mostly undisturbed.

It aims to foster an environment in which young adults can grow their worldview and expand their horizons, whilst learning about and discussing important, influential issues in our world today. By inviting a variety of different schools, with different outlooks and cultures, it creates an atmosphere in which students can learn and form opinions in a globalized setting and ultimately become better, well- rounded world citizens. The conference is held annually in the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations Headquarters. The use of the General Assembly Hall by the UNIS-UN Conference is a strong representation of the tie between the United Nations International School and the United Nations. The conference is targeted towards the international high-school students that make up the majority of its audience. The conference is run with an invitation-only policy. Each year, a new topic of interest and importance is chosen for the conference. The UNIS-UN Conference is designed to provide students with expert knowledge imparted by provocative guest speakers. The conference also endeavors to give students a platform to express and debate their own opinions and views. The conference has gained much fame over the years, and is commonly the first thing associated with the United Nations International School. More than seven hundred students hailing from six continents attend the conference. Approximately 400 of the attending students are enrolled at UNIS. An additional 300 - 400 more students are invited from international schools around the world.  History  UNIS-UN was founded in 1976 by several UNIS students in collaboration with a tutorial house (UNIS equivalent of high school) teacher. The conference was first held on March 3 and 4, 1977, in the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations Headquarters, and became a tradition every year since then. Unfortunately, the 2020 conference was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The organizing committee has grown over the years (to its current number of approximately seventy).  Organization  The 2006 UNIS-UN Conference UN General Assembly Hall Secretary General Kofi Annan and President of the General Assembly Jan Eliasson at the 2006 UNIS-UN Conference Morgan Spurlock delivering the keynote address at the 2005 UNIS-UN Conference The UNIS-UN Organizing Committee is split up into several committees (Visiting Schools, Finance and Resource, Tech, Public Information & Communications, Debate, Editing, and Speakers) to ease the organization process. Visiting Schools is in charge of organizing the students visiting from abroad. Finance and Resources buys merchandise for the attendees to buy. Technology organizes any technological feats, like presentations for the speakers. PIC/PR & Communications deals with advertising the conference throughout UNIS, and Debate sorts out the student and speaker debates. Editing edits the articles for the Working Paper, and Speakers finds people to speak at the conference. Each committee is headed by one or two students (usually juniors and seniors). These committee heads make up the UNIS-UN Executive Committee; however, there are a select few students who are not the heads of the commissions but are prominent members of the commissions.

Known as the \\"father of professional hockey\\", Gibson founded the International Professional Hockey League in 1904, the first fully professional hockey league in history. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 1976. Biography Jack Gibson was born in Berlin, Ontario, which later became Kitchener. As a youth, he excelled in academics and athletics, playing a number of sports well. Gibson received an offer to play in the developmental system of Everton Football Club. He considered the move, but decided to stay in North America to continue his studies. He graduated from Berlin High School in 1896. Gibson was a gifted hockey player who played throughout Ontario and helped the Berlin Hockey Club win the provincial intermediate championship team in 1897. Gibson and his teammates were expelled from the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) in 1898 after being accused of accepting payment. The OHA was militantly opposed to professionalism and banned the team after Berlin's mayor presented each player with a $10 gold coin in celebration of a win over the rival team from Waterloo. Gibson had offered to return the coin, to no avail. He attended Pickering College to pursue a Bachelor of Science.Biographical Publishing Company. Biographical Record: This Volume Contains Biographical Sketches of Leading Citizens of Houghton, Baraga And Marquette Counties, Michigan ... Chicago: Biographical Publishing Co., 1903. page 343 He was also a member of the Pickering football team. Later, he moved to the University of Detroit Dental School. After graduation, he moved to the northern Michigan community of Houghton to set up a dental practice. Still a gifted hockey player, he recruited other talented individuals and established the Portage Lakes Hockey Club in 1902-03. Portage Lakes was an openly professional team, and Gibson captained the squad and was its leading scorer. After defeating the Montreal Wanderers in 2 exhibition contests in the 1903 - 1904 season in front of 5,000 fans at the Houghton Amphidrome, it became obvious to Gibson that Northern Michigan was a hockey hotbed and could sustain a league and the International Professional Hockey League, the first professional hockey league in the world, opened for business in 1904. Gibson attracted the likes of Hod and Bruce Stuart, Riley Hern, and Cyclone Taylor to play in the league. In addition to Houghton Portage Lakes, the Calumet Miners, Michigan Soo Indians, the Pittsburgh Pro Hockey Club and the Canadian Soo team rounded out the league. The league folded after only three years when professional hockey became a reality in Canada in 1907 and many of the star players returned home. 15 of the 97 players who played in the IPHL from 1904 to 1907, including Gibson, are members of the Hockey Hall of Fame. After practising dentistry and refereeing local games in Houghton for a few years, Gibson also returned to Canada and set up a dental practice in Calgary, Alberta, where he resided until he died in 1954. Beginning in 1939, a trophy, named the Gibson Cup, was awarded to the champion of the Michigan-Ontario Pro Hockey League. Today, the Gibson Cup is given to the winner of an annual challenge series between the Portage Lake Pioneers and the Calumet Wolverines. The Gibson Cup is the third-oldest hockey cup in North America, behind only the Stanley Cup (1893) and the MacNaughton Cup (1913). The MacNaughton Cup goes to the regular-season champion of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association.

Together with the Riachuelo, it is one of the most contaminated watercourses in the country. The Reconquista is part of the R√≠o de la Plata basin. It originates in Marcos Paz, Buenos Aires Province, and flows across 18 municipalities, emptying into the Luj√°n River. Its drainage basin has an area of and is populated by around 4 million people. The river carries about 33 percent of the total pollution drained by the estuary of the R√≠o de la Plata, taking into account both industrial and domestic waste. There are about 12,000 industries in its basin, 700 of which dump their waste into the watercourse without controls. Studies have found nitrites, nitrates, ester-phenols, PCB, and heavy metals. These pollutants can cause hepatitis, skin reactions, gastrointestinal problems and eye infections.  History  Railway bridge over the Reconquista River in Paso del Rey. During the 1980s, there was a wave of protests by local residents denouncing the lack of state involvement. In 1984, the national Senate addressed the issue for the first time. In 1995, the national government obtained a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank for the cleaning and control of the Reconquista. The construction started in 1996, with a $400 million budget assigned to an autonomous entity called UniRec. In 2001 they were officially finished, and advertised as such, though only the flood prevention works were built. Four projected waste treatment plants and other sanitation infrastructure were not. There was also no minimization or monitoring of industrial waste dumped into the course. According to Mart√≠n Nunziata, member of a R√≠o de la Plata environmental group, this failure to comply with the plan was the result of political corruption, and also due to the pressure exerted by the polluting industries on the workers: \\"The companies warn [them] that, if the environmental laws are applied, they will have to close.\\" Nunziata also alluded to the cellulose plant conflict between Argentina and Uruguay: \\"If, starting today, it was decided to demand from the industries of the Reconquista River the same things we want Uruguay to demand from the Fray Bentos cellulose plants, out of the 12,000 companies installed, at least 10,000 would have to close down.\\"  Destroyed historic bridge  The 1773 over the Reconquista River was declared a National Historic Monument of Argentina, but in 1997, the demolished it.

The external examiner plays an important role in all degree level examinations in higher education in the United Kingdom. The external examiner system originated in 1832 with the establishment of the University of Durham, the first in England since Cambridge was founded 600 years earlier. Durham used Oxford examiners to assure the public that its degrees were a similar standard to Oxford's.Cuthbert, Mike (2003) \\"The external examiner: how did we get here? \\" Presentation to the UKCLE/ALT workshop on external examiners, 6 June 2003. Retrieved 21 May 2012. The establishment of more universities in England from the 1880s was accompanied by a requirement that examinations be conducted by internal and external examiners. It is also found in countries whose higher education systems were developed from United Kingdom practice, or strongly influenced by it, after its introduction, including New Zealand, and India. It is one of the oldest systems of quality control within higher education. It is a requirement for all degree level examinations at British universities, and in countries operating a similar system, that at least one member of the examining board should be from a university other than the one awarding the degree (and should have no recent affiliation with it). This applies both to undergraduate examinations, where there may be hundreds or even thousands of candidates, and to postgraduate examinations including those for the PhD where a special board is convened for each candidate. Role While the role of the external examiner varies with the level of examination, the purpose of the system remains the same: to ensure that standards are kept the same across universities, and to provide an assurance of fair play given that internal examiners might be prejudiced for or against a candidate. In consequence, (by convention and often by regulation) if examiners disagree, the view of the external examiner takes precedence. Undergraduate and Taught Postgraduate examinations In undergraduate and taught postgraduate examinations, external examiners typically see and have to approve draft examination questions before the papers are set; and they will review the marks and the work of at least a sample of candidates. They are often asked to adjudicate when candidates are on borderlines or when internal examiners have disagreed about a candidate's marks. Externals are expected to make a report both to the department and also to the university authorities; they have wide licence to comment on all aspects of the degree programme, including its staffing and teaching, not just on the examination process. Where viva voce examinations are still held as part of the final degree assessment, it is common for external examiners to take part in them. Students may have the right to ask for their work to be considered by the external examiner. External examiners are typically appointed for a period of three or four years, and it is common to consult them about changes to the programme that are being introduced during their period of office. In the case of examinations in broad disciplines, there are commonly several external examiners with different areas of expertise on a board of examiners. PhD examinations In PhD examinations within the British system, there are normally only two or three examiners, and the external examiner usually takes the lead in questioning the candidate in the viva voce examination which is the key stage of the assessment. In some other countries, e.g. Australia, New Zealand and India, externals commonly send their opinions by post, though there may also be a \\"local\\" external examiner who is present at the viva. Appointees Whatever the level of examination, it is normal to appoint as externals senior academics of acknowledged expertise ‚Äì though in the case of PhD exams, expertise takes priority over seniority if the two criteria cannot both be met, as is often the case with highly specialised subjects. An invitation or appointment to serve as an external examiner is therefore usually seen as something of an honour, though often an inconvenient one: although a fee is paid to external examiners, it is usually small, and a considerable amount of work is involved, often at the busiest time of the academic year. While the external examiner in the form described here (and the use of the title \\"External examiner\\") is specific to British or British- influenced higher education, the use of examiners from other universities (and often other countries) is widespread in other countries, especially for PhD examinations.

It was originally opened in 1944 and finally closed in 1967. History=USAAF use North Pickenham was constructed in 1942/1943 as an \\"A\\" class heavy bomber station. It was handed over to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Eighth Air Force in April 1944. It was assigned USAAF designation Station 143. =492nd Bombardment Group (Heavy)= The first USAAF group to use North Pickenham was the 492nd Bombardment Group (Heavy), arriving from Alamogordo AAF, New Mexico on 18 April 1944. The 492nd was assigned to the 14th Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-U\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 856th Bombardment Squadron (5Z) * 857th Bombardment Squadron (9H) * 858th Bombardment Squadron (9A) * 859th Bombardment Squadron (X4) The group flew Consolidated B-24 Liberators as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. B-24 of the 492d Bomb Group on a mission over Nazi Occupied Europe. The 492nd Bomb Group entered service in May 1944, and suffered tremendous losses in July. In the words of one veteran, \\"the whole group was wiped out.\\" In the three months it was operational it had flown a total of sixty-four missions losing fifty-one aircraft to enemy action and six by other causes. Subsequently, due to its heavy losses the organization was transferred to RAF Harrington on 5 August for special operations duty less personnel and equipment and the surviving personnel transferred to other B-24 units. =491st Bombardment Group (Heavy)= With the departure of the 492d BG, North Pickenham was assigned to the 491st Bombardment Group (Heavy), relocating from RAF Metfield in Suffolk, in August 1944. The 491st was assigned to the 14th Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-Z\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 852nd Bombardment Squadron (3Q) * 853rd Bombardment Squadron (T8) * 854th Bombardment Squadron (6X) * 855th Bombardment Squadron (V2) The group flew Consolidated B-24 Liberators as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The 491st Bomb Group, less the air echelon, was transferred without personnel and equipment to North Pickenham initially in February 1944 briefly before being transferred to RAF Metfield in March. With the withdrawal of the 492nd Bomb Group from operational missions in August the group was transferred back to North Pickenham . Upon its return, the 491st concentrated its attacks on strategic objectives in Germany, striking communications centers, oil refineries, storage depots, industrial areas, shipyards, and other targets in such places as Berlin, Hamburg, Kassel, Cologne, Gelsenkirchen, Bielefeld, Hanover, and Magdeburg; on one occasion attacked the headquarters of the German General Staff at Zossen, Germany. While on a mission to bomb an oil refinery at Misburg on 26 November 1944, the group was attacked by large numbers of enemy fighters; although about one-half of its planes were destroyed, the remainder fought off the interceptors, successfully bombed the target, and won for the group a Distinguished Unit Citation. Although engaged primarily in strategic bombardment, the group also supported ground forces at Saint-L√¥ in July 1944; assaulted V-weapon sites and communications lines in France during the summer of 1944; dropped supplies to paratroops on 18 September 1944 during the airborne attack in the Netherlands; bombed German supply lines and fortifications during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945; supported Allied forces in the airborne drop across the Rhine in March 1945; and interdicted enemy communications during the Allied drive across Germany in April 1945. The 491st Bomb Group returned to McChord AAF Washington on 17 July 1945 and was inactivated on 8 September 1945. Post-war RAF use The USAAF evacuated North Pickenham in August 1945 with the airfield becoming an RAF satellite for No. 258 Maintenance Unit RAF (MU) at RAF Shipdham. North Pickenham was transferred to RAF Bomber Command in March 1948 and became inactive on 26 October. In August 1949, the airfield was transferred back to RAF Maintenance Command and became home to No. 281 MU. On 1 December 1958 the station was reopened as the home for the newly reformed No. 220 Squadron RAF, equipped with Thor nuclear missiles; the squadron was deactivated in October 1963 and the missiles removed. North Pickenham was later used for testing the Hawker P.1127, an experimental aircraft which would later evolve into the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, and the site was finally sold in 1967 at which point the station was officially closed. Current use With the end of military control, the airfield was developed into the site of a large turkey farm with sheds built along all three runways. Later on a karting circuit was developed using part of the perimeter track and dispersal pans. Only a T2 hangar and a few bomb stores remain on the airfield site, however at some of the dispersed sites in and around North Pickenham village a few of the wartime buildings can still be found, including the headquarters block. A memorial stone in honour of the two Bomb Groups that flew from North Pickenham was dedicated during a 2d Air Division reunion in 1987. It is situated at the entrance to what was Site 4, the old mess site. On 11 November 1990 a quartz clock was presented to the villagers of North Pickenham by the 492d Bombardment Group. It hangs in the sanctuary of the parish church. A plaque in the church at Metfield was dedicated in 1992.

An underworld where the dead live in shadow is common to beliefs in the ancient Near East, in Biblical Hebrew expressed by the term tsalmaveth (◊¶÷∑◊ú◊û÷∏◊ï÷∂◊™: lit. \\"death-shadow\\", \\"shadow of death\\"; alternate term for Sheol).Gesenius(edit.)

The Witch of Endor in the First Book of Samuel notably conjures the ghost (owbGesenius) of Samuel. Only select individuals are exempt from the fate of dwelling in shadow after death, and instead ascend to the divine sphere. This is the apotheosis aspired to by kings claiming divinity, and reflected in the veneration of heroes. Plutarch relates how Alexander the Great was inconsolable after the death of Hephaistion up to the moment he received an oracle of Ammon confirming that the deceased was a hero, i.e. enjoyed the status of a divinity.\\"Alexander's grief for him exceeded all reasonable measure. He ordered the manes of all the horses and mules to be cut off in sign of mourning, he struck off the battlements of all the neighbouring cities, crucified the unhappy physician, and would not permit the flute or any other musical instrument to be played throughout his camp, until a response came from the oracle of Ammon bidding him honour Heph√¶stion and offer sacrifice to him as to a hero.\\" Parallel Lives, 72. Shades appear in Book Eleven of Homer's Odyssey, when Odysseus descends into Hades, and in Book Six of Virgil's Aeneid, when Aeneas travels to the underworld. In the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, many of the dead are similarly referred to as shades (Italian ombra), including Dante's guide, Virgil. The phrase \\"peace to thy gentle shade [and endless rest]\\" is sometimes seen in epitaphs, and was used by Alexander Pope in his epitaph for Nicholas Rowe.

Origin: 1965-68 The phrase was first used in 1965 at the annual conference of Canadian University Press in Calgary, when a delegation led by the McGill Daily proposed and passed an amendment to CUP's statement of principles that said \\"one of the major roles of the student press is to act as an agent of social change.\\" The motion's authors argued that university students, including student journalists, had a special role to play in the social and civil-rights revolutions of the time, and objective reporting could not achieve this. Instead, student journalists had to take sides on social issues, and guide campus opinion accordingly. CUP's leadership soon realized that being \\"agents of social change\\" meant that distanced, objective reporting was impossible. In 1967 CUP removed all prohibitions against \\"unbiased\\" reporting from its charter, replacing the word \\"unbiased\\" with \\"fair.\\" In 1968, CUP fleshed out the 1965 \\"agents of social change\\" clause into a longer list of resolutions, reading as follows: *that the major role of the student press is to act as an agent of social change, striving to emphasize the rights and responsibilities of the student citizen; *that the student press must in fulfilling this role perform both an educative and an active function as agents of social change; *that the student press must present local, national and international news fairly, and interpret ideas and events to the best of its ability; *that the student press must use its freedom from commercial and other controls to ensure that all it does is consistent with its major role and to examine what other media avoid. Criticism and decline: 1968-1991 \\"Agents of social change\\" and the struggle to interpret it led to frequent clashes between the radical and moderate CUP member papers. To the moderates, the phrase not only excused but encouraged biased reporting, as long as the bias was in favour of so-called progressive causes ‚Äî causes that sometimes supported violence or illegal activity. For instance, during the 1975 October Crisis, the CUP national bureau encouraged member papers to publish the FLQ manifesto and write pro-French, anti-War Measures Act articles, because they felt these perspectives were being lost in the mainstream press. In 1985, CUP wrote a list of \\"liberation organizations\\" that its national bureau was authorized to support, including the IRA and the PLO. Although member papers were not obligated to print these stories, the move alarmed and disillusioned the moderate papers, some of whom would leave CUP in the years that followed. After several inconclusive debates on the subject, CUP voted to delete the \\"agents of social change\\" clause in 1991, prompting the temporary resignation of the McGill Daily and the Simon Fraser University Peak. Even though it is no longer official CUP policy, \\"agents of social change\\" survives in the constitutions of some CUP member papers, including the Martlet at the University of Victoria, and continues to be debated at CUP conferences.

Biography Eugen Gl√ºckauf (later anglicised to Glueckauf) was born on 9 April 1906 in Eisenach, Germany, the son of Bruno Gl√ºckauf, a clothier, and Elsa Pretzfelder. At school, Gl√ºckauf was particularly adept at maths. His university training began at the University of Berlin but he switched to the Technische Hochschule at Charlottenburg, where he graduated in 1930 and, after two years‚Äô research, he gained his doctorate (Dr Ing). With the political and economic climate in Germany worsening, Gl√ºckauf left for England where, at first, life for him was not easy either. After failed first attempts, an introduction by Professor Freundlich at University College led him to Professor F. A. Paneth, who was looking for an assistant at the Royal College of Science (Imperial College). The first research problem he tackled involved analytical determination of helium in air. This involved quantitatively separating helium and neon, present in air at four times the level. This was finally solved by a twelve- stage adsorption‚Äîdesorption cascade. Paneth moved to Durham as Professor of Chemistry in 1938. Gl√ºckauf joined him, but for four months in 1940 was interned in the Isle of Man. Paneth helped secure his release, and provided him with a two-year grant from the DSIR. This enabled Gl√ºckauf to work on the ozone content in the atmosphere. In 1944 Gl√ºckauf was invited to join the Department of ‚ÄôTube Alloys‚Äô ‚Äì code for work on atomic energy ‚Äì involving the use of ion-exchange and gas chromatography to separate isotopes. In the following year he was awarded an MSc by the University of London. In addition to over 100 scholarly articles, he published Atomic Energy Waste in 1961; it became a standard reference. In addition to the topics already mentioned he contributed in the fields of radio chemistry and electrolyte solution chemistry. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1969. Family Eugen Gl√ºckauf married Irma Elise Auguste Trepper, also from Germany, in Surrey in 1934. In a Transcript of Manuscrpt Biographical Notes he recorded that ‚ÄúEarly in 1935 I sent my wife a telegram: ‚ÄòCan you learn English shorthand? You‚Äôve got three days.‚Äô She did ‚Äì just ‚Äì and after that got a part- time job as Paneth‚Äôs secretary, where she worked until 1938 when our daughter [Barbara] was born.‚Äù Glueckauf (having by now anglicised his name) was given a Certificate of Naturalization in Durham on 0n 14 May 1946; Irma received hers on the 17th.

The school was located at the corner of Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Aviation Boulevard (which runs north to the Los Angeles International Airport). Their athletic teams were known as the Falcons and the school colors were black and orange. Because of mushrooming growth in the South Bay, Los Angeles beach communities (Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, and Hermosa Beach), the school was built in 1957 (at a cost of 4 million dollars) by the then \\"South Bay Union High School District\\" which has today broken into the Redondo Beach Unified School District and the Manhattan Beach Unified School District; the district included two other high schools: Redondo Union High School and Mira Costa High School. Other proposed names for the school were Pilot George High, Will Rogers High, Kittyhawk High and‚Äîthe second runner-up‚ÄîAileen S. Hammond High. Aviation High School served students from both Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach. At its construction, Aviation's facilities‚Äîlargely single-story buildings radiating out from a central quad‚Äîwere considered \\"ultra-modern\\". In the late 1960s, a large modern auditorium was added to the campus. School closure Aviation Park sign The track and soccer field at the former Aviation High School Because of budgetary constraints in the early 1980s, in part due to California Proposition 13 (1978), the \\"South Bay Union High School District\\" decided in November 1981 to close one of its three area high schools, but promised teachers and administrators that they would not lose their jobs. Savings were projected at $1 million in maintenance costs. After much deliberation (via a 21-member citizen's committee) and several public forums, the district decided in April 1982 to close Aviation. Many in the South Bay community saw this decision as unsound (closure would result in overcrowding of the two remaining schools and would not be a viable long-term strategy if district enrollment increased; in addition, Aviation had the newest facilities of the three area high schools. Some saw the decision as based on area politics and geography (Redondo and Mira Costa High Schools were more centrally located and better anchored to their historic communities); some accused the decision of being in part motivated by the prospect of selling or leasing the facilities to Aviation High School's large corporate neighbor, the defense and credit-reporting company TRW. For some time after the school's closure, TRW did lease part of the facilities, including the gym, the track and field, and the auditorium. Although, the city still maintained the facilities. In 1983, Aviation's non-graduating students were sent to Redondo Union High School and Mira Costa High School, depending on their residence location (to avoid overcrowding at Redondo High School, Mira Costa High School's resident limits were extended outside of Manhattan beach to incorporate part of Redondo Beach). Classrooms of the campus were demolished in 1982, but the theater, gymnasium and track and field were maintained. The site of the campus is now the \\"Aviation Park\\", home to the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center (with a 1457-seat theater, recently renovated), the Aviation Gymnasium (including a 12,000 sq ft (1,100 m¬≤). and 6,300 sq ft (590 m¬≤). gyms and a 1,221 sq ft (113 m¬≤) dance room) and the Aviation Track & Field, where an artificial grass soccer field is now surrounded by a 440-yard, five-lane, all weather running track using the original curb. In 2014, a mural depicting the school's mascot was erected in the remaining Aviation Gymnasium.

Biography=Early life Cecil Harmsworth King was born on 20 February 1901 at Poynters Hall, Totteridge, Hertfordshire, the home of his grandmother, Geraldine Mary Harmsworth. He came on his father's side from a Protestant Irish family, and was brought up in Ireland. His father was Sir Lucas White King, Professor of Oriental Languages at Trinity College, Dublin, and his mother was Geraldine Adelaide Hamilton (n√©e Harmsworth), daughter of Alfred Harmsworth, a barrister, and sister of the mass-circulation newspaper proprietors Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe and Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere. The fourth child in a family of three sons and three daughters, he was educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford. According to Geoffrey Goodman: \\"He believed he was born to rule, an image of himself which never departed.\\"Geoffrey Goodman \\"The two men who gave news to the proletariat\\", Camden New Journal, 4 November 2004. Career In 1937, he was an advertising director of one of his uncle's newspapers when he formed a partnership with journalist Hugh Cudlipp. When he was made a senior director, he chose Cudlipp as his new editor. At the age of 23, Cudlipp became the youngest chief editor in Fleet Street. Between them, both men turned the Daily Mirror into the world's largest selling daily paper. In 1967, the Daily Mirror reached a world record circulation of 5,282,137 copies.Edwards, 2013. By 1963 King was chairman of the International Publishing Corporation (IPC), then the biggest publishing empire in the world, which included the Daily Mirror and some two hundred other papers and magazines (1963‚Äì1968). His influence in British public life was enormous. He himself believed that criticism of Winston Churchill's government by the Mirror had caused that government's collapse after the war.Howard Cox, and Simon Mowatt. \\"Monopoly, Power and Politics in Fleet Street: the Controversial Birth of IPC Magazines, 1958‚Äì63.\\" Business and Economic History On-line 12 (2014): 1‚Äì14. online King was involved in, and may have instigated, a 1968 meeting with Louis Mountbatten, among others, in which he proposed that Harold Wilson's government be overthrown and replaced with a temporary administration headed by Mountbatten. He had no support from them for this, so he decided to override the editorial independence of the Mirror and wrote and instructed to be published a front-page article calling on Wilson to be removed by some sort of extra-parliamentary action. The board of IPC met and demanded his resignation for this breach of procedure and for damaging the interests of IPC as a public company. He refused, and was dismissed by the board on 30 May, leaving command to Sydney Charles Burt who later expanded IPC's business in the United States. Personal life and death He married firstly Agnes Margaret Cooke, daughter of Canon George Albert Cooke and Frances Helen Anderson, in 1923. They had four children: Michael, Francis, Priscilla and Colin. He and Agnes Margaret Cooke were divorced. He married secondly Dame Ruth Railton in 1962, founder of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, daughter of Rev David Railton and Ruby Marion Wilson.Beavan, 2004. In 1974, King moved from London to Dublin with his second wife. He died at his Dublin home, The Pavilion, 23 Greenfield Park, Donnybrook, following a long illness. He was survived by Dame Ruth as well as two children from his first marriage, his sons Michael and Colin having predeceased him.

Born in 1555, he was taken to Burma as a child hostage; there he became acquainted with sword fighting and became a threat to the Burmese empire The film begins in 1564, during the Burmese siege of Phitsanulok, the center of the languishing Sukhothai kingdom. Naresuan's father, Maha Thammarachathirat, admits defeat and follows Burmese orders that his two sons, Naresuan (nicknamed Ong Dam Black Prince) and Ekathotsarot (the White Prince), be taken hostage and be raised in Pegu (the center of the Hanthawadi kingdom) under the watchful eyes of Bayinnaung, the Burmese king, who promises to care for Naresuan like one of his own. This creates a rift between Naresuan's father and his mother, Queen Wisutkasat, whose brother is the king of the neighboring Ayutthaya kingdom, as Phitsanulok is now a Burmese vassal state. Ayutthaya falls soon after. Immediately after entering the Burmese palace, Naresuan sees the palace politics and rivalries between himself and Bayinnaung's grandson, Mingyi Swa. Naresuan is sent to be educated as a novice monk, by an ethnic Mon Buddhist monk named Khanchong, at a Buddhist monastery outside the palace. There, while wandering the Thai village outside Pegu (made up of Thais displaced by Bayinnaung's expansionist campaigns and subsequent forced relocations to Hanthawadi), he befriends a Mon street child who is later allowed to work as a temple boy called Bunthing (later became Mon leader Lord Rachamanu). He also befriends Maneechan, a temple girl at the monastery. The monk Khanchong, who had also trained Bayinnaung, teaches Naresuan the skills of war and ethics. Part II: Reclaiming Sovereignty Bayinnaung dies in the beginning of the film from natural causes. Thammaracha, the governor-king of Ayutthaya, believes it is important that he go and pay respect to the dead king out of fear that the new Burmese king Nanda would deem it as an insult and attack Ayutthaya. Prince Naresuan, however, having been raised in Pegu (the kingdom of Hanthawadi) and who regards Bayinnaung as a second father, convinces Thammaracha to let him go in his place. Upon arriving in Hanthawadi (Hongsawadi in Thai), Naresuan's childhood teacher, a Buddhist monk named Khan Chong, informs him about the dangers that king Nanda and many factions in Burma are plotting his assassination. At king Bayinnaung's funeral, all representatives from vassal kingdoms are present besides for one, the Krang kingdom. King Nanda sees it as disrespect and seizes the opportunity to wage war and siege the mountain top city. Naresuan's Ayutthaya army is successful in taking the mountain top city and proves itself superior to the rival Burmese armies, namely of the Lord of Pyay and of Mingyi Swa (the eldest son of Nandabayin). Burmese rivals felt even more threatened by the strength and wits of Naresuan's army. During the battle, Naresuan's friend, Bunthing, now a highly skilled general under Naresuan, falls for the princess of Krang, who becomes his companion. A plot is uncovered by Naresuan's childhood friends, two Mon rulers, that the Burmese are in fact planning the assassination of Naresuan. Upon finding out, Naresuan executes the plotters and ceremoniously declares Ayutthaya free and sovereign from Hanthawadi. King Nanda and his Burmese are furious and begin a military campaign to capture and kill king Naresuan before his forces and liberated Siamese subjects can reach the Sittaung River. King Naresuan uses the strategy of a fighting retreat. His forces built a wooden bridge across the river and engage the pursuing Burmese army as they follow. Several battles took place during the crossing. However, as the Burmese forces catch up, the Siamese citizens and forces have already crossed to the other bank. The Burmese, determined to defeat the Siamese, try to pursue Naresuan's forces by crossing the river. The king is then approached by his revered Buddhist teacher, Mon monk Khanchong. Here, he is given a special musket, which is capable of firing across the river. According to history, the movie portrays king Naresuan firing the musket across the Sittaung River, and with one strike, killing the general of the Burmese army. With the general dead, Burmese forces retreated back to Hanthawadi. King Naresuan and his now independent Siamese forces head back to Ayutthaya and the king declares ; \\"It's not over yet, there is more work for us to do!\\" Part III: Naval Battle In 1584 at Kraeng, King Naresuan continues the war for independence of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya (Thai : ‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏ì‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏ò‡∏¢‡∏≤). The war began because King Nanda bayin king of the Burmese Kingdom (Thai : ‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏ì‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏û‡∏°‡πà‡∏≤) had secretly determined to fight a war by sending two armies to attack King Naresuan. The first army is that of Lord Pathein which passes through the Three Pagodas Pass (Thai: ‡∏î‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏¢‡πå‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå). The second army is that of the King Noratra Mangsosri (Thai : ‡∏ô‡∏£‡∏ò‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏á‡∏™‡∏≠) of Lanna (Chiang Mai) which attacks from the north of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. The Lanna army halts and builds a camp at BanSraKet (Thai : ‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏®). While two armies are preparing for continuing the war with Ayutthaya, the King of Lovek (Thai : ‡∏•‡∏∞‡πÅ‡∏ß‡∏Å) sends Lord Jinjantu (Thai : ‡∏à‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏∏), a Chinese official, to spy in Ayutthaya, but a short time later, he heads back to Lovek because king Naresuan knows that he is a spy. After an intense river battle between Jinjantu's Chinese troops and the Siamese gunboats under Naresuan's personal command, he is able to escape. When the King of Lovek learns about the skills and abilities of Naresuan, he decides to make an alliance with Ayutthaya by sending his reluctant brother, Prince Srisuphanrachathirat (Thai: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏û‡∏£‡∏£‡∏ì‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ò‡∏¥‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä) to help Ayutthaya fight against Hanthawadi (Thai : ‡∏´‡∏á‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏î‡∏µ). While Naresuan prepares for the war, he realizes that the soldiers in the army of Ayutthaya are outnumbered by the two armies of Burma, so he decides to fight with each army separately before the two armies come together. First he fights with army of Lord Pathein west of Ayutthaya and he wins this first battle. Then he fights with the army north of Ayutthaya. After a hard-fought battle, King Naresun defeats the army of King Norata Mangsosri of Lanna. After King Nanda Bayin finish the war with Inn Wa (Thai : ‡∏≠‡∏±‡∏á‡∏ß‡∏∞), he back to war with Ayuthaya. Finally, King Naresuan can keep the independence of Ayuthaya.mmushrm,2011,King Naresuan: Part Three,imdb [Online] Available : https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1878964/reviews-1 [3 December 2013].

HRH on Dlamini's father was a sadness with the realization that the fate of the daughter and invading the Ayutthaya done it, because he defected to the enemy side. Maha Thammaracha will finally, to be succeeded by King Naresuan. News of Naresuan's ascension to the throne reached Pegu. Nanda Bayin sent his son Mingyi Swa with an army to attack Ayutthaya. Naresuan planned the battle with his generals and came up with a decision to fight at Nong Sarai. The larger Burmese force under Mingy Swa was faced with a smaller army by King Naresuan. Naresuan calls Mingyi Swa for an elephant duel. Fearing humiliation of his royalty, he accepts the duel. Ekathosarot also duels with Chaophraya Chaiyanuphap. Naresuan and Mingyi Swa fought in the middle of an open field. Naresuan was cut in his head, but managed to continue fighting and was able to slay Mingyi Swa. Ekathosarot also slays Chaophraya Chaiyanuphap. The Burmese army soon retreats from Siam. This will be the last Burmese invasion that Nanda Bayin will have ordered. After his victory, Naresuan planned to order the execution of all his soldiers that didn't participate in the fight with him, but he was convinced by Khanchong, his childhood monk teacher to not have them executed and sent to fight Burma. Part VI: The end of Hong Sa  The king receives news that the Burmese king Nanda Bayin, enraged over the loss of his son, had ordered the deaths of most of the military leaders in his Army, on the grounds that they had 'let his son die'. There was also news that, in his rage, Nanda Bayin had also killed off Suphankalaya, Naresuan's older sister. This angers the King, and he quickly announces his intention to gather an army, capture Pegu, and burn it to the ground as revenge. Nanda Bayin was met by the viceroy of Toungoo and was requested to leave Pegu and retreat to Toungoo. The Lord of Pyay marched his army to loot the city. The city was later sacked by the Arakans. When Naresuan reached the city, he saw the once glorious city in ruins. His generals advised him that supply lines are stretched thin and he could march up to catch Nanda Bayin, but Naresuan insisted that the Siamese army can use Mawlamyine to supply. The Siamese army marched up to Toungoo. Toungoo was besieged by the Siamese army after the viceroy of Toungoo refused to hand over Nanda Bayin. Natshinnaung the prince of Toungoo didn't enjoy Nanda Bayin's presence in the city so he got into an agreement with Naresuan. He would allow Naresuan to get into the palace of Toungoo and execute Nanda Bayin. Nanda Bayin crossed the moats of the city and entered Nanda Bayin's chamber. Nanda Bayin then admits his guilt to Naresuan and shows his burnt face. Naresuan then spares Nanda Bayin and takes the Siamese army back to Ayutthaya. Natshinnaung later assassinates Nanda Bayin by poisoning him. Naresuan arrives back to Ayutthaya to tell his monk that we will retire and be a monk. His brother Ekathosarot would ascend to the throne.

Born in South Africa to wealthy English parents, he worked as a civil servant in the SA Board of Trade before moving permanently to England. He served as a backbench Member of Parliament for constituencies near Portsmouth nearly 30 years, from 1964 to 1992. He took an interest in African issues, shipping, and technology, and spoke about the dangers of global warming as early as 1989. Early and private life Lloyd was born in Durban in South Africa, the son of Walter John Lloyd and his wife, Carmen Craig Stewart Murray. Ian Lloyd's great-grandfather, Capt. Walter Lloyd (1823‚Äì1878), had emigrated from his native Wales to the British colony of Natal, as it then was, in the middle of the nineteenth century; the Lloyd family's ancestral home, Coedmore, is situated in Cardiganshire. Phillips-Evans, J. The Longcrofts: 500 Years of a British Family (Amazon, 2012), pp. 343-370 Ian Lloyd was educated at St. John's Preparatory in Johannesburg, at Michaelhouse in Natal, and at the University of Witwatersrand. In the Second World War, he served in the South African Air Force as a Spitfire pilot and then flying instructor. After the War, he attended King's College, Cambridge. He was President of the Cambridge Union in 1947, served with the RAFVR, and sailed and skied for the university. He graduated with an MSc in 1952, and studied at the Administrative College at Henley-on-Thames. He married Frances Addison in 1951, who survived him. They had three sons together. He returned to South Africa, where he joined the Torch Commando protest group of World War II veterans, and the United Party. He became the economic adviser at the Central Mining and Investment Corporation, part of the South African Board of Trade and Industries. He resigned and permanently left South Africa in 1955, driven away by his disagreement with the policy of apartheid. Returning to the UK, he became a shipping executive, as Director of Research at British and Commonwealth Shipping Company from 1956 to 1964. He remained its economic adviser until 1983. Political career He was selected for the safe seat of Portsmouth Langstone in 1962, and duly elected as Member of Parliament at the 1964 general election. However, he was not the first member of the Lloyd family to be elected to Parliament. His great-great-uncle, Thomas Edward Lloyd (1820-1909), served as the M.P. for Cardiganshire between 1874 and 1880 as a member of the Conservative government led by Benjamin Disraeli. Ian Lloyd remained an MP until his retirement at the 1992 election, having changed constituency twice after boundary changes, to Havant and Waterloo in 1974 and to Havant in 1983. He had to fight for re-selection from 1971 to 1973, after the constituency boundaries changed, after the selection committee of his constituency party voted to deselect him. He was re-endorsed, but then his re- endorsement was challenged by Janet Fookes. He served on the Council of Europe, and on the parliamentary assembly of the Western European Union, from 1968 to 1972. In Parliament, he took a close interest in African issues, shipping, and science. He spoke against sanctions against Rhodesia after UDI, and compared Kenneth Kaunda to Hitler. He remained a critic of the apartheid in South Africa; however, he later opposed economic sanctions and the sporting boycott, arguing that closer links would be more effective in stimulating reform. As a result, he became seen as an advocate for the South African government in Westminster, being attacked as \\"Botha's mouthpiece\\". Labour MP Dave Nellist accused Lloyd of taking money from the South African government; Lloyd later admitted accepting its hospitality. He was a member of the Select committee on Technology for 10 years, and then chairman of the Select Committee on Energy for 10 years. He drove the establishment of the Parliamentary Information Technology Committee (Pitcom), and the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST). He argued for the appointment of a minister for information technology, and was one of the first to bring a microchip into the House of Commons. He supported nuclear power, and recognised the dangers of global warming as early as 1989, when he argued that \\"civilisation is clinging by our fingernails to the cliff\\". He was knighted in 1986. Outside politics He wrote a series of books on the history of Rolls Royce, published in 1978. He was also a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. In retirement, he was a member of the council of Save British Science, and a member of the Science Policy Support Group. He died in Chichester, West Sussex and is buried at Priors Dean.Geograph References *Times Guide to the House of Commons 1987 Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 30 September 2006 *Obituary, The Independent, 2 October 2006 *Obituary, The Times, 2 October 2006 *Obituary, The Guardian, 5 October 2006 1921 births 2006 deaths Alumni of King's College, Cambridge Presidents of the Cambridge Union Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies UK MPs 1964‚Äì1966 UK MPs 1966‚Äì1970 UK MPs 1970‚Äì1974 UK MPs 1974 UK MPs 1974‚Äì1979 UK MPs 1979‚Äì1983 UK MPs 1983‚Äì1987 UK MPs 1987‚Äì1992 Alumni of Michaelhouse Alumni of St John's College, Johannesburg Politicians awarded knighthoods ","title":"Ian Lloyd (politician)"},{"id":"6315220","text":"Khavda is a village in Bhuj Taluka of Kutch district of Gujarat, India.

The Siniora Plan was the unofficial name of the 7-point truce plan for the 2006 Lebanon War (the July War) that was presented by Lebanon's Prime Minister Fuad Siniora at the 15-nation conference in Rome on 27 July 2006. The Siniora Plan called for a mutual release of Lebanese and Israeli prisoners and detainees, an immediate withdrawal of the Israeli ground troops behind the Blue Line, that the disputed Shebaa Farms area would be placed under UN jurisdiction until the ownership issue had been settled, that Israel handed over all remaining maps showing their landmines in southern Lebanon, that the Lebanese army took full control over southern Lebanon, and that a strong multi-national force under the UN is given the necessary powers (including operating under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which allows the use of force) to guarantee stability and security. On 4 August, the United States and France presented a draft UN Security Council resolution attempting to resolve the conflict. Contrary to the Siniora Plan, the draft resolution did not require Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon until an international force was in place; it said that Israel needed only to cease all \\"offensive\\" military activities, while it demanded that Hezbollah cease all military activities; and it demanded that Hezbollah immediately released captured Israelis, while stating that the issue regarding captured Lebanese was to be resolved at a later stage. Lebanon's reaction to the draft was very negative. On 7 August, at an emergency meeting of the Arab League in Beirut, the Siniora Plan was further detailed, by specifying that 15,000 Lebanese Army troops would fill the void in southern Lebanon between an Israeli withdrawal and the arrival of the international force. This way, the Lebanese government hoped to dispel the claim that the Israeli forces had to remain in Lebanon until the international force had arrived, and thus make the Siniora Plan a more viable alternative to the draft UN resolution. The number of soldiers corresponded with what Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert earlier had said that the size of the international force would need to be. The Siniora Plan received the backing of the EU and the Arab League, including countries such as Syria and Jordan. It was also supported by Hezbollah, while it was disliked by Iran. Initially, Israel didn't like the Siniora Plan, but when the 15,000 Lebanese troops were added, the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called it \\"an interesting step\\". On 8 August, a delegation from the Arab League visited the United Nations to urge for changes of the draft resolution in accordance with the Siniora Plan. The Arab view caused France to change its view on the draft proposal, and a growing rift between France and the US was reported, with France threatening to put forward a new draft resolution if the current one wasn't revised to reflect important elements of the Siniora Plan. On 11 August, a much revised draft resolution was presented, incorporating many elements from the Siniora Plan. It was adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council as United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. On 12 August, both the Lebanese government and Hezbollah accepted the UN resolution, and on 13 August the Israeli government did the same. Below is the official English wording of the Siniora Plan, from the Lebanese government's \\"Rebuild Lebanon\\" website: # An undertaking to release the Lebanese and Israeli prisoners and detainees through the ICRC. # The withdrawal of the Israeli army behind the Blue Line, and the return of the displaced to their villages. # A commitment from the Security Council to place the Shebaa Farms area and the Kfarshouba Hills under UN jurisdiction until border delineation and Lebanese sovereignty over them are fully settled. While in UN custody, the area will be accessible to Lebanese property owners there. Further, Israel surrenders all remaining landmine maps in South Lebanon to the UN. # The Lebanese government extends its authority over its territory through its own legitimate armed forces, such that there will be no weapons or authority other than that of the Lebanese state as stipulated in the Taef national reconciliation document. # The UN international force, operating in South Lebanon, is supplemented and enhanced in numbers, equipment, mandate and scope of operation, as needed, in order to undertake urgent humanitarian and relief work and guarantee stability and security in the south so that those who fled their homes can return. # The UN, in cooperation with the relevant parties, undertakes the necessary measures to once again put into effect the Armistice Agreement signed by Lebanon and Israel in 1949, and to insure adherence to the provisions of that agreement, as well as to explore possible amendments to or development of said provisions, as necessary. # The international community commits to support Lebanon on all levels, and to assist it in facing the tremendous burden resulting from the human, social and economic tragedy which has afflicted the country, especially in the areas of relief, reconstruction and rebuilding of the national economy.

Legacy His daughter's \\"Dear Dad\\",http://www.jewishpress.com/content.cfm?contentid=37965&sContentid;=1 written for his ninth yahrtzeit, contains examples of one of Rabbi Klass' major accomplishments: the popularization of the use of a dash in writing G-d's name, in English, as the normative form by Orthodox Jews. He and Rabbi Meir Kahane, whom he hired, broke this barrier, the latter also expanding upon this in the books he authored. Although Rabbi Klass turned over his halachic Questions & Answers column to his nephew Rabbi Yaakov Klass well before his death, one way in which the column affected worldwide Jewry was as the inspiration of the acronym AYLOR - Ask Your Local Orthodox Rabbi. http://forums.torah.org/viewtopic.php?t=24853&start;=75&sid;=5df2fb594c005133119acbdc70fc5bb5http://www.ottmall.com/mj_ht_arch/v6/mj_v6i04.html, a British site Some have attempted to change AYLOR by having \\"O\\" stand for \\"Ordained.\\".http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/A12.html Rabbi Klass' point was that information in his column was meant to educate, not to provide an absolute ruling.

It is an old native breed which has historically lived on farms in the eastern part of Denmark and southernmost part of Sweden (i.e. on both sides of The Sound, the narrow strait that separates the Danish island of Zealand from the southern tip of the Scandinavian peninsula), serving as a guard dog, rat catcher and hunting dog. The breed's soft and gentle temperament also makes them excellent companion dogs. There are some indications that the breed originates from the pinscher breeds and the British white hunting terriers.  Name  The Danish‚ÄìSwedish Farmdog became a recognized breed in Denmark and Sweden in 1987. At that time, the two countries got together and agreed on the name of the breed, and also on the breed standard written by judge and breeder Lars Adeheimer, Sweden and judge Ole Staunskjaer, Denmark. The DSF was used as a farm dog for many hundreds of years, and before becoming a recognized breed it was known under the local name \\"Skrabba\\", \\"Sk√•neterrier\\", \\"r√•ttehund\\", \\"rat dog\\").  Appearance  The FCI standard says that a DSF should be 30‚Äì39 cm of height with a compact body. The relation between withers height and body length should be 9 to 10. The head is rather small and triangular with a well- emphasized stop. The coat is hard, short and smooth in texture, with white as a dominating colour, with one or several patches of different colour combination. The tail could be long, half bobtail or bobtail.  Temperament  The Danish‚ÄìSwedish Farmdog is a very friendly, easygoing breed. Not only does it work on farms as a rat exterminator and watch dog, but it is also a companion to adults, and is known to befriend and play with the children of the household. The Danish‚ÄìSwedish Farmdog is unlike a terrier ‚Äì even though it is often mistaken as one ‚Äì it is very mild and gentle in temper. Unlike the high-strung nature of the terrier, the milder nature of the DSF allows it to do its job, as well as be calm and affectionate when unoccupied. This makes it an ideal house dog. The DSF is a not a high energy dog, but loves having a job. The breed is new to the US, and can only now start to be seen in sports such as flyball and dog agility. The DSF is also known for its excellent mousing skills and can perform sports such as going to ground and earthdog. They are also very speedy and quick, and love all types of lure coursing. In 2010, the breed club, Danish-Swedish Farmdogs USA, made application to AKC-FSS for recognition of the breed. In January 2011, the American Kennel Club (AKC) added the breed to its Foundation Stock Service. The Danish-Swedish Farmdog is now eligible to compete in various AKC companion events such as obedience, agility, rally and more. In November 2011, the AKC announced that as of July 2012, FSS breeds would be eligible for Open Conformation shows.

He is also the protagonist in six sequels to that novel. On screen, Tibbs is the protagonist in the Oscar-winning 1967 film In the Heat of the Night and in its sequels, They Call Me Mister Tibbs! (1970) and The Organization (1971). He is also portrayed in the 1988-1995 television series. Novels In the novels, Tibbs works for the police department of Pasadena, California. In the films, portrayed by Academy Award winner Sidney Poitier, he first works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but in the sequels, he works for the San Francisco Police. The Tibbs films are mentioned in the sequel novels. When asked about the movies, Tibbs emphasizes that he's from Pasadena, not Philadelphia. He also praises Poitier's looks and acting ability. In a short story (see below), the film character meets his literary counterpart. In the novels, Tibbs returns to Pasadena as a police officer. In the films, Tibbs also returns to his law enforcement career, in Philadelphia and then in San Francisco. In the television series, set a few years after the first film, Tibbs returns to Sparta, Mississippi‚Äîwhere the action in the first film takes place‚Äîto become Chief of Detectives under Sparta's police chief, Bill Gillespie. Tibbs has a black belt in karate and a brown belt in aikido. Like many fictional detectives, he is also perceptive and a polymath. He demonstrates an extensive depth and breadth of knowledge in many fields of the arts, sciences, and modern culture. His demeanor is cold and intellectual. He tolerates non-criminal behaviors outside of the social mainstream, such as nudism. Tibbs is uninterested in glory or media attention. He is a perfectionist, and his sole motivation is duty and justice. In the films, Tibbs displays more anger over issues of race than in the books. For example, in the novel In The Heat of the Night, the phrase \\"They call me Mr. Tibbs\\" is a statement ending in a period, while in the movie, it's an angry exclamation. Physically, Tibbs is slender, quick, strong, and handsome. His nose is narrow, and his mouth is \\"straight and determined\\". His skin tone is neither exceptionally light nor dark. Tibbs has several romantic liaisons in the novels and seems to be well on the way to be getting married by the end of the last Tibbs novel Singapore. In the first film, Tibbs is not married, although in the second and third films he has a wife (played by Barbara McNair) and two children. For the book The Great Detectives (1978), edited by Otto Penzler, John Ball contributed a short story in which Ball (or rather his counterpart in Virgil Tibbs' universe) meets with Tibbs and asks him to recount his upbringing. This short story establishes that Tibbs' superior on the police force encouraged Ball's fictionalizations of Tibbs' cases to promote positive public relations. \\"'I have a letter from Otto Penzler,' I said... 'Otto has asked me for a piece about your background. How much may I tell him?' I should insert a footnote here. Virgil Tibbs is basically a quiet, self-effacing man... He has mentioned to me more than once that my accounts of some of his cases have proved somewhat embarrassing to him. However, Chief McGowan feels that these books help explain the police function to the citizenry at large and to show how modern, enlightened police departments function.\\" In the Heat of the Night Virgil Tibbs is an African American police detective who is detained on suspicion of murder solely on the basis of his skin color while passing through the small town of Wells, somewhere in the Carolinas (Sparta, Mississippi in the film). When Tibbs' innocence and status as a homicide investigator is confirmed, political pressure in the town leads to his temporary assignment to aid the Wells (Sparta) police on the case - despite the reluctance of the town's racist chief of police, Bill Gillespie. Tibbs is a diligent, hard working detective who does not accept the racism of his new surroundings. When his erstwhile supervisor, Chief Gillespie, remarks that \\"Virgil is a pretty fancy name for a black boy like you,\\" and asks what people call him at home, Tibbs is quick to respond, \\"They call me Mister Tibbs.\\" The line is delivered more forcefully in the film than it is in the novel. The Tibbs character and his famous quote were both ranked in the AFI 100 Years... series. The Tibbs character was ranked as the 19th greatest hero in the history of American cinema whilst his famous quote was ranked as the 16th greatest quote. Television In the NBC/CBS television series In the Heat of the Night, Tibbs is a native of Sparta, Mississippi who left the South and became a police detective in Philadelphia. During a visit to his hometown for the funeral of his mother, the politically opportunistic mayor offers Tibbs the position of Chief of Detectives because of his previous experience with Gillespie. Tibbs accepts the position, making him second-in-command to the reluctant Police Chief. Although Tibbs and Gillespie have their disagreements about police methods and use of limited local resources, they prove an effective partnership. Tibbs' sophisticated detective skills complement Gillespie's intimate knowledge of the area and its population. Tibbs is portrayed in the series by Howard Rollins, who garnered critical acclaim for his work in the film A Soldier's Story and for his Academy Award-nominated performance in the film Ragtime. Substance abuse problems led to fewer Rollins' appearances on the series, and he eventually was fired. The Tibbs family was written out of the series.

The company has been compared to more traditional TV measurement firms like Nielsen which rely on the people meter to gather viewership data. Prior to Samba TV, Navin was the president and co-founder of BitTorrent, Inc. He joined Bram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent, in 2004 and reportedly handled business and company- related matters while Cohen focused on engineering and product development. According to a post on his blog, Navin has resigned from BitTorrent in order to focus on his new venture Samba TV, and his new venture capital fund i/o Ventures. Navin reportedly evaluated Cohen's invention for Yahoo! in 2004. Although it was a notable development for the Internet, BitTorrent was widely considered to be the bane of the film industry, because it made the cost of transferring large files, including unlicensed film copies, negligible to the end user.  Early career  Navin is a 1999 graduate of Claremont McKenna College with a dual B.A. in Government and Economics. Before BitTorrent, he was employed at Yahoo! from 2002 to 2004 in its Corporate Development group which handled corporate strategy and acquisitions. Before Yahoo!, Navin worked on Wall Street with Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch both as an investment banker and research analyst. In 2000, Navin helped start a technology-based financial services company called Epoch Partners. Epoch was essentially the investment banking arm of several online stock brokerages including Charles Schwab, Ameritrade, and TD Waterhouse. Epoch Partners was eventually acquired by Goldman Sachs in 2001.  Commercializing BitTorrent  Ashwin Navin in 2007 Cohen entrusted Navin with the responsibility of crafting a business model for BitTorrent with hopes of bringing BitTorrent out of the fringes and into the mainstream. Navin has assumed the public face of the company as an evangelist for its commercial viability. In 2007, Navin launched 3 commercial products: the BitTorrent Entertainment Network in February, the BitTorrent SDK in June, and BitTorrent DNA in October. As the foundation for these products, in 2006 Navin acquired uTorrent which is the largest Torrent client in the world, outside China. To catalyze BitTorrent's commercialization, Navin began by engaging movie industry executives directly. Although predicted by many to be highly unlikely, BitTorrent has struck relationships with many major media companies including Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, MTV, Lionsgate, Kadokawa Pictures, and some others. Beyond copyright issues, BitTorrent also faced struggles with Cable companies and ISPs which were overwhelmed with high volumes of P2P traffic on their networks. In the wake of FCC hearings that pitted Comcast and BitTorrent against each other for traffic management policies that inhibited P2P file transfers, Navin was responsible for striking a deal with Comcast that resolved the companies' differences and defused a contested issue in the Network Neutrality debate.

On 13 May 1971, the Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi al-Tal issued law number 26 in 1971 to establish the Jordan Press Foundation which is the publisher. On 2 June 1971, the first issue of Al Rai was published. The daily was the second newspaper to be published by a company owned by the Jordanian government. The first being Al Sharq Al Arabi (ÿµÿ≠ŸäŸÅÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ±ŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä), which had its first issue published in 1923. The newspaper is owned and published by Jordan Press Foundation. The company later began to publish an English daily, The Jordan Times. Al Rai launched its Palestinian edition on 5 October 2005. In August 2008, the daily started its e-journal, Minbar Al Rai, and in May 2009 it launched a weekly newspaper for advertisements. Its estimated circulation was 45,000 copies in 1985 whereas it was 90,000 copies in 2003. The officials of the paper stated that the daily's circulation was 80,000 in 2010. Content and staff The newspaper is composed of five sections: * Mahalleyyat (Local news) * Arabs and the World: Section for international news. * Sports * Economy * Literature and Arts The editors-in-chief of Al Ra'i are appointed by the Jordanian government. The former editors-in-chief of the daily include Abdul Wahab Zaghilat, Samih Maaytah and Mohammad Tal. In late 2011 Majid Asfour was appointed editor-in- chief. Tariq AL-Momani is the current editor-in-chief of the paper.

The scenarios for both films were co-written by Lang's then-wife Thea von Harbou, based upon the epic poem Nibelungenlied written around AD 1200. Die Nibelungen received its UK premiere at the Royal Albert Hall in London, where it played for 40 performances between 29 April and 20 June 1924.http://catalogue.royalalberthall.com/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Performance&id;=Obyv_Giraimeax&pos;=1 Siegfried was released in the United States on 23 August 1925, premiering at the Century Theatre in New York City in the short-lived Phonofilm sound-on- film process. Kriemhild's Revenge was released in the U.S. in 1928. Plot summary=Die Nibelungen: Siegfried Siegfried with Alberich the dwarfThe title character Siegfried, son of King Siegmund of Xanten, masters the art of forging a sword at the shop of Mime. Siegfried hears the tales of the kingdom of Burgundy, the kings who rule there, as well as of Kriemhild, the princess of Burgundy. Siegfried announces he wants to win her hand in marriage, much to the amusement of the smiths. Siegfried demands to be told the way. Mime, who is envious of Siegfried's skill as a swordsmith, claims there is a shortcut to Burgundy through the Wood of Woden, wherein dwell all kinds of dangerous creatures. Siegfried encounters a dragon, and deviates from his path to slay it. He touches its hot, yellow blood and suddenly understands the language of the birds, who instruct him to bathe in the dragon's blood in order to become invincible ‚Äî except for one spot on his shoulder blade, covered by a falling lime (linden) leaf. Soon after, the powerful Siegfried trespasses on the land of the Nibelungs and is attacked by Alberich, King of the Dwarves, who has turned himself invisible. Siegfried defeats Alberich, who offers Siegfried a net of invisibility and transformation if he spares his life, whereupon Alberich offers to make Siegfried \\"the richest king on earth!\\" [intertitle 1.14]. While Siegfried is mesmerized by the treasure and the sword Balmung, Alberich tries to defeat him, but dies in the attempt. With his dying breath, Alberich curses all inheritors of the treasure and he and his dwarves turn to stone. Siegfried finally arrives in Burgundy in his new guise as King of twelve kingdoms. A fight breaks out between Siegfried and King Gunther and his adviser Hagen of Tronje, which is interrupted by the appearance of beautiful princess Kriemhild. Hagen asks Siegfried to aid Kriemhild's brother, King Gunther, to win the hand of Brunhild, the Queen of Iceland. The men travel to Brunhild's kingdom, where Siegfried feigns vassalage to Gunther so that he can avoid Brunhild's challenge and instead use the net's power of invisibility to help Gunther beat the powerful Queen in a threefold battle of strength. The men return to Burgundy where Gunther marries Brunhild and Siegfried weds Kriemhild. Brunhild is not, however, completely defeated. She suspects deceit and refuses to consummate the marriage. Hagen again convinces Siegfried to help. Siegfried transforms himself into Gunther and battles Brunhild and removes her arm-ring during battle, after which she submits to his will. Siegfried leaves the real Gunther to consummate the marriage. Kriemhild discovers Brunhild's armlet and asks Siegfried about it. Siegfried discloses the truth to Kriemhild about his role in Brunhild's defeat. When the Nibelungen treasure that Siegfried acquired from Alberich arrives at the court of Burgundy as Kriemhild's wedding gift, Brunhild becomes more suspicious about Siegfried's feigned vassalage to Gunther. Brunhild dons the Queen Mother's jewellery and proceeds to the cathedral to enter as the first person, as is her right as Queen of Burgundy. Kriemhild tries to take Brunhild's right of way and an argument erupts between the two Queens. Kriemhild betrays her husband's and brother's secret to Brunhild, who then confronts Gunther. Brunhild demands that Siegfried must be killed, which she justifies by claiming that Siegfried stole her maidenhood [intertitle 1.94] when he struggled with her on her wedding night. Hagen von Tronje and King Gunther conspire to murder Siegfried during a hunt in the Odenwald. Hagen deceives Kriemhild into divulging Siegfried's weak spot by sewing a cross on the spot in Siegfried's tunic. After the hunt, Hagen challenges Siegfried to a race to a nearby spring. When Siegfried is on his knees drinking, Hagen pierces him from behind with a spear. In an evil twist of bitter revenge, Brunhild confesses that she lied about Siegfried stealing her maidenhood in order to avenge Gunther's deceit of her. Kriemhild demands her family avenge her husband's death at the hands of Hagen, but her family is complicit in the murder, and so they protect Hagen. Kriemhild swears revenge against Hagen while Brunhild commits suicide at the foot of Siegfried's corpse, which has been laid in state in the cathedral. A transformation sequence from Die Nibelungen: Siegfried: After Siegfried's death, Kriemhild has a vision of Siegfried's last farewell to her. Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (Kriemhild's Revenge) Kriemhild tries to win over the people of Burgundy to help her exact revenge against Hagen, to whom her brothers have sworn allegiance. Kriemhild bribes the people with money and treasure from the Nibelungen hoard. Margrave R√ºdiger von Bechelaren arrives unannounced to woo Kriemhild on behalf of his King, King Etzel, who resides in the land of the Huns. Kriemhild initially declines, but ultimately she recognises the opportunity for revenge in her marriage with Etzel and in R√ºdiger's allegiance to her. She forces R√ºdiger to swear allegiance to her on his sword. At that very moment, news arrives that Hagen has stolen her wedding gift, the Nibelungen hoard, which Hagen has, unbeknownst to all, sunk into the Rhine river. Kriemhild travels to Etzel's lands and accepts his hand. As a gift to Kriemhild for bearing him a son, Ortlieb, Etzel grants her a wish. Kriemhild requests Etzel to invite her family to celebrate the Midsummer Solstice with them in the Hun kingdom. In the meantime, Kriemhild bribes Etzel's Hun warriors with money and treasure to avenge her and attack Hagen. When the Burgundians arrive, the Huns launch an attack on the Burgundian soldiers during their feast in the caves where the Huns reside. The Burgundian Knight Dankwart manages to escape the melee and warns the Burgundian kings who are feasting with Etzel and Kriemhild in Etzel's palace. Upon hearing of the treacherous attack, Hagen of Tronje murders Etzel's son, and battle breaks out. Dietrich of Bern manages to negotiate an exit from the hall for Etzel's royal entourage, which leaves the Burgundian guests imprisoned in Etzel's palace. The remaining 45 minutes of the film consist of multiple battles in which the Huns attack the Burgundians. Kriemhild offers her family freedom if they surrender Hagen to her. They decline. Ultimately Kriemhild calls upon R√ºdiger to fulfill his oath of allegiance by attacking Hagen. R√ºdiger refuses, but is forced to by Etzel. At the beginning of the battle, R√ºdiger is killed by Volker of Alzey after R√ºdiger of Bechlarn himself smote his nearly son-in- law Giselher of Burgundy with his sword. Gerenot carries his dead brother outside the hall to show his sister what she has done with her vindictiveness. Kriemhild grieves for Giselher and begs Gerenot for a last time to surrender Hagen of Tronje to her, but he refuses again and so is killed by the Huns. In a final act of desperation, Kriemhild commands the palace be set alight. As the flames smoulder, only Gunther and Hagen survive. Dietrich of Bern fetches the two remaining men from the palace and delivers them to Kriemhild, who demands Hagen to reveal the hiding place of the Nibelungen hoard. When Hagen states that he has sworn not to reveal the hiding place as long as one of his kings is still alive, Kriemhild commands Gunther's beheading. When Hagen reveals that no one now knows the location of the treasure apart from him and God, and that God will never tell more than he does, Kriemhild grabs Siegfried's sword from Hagen and cuts him down. Infuriated by Kriemhild's act of murder, Sword Master Hildebrandt stabs Kriemhild from behind. Etzel's final words are that Kriemhild should be taken back home to her dead husband, Siegfried, because she never belonged to any other man [intertitle 2.159].

Paul Groner, University of Hawaii Press The various splits within the monastic organization went together with the introduction and emphasis on Abhidhammic literature by some schools. This literature was specific to each school, and arguments and disputes between the schools were often based on these Abhidhammic writings. However, actual splits were originally based on disagreements on vinaya (monastic discipline), though later on, by about 100 CE or earlier, they could be based on doctrinal disagreement.Harvey,Introduction to Buddhism, Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 74 Pre-sectarian Buddhism, however, did not have Abhidhammic scriptures, except perhaps for a basic framework, and not all of the early schools developed an Abhidhamma literature. Pre-sectarian Buddhism Pre-sectarian Buddhism, also called \\"early Buddhism\\", \\"the earliest Buddhism\\", and \\"original Buddhism\\", is the Buddhism that existed before the various subsects of Buddhism came into being. Some of the contents and teachings of this pre-sectarian Buddhism may be deduced from the earliest Buddhist texts, which by themselves are already sectarian. Early Buddhist schools The early Buddhist schools are those schools into which the Buddhist monastic sa·πÖgha initially split, due originally to differences in vinaya and later also due to doctrinal differences and geographical separation of groups of monks. Formation The original sa·πÖgha split into the first early schools (generally believed to be the Sthavira nikƒÅya and the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika) a significant number of years after the death of Gautama Buddha. According to scholar Collett Cox \\"most scholars would agree that even though the roots of the earliest recognized groups predate A≈õoka, their actual separation did not occur until after his death.\\"Disputed Dharmas: Early Buddhist Theories on Existence. by Collett Cox. The Institute for Buddhist Studies. Tokyo: 1995. p. 23 Later, these first early schools split into further divisions such as the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins and the Dharmaguptakas, and ended up numbering, traditionally, about 18 or 20 schools. In fact, there are several overlapping lists of 18 schools preserved in the Buddhist tradition, totaling about twice as many, though some may be alternative names. It is thought likely that the number is merely conventional. Teachings After the Sangha split into the various early Buddhist schools and the Mahayana, there appeared further elaborations and interpretations of the preserved teachings, and various new doctrines, scriptures and practices. They were composed and developed by the monastic communities, concerning issues deemed important at the time. =Ideological differences= The schools sometimes split over ideological differences concerning the \\"real\\" meaning of teachings in the Sutta Pi·π≠aka, and sometimes over disagreement concerning the proper observance of vinaya. These ideologies became embedded in large works such as the Abhidhammas and commentaries. Comparison of existing versions of the Suttapi·π≠aka of various sects shows evidence that ideologies from the Abhidhammas sometimes found their way back into the Suttapi·π≠akas to support the statements made in those Abhidhammas. Literalism Some of these developments may be seen as later elaborations on the teachings. According to Gombrich, unintentional literalism was a major force for change in the early doctrinal history of Buddhism. This means that texts were interpreted paying too much attention to the precise words used and not enough to the speaker's intention, the spirit of the text. Some later doctrinal developments in the early Buddhist schools show scholastic literalism, which is a tendency to take the words and phrases of earlier texts (maybe the Buddha's own words) in such a way as to read-in distinctions which it was never intended to make. Preservation of older ideas The later Mahayana schools may have preserved ideas which were abandoned by the \\"orthodox\\" Theravada, such as the Three Bodies doctrine, the idea of consciousness (vijnana) as a continuum, and devotional elements such as the worship of saints. Newly introduced concepts Some Buddhist concepts that were not existent in the time of pre-sectarian Buddhism are: * \\"Building paramis\\" or paramitas. The ten paramis are described in Theravadin texts of late origin, while the (Mahayana) paramitas are found in the Mahayana Sutras such as the Dasabhumika Sutra and the Surangama Sutra, also of late origin. * The Bodhisattva vows, which is only found in the Mahayana Sutras. =Newly composed scriptures= In later times, the arguments between the various schools were based in these newly introduced teachings, practices and beliefs, and monks sought to validate these newly introduced teachings and concepts by referring to the older texts (Sutta-pitaka and Vinaya-pitaka). Most often, the various new Abhidhamma and Mahayana teachings were bases for arguments between sects. Abhidhamma As the last major division of the canon, the Abhidhamma Pitaka has had a checkered history. It was not accepted as canonical by the Mahasanghika school\\"Abhidhamma Pitaka.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2008.Buddhist Sects in India, Nalinaksha Dutt, 1978, p. 58 and several other schools. Another school included most of the Khuddaka Nikaya within the Abhidhamma Pitaka. Also, the Pali version of the Abhidhamma is a strictly Theravada collection, and has little in common with the Abhidhamma works recognized by other Buddhist schools.\\"Buddhism.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

The various Abhidhamma philosophies of the various early schools have no agreement on doctrineKanai Lal Hazra, Pali Language and Literature ‚Äì A Systematic Survey and Historical Survey, 1994, Vol. 1, p. 415 and belong to the period of 'Divided Buddhism' (as opposed to Undivided Buddhism). The earliest texts of the Pali Canon (the Sutta Nipata and parts of the Jataka), together with the first four (and early) Nikayas of the Suttapitaka, have no mention of (the texts of) the Abhidhamma Pitaka.Kanai Lal Hazra, Pali Language and Literature ‚Äì A Systematic Survey and Historical Survey, 1994, Vol. 1, p. 412 The Abhidhamma is also not mentioned at the report of the First Buddhist Council, directly after the death of the Buddha. This report of the first council does mention the existence of the Vinaya and the five Nikayas (of the Suttapitaka).I.B. Horner, Book of the Discipline, Volume 5, p. 398The Mahisasaka Account of the First Council mentions the four agamas here. see http://santifm1.0.googlepages.com/thefirstcouncil(mahisasakaversion) Although the literature of the various Abhidhamma Pitakas began as a kind of commentarial supplement upon the earlier teachings in the Suttapitaka, it soon led to new doctrinal and textual developments and became the focus of a new form of scholarly monastic life.MacMillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004, p. 1. The various Abhidhamma works were starting to be composed from about 200 years after the passing away of the Buddha. Traditionally, it is believed (in Theravadin culture) that the Abhidhamma was taught by Buddha to his late mother who was living in Tavatimsa heaven. However, this is rejected by scholars, who believe that only small parts of the Abhidhamma literature may have been existent in a very early form. Some schools of Buddhism had important disagreements on subjects of Abhidhamma, while having a largely similar Sutta-pitaka and Vinaya-pitaka. The arguments and conflicts between them were thus often on matters of philosophical Abhidhammic origin, not on matters concerning the actual words and teachings of Buddha. One impetus for composing new scriptures like the Adhidhammas of the various schools, according to some scholars, was that Buddha left no clear statement about the ontological status of the world ‚Äì about what really exists. Subsequently, later Buddhists have themselves defined what exists and what not (in the Abhidhammic scriptures), leading to disagreements. Parts of the Khuddaka Nikaya Oliver Abeynayake has the following to say on the dating of the various books in the Khuddaka Nikaya: > :‚ÄòThe Khuddaka Nikaya can easily be divided into two strata, one being early > and the other late. The texts Sutta Nipata, Itivuttaka, Dhammapada, > Therigatha (Theragatha), Udana, and Jataka tales belong to the early > stratum. The texts Khuddakapatha, Vimanavatthu, Petavatthu, Niddesa, > Patisambhidamagga, Apadana, Buddhavamsa and Cariyapitaka can be categorized > in the later stratum.‚ÄôA textual and Historical Analysis of the Khuddaka > Nikaya ‚Äì Oliver Abeynayake Ph.D. , Colombo, First Edition ‚Äì 1984, p. 113. The texts in the early stratum date from before the second council (earlier than 100 years after Buddha‚Äôs parinibbana), while the later stratum is from after the second council, which means they are definitely later additions to the Sutta Pitaka, and that they might not have been the original teachings by the Buddha, but later compositions by disciples. The following books of the Khuddaka Nikaya can thus be regarded as later additions: *the Khuddakapatha *the Vimanavatthu *the Petavatthu *the Niddesa *the Patisambhidamagga *the Apadana *the Buddhavamsa *the Cariyapitaka and the following three which are included in the Burmese Canon *the Milindapanha *the Nettippakarana *the Petakopadesa The original verses of the Jatakas are recognized as being amongst the earliest part of the Canon, but the accompanying (and more famous) Jataka Stories are purely commentarial, an obvious later addition. Parivara The Parivara, the last book of the Vinaya Pitaka, is a later addition to the Vinaya Pitaka.This work (the Parivara) is in fact a very much later composition, and probably the work of a Ceylonese Thera. from: Book of the Discipline, vol.

Accessed August 19, 2008. History=11-12 Wing Construction on what is now the 11-12 wing of the high school began in 1962. WTHS opened in September 1963, serving grades 6-9 while parts of the building were still under construction. Each successive year, all of the grades incremented by 1 (1964 was 7-10, 1965 was 8-11 and 1966 was 9-12) In 1966 the first High School Class of WTHS graduated. In the early 1970s, the school became overcrowded (a problem that would plague the school on and off through 1998). In the fall of 1968, the 7th grade was sent to the new Birches Elementary School, occupying 1/2 of that facility. For the 1969/70 school year, the 7th grade returned to WTHS which operated an AM and PM session, staggered over 4 lunch periods. The 9th through 12th grades taking the morning session and the 7th and 8th grades, the afternoon. In the 1970-71 school year, the 7th grade was sent to Wedgewood Middle School and WTHS operated a traditional single session. In the 1971-1972 school year, the 7th and 8th were sent to Wedgewood Middle School and the school operated split sessions with grades 11-12 attending from 7:30 AM to noon and grades 9-10 attending 12:30 PM to 5:00 PM. For 1972-73 it was back to split sessions in the high school with grades 10-12 taking the morning shift. As a result, a two-story addition was opened in September 1973 to the right side of the building, as well as an additional gym and a new library. The school continued to serve students in grade 7-12 until the 1979-1980 school year. As a result of this overcrowding and moving of grades, the Class of 1975 was the youngest class as 7th graders, then again the youngest class as 8th graders, then again the youngest class as 9th graders, and finally, with split sessions, the youngest class in their session, as 10th graders. 9-10 Wing In the late 1970s, construction on what would be the township's first middle school began. In September 1980, WTMS opened, serving 7th and 8th graders. Because of its location right next to WTHS (at the time, what is now the location of the Core was just a parking lot), the two schools would often share facilities. Despite a new rather large school to house 7th and 8th graders, and more room in the high school, the township was exploding in population at the time, and both WTHS and WTMS were overcrowded only a few years after the middle school opened. In the mid-1980s, planning for yet another new middle school was underway. This time, however, because WT's elementary schools also faced overcrowding, the school district went ahead and built two schools, which would enroll grades 6 through 8, thus relieving all the elementary schools in the district from 6th graders (they also were relieved of all kindergarteners, thanks to an addition at Grenloch Terrace Early Childhood Center). In fall of 1989, Chestnut Ridge Middle School and Orchard Valley Middle School opened for grades 6-8. The former WTMS became part of the high school complex, renamed as the 9/10 Building (as it served mostly students in 9th and 10th grade), while the original HS was also renamed as the 11/12 Building. The transition wasn't smooth, however. Both CRMS and OVMS weren't finished in time for the new school year. As a result, the newly formed WTHS complex started its first month with split sessions. High school students would have class starting early in the day, while all middle school students would have class in the late afternoon/early evening. During this time period, the high school students also had to share their lockers with the temp middle school students. The 9/10 building has H-Hall, I-Pod, J-Hall, K-Pod, and L-Pod. The \\"Pods\\" are large hallways with bathrooms in the center. The classrooms are arranged around the pods like a courtyard. There were lockers in the center of each pod, but they have since been removed due to the addition of the lockers in the core.

The new cafeterias are in the core. J-Hall: Originally called \\"E-Hall\\" before the 9/10 building was connected to the 11/12 building. The adaptive gym, orchestra room and nurses office is downstairs. Upstairs are classrooms. The original library was here until the core expansion. The old library was converted to the 9/10 adaptive gym. Core building Washington Township's population continued to grow, therefore, they needed to expand the high school yet again. Under a $50 million district wide improvement program,referendum amount:, accessed June 20, 2007. a third building was to be built on the site between the 11/12 and 9/10 buildings. The Core building would physically connect the two existing buildings and would include a 2500-seat auditorium (known as the Investors Bank Performing Arts Center as of 2015, formerly known as Commerce Bank Arts Centre and the TD Bank Arts Centre), administrative and guidance offices, a new Media Center (library), new cafeteria (for 9-10 wing students) and more classrooms. Construction on the core building began in the summer of 1996. Parts of the building opened in 1998, and some classes were moved immediately from both the 11/12 and 9/10 buildings. The new WTHS The entire building was completed before the 1998-1999 school year. WTHS was now one building for the first time since the 1988-1989 school year. The three parts of the building were renamed the 11/12 wing, core, and 9/10 wing, and hallways were renamed to integrate the building. Because the new building featured a new library, a united guidance office, and cafeteria for the 9/10 wing, the old libraries and guidance offices in each of the wings as well as the old 9/10 cafeteria were able to be renovated for other uses.

It was produced for the State of Connecticut Department of Americanization by the Worcester Film Corp., a company founded in 1918 in Worcester, Massachusetts. The film was rediscovered and preserved by Northeast Historic Film (NHF) a regional moving image archive in New England. Synopsis of film An enterprising young Italian who comes to America is forced to take a position as a day laborer, which is far below his ability and standard of living, solely because he cannot speak English. Even a laborer, however, must know the language of the country where he is employed, as Pete soon found to his cost. An unattended freight elevator, a sign in English that he could not read, a struggle of an instant, and then the hospital. It was a sadder and wiser man who came out a few weeks later. When he passed the post office, and a saw a sign in several languages calling upon foreigners to learn English, and to attend night school, he was prepared for the message that was destined to change the entire course of his life. Night school for Pete was the result. Anyone familiar with such work will experience anew the keen realization of what it means to the newcomer, the crowded roomful of eager listeners, trying so hard, following so patiently and docilely, the enthusiastic teacher's efforts, in short, the making of Pete. He now is able to secure a suitable position and rises rapidly. :Education Film Magazine (1920) Cast *Emile De Verny - Italian immigrant Production and background Vintage Connecticut government reports on the making of the film and its dissemination, indicate that the film was shown to more than 112,500 people the year it was made, and that copies were sold to other states interested in Americanization programs. The film was targeted to industrial workers and contains location filming at the Hartford Rubber Works Company. The film was lost until 1999 when Alan Kattelle donated a film copy among a collection of other reels to Northeast Historic Film. The Kattelle print was on 28mm film stock, an extremely rare format that was primarily used for educational film distribution from 1913 to 1923.

McGee was one of the few bright spots on the 1958 team, which finished the season with a league-low 1-10-1 record, the worst in Packers history. During 1958, he led the NFL in yards per catch average (23.2), punting yards (2,716), and net yards average (36.0). After Vince Lombardi took over as head coach in January 1959, McGee may be best known for his performance during the first Super Bowl game. He helped the team to six NFL championship appearances, five NFL championship wins, and two Super Bowl titles during the remaining years of his career. He was a Pro Bowl selection during the season. Despite reductions in playing time due to injuries and age, McGee's final two seasons were the ones for which his career is best remembered. In the 1966 season, McGee caught only four passes for 91 yards and a touchdown as the Packers recorded a 12‚Äì2 record and advanced to Super Bowl I against the Kansas City Chiefs. McGee did not expect to play in the game, and he violated his team's curfew policy and spent the night before the Super Bowl out on the town. The next morning, he told starting receiver Boyd Dowler, \\"I hope you don't get hurt. I'm not in very good shape,\\" alluding to his hangover. Dowler went down with a separated shoulder on the Packers' second drive of the game, and McGee, who had to borrow a teammate's helmet because he had not brought his own out of the locker room, was put into the game. A few plays later, McGee made a one-handed reception of a pass from Bart Starr, took off past Chiefs defender Fred Williamson, and ran 37 yards to score the first touchdown in Super Bowl history. This was a repeat of his performance in the NFL championship game two weeks earlier, when he had also caught a touchdown pass after relieving an injured Dowler. By the end of the game, McGee had recorded seven receptions for 138 yards and two touchdowns, in a 35-10 Packers' victory. The following year, he recorded a 35-yard reception in the third quarter of Super Bowl II that set up a touchdown in the Packers' 33‚Äì14 win over the Oakland Raiders. McGee retired shortly after the game and finished his 12-season career with 345 receptions for 6,346 yards and 12 carries for 121 yards. He scored 51 touchdowns (50 receiving and one fumble recovery). On special teams, he punted 256 times for 10,647 yards, an average of 41.6 yards per punt, and returned four kickoffs for 69 yards. Career as a celebrity restaurateur McGee entered into a restaurant partnership with Packer left guard Fuzzy Thurston; they operated the Left Guard Charcoal Houses in Appleton, Fond du Lac, Madison, Green Bay, and Eau Claire. They also operated the Left Guard Steak Houses in Menasha, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul, and the Left End Steak House in Manitowoc. In addition, McGee co-founded the Mexican restaurant chain Chi-Chi's. Life after the NFL After retiring from football, McGee became a major partner in developing the popular Chi-Chi's chain of Mexican restaurants with restaurateur Marno McDermott. McGee was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1975. His ties to the Packers continued from 1979 to 1998 when he served as the color commentator for radio broadcasts of Packers' football games. With droll wit and keen insights, McGee was extremely popular as a color commentator. McGee founded the Max McGee National Research Center for Juvenile Diabetes in 1999 at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. He raised money for diabetes research. Cancer McGee was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 56 in April 1989, but it was caught early and he recovered after surgery. Death In 2007, at the age of 75, McGee died after a fall at his home in Minnetonka Beach, Minnesota, a suburb west of Minneapolis. His wife said he had been suffering from an early form of Alzheimer's disease for the previous five years.

It can be used as the first step in debugging software or system problems. Process Explorer can be used to track down problems. For example, it provides a means to list or search for named resources that are held by a process or all processes. This can be used to track down what is holding a file open and preventing its use by another program. As another example, it can show the command lines used to start a program, allowing otherwise identical processes to be distinguished.

Under the control of his two sons, John A. Dewar Jr. and Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Dewar, the brand expanded to become a global market leader by 1896 and began to win several awards, including a gold medal in the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Tommy became famous as the author of a travel journal, Ramble Round the Globe, which documented his travels while publicizing the Dewar name. Dewar's eventually expanded their product by constructing the Aberfeldy Distillery in 1896. The company joined Distillers Company in 1925. Distillers was acquired by Guinness in 1986, and Guinness merged with Grand Metropolitan to form Diageo in 1997. Diageo sold Dewar's to Bacardi the next year. Dewar's rose to prominence in the United States when Andrew Carnegie requested a small keg of Dewar's Scotch whisky be sent to the White House for President James Garfield's inauguration. Carnegie also sent the same gift to President Benjamin Harrison on his inauguration eight years later.

It was originally performed by Ethel Merman. It is sung by the main character Annie after Sitting Bull adopts her into the Sioux tribe. It is typical of mid-20th-century views of Native Americans, and is sometimes considered racist and demeaning from a contemporary perspective, although others see it as a mildly satirical attack on racial stereotyping. Native Americans did protest outside the New York theatre, as well as movie theaters, holding picket signs stating: \\"Don't See \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\". As a result of this reaction, many contemporary productions have omitted the song from their revivals, and the protests stopped. In 1979, the song was remixed and released as a dance track by disco artist Don Armando.

Nghia- Sinh has also provided food, clothes, shelter, and medicine to war victims since 1966. Between 1968 and 1975, Nghia-Sinh established the Nghia-Viet High School for the poor; Hung-Vuong Social Service Center for homeless children; Tran-Binh-Trong Shelter for displaced persons; and Chanh-Hung Human Care Program for juvenile delinquents. Nghia-Sinh served thousands of people for 12 years in Vietnam.

From 1975 to 1987, Nghia-Sinh resettled over 1,000 such refugees in Illinois. On some occasions, this resettlement work was carried out solely by unpaid volunteers. At other times Nghia-Sinh had subcontracts from the U.S. State Department/AFCR. These funds were used partly for providing direct financial assistance to newly arrived refugees and partly for paying part-time staff. This resettlement work involved airport pickups; food and housing for the first thirty days; escort; link-up with social security; access to health clinics, schools, and public aid; access and linkage to previously resettled Indochinese refugees. Each refugee received $250 in cash upon arrival. In addition, each refugee and every refugee sponsored by Nghia-Sinh received $50 as a wedding gift and $50 for family funeral assistance. Over 70 percent of the refugees are now working. More than 20 percent are attending colleges while another 10 percent are taking retirement. On Thanksgiving each year, refugees sponsored by Nghia-Sinh get together to thank God for His blessing, to share life experience with one another, and to celebrate with an Asian American dinner together. Beginning in 1987, Nghia-Sinh started to address the issue of youth problems such as school dropouts, drugs, gangs, and crimes through its prevention programs. Nghia-Sinh also offered cross-cultural workshops, individual counseling sessions, after-school programs, and martial arts classes, among other programs.

The magazine ceased publication in the spring of 2010. The magazine offered extensive reviews of folk music recordings, videos, books, and concerts as well as in depth profiles of musical artists and venues. They also maintained a schedule of concerts and festivals of folk music performances in North America in their \\"gig guide\\" which was available within the magazine or through their web site. Other features included, \\"The Horse Trader\\" classified ads, and a \\"Wireless\\" discussion of whats on the air waves. History Dirty Linen originated in 1983 as a publication titled Fairport Fanatics, a fan magazine for the British band Fairport Convention created by T.J. McGrath of Fairfield, Connecticut. In 1987 Paul Hartman took over as editor and publisher, renamed the magazine Dirty Linen. \\"Dirty Linen\\" was the title of a traditional tune, arranged as an instrumental by Dave Swarbrick on Fairport Convention's 1970 album, Full House. The publication expanded its scope to cover genres of rooted music from many countries and cultures. Based in Baltimore, Maryland, the magazine grew with direction from Hartman and his wife, Susan, who also served as co-editor of the magazine for many years. The photocopied fanzine became a glossy color publication in the early 1990s. Dirty Linen began international distribution and gained sales in North American chains such as Borders Books & Music, Barnes & Noble, and Chapters.  2007 merger with VisioNation  In September 2007, Dirty Linen announced a merger with VisioNation, Inc., publishers of Blues Revue and the e-zines BluesWax and FolkWax. The merger was greeted enthusiastically by both parties who announced plans for new projects for Dirty Linen such as the inclusion of a sampler CD for subscribers, and planned growth for all four of VisioNation's roots music publications, including entry into radio and cable markets and sponsorship of music festivals. In April 2010, Paul and Sue Hartman left Dirty Linen and VisioNation. Dirty Linen canceled their March/April and May/June 2010 issues.

It was recorded in his home bedroom with a 4-track recorder and Chesnutt playing guitar, bass, keyboard, and the organ. A 36-song double album, The Headphone Masterpiece features neo soul and lo-fi music, and distorted, overdubbed production. It was written and arranged by Chesnutt, whose mix of ironic and sincere lyrics reflect on personal experiences such as falling in love with his wife and reconciling his love for rock and roll with the drawbacks of the rock lifestyle. After unsuccessfully shopping the album to record companies, Chesnutt released it himself on his website in September 2002 before releasing it on September 24 through his own label Ready, Set, Go!. The album charted for one week on the Billboard 200 and had sold 25,000 copies by March 30, 2003, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The Headphone Masterpiece was well received by music critics, who found it musically adventurous, albeit indulgent.  Recording and production  Sony MDR-7506 headphones, used as a studio monitor for the recording After his band The Crosswalk was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months recording The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom, which he used as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track recorder, and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor in order not to wake up his roommate. The album was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.  Music and lyrics  A 36-song double album, The Headphone Masterpiece has overdubbed, distorted production, and incorporates pop rock, soul, R&B;, and hip hop styles. Music journalist Philip Sherburne said that it explores British Invasion music on songs such as \\"Upstarts in a Blowout\\", synthpop on \\"The World Is Coming to My Party\\", and \\"cheerfully misogynist\\" hip hop on \\"Bitch, I'm Broke\\", but the album's \\"core is classic soul\\". Jared Levy from Tiny Mix Tapes called it a neo soul album, while The Fader magazine's Knox Robinson categorized it as lo-fi music. Chesnutt's lyrics mix irony and sincerity. He wrote the album to express the complexity of his personal experiences, such as falling in love with his wife, rock and roll, and reconciling his love for the music with the trappings of the rock lifestyle. Pitchfork journalist Rob Mitchum wrote that \\"Serve This Royalty\\" celebrates Chesnutt's \\"cultural sect\\", and \\"The Seed\\" mixes his \\"hypersexual egotism\\" with \\"a tone of evolutionary bravado.\\" On the former song, Chesnutt sings \\"Thank you Jesus / For my mama / Thank you bitches / For my money\\". He said of recording the song, \\"I woke up, went to the organ, and played these chords\\". Following \\"Bitch, I'm Broke\\", the album features a suite of songs written about Chesnutt's wife and the pleasures of monogamy.  Marketing and sales  Chesnutt shopped the album around to record companies, but they mistook it for a demo and rejected it. They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly, rearrange the drums, and rerecord his vocals. He said in an interview for Vibe at the time, \\"I refuse to re-record it-that defeats the purpose. What about the experience I had in my bedroom? To go back to the studio, I'd be chasing something. If you're listening to it and you love it, then it's already done what it's supposed to do.\\" In September 2002, Chesnutt made the album available through his website, and released it on September 24 on his own label Ready, Set, Go! Chesnutt performed at clubs in Los Angeles in the album's promotion. He subsequently toured with Macy Gray, Erykah Badu, and The Roots, who covered his song \\"The Seed\\" on their 2002 album Phrenology. The band released a music video for the song featuring Chesnutt, which received airplay on MTV. Consequently, The Headphone Masterpiece entered the Billboard 200 at number 128 with sales of 8,000 copies. By March 30, 2003, it had sold 25,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It spent one week on the Billboard 200.  Critical reception  The Headphone Masterpiece was well received by most critics. Reviewing the album in Rolling Stone, Tom Moon hailed it as \\"one of the most emotionally raw albums of the year\\" and a record that \\"gathered musical strands from all over the pop universe into unadorned, remarkably intimate stream-of-consciousness musings on love, money and responsibility\\". AllMusic's Mike Gowan called it a \\"lo-fi gem\\" and \\"an eclectic celebration of sound\\", while Uncut said it is \\"an awesome declaration of intent\\" and, \\"although decidedly lo-fi, this epic, adventurous and mischievous album bears comparison with Prince and Todd Rundgren (at their respective peaks).\\" Matt Diehl from Spin regarded the music as \\"indie soul that traverses the chasm between Shuggie Otis and Guided by Voices\\". Writing for Vibe, Dream Hampton said it is \\"everything that many roots and retro artists have reached for, pure and straightforward; yet it is thoroughly modern in its outlook, inventive and unsentimental, with both feet in the future.\\" Some reviewers expressed reservations. Mojo found the record \\"at once engaging and aloof\\", with \\"its often hamfisted production and errant vocals adding to its ramshackle, rusticated charms\\". In The A.V. Club, Nathan Rabin said the album was \\"musically uneven in the best way\\", calling it \\"a brilliant, self-indulgent, kaleidoscopic, contradictory mess\\". Mitchum from Pitchfork observed \\"a surplus of uniqueness overshadows a respectable aptitude\\" and remarked that its \\"self-indulgence, lack of focus, and unbridled sonic and lyrical crudity\\" makes the album \\"so frustrating, yet compelling.\\" Village Voice critic Robert Christgau cited \\"Family on Blast\\", \\"The World Is Coming to My Party\\", and \\"My Woman, My Guitars\\" as highlights and said the album is \\"just what alt-r&b; needed‚Äîloads of ideas, considerable talent, and all the stern self-discipline of a trust fund baby\\".

A former slave from Tennessee who escaped to freedom in Ontario, Canada in 1846, he soon returned to the United States, settling for a period in Detroit, Michigan. He became a noted abolitionist, community leader, and spokesman for African-American civil rights. Singleton returned to Tennessee during the Union occupation in 1862, but soon concluded that blacks would never achieve economic equality in the white-dominated South. After the end of Reconstruction, Singleton organized the movement of thousands of black colonists, known as Exodusters, to found settlements in the free state of Kansas. A prominent voice for early black nationalism, he became involved in promoting and coordinating black-owned businesses in Kansas and developed an interest in the Back-to-Africa movement. Early life and education Although it is known that Benjamin Singleton was born in 1809 into slavery in Davidson County near Nashville, Tennessee, details of his early life remain scant. He was the son of a white father and an enslaved black mother. As a youth, he was trained as a carpenter but regretted never learning to read and write. Reportedly Singleton made several attempts to run away but was unsuccessful. In 1846 Singleton managed to escape to freedom. He made his way north along the Underground Railroad to Windsor, Ontario, and remained there a year before relocating to Detroit, Michigan. In Detroit he lived as a scavenger and used what resources he could to help other escaped slaves find their way to freedom in Canada. Singleton lived in Detroit until after the Civil War was underway. During this time, he worked as a carpenter. Separatism After the Union Army occupied Middle Tennessee in 1862, Singleton returned and took up residence in Nashville, Tennessee, believing his freedom would be protected within Union lines. He worked as a cabinetmaker and coffin maker. Bobby L. Lovett, Benjamin \\"Pap\\" Singleton, Tennessee State University Library. As freedmen were still subject to white racial violence and political problems, Singleton concluded that blacks would have no chance for equality in the South. Disgusted by political leaders who failed to deliver on promises of equality for freedmen, in 1869 Singleton joined forces with Columbus M. Johnson, a black minister in Sumner County, and began looking for ways to establish black economic independence. In 1874, Singleton and Johnson founded the Edgefield Real Estate Association, with the goal of helping African Americans acquire land in the Nashville area. White landowners were unwilling to bargain with them and wanted too high prices for their land. Convinced that freedmen must leave the South to achieve true economic independence, in 1875 Singleton began to explore the idea of planting black colonies in the American West. His real estate organization was renamed the Edgefield Real Estate and Homestead Association. In 1876 Singleton and Johnson traveled to Kansas to scout land in Cherokee County in the southeastern corner of the state. Heartened by what he saw, Singleton returned to Nashville and began recruiting settlers for a proposed colony. Singleton colonies In the summer of 1877, Singleton led approximately seventy-three black settlers to Cherokee County near the town of Baxter Springs.Entz, \\"Image and Reality on the Kansas Prairie\\", Kansas History 19 (Summer 1996): 138‚Äì139. Once the settlers arrived, they began negotiating with the Missouri River, Fort Scott, and Gulf Railroad for land to build their proposed Singleton Colony. Their timing was late, as rich lead deposits had been discovered in the area the previous year, which led to a mining boom and caused land prices to rise too high for their funds. Without the ability to buy land, they could not create a colony in Cherokee County. Singleton began looking elsewhere. He searched for government land which his settlers could acquire through the 1862 Homestead Act. He found some available land on what had been the former Kaw Indian Reservation near the town of Dunlap, Kansas, on the borders of Morris and Lyon counties. Dunlap was situated along the tracks of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, familiarly called the Katy Railroad, which extended into Kansas from Missouri. The land was marginal, but in the spring of 1878, Singleton's settlers left middle Tennessee for Kansas via steamboats on the Cumberland River. The following year they officially established the Dunlap Colony. More than 2400 settlers emigrated from the Nashville and Sumner County areas. Most settlers lived in dugouts during their first year on the Great Plains. They stuck it out and made the colony a success. Exodusters, 1879‚Äì80 By 1879 of the \\"Great Exodus\\", 50,000 freedmen known as Exodusters had migrated from the South to escape poverty and racial violence following whites' regaining political control across the former Confederacy. They migrated to Kansas, Missouri, Indiana and Illinois seeking land, better working conditions, and the chance to live in peace. Part of Topeka, Kansas, was known as \\"Tennessee Town\\" because of many migrants from that state. Most had no direct connection with Singleton's organized colony movement, but Singleton and his followers were sympathetic to their plight. Many white Kansans began to object to the arrival of so many desperately poor blacks into their state. Singleton stepped forward to defend the Exodusters' right to try to make better lives in the American West. In 1880 Singleton was requested to appear before the United States Senate in Washington, D.C., to testify on the causes of the Great Exodus to Kansas. Singleton rebuffed the efforts of southern Senators to discredit the Exodus Movement. He testified to his own success in setting up independent black colonies and noted the terrible conditions which caused freedmen to leave the South. Singleton returned to Kansas as a nationally recognized spokesman for the Exodusters. But the migration of so many poor blacks put more of a financial burden on the Dunlap Colony than the original settlers could bear. By 1880, the Presbyterian Church had taken charitable control of the settlement; it planned to build a Freedmen's Academy in the town. Singleton had no more dealings with his colony at Dunlap. Final years In 1881, Singleton was 72 years old, and most people referred to him affectionately as \\"old Pap.\\" He was still a formidable figure and used his reputation to bring together blacks into an organization called the Colored United Links (CUL). The goal of the CUL, which he created in Topeka, was to combine the financial resources of all black people to build black-owned businesses, factories, and trade schools. The CUL formed in 1881 and held several conventions. The organization was successful enough locally that Republican Party officials in Kansas became interested in its potential political strength. Presidential candidate James B. Weaver of the Greenback Party met with CUL leaders, to discuss fusion between the two groups. After 1881, CUL membership faltered, however, and the organization soon fell apart. After the failure of the CUL, Singleton became convinced that blacks would never be allowed to succeed in the United States. In 1883 he briefly joined with Joseph Ware a St. Louis, Missouri, businessman, and John Williams, a black minister, in proposing that American blacks migrate to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. That idea was not developed. In 1885 Singleton moved to Kansas City, where he began to organize around Pan-Africanism. In 1885 he founded the United Transatlantic Society (UTS), with the goal of having all blacks relocate from the United States to Africa, where such Western- influenced colonies as Sierra Leone and Liberia had been founded by Great Britain and the United States, respectively. In this time period, Bishop Henry McNeil Turner also had his own proposed African migration movement. The UTS lasted till 1887 but never sent anyone to Africa. In poor health, Singleton retired from his life of activism. He raised his voice one final time in 1889 to call for a portion of the newly opening Oklahoma Territory to be reserved as an all-black state.

Sabini is the former chairman of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board. He was confirmed by the New York State Senate in August 2008 and served until 2013. Sabini had previously been a member of the State Senate, a Democrat, serving from 2003 to 2008, and represented parts of Jackson Heights, Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst and Woodside. He had previously represented much of the same area as a member of New York City Council from 1992 to 2001. Early life A lifelong resident of Jackson Heights, Sabini won election to the Community Advisory Board at Elmhurst Hospital at age 16. When he was 19, he was appointed to Community Board No. 3-Q, where he served until his election to the City Council. Sabini holds a degree from New York University's College of Business and Public Administration, now known as the Stern School, and attended its Graduate School of Public Administration, now known as the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Sabini served as District Administrator for Congressmen James H. Scheuer and Stephen J. Solarz. He also served as Director of the State Assembly's Subcommittee on Senior Citizen Facilities. Prior to his election to the City Council, Sabini was Vice President of the MWW Group, a public and government relations firm based in New Jersey. Career The crisis surrounding the Queens County Democratic Organization following the death of Donald Manes in 1986 was a defining moment in Sabini's career. Sabini was thrust into the position of interim chairman at the time when scrutiny from the media and federal investigators threatened the future of the local party organization. His success in stepping in to clean up the party earned him glowing editorial support from The New York Times and Newsday. After completing the unexpired term he was replaced by Congressman Thomas J. Manton after that year's primary election.  City Council  On the City Council, Sabini held the post of Council representative to the City's Commission on Public Information and Communications, a panel seeking ways to improve interaction between New York City residents and city government and increased use of technology. He was appointed Chair of the Council's Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Siting and Maritime Uses and was chosen for membership on the Council's influential Land Use Committee and on the Subcommittee on Planning, Dispositions and Concessions. In his legislative duties, he introduced and co-sponsored many bills that have helped to improve the quality of life for New Yorkers, including the Aggressive Panhandling bill and the Landmark Notification Law, which requires the commercial tenants doing business in historic districts be informed about their responsibilities under the city's landmarks law.  NYS Senate  When the newly configured 13th Senate District was unveiled in the spring of 2002, Sabini became a candidate who amassed broad support within the Democratic Party. In 2004 and 2006 he was the Democratic nominee and was re-elected in the general election. Upon joining the Senate, Sabini received several high-profile appointments unprecedented for a new member. He was appointed as the ranking member of the Elections Committee and was the Senate Democratic conferee on a conference committee designed to set up the state's framework to comply with the federal Help America Vote Act. Sabini was also appointed to the Rules Committee, the first freshman Democrat since 1937 to serve in that capacity. In his first term, he introduced the bill that established by law the Flight 587 Memorial Scholarship, honoring the victims of that flight that crashed on the way to the Dominican Republic. He later introduced a bill -- which also later passed into law -- to prevent the scheduling of statewide exams during major religious holidays. In 2006, Sabini was appointed as Assistant Minority Leader for Intergovernmental Affairs. He served as the liaison between the Senate Minority Conference and the Governor's office, the State Assembly, Congress and local governments. Sabini simultaneously maintained his ranking membership status on the Transportation and Racing, Gaming & Wagering Committees. Sabini was also appointed to several high-profile panels in 2006. In February he served as the only New York State representative on a national transportation leadership summit at the White House. In April he served as the only New York City legislator on Governor Eliot Spitzer's special panel to determine the future of thoroughbred racing in New York and the operations of Belmont Park, Aqueduct Racetrack, and Saratoga Race Course. Driving while ability impaired On September 27, 2007, Albany police pulled over Sabini. He failed a field-sobriety test and declined to take a Breathalyzer. Sabini pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while ability impaired. He paid a $300 fine, agreed to enroll in DWI classes, and his driver's license was suspended for six months. End of State Senate term Queens County Democratic party officials declined to support Sabini for re-election in 2008. Instead, 12 of the 14 members of the party's county executive Committee gave their support to Hiram P. Monserrate, citing Monserrate's strength in the 2006 election and the changing ethnic politics of the district that were increasingly favorable to the challenger. New York State Racing and Wagering Board Sabini resigned his Senate seat to accept a nomination by Governor Paterson to become head of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board. Monserrate then won the Democratic primary nomination and was elected to the Senate.

The Vijayanagara Empire rose to power in southern India in the 14th century CE. Over the past decades historians have expressed differing opinions on whether the empire's founders, Harihara I and Bukka I (two of four sons of Sangama), were of Kannada or Telugu origin. There are various opinions about role of the Vidyaranya, the Hindu saint and guru of Harihara I and Bukka I in the founding of the Vijayanagara empire. Kannadiga origin theory Scholars such as Rothermund, B.L Rice, P.B. Desai, Saletore, Henry Heras, Suryanatha Kamath, Karmakar and S.K. Aiyangar claim that the founders of the Vijayanagara Empire were Kannadigas and related to the Hoysala dynasty.P.B. Desai, B.A. Saletore, Henry Heras and Kamath in Kamath (2001), p158Karmarkar (1947), p30Kulke and Rothermund (2004), p188G.S.Gai and S.K. Aiyangar in Durga Prasad, p191Rice (1897), p345 E. W. West opines the founders were officers in the army of Veera Ballala III, the last Hoysala king.West (1877), p.637 Though controversies over the role of Vidyaranya in the founding of the empire exist, it is well accepted that he was an important individual at the powerful Shringeri monastic order, though he became the head of the order around 1380, a few decades after the founding of the empire.Several grants were made by the founders Harihara I and Bukka I to the Shringeri monastery in 1346 and Vidyaranya did use his influence to secure critical financial support for the brothers of the Sangama dynasty (Kamat 2001, p160-161)Vidyaranya's blessings and proximity, and the influence of monastic order of Shringeri helped in providing legitimacy to the founding kings of a new empire (Kulke and Rothermund 2004, p188) According to these historians, modern epigraphic research and interpretation of these inscriptions (not available to earlier historians) support the theory that the founders of the empire were local princes under the service of the last of the Hoysala king. According to them, inscriptions prove that Harihara I and Bukka Raya I were in the Hoysala service a decade before their arrival at Kampili (in modern Bellary district).Quote:\\"The founding king was an officer under King Ballala\\" (West 1877, p637)Quote: \\"native Kannadigas by origin\\" (Karmarkar 1947, p30) Not only did the widow of Hoysala Veera Ballala III participate in the coronation of Harihara I in 1346, her name appears before that of the founding King Harihara I in a 1349 inscription, indicating he gained legitimacy for being a devoted heir of the Hoysala legacy. Further, according to William Coelho and Heras, it is known that the original founding of the capital Vijayanagara was in 1320 by Veera Ballala III, the city then being known as Vijayavirupaksha Hosapattana.Quote:\\"According to William Coelho and Henry Heras\\" (Kamath 2001, p129) According to Eaton, By 1344, the transfer of power from the Hoysala Empire to the emerging Vijayanagara Empire seems to have been gradual and without bloodshed, as ex-Hoysala officers melted away from a crumbling Hoysala power to support the Sangama cause.Eaton (2006), p42 Historian Kamath argues that in 1346, Harihara I made a grant to Bharati Tirtha, the Shringeri pontiff in the presence of Krishnayitayi, queen of the slain Hoysala king Veera Ballala III (who herself made a grant on the same day). Harihara I was a commander in the Hoysala Kingdom and had been appointed by Veera Ballala III with autonomous powers after the fall of the Seuna (Yadava dynasty) and Kampili kingdoms, to administer the northern territories. Also, the very first fortification that Harihara I built was at Barakuru in coastal Karnataka in 1336. He was a Hoysala commander in charge of its northern territories from his seat in Gutti (modern Ananthapur district of Andhra Pradesh), at that time a Hoysala territory.Kamath (2001), p160-161 He assumed the Kannada titles Purvapaschima Samudradhishvara (lit, \\"Master of eastern and western and oceans\\"), Arirayavibhada (lit, \\"fire to the enemy kings\\") and Bhashegetappuvarayaraganda (lit, \\"punisher of the ruler who failed to keep a promise\\"). According to Kamath, when Veera Ballala III died fighting the Sultan of Madurai, Harihara I seems to have gained sovereign powers over the entire Hoysala territory.Ibn Batuta gave a graphic description of his end of Veera Ballala III. The greatest hero in the dark political atmosphere of South India (Kamath 2001, p130). The historian Saletore pointed out that even famous Telugu scholars such as Vallabharaya and Srinatha called the Sangama brothers Karnata Kshitinatha in their writings, indicating they were a Kannada family. An early inscription of Harihara II called him \\"Lion to the scent elephant of the Andhra king\\", demonstrating their anti-Telugu propensity.Saletore in Kamath (2001), p159. Saletore wrote Social and political life in Vijayanagar Empire, 1934 According to the epigraphist and historian P.B. Desai, the Persian author Ferishta of the Vijayanagara days wrote of the emperors \\"Roies of Karnataka\\".Desai in Kamath (2001), p159 According to Kamath, the Kannada writings of that time such as Chikkadevaraya Vamshavali and Keladinripa Vijayam claim that the Sangama brothers were Kannadigas by linguistic affinity, making them people of KarnatakaKamath (2001), p159 Regarding the earliest modern work written on the history of the Vijayanagara Empire by Robert Sewell (A Forgotten Empire, 1901) Kamath claims that Sewell had not used all sources but had copiously used travelogues and other works written by only European travelers to forward his theories.Kamath (2001), p158 Kamath points out that almost half of the Vijayanagar Empire inscriptions, out of a total of 7,000 available to us, are in Kannada. The Kings used titles such as Bhashegetappuva rayara ganda, Moorurayaraganda and Arirayadatta which are pure Kannada language titles. Their remaining inscriptions are in Sanskrit, Telugu, and Tamil.Kamath (2001), p157G.S. Gai in According to Appadurai, The \\"Karnataka Empire\\" or Vijayanagar Empire was originally of the Karnataka region and it drew its inspirations from the Hoysala Empire and the Western Ganga Dynasty of the Karnataka and the Chola and Pandya of the Tamil country.Appadurai in The Place of Kannada and Tamil in Indias National culture (INTAMM 1997). According to Henry Heras, inscriptional evidence shows that Ballappa Dandanayaka, a nephew of Hoysala Veera Ballala III was married to a daughter of Harihara I, the founding king of the empire. This is claimed proof enough of the association Sangama brothers had with the Hoysala family.Heras in Kamath (2001), p159. Heras wrote Aravidu Dynasty of Vijayanagar Empire, 1927 According to the historians Saletore, P.B. Desai and Henry Heras, the theory of capture of Harihara I and Bukka Raya I by the Sultan of Delhi and conversion to Islam is false and that the testimony of epigraphs proves that the area around Hampi constituted their homeland. The empire never had a Telugu origin. The patron saint of the early kings was saint Vidyaranya, the 12th Shankaracharya of Sringeri in Karnataka, and this is proof enough of their unquestionable identity with the Kannada country. About the Muslim records that claim a Telugu origin of Harihara I and Bukka Raya, these historians feel, the records are neither unanimous nor reliable in their claims. In those days of religious rigidity, it is too far-fetched to accept a theory of conversion to Islam and re-conversion to Hinduism while still managing to win the trust and loyalty of Hindu subjects in an hour of impending invasions.Desai, Saletore and Henry Heras in Kamath 2001, p158 According to Kamath, the great devotion the founders of the empire had in Lord Chennakeshava of Belur and Lord Virupaksha of Hampi testifies to their origin from Kannada country, though in political and administrative matters, the Vijayanagar kings followed the Hoysala, Kakatiya, Chola framework in the various provincial regions of the empire. The Sangama brothers even signed their Sanskrit records in Kannada (as Srivirupaksha) and used their Kannada titles even in their Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit records. No Telugu titles were used by them.Kamath (2001), p159 A popular chieftain and patriot of those times, prince Kumara Rama of Kummata Durga or simply Kummata Durga (capital of the tiny Kampli kingdom in Bellary District) may have been related to Sangama, father of Harihar I. This evidence exists in a literary piece by poet Nanjunda (Kumara Rama Charita). According to Kamath, the early Vijayanagar kings raised memorials at Sandur, Chitradurga and Dharwad to sing the glory of Kumara Rama's valor and show their continued efforts to build an empire in his legacy. All this proves the matrimonial relations the Sangama family had with the Kummata family.Kamath (2001), p159 Aiyangar opines that since the Kakatiya dynasty collapsed about 20 years before the demise of Veera Ballala III of Hoysala Empire in 1342 CE, and Hosapattana was established as a second capital by Veera Ballala III (which eventually became the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire) it would be impossible for Harihara, the founder of fledgling empire to attain such a high position in a short time without having close ties to Hoysala Empire. Telugu origin theory Historians such as Robert Sewell, Dallapiccola, M.H. Ramasarma, Y. Subbarayalu, N. Venkataramanayya and B. Suryanarain Rao have attested the Telugu origin of Vijayanagar empire.Robert Sewell, A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A contribution to the history of India, Chapter 2 (https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/fevch10.txt)Rubies, J.

The book mentioned that the founders of Vijayanagar were Harihara and Bukka, and that they were guards of the treasury of the Kakatiya King Prataparudra of Warangal.Francis Buchanan, Travels in Southern India, Mysore, vol. III, East India Company, London, 1807, Buchanan, p. 110 The brothers met a spiritual teacher called Vidyaranya, the sage of Sringeri monastery, who guided them to establish the Kingdom of Vijayanagar to safeguard the Hindu religion. This was in 1336 and Harihara was made first king of the fledgling empire.J. R.

The Delhi Sultan who captured and converted the brothers to Islam, sent them back to put down the rebellion of Hoysala king.Durga Prasad, \\"History of the Andhras\\" They succeeded in suppressing the rebellion but laid foundation of an independent kingdom at the behest of Vidyaranya.B. Stein, Vijayanagara, Cambridge University Press, 1989, p. 141, Historians Venkataramanayya and Ramasarma supported the conclusions of Sewell based on his research and the information provided by the Sanskrit and Kannada treatises such as Vidyaranya Kalajnana (in Sanskrit), Vidyaranya Vrittanta, Rajakalanirnaya, Piramahasamhiti and Sivatatva Ratnakara (all in Kannada).N. Venkataramanayya, The Early Muslim expansion in south India, University of Madras Press, Madras, 1942M. H. Ramasarma, The History of the Vijayanagar Empire, Vol. I, Bombay According to the scholar Suryanarain Rao, who described seven traditional accounts of the origin of Harihara and Bukka, five were inclined towards a Telugu origin of the founding kings.History of Vijayanagar: The Never to be Forgotten Empire, Bangalore Suryanarain Row, 1993, Asian Educational Services, p. 23; According to Sreenivasa Rao, the Telugu Golla identity of Harihara and Bukka and their devotion to the goddess Bhuvaneswari is also established.B. V. Sreenivasa Rao, Notes on Vijayanagara, Journal of the Andhra Historical Research Society, Vol. 25, 1958‚Äì60, pp. 155‚Äì177 According to Subbarayalu, indirect evidences such as the employment of predominantly Telugu Nayaks (Kamma, Balija, Velama and Reddy people) for revenue collection throughout the empire also supported their Telugu affinity.Y. Subbarayalu, \\"The Revenue System of the Vijayanagara State\\", The Vijayanagara Heritage, Ed. Ramamurthy J.R, Sri Vidya Vijayanagara Hampi Heritage Trust, Anegondi, Hospet, 1996, pp. 75‚Äì80 According to Gribble, Muslim scholars of the time, such as Ziauddin Barani, Isarni and Ferishta and foreign visitors such as Ibn Batuta and Nuniz also recorded that the Sangama brothers were serving King Prataparudra and were taken captive after the fall of Warangal.J. D. B. Gribble, History of the Deccan, 1896, Luzac and Co., London According to B.R. Gopal, who based his research on evidence gleaned from inscriptions such as the Gozalavidu record, the founders of Vijayanagara were at first in the service of the last Kakatiya king Prataparudra of Warangal. When that monarch was defeated by Muhammad bin Tughluq and taken prisoner, they fled to Kampili and took refuge in the court of Kampilideva.B. R. Gopal, \\"The Gozalavidu Inscription of Bukkaraya\\", Journal of the Karnataka University, Vol. 7, Dharwad, 1971, pp. 174‚Äì183 Venkataramanayya states that on the outbreak of a rebellion in Kampili the brothers were sent by Tughlaq with an army to Kampili to reconquer it from the rebels and rule the province as his deputies.N.

Somesekhara Sarma, they successfully suppressed the rebellion, but under the influence of Vidyaranya renounced Islam and threw in their lot with the Andhra nationalists led by Musunuri Nayaks who had just then succeeded under the leadership of Kaapaya Nayaka in expelling the Muslims and re-establish the national independence.M. Somasekhara Sarma, A Forgotten Chapter of Andhra History, 1945, Andhra University, Waltair Professor Nilakanta Shastri claims that Harihara and Bukka then reverted to their ancient faith and having declared independence, assumed the leadership of the Hindus of Kampili in their fight against the Muslims.K. A. Nilakanta Sastri and N. Venkataramanayya; Further Sources of Vijayanagara History, 1946, Vol. II, University of Madras, Madras According to Venkataramanaya, Kaapaya and Bukka had actively collaborated with each other to ward off the Muslim threat, probably because of their close association in the court of Warangal. He surmised that the establishment of Vijayanagar kingdom drew inspiration from the successful exploits of Musunuri Kapaya Nayak.N. Venkataramanayya, The Early Muslim Expansion in South India, 1942, University of Madras Press, Madras Other theories of origin A popular account says that the Hampi region was part of a Kampili kingdom in the 14th century when large parts of north India was under Muslim rule. In 1326 AD Muhammad bin Tughluq defeated and killed the king of Kampili. Among those taken prisoner were sons of Sangama, Hakka (Harihara I) and Bukka (Bukka Raya), both treasury officers of Kampili who were forced to convert to Islam. Some years later the brothers were sent back to govern Kampili. In 1336, The brothers laid the foundation of an independent kingdom, denying any subordination to the Tughluqs and became Hindu again.Hampi ‚Äì A Travel Guide, 2003, p27 NotesReferences * Suryanath U.

The device consists of a tube which is thick on one end and very thin on the other. The thin end is designed to act as a capillary tube. The tube is half-filled with mercury with a small amount of dilute sulfuric acid above the mercury in the capillary tube. Metal wires are connected at the thick end into the mercury and at the thin end into the sulfuric acid. When the pulse of electricity arrives it changes the surface tension of the mercury and allows it to leap up a short distance in the capillary tube.

The gestor is only entitled to reimbursement for expenses and not to remuneration, the underlying principle being that negotiorum gestio is intended as an act of generosity and friendship and not to allow the gestor to profit from his intermeddling. This form of intervention is classified as a quasi-contract and found in civil-law jurisdictions and in mixed systems (e.g. Louisiana, Scots, South African, and Philippine laws). For example, while you are traveling abroad, a typhoon hits your home town and the roofing of your house is in danger. To avoid the catastrophic situation, your neighbour does something urgently necessary. You are the 'principal' and your neighbour here is the 'gestor', the act of which saved your house is the negotiorum gestio. It originated as a Roman legal institution in which an individual acted on behalf of another, without his asking and without remuneration. It was considered a part of officium (duty), for instance, to defend a friend's or neighbour's interests while the friend or neighbour was away.J.A. Crook, Law and Life of Rome (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press), 236‚Äì37. The principal, or dominus negotii (or rarely dominus negotiorum dominus rei gestae), is bound to indemnify the gestor for the expenses and liabilities incurred. If the principal fails to do so, there is unjust enrichment, and the gestor then has a claim to bring an action for restitution. In Napoleonic civilian jurisdictions, including Louisiana, the action takes the form of the actio de in rem verso. In South Africa, on the other hand, multiple restitutionary actions lie for negotiorum gestio, namely: # condictio indebiti; # condictio causa data causa non secuta; # condictio ob turpem vel iniustam causam; # condictio sine causa specialis Negotiorum gestio is not recognised at common law, despite certain English salvage cases, as well as some cases in equity where trustees were on occasion remunerated for services voluntarily rendered.Jeroen Kortmann, Altruism in Private Law: Liability for Nonfeasance and Negotiorum Gestio (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2005).

The prospective short-circuit current which can occur under short circuit conditions should not exceed the rated breaking capacity of the apparatus, otherwise breaking of the current cannot be guaranteed. The current breaking capacity corresponds to a certain voltage, so an electrical apparatus may have more than one breaking capacity current, according to the actual operating voltage. Breaking current may be stated in terms of the total current or just in terms of the alternating-current (symmetrical) component. Since the time of opening of a fuse or switch is not coordinated with the reversal of the alternating current, in some circuits the total current may be offset and can be larger than the alternating current component by itself.Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition,McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, , page 10-64 A device may have different interrupting ratings for alternating and direct current. Choosing breaking capacity Calculation of the required breaking capacity involves determining the supply impedance and voltage. Supply impedance is calculated from the impedance of the elements making up the supply system. Customers of an electrical supply utility can request the maximum value of prospective short- circuit current available at their point of supply. Networks involving multiple sources of current, such as multiple generators, electric motors, and with variable interconnections may be analyzed with a computer. A system study will generally consider the maximum case of additions of generation and interconnection out to some projected horizon year, to allow for system growth during the useful life of the studied installation. Since practical calculations involve a number of approximations and estimates, some judgment is required in applying the results of a short-circuit calculation to the selection of apparatus.IEEE Standard 141-1993, page 113 Making capacity i.e. maximum fault current , device can carry, if it is closed in to the fault should be considered. Breaking capacities Miniature circuit breakers and fuses may be rated to interrupt as little as 85 amperes and are intended for supplementary protection of equipment, not the primary protection of a building wiring system. In North American practice, approved general-purpose low-voltage fuses must interrupt at least 10,000 amperes. Types used in commercial and industrial low-voltage distribution systems are rated to safely interrupt 200,000 amperes. The rating of power circuit breakers varies according to the application voltage; a circuit breaker that interrupts 50,000 amperes at 208 volts might be rated to interrupt only 10,000 amperes at 600 volts, for example. Direct-current systems such as are typical with batteries are more of a problem than alternating current systems, because in the latter current regularly crosses the zero-point, whereas DC current by definition does not.

Biography  Ann Downer was born in Arlington, Virginia in 1960 and grew up in Manila and Bangkok and recalled avidly reading fantasy fiction. Her first published work was a trilogy published in the late 1980s and early 1990s (The Spellkey, The Glass Salamander, and The Books of the Keepers), collected in a revised edition in 1995 as The Spellkey Trilogy. A second series for middle- grade readers, begun in 2003 with the novel Hatching Magic, continues with The Dragon of Never-Was (2006). The Spellkey series is high fantasy, taking place wholly in an invented world and chronicling a good-versus-evil story of two foundlings, a stableboy and an ostracized seer. Hatching Magic and its sequel, The Dragon of Never-Was, are contemporary fantasies with elements of time travel. The series follows a young girl, Theodora Oglethorpe, as she discovers a world of wizardry and magic. While Downer's books are frequently compared to the work of Patricia A. McKillip and Diana Wynne Jones, she has cited the influence of Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea books and the Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander in shaping her outlook and prose style.

Son of the impresario and hotelier Richard D'Oyly Carte, Rupert inherited the family businesses from his stepmother Helen. After serving in the First World War, he took steps to revitalise the opera company, which had not appeared in central London since 1909, hiring new designers and conductors to present fresh productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas in seasons in the West End. The new productions generally retained the original text and music of the operas. Carte launched international and provincial tours, as well as the London seasons, and he released the first complete recordings of the operas. He also rebuilt the half-century-old Savoy Theatre in 1929, opening the house with a season of Gilbert and Sullivan. As an hotelier, Carte built on his father's legacy, expanding the Savoy Hotel, refreshing the other hotels and restaurants in the Savoy group, including Claridge's and the Berkeley Hotel, and introducing cabaret and dance bands that became internationally famous. He also increased marketing activities, including foreign marketing, of the hotels. P. G. Wodehouse based a character in his novels, Psmith, on a Wykehamist schoolboy whom he identified as Rupert D'Oyly Carte. At his death, Carte passed the opera company and hotels to his only surviving child, Bridget D'Oyly Carte. The Gilbert and Sullivan operas, nurtured by Carte and his family for over a century, continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond. Life and career Rupert's father, Richard D'Oyly Carte Early life Rupert D'Oyly Carte was born in Hampstead, London, the younger son of the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte and his first wife Blanche (n√©e Prowse), who died in 1885. Like his elder brother, Lucas (1872‚Äì1907), he was given his father's middle name. He was educated at Winchester College, noted as among the most intellectually rigorous of English public schools.Bishop and Wilkinson, p. 18; and N. Jones, p. 7 He then worked for a firm of accountants before joining his father as an assistant in 1894. In a newspaper interview given in the year of his death, Rupert recalled that as a young man he was entrusted, during his father's illness, with helping W. S. Gilbert with the first revival of The Yeomen of the Guard at the Savoy Theatre.Interview, The New York Post, 7 January 1948 He was elected a director of the Savoy Hotel Limited in 1898, joining his father and Sir Arthur Sullivan, who had served on the board since the Savoy Hotel was built.Ainger, p. 283; and \\"Savoy Hotel\\", The Times, 11 May 1949, p. 8 By 1899 he was assistant managing director.\\"Savoy Hotel Limited\\", The Times, 7 June 1899, p. 6 Richard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901, and Rupert's stepmother, the former Helen Lenoir, who had married Richard in 1888, assumed full control of most of the family businesses, which she had increasingly controlled during her husband's decline. Rupert's brother, Lucas, a barrister, was not involved in the family businesses and died of tuberculosis, aged 34. Taking over the family businesses In 1903, at the age of 27, Rupert took over his late father's role as chairman of the Savoy group, which included the Savoy Hotel, Claridge's, The Berkeley Hotel, Simpson's-in-the-Strand and the Grand Hotel in Rome. At this time, the whole group was officially valued at ¬£2,221,708.\\"Savoy Hotel (Limited)\\", The Times, 21 February 1903, p. 15 He immediately issued ¬£300,000 of debentures to raise capital for a large extension to the Savoy (the \\"East Block\\"). Like his father, Carte was willing to go to great lengths to secure the best employees for his hotels. When Claridge's needed a new chef in 1904, he secured the services of Fran√ßois Bonnaure, formerly chef at the √âlys√©e Palace in Paris. The press speculated on how much Carte must have paid to persuade Bonnaure to join him, and compared the younger Carte's audacity with his father's coup in securing Paris's most famous ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel, M. Joseph, a few years earlier.\\"Profile\\", The Daily Mirror, 10 June 1904, p. 16 Carte in 1919 Between 1906 and 1909, Helen Carte, Rupert's stepmother, staged two repertory seasons at the Savoy Theatre. Directed by Gilbert and received with much success, they revitalised the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which had been in decline after Richard D'Oyly Carte's death.Carte, pp. 6‚Äì7 In 1912, when theatre censorship was under discussion in Britain, Carte was strongly in favour of retaining censorship, because it gave managements complete certainty about what they could or could not stage without fear of interference by the police or others. He joined with other London theatre managers, including Herbert Beerbohm Tree, George Edwardes and Arthur Bourchier in signing a petition for the retention of censorship.\\"Theatre Managers and the Censorship: Petition to the King\\", The Times, 1 April 1912, p. 12 In the same year, together with Herbert Sullivan and theatre managers including Beerbohm Tree and Squire Bancroft, Carte was an instigator of a memorial to W. S. Gilbert at Charing Cross.\\"Memorial to Sir W. S. Gilbert\\", The Times, 13 July 1912, p. 11 In 1913, Rupert's stepmother Helen died. She left all her holdings in the Savoy Hotel group, the Savoy Theatre and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to her stepson.\\"Mrs D'Oyly Carte's Will\\". The Times, 26 May 1913, p. 8 Revitalising the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company After London seasons in 1906‚Äì07 and 1908‚Äì09, the opera company did not perform in the West End again until 1919, although it continued to tour in Great Britain. According to the theatre writer H. M. Walbrook, \\"Through the years of the Great War they continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere. They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory.\\"Walbrook, p. 125 Nevertheless, Carte later recalled, \\"I went and watched the Company playing at a rather dreary theatre down in the suburbs of London. I thought the dresses looked dowdy . . . I formed the view that new productions should be prepared, with scenery and dresses to the design of first class artists who understood the operas but who would produce a d√©cor attractive to the new generation.\\"Baily, p. 430.

He, too, has the gift of taking in the details of a scene at a glance, and knowing instinctively just what must be corrected\\".Lytton, p. 66 In 1910 the company engaged J. M. Gordon as stage manager, and Carte promoted him to stage director in 1922. Under Carte's supervision Gordon preserved the company's traditions in exacting detail for 28 years.Stone, David. J. M.

By the end of the war he had reorganised the whole structure of the opera company, assembled new artists and staff and had planned the redressing and restaging of many of the operas. After the war he put his plans into effect. In an interview in The Observer in August 1919 he set out his policy for staging the operas: \\"They will be played precisely in their original form, without any alteration to the words, or any attempt to bring them up to date.\\"\\"Gilbert & Sullivan Revival: Interview with Mr. R. D'Oyly Carte\\", The Observer, 24 August 1919, p. 10 This uncompromising declaration was modified in a later interview in which he said, \\"the plays are all being restaged ... Gilbert's words will be unaltered, though there will be some freshness in the method of rendering them. Artists must have scope for their individuality, and new singers cannot be tied down to imitate slavishly those who made successes in the old days.\\"Bettany, 75th unnumbered page Carte's first London season, at the Prince's Theatre, 1919‚Äì20, featured ten of the thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas. It did not include Ruddigore, Utopia, Limited or The Grand Duke.Rollins and Witts, p. 136 Princess Ida had its first London performances since the original 1883 production.\\"Rupert D'Oyly Carte's Season ‚Ä¶ 1919‚Äì20\\", at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 11 January 2019 The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction. As his father and stepmother had done, Carte licensed the operas to the J. C. Williamson company and to amateur groups, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings.Bradley (2005), pp. 27 and 73 In an interview with The Times in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy \\"tradition\\" was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: \\"It did not by any means imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression. All that it implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production ‚Äì with especial attention to clear enunciation . . . Many people seemed to think that Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case. He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived.\\"\\"Gilbert and Sullivan: Brilliant End to London Season\\", The Times, 10 April 1922, p. 12 Although he had told the press that the original words and music would not be altered, Carte was willing to make changes in certain cases. In 1919‚Äì20, he authorised cuts and alterations in both Princess Ida and Ruddigore. In 1921 Cox and Box was produced in an extensively cut-down version, to allow it to be played as a companion piece with the shortest of the two-act Savoy operas. He also authorised changes to Gilbert's text: he wrote to The Times in 1948: \\"We found recently in America that much objection was taken by coloured persons to a word used twice in The Mikado.\\" The word in question was Gilbert's reference to \\"nigger\\" (blackface) minstrels, and Carte asked A. P. Herbert to suggest an acceptable revision. \\"He made several alternative suggestions, one of which we adopted in America, and it seems well to go on doing so in the British Empire.\\"Carte, Rupert D'Oyly. Letter, The Times 28 May 1945, p. 8. A similar reference in Princess Ida was also altered.Bradley (2016), p. 562 1921 cartoon: D'Oyly Carte audiences Carte commissioned new costumes and scenery throughout his proprietorship of the company. He engaged Charles Ricketts to redesign The Gondoliers and The Mikado, the costumes for the latter, created in 1926, being retained by all the company's subsequent designers. Other redesigns were by Percy Anderson, George Sheringham, Hugo Rumbold and Peter Goffin, a prot√©g√© of Carte's daughter, Bridget. For London seasons, Carte often engaged guest conductors, first Geoffrey Toye, then Malcolm Sargent, who examined Sullivan's manuscript scores and purged the orchestral parts of accretions. So striking was the orchestral sound produced by Sargent that the press thought he had retouched the scores, and Carte had the pleasant duty of correcting their error. In a letter to The Times, he noted that \\"the details of the orchestration sounded so fresh that some of the critics thought them actually new ... the opera was played last night exactly as written by Sullivan.\\"Carte, Rupert D'Oyly, Letter, The Times, 22 September 1926, p. 8 Carte also engaged Harry Norris, who started with the touring company, and then was Toye's assistant before becoming musical director.Rollins and Witts, pp. I and II Isidore Godfrey joined the company as assistant musical director in 1925 and became musical director in 1929, remaining in that post until 1968.Rollins and Witts, pp. II‚ÄìVI; and Joseph, p. 317 The possibilities of the gramophone appealed to Carte. After the First World War he supervised a series of complete recordings of the scores of the operas on the HMV label, beginning with The Mikado in 1918. The first nine HMV sets, made between 1918 and 1925, were recorded by the early acoustic process. At first, guest singers were chosen who were known for their ability to record well in this technology. Later in this series, more of the regular members of the company were featured.Rollins and Witts, pp. X and XI; and Shepherd, Marc. \\"The First D'Oyly Carte Recordings\\", A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 18 November 2001, accessed 21 November 2009 With the introduction of electrical recording and its greatly improved recording process and sound, a new round of recordings began in 1927.Shepherd, Marc. \\"The D'Oyly Carte Complete Electrical Sets\\", A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 18 November 2001, accessed 21 November 2009 For the electrical series, Carte's own singers were mostly used.Rollins and Witts, pp. XI‚ÄìXII Carte also recognised the potential of radio and worked with the BBC to relay live broadcasts of D'Oyly Carte productions. A 1926 relay of part of a Savoy Theatre performance of The Mikado was heard by up to eight million people. The London Evening Standard noted that this was \\"probably the largest audience that has ever heard anything at one time in the history of the world.\\"Reid, p. 137 Under Carte, the company continued to make broadcasts during the interwar years. In 1932, The Yeomen of the Guard became the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be broadcast in its entirety.Webster, Chris. \\"Original D'Oyly Carte Broadcasts\\", A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 16 July 2005, accessed 22 November 2009 Rebuilding the Savoy Theatre and later years In 1929 Carte had the 48-year-old Savoy Theatre rebuilt and modernised. It closed on 3 June 1929 and was gutted and completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with d√©cor by Basil Ionides. The old house had three tiers; the new one had two. The seating capacity (which had decreased to 986 from its original 1,292) was restored nearly completely, to 1,200.\\"Savoy Theatre\\", The Times, 21 October 1929 The theatre reopened 135 days later on 21 October 1929,Savoy Theatre programme note, September 2000 with The Gondoliers, designed by Ricketts and conducted by Sargent.Information about the 1929‚Äì30 season and the new designs, Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 12 November 2009 The critic Ernest Newman wrote, \\"I can imagine no gayer or more exhilarating frame for the Gilbert and Sullivan operas than the Savoy as it is now.\\"quoted in Baily, p. 442 Despite its historical connection with Gilbert and Sullivan, most of Carte's London seasons were staged not at the Savoy but at two larger houses: the Prince's (now the Shaftesbury) Theatre (1919‚Äì20, 1921‚Äì22, 1924, 1926, 1942 and Sadler's Wells (1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1947 and 1948).Rollins and Witts, pp. 136‚Äì72 His three Savoy Theatre seasons were in 1929‚Äì30, 1932‚Äì33, and 1941. In addition to year-round UK tours, Carte mounted tours of North America in 1927, 1928‚Äì29, 1934‚Äì35, 1936‚Äì37, 1939 and 1947‚Äì48).Rollins and Witts, pp. 153‚Äì72 During the 1936 tour an American critic wrote, \\"If there were only some way of keeping them on this side permanently. I humbly suggest to the New Deal that it cancel England's war debt in exchange for the D'Oyly Cartians. We should be much the gainer.\\"The Philadelphia Public Ledger, quoted in Baily, p. 440 Carte was deeply affected by the death of his son Michael in 1932. The actor Martyn Green said, \\"The heart dropped right out of him. His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away.\\" Green, p. 83 Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing Lytton.Wilson and Lloyd, p. 128 Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of The Mikado produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures,Baily, p. 446Shepherd, Marc. \\"The Technicolor Mikado Film (1939)\\", A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography (2001), accessed 20 November 2009 but his only new stage production after 1932 was of The Yeomen of the Guard designed in 1939 by Peter Goffin. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, \\"I don't care what they say about the production. I should care if they said nothing.\\"Baily, p. 19 On 3 September 1939, at the outbreak of the Second World War, the British government ordered the immediate and indefinite closure of all theatres. Carte cancelled the autumn tour and disbanded the company.Joseph, p. 246 Theatres were permitted to reopen from 15 September,\\"Theatres and Cinemas Today\\", The Times, 15 September 1939, p. 8 but it took some weeks to re-form the company. It resumed touring in Edinburgh on Christmas Day 1939, and continued to perform throughout the war.Rollins and Witts, pp. 164‚Äì169 German bombing destroyed the sets and costumes for five D'Oyly Carte productions: Cox and Box, The Sorcerer, H.M.S. Pinafore, Princess Ida and Ruddigore. The old productions of Pinafore and Cox and Box were recreated shortly after the war, but the other two operas took longer to rejoin the company's repertory. Peter Goffin designed and directed the new production of The Yeomen of the Guard first seen in January 1940, and his new Ruddigore debuted in 1948, shortly after Carte's death. A return of the company to the US for 21 weeks in 1947 was very successful.Rollins and Witts, p. 172 Savoy Hotel group From the beginning of his career, Carte maintained the Savoy group in London, disposing in 1919 of the Grand Hotel, Rome, which his father had acquired in 1896.\\"Miscellaneous Companies\\", The Times, 15 July 1896, p. 4; and \\"Savoy Hotel Position\\", The Times, 20 December 1919, p. 18 In the 1920s, he ensured that the Savoy continued to attract a fashionable clientele by a continuous programme of modernisation and the introduction of dancing in the large restaurants.

Whale directed such groundbreaking works as the 1931 Frankenstein and 1933's The Invisible Man and was a pioneer in the horror film genre. In 1998, Ian McKellen played Whale in the film adaptation of Bram's book, titled Gods and Monsters. The story has also been turned into a British play of the same title as the film which premiered in London at the Southwark Playhouse in February 2015. Another play version written for France is rather based on the novel and will be released in 2017. Synopsis James Whale has just had a stroke. He is convinced that his time has come to die. Increasingly confused and disoriented, his mind is overwhelmed by images of the past ‚Äì from his working-class childhood in Britain, the trenches of World War I, and the lavish glamour of Hollywood premieres in the 1930s. Whale asks his new gardener, a Marine veteran named Clayton Boone, to come to his studio for some portrait sittings. Boone is uncomfortable with Whale's homosexuality but also fascinated by the chance to know a famous Hollywood director and so, despite his apprehensions, the relationship continues. Boone begins to think of Whale as a friend. But one night after they return from a Hollywood garden party, Whale makes an advance at Boone, trying to make him so angry that he will kill Whale. The old man wants to die; he wants his death to have a human face, Boone's face. Boone refuses and is very upset. Whale apologizes‚Äìhe knows he is going insane. The next morning, Whale understands that he is ready to cross over, alone. He drowns himself in his backyard swimming pool. ReferencesExternal links * Gods and Monsters?

The doggerel verse is famous for lacking poetic quality.

Hall China is one of two potteries under the HLC Inc. brand, the other being Homer Laughlin China. Hall China continues to succeed as one of the largest manufacturers of specialty dinnerware. Founding The Hall China Company visitor entrance. Hall China was founded on August 14, 1903, by Robert Hall, in the former West, Hardwick and George Pottery facility, following the dissolution of the two-year-old East Liverpool Potteries Company. He began making dinnerware and toilet seats, but soon found that institutional ware such as bedpans, chamber pots and pitchers was more profitable. New glaze process Robert Hall died just a year after launching the company. One of his eight children, Robert Taggart Hall, took over the company and almost immediately began developments to introduce the single-fire process, which had first been used centuries earlier by Chinese potters during their Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). His dream was to change from the two-firing manufacturing method; one firing to harden the ware and a second firing to set the glaze to the ware. With the help of staff chemists and ceramic engineers, Hall experimented from 1904 until 1911, when he and his staff came up with a glaze recipe that worked. The new process fused together the white body, color and glaze when it was fired at a temperature of 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit. The new glazes allowed the creation of brilliant colors never before seen on American china. Hall china expert Harvey Duke lists no fewer than 47 colors developed for the new process, which allowed for rapid expansion of the company and its product selections at the onset of World War I. After tepid sales of its new housewares lines in the 1910s, the company tried designing and selling decorated teapots. Hall China became the largest producer of these products in the world. The teapot business was so successful that the company decided to expand it from the original three designs to a plethora of new shapes and colors. In the 1940s the teapot business began to dwindle. By the 1960s, probably due to the increased preference for coffee by the buying public, teapot sales had fallen to insignificance. Hall continues to be a prominent supplier of commercial restaurant dinnerware. Jewel Tea Company association In the mid-1920s, the directors of Hall China made a decision to associate with the Jewel Tea Company to produce an exclusive line of dinnerware for them. Jewel started using Hall teapots as premiums, and then expanded the promotion to include its own line of distinctive dinnerware and kitchenware. New pieces were introduced by Hall China for Jewel until 1980. Hall China breakfast set including waffle iron, batter bowl, syrup jug, coffee cup with saucer (waffle iron manufactured by ElectraHot of Minneapolis, Minnesota with Hall China insert) Other products In the 1930s, refrigerators became more common and so, a new market was created: refrigerator-ware. Hall produced china pieces for all of the major manufacturers, including Hotpoint, General Electric, Westinghouse and Montgomery Ward. Pieces produced were pitchers, covered or not, china boxes for leftovers, butter and cheese dishes. The Hall pieces either came with the appliance or were offered as accessories to be purchased later. During the mid-20th century, Hall China produced a number of renowned designs including the Ball and Donut jugs and the Nautilus, Donut and Aladdin teapots. Hall China attracted talented designers, with examples being Eva Zeisel's popular \\"Century\\" dinnerware and the even more popular \\"Tomorrow's Classic\\" dinnerware and \\"Zeisel\\" tri-color lines and Donald Schreckengost's cookie jars shaped like owls, casserole dishes shaped like ducks, and teapots shaped like Ronald Reagan and Sherlock Holmes. Manufacture process The manufacture of Hall China begins with a mixture of quartz, feldspar and several different clays. These ingredients are mixed together with water to form a slip. The filtered slip is then pumped into presses to remove the water and leaving filter cakes. The cakes are processed through a pug to remove air, before being shaped by jiggering or jolleying to produce plates and bowls. For items such as teapots, the cakes have water added to them and the resulting slip is poured into moulds and moved through the glazing and firing processes. When completed, the pieces are decorated by hand-painting, decals or printing. Current status The retailing floor at 'The Hall Closet', the company's factory outlet store. Hall China continues in production today. The company has reissued many of its earlier designs, including some that had previously been considered rare, such as the Airflow and Rhythm teapots, the Donut and Streamline jugs, and some of the water servers from the refrigerator-ware lines. To allay concerns from collectors, the reissued products are marked differently and use different colors. Hall China celebrated its 100th birthday in 2003 with the publication of A Centennial History of the Hall China Company by Catherine S. Vodrey. In 2010 Homer Laughlin China Company purchased Hall China.

History The castle was constructed around 1100 as a castle by the cadet branch of the House of Wittelsbach. In 1182, the last Count of Dachau, Konrad III, died without issue and Duke Otto I of Bavaria took possession of it shortly thereafter. The original castle was demolished between 1398 and 1403. In 1467, Sigismund, Duke of Bavaria resigned his rule of Bavaria-Munich and then kept only the new duchy of Bavaria-Dachau as his domain until his death in 1501. William IV of Bavaria and his son Albert V ordered the construction of a Renaissance style four-wing palace with a court garden on the site of the old castle. The new building was designed by Heinrich Sch√∂ttl; construction began in 1546 and was completed in 1577. It later became the favoured residence of the rulers of Bavaria. Also, close to Dachau Palace was the Schleissheim Palace that started out with a renaissance country house (1598) and hermitage founded by William V, Duke of Bavaria. In 1715, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria commissioned a redesign in Baroque style by Joseph Effner. Only the south-west wing is extant; King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria ordered the other 3 wings to be demolished in the early 19th century. They had suffered extensive damage at the hands of Napoleonic troops. Description The Palace is managed by the Bavarian Administration of State-owned Palaces, an administrative department of the Free State of Bavaria. It is open to visitors and the Banqueting Hall can be booked for special events. It is also used as a venue for classical concerts. The stairwell, same as the west facade of 1715 are built in the R√©gence style. The main sight of the palace is the banqueting hall with its coffered Renaissance ceiling, designed and created between 1564 and 1566 by Hans Wisreutter, which was restored to the palace in 1977. The view from the top of the Schlossberg overlooks Munich and extends to the Bavarian Alps. The Park Lime trees in the court garden The court garden was created from the 1572 in order to enjoy the remarkable view from the Schlossberg, several pavilions were built, of which three are still preserved. Comparable with the vineyard and famous Sanssouci Palace, were the \\"hanging gardens\\" of the Schlossberg: terraces with precious espalier fruits. For the upper part of the parterres a still existing balcony of lime trees was created. Joseph Effner re-designed together with his brother Johann Christoph Effner also the garden in Baroque style in 1717. As a representative of an enlightened absolutism, Elector Max III. Joseph ordered already in 1765 to develop an English landscape garden. Today, the lower part of the garden has been abandoned and is awaiting resurrection.

She was used primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was laid down as HMS Candytuft but was transferred to the RCN on 5 January 1944 before completion. She was named for Long Branch, Ontario, a village that was eventually amalgamated into Toronto, Ontario. Background Flower-class corvettes like Long Branch serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Candytuft was ordered 25 July 1942 as part of the Royal Navy 1942-43 Increased Endurance Flower-class building program. She was laid down 27 February 1943 by A. & J. Inglis Ltd. at Glasgow, Scotland and launched 28 September 1943. As part of an exchange for s that the RCN intended to use as convoy escorts, the Royal Navy transferred four Flower-class corvettes and twelve s to Canada in order to acquire them. Candytuft was transferred on 5 January 1944 and commissioned as HMCS Long Branch into the RCN at Tobermory, Mull. The only significant differences between the RCN and RN 1942-43 Flower classes was a shortened mainmast and varying anti-aircraft armament. Service history Upon commissioning to the RCN she was tasked to join Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-5 at Londonderry Port in April 1944 following a one-month work up period at Tobermory. C-5 sailed with the convoy ONS 233. Long Branch developed mechanical problems during the crossing and underwent a six-week repair at the Newfoundland Drydock upon her arrival at St. John's. She departed St. John's on 14 June to resume duties but returned for further repairs with the assistance of HM Tug Tenacity. Once repaired, she left St. John's a week later to join convoy HXS 300, the largest convoy of the war. She continued as an ocean escort until her final departure from Londonderry on 27 January 1945. She arrived at Halifax under the command of A/Lt.Cdr. J.B. O'Brien, RCNVR on 11 February and commenced a refit. In April she was assigned to Halifax for local duties. Long Branch was paid off from the RCN on 17 June 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was transferred to the War Assets Corporation and sold for commercial use in 1947. She emerged from the conversion as Rexton Kent II, later renamed Rexton Kent. She was scuttled off Cape Spencer, Nova Scotia on 22 February 1966.

The movie is centered on their star player Darnellia Russell and the Roughriders new coach Bill Resler. The film is narrated by Ludacris. Plot The film begins two years before African- American Darnellia Russell attends the predominantly white and upper-class Roosevelt High School. Bill Resler, a tax law professor at the University of Washington, becomes their new girls basketball coach. Resler, a coach who uses animal and nature themes to motivate his team, believes they can win the Washington State championship but they fall short in the first game of the state tournament. A couple of years later, Russell attends Roosevelt High School where she makes the junior-varsity team. Learning of her natural talent, Resler recruits her for the varsity squad. In the following years, the talented Roosevelt team falls short of winning the state championship in close games. Russell receives letters of interest from several major universities. However, after her junior year, she becomes pregnant by her longtime boyfriend and drops out of school. After giving birth to a daughter, Russell returns to Roosevelt for her fifth year. However, the WIAA (Washington Interscholastic Activities Association) bans her from playing basketball due to a rule that states that high school students can only play on their teams for four years, unless a hardship is involved. Russell, believing that having an unplanned child constitutes a hardship, appeals the decision. Attorney Ken Luce, located in Tacoma, Washington, represents her in court and a judge rules in Russell's favor. The WIAA takes the matter to court again, and for the second time the judge grants Russell the right to continue playing. However, the WIAA files a lawsuit against Russell and Roosevelt High School. In defiance of the WIAA, the Roughriders continue to play with Russell on the team. Russell and her team return to the Washington State high school basketball championship tournament and play rivals, the Garfield Bulldogs in the finals. She leads the team to the school's first state championship. Two days later, the WIAA dropped their case. Russell graduates from high school with honors and is named the Northwest Player of the Year. Although Russell didn't receive any college scholarships, she attended North Seattle Community College. After the movie On November 10, 2007, Roosevelt fired Resler as head coach. Roosevelt said that they wanted to go in a \\"different direction.\\"Smith, Craig.\\"Prep Basketball  Resler out at Roosevelt\\" seattletimes.com, November 10, 2007 On July 8, 2008, it was announced that Darnellia Russell had committed to attend Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada for the 2008-09 season.

Kreiner said Russell wanted to return home as she found being separated from her two daughters was much more difficult than she had anticipated. Russell said it was not an easy decision. ‚ÄúI am really sorry for letting everyone down. I knew it was going to be very difficult leaving my kids but this was way more difficult than I can put into words. I want to thank everyone who worked so hard to get me to Thunder Bay; the Lakehead University Athletics Department, coaching staff, players, friends in Seattle, my Seattle coach and all the media who have been so kind to me. This was a tremendous opportunity for me and my decision to leave had nothing to do with the coaching staff or players. I miss my kids and need to be with them.‚Äù Coach Kreiner said he was disappointed but was sympathetic to Russell‚Äôs choice. ‚ÄúDarnellia‚Äôs decision to go back home is an understandable one but also a disappointing one. I had hoped that she would take a little more time to give it more of a chance but we are very happy to have provided her the best opportunity and situation we could for her to achieve her degree while playing at Lakehead University. Darnellia has brought great international media attention to our program and I am honoured that she decided to play for us.‚Äù Lakehead Athletics Director Tom Warden said he understood Russell‚Äôs decision. ‚ÄúI understand about commitment to family and we‚Äôre very sorry it didn‚Äôt work out for her here at Lakehead. We wish her the best of luck in the future.‚Äù Mackenzie Argens, one of the freshmen Resler inserted during the state championship game, received a basketball scholarship to the University of Washington.

It included much of what is southeastern Oklahoma and the northeastern counties in Texas (Bowie, Red River, Lamar, Fannin, Cass, Morris, Titus, Franklin, Hopkins, Delta and Hunt). It was named for James Miller, the first governor of the Arkansas Territory. Formation of original county According to historian Rex W. Strickland, there were three different political entities that have borne the name \\"Miller County, Arkansas\\". All have been in the southwestern corner of the state of Arkansas, but covered different areas at different times. The first was created in 1820, before Arkansas became a state. The second existed after Arkansas was required to cede the land that was inside the boundary of Indian Territory. The third was created after Arkansas was required to relinquish its claim to land that was to become part of the Republic of Texas.\\"Miller County, Arkansas Territory, The Frontier That Men Forgot\\" Strickland, Rex W. , Chronicles of Oklahoma 18:1 (March 1940) 12-34 Accessed August 16, 2006 and June 3, 2016 Effective April 1, 1820, Miller County was established by the Arkansas Territorial Assembly through a partitioning of Hempstead County. The Act, signed by Territorial Governor James Miller, delineated its borders as follows: > Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Territory of Arkansas, That all > that portion of the County of Hempstead and bounded as follows, to-wit: > Beginning on the north bank of the great Red River, at a point due south of > the Cossetat Bayou, a branch of Little River, thence due north to the mouth > of the Cossetat Bayou aforesaid, then up said bayou to the head of its main > branch, then north to the boundary line of Clark, then due west with said > line to the Canadian river, or the Indian boundary line, then with the said > line to the great Red river aforesaid, then southeasterly with the Indian or > Spanish boundary line to a point due south of the point of beginning, then > due north to the beginning, to be laid off and erected into a separate > county, to be called and known by the name of the county of > Miller.Strickland, Rex W. \\"Establishment of 'Old' Miller County, Arkansas > Territory - Chapter 2,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.

In modern terms, Old Miller County included parts of three states: Arkansas ( Little River, Sevier and Polk counties), Oklahoma (LeFlore and Latimer counties, Choctaw, McCurtain and Pushmataha counties) and Texas. The 1820 territorial census listed 999 residents in Miller County, 82 of them slaves. Initially, the county seat was the Gilliland Settlement.Conner, Seymour V. \\"Miller County, Arkansas,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, June 15, 2010. Accessed June 03, 2016. In August 1821, the county commissioners selected Miller Court House as the county seat.Oklahoma, A History of Five Centuries, 2nd Edition by Arrel Morgan Gibson, OU Press, 1981, page 40.

Removal of area promised to Choctaws Although settlers continued to move into the area, the Treaty of Doak's Stand (October 18, 1820) was about to change Miller County. After Doak's Stand, Choctaws had already been moving into the area of Arkansas Territory, but a treaty signed January 20, 1825, ceded the land west of a line \\"one hundred paces east of Fort Smith, and running thence, due south, to Red river\\" to them in exchange for their land in the East. The residents of Miller County signed petitions, the territorial government pressured Washington, but all to no avail. Finally, on October 17, 1828, the territorial legislature abolished Miller County north of the Red River and added the remnant of that county east of the new boundary line to Sevier County. The residents who remained in the county burned Miller Court House and all the county records on November 5, 1828.Strickland, Rex W . \\"Miller County, Arkansas Territory: The Frontier That Men Forgot-Chapter III\\" , Chronicles of Oklahoma 19:1 (March 1941)] Accessed August 16, 2006 (NOTE: Map included) Removal of areas claimed by Texas The commissioners moved the county seat to Jonesborough plantation south of the Red River on October 23, 1832, and the Miller Court House post office relocated there. However, Miller County south of the Red River was in dispute with the Mexican government. After Texas seceded, they attempted to enforce their claims to the area. In 1838, Texas formed Fannin County, and Washington finally discontinued the Miller Court House post office on December 28, 1838. When Texas joined the Union in 1845 the borders became permanent.

Pate near Baldwin City, Kansas. The battle is cited as one incident of \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" and a contributing factor leading up to the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865. Background In 1854, the U.S. Congress had passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act which stipulated that the residents of these territories would decide whether they wished to enter the Union as a slave or free state. This doctrine became known as popular sovereignty. Organized groups from the North sent thousands of abolitionist supporters to Kansas in an attempt to tip the balance in favor of free state advocates, to counter settlement from proslavery supporters from Missouri. As a result, pro- and antislavery groups had frequent clashes culminating in the Battle of Black Jack. On May 21, 1856, Henry C. Pate participated with a posse of 750 proslavery forces in the sacking of Lawrence, which destroyed the Free State Hotel, two abolitionist newspaper offices and their printing presses. They also looted throughout the village. The next day, Congressman Preston Brooks from South Carolina physically attacked Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in the Senate chambers with a cane. He continued hitting after the senator was bleeding and unconscious. Three days later, a band of men, led by John Brown and comrade Captain Shore, executed five proslavery men with broadswords at Pottawatomie Creek. Brown's men let Jerome Glanville and James Harris return home to the cabin of Harris. This incident became known as the Pottawatomie massacre. Following the massacre, three antislavery men were taken prisoner, including two of John Brown's sons. Battle On June 2, 1856 Brown and 29 others met Henry Pate and fought the battle of Black Jack. This started after Brown's two sons were captured and held prisoner by Pate. The five-hour battle went in Brown's favor and Pate and 22 of his followers were captured and held for ransom. Brown agreed to release them as long as they released Brown's sons. Town of Black Jack The town of Black Jack was established in 1855 as a trail town on the Santa Fe Trail. The town became incorporated in 1857 and the threat of border warfare was still a problem in Black Jack. At its peak, Black Jack contained a tavern, post office, blacksmiths, a hotel, general store, doctor's office, schools and two churches but by the end of the Civil War, Santa Fe traffic began to dwindle and soon the town was abandoned. Legacy The site of the battle is located near U.S. Highway 56, about three miles (5 km) east of Baldwin City, and is partially within Robert Hall Pearson Memorial Park, designated by the state of Kansas in honor of one of Brown and Shore's fighters who gave a handwritten account of the battle. Signs placed throughout the battle site point out where the battle began and ended. Efforts are underway to preserve both the Pearson Memorial Park and the Ivan Boyd Prairie Preserve across the road. In 1970, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of Baldwin City, Baker University professor and playwright Don Mueller (not to be confused with the baseball player of the same name) and Phyllis E. Braun, Business Manager, produced a musical play entitled The Ballad Of Black Jack to tell the story of the events that led up to the battle. The Ballad Of Black Jack played as part of the city's Maple Leaf Festival from 1970‚Äì83 and again from 2001-05. It also played in nearby Lawrence in 1986 and in 2006 and 2007 as a part of Lawrence's Civil War On The Western Frontier program.

MoCCA sponsored events ranging from book openings to educational programs in New York City schools, and hosted classes, workshops and lectures. MoCCA was perhaps best known for its annual small-press comic convention, known as MoCCA Fest, first held in 2002.  History  MoCCA was founded by Lawrence Klein in October 2001. It was located at 594 Broadway in New York City. On July 9, 2012, MoCCA announced that it would be closing its physical location, effective immediately, due to fundraising difficulties. On August 2, 2012, MoCCA announced plans to transfer their assets to the Society of Illustrators, providing MoCCA with a street- level location in the Society's Upper East Side building. It was confirmed that MoCCA Fest would continue to exist. MoCCA Festival The MoCCA Festival (or MoCCA Fest) is an annual fundraiser for the museum (and now for the Society of Illustrators). It is New York's largest independent comics showcase, featuring hundreds of creators and publishers on the main floor, typically accompanied with additional rooms devoted to educational panel discussions, slide shows, and interviews. From its inception in 2002 until 2008 it was held at the Puck Building. From 2009 to 2014, it took place at the 69th Regiment Armory. In 2015, the event was split between two locations, with the exhibitors in Center548, and the programming at the High Line Hotel.Spurgeon, Tom. \\"MoCCA Announces Move Into Center548; Initial Guests,\\" The Comics Reporter (September 24, 2014).\\"MoCCA Arts Festival partners with the historic High Line Hotel to host weekend programming!,\\" MoCCA Fest official Tumblr site (Jan. 22, 2015). Plans to convert Center548 to a residential property forced the Society to find new venue. From 2016 through at least 2019, Metropolitan West has hosted the exhibitors with programming taking take place at Ink48. From 2002 to 2012, the museum presented an award at MoCCA Fest to an artist whose outstanding work elevated the comic art form. Originally known as the MoCCA Art Festival Award, it was renamed the Klein Award in 2009 in honor of MoCCA Founder Lawrence Klein. MoCCA Fest hosted the comics industry's 2004 and 2005 Harvey Awards.HarveyAwards.org: \\"Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art Announces 2004 Harveys Nominees\\" Press release (May 13, 2005): \\"18th Annual Harvey Awards Winners to Be Announced in June 11 Ceremony in NYC\\" Exhibits The MoCCA table at the Big Apple Con, November 14, 2008 In 2003, MoCCA opened its art gallery with the debut exhibit \\"Gag Art!\\", focusing on single-panel magazine cartoons. Subsequent exhibits included the relationship between New York City and cartoonists, an exhibition of women comic-book artists, retrospectives devoted to Stan Lee and Will Eisner, and \\"From Richie Rich to Wendy the Good Little Witch: The Art of Harvey Comics\\". Their The Art of Archie Comics exhibit was promoted with a story in Archie Digest Magazine #260, March 2010. The seven-page story, MoCCA Madness, was written by Arie Kaplan and drawn by Fernando Ruiz. It featured appearances by MoCCA President Ellen Abramowitz and then-Director Karl Erickson, and was subsequently reprinted in Archie: A Celebration of America's Favorite Teenagers by Craig Yoe (IDW, 2011).

The software is designed to work with AirPort Time Capsule, the Wi-Fi router with built-in hard disk, as well as other internal and external disk drives. It was introduced in Mac OS X Leopard. Overview Time Machine creates incremental backups of files that can be restored at a later date. It allows the user to restore the whole system or specific files from the Recovery HD or the macOS Install DVD. It works within Mail, iWork, iLife, and several other compatible programs, making it possible to restore individual objects (e.g. emails, photos, contacts, calendar events) without leaving the application. According to an Apple support statement: > ‚ÄúTime Machine is a backup utility, not an archival utility, it is not > intended as offline storage. Time Machine captures the most recent state of > your data on your disk. As snapshots age, they are prioritized progressively > lower compared to your more recent ones.‚Äù For backups to a network drive, Time Machine allows the user to back up Mac computers over the network, and supports backing up to certain network attached storage devices or servers, depending on the version of Time Machine. Earlier versions worked with a wide variety of NAS servers, but later versions require the server to support a recent version of Apple‚Äôs Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), and Time Machine no longer works with servers using earlier versions of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol typical for Windows servers. Some of the legacy support can be re-enabled by using hand-tuned configuration options, accessed through the Terminal. Apple's Time Capsule acts as a network storage device specifically for Time Machine backups, allowing both wired and wireless backups to the Time Capsule's internal hard drive. Time Machine may also be used with any external or internal volume. Time Machine saves hourly backups for the past 24 hours, daily backups for the past month, and weekly backups for everything older than a month until the volume runs out of space. At that point, Time Machine deletes the oldest weekly backup. User interface Time Machine's user interface when retrieving a file uses Apple's Core Animation API. Upon its launch, Time Machine \\"floats\\" the active Finder or application window from the user's desktop to a backdrop depicting the user's blurred desktop wallpaper. Behind the current active window are stacked windows, with each window representing a snapshot of how that folder or application looked on the given date and time in the past. When toggling through the previous snapshots, the stacked windows extend backwards, giving the impression of flying through a \\"time tunnel.\\" While paging through these \\"windows from the past,\\" a previous version of the data (or presently deleted data) may be retrieved. Storage Time Machine works with locally connected storage disks, which must be formatted in the HFS+ volume format‚ÄîAPFS-formatted won't work, as well as with remote storage media shared from other systems, including Time Capsule, via the network. When using remote storage, Time Machine uses sparse bundles. This acts as an isolation layer, which makes the storage neutral to the actual file system used by the network server, and also permits the replication of the backup from one storage medium to another. Sparse bundles are mounted by macOS like any other device, presenting their content as a HFS+ formatted volume, functionally similar to a local storage. Requirements Time Machine places strict requirements on the backup storage medium. The only officially supported configurations are: * A hard drive or partition connected directly to the computer, either internally or by a bus like USB or FireWire, and formatted as journaled HFS+. * A folder on a journaled HFS+ file system shared by another Mac on the same network running at least Leopard. * A drive shared by an Apple Time Capsule on the same network. * A drive connected to an Apple AirPort Extreme 802.11ac model on the same network. (Earlier generations of the AirPort Extreme are not supported.) * Local network volumes connected using the Apple Filing Protocol or via an SMB3 share that advertises a number of capabilities. On a Time Capsule, the backup data is stored in an HFS+ disk image and accessed via Apple Filing Protocol. Although it is not officially supported, users and manufacturers have configured FreeBSD and Linux servers and network-attached storage systems to serve Time Machine-enabled Macs. Also see slowfranklin's comment and its replies. To add the guest UAM, add \`AFPD_UAMLIST=\\"-U uams_guest.so\\"\` to the \`[Global]\` section in \`afp.conf\`. Operation Time Machine creates a folder on the designated Time Machine volume (local or inside a remote sparse image) into which it copies the directory tree of all locally attached disk drives, except for files and directories that the user has specified to omit, including the Time Machine volume itself. Every hour thereafter, it creates a new subordinate folder and copies only files that have changed since the last backup and creates hard links to files that already exist on the backup drive. A user can browse the directory hierarchy of these copies as if browsing the primary disk. Some other backup utilities save deltas for file changes, much like version control systems. Such an approach permits more frequent backups of minor changes, but can often complicate the interaction with the backup volume. By contrast, it is possible to manually browse a Time Machine backup volume without using the Time Machine interface; the use of hard links presents each backup to the user as a complete disk copy. Time Machine creates multiple hard links to unmodified directories. Multiple linking of directories is a peculiar feature for HFS+, and is not supported on modern Unix file systems including Apple's own APFS. As a result, tools like rsync cannot be used to replicate a Time Machine volume; replication can only reliably be done by imaging the entire filesystem. Apple system events record when each directory is modified on the hard drive. This means that instead of examining every file's modification date when it is activated, Time Machine only needs to scan the directories that changed for files to copy (the remainder being hard-linked). This differs from the approach taken by similar backup utilities rsync and FlyBack, which examine modification dates of all files during backup. Time Machine is also available in the Leopard, Snow Leopard, and Lion installation process. One of the features in the Migration Assistant interface is to re-install the contents of a Time Machine backup. In other words, a hard drive can be restored from a Time Machine backup in the event of a catastrophic crash. OS X Mountain Lion introduced the ability to use multiple volumes simultaneously for Time Machine operations. When the user specifies more than one volume to use, macOS rotates among the desired volumes each time it does a backup. Coding differences between OS X Mountain Lion and Mavericks have resulted in compatibility issues related to Time Machine's system restoration functionality. Time Machine backups created by Apple computers purchased as recently as late 2012 cannot be used for system restoration on 2013 or 2014 models.. However, the data from the backup can still be recovered by directly accessing the files from the Time Machine Volume.  Exclusion  Time Machine supports two forms of exclusion: one based on a user-configured list of paths (plus a set of system defaults), the other based on the extended file attribute . Since the attribute is applied to the file or directory directly, moving or copying will not affect the exclusion. The attribute should contain the string in any property list format. Writing instead sets the exclusion for iOS backups. Google Chrome is known to use the attribute to exclude its histories. Third-party backup applications that respect this setting include CrashPlan and Arq. Apple wraps the attribute into the command-line utility as well as a CoreServices API.

It is bounded by the James Bay, Downtown, Harris Green, Fernwood, Rockland, and Gonzales (Foul Bay) neighbourhoods, and meets the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the south (.pdf map). Community Fairfield is the southernmost neighbourhood in the city of Victoria, on southern Vancouver Island. It is Victoria's largest community by population and area, when considered together with the adjacent Gonzales neighbourhood. Fairfield is a residential community with a mix of low-rise apartments and single family homes on well-maintained, tree-lined streets, such as Wellington Avenue. It is bounded to the east by Oak Bay, to the north by the community of Rockland, to the west by Beacon Hill Park and to the south by the ocean shoreline of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Fairfield features the historic Ross Bay Cemetery, as well as many heritage buildings dating from the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. The Fairfield Gonzalez Community Association (FGCA) serves \\"to enhance the quality of life in Fairfield by involving community members in identifying and acting on the needs of area residents\\". The FGCA operates from and maintains the Fairfield Community Place, Fairfield's only neighbourhood centre. Its various committees help organize special events, recycling programs, beach cleanups, emergency preparedness programs, review and publicize planning and zoning changes, increase public awareness of community impacts from development, etc. Significant population growth and demographic shifts are expected for southern Vancouver Island. The City of Victoria has prepared a neighbourhood profile from 2001 data: History Having founded the Hudson's Bay Company's (HBC) Fort Victoria in the 1850s, Sir James Douglas acquired for himself a large property between Fort Street and Clover Point, which he called Fairfield Farm. To the east lay the lands of Joseph Despard Pemberton (which stretched into what would become Oak Bay) and Isabelle Ross, BC's first female land owner (the location of Ross Bay Cemetery, land mistakenly thought to have been owned by her husband and HBC chief factor Charles Ross). \\"Fairfield\\", at 601 Trutch Street, was built in 1861 by Joseph Trutch, who would later become the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia. Although some houses in the western areas of Fairfield date from the 1880s, it was shortly after the turn of the century that much of the neighbourhood was developed, in a residential housing boom that ended in 1913. It was in the early part of the twentieth century that the original Sir James Douglas Elementary School and the present Margaret Jenkins Elementary School were built to serve the community. One of the oldest structures in central Fairfield is located at 1263 Richardson Street, a gothic gabled building from the 1860s (now strata-titled) that was moved down the hill from Rockland Avenue in the Rockland neighbourhood to make way for a much grander residence that today stands beside the Langham Court theatre. Landmarks and Parkland The beach at Beacon Hill The view from Clover Point City Parks in the Fairfield neighbourhood include: *Beacon Hill *Clover Point *Ross Bay Cemetery *Moss Rock (Fairfield Hill) Park *Robert Porter Park *Brooke Street Park *Eberts Street Park *Pioneer Square as well as several other smaller parks, playgrounds and greenspaces. The popular scenic destination Clover Point offers views south to Washington State's Olympic Mountains, east to the impressive snow clad Mount Baker‚Äîa dormant volcano‚Äîand west to the Sooke Hills of southwestern Vancouver Island. The ocean waters off of the Point and along the Dallas Road waterfront are very popular with wind surfing and para-sailing enthusiasts thanks to strong on-shore winds. Clover Point is also the site of one of Victoria's two sewage pumping station's and a possible location for a sewage treatment plant mandated for the city by the BC government in July 2006. Landmarks and areas of special interest include: *YM- YWCA of Greater Victoria *Christ Church Cathedral and School *Mount St. Mary Hospital *Beacon Hill Montessori Pre-School *Fairfield United Church *Sir James Douglas Elementary School *Ross Bay Villa (a.k.a. The Winter House) Fairfield is the site of popular commercial hubs, Cook Street Village, Five Corners and the Fairfield Plaza. Cook Street Village, a commercial area characterized by sidewalk-flanking Horse Chestnut trees, low-height buildings and the absence of bisecting roads, is a popular shopping and social strip in Fairfield, with caf√©s, restaurants, small boutiques and grocery stores. Shops and services in the village include the locally renowned Pic-a-Flic video store, Moka House, Bubby's Kitchen and the Beagle Pub. In 2006, proposed developments within this part of Fairfield sparked concern and debate among local residents . Another small neighbourhood centre, known as Five Corners, is located at the intersection of Moss Street and Fairfield Road, featuring Sir James Douglas Elementary School, Fairfield United Church, Fairfield Bicycles, a general store, fish and chips shop, veterinary clinic and other services. This location has historically been a hub of community activity since the community's earliest days. The school yard of Sir James Douglas school is the site of the locally-famous Moss Street Market , which runs weekly from April until October. The Fairfield Plaza, a compact strip mall, is another modest shopping area, situated near the Fairfield/Gonzales border. It is worth noting however, as having the first Thrifty Foods of the Thrifty Foods grocery store chain , as well as the Ross Bay Pub, the Ross Bay Health Centre, government liquor store, Home Hardware and other enterprises. Across Fairfield Road from the western entrance to the Fairfield Plaza is Emily Carr‚Äôs grave, in the Ross Bay Cemetery.

Stanis≈Çawa, Russian: –û—Ä–¥–µ–Ω—ä –°–≤. –°—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤–∞), also spelled Stanislas, is a Russian dynastic order of knighthood founded as Order of the Knights of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr in 1765 by King Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1831 after the downfall of the November Uprising, the order was incorporated into the Chapter of Russian Orders as part of the honours system of the Russian Empire by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. In 1839, the Russian Order of Saint Stanislaus received new statutes, including granting status of nobility on its recipients in all three classes. As a result of the Russian Revolution 1917, activities were suspended by the Soviet Union, although it has since been awarded by the head of the Imperial House of Romanov as a dynastic order. When in 1918 Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic, a Polish order was introduced as a successor to the Polish Order of Saint Stanislaus, the Order of Polonia Restituta. However, the Order of Saint Stanislas continued to be awarded after the revolution by Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich, and Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna; the latter a claimant to the headship of the Imperial House. History=Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski, King of Poland established the Order of the Knights of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr on May 7, 1765 to honour the service to the King. After the partition of Poland it was renewed in the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807. Since 1815 in the Polish (Congress) Kingdom, the order, originally in a single class, was retained and divided into four classes. When in 1918 Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic, a Polish order was introduced as an alleged successor to the Polish Order of Saint Stanislaus, the Order of Polonia Restituta. Russian Empire Emperor Nicholas I of Russia made Order of Saint Stanislaus a Russian order and introduced new statutes 1839. In 1831 after the downfall of the November Uprising, the order was added to the honours system of the Russian Empire in 1832, where it remained until 1917, included in the Chapter of Russian Orders. In 1832 the image of Saint Stanislaus was removed, replacing it with the cypher \\"SS\\". The single-headed eagle on the Polish order's cross was replaced with the double-headed eagle of the Russian Empire. All administration and management of the imperial and royal order were transferred from Warsaw to St. Petersburg. In 1839 Nicholas I issued a new statute for the order, according to which it was divided into three degrees, and was awarded to \\"any subject of the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Poland\\" for military and civilian distinction, or for private services such as charity and philanthropy. The Second Class insignia of the Order was divided into two types: a cross decorated with the imperial crown, and the cross without the crown (this distinction was abolished in 1874). In 1844, it was decreed that when the order was granted to non-Christians, the cypher of St. Stanislaus was replaced by a black double-headed Imperial Russian eagle. The Order of Sant Stanislaus 3rd degree became the junior most award in the order of precedence of Russian orders and was the most common reward. It was awarded to almost all military and government employees as well as civilians who served the empire with a blameless record, and who has status in the Russian table of ranks. At the time of the establishment of the Order, the award of every class provided the right of hereditary noble status, but there was discontent among the nobility that too many new nobles were being created from the ranks of merchants and civil employees, and so in 1845 the highest command suspended the awarding of the 2nd and 3rd class. Awarding resumed on 28 June 1855, but from this date the right of hereditary nobility was awarded only with the 1st class of the Order of Saint Stanislaus. In 1855 the symbol of crossed swords was added to Military awards of the order. In 1874 the Chapter of Orders canceled the awarding of the symbol of the imperial crown, but any such orders previously awarded retained the right to wear them with the crown. Provisional Government After the February Revolution, the order was not canceled. The Provisional Government of Russia arguably usurped the Order of Saint Stanislaus, changing its appearance: the imperial eagles were changed to crown less republican eagles. However, after 1917, the order was not awarded in Soviet Russia in any form. Legitimist conferral in exile Both Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia and his successor Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia awarded the Order of Saint Andrew, which automatically awards the recipient membership First class in all the lower Orders, including the Order of Saint Stanislaus. Furthermore, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia awarded the order independently at least once, in 1973. As a result, the Order of Saint Stanislaus is considered to have been awarded continually by the legitimist pretender to the Russian throne since 1917. Present fount of honour is Maria Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of Russia, preeminent pretender to the Russian throne. Initially active in exile after the revolution, in recent years it has enjoyed degrees of recognition by some prominent Russian institutions, as well as full recognition by the International Commission on Orders of Chivalry and others.  Organisation  The heads of the Russian Imperial House in exile have continued to award Imperial and Royal Order of Saint Stanislaus. H.I.H. Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna, pretender to the Russian throne, and head of the Russian Imperial House, continues to award the Russian Imperial Order of Saint Stanislaus as a dynastic order of knighthood. These actions were disputed by her relative Dmitry Romanov. Knights of the Order of Saint Stanislaus are granted nobility in every class if they do not already possess this status: hereditary nobility in the First class, personal nobility in the Second and Third classes. Knights of the Order of Saint Stanislaus were once also awarded a pension: the 30 senior knights of the First class received 143 rubles, the 60 senior gentlemen of the Second class received 115 rubles, and the 90 senior gentlemen of the Third class received 86 rubles. These pensions were abolished by Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna in 2014.

According to the Imperial Chapter of Orders and other honors, ed. 1892 [2], the Order of Saint Stanislaus has three degrees, for which the insignia are: = 1st class = Gold cross, covered with a red enamel face, the four ends of which are further divided in two sharp points; on the edges of the cross a double gold rim; at the eight sharp points golden balls; and among these terminals, bringing them together, are gold semicircles of striped shells; in the center, on a white filigree round shield encircled by a gold border with a green wreath on it, the Latin monogram of Saint Stanislaus, a red \\"SS\\"; at each of the axillae, the state symbol of the Russian double-headed eagle in gold. On the rear side of the cross, all gold, with the verso a centered white round enameled shield, which depicts the same monogram \\"SS\\". It is worn on a moir√© red ribbon, the breadth of two and a half inches, double white stripes at the borders, worn over the right shoulder with the star on the left side of the chest. Silver star, the eight rays centering a white round shield circled with wide green stripes with two gold rims, the external rim wider; on the green enameled band between, gold laurel branches connected in the middle of each by two flowers; center roundel, in white enamel with red letters the cypher of Saint Stanislaus: \\"SS\\"; and around the hoop in a white box with gold letters, the motto of the order: Praemiando incitat (\\"rewarding encourages\\") divided at the top with a golden flower. = 2nd class = Cross of the same form, as for the first class, but of lesser magnitude, worn around the neck, on a ribbon with a width of one or two inches. = 3rd class = Cross of the same form as the first two classes but worn in the buttonhole on the same ribbon with a width of five-eighths inches. Legacy=Self-styled orders A number of self-styled orders, or pseudo-orders, exist, claiming to be continuations of the original imperial order. While several of these may be praise-worthy philanthropic organisations, one even boasting \\"royal patronage\\" by morganatic descendants of the Russian Imperial House, none of them are recognised as legitimate orders of chivalry. Only the Russian Imperial Order of Saint Stanislas, awarded by Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna (b.1953) is recognised as a post-1917 legitimate order and the direct continuation of the pre- revolutionary order, recognised by the International Commission on Orders of Chivalry, the Augustan Society, and Burke's Peerage, among other official third-party bodies.

Many worker centers in the United States focus on immigrant and low-wage workers in sectors such as restaurant, construction, day labor and agriculture. Purpose Worker centers are non-profit institutions based in the community and led by their worker-members, which deliver support to low earning workers. In order to best assist in improving working conditions and necessary wages, many centers include services such as English language instruction, help with unpaid wage claims, access to health care, leadership development, educational activities, advocacy and organization. Many centers also take the role as defender of rights for immigrants in their communities.http://www.epi.org/publication/bp159/ Effect Day Laborer Worker Centers Worker centers support employment of day laborers in three primary ways. First, they provide a minimum wage rate. Second, they supply a distribution process for job opportunities, and third, they maintain wage standards through their support to workers victimized through wage withholding from employers.http://www.csup.ucla.edu/publications/Worker%20Center%20and%20Labor%20Market%20Outcomes.pdf/view Other Worker Centers Worker centers that are not specific to a type of worker such as a day laborer can perform support their worker members in a wide variety of ways. Many centers offer workers rights & immigrant rights trainings. They will also address specific workplace grievances of their worker members and use the legal system, community pressure and workplace organizing to change conditions Naduris-Weissman, E. (March 2009). The Worker Center Movement and Traditional Labor Law: A Contextual Analysis. Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law. Vol 30 Issue 1 http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1413&context;=bjell Origins of Worker Centers According to Janice Fine‚Äôs study, worker centers developed in three stages. The first worker centers emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, founded by black worker activists in North Carolina and South Carolina, immigrant activists in New York City‚Äôs Chinatown, the Texas-Mexican Border in El Paso, in San Francisco among Chinese immigrants.Fine, Janice. Worker Centers: Organizing Communities at the Edge of the Dream. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2006. Page 9 They grew out of a response to neoliberal policies that resulted in declining working conditions in manufacturing, factory closings and an increase in low wage service sector jobs. Worker centers were also created in reaction to ‚Äúdisparities of pay and treatment between African American and white workers as well as exploitation within ethnic economic enclaves and in the broader economic (including informal sector) were also major catalysts‚Äù.Fine, Janice. Worker Centers: Organizing Communities at the Edge of the Dream. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2006. Page 9 From the late 1980s to early 1990s, the second wave of worker centers appeared as large groups of new Latino immigrants, some fleeing civil wars in Central America, arrived in suburban and urban regions, as well as Southeast Asians immigrants, all searching for economic opportunities. These worker centers were established by numerous individuals and institutions such as ‚Äúchurches and other faith-based organizations, social service and legal aid agencies, immigrant nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and unions‚Äù.Fine, Janice. Worker Centers: Organizing Communities at the Edge of the Dream. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2006. Page 11 The last wave of worker centers began in 2000 to the present. Many worker centers are expanding not only in the city, but into the suburbs, rural regions, and southern states where there is a large concentration of Mexican and Central immigrants working in the poultry, service, agriculture, and meat- packing sectors. Not only that, more worker centers are emerging among Korean, Filipino, South Asian and African immigrants, and they have a higher connection to faith-based organizations and unions.Fine, Janice. Worker Centers: Organizing Communities at the Edge of the Dream. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2006. Page 11 Features of Worker Centers What is unique about worker centers, and makes them unlike unions, is that they operate outside of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and therefore do not have to have a specific organizational model, strategy or structure. They emerge as ‚Äúcommunity-based mediating institutions that provide support to and organize among communities of low wage workers‚Äù.Fine, Janice. Worker Centers: Organizing Communities at the Edge of the Dream. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2006. Page 11 As such, they use diverse strategies, tactics and approaches to serve the needs of their individual communities. Worker‚Äôs centers are not considered labor organizations, and therefore are not restricted by the same laws under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and Labor Management and Reporting Disclosure acts that govern traditional unions. The NLRA restricts primary picketing activity, bans any type of secondary activity, including pickets or boycotts, of business connected to the primary target Crain & Matheny (2001). Labor‚Äôs Identity Crisis. California Law Review, Vol 89, No. 6, pp. 1767-1846. http://www.jstor.org/stable/3481249. Worker centers, on the other hand, are allowed to picket businesses, can participate in secondary boycotts and interact with press in a way that makes them uniquely threatening to business interests. Common features of worker centers include: a hybrid organization, providing necessary services, and engaging in advocacy; possess a broad agenda, approach the world with a global perspective, democracy-building, they build coalitions and have small and involved memberships.Fine, Janice. Worker Centers: Organizing Communities at the Edge of the Dream. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2006. Pages 12-14 Though the vision of most worker centers is change on a systemic scale, they do meet and bargain with individual employers to improve conditions for workers Miller, J. (2015). Workers Centers: Organizing the unorganizable. The American Prospect. http://prospect.org/article/workers-centers-organizing- unorganizable . These meetings will often happen even if only a few workers in a workplace are involved. Under Section 7 of the NLRA, employees have \\"the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection‚Äù. Mutual aid or protection has been broadly interpreted to include any action (excluding criminal actions) that workers take in response to any of change in the workplace that has to do with the conditions of employment, not simply those covered by employment law Hyde, A. (1993). Employee Caucus: A Key Institution in the Emerging System of Employment Law. Chicago-Kent Law Review. Vol 69, Issue 1, Article 7 http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2842&context;=cklawreview .This means that even a few worker members of a worker center have the right to challenge their employers regarding working conditions and not be terminated as a result. This coverage allows great flexibility for worker centers to address everything from stolen wages and hourly pay to conditions such as high temperatures in warehouses or widespread sexual harassment in a workplace. Despite diverse strategies, most centers do similar types of work. This includes helping workers combat wage theft through filings claims, collaborating with governmental agencies to assure enforcement of labor laws and wage theft claims, launching ‚Äúdirect action campaigns against specific employers and sometimes across particular industries, and engaging in leadership development and popular education‚Äù.Fine, Janice. Worker Centers: Organizing Communities at the Edge of the Dream. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2006. Page 12 Since they define themselves as dedicated to systemic change, many worker centers also play a role as policy partners in passing laws such as a higher minimum wage, mandatory paid sick days, and domestic workers bill of rights. Their worker base mobilizes not just in actions against individual employers but in broader social movements such as immigrant rights actions Fine, J. (2006). Worker Centers: Organizing Communities at the Edge of the Dream. Cornell University Press. http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context;=books Some centers are founded by previous union organizers, or have affiliations with unions, however, as previously stated, they are not unions. Worker centers exist to meet the demand for services that unions could or would not give. Many worker centers are established for immigrant and minority groups that work jobs where they are left out of the formal labor market and do not have the right to NLRA protection, such as day laborers, domestic workers and agricultural workers Livengood, R. (2013). Organizing for Structural Change: The Potential and Promise of Workers Center. Harvard Civil Rights Civil Liberties Law Review. Vol 48 http://harvardcrcl.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/04/Livengood_325-356.pdf . Others have organized around groups, such as restaurant workers (Fight for 15, ROC United), that traditional unions have ignored as being too difficult to organize. In order to establish a union in a workplace, the union must get union cards from at least half the workers or have a majority vote for the union in an election Pope, J. G. (2006) Next-Wave Organizing and the Transition to a New Paradigm of Labor Law. Research Paper No. 013. http://ssrn.com/abstract=942771. This is a great challenge in workplaces such as fast food jobs that suffer from high turnover, or in industries such as contracted cleaning companies, where even figuring out the number of employees and where they are located can be extremely difficult Networks Nationally, there exist at least three networks that link worker centers together: :1. The National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) that works with approximately 30 day labor centers. :2. Interfaith Worker Justice (IWJ), which connects 34 worker centers that have strong ties to religious communities. :3. The Food Chain Workers Alliance has 17 members, 12 of which are workers centers that work with workers in the entire food system. The workers are included in the following core food industries: production, processing, distribution, retail, and service.http://foodchainworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Hands-That- Feed-Us-Report.pdf In August 2006, NDLON announced a new partnership with the AFL-CIO: \\"The AFL-CIO and NDLON will work together for state and local enforcement of rights as well as the development of new protections in areas including wage and hour laws, health and safety regulations, immigrants‚Äô rights and employee misclassification. They will also work together for comprehensive immigration reform that supports workplace rights and includes a path to citizenship and political equality for immigrant workers ‚Äì and against punitive, anti-immigrant, anti-worker legislation.\\"\\"AFL-CIO & NDLON Enter Watershed Agreement to Improve Conditions for Working Families,\\" press release, National Day Laborer Organizing Network, August 9, 2006.

Solid gallium trichloride exists as a dimer with the formula Ga2Cl6.Wells, A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press. . It is colourless and soluble in virtually all solvents, even alkanes, which is truly unusual for a metal halide. It is the main precursor to most derivatives of gallium and a reagent in organic synthesis. As a Lewis acid, GaCl3 is milder than aluminium trichloride. Gallium(III) is easier to reduce than Al(III), so the chemistry of reduced gallium compounds is more extensive than for aluminium. Ga2Cl4 is known whereas the corresponding Al2Cl4 is not. The coordination chemistry of Ga(III) and Fe(III) are similar, and gallium(III) compounds have been used as diamagnetic analogues of ferric compounds.

Structure As a solid, it adopts a bitetrahedral structure with two bridging chlorides. Its structure resembles that of aluminium tribromide. In contrast AlCl3 and InCl3 feature contain 6 coordinate metal centers. As a consequence of its molecular nature and associated low lattice energy, gallium trichloride has a lower melting point vs the aluminium and indium trihalides. The formula of Ga2Cl6 is often written as Ga2(Œº-Cl)2Cl4. In the gas phase the dimers dissociate to trigonal planar monomers. Complexes Gallium is the lightest member of Group 13 to have a full d shell, (gallium has the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d10 4s2 4p1) below the valence electrons that could take part in d-œÄ bonding with ligands. The low oxidation state of Ga in Ga(III)Cl3, along with the low electronegativity and high polarisability, allow GaCl3 to behave as a \\"soft acid\\" in terms of the HSAB theory. The strength of the bonds between gallium halides and ligands have been extensively studied. What emerges is: *GaCl3 is a weaker Lewis acid than AlCl3 towards N and O donors e.g. pyridine *GaCl3 is a stronger Lewis acid than AlCl3 towards thioethers e.g. dimethyl sulfide, Me2S With a chloride ion as ligand the tetrahedral GaCl4‚àí ion is produced, the 6 coordinate GaCl63‚àí cannot be made.

Detection of solar neutrinos  110 tons of gallium trichloride aqueous solution was used in the GALLEX and GNO experiments performed at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy to detect solar neutrinos.

Background The Science and Art Department was created as a subdivision of the Board of Trade in 1853, expanding the existing Department of Practical Art. Its first Superintendent was Henry Cole, and it supported not just science but also \\"practical arts\\" - i.e. technology and design. The Department benefited substantially from the Great Exhibition of 1851, part of the profits of which were distributed by the Commissioners of the Great Exhibition for educational purposes. That donation funded a large site in South Kensington accommodating the Science and Art Department, the South Kensington Museum, and other bodies. In 1856 the Science and Art Department was absorbed by a new Education Department, but retained considerable autonomy in promoting artistic and scientific higher education, especially for teacher training. The Science and Art Department took over the Government School of Design, founded in 1837, which became the National Art Training School in 1853, and finally in 1896 The Royal College of Art, under which name it still flourishes. It developed what became known as the South Kensington system in art education. The Headmaster until 1875 was Richard Burchett. On the science side it ran classes in South Kensington in the 1870s, which led directly to the formation of the Normal School of Science, a constituent college of Imperial College London. From 1859 the Science and Art Department had offered examinations for prospective science teachers, and promoted evening classes in science across Britain. From 1872 the Science and Art Department began offering scientific higher education directly through evening classes at the South Kensington site. In 1880 these classes acquired formal recognition as the Normal School of Science. During the 1880s a number of Royal Commissions considered the question of technical education, and their recommendations led to an increasing role in scientific training for other branches of government. The increased attention paid to education led to the formation of the Board of Education in 1899, into which the Science and Art Department was fully integrated.

Vertices are truncated, forming new red rectified cube cells. In geometry, a cantellation is a 2nd order truncation in any dimension that bevels a regular polytope at its edges and at its vertices, creating a new facet in place of each edge and of each vertex. Cantellation also applies to regular tilings and honeycombs. Cantellating is also rectifying its rectification. Cantellation (for polyhedra and tilings) is also called expansion by Alicia Boole Stott: it corresponds to moving the faces of the regular form away from the center, and filling in a new face in the gap for each opened edge and for each opened vertex.

The widening did not lead to a re-extension of the state designation, though, and road remains two lanes wide both under I-75 and into downtown Bushnell until in intersects CR 475 and CR 548\\\\. From there it turns south as a four-lane boulevard before intersecting with US 301\\\\. Returning to its county road status, the former SR 48 runs concurrently with US 301 along East Noble Road, then with CR 476 along North Florida Street and South Florida Street, until it reaches East Seminole Avenue, and turns east before leaving Bushnell's city limits, and heads through the rest of rural Sumter County. North of the city of Webster it intersects with SR 471 as it heads towards Center Hill. Northeast of Center Hill, SR 48 crossed the Sumter‚ÄìLake county line and was named Leesburg Highway. In Okahumpka, the road runs concurrently with CR 33, then turned at 1st Street, taking the designation from CR 470 on its way to SR 19 in Howey-in-the-Hills. Former sections are now designated CR 48 in Citrus, Sumter and Lake counties. CR 48 joins CR 33 in Okahumpka.

It can be ascended from Honister Pass, Seathwaite in Borrowdale, or Ennerdale. There are good views of Gable Crag, Scafell Pike and the Buttermere valley from the summit. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Green Gable stands to the north east of its mightier sibling. Green and Great Gable rise at the head of Ennerdale, the infant River Liza tumbling down from their connecting col, Windy Gap. To their backs they have the walkers' pass of Sty Head, connecting Borrowdale to Wasdale. Green Gable has a footing in Borrowdale only, standing to the north of the pass. It is from Ennerdale that the fell achieves a peaked \\"gabled\\" outline, although only the lower slopes could be considered green- the summit area being a desert of stones. Taking Great Gable as the pivot of the Western Fells, the northward arm begins over Green Gable, before swinging round over Brandreth and Haystacks to begin the long northern wall of Ennerdale. Green Gable also has a secondary ridge to the north east, culminating in the separate fell of Base Brown. Sourmilk Gill Windy Gap (2,460 ft) stands a little way to the south west of the summit, at the bottom of a stony slope. On the Ennerdale side is Stone Cove- not named by chance, they are yards deep while the south eastern descent leads down Aaron Slack. \\"Slack\\" is the dialect word for scree, and this too is a rough chute leading down to Sty Head Pass. Sty Head Tarn lies at the bottom of the Slack, a large pool in a scooped out hollow, the outlet blocked by boulders. It is 30 ft deep and reputed to contain trout.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): Green Gable's eastern face contains the slight hollow of Mitchell Cove, its stream joining Styhead Gill on the way to Borrowdale. At the northern corner is the ridge to Base Brown, the flat topped depression of Blackmoor Pots. The dale between the Base Brown and Brandreth ridges is Gillercomb, a classic hanging valley. Its stream, Sourmilk Gill, exits around the nose of Base Brown via a series of cascades to Seathwaite. This ensures that all of Green Gable's waters, bar those from the western face, reach the River Derwent. Brandreth connects via the narrow ridge of Gillercomb Head, site of a few small pools after wet weather. The Ennerdale side provides the gentlest slopes, at least at lower levels, with the long grassy spur of Tongue gradually rising up the fell. The topmost section however is guarded by Greengable Crags, stretching around from Stone Cove. Geology Summit of Green Gable, from the Great Gable path - showing rough track down to Windy Gap. The summit of Green Gable is overlain by till, although there are outcrops of the Long Top Member to the west and north. This comprises bedded and welded rhyolitic tuff and lapilli-tuff. Above Sty Head there are examples of Scafell dacite and the tuffs and breccias of the Lingmell Formation.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) There is no history of mining on the fell.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Looking NW from Green Gable summit down the Ennerdale valley. Summit Green Gable has a neat summit marked by a cairn and would be a famous spot in its own right but for the looming presence of Great Gable. The summit is the perfect position from which to admire Gable Crag, and in all other directions is undiminished in its view of the Lakeland fells. The view up the Buttermere valley is perhaps the highlight. Ascents Some of the routes are those used for Great Gable, in particular those from the north. From Seathwaite a path runs up beside Sour Milk Gill into Gillercomb. From here it continues up the flank of the Blackmoor Pols ridge and onto the summit. From the top of the Honister Pass road a contouring path runs around Grey Knotts and Brandreth, before ascending Green Gable via Gillercomb Head. This path can also be used to access Moses Trod, a high level route from Honister to Wasdale. \\"Moses\\" was a possibly apocryphal figure in local stories, a quarryman from Honister who doubled as a trader-cum-whisky smuggler between the Lakeland valleys. A route from Seathwaite not designed for the ascent of Great Gable can be found by climbing up Styhead pass and then branching off into Mitchell Cove, following the beck almost to the summit. Aaron Slack can also be used. If starting from Ennerdale a long walk up the valley can culminate in either a climb up Stone Cove to Windy Gap, or a slightly easier ascent of the Tongue to reach Gillercomb Head. Indirect climbs via Brandreth or Base Brown are also possible.Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): References Fells of the Lake District Nuttalls Hewitts of England Allerdale Borough of Copeland ","title":"Green Gable"},{"id":"6317685","text":"Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet There have been five baronetcies created for people with the surname Pollock, one in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia and four in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.

Symptoms can be either rapid or gradual in onset. The latter can take hours to days to appear. The former may include anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition which requires treatment with epinephrine. Other presentations may include atopic dermatitis or inflammation of the esophagus.National Report of the Expert Panel on Food Allergy Research, NIH-NIAID 2003 In the United States, 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by cow's milk, eggs, wheat, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and soy beans.\\"Food Allergy Facts\\" Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America The declaration of the presence of trace amounts of allergens in foods is not mandatory in any country, with the exception of Brazil. Prevention is by avoiding eating eggs and foods that may contain eggs, such as cake or cookies. It is unclear if the early introduction of the eggs to the diet of babies aged 4‚Äì6 months decreases the risk of egg allergies. Egg allergy appears mainly in children but can persist into adulthood. In the United States, it is the second most common food allergy in children after cow's milk. Most children outgrow egg allergy by the age of five, but some people remain allergic for a lifetime.\\"Egg Allergy Facts\\" Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America In North America and Western Europe egg allergy occurs in 0.5% to 2.5% of children under the age of five years. The majority grow out of it by school age, but for roughly one-third, the allergy persists into adulthood. Strong predictors for adult-persistence are anaphylaxis, high egg- specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), robust response to the skin prick test and absence of tolerance to egg-containing baked foods. Signs and symptoms Food allergies usually have a fast onset (from seconds to one hour). Symptoms may include: rash, hives, itching of mouth, lips, tongue, throat, eyes, skin, or other areas, swelling of lips, tongue, eyelids, or the whole face, difficulty swallowing, runny or congested nose, hoarse voice, wheezing, shortness of breath, diarrhea, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, fainting, nausea, or vomiting. Symptoms of allergies vary from person to person and may vary from incident to incident. Serious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. The former can be indicated by wheezing, a blocked airway and cyanosis, the latter by weak pulse, pale skin, and fainting. When these symptoms occur the allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis occurs when IgE antibodies are involved, and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show severe symptoms. Untreated, this can proceed to vasodilation, a low blood pressure situation called anaphylactic shock, and death (very rare). Young children may exhibit dermatitis/eczema on face, scalp and other parts of the body, in older children knees and elbows are more commonly afflicted. Children with dermatitis are at greater than expected risk of also exhibiting asthma and allergic rhinitis. Causes=Eating egg The cause is typically the eating of eggs or foods that contain eggs. Briefly, the immune system over-reacts to proteins found in eggs. This allergic reaction may be triggered by small amounts of egg, even egg incorporated into cooked foods, such as cake. People with an allergy to chicken eggs may also be reactive to goose, duck, or turkey eggs. Vaccines Influenza vaccines are created by injecting a live virus into fertilized chicken eggs. The viruses are harvested, killed and purified, but a residual amount of egg white protein remains. Each year, vaccines are created to provide protection against the flu viruses expected to be prevalent in the upcoming cold weather months. For the 2017-2018 flu season, the vaccines are described as IIV3 and IIV4 for resistance to the expected three or four viruses. For adults ages 18 and older there is also an option to receive recombinant flu vaccines (RIV3 or RIV4) which are grown on mammalian cell cultures instead of in eggs, and so are no risk for people with severe egg allergy. Recommendations are that for people with a history of mild egg allergy should receive any IIV or RIV vaccine. People with a more severe allergic reaction may also receive any IIV or RIV, but in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting, administered by a healthcare provider. People with a known severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine (which could be egg protein or the gelatin or the neomycin components of the vaccine) should not receive a flu vaccine. Each year the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) publishes recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children. In the most recent guidelines, for 2016-2017, a change was made, that children with a history of egg allergy may receive the IIV3 or IIV4 vaccine without special precautions. It does, however, state that \\"Standard vaccination practice should include the ability to respond to acute hypersensitivity reactions.\\" Prior to this, AAP recommended precautions based on egg allergy history: if no history, immunize; if a history of mild reaction, i.e., hives, immunize in a medical setting with healthcare professionals and resuscitative equipment available; if a history of severe reactions, refer to an allergist. The measles and mumps parts of the \\"MMR vaccine\\" (for measles, mumps, and rubella) are cultured on chick embryo cell culture and contain trace amounts of egg protein. The amount of egg protein is lower than in influenza vaccines and the risk of an allergic reaction is much lower. One guideline stated that all infants and children should get the two MMR vaccinations, mentioning that \\"Studies on large numbers of egg-allergic children show there is no increased risk of severe allergic reactions to the vaccines.\\" Another guideline recommended that if a child has a known medical history of severe anaphylaxis reaction to eggs, then the vaccination should be done in a hospital center, and the child be kept for observation for 60 minutes before being allowed to leave. The second guideline also stated that if there was a severe reaction to the first vaccination - which could have been to egg protein or the gelatin and neomycin components of the vaccine - the second is contraindicated. Exercise as a contributing factor There is a condition called food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIAn). Exercise can trigger hives and more severe symptoms of an allergic reaction. For some people with this condition, exercise alone is not sufficient, nor consumption of a food to which they are mildly allergic sufficient, but when the food in question is consumed within a few hours before high intensity exercise, the result can be anaphylaxis. Egg are specifically mentioned as a causative food. One theory is that exercise is stimulating the release of mediators such as histamine from IgE-activated mast cells. Two of the reviews postulate that exercise is not essential for the development of symptoms, but rather that it is one of several augmentation factors, citing evidence that the culprit food in combination with alcohol or aspirin will result in a respiratory anaphylactic reaction. Mechanisms Conditions caused by food allergies are classified into three groups according to the mechanism of the allergic response: # IgE-mediated (classic) ‚Äì the most common type, manifesting acute changes that occur shortly after eating, and may progress to anaphylaxis # Non-IgE mediated ‚Äì characterized by an immune response not involving immunoglobulin E; may occur hours to days after eating, complicating diagnosis # IgE and non-IgE-mediated ‚Äì a hybrid of the above two types Allergic reactions are hyperactive responses of the immune system to generally innocuous substances, such as proteins in the foods we eat. Why some proteins trigger allergic reactions while others do not is not entirely clear, although in part thought to be due to resistance to digestion. Because of this, intact or largely intact proteins reach the small intestine, which has a large presence of white blood cells involved in immune reactions.Food Reactions. Allergies . Foodreactions.org. Kent, England. 2005. Accessed 27 Apr 2010. The heat of cooking structurally degrades protein molecules, potentially making them less allergenic.Mayo Clinic. Causes of Food Allergies. April 2010. The pathophysiology of allergic responses can be divided into two phases. The first is an acute response that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen. This phase can either subside or progress into a \\"late-phase reaction\\" which can substantially prolong the symptoms of a response, and result in more tissue damage. In the early stages of acute allergic reaction, lymphocytes previously sensitized to a specific protein or protein fraction react by quickly producing a particular type of antibody known as secreted IgE (sIgE), which circulates in the blood and binds to IgE-specific receptors on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils. Both of these are involved in the acute inflammatory response. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators called (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth-muscle contraction. This results in runny nose, itchiness, shortness of breath, and potentially anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, the allergen, and the mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems; asthma is localized to the respiratory system while eczema is localized to the skin. After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late-phase responses can often occur due to the migration of other white blood cells such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages to the initial reaction sites. This is usually seen 2‚Äì24 hours after the original reaction. Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects. Late-phase responses seen in asthma are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses, although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils. Five major allergenic proteins from the egg of the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus) have been identified; these are designated Gal d 1-5. Four of these are in egg white: ovomucoid (Gal d 1), ovalbumin (Gal d 2), ovotransferrin (Gal d 3) and lysozyme (Gal d 4). Of these, ovomucoid is the dominant allergen, and one that is less likely to be outgrown as children get older. Ingestion of under-cooked egg may trigger more severe clinical reactions than well-cooked egg. In egg yolk, alpha-livetin (Gal d 5) is the major allergen, but various vitellins may also trigger a reaction. People allergic to alpha-livetin may experience respiratory symptoms such as rhinitis and/or asthma when exposed to chickens, because the yolk protein is also found in live birds. In addition to IgE-mediated responses, egg allergy can manifest as atopic dermatitis, especially in infants and young children. Some will display both, so that a child could react to an oral food challenge with allergic symptoms, followed a day or two later with a flare up of atopic dermatitis and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, including allergic eosinophilic esophagitis. Non-allergic intolerance Egg whites, which are potentially histamine liberators, also provoke a nonallergic response in some people. In this situation, proteins in egg white directly trigger the release of histamine from mast cells. Because this mechanism is classified as a pharmacological reaction, or \\"pseudoallergy\\", the condition is considered a food intolerance instead of a true immunoglobulin E (IgE) based allergic reaction. The response is usually localized, typically in the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, or any other symptoms typical to histamine release. If sufficiently strong, it can result in an anaphylactoid reaction, which is clinically indistinguishable from true anaphylaxis. Some people with this condition tolerate small quantities of egg whites. They are more often able to tolerate well-cooked eggs, such as found in cake or dried egg-based pasta, than incompletely cooked eggs, such as fried eggs or meringues, or uncooked eggs. Diagnosis Diagnosis of egg allergy is based on the person's history of allergic reactions, skin prick test (SPT), patch test and measurement of egg-specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE or sIgE). Confirmation is by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. SPT and sIgE have sensitivity greater than 90% but specificity in the 50-60% range, meaning these tests will detect an egg sensitivity, but will also be positive for other allergens. For young children, attempts have been made to identify SPT and sIgE responses strong enough to avoid the need for a confirming oral food challenge. Prevention When eggs are introduced to a baby's diet is thought to affect risk of developing allergy, but there are contradictory recommendations. A 2016 review acknowledged that introducing peanuts early appears to have a benefit, but stated \\"The effect of early introduction of egg on egg allergy are controversial.\\" A meta-analysis published the same year supported the theory that early introduction of eggs into an infant's diet lowers risk, and a review of allergens in general stated that introducing solid foods at 4‚Äì6 months may result in the lowest subsequent allergy risk. However, an older consensus document from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology recommended that introduction of chicken eggs be delayed to 24 months of age. Treatment The mainstay of treatment is total avoidance of egg protein intake. This is complicated because the declaration of the presence of trace amounts of allergens in foods is not mandatory (see regulation of labelling). Treatment for accidental ingestion of egg products by allergic individuals varies depending on the sensitivity of the person. An antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may be prescribed. Sometimes prednisone will be prescribed to prevent a possible late phase Type I hypersensitivity reaction. Severe allergic reactions (anaphalaxis) may require treatment with an epinephrine pen, i.e., an injection device designed to be used by a non-healthcare professional when emergency treatment is warranted. Immunotherapy There is active research on trying oral immunotherapy (OIT) to desensitize people to egg allergens. A Cochrane Review concluded that OIT can desensitize people, but it remains unclear whether long-term tolerance develops after treatment ceases, and 69% of the people enrolled in the trials had adverse effects. They concluded there was a need for standardized protocols and guidelines prior to incorporating OIT into clinical practice. A second review noted that allergic reactions, up to anaphylaxis, can occur during OIT, and recommends this treatment not be routine medical practice. A third review limited its scope to trials of baked egg-containing goods such as bread or cake as a means of resolving egg allergy. Again, there were some successes, but also some severe allergic reactions, and the authors came down on the side of not recommending this as treatment. Avoiding eggs Prevention of egg-allergic reactions means avoiding eggs and egg-containing foods. People with an allergy to chicken eggs may also be allergic to other types of eggs, such as goose, duck, or turkey eggs. In cooking, eggs are multifunctional: they may act as an emulsifier to reduce oil/water separation (mayonnaise), a binder (water binding and particle adhesion, as in meatloaf), or an aerator (cakes, especially angel food). Some commercial egg substitutes can substitute for particular functions (potato starch and tapioca for water binding, whey protein for aeration or particle binding, or soy lecithin or avocado for emulsification). Food companies produce egg-free mayonnaise and other replacement foods. Alfred Bird invented egg-free Bird's Custard, the original version of what is known generically as custard powder today. Most people find it necessary to strictly avoid any item containing eggs, including: * Albumin (egg white protein) * Apovitellin (egg yolk protein) * Egg Beaters (cholesterol-free, uses egg whites) * Dried egg solids, powdered egg * Egg, egg white, egg yolk * Egg wash * Eggnog * Fat substitutes (some) * Livetin (egg yolk protein) * Lysozyme (egg white protein) * Mayonnaise * Meringue or meringue powder * Ovalbumin (egg white protein) * Ovoglobulin (egg white protein) * Ovomucin (egg white protein) * Ovomucoid (egg white protein) * Ovotransferrin (egg white protein) * Ovovitelia (egg yolk protein) * Ovovitellin (egg yolk protein) * Silici albuminate * Simplesse * Vitellin (egg yolk protein) Ingredients that sometimes include egg protein include: artificial flavoring, natural flavoring, lecithin and nougat candy. Probiotic products have been tested, and some found to contain milk and egg proteins which were not always indicated on the labels. Prognosis The majority of children outgrow egg allergy. One review reported that 70% of children will outgrow this allergy by 16 years. In subsequently published longitudinal studies, one reported that for 140 infants who had challenge- confirmed egg allergy, 44% had resolved by two years. A second reported that for 203 infants with confirmed IgE-mediated egg allergy, 45% resolved by two years of age, 66% by four years, and 71% by six years. Children will be able to tolerate eggs as an ingredient in baked goods and well-cooked eggs sooner than under-cooked eggs. Resolution was more likely if baseline serum IgE was lower, and if the baseline symptoms did not include anaphylaxis. Epidemiology In countries in North America and western Europe, where use of cow's milk based infant formula is common, chicken egg allergy is the second most common food allergy in infants and young children after cow's milk. However, in Japan, egg allergy is first and cow's milk second, followed by wheat and then the other common allergenic foods. A review from South Africa reported egg and peanut as the two most common allergenic foods. Incidence and prevalence are terms commonly used in describing disease epidemiology. Incidence is newly diagnosed cases, which can be expressed as new cases per year per million people. Prevalence is the number of cases alive, expressible as existing cases per million people during a period of time.\\"Incidence and Prevalence\\" Advanced Renal Education Program (Accessed 17 October 2017). Egg allergies are usually observed in infants and young children, and often disappear with age (see Prognosis), so prevalence of egg allergy may be expressed as a percentage of children under a set age. One review estimates that in North American and western European populations the prevalence of egg allergy in children under the age of five years is 1.8-2.0%. A second described the range in young children as 0.5-2.5%. Although the majority of children develop tolerance as they age into school age years, for roughly one-third the allergy persists into adulthood. Strong predictors for adult-persistent allergy are anaphylactic symptoms as a child, high egg- specific serum IgE, robust response to the skin prick test and absence of tolerance to egg-containing baked foods. Self-reported allergy prevalence is always higher than food-challenge confirmed allergy. For all age groups, a review of fifty studies conducted in Europe estimated 2.5% for self-reported egg allergy and 0.2% for confirmed. National survey data in the United States collected in 2005 and 2006 showed that from age six and older, the prevalence of serum IgE confirmed egg allergy was under 0.2%. Adult-onset of egg allergy is rare, but there is confirmation of cases. Some were described as having started in late teenage years; another group were workers in the baking industry who were exposed to powdered egg dust. Society and culture Whether food allergy prevalence is increasing or not, food allergy awareness has definitely increased, with impacts on the quality of life for children, their parents and their immediate caregivers. In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package, and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus. The Culinary Institute of America, a premier school for chef training, has courses in allergen-free cooking and a separate teaching kitchen.Culinary Institute of America Allergen-free oasis comes to the CIA (2017) School systems have protocols about what foods can be brought into the school. Despite all these precautions, people with serious allergies are aware that accidental exposure can easily occur at other peoples' houses, at school or in restaurants. Food fear has a significant impact on quality of life. Finally, for children with allergies, their quality of life is also affected by actions of their peers. There is an increased occurrence of bullying, which can include threats or acts of deliberately being touched with foods they need to avoid, also having their allergen-free food deliberately contaminated. Regulation of labelling An example of a list of allergens in a food item In response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain major allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods. Nevertheless, there are no labeling laws to mandatory declare the presence of trace amounts in the final product as a consequence of cross- contamination, except in Brazil.\\"Food allergen labelling and information requirements under the EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation No. 1169/2011: Technical Guidance\\" (April 2015). =Ingredients intentionally added= In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains any of these eight major food allergens, added intentionally: cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat. This list originated in 1999 from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission. To meet FALCPA labeling requirements, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have its \\"food sourced name\\" in parentheses, for example \\"Casein (milk),\\" or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: \\"Contains milk\\" (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling). The European Union requires listing for those eight major allergens plus molluscs, celery, mustard, lupin, sesame and sulfites. FALCPA applies to packaged foods regulated by the FDA, which does not include poultry, most meats, certain egg products, and most alcoholic beverages. However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients. These products are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name. Neither the identification of the source of a specific ingredient in a parenthetical statement nor the use of statements to alert for the presence of specific ingredients, like \\"Contains: milk\\", are mandatory according to FSIS. FALCPA also does not apply to food prepared in restaurants. The EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 ‚Äì requires food businesses to provide allergy information on food sold unpackaged, for example, in catering outlets, deli counters, bakeries and sandwich bars. In the United States, there is no federal mandate to address the presence of allergens in drug products. FALCPA does not apply to medicines nor to cosmetics. =Trace amounts as a result of cross- contamination= The value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial. This concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of cross-contact or cross-contamination at any point along the food chain (during raw material transportation, storage or handling, due to shared equipment for processing and packaging, etc.). Experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers, and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers, ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling, threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose, and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated. Labeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling, termed precautionary allergen labeling (PAL), also known as ‚Äúmay contain‚Äù statements, for possible, inadvertent, trace amount, cross- contamination during production. PAL labeling can be confusing to consumers, especially as there can be many variations on the wording of the warning. PAL is regulated only in Switzerland, Japan, Argentina, and South Africa. Argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010, and instead puts the onus on the manufacturer to control the manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in the products. South Africa does not permit the use of PAL, except when manufacturers demonstrate the potential presence of allergen due to cross-contamination through a documented risk assessment and despite adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice. In Australia and New Zealand there is a recommendation that PAL be replaced by guidance from VITAL 2.0 (Vital Incidental Trace Allergen Labeling). A review identified \\"the eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1% of the population\\" as ED01. This threshold reference dose for foods such as cow's milk, egg, peanut and other proteins) will provide food manufacturers with guidance for developing precautionary labeling and give consumers a better idea of might be accidentally in a food product beyond \\"may contain.\\" VITAL 2.0 was developed by the Allergen Bureau, a food industry sponsored, non-government organization.The VITAL Program Allergen Bureau, Australia and New Zealand. The European Union has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but is not expected to publish such before 2024. In Brazil since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. These allergens include wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybrids, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybean, milk of all species of mammalians, almonds, hazelnuts, cashew nuts, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecan nuts, pistaches, pine nuts, and chestnuts.

Red: Guelders, Groningen, and Frisia. The Guelders Wars () were a series of conflicts in the Low Countries between the Duke of Burgundy, who controlled Holland, Flanders, Brabant, and Hainaut on the one side, and Charles, Duke of Guelders, who controlled Guelders, Groningen, and Frisia on the other side. The wars lasted from 1502 till 1543 and ended with a Burgundian victory. With this outcome, all of the Low Countries were now under the control of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The conflicts were characterised by the absence of large battles between the armies of both parties. Instead small hit and run actions, raids, and ambushes were common practices. Regardless, the impact on civilians was large with hostilities and incidents occurring throughout the Low Countries. The wars included the sack of The Hague in 1528 and the failed siege of Antwerp in 1542 under the command of the Guelderian field marshal Maarten van Rossum. The war ended with the total destruction and death of nearly all inhabitants of the town of D√ºren after which the other Gueldrian towns surrendered to Habsburg rule by the Treaty of Venlo. The latter portion of the wars intersected with the larger conflict between France and Spain known as the Italian Wars.  Background  The origins of the Guelders Wars is traced back to 1471, when Charles the Bold lent 300,000 gold guilders to Arnold, Duke of Guelders. As a \\"bail\\", in order to protect himself in case he would not be repaid, Charles chose the title of the Duchy of Guelders. Arnold did not pay the sum back, and thus, when he died in 1473, Charles the Bold assumed the title to the duchy. Arnold's son Adolf and subsequently grandson Charles, decided to take back the duchy by military means.  1502-1514  Between 1502 and 1515, the Habsburgs tried without success to reconquer the Duchy of Guelders, which had belonged to the House of Burgundy between 1473 and 1492.Ward, pp. 173-196. On the other hand, Charles, Duke of Guelders, tried to conquer Overijssel which belonged to the Bishopric of Utrecht, also without success.  1514-1517 In this period, the Saxon feud was fought, in which George, Duke of Saxony, allied with the Habsburgs, tried to subdue Frisia, the Ommelanden, and Groningen. The Frisians under the leadership of Jancko Douwama resisted and were supported by Edzard I, Count of East Frisia, and the inimitable Charles, Duke of Guelders. George of Saxony failed to conquer Groningen and was pushed back. When he held only a handful of cities (Leeuwarden, Harlingen en Franeker), he sold his rights to Charles of Habsburg in May 1515. In the meantime, the Frisian rebels, led by the legendary Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijerd Jelckama, won many battles at sea and raided through Holland at the head of the Arumer Zwarte Hoop. Because Charles of Habsburg needed to consolidate the Spanish throne and manoeuver to become Holy Roman Emperor in Germany, he concluded peace with Edzard I, recognizing him as Count of East-Frisia and with Charles, Duke of Guelders, leaving him in control of most of Frisia, the Ommelanden, and Groningen. Charles of Guelders consequently conquered Overijssel in 1521-1522, with the support of Zwolle.  1522-1528  In 1522, the Habsburg force under Georg Schenck van Toutenburg resumed the offensive and pushed the Guelders forces the following year out of Frisia. Furthermore, the Frisians rebels, whose charismatic leader Pier Gerlofs Donia had died from illness in 1520, were also defeated. Their leader Wijerd Jelckama and what was left of the Frisian army were captured in 1523, taken to the city of Leeuwarden and publicly beheaded. Jancko Douwama was also taken prisoner and died in captivity in Vilvoorde. By December 1524, Frisia was firmly in the hands of the Habsburg. It was renamed into the Lordship of Frisia and ruled by a Stadtholder. Henry of the Palatinate, the new Prince-Bishop of Utrecht, was in conflict with his own Utrecht citizens, who invited troops from Guelders to occupy the city. Henry had no choice but to ask Charles of Habsburg for help. The States of Overijssel also asked Charles to liberate their lands from Guelders. Charles of Habsburg demanded a price, namely that they recognized him as Lord, to which they agreed. Schenck van Toutenburg moved his army into Overijssel and Utrecht and easily chased the Guelders troops, who had already become very unpopular amongst the population. On October 20, 1528, Bishop Henry handed over power to Charles of Habsburg. The Bishopric of Utrecht came to an end and was divided into the Lordship of Utrecht and the Lordship of Overijssel, both ruled by a Habsburg Stadtholder. A daring raid through Holland, culminating in the sack of The Hague by Maarten van Rossum, Field Marshal of Guelders, didn't prevent Schenk van Toutenburg to attack some cities in Guelders, after which Charles of Guelders agreed to sign the Treaty of Gorinchem on October 3, 1528.  1534-1536  In 1534, the Danish Count's Feud spilled over into the Low Countries when Habsburg supported Enno II, Count of East Frisia, ally of Christopher of Oldenburg and Charles, Duke of Guelders, supported Balthasar Oomkens von Esens, ally of Christian III of Denmark. In May 1536, Meindert van Ham, supported by Denmark and Guelders, invaded Groningen and threatened Holland. As a reaction, Holland gathered a fleet to lift the siege of Copenhagen, and Habsburg sent Schenck van Toutenburg to chase the enemy troops from Groningen. Schenck van Toutenburg was allowed to occupy the City of Groningen and defeated Meindert van Ham in the Battle of Heiligerlee (1536). Before the Dutch fleet was ready to sail, Copenhagen fell in the hands of Christian III of Denmark, and peace was concluded. Habsburg became master of Groningen and Drenthe, which was renamed Lordship of Groningen and County of Drenthe. Charles of Guelders was forced to sign the Treaty of Grave.  1538-1543  When Charles of Guelders died without an heir on June 30, 1538, he had done everything he could to find another successor than Emperor Charles V. He had appointed William, Duke of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg, related through his great-grandfather Reinald IV, Duke of Guelders and J√ºlich (1365-1423), as his successor. William allied himself with the King of France and married Jeanne d'Albret. When the Low Countries were at war with France, he sent in 1542 Maarten van Rossum on a raid through Brabant, plundering the countryside and besieging Antwerp and Leuven. These attacks were countered by Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands) and Louis of Praet. As a reaction, Mary of Hungary sent an army toward Guelders and J√ºlich, which were conquered in 1543, after two failed earlier attempts. In the Treaty of Venlo, William of J√ºlich was forced to cede the Duchy of Guelders and the County of Zutphen to Charles V, but was allowed to keep J√ºlich. This treaty concluded the formation of the Seventeen Provinces.

Overview Core Animation provides a way for developers to produce animated user interfaces via an implicit animation model as well as an \\"explicit\\" model. The developer specifies the original and final states of an object, and Core Animation handles interpolation. This allows animated interfaces to be created with relative ease, as no specific code for the animation is required by the developer. Core Animation can animate any visual element, and it provides a unified way of accessing Core Image, Core Video, and the other Quartz technologies. Core Animation rendering can be accelerated by a graphics processor (GPU). Animated sequences execute in a thread independent from the main run loop, allowing application processing to occur while the animation is in progress. In this way, application performance is not affected, and animations can be stopped, reversed, or retargeted while in progress. History Core Animation first appeared in Mac OS X Leopard, but actually first emerged from the iPhone software team. It was shown publicly for the first time on August 7, 2006Apple Worldwide Developers Conference#2000s during WWDC 2006.

The school has since been replaced by the new Bridgeport Elementary, located in the city limits. Several churches now hold the community together, since the Bridgeport Ruritan Club closed in 2011. Name The name of the community is believed to have come from the two covered bridges that existed in the area, one over Armstrong's Branch and the other over South Benson Creek. Benson Creek was itself named after Richard Benson, who was a part of one of the first explorations of the region in 1774, whereas Armstrong Branch was named after one of the first nearby landowners, William Armstrong, who purchased his 300 acres of land in 1784. Neither covered bridge exists to this day. Education Bridgeport was the original location of the Bridgeport Elementary School. The schoolhouse for the community was constructed in 1851 and would see further expansions through the years until it destroyed by a fire. It was replaced with the current building in 1942 and was at the time designed to service both elementary and high school studentson the first and second floors, respectively. The building was closed in 2005 and Bridgeport Elementary was moved to its current location within Frankfort next to both the local middle and high schools.

The death fold is a tertiary structure motif commonly found in proteins involved in apoptosis or inflammation-related processes. This motif is commonly found in domains that participate in protein‚Äìprotein interactions leading to the formation of large functional complexes. Examples of death fold domains include the death domain (DD), death effector domain (DED), Caspase Recruitment Domain (CARD), and pyrin domain (PYD). Death fold domains are an evolutionarily conserved superfamily of domains that mediate apoptotic signaling. The two types of apoptosis, extrinsic and intrinsic, are tightly regulated by the interplay of activating and inhibitory pathways. The interactions between the four different death fold motifs are a unifying mechanism in both types of apoptosis.  Structure  There is a large difference in the primary amino acid sequence of the four different death fold motifs, but each has a similar three-dimensional structure. Death-fold motifs are characterized by six to seven tightly coiled alpha-helices arranged in a \\"Greek-key\\" fold. The motifs consist of several defined protein interactions with other suspected apoptotic roles (Lahm).  Four death-fold domains  Caspase recruitment domain (CARD) CARD-containing proteins are found throughout the animal kingdom and may also be present in fungi, plants, and prokaryotes. CARD domains are present on several mammalian procaspases, and have functions in apoptosis, cytokine processing, immune defense, and NF-Œ∫B activation. In insects and nematodes, CARDs so far seem restricted to apoptotic proteins. Death domain (DD) DDs are found primarily in vertebrates (although they are also present in some other animals). DDs are contained on cytokine receptors in the TNF receptor family. DD proteins function in apoptosis and NF-Œ∫B signaling in mammals, but only NF-Œ∫B signaling Drosophila. Death effector domain (DED) DEDs are present on caspases and are involved in caspase activation. DED-containing caspases function in death receptor-induced apoptosis in mammals, but differ in insects where they are involved in NF-Œ∫B signaling and antibacterial responses. PYRIN PYRINS are the most recently discovered death-fold domain, and their functions and interactions have yet to be clearly elucidated.  Binding and interactions  Death-fold motifs are believed to exert their effects solely through monovalent, homotypic interactions. In these interactions death-folds bind to another death-fold containing domain through the same type of protein interaction domain. These interactions are highly specific, and there are no known interactions between different types of death-fold domains ‚Äì in every known case the binding partners have homologous domain (DD-DD, CARD-CARD, DED- DED). The role of these homotypic interactions is thought to be self-assembly (Lahm). This results in large multi-subunit structures made of only one type of protein.

Originally built in 1832 by General Francis Preston, hero of the War of 1812, for his family of nine children, over the course of the last 174 years, the building has served as an upscale women's college, a Civil War hospital and barracks, and as a residence for visiting actors of the Barter Theatre. In addition to hotel services, the inn now offers spa treatments. Many people say the house might be haunted by ghosts from the area. The Martha Washington Hotel & Spa is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History In 1832, General Francis Preston built the brick residence for his family at a cost of $15,000.The Martha Washington Inn site The mansion remained in the Preston family possession until 1858, when it was sold at the cost of $21,000 to the founders of Martha Washington College. The college devoted entirely to women operated for seventy years until finally succumbing to the Great Depression. At the time of the Civil War, the college served as the training ground for the Confederate unit, the Washington Mounted Rifles. After various skirmishes between United States and Confederate forces, wounded were brought to the school for treatment. It was also during this time period that the building attained the nickname, \\"The Martha.\\" Among its post-war alumnae was the valedictorian of the Class of 1880, Nellie Nugent Somerville, who would go on to become the first woman elected to the Mississippi Legislature. The architectural integrity of the Martha has been preserved for over 150 years. The original living room of the Preston family is now the main lobby of the inn. One of the original items owned by the Preston family is the Dutch- baroque grandfather clock which measures over nine feet tall. This beautiful clock, which was shipped from England by one of the Preston daughters, now takes its rightful place in the East Parlor of the inn. After passing through various hands over the next three years, in 1935, the Martha Washington Inn opened. The inn has operated ever since in the capacity of a hotel. In 1984, the United Group, an investment group of businessmen, purchased the inn and paid for an 8 million dollar renovation. Eleven years later, the property was admitted to the Camberley Collection of historic places. Today, the Martha Washington Inn serves as both a hotel and spa. Famous guests Many famous guests have spent the night at the Martha Washington Inn. Among them are included, Eleanor Roosevelt, President Harry Truman, Lady Bird Johnson, Jimmy Carter, and Elizabeth Taylor. The hotel has also played host to actors performing at the Barter Theatre, which is adjacent to the inn, but now the actors usually stay at the Barter Inn. Ghosts *The Yankee sweetheart This story is about a tragic love affair between a student at Martha Washington College and her Yankee sweetheart. Although still a girl's college, Martha Washington College served as a hospital during the Civil War. Several of the girls did not return home during the war but bravely volunteered to stay at the school as nurses. Captain John Stoves, a Yankee officer, was severely wounded and captured in town. Soldiers carried Capt. Stoves through the cave system under Abingdon and up a secret stairway to the third floor of the building. Capt. Stoves lay gravely wounded in what is now Room 403. For weeks, a young student named Beth nursed and cared for him. She found herself falling in love with the brave captain, and he returned her sentiments. Often, Beth would lovingly play the violin to ease his pain and suffering. But, their love was not to last for long. As he lay dying, he called, \\"Play something, Beth, I'm going.\\" Unfortunately, Beth was too late to escort him out with a song, because he died suddenly. Beth tearfully played a sweet southern melody as a tribute to him. When a Confederate officer entered and explained that he was taking Captain Stoves as a prisoner, Beth faced him triumphantly and said, \\"He has been pardoned by an officer higher than General Lee. Captain Stoves is dead.\\" Beth died a few weeks later from typhoid fever. Many of the female students who later attended the college, as well as inn employees and guests, have heard Beth's sweet violin music in the night. Others report that Beth visits Room 403 to comfort her Yankee soldier.Warmuth, 4, 5 * Reappearing Bloodstain A young Confederate soldier in Abingdon was assigned to carry important papers about the location of the Union army to General Robert E. Lee. He was hopelessly in love with a young woman at the college. Knowing the risks he was facing, the brave soldier felt he must say farewell to his lady love before leaving. The soldier traveled through the cave system underlying Abingdon and used a secret stairway to enter the college. As the soldier was saying goodbye to his love, two Union officers came up the stairs and found them. With no way to escape, the young Confederate soldier was shot in front of his sweetheart, and, when he fell, his blood stained the floor. The strange thing is that through the years, the bloodstain continues to appear. Carpets over the area often develop mysterious holes over the stains. Even after the floors have been refinished, the stain continues to reappear, a sad reminder of the tragedy of the Civil War.Warmuth, 5, 6 *The Phantom Horse A phantom horse waits for his master outside the front steps, a Union soldier that was shot in front of the house in 1864. On moonless nights, the horse has been seen roaming the grounds searching for his owner and awaiting the call to ride home. *The Basement Walls The basement holds the spirits of black slaves, they were kept in an underground chamber and some were buried within its stone walls. *The Trail Of Mud Numerous accounts of a soldier hobbling with help from a crutch and leaving a trail of mud in his wake have been reported from a hallway of the Inn. Long past medical help, there is only speculation why he is here at the old hospital, a ball leaving only a hideous mangle of bone and sparse flesh had split his head. *The Angry Spirit In The Tunnel A tunnel once connected the Martha Washington Inn with the Barter Theatre. The entrance on the inn's side has been closed off for several years, but the section below the theater is still used to run electrical cables. Actors who used the tunnel to walk between the inn and the theater in the 1930s and 1940s reported encountering a malevolent spirit. The specter was never seen but sensed as a strong evil presence. The spirit is believed to be either a man who was killed when the tunnel collapsed in 1890 or a Confederate soldier who used the tunnel to smuggle ammunition out of the inn's basement during the Civil War.Kermeen, Frances.

She is portrayed by Shawnee Smith. At first a minor character in the original film, her role expanded in the sequels, giving further backstory into her character. Fictional character biography=Saw Amanda in the Reverse Bear Trap. Amanda's first appearance was as a minor character in the 2004 film Saw. She was the only known survivor of the Jigsaw Killer (John Kramer), a man who abducts people he sees as unappreciative of their lives and forces them into death traps. Her trap is depicted in a flashback while it is described to police and Dr. Lawrence Gordon: she wakes up with a device attached to her head set to rip her jaws open. The key is in the stomach of her \\"dead cellmate\\", who has actually been heavily sedated; she nevertheless kills him and frees herself moments before the device springs open. David Tapp comments that Amanda was targeted by Jigsaw for that game because she was a drug addict. At the end of the scene, she remarks that Jigsaw helped her. Saw II It is revealed in Saw II that Amanda started using heroin in jail. She was sentenced to prison after being framed by Detective Eric Matthews for a crime she did not commit. She appears in most of the film as one of the subjects John traps in the Nerve Gas House along with several other people who Eric had framed, as well as the detective's son, Daniel. As the last surviving female in the Nerve Gas House, it seems that her character is filling the role of a final girl of the film, yet this is a red herring. In a twist ending it is revealed that Amanda is working with John, seeing him as a father figure and agreeing to become his apprentice. Amanda claims that the test she experienced in the first film ultimately saved her life, and this is what caused her to join him. She survives the nerve gas house, saved from the violent victim Xavier by Daniel, and upon the arrival of Eric Matthews she abducts him as her first \\"test subject\\" and rescues John from his custody. Amanda expresses vengeful tendencies toward Eric as she tells him that the \\"tables have turned\\" and that she will make him experience what it is like to be imprisoned, as she traps him in a bathroom to rot. At the end of the film Amanda claims that she intends to carry on John's work after he dies. Saw III Amanda with John. Saw III specified that Amanda had been working with John since the first film, that she kidnapped one of the film's protagonists, Adam Stanheight, and that she had killed Adam out of guilt shortly after said film. Flashbacks in Saw III also clarified that Eric had escaped from his trap, and engaged in a vicious fight with Amanda for the whereabouts of his son. Amanda succeeded in defeating him, and left Eric for dead. By the third film, Amanda is depicted as ignoring John's modus operandi by creating inescapable traps that kill the subject regardless of whether or not they successfully complete their test. She also displays tendencies of cutting herself under stress. The dying John decides to put Amanda through a test to see if she is still stable enough to carry on his work by having her work with Dr. Lynn Denlon to keep him alive while she oversees the tests of Jeff Denlon. Amanda acts abusively toward Lynn, jealous of the attention John is giving her, even having a fight with her at one point. At one point, she goes into another room to find an envelope that John told her about before his surgery; she finds a letter inside it which causes her even more distress, and, upon reading its contents, she breaks down and cries. While John is being operated on, he becomes delirious and professes his love for his ex-wife, but which Amanda mistakes as an undeserved professed love for Lynn. Amanda becomes angry and refuses to remove the shotgun collar from Lynn, which will kill her if John flatlines. A heated argument about John's ethics and whether or not Lynn learned anything ensues, revealing that Amanda made her traps inescapable because she felt that the victims wouldn't have learned anything from the test they were put through, and ending with Amanda shooting Lynn in the abdomen just as Jeff walks in. Jeff witnesses this and shoots Amanda in the neck. As she dies, a saddened John explains the nature of her test - Lynn and Jeff are in fact husband and wife ‚Äì and expresses disappointment at her effectively defeating the point of his actions by giving her victims no chance to learn from their tests. A deleted scene in Saw III shows Amanda killing Eric, cutting his body several times while on top of him. Darren Lynn Bousman fought to keep this scene in, but the producers removed it because they thought it would be better to leave the door open for Eric's return in Saw IV. Leigh Whannell confirms on the Saw III DVD commentary that Amanda murdering Eric was the first time she killed out of spite and that it was this incident which caused her to stray from John's intentions. Two deleted scenes were included in the Saw III Director's Cut DVD. The first was a flashback which showed Amanda meeting Adam in his apartment building prior to abducting him for Jigsaw's game. Adam complimented Amanda's hair, gave her a flyer promoting a friend's concert, and flirtatiously took a photo of her. The second deleted scene took place between Amanda and Lynn in which they engaged in a fight that resulted in cuts on Amanda's arms. It is also notated in the ‚ÄúSaw III‚Äù Leigh Whannell commentary that Amanda‚Äôs caricature was abused by her dad as a child though never seen in any of the Saw movie‚Äôs. Saw IV During Saw IV, Amanda's ability to pick up the much heavier Kerry's unconscious body is questioned by the FBI, leading them to believe another accomplice is helping John. It is discovered that the events of Saw III and Saw IV occurred at the same time, revealing that Amanda was alive during the events of the fourth film. Her blood-covered corpse is found by Agent Peter Strahm in the makeshift operating room just moments after her death. It is later revealed that Detective Mark Hoffman, John's other apprentice, wrote the upsetting letter to Amanda in the previous film. Saw V Amanda reappeared in Saw V, though only through flashbacks and voice appearances. On August 7, 2008, Shawnee Smith confirmed in an interview with Bloody-Disgusting that she had heard she would indeed be featured in the fifth installment of Saw. However, she claimed that she was never on set for the fifth film. Smith guessed that her reappearance will most likely be through the use of archive footage that had been previously filmed.\\"Bloody-Disgusting Dead or Alive, Shawnee Smith Returns Fifth 'Saw' Film\\". Retrieved 12 August 2008 In the fifth film Mark Hoffman questioned, in a flashback, why Amanda would be needed to be involved in the nerve gas house trap (from the second film). Amanda is briefly seen in this flashback, lying unconscious on the ground as John and Hoffman set up that game. In another flashback, in the operating room seen in Saw III, Hoffman questioned John as to why he was letting emotional attachment get in the way of his perception of Amanda. Hoffman also predicted that she would fail John. He then left the room through a secret exit shortly before Amanda entered the room with Lynn. Saw VI Amanda in Jill's clinic with Cecil, who was one of the causes of the death of John and Jill's unborn baby, as seen in a flashback of Saw IV and in more detail in Saw VI. In Saw VI, a flashback showed that Amanda, desperate for drugs, sent Cecil into Jill's clinic to steal some for her, making her an accessory in the miscarriage of Gideon in Saw IV. It was also shown that following Amanda's survival of her test in the first film, John also showed Amanda to Jill to prove that his method of rehabilitation was the only one that worked. It is hinted that Amanda was a patient at Jill's clinic once and that Jill had given up on her. Amanda told Jill that John's method helped her. Amanda appeared in a flashback with John and Mark Hoffman as they put Timothy Young into his trap. It was shown that Amanda and Hoffman, although both apprentices to John, had a very competitive and tense rivalry with each other. Amanda openly expressed doubt in Hoffman's abilities to set up the mechanics of their devices properly, remarking that she thought he was only useful for \\"heavy lifting\\". Hoffman in turn openly expressed his dislike for her, saying he was the one who truly cherishes his life. Amanda also questioned whether Hoffman should be tested, reflecting upon the fact that she had already passed a test. Amanda's close emotional attachment and care for John was also further displayed. Amanda appeared awkward and uncomfortable when she and John later ran into Jill as they exited the room. It was also revealed that the masked figure that kidnapped Lynn in Saw III was Amanda. Another flashback showed Hoffman had plotted to sabotage Amanda's final test in Saw III. Hoffman, knowing of Amanda's involvement in Jill's miscarriage, blackmailed Amanda into killing Lynn Denlon through the letter he left for her in Saw IV (read by her in Saw III). In the letter, Hoffman told Amanda he would inform John of Amanda's indirect role in the incident. Feeling the pressure not to disappoint her mentor, Amanda complied with Hoffman's threats and shot Lynn. This resulted in Amanda's failure to pass the final test John had set for her and thus her death. In the Director's Cut of Saw VI, one of the reinserted scenes presents a dialogue between Amanda and Cecil, in which she persuades him to rob the clinic by claiming, \\"I've been good to you.\\" Also in the Director's Cut a scene was added after the end credits in which she approaches the room Corbett Denlon is locked in (during the events of Saw III) and frantically tells her, \\"Don't trust the one who saves you.\\" Saw 3D Amanda appears in a quick flashback of the bathroom at the end of Saw 3D. Jigsaw Although Amanda does not appear in the eighth film, Jigsaw, it is revealed that John was assisted by Logan Nelson in preparing the \\"Reverse Bear Trap\\" for the game of which she survived in the first film. In other media=Saw: Rebirth The character of Amanda Young is also featured in the comic book, Saw: Rebirth, which is set prior to the events of the first movie. It is revealed that while receiving treatment in hospital for his illness, John Kramer first notices Amanda. She is portrayed as a fellow patient at the hospital who was being treated for an overdose that she had suffered, due to her drug addiction. John expressed frustration that Amanda did not learn anything from her overdose. This motivates John to design her test which was featured in the first film. Scott Tibbs' Documentary Amanda has a brief appearance in the short film Scott Tibbs' Documentary which is available on the Special Edition DVD of Saw II. In the short film she is being harassed by a news reporter who wants information on her experience when she was captured by Jigsaw. In response, Amanda punches the reporter in the face and storms off. Saw: The Video Game Amanda appeared in the video game Saw as the first victim that protagonist David Tapp had to save. Upon being placed in the asylum, she was held in a poison/antidote injection trap to reflect her intravenous drug use habits. Tapp rushes to save her and she proceeds to follow him around the asylum. However, she is soon abducted by Pighead, a minion wearing Jigsaw's robes, to cover up Amanda's identity as Jigsaw's apprentice.\\"IGN: Saw: The Videogame Preview\\". Retrieved 8 January 2009. Dead By Daylight Amanda is a playable character in the 2016 video game, Dead By Daylight, as part of the DLC pack titled \\"The Saw Chapter\\".

Characterization Several of the film crew behind the Saw film series have commented on the extent to which Amanda's character had been written to be one of the most important in the franchise. Marcus Dunstan, writer of Saw IV, Saw V, Saw VI, and Saw 3D stated that \\"Shawnee Smith's character [Amanda] represents a tremendous viable, emotional thread throughout the narratives.\\" Fellow writer of Saw IV, Saw V, Saw VI, and Saw 3D Patrick Melton, further stated that \\"I don't think we could have effectively told the story of Hoffman and John Kramer without including Amanda.\\" Kevin Greutert, the editor of Saw, Saw II, Saw III, and Saw IV, and director of Saw VI and Saw 3D, further stated that \\"[Smith] did a great job, and [Amanda's] such a peculiar aspect of the Jigsaw character, with the fact that he had these tender feelings for this weirdo.\\"'Interview: Saw VI Filmmakers Kevin Greutert, Mark Burg, Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton'. Retrieved 21 February 2010. Speaking about her character, actress Shawnee Smith said that while she was not able to completely identify Amanda Young with that of herself, she was however, able to perceive several of Amanda's characteristics to be admirable nevertheless. Smith stated that: \\"When you first meet [Amanda], she's at the bottom, she can't go any lower and it's the combination of that and having nothing left to lose and finding someone to love and to sacrifice for. Obviously she's tragic, but 95% of her was capable of growing the strength to serve and sacrifice for another human being. Now that's rare and it takes strength, courage, practice, diligence, and a fearlessness to build that.\\"'Shawnee Smith Saw 3 Interview'. Retrieved 23 March 2008. Smith also stated that she attempted to find the human being in Amanda, and tried not to merely turn her into a \\"super killer\\".MTV Movies Blog:\\"Saw Star Shawnee Smith Searching for New Scream Queens\\" Smith remarked of Amanda's relationship with Jigsaw that it was not so much an apprentice relationship, but that she perceived it as \\"a true friendship and a real partnership\\". Through interviews with Shawnee Smith, it was revealed that Amanda's evolution into the killer she was at the end of Saw III was in part due to a horrible childhood. Smith stated on numerous occasions that Amanda was severely abused and neglected when she was a child. This had been confirmed by Saw series writer and co- creator Leigh Whannell, who also commented on Amanda's past in a commentary for Saw III. In the original script of Saw III, dialogue between John and Amanda made references to her past; in a scene she explains to John that \\"When I was a little girl, my father would lock me under the stairs. I was terrified of the dark, and he would leave me in there alone. For hours.\\"Original Saw III Script The scene had explained Amanda's emotional turmoil with the Bathroom Trap. Because of her childhood, Amanda had never properly learned to deal with stress and emotional pain, and thus turned to self-harm as a way of dealing with her problems. While in prison, her abusive tendencies were replaced with heroin use. However, after surviving the \\"Reverse Bear Trap\\", she no longer used heroin and returned to cutting, burning, and other forms of self-injury. Her frail emotional state and somewhat mental instability made her quick to anger, and she would often act purely on impulse or emotion (such as trying to kill Eric Matthews, and her emotionally and physically abusive behaviour towards Lynn Denlon). A scene in Saw III explores Amanda's self-injuring tendencies, and shows her cutting the inside of her thigh. The scene was not in the original script, and instead there was a brief scene in which Amanda is shown squeezing a razor blade (which was later replaced by a scene of Amanda squeezing a leather cutter), only hinting at Amanda self-injuring. Prior to filming, Smith had been reading A Bright Red Scream, a book that explains the reasons one would turn to self-injury. It was Smith who insisted that a self- injury scene be filmed and put into the film, believing it was necessary to show Amanda's tendencies for character depth. Amanda displayed indications of guilt and remorse in her actions, as she had a nightmare of one of her victims in a deleted scene in the director's cut of Saw III. In her dream she was confronted by Adam for what she had done to him, thus further revealing the emotional turmoil that her character exhibited.Saw III Director's Cut Jake Huntley wrote of the complexity of Amanda's character in the Irish Journal of Gothic and Horror Studies. Huntley noted that although Amanda sets herself as notably different from the Jigsaw killer, her attachment toward him and her desire to be like him are central to her character's state of mind. Huntley stated that: Huntley further points out that the biggest dilemma that Amanda's character faced is that she lost her sense of \\"self\\" following her \\"Reverse Bear Trap\\" in the first film. This is characterised by her claim to have been \\"reborn\\", symbolising her neurotic desire to be somebody else other than herself. The viewer is confronted with a character who grapples with trying to understand her own identity as she simultaneously attempts to emulate Jigsaw's characteristics, while also setting herself apart as different from him. It is claimed by Huntley that it was this predicament that caused Amanda's gradual emotional breakdown. Huntley stated that: To add to this, some film critics have interpreted Amanda's character to have suffered from Stockholm syndrome in regards to her complex relationship with John.'Darren Lynn Bousman's Saw 2'. Retrieved 22 March 2008.'Saw 3 Review'. Retrieved 22 March 2008. Symbolic representations=Emulation of Jigsaw's icons After becoming one of John's apprentices, Amanda often took on many of John's iconic symbols. For instance, she often wore a pig mask when capturing her victims. Also, in Saw III, she appeared wearing John's iconic red and black theatrical robe. Huntley analysed this as an attempt by Amanda to be \\"dressed as Jigsaw\\". Huntley further stated that: \\"For Amanda, Jigsaw as signifier can only ever stand in the place of a vexatious and frustrating lack and it is this which locates Amanda in such a conflicted position ‚Äì having given \\"every cell\\" of herself to Jigsaw she is only able to act in an imitative and repetitive way, a second, or understudy, in danger of being only slightly more useful than the Billy doll, waiting both for and against Jigsaw's inevitable and impending death.\\" Inescapable traps Amanda eventually developed her own unique modus operandi, in which the traps she set were inescapable, and would kill the test subjects even when the victims had achieved the goals of their games. While John always refused to acknowledge his traps as murder, Amanda openly admitted that her actions did define her as a murderer. She chose to execute her subjects because she did not believe anyone would change, including herself. Huntley pointed out that Amanda's traps are used as a creative tool of juxtaposition with that of Jigsaw's, to effectively point out what the Jigsaw killer was not. Huntley outlined this, stating that: \\"If Jigsaw's games are encounters with Deleuzian affect, Amanda's games are anti-deleuzian, operating more as encounters with Lacanian notions of the signification of death within the symbolic order and the death drive. This is because Amanda, as a Lacanian subject, becomes caught between her own subjectivity and the object of her desire. In purely cinematic terms, Jigsaw directs his games while Amanda acts in hers... The subject's of Amanda's games, undertaken for Jigsaw, constitute only the throwing away, the discarding... At the most basic level, Amanda does not allow chance or potential to interfere, only ever seeing Jigsaw's games as constitutive of the symbolic order, as an elaborate cover for staging the death of those who lack the survival instinct and thus do not deserve life.\\" Reception A film review of Saw III claimed: \\"I found Amanda the scariest part of the movie, not because Shawnee Smith can match the creepy gravitas of Tobin Bell... but the sheer notion of her transformation. Jigsaw, while not physically powerful has the ability to reproduce his twisted world view in formerly sane people, including the ones he's 'tested.'\\" Don Summer, a writer for Best-Horror-Movies.com, commented that Shawnee Smith did a \\"fantastic job\\" in her recurring role as Jigsaw's \\"trusty sidekick\\", Amanda. A film critic for the website Angel Fire concurred that Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith performed very well in their roles. Particularly commenting on the third film, he went on to claim that \\"while Bell's Jigsaw played a major role in Saw III, most of the film is carried along by Shawnee Smith as Amanda\\" who he believed presented an \\"interesting and intriguing character\\". He also expressed admiration for the manner in which Amanda began as a minor character in the original movie, only to have her character's prominence surely yet gradually increase in the sequels. He claimed that \\"You've gotta love the way her character has been expanded in the series from a victim in the first \\"Saw\\" movie, to a trojan horse in the second film, and to a major player in the third film.\\" Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith were nominated for the Spike Scream Award in the category of \\"Most Vile Villain\\" for their portrayals of John and Amanda respectively in Saw III.'Scream 2007 Awards Coming to Spike TV on 23 October'.

Written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, and directed by Ed Bye, this episode introduced the mechanoid character Kryten. The episode was re-mastered, along with the rest of the first three series, in 1998. Plot Red Dwarf receives a distress call from a crashed spaceship, the Nova 5. When Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie), Dave Lister (Craig Charles), and Cat (Danny John-Jules) check the call, they learn that it was made from a service mechanoid called Kryten (David Ross), who reports that all of the crew are dead except for three female crew members. Eager to rescue them but learning from Holly (Norman Lovett) it will take 24 hours for Red Dwarf to reach the crash site, the group boldly spruce themselves for their meeting. Upon boarding the Nova 5, they quickly discover that the women are also dead and that Kryten has been oblivious to this for centuries. Upon being convinced by the others of this fact, Lister takes pity on Kryten when he questions how he will cope, and decides to bring him back to Red Dwarf.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 52. Once on the ship, Rimmer makes use of him to serve primarily himself, much to Lister's disgust. As a result, Lister tries to make Kryten live for himself by having him watch films starring Marlon Brando and James Dean. Although his plan seems not to work, Rimmer is angered when his request for a portrait by Kryten leads him to painting the hologram in an admiral uniform while using a toilet. Kryten takes heart in Lister's tutoring and rebels by insulting Rimmer and ruining his bunk, before asking to borrow Lister's space bike and speeding off to enjoy himself. Production The writers realised that the huge Red Dwarf ship on its own did not generate enough story material and to accommodate this new direction for the series a small shuttle ship, Blue Midget, was designed to ferry the crew to and from different locations. The new ship was based on an \\"every day car\\" that would go from A to B. Miniature crew models were made to fit inside the small ship and filming was added to footage of the Red Dwarf ship. It took up to eight hours for David Ross to get into the Kryten make- upThis is the first appearance of Kryten, who wasn't originally intended to become a main character and is not seen again in Series 2. David Ross played Kryten in this episode, but because of scheduling clashes Robert Llewellyn played the character when he became a regular from Series III onwards.Series II Episode Guide, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 5, July 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, The writers had resisted using robot characters as they had considered the practice a sci-fi clich√©. Kryten's appearance was of a mechanical-looking butler with an angular head. The head mask had provided the most problems to the make up and effects team. Prosthetic foam originally used for the mask kept falling apart and eventually a latex piece was produced. Initially it had taken David Ross up to eight hours to get into the full Kryten make-up. To make matters worse, Ross suffered from claustrophobia.Interview: David Ross, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 1, March 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, Johanna Hargreaves appeared as the Esperanto teacher and Tony Slattery voiced an android actor in the Androids television show. Cultural references *Howard Goodall wrote the Androids theme tune with the Australian soap opera Neighbours in mind. The song, containing similar lyrics and tune, was trimmed down due to time constraints. *Lister insists that Kryten should watch classic rebel films like The Wild One, Rebel Without a Cause and Easy Rider, hoping that the films, including the Marlon Brando rebel speech, would help the mechanoid break his servile programming. Kryten quotes Marlon Brando in the last line of the episode: Rimmer asks, \\"What are you rebelling against?\\" and Kryten replies in an affected voice, \\"What d'ya got?\\" *During the scene where the Red Dwarf crew meets the skeletons around the table, Rimmer originally says they have \\"less meat on them than a Chicken McNugget!\\". The line has been edited to \\"chicken nugget\\", without the reference to McDonald's. Reception Originally broadcast on the British television channel BBC2 on 6 September 1988 in the 9:00 pm evening slot, the episode gained average viewing ratings, and received a mixed response from viewers. One reviewer stated that \\"the episode would be a brilliant one if Kryten weren't a little too C3PO-ish.\\" The episode also received a mixed response from fans, voting it 22nd in a 1992 Red Dwarf Magazine readers' poll with 1.4% of the votes. This ranked it the lowest of Series 2's episodes.Readers survey results, Red Dwarf Smegazine, p. 27., issue 10, December 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, Remastering The remastering of Series I to III was carried out during the late 1990s.

Capricornus (AKA-57) was launched on 14 August 1943 as Spitfire by Moore Dry Dock Co., Oakland, California, under a Maritime Commission contract, sponsored by Mrs. J. E. Mock, acquired by the Navy on 25 November 1943, placed in partial commission the same day, decommissioned on 29 November 1943, and converted by Willamette Iron and Steel Works, Portland, Oregon, and commissioned in full on 31 May 1944, Commander B. F. McGuckin, USNR, in command. Service history=1944-1948 Capricornus made two voyages to carry cargo between San Pedro, California, and Hilo, Hawaii, from 22 July to 19 August 1944, then sailed by way of Eniwetok and Manus for the invasion of Leyte. Cruising with the Southern Attack Force, she entered the Gulf uneventfully, began landing her cargo in the first landings on 20 October, and worked furiously under enemy air attack to complete unloading and withdraw. Safely underway on 24 October, she withdrew to Hollandia, then sailed to Wakde, where she loaded Army reinforcements. As she steamed north to bring her reinforcements to Leyte, there were several air raid alerts on 13 November, and Capricornus joined in splashing the lone torpedo plane which attacked her group. She returned from Leyte to Manus 19 November to take part in rehearsals for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf. Clearing Manus in TF 79's Attack Group \\"Baker\\" for Lingayen, Capricornus with her group came under desperate enemy air attack at sunset on 8 January 1945, when a kamikaze severely damaged . As scattered individual enemy aircraft continued to attack, Capricornus' guns joined in driving them away. The landings took place on schedule on 9 January, although sporadic attacks by Japanese aircraft and small ships continued. Just before sunrise the next day, Capricornus was straddled by two bombs close aboard, spraying her with shrapnel, but no serious damage was inflicted. Capricornus returned to Leyte Gulf on 13 January and continued to support Philippine operations, landing troops and equipment at San Antonio on 26 January, and servicing landing craft. She sailed out of Leyte Gulf on 27 March, bound for the beaches of Okinawa. In the grey dawn of 1 April 1945, Capricornus arrived at the invasion scene, laden primarily with ammunition. For the next eight days, her men labored to deliver her priority cargo, while manning anti-aircraft guns almost continually as furious Japanese air attacks were hurled at the invasion forces. Night retirements, and days off the beaches were the rule until 9 April, when she cleared for Seattle, Washington, and overhaul. Capricornus sailed from San Francisco on 2 June 1945 with cargo for Eniwetok, Guam, and Espiritu Santo, at which island she heard the word of Japanese surrender. Carrying occupation troops, she stood in to Nagasaki on 23 September, then sailed to Manila and Hong Kong to load Chinese troops for the reoccupation of Northern China. Similar support of the occupation continued until 11 December when she arrived at Seattle. Between 8 February 1946 and 2 November 1947, Capricornus carried cargo on four voyages to the Far East, and on 16 November sailed for Norfolk, Virginia. Here she was placed out of commission in reserve on 30 March 1948. 1950-1970 With the expansion of the fleet dictated by the outbreak of the Korean War, Capricornus was recommissioned on 12 October 1950. Through 1960, she operated from Norfolk in training and exercises in Chesapeake Bay and in the Caribbean, along with five periodic deployments to the Mediterranean for service with the 6th Fleet. Notable in her operations were her rescue and salvage assistance to the burning radar picket on 13 November 1955, followed by the difficult towing of the rescued ship to Brooklyn for repairs. In July 1958, Capricornus supported the landing of Marines in Lebanon which forestalled a serious Middle Eastern eruption. Decommissioning and disposal Capricornus was redesignated LKA-57 on 1 January 1969, and decommissioned on 10 February 1970. Transferred to the custody of the Maritime Administration the ship was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, at James River, Virginia. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1977, she was reported scrapped in Spain on 16 May 1985. Awards Capricornus received four battle stars for World War II service.

In the film, a late-teenager is thrust into adulthood when desperate family circumstances compel him to enter a lucrative yet dangerous cross-country dog race. Despite numerous odds against him, including harsh weather, hostile competitors and uncooperative dogs, he strives to continue forward; getting help from unlikely sources along the way, he is shocked to learn that not only he, but the whole country, is inspired and hopeful to see his own \\"iron will\\" come to fruition at the finish line. Plot In 1917, 17-year-old Will Stoneman (Mackenzie Astin) is a mail-runner for his small South Dakota town and an apprentice carpenter for his father Jack (John Terry), who creates furniture and also runs the family farm. After delivering the town mail one day, Will opens a college letter addressed to him and sees that he was accepted to his desired school. Despite his happiness at being accepted, he hesitates to leave his family responsibilities behind; Jack however encourages Will to attend college and to chase his dreams, and to not let fear stand his way. While returning with Will one day from a lumber run with their sled dogs, Jack drowns in a mushing accident when his sled overturns into a river; he sacrifices his own life to prevent Will, whose team was just ahead and tied to his own sled, from being dragged into the water, too. As the only son, now responsible for his mother Maggie (Penelope Windust) and his family's bill- indebted farm, Will despairs of college but protests when his mother plans to sell their valuable sled dogs. Knowing that his father was thinking of competing in an international dog-sled race with a cash prize that his father knew could save the farm, Will insists on making the attempt. After a month of rigorous physical, mental and spiritual training from Native Indian farm hand Ned Dodd (August Schellenberg), Will travels to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to enter the race. The race's principal sponsor, railroad magnate J.W. Harper (David Ogden Stiers), initially refuses his entry as too late. American news reporter Harry Kingsley (Kevin Spacey) sees the youngster as his opportunity to win headlines and gives Will the extra money he lacks to pay the late fee, which Harper reluctantly accepts rather than be criticized in American newspapers. The rich race sponsors and the highly experienced international mushing champions scoff at the brash boy's apparently silly hopes of being real competition for them. During the race, Will's energy and determination wins the grudging respect of the international mushers and immensely pleases Harper, who never expected Will to last for more than a day in the race. Kingsley writes admiring articles gushing about Will's courage and competitive zeal (nicknaming him \\"Iron Will\\" to bolster his public image as an American hero), but his stories, written by a cynical reporter, languish on back pages while the world focuses on the European War. As Will follows Ned's training advice to \\"run longer, sleep less,\\" start earlier and race persistently for the long hours and many days of the over 500 mile race through subzero blizzards and lonely snow-covered forests, he endures brutal cold, steep mountains, treacherous river passages and various other obstacles. Will becomes increasingly tired and sick, especially after he sacrifices his lead one day to save the life of a Icelandic fellow competitor who was felled in a remote area by the influenza beginning to sweep the world. Upon learning Will's intention to win, Harper becomes understanding of him and refuses to drop him out of the race because he experienced similar things as Will did in the past before his own financial success. One of the race's co-sponsors Angus McTeague (Brian Cox) offers a bribe to a particularly brutal Swedish competitor Borg Guillarson (George Gerdes) to do whatever it takes to force the kid out of the race. The intimidating racer eliminates a number of other mushers by underhanded tactics. He also takes a special malevolent interest in the innocent young man, mocking Will, threatening him and eventually releasing the meanest of his large dogs to attack and attempt to kill Will's lead dog, Gus. Will stands up against this active attempted sabotage by Borg and also realizes that his supposed sponsor Kingsley is just using him as a pawn to justify embellished articles which the veteran reporter hopes will win him front-page status and a promotion from the cold North to his paper's Headquarters. However, when McTeague, who has funded the attempted sabotage of Will's attempts so he can win an immense side bet, repeatedly tries to bribe Will to drop out of the race, Kingsley overhears the final offer, defends Will's honor and throws McTeague out. By standing up for the plucky boy, the jaded reporter suddenly lost some of his cynicism and found himself trying to help Will for purely unselfish reasons. Will accepts the gesture and the two make amends. On the last day of the race, reporter Kingsley becomes genuinely concerned when he sees how serious Will's physical condition is and can barely move. Kingsley urges the battered and exhausted Will to drop out of the race and see a doctor, but Will insists on finishing the race. Will finds himself following Borg on a dangerous shortcut to the finish line. This hazardous frosty course alongside runs a turbulent river, just like the trail that took the life of Will's father. Before this, every time Will confronted a frozen lake or icy riverside trail, he avoided those paths out of fear over what happened to his father. This time, Will remembers his Ned's advice and finds the courage to trust his dog team and risk the water hazards as Gus recovers enough to finish the race. Borg takes the lead by continually whipping his dogs, but they quit from exhaustion and attack him when he attempts to brutalize them into continuing. Will sees Borg being savaged by his team and scares them off, saving his enemy, as he races by on the dangerous shortcut. The large crowd waiting at the finish line suddenly sees Will come into view with a huge lead. Exhausted from lack of sleep, having been battered by falls and cut by tree limbs, Will's sled overturns near the finish line and he collapses. Then Ned awakens the spirit of his father's dog Gus with a familiar whistle with the crowd following suit. While the other racers close in, Will struggles to stand back up again and cross the finish line just ahead of the others. Falling to the ground, unable to stand, he is helped up by his fellow competitors and falls into his mothers arms in an embrace. Spectators, along with Kingsley, Harper and other race officials and reporters, surround Will, applauding him for his heroic victory, his endurance and persistence for not giving up.

Although the race takes place between Winnipeg and Saint Paul, neither city actually appears in the film. The Winnipeg starting point for the race was filmed in Duluth, Minnesota near the Historic Old Central High School. The Lake Superior Railroad Museum, located in Two Harbors, Minnesota, portrayed the St. Paul train station's finish line. Due to the general lack of mountains in Minnesota (excepting the Sawtooth Mountains), scenes in which Will goes through mountainous terrain were filmed in Montana. Additional footage was shot in Superior, Wisconsin as well as Brookston, Minnesota. Box office In its opening weekend, Iron Will took in $5,313,406. The film made a total domestic gross of $21,006,361.  Reception  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 62%, based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 6.13/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \\"A+\\" grade. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times gave it 2 out of 4 and wrote: \\"Iron Will is an Identikit plot, put together out of standard pieces.

Being built in the East of England countryside, the majority of the road is flat, and some of the road is raised.  Route  ;Bedfordshire - Leighton Buzzard to Luton : The road begins at a roundabout with the A418 and the A4146 south of Leighton Buzzard as a wide A-Class Primary Route. The road passes through two roundabouts as a single carriageway, and acts as the Leighton Buzzard Bypass. To enter Leighton Buzzard from the A505, an advisable route is to use the A4012 North from the roundabout at Billington. Southbound on the A4146 from here will take you towards Hemel Hempstead and Whipsnade Zoo. Continue along the A505 along a 50 MPH stretch with speed cameres to reach the A5. The A505 continues in Dunstable. The A5 south allows you to reach Luton and Dunstable. There are speed cameras again on this piece of road. An east turn in Dunstable takes you to Luton on the secondary A class road, A505. The A505 will reach the M1 motorway at Junction 11. Going northbound will take you to Milton Keynes, Northampton, Birmingham and Leeds, whilst Southbound is heading towards London and St Albans. Prior to this is a roundabout with the road number A5065. Taking the A5065 into Luton is a replacement to the A505 which resumes after Luton as a dual carriageway.

This road is the Luton to Hitchin stretch, which leads directly to both. The 2 lane road passes through the English countryside before entering Hitchin. There is a roundabout, which southbound using the A602 takes you to Stevenage. Heading north will keep you on the A505. After passing through a one way system, you will find another roundabout. Heading north takes you onto the A600 heading towards Shefford and Bedford. Heading East will keep you on the A505. This road winds through the eastern suburbs of Hitchin as a single carriageway. The road then enters Letchworth Garden City, though only the outskirts on the south side. Signs are posted in either direction, showing both routes to Hitchin and the A1(M). Heading South at a roundabout in Letchworth will result in arriving at the A1(M). An A road given a motorway standard due to its high speed. The A505 joins this road at Junction 9. ;Hertfordshire - Baldock to Royston (Roman Road Information) : The A505, after the A1(M), becomes a primary route, usually marked green on both atlases and signs. The recent construction of the Baldock bypass has created a dual carriageway from the A1(M) J9 through to Royston. A roundabout allows traffic into Baldock via the B197, as does a junction after the tunnel. The tunnel is a later redevelopment with the Baldock bypass. It travels under one of the Chiltern Hills, under farmland, and is called the Weston Hills Tunnels. This piece of the road is not open to cyclists, farm traffic, motorcyclists under 50cc and has height and width restrictions. The road passes a junction and dips into a large hill on the almost perfectly straight Dual Carriageway. The road follows the railway track. After another roundabout is the Royston Bypass. Here, the road passes through the Greenwich Meridian. The first roundabout is the terminus point of the A1198, a Royston to Huntingdon road which is in a perfect straight line, and serves part of the London - Lincoln Roman Road, Ermine Street. This road was also previously numbered the A14. Ermine Street now joins the A1(M) and the A607 where it enters Lincoln. Unfortunately, the road is not all joined up, and there is very little trace south of Royston. The site of this Roundabout, or near Royston, may have been a junction for Ermine Street and Icknield Way. The previous dual carriageway may also be part of the ancient Icknield Way. If you were to continue along the A505 towards Cambridge, you would still be using the Icknield Way. The road may not just be Roman, with many fossils found along this path. After the Junction with the A1198, is a large cutting to form the A505, then is a roundabout with the A10, with northbound going to Cambridge via the popular Shepreth Wildlife Park and Trumpington Park and Ride. Southbound on the A10 will take you into Royston towards London. The A505 continues northbound, leaves Hertfordshire and enters Cambridgeshire. ;Cambridgeshire - Royston to A11 :The road continues as single carriageway roughly north-easterly, following the ancient Icknield Way past Goffers knoll and passing through the hamlet of Flint Cross and over the Anglo-Saxon earthwork Bran Ditch. It enters the village of Duxford and passes the Imperial War Museum Duxford. The road crosses the M11 at Junction 10 - southbound leading to Bishop's Stortford, Stansted Airport, Harlow and London, but is just signposted for London and Airport. Northbound is signposted to The Midlands with Cambridge and A14. It also leads to Huntingdon and the A10. Icknield Way bears off north to join the A11 whilst the A505 continues forward to Whittlesford, then another roundabout with a service station (BP) and the A1301, northbound to Sawston, The Shelfords and Cambridge, the southbound route goes to Saffron Walden and the Historic Chesterfords where the Icknield Way once ran. Saffron Walden would be signposted from the M11 previously, as there is a restricted Junction at M11 Junction 9. The A505 serves as an access route to the A11 to those from the North, though another alternative would be to use the A14 if coming from the north, to access routes to Thetford and Newmarket. After the Sawston junction, the road continues forward and joins the A11 Northbound ONLY. The left lane is to access Cambridge, Haverhill and Linton on the A1307, and the right lane for A11 routes to Norwich and Thetford and A14 routes EAST to Newmarket, Bury St Edmunds, Ipswich and Felixstowe. After the A1307 to the Six Mile Bottom Junction is part of the Icknield Way continued from the Chesterfords and the A505 before.  Bypasses  For part of its route between Leighton Buzzard and Dunstable (the \\"Leighton Buzzard bypass\\"), the road uses the former route of the Leighton Buzzard to Luton railway, as far as Dunstable. It also shares its route with the A5 near Dunstable and the A1081 near Luton Airport (). The section between Letchworth and Royston follows the Icknield Way, with the deviations of modern bypasses at Baldock and Royston. The ¬£43 million Baldock bypass includes the Weston Hills Tunnel.  Earlier routes  Originally the route started in Dunstable and ended in Luton. The rest of the route was originally designated the A601 to the A11, but was extended west to Wing Hill, near Linslade, when the Leighton Buzzard bypass was built. However, the western Leighton Buzzard bypass has since been built and designated the A4146. As a result, the section from Billington Road to Wing Hill has also been designated the A4146.

Biography Scott was born in Alexandria, Pennsylvania, and was the 4th child of Agnes Irvine and John Scott, Sr., both of Scottish descent. He became a merchant and farmer in Pennsylvania. In 1850 Scott visited Florida and moved to Quincy, Florida in 1851. In 1852, Scott moved to Leon County, Florida, where he established a mercantile exchange and his George W. Scott Plantation. In 1860 Scott enlisted in the Tallahassee Guards, a Leon County militia organization. Upon the formation of the Confederacy he was appointed Captain of Company D, Second Florida Cavalry. Scott organized and was elected lieutenant-colonel of the Fifth Florida Cavalry Battalion in 1863, serving throughout middle and east Florida. Scott's unit, called \\"Scott's Cavalry,\\" participated in the February, 1864 Battle of Olustee and in subsequent actions near Jacksonville. In March 1865 Scott and his men played a prominent role in the Battle of Natural Bridge, south of Tallahassee, which prevented a Union occupation of the State Capital. Scott's unit surrendered and was paroled at Tallahassee in May 1865. In 1868 Scott ran for Florida governor as a Democratic-Conservative and received overwhelming support. However, due to Northern occupation of Florida, Scott was ruled out for the position. He had not wanted to be a candidate and was relieved at the solution. While on his plantation, Scott experimented in a variety of crops and planted of sugar cane, cabbage, collards, rutabagas, Dutch turnips. Scott also created a 16-foot (5 m) overshot waterwheel transferring water from a pond going to corn, sugar and cotton processing. Scott came up with a revolutionary fertilizer which combined cottonseed with bone meal. Bone was obtained by black farm hands who earned a gallon of cane syrup for every 100-pound sack of animal bones. The bones were crushed with a heavy cast-iron stamp powered by a waterwheel and the meal mixed with sulfuric acid. This was then mixed with cottonseed cake to make a final product. In 1870 Scott sold his plantation and moved to Savannah, Georgia, then Atlanta, where he built his business. By 1887, the Gossypium Phospo, made by the George W. Scott Company, had become one of the most noted fertilizers in the south. Tallahassee Weekly Floridian, January 28, 1886 Scott became the first person to exploit Florida's vast phosphate deposits and in 1887 purchased 1,000 acres (4 km2) of land along the Peace River in Charlotte County and also backed the Arcadia Phosphate Company and sells Comer-Hall Fertilizer Company in Savannah. In May 1888 the first shipments of phosphate were made to his G. W. Scott Manufacturing Company. Scott built a fortune in real estate and fertilizer in Atlanta. In 1890 Scott gave $112,250 to Decatur Female Seminary, which he helped organize. The institute took the name of his mother, Agnes Scott, to become Agnes Scott College. He is buried in Decatur Cemetery. Scott is the namesake to the city of Scottdale, Georgia.

The Chase Tower (formerly known as Valley Center and Bank One Center) in Phoenix, Arizona, is the tallest building in the state of Arizona. Built in 1972, it is 483 feet (147 m) tall. It was originally built for local financial heavyweight Valley National Bank, which Bank One merged with in 1993. Bank One merged with Chase in 2005, and the building was renamed in December 2005. It is 40 stories tall, but the highest occupiable floor is the 38th. There is no longer a public observation area on the 39th floor in the Chase Tower; it was closed during redevelopment and construction on the upper floors. The tower takes up an entire city block. The footprint is similar to a 3 leaf clover and its stem. The stem is the narrow elevator core on the southern facade. It has a rough, concrete texture and is the tallest portion of the tower. The remaining exterior is a glass panel curtain wall. The west leaf, or wing, stand at 34 floors followed by the north wing at 38 floors and the east wing at 36 floors. Unlike many traditional skyscrapers with zero- setback retail/lobby space on the ground floor, access to the tower is through an underground restaurant/retail concourse set a comparatively large distance away from the bordering streets. The building under construction in 1972. The building was designed by the prominent Los Angeles architectural firm Welton Becket and Associates (now Ellerbe Becket), with local associate architects Guirey, Srnka, Arnold & Sprinkle. It was built by the Henry C. Beck Company (now The Beck Group). Upon completion, the tower marked the beginning of a renewed investment in downtown Phoenix that would last for almost twenty years until the savings and loan crisis brought about the 1989 real estate crash. Located at 201 North Central Avenue, the tower was renovated in 2003 to accommodate 800 additional Bank One employees. In March 2007, CRZ Phoenix, LLC, an affiliate of Crystal River Capital, acquired the property for $166.9 million, the highest price paid for an office building in Phoenix. The owners took out a $198.5 million loan on the property in 2007, which it subsequently defaulted on. In May 2018, a partnership managed by Wentworth Property Company acquired the building out of foreclosure for $79 million, less than half of its 2007 sale price. Less than six months later, Vincent Viola purchased the building for $107.5 million. The building was featured in the History Channel series Life After People.

Proposed by statesman Mori Arinori in 1873 (six years after the Meiji Restoration) and officially formed on 1 February 1874, the Meirokusha was intended to ‚Äúpromote civilization and enlightenment‚Äù, and to introduce western ethics and the elements of western civilization to Japan. It played a prominent role in introducing and popularizing Western ideas during the early Meiji period, through public lectures and through its journal, the Meiroku zasshi. Mori had been impressed by the activities of American educational societies during his stint (1871-1873) as Japan's first envoy to the United States. He was also influenced by Horace Mann's views on universal education. Its original members were Mori Arinori, Nishimura Shigeki, Fukuzawa Yukichi, Kato Hiroyuki, Mitsukuri Rinsho, Mitsukuri Shuhei, Nakamura Masanao, Nishi Amane, Tsuda Mamichi, and Sugi Koji. The society grew to encompass a total of thirty-three members, including Sakatani Shiroshi, Kanda Takahira, Maejima Hisoka, Nagayo Sensai, Tanaka Fujimaro, Tsuda Sen, ≈åtsuki Fumihiko, and William Elliot Griffis. This membership thus included some of the most leading educators, bureaucrats, and philosophers of 19th century Japan, from a variety of backgrounds. Most had studied both Confucianism and western philosophy, and most had experience in living abroad. The Confucian faction felt that the strength and prosperity of the western nations was built on a foundation of moral strength, and urged that Japan follow the same path. The western philosophy faction asserted that the strength and prosperity of the western nations was due to logic, science, and rationally organized and operated organizations and institutions. The pragmatist faction held that Japan had its own unique and special strengths that needed to join with both western values and western systems of government. One of the main issues they debated was religious freedom and the ideal relationship between religion and the nation state. Although the Meirokusha continued to function up to around 1900, the society's influence sharply declined after it was forced to cease publishing its journal following the introduction of the Press Ordinance and the Libel Law in 1875.

The pretenders to the ducal throne were the two daughters of Duke Rainald II: Machteld, who was married to John II, Count of Blois, and Mary, wife of William II of J√ºlich and mother to William I of Guelders and J√ºlich, on whose behalf she claimed the throne of Guelders. 14th-century Guelders was divided in two factions: * The Heeckerens supported Machteld of Guelders, and were led by Frederik van Heeckeren van der Eze (1320-1386). * The Bronckhorsters supported William of Guelders, and were led by Gijsbert V van Bronckhorst (1328-1356).

They are native to South-east Asia and Australasia and are most often found in open country and scrubland. They feed mainly on seeds which they find by foraging on the ground. They typically lay two eggs in a simple nest of twigs and grass. Their plumage is mostly greyish-brown with a pattern of spots or bars. The zebra dove and diamond dove are commonly kept in captivity. The genus was introduced in 1837 by the English naturalist William John Swainson with the zebra dove (Geopelia striata) as the type species.

La Prensa headquarters is capped by a bronze monument to liberty in 1898 Based in Buenos Aires, it was founded on 18 October 1869 by Jos√© C. Paz. La Prensa ranked among the most widely circulated dailies in Argentina in subsequent decades, earning a reputation for conservatism and support for British interests in Argentina. Following the election of populist leader Juan Per√≥n, La Prensa declined due to both competition from new dailies (notably Clar√≠n), as well a to government pressure. This latter development culminated in the paper's April 1951 seizure by the state, and its sale to the CGT labor union. La Prensa was returned to the Gainza Paz family by the succeeding regime in 1956, though its readership never regained its pre-1951 levels. Ultimately, the company sold its landmark Avenida de Mayo headquarters in 1988 to the city, which converted it into the City Cultural Ministry.

The Braddock Road was a military road built in 1755 in what was then British America and is now the United States. It was the first improved road to cross the barrier of the successive ridgelines of the Appalachian Mountains. It was constructed by troops of Virginia militia and British regulars commanded by General Edward Braddock of the Coldstream Guards, part of an expedition to conquer the Ohio Country from the French at the beginning of the French and Indian War, the North American portion of the Seven Years' War. George Washington was an aide- de-camp to General Braddock (one of his favorites) who accompanied the expedition. The expedition gave him his first field military experience along with other American military officers. A number of these men would profit from this experience during the Revolutionary War. Construction In 1755, Braddock was sent to remove the French from Fort Duquesne (Pittsburgh). Starting from Fort Cumberland, General Braddock ordered 600 men, commanded by Major Chapman and John St. Clair to cut a military road over Haystack Mountain. The road followed an Indian path known as Nemacolin's path which had been improved by George Washington and Christopher Gist for the Ohio Company. Compton's task was to build the road to Little Meadows, about 20 miles away. After a day of road-building, Maj. Chapman's men had only built two miles of road and had destroyed three wagons trying to get over the treacherous terrain encountered on the mountain. Braddock was about to dispatch 300 more men to the road crew when he was informed, by Lt. Spendlowe of the Navy detachment, of an easier route through the Narrows. Braddock took approximately 1400 men, with accompanying wagons, along Spendlow's route and joined Chapman's road at Spendlow's Camp, in today's LaVale, MD Lacock's map of the road Braddock met defeat east of Fort Duquesne and was fatally wounded. He was buried in the middle of the road he built, and his soldiers marched over the grave, with the hope of concealing the grave's location from the Indians. The grave was found years later by road workers and the grave was moved. The site is now marked by a marble monument erected in 1913. The Forbes Expedition, a more successful British expedition mounted against Fort Duquesne in 1758, used a different route through the mountains west of Carlisle, Pennsylvania along what became known as Forbes' Road. The Cumberland Road aka the National Road and later, U.S. Route 40, roughly parallel Braddock's Road between Cumberland, Maryland, and Laurel Ridge near Uniontown. In August 1908 and again during June and July 1909, John Kennedy Lacock, a Harvard professor originally from Amity, near Washington, Pennsylvania, was able to identify the path of Braddock's march. He hired Ernest K. Weller to photograph the road. Lacock's commissioned photographs survive in the form of postcards, which he published in 1910, and his written account was published in the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography in 1914. The road Lacock discovered was a road made by over 30 years of colonial settlers following Braddock's trail.

It is a vacation destination and summer colony area and is heavily dependent on tourism, real estate and fishing. Notable communities on the peninsula include Point Pleasant Beach, Bay Head, Mantoloking, Lavallette, Ortley Beach, Seaside Heights, Seaside Park and the South Seaside Park section of Berkeley Township. The southern of the barrier island are preserved in their natural state as Island Beach State Park, New Jersey's longest stretch of undeveloped coastline.Zarine, Ali; Singh, Andrew; Khandaker, Nazrul I.; Schleifer, Stanley; And Kaur, Manpreet. \\"Sedimentology of Island Beach State Park\\", 2009 Portland GSA Annual Meeting, Geological Society of America. Accessed September 23, 2013. \\"Island Beach State Park, at almost 10 miles in length, is the largest undeveloped stretch of barrier islands on the New Jersey coast, and one of the largest in the United States.\\" Geography The peninsula divides the Atlantic Ocean from Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey. It stretches approximately 20 miles from Manasquan Inlet in Point Pleasant Beach in the north to Island Beach State Park in the south. It is separated from Long Beach Island to the south by the treacherous Barnegat Inlet. The area surrounding the peninsula were described by Henry Hudson, in 1609, as \\"a great lake of water, as we could judge it to be ... The mouth of the lake hath many shoals, and the sea breaketh on them as it is cast out of the mouth of it.\\" The name of the peninsula is derived from that of the adjacent inlet and bay, which were originally named in 1614 \\"Barendegat,\\" or \\"Inlet of the Breakers,\\" by Dutch explorers of the coastline, referring to the waterway's turbulent channel.Lloyd, John Bailey. Eighteen Miles of History on Long Beach Island., p. 42. Down The Shore Publishing and The SandPaper, Inc., 1994. . An analysis of the composition of sediments and sands on the peninsula shows that it has been little-changed for hundreds of years. Communities Communities on the peninsula include Point Pleasant Beach, Bay Head, Mantoloking, Lavallette, Ortley Beach, Normandy Beach, Seaside Heights, and Seaside Park. Additionally, Brick Township Beaches I, II, and III, Dover Beaches North, and Dover Beaches South are located on the peninsula. Point Pleasant Beach is a popular family resort known for its boardwalk, aquarium, and fishing industry. The town is also adjacent to the Manasquan River and Manasquan Inlet. Bay Head is noted for its quiet beaches, the Bay Head Yacht Club and its fine Shingle-style seashore houses. Bay Head was founded in 1886 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Mantoloking, the second-wealthiest community in the state, is known for its Shingle-style houses overlooking the Atlantic Ocean and Barnegat Bay. The Mantoloking Yacht Club has produced Olympic- champions. Normandy Beach, Lavallette, Dover Beaches North (Ocean Beach and Chadwick Beach); Ortley Beach; and Seaside Park are predominantly summer-only coastal towns with extremely small winter populations. They are popular for their fairly affordable housing stock, their ocean beaches and access to water activities on Barnegat Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Seaside Heights is the principal community in the southern half of the peninsula, world-famous for its boardwalk and amusement piers lined with food stands, shops, games-of- chance, and amusement park rides. Seaside Heights has a winter population of 5,000 and a summer population of close to 40,000, swelled by vacationers from New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. In the summers of 1998 and 2002, MTV hosted their summer-broadcast in Seaside Heights. The main thoroughfare connecting these shore towns is Route 35. Connections to the mainland include the Mathis and Tunney Bridges in Toms River connecting Seaside Heights, Route 35 running north from Point Pleasant Beach to Manasquan over the Manasquan River, Bridge Avenue between Point Pleasant and Bay Head, and the Mantoloking Bridge linking Mantoloking with Brick Township. Since the Point Pleasant Canal was built in 1925 connecting the Manasquan Inlet with the Barnegat Bay, the peninsula is technically an island.Cheslow, Jerry. \\"If You're Thinking of Living In/Point Pleasant, N.J.; A Borough With a Variety of Boating\\", The New York Times, November 9, 2003. Accessed September 23, 2013. \\"Completed in 1925, the two-mile-long canal is at the northern terminus of the inland portion of the Intracoastal Waterway, which meanders through bays and rivers all the way to southern Florida. Rusting steel bulkheads line the sides of the canal to prevent the banks from eroding and stopping up the channel, a link between the Manasquan River, which feeds into the Atlantic, and Barnegat Bay on Point Pleasant's southern line.\\" It is sometimes referred to as Barnegat Beach Island, or more commonly, \\"the barrier island.\\" Effects of Hurricane Sandy On October 29, 2012, an inlet opened between Barnegat Bay and the Atlantic Ocean at the bay's north end, when Hurricane Sandy wiped out a section of the peninsula at the base of the Route 528 bridge in Mantoloking. Much of that borough was destroyed along with the east end of the bridge. The bridge as well as the entire stretch of Route 35 up and down the peninsula have since reopened .

The episode was written by Dennis Lehane from a story by David Simon & Dennis Lehane and was directed by Rob Bailey. It originally aired on October 3, 2004. Synopsis At the weekly ComStat meeting, Burrell demotes Major Marvin Taylor for failing to bring down crime figures in his district. Carcetti submits to an interview in which he blames high crime rates on Mayor Royce's failure to fund police training. Burrell is outraged that Carcetti has gone to the press, and is forced by the mayor to take the hit over the story. He later meets with Royce, Parker, Watkins and State's Attorney Steven Demper to discuss the murder rate. Watkins urges Royce to fire Burrell, but the mayor decides to continue backing the acting commissioner as a reward for his political loyalty. After attending a fundraiser with his wife and children, Carcetti has sex with a woman he noticed in the crowd. As Omar's crew scope out a Barksdale stash house, Kimmy questions Omar's vendetta against the Barksdale Organization. Their robbery the next day goes awry when the Barksdales open fire on the crew, causing Dante to accidentally kill Tosha. Kimmy shoots Tank before the crew make their escape. Bell is called to meet Proposition Joe, who says that the Major Case Unit tipped their hand by bringing in Cheese and telling him about the wiretap. Stringer orders his enforcers to cover Tosha's funeral and wake in case Omar shows up. Omar takes responsibility for Tosha's death and watches Bell's funeral home from across the street as they hold Tosha's memorial services. Donette repeatedly tries to contact Bell without success. McNulty goes to Bunk for his opinion on D'Angelo's death. Bunk has been tasked with recovering Dozerman's stolen weapon, and accompanies Holley to go to the scene of the botched robbery. There, he notices children nearby pretending to be Omar and acting out the shooting. Daniels convenes a meeting to discuss shifting the MCU's focus from Bell and Joe to a new target, to Greggs' vocal displeasure. McNulty is angered by both the unit's change in direction and Pearlman's new relationship with Daniels. McNulty and Greggs cruise the Western to see what has changed since the towers fell instead of focusing on Daniels' target. While observing Fruit's crew the next day, McNulty learns that Ray Cole has died while exercising at the gym. He and the other detectives go to the bar to attend Cole's cop wake, where Landsman delivers the eulogy. Colvin and a reluctant Mello survey quiet territory in their district to push drug activity into. Colvin orders his men to stop reclassifying crimes and give the statistics straight. At the next ComStat meeting, Burrell and Rawls berate Colvin for a minuscule rise in his district's figures, and threaten to remove him from his post if they do not improve. As the commanders discuss their plans to meet Rawls' demands, Colvin says that he is considering legalizing drugs; the other commanders laugh, assuming that Colvin is joking. Later, Colvin informs his men that he plans to move drug trade into three specific areas. McNulty and Greggs track down Bubbles and Johnny to offer them work. Bubbles takes the offer, saying that he is always willing to go for easy money. Marlo orders Fruit to help him invade Barksdale territory, leading Fruit and his team to assault Bodie's crew. Cutty tracks down his former girlfriend Grace Sampson, who is now a middle school teacher. Grace seems impressed that Cutty is out of the game, but gently rebuffs his attempt to rekindle their past relationship.

It has been represented by Fred Keller since May 21, 2019, who won a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of former representative Tom Marino. Prior to 2018, the 12th district was located in southwestern Pennsylvania, and included all of Beaver County, and parts of Allegheny, Cambria, Lawrence, Somerset, and Westmoreland Counties. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew this and other state congressional districts in February 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional due to partisan gerrymandering. The new 12th district covers much of the old 10th district. The old 12th district was redrawn to an area north and west of Pittsburgh and renamed the 17th district, for the 2018 elections and representation thereafter. Before the 2011 round of redistricting, the 12th District was widely considered to be gerrymandered by the Republican-controlled state legislature as a heavily Democratic district. It consisted of all of Greene County, and parts of Allegheny, Armstrong, Cambria, Fayette, Indiana, Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland Counties. Geography 2003‚Äì2013 Located in southwestern Pennsylvania, the 12th District consisted of all of Greene County, and parts of Allegheny, Armstrong, Cambria, Fayette, Indiana, Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland Counties. A thoroughly unionized district, the 12th was historically among the most Democratic areas of the state. However, the Democrats in this area were not as liberal as their counterparts in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Most were somewhat conservative on social issues, particularly abortion and gun control. The 12th included all of Greene County, a highly rural region that still has a traditionally Democratic influence due to its labor leanings. In Washington county, the city of Washington, a large and Democratic edge suburb of Pittsburgh was a part of the 12th, as well as the eastern portion of the county. Most of the Monongahela Valley region, a very Democratic area that was once an important steel-making area, was also part of the 12th. However, more rural western Washington County and the suburban northern portion of the county (with towns like McDonald and Canonsburg) then belonged to the 18th. The western portion of Fayette County, including the city of Uniontown, a labor Democratic stronghold was part of this district, while the rural mountainous eastern portion was a part of the 9th. The 12th District continued eastward, including southeastern and northeastern parts of Westmoreland County, including the labor Democratic city of Latrobe, while leaving the suburban western part of the county (with towns such as Murrysville) and the generally left-leaning city of Greensburg in the 18th. The major population base of the district was located just to the east, taking in most of Somerset and Cambria counties. This area, the heart of a large coal-mining region, includes the district's largest city, Johnstown. The 12th also contained a part of Indiana County, mainly the college town of Indiana. The 12th completed its wrap around the metro Pittsburgh region by ending in the northeastern corner of the city's suburbs, containing middle class regions such as Lower Burrell and the working class suburb of New Kensington. A portion of Armstrong County was also included in the district, including several industrial suburbs such as Freeport and Apollo. DemographicsHistory After the 2000 census, the Republican-controlled state legislature radically altered the 12th in an effort to get more Republicans elected from traditionally heavily Democratic southwestern Pennsylvania. A large chunk of the old 20th District was incorporated into the 12th. In some parts of the western portion of the district, one side of the street is in the 12th while the other side of the street is in the 18th District (the reconfigured 20th). This led to criticism that the 12th was a gerrymander intended to pack as many of southwestern Pennsylvania's heavily Democratic areas as possible into just two districts‚Äîthe 12th and the Pittsburgh-based . Prior to the 2012 redistricting, the district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index score of R+1. The district is notable as the only congressional district in the nation that voted for Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004 but went for Republican John McCain in 2008. This is mainly due to the fact that since 2000 Southwestern Pennsylvania has gradually become more Republican leaning. 2006 election In the 2006 election, Murtha was re-elected with 61% of the vote. His Republican opponent, Washington County Commissioner Diana Irey, received 39%. 2008 election John Murtha won the 2008 election with 58% of the vote. Murtha was a United States Marine and the first Vietnam War veteran to serve in Congress. He defeated Lt. Col. William T. Russell, an army veteran. 2010 special election Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell scheduled a special election for May 18, 2010, following the death of Representative John Murtha. On March 8, 2010, the Pennsylvania Democratic Party's Executive Committee nominated Mark Critz, Murtha's former district director. On March 11, a convention of Republicans from the 12th district nominated businessman Tim Burns. The Libertarian Party's candidate was Demo Agoris, who ran for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in the 48th district as a Libertarian in 2006. Mark Critz won the election. 2010 election Mark Critz was re-elected in the regularly scheduled 2010 election; again beating Republican Tim Burns (this time with 51% of the vote against 49%). 2012 election Mark Critz ran for re-election to a second full term in the 2012 election, but was defeated by Republican challenger Keith Rothfus. Critz garnered 48.5% of the vote to Rothfus' 51.5%. The 12th had absorbed a large chunk of the old 4th District, including Rothfus' home, after the 2010 census, and was significantly more Republican than its predecessor. 2019 special election After Tom Marino's resignation in January 2019, an election was held on May 21st to fill the open seat. Republican Fred Keller defeated 2018 Democratic nominee Mark Friedenberg.  List of members representing the district  { class=wikitable style=\\"text- align:center\\" - valign=bottom !

Sydney Camm was the chief designer that introduced what became the typical structure for all Hawker aircraft until the introduction of the jet-powered Hawker P.1040. This structure consisted of metal tubes (steel or aluminium) with their ends swaged so that they could be connected to each other by means of \\"fishplates\\" and bolts (sometimes with ferrules to protect the tubes). Design The design was produced in 1924 as a private venture version of the Hawker Woodcock fighter with the wooden structure of the Woodcock replaced by a mainly metal structure, but as the design developed, the use of a metal structure resulted in an entirely new aircraft. The Heron was a single bay biplane with a metal structure as described above and fabric covered. It was powered by a 455 hp (339 kW) Bristol Jupiter VI engine driving a two-bladed wooden propeller. (A metal propeller was also flown but showed no improvement of performance). There was provision for two .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns. The Air Ministry issued Specification 25/24 to Hawker for a single-seat high-speed fighter landplane and a prototype was ordered for evaluation. The first flight of the prototype, serial number J6989, flown by P.S.W. Bulman was made in 1925. Despite being heavier than the similar powered Woodcock, it was faster and was praised by the pilots that flew it for its excellent handling properties. Due to little interest from the Air Ministry, only one aircraft was built and it was returned to Hawker after testing.

The only airborne radio equipment required for radar approaches is a functioning radio transmitter and receiver. The radar controller vectors the aircraft to align it with the runway centerline. The controller continues the vectors to keep the aircraft on course until the pilot can complete the approach and landing by visual reference to the surface. There are two types of radar approaches: Precision (PAR) and Surveillance (ASR). A radar approach may be given to any aircraft upon request and may be offered to pilots of aircraft in distress or to expedite traffic; however, an ASR might not be approved unless there is an ATC operational requirement, or in an unusual situation or emergency. Acceptance of a PAR or ASR by a pilot does not waive the prescribed weather minimums for the airport or for the particular aircraft operator concerned. The decision to make a radar approach when the reported weather is below the established minimums rests with the pilot. PAR and ASR minimums are published on separate pages in the FAA's terminal procedures publication. Precision approach (PAR) This is one in which a controller provides highly accurate navigational guidance in azimuth and elevation to a pilot. Pilots are given headings to fly, to direct them to, and keep their aircraft aligned with the extended centerline of the landing runway. They are told to anticipate glidepath interception approximately 10‚Äì30 seconds before it occurs and when to start descent. The published decision height will be given only if the pilot requests it. If the aircraft is observed to deviate above or below the glidepath, the pilot is given the relative amount of deviation by use of terms ‚Äúslightly‚Äù or ‚Äúwell‚Äù and is expected to adjust the aircraft rate of descent/ascent to return to the glidepath. Trend information is also issued with respect to the elevation of the aircraft and may be modified by the terms ‚Äúrapidly‚Äù and ‚Äúslowly‚Äù (e.g., ‚Äúwell above glidepath, coming down rapidly‚Äù). Range from touchdown is given at least once each mile. If an aircraft is observed by the controller to proceed outside of specified safety zone limits in azimuth and/or elevation and continue to operate outside these prescribed limits, the pilot will be directed to execute a missed approach or to fly a specified course unless the pilot has the runway environment (runway, approach lights, etc.) in sight. Navigational guidance in azimuth and elevation is provided to the pilot until the aircraft reaches the published decision height. Advisory course and glidepath information is furnished by the controller until the aircraft passes over the landing threshold, at which point the pilot is advised of any deviation from the runway centerline. Radar service is automatically terminated upon completion of the approach. Surveillance approach This is one in which a controller, in ASR, provides navigational guidance in azimuth only. The pilot is furnished headings to fly to align the aircraft with the extended centerline of the landing runway. Since the radar information used for surveillance approach is considerably less precise than that used for a precision approach, the accuracy of the approach will not be as great and higher minimums will apply. Guidance in elevation is not possible but the pilot will be advised when to commence descent to the minimum descent altitude (MDA) or, if appropriate, to an intermediate stepdown fix Minimum Crossing Altitude (MCA) and subsequently to the prescribed MDA. In addition, the pilot will be advised of the location of the MAPt prescribed for the procedure and the aircraft position each mile on final from the runway, airport, heliport, or MAPt, as appropriate. If requested by the pilot, recommended altitudes will be issued at each mile, based on the descent gradient established for the procedure, down to the last mile that is at or above the MDA. Normally, navigational guidance will be provided until the aircraft reaches the MAPt. Controllers will terminate guidance and instruct the pilot to execute a missed approach unless at the MAPt the pilot has the runway, airport, or heliport in sight or, for a helicopter point-in-space approach, the prescribed visual reference with the surface is established. Also, if, at any time during the approach the controller considers that safe guidance for the remainder of the approach cannot be provided, the controller will terminate guidance and instruct the pilot to execute a missed approach. Similarly, guidance termination and missed approach will be effected upon pilot request and, for civil aircraft only, controllers may terminate guidance when the pilot reports the runway, airport, heliport or visual surface route (point-in-space approach) in sight or otherwise indicates continued guidance is not required. Radar service is automatically terminated at the completion of a radar approach. Pilots should check radar services at the airport they desire to land in order to determine if radar approaches are available. Radar approaches are used a lot by many navy/marine corps pilots as a default to emergencies, thus many navy/marine pilots are proficient in Radar approaches.

The excavations in the area began after two archaeologists from the National Historical Museum met a local woman with an exquisite golden necklace found by her husband while ploughing with his tractor. The couple was unaware of the origins of the jewel and cooperated with the archaeologists. The whole treasure consists of 15,000 golden elements. The most important of them was a dagger made of gold and platinum with an unusual edge. The treasure was dated to 2000 B.C. The scientists suggest that the Karlovo valley where Dabene is located used to be a major crafts center which exported golden jewelry all over Europe. That conclusion was made because the golden elements were not discovered in a burial mound and there are no remains of bones or ceramics and therefore the elements were not burial gifts.

Origination of the \\"Sting\\" moniker The domain name 'sting.com' was registered to Michael Urvan on July 25, 1995, as an email domain, for the purpose of supporting his gaming, and later for the gaming clan '{LAVA}' globally ranked on TheCLQ.com. Urvan used the moniker '=Sting=' for playing in online games and competitive matches. Urvan originally used the name Stingray as an alias while BBSing in the mid 1980s, borrowed from a 1985 TV series of the same name. While chatting, people tended to abbreviate the name 'Stingray' and only type 'Sting'. It is because of this habit, that during the early 1990s he began using the moniker 'Sting' for pre-WWW Internet MUD games and BBS signons as illustrated in the ICANN Domain Name Dispute response text. Urvan continued to use this moniker throughout the 1990s but has since changed his gaming moniker, post dispute. The UDRP Domain Name Dispute Attorneys for Gordon Sumner, who uses the stage name \\"Sting\\", filed a complaint against Urvan on July 13, 2000, for the domain name 'sting.com' via the ICANN Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy and the case was sent before World Intellectual Property Organization for arbitration. On July 11, 2000, Dr. Andrew F. Christie was appointed to be the sole panelist by WIPO for the case. On July 19, 2000, after reviewing the complaint submitted by attorneys on the behalf of Sumner, and after reviewing the response provided by Urvan, the case was decided in favor of Urvan. The panel's decision was made based on several factors: that the primary word ('sting') to make up the domain name was a common dictionary word, and that Urvan was using the name in good faith. \\"Urvan's lawyers argued that sting is a common English word, Sumner had not registered it as a trademark and Urvan was legitimately using it, not holding it to ransom. The WIPO panel agreed.\\" The case drew international attention for being the first major defeat of a celebrity in a domain name dispute. The domain name is now used to host Sumner and his band.

In historical records, the village was first mentioned in 1266 as Ecclesia Sancti Egidii. Until the 16th century, it belonged to the Sitno Castle, which together with its possessions belonged to the Balassa family as of 1548 and which passed to the Koh√°ry family in 1629. History=Middle Ages 1266 is a crucial year for Ilija as it appears in written monuments. In the specialist literature, the year 1254 is connected with the Saint Giles Church. The Saint Giles Church played an important role while, in its vicinity, a settlement was organizing. The Medieval settlement borrowed its name from the church's patron saint. Until 1526, Ilija is found in the written sources in its Latin form (Sanctus Egidius), Hungarized (Scenthegud, Zenth Egyed), mixed Hungarian-Slovakian (Zenthlyen in 1496), but also in German as Gilg and Gilgen. Little is known about the development of Ilija in the period between the changes performed in the Saint Giles Church in 1266 and the second decade of the 14th century. That region belonged to the member of the Hunt-Poznanovcov family and its branches. Before 1318, Ilija was in the possession of a branch of the Cs√°ky family from Pl√°≈°≈•ovce. The name of its village is recorded as Scenthegud. In 1347 the Hungarian King, Louis the Great decided that some estates, among them, Ilija (Zentheged) owned by √ñlvengovi, shall be received by ≈†ari≈°sk√Ω Komes Konya. The information on Ilija in further periods depends on how well the historical sources are preserved. And, after some time gap, those date back to 15th century. Renaissance However the sources state one important fact in the proprietary relations and determine the Ilija appurtenance till 16th century. In that period, Ilija is a part of the estate latifundium Litava. The preserved sources about Ilija as a part of the latifundium Litava ‚Äì ƒåabraƒè are from the second half of the 15th century. The members of the Horvatovcov family from Selce owned the town for relatively longer time, since the 1360s. The year 1476 was decisive for the conflict over the boundaries of the Dami√°n Horv√°t‚Äôs estate as the Budyn chapter issued the declaration about the approved distribution of property of the dominium ƒåabraƒè, which, without doubt, is a valuable historical source both for Ilija as for last villages belonging to the latifundium. By the division of Ilija between the widow Frusinova and the brother-in-law, Peter Horvat, there were 8 inhabited farms in the village. This data is one of the first information on real residents of Ilija in the Middle Ages. In 1500, Anton Nyerges fulfills the function of the alderman of Ilija. By the end of the 15th century, the proprietary relations of the dominium ƒåabraƒè were changed what was accompanied by the property disputes. Since there was no transparency in the proprietary relations and disputes were going on, the royal court was entrusted with the care of the castle. About 1511, the castle with the villages, including Ilija, formed a part of the Archbishop Tom√°≈° B√°kociho‚Äôs estate. After his death, in 1517 King Louis II of Hungary decided that the rule would pass to the estate of the family Erd√∂dyovcov. In 1540, Ilija was a feudal property where 5 inhabited and one deserted peasant settlements were registered. There were 3 settlements connected with each other, so called ‚Äûpatvarcz‚Äú, and a mill with one wheel. At the end of November 1566, the Turks reached Ilija and Sitnianska. They set afire houses in Ilija. In 1570, Ilija belonged to the N√≥gr√°d Sand≈æak. The terror imbued by the Turks lasted for almost 150 years with varying intensity. The community of medieval Ilija was engaged in farming, clearing the trees, making the charcoal. The population had to perform labor services towards the castle Litav (ƒåabraƒè) and later towards Sitno. The village was ruled by the elected alderman and alders (seniores). The traditional crafts performed in Ilija were miller‚Äôs trade, smithery and butcher‚Äôs trade. In 1599, the municipality of Ilija belonged to the castle Sitno, which was called as the authorities‚Äô seat and a part of the defense system against the Turks and the Chetniks. The oldest preserved inventory of Manor Estates of Sitnianskeho a ƒåabraƒèsk√©ho dominium prepared by the emperor‚Äôs estate commissars comes from the year 1602. According to that inventory, there were 9 inhabited peasant settlements in Ilija. The Age of Reason The 17th century is important for Ilija due to the relevant changes occurred in the proprietary relations in the estates of both dominions. Those changes were taking place practically till the end of the feudal period under Hungarian conditions and finished with the Revolution 1848/1849; they marked for more than two centuries the development of Ilija and its fortune was united with that of the family Koh√°riovcov till the second half of the 1820s when its successors, the Koburgovcov, died out. In the 17th and at the beginning of the 18th century, those regions became the scene of the state anti-Habsburg insurrections, which alternated with attacks of the Turks and the Mortalovcov who very often were in a conspiracy with the insurgents. In the 18th century, Ilija was, according to the works performed by its residents, a village with developed farming, timber manufacture and home craft. The insurrection of the community against the landlords the Kohariovcov was engendered in the period of Hungarian Urban reforms realized by the reigning Maria Theresa of Austria (1740‚Äì1780). According to the notes of the inventory in 1743, there were living in Ilija 93 persons who were subject to tax, amongst them 55 were members of the lords‚Äô of the Manor families and 38 of the families without a manor house. It is here where the name of the village is established in Slovakian (Swaty Illik).

The first mention of Sv√§t√Ω Anton in written sources dates to 1266, when the village was owned by the Hont-P√°zm√°ny family of the ƒåabraƒè Castle. The last private owner was Ferdinand I of Bulgaria. Landmarks=The manor house in Sv√§t√Ω Anton The manor house was originally built in baroque style as a two-wing building with arcades surrounding an open courtyard with a baroque stone fountain. In the middle of 18th century, Earl Andrej Kohary completed the process of re-building the manor house into a wealthy four-wing noble residence. The Kohary and Coburg families made an essential contribution in the history of the manor house. Here, they concentrated beautiful pieces of artwork and crafts from various parts of the world (18th ‚Äì 20th centuries). The manor house has served the purpose of a museum since 1962; currently it is a museum of art, history and hunting. Park A park that melts into a forest is part of the manor house estate. Currently, remnants of regular baroque type of treatment can be seen on the terraces near the main building. They loosely melt into landscape park and forested park. The preserved water system of the park is supplied with water from the Kolpassky brook through some kilometres long water gang with aqueducts. Until 1995, the meadow in front of the cage was dominated by an almost 120 years old Giant Sequoya (Sequoiadendron giganteum). Phillip Coburg planted it there in 1878 when his only son Leopold was born. In spite of many attempts to save it, the Sequoya dried. A new and healthy tree was then planted at the entrance to the park in 1996. Sv√§t√Ω Anton Pustovn√≠k church The church was originally built in late baroque style in 1754 ‚Äì 1755. In the middle of the 19th century it was rebuilt and got its current classicist aspect. The most valuable masterpieces housed in the church are a Madonna sculpture and a monumental panel painting signed by master M.S. dating from 1506.

Comdr. Walter W. Williamson in command. Service history=1944-1945 Following shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, Muliphen sailed on 1 December 1944 to operate with the Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida. On 14 December, she steamed for the Pacific where she joined Transport Division 43 off Pearl Harbor, and sailed to prepare for the invasion of Iwo Jima at Eniwetok, arriving on 5 February 1945. Muliphen arrived off Iwo Jima on 19 February, unloaded until 4 March, then retired to Saipan. She departed on 27 March for the invasion of Okinawa, took part in a feint landing on 1 April, and repeated the feint the following day. Held in reserve off Okinawa until 10 April, she sailed then for Saipan and cargo duty between the Marianas and Solomons. She arrived Manila on 18 September with a cargo of underwater demolition gear, and spent the next three months carrying occupation troops to Japan from the Philippines, until sailing for Seattle on 24 November. 1946-1970 Serving with the Naval Transportation Service, for the next four years she carried men and supplies to Asiatic and Pacific ports, and supplied Point Barrow, Alaska in 1946 and 1947. In 1950 Muliphen transferred to the Atlantic Fleet Amphibious Amphibious Force, based at Norfolk. The following decade she rotated in a steady schedule of Caribbean and Mediterranean deployments. In 1958 she participated in the amphibious landings at Beirut, Lebanon, when a prompt response by the 6th Fleet prevented Communist subversion of Lebanon's government. Continuing similar duty in the 1960s, she also took part in NATO exercises and the training of Naval Academy midshipmen. On 1 January 1969, Muliphen was redesignated LKA-61.

A clinical thyroidologist is a board certified endocrinologist, who cares for a majority of thyroid patients, with few patients experiencing other endocrine conditions. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) developed the ENDOCRINE CERTIFICATION IN NECK ULTRASOUND (ECNU) program. ECNU is a professional certification in the field of neck ultrasonography for Endocrinologists, Thyroidologists, and Thyroidology practices. Those certified in the field perform consultations and diagnostic evaluations for thyroid and parathyroid disorders through both diagnostic ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (UGFNA). ECNU is seen as a distinguished certification, which increases public and patient confidence in thyroid ultrasound practice. These clinical thyroidologists also take on the role of interventional thyroid radiologists, and specialize in non-surgical procedures such as ablation therapy for thyroid and parathyroid cysts and recurrent neck thyroid cancer lymph nodes. This is also known as Ethanol ablation EA, or PEI.

A lock convoy occurs when multiple threads of equal priority contend repeatedly for the same lock. Unlike deadlock and livelock situations, the threads in a lock convoy do progress; however, each time a thread attempts to acquire the lock and fails, it relinquishes the remainder of its scheduling quantum and forces a context switch. The overhead of repeated context switches and underutilization of scheduling quanta degrade overall performance. Lock convoys often occur when concurrency control primitives such as locks serialize access to a commonly used resource, such as a memory heap or a thread pool.

A \\"cantata with radiophonic and theatrical overtones\\" , it is described by the composer as \\"practically an opera of Mother Earth surrounded by her chicks\\" . It was Stockhausen's first piece composed on principles of modular transposability, and his first musical form to be determined from categories of sensation or perception rather than by numerical units of musical terminology, which marks a significant change in the composer's musical approach from the abstract forms of the 1950s . History Siculiana, in Sicily, where the first version of Momente was begun Stockhausen began work on Momente in January 1962, with a performance planned for the following May. He had been invited by Baron Francesco Agnello to withdraw for the period of composition of the work to his palazzo in Siculiana on the south coast of Sicily. Agnello was an ardent supporter of modern music, and directed the Settimane Internazionali di Nuova Musica di Palermo. The plan was that Stockhausen would go to Sicily first, and Mary Bauermeister would follow a week later, to work on paintings for an exhibition planned for Amsterdam in June. Stockhausen's wife Doris would join them in March, leaving their children in someone's care in Cologne. The palazzo was freezing cold, as it was really intended only as a summer residence, and for three months both Stockhausen and Bauermeister \\"worked like crazy\\" on their respective projects, retreating to a small, easily heated room, furnished with a piano and two tables . Shortly before Doris was to have come to Siculiana a telegram arrived, saying she had been taken seriously ill and required surgery. Stockhausen decided to return to Germany to support her, and they spent a quiet time in the Black Forest, where Doris went to recuperate . A first version of Momente, consisting of all the K moments, i(m), i(d), M(m) and MK(d), was premiered on 21 May 1962 at the Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Cologne. Moment i had already been composed, but was not included in the Cologne performance. A second group of moments, including all the remaining M moments and some of the D moments, was composed for a performance planned for the 1963 Settimane Internazionali di Nuova Musica di Palermo, but the musicians rebelled at the unconventional nature of the music and the performance did not take place. Early in 1964 these moments were revised. Seven of the M moments and the i moment were added for a tour in October 1965, but the D moments were withheld for practical performance reasons (; ; ). Some of the D moments were subsequently reworked, and the long i(k) moment composed for a completely new version, completed in 1969 but only premiered on 8 December 1972 in Bonn. This version was recorded for commercial release and taken on a tour of Europe . Texts Stockhausen draws on a variety of sources for the texts of Momente (; ; ): * Primarily in the D moments, the Song of Songs, in the translation by Martin Luther. Many of the M Moments use shorter extracts from this source. * Extracts from a letter from Mary Bauermeister, mainly in moment I(k), where they are used with passages from the Song of Songs. * Brief quotations from The Sexual Life of Savages by Bronislaw Malinowski, an anthropological report of the Trobriand Islands in British New Guinea, found, for example, in moment M(d). * A quotation from William Blake: \\"He who kisses the joy as it flies/Lives in Eternity's sunrise\\", found in moment M(d) and, in the 1972 and 1998 versions, as an insert from M(d) in M. * Names from fairy tales, e.g., Rapuntzel (MK); invented names, e.g., Kama, Maka, Dodi; cries and exclamations heard from audiences at performances of Stockhausen's earlier works, e.g., \\"bravo\\", \\"pfui\\", \\"nein, das ist unm√∂glich\\", \\"da capo\\", \\"stop it!\\", \\"furchtlos weiter\\", \\"sortez\\", \\"bald?\\". \\"so?\\", \\"schon?\\", \\"jetzt?\\", \\"ja!\\", \\"nein\\", \\"awful!\\", \\"doch!\\", \\"immer\\", \\"wann?\\", \\"warum?\\", \\"wie?\\", \\"wo?\\", \\"sure?\\", \\"wozu?\\". * Invented onomatopoeic words, and phonetic texts written by Stockhausen himself. The main compositional problem was to mediate among all these text fragments, in order to avoid the effect of mere collage . Timbres Momente seeks to employ the greatest possible number of vocal phenomena‚Äînot just conventional singing but also the communication functions of spoken and whispered language, crying, and laughter, producing an \\"infinitely rich mode of expression ‚Ä¶ [that] profoundly touches our emotive sensibility\\" . Isolated syllables and even single phonemes or linguistic segments, including vowels, continuant consonants, and tongue clicks are used \\"in a scale extending from unvoiced exhaling via aspiration, whispering, giggling, murmuring, speaking, shouting, screaming and laughing, to singing\\" in order to \\"permit the composition of timbral transitions and relations between spoken and instrumental sounds\\" . In addition to singing, the choir members clap their hands, snap their fingers, stamp and shuffle their feet, and slap their thighs. They also play small \\"auxiliary\\" instruments: choir I has cardboard tubes of various lengths with glued-on covers, played like drums using light mallets; choir II uses twelve pairs of claves‚Äîall with different pitches; choir III shakes plastic soap boxes and refrigerator drink canisters filled with buckshot, which sound like maracas with different pitches, according to the number of pellets and the size of the plastic canisters or boxes; choir IV uses twelve pairs of Volkswagen lug-nut spanners (which kept disappearing during rehearsals, because most of the choristers drove Volkswagens). The purpose of these instruments was to create mediating links between the percussion and vocal timbres. Having the choristers play simultaneously with each syllable they sing or speak automatically and easily solves the problem of rhythmic coordination . However, Stockhausen reported that the WDR choir, which sang for the premi√®re, initially objected to these practices and, \\"because such means of sound and noise production can have a comic effect, . . . one newspaper report talked about a 'cabaret performance' and ridiculed the whole thing\\" . Form Momente exemplifies what Stockhausen calls moment form, in which the listener's attention is on the \\"now\\", on the \\"eternity that does not begin at the end of time but is attainable in every moment\\" . At the same time, it constitutes a \\"polyvalent form\\", in that its 30 sections (also called \\"moments\\") can be arranged in many different sequences. There are three main groups of moments, designated by letters: eight M, seven K, and eleven D moments. The letters stand for Melodie (melody), Klang (sound, or chord), and Dauer (duration), and also have an autobiographical significance, with K for \\"Karlheinz\\" and the other two letters for Stockhausen's first and second wives, \\"Doris\\" and \\"Mary\\" . The M group emphasizes *monophony/heterophony *\\"random\\" rhythms *mixed pitches and noises *scoring mainly for the brass and solo soprano *an average medium dynamic level The K moments concentrate on *vertical, homophonic textures *periodic rhythms *a predominance of noises *a scoring mainly for the men's voices and percussion *a generally loud dynamic The D moments have *a \\"diagonal\\", or polyphonic character *syncopated rhythms *pitches but little noise *scoring primarily for the electric organs and women's voices *an average soft dynamic. The K group always stands at the centre, with either the D moments preceding and the M moments following (as in the 1972 and 1998 performing versions), or the reverse. Each moment group includes one \\"pure\\" type, designated with the simple letter, and a number of \\"mixed\\" types containing \\"influences\\" from the other types, designated with multiple letters. These occur on four hierarchical levels, the first being the level of the three pure moments. In the second level, only a slight degree of influence from one other type occurs (about 30%), and is indicated with lowercase, bracketed letters, e.g., M(k) and M(d) in the M group . On the third level, there is a nearly equal balance between two types, and the letters are capitals, such as MK and MD in the M group; each of these is partnered by a neighbouring moment that adds a slighter influence from the third type, e.g., MK(d) and MD(k). The fourth level is found only in the D group, and includes DKM, the only moment in which all three types are balanced, as well as three partially \\"self-reflexive\\" moments, D(d‚Äìm), DK(d), and DK(k). The M group also adds one entirely self- reflective moment, but on the third level: moment M(m). A basic duration is assigned to each moment according to its level. The pure M, K, and D moments are each to last two minutes; the second-level moments each last one minute; the third- and fourth-level ones thirty and fifteen seconds, respectively . However, in many cases these basic durations are extended in actual performance, in part because of inserted material, and in part because many of the moments can or must be repeated. Sometimes the repetition of a moment involves a considerable change of speed. For example, DK(d) has a basic duration of fifteen seconds, but upon repetition is performed four times slower. Consequently, its actual duration is five times longer, at a minute and a quarter . With the exception of M(m), each moment at a lower hierarchical level is attached to a pair of moments on the next higher level, and the members of that higher pair may be exchanged, in order to prepare a version for a particular performance . In addition to this mobile condition of the moments, the internal elements (\\"partial moments\\") of six of the eight M moments (M(k), M(d), MD, MK, MD(k), and the central M moment itself) are also rearrangeable . To these three main groupings of moments are added four I (\\"informal\\", or \\"indeterminate\\") moments, which are used to frame and separate the three main sections: > I(d) always stands between the M and K groups, I(k) always between the K and > D groups. ‚Ä¶ The I(m) moment is independent and can stand at the beginning, > or before or after I(k); according to its position it will be read either > forwards or backwards. Moment I always stands at the end. The I moments are the longest moments in the work, and serve to neutralize the others . As originally planned, I (the final, \\"praying\\" moment) was to last eight minutes, and I(k), I(d), and I(m) four minutes each. This would have meant their combined duration of twenty minutes would have been equal to that of the other twenty-six moments combined. However, in the compositional working-out, the durations of I and I(m) were increased to about ten and five minutes, respectively, and I(k) was even more drastically expanded, to more than twenty minutes‚Äîas long as all the other I moments put together . Inserts Once the order of the moments has been determined, \\"inserts\\" are made from some moments into the immediately preceding or following moment, according to a complex set of rules. These inserts may take on some of the characteristics of the host moment. In the D group, for example, most of the inserts must be transposed to match the central tone of the host moment. Reception Programme for the world premiere of Momente (first version), on 21 May 1962 Momente caused a sensation at the first (partial) performance in Cologne on 21 May 1962, in part because the moment used to begin that version, the so-called \\"clapping moment\\" I(m), begins with applause in the choirs. This was seen by some as a mockery of the audience, but by others as a means of intensifying the connection between audience and performers (; ; ). Besides the opening I(m) moment, this first version consisted of just two of the M and all of the K moments, separated by the I(d) \\"organ moment\\". Kleinhans Music Hall in Buffalo, New York, venue for the North American premiere of Momente on 1 March 1964 This version was also heard in the first American performance, at Kleinhans Music Hall in Buffalo, New York, on 1 March 1964 . At the Donaueschingen Festival in October 1965, an expanded version was given, which added the remaining M moments and the I(i) \\"praying\\" moment, which is meant to conclude all versions. This version, with additions composed in the summer of 1963 and early 1964, was perceived as more good-humoured and less confrontational than the first version . A recording of this version was released on the Wergo and Nonesuch labels. Completion of the D moments was only accomplished in 1969, and the first complete performance took place in Bonn on 8 December 1972, in a version beginning with the newly composed, 25-minute-long I(k) moment, which is very different from the previously composed moments and which some critics at the time felt was out of proportion to and out of character with the rest (; ; ). Rudolph Frisius simply regards the original \\"applause\\" moment beginning as being characteristic of the \\"informal\\" music in the spirit of the early sixties, whereas the new beginning of the 1972 version looks forward, in its evocative ritual gestures, to Stockhausen's works of the seventies .

History Set in the highland plateau, it was founded in 1810 after an extensive forest calamity in this area. Count Forg√°ch, the owner of the forests, brought the first group of loggers from Orava region. Soon came the shepherds, and later on the glassmakers from regions of Kysuce and Moravian Wallachia. The central village has been extended into further parts forming numerous dispersed communities called in Slovak \\"lazy\\" - e.g. Kysuca (originally called Otilia after the daughter of Count Forg√°ch), Sedm√°k and others. Glass foundries in the area disappeared after World War I. Since then, the locals provided forest labour, some dedicated to not very profitable agriculture and the local crafts - manufacture of wooden shingles, weaving cloth and cloth rugs. After World War II people started to commute to work to nearest towns Podbrezov√° and Utek√°ƒç and the village began to rapidly shrink in number. The Kysuca community was depopulated by authorities in the 1980s, which means it has very well preserved wooden folk architecture set in pristine nature.

At the upper end of the village are mineral water springs. History A long distance road between the Spi≈° and Horehronie regions has passed through the valley since antiquity. A rare archaeological finding of a barbarian hoard from the Early Iron Age (Balas 1960,70) is recorded in the town's cadastre - probably an excavation of the Puchov culture. The village was founded at the beginning of the seventeenth century under the Vlach law. The oldest written mention of the village dates back to 1612. The indigenous people were engaged in shepherding and wood processing. In the eighteenth century, iron ore mines were opened and an ironworks was built. The construction of houses for workers of the Pohorel√° ironworks established the current neighboring settlement, Pohorelsk√° Ma≈°a. In about 1830, ownership of the ironworks passed to Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and the administration was moved to Pohorel√°. After extensive modernization, the Pohorel√° complex became the most important iron producer in what was then the Hungarian county of G√∂m√∂r √©s Kishont. By 1844, the industrial complex along the Hron River consisted of 2 smelters, 15 forges, 3 sheet rolling mills, and 2 iron bar rolling mills. The area was long a part of the Hungarian half of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The independence of Czecho- Slovakia was first announced in Pohorel√° on or about the 30th of October, 1918. Though a civic guard was formed, the village experienced some instability over the following months. The first elections for the National Assembly took place in 1920, with the Slovak National Party winning the majority of votes in the village.History of Village Pohorel√° Official Municipal Webpage During the Slovak National Uprising (SNP), partisans of the Katru≈°inov section of the J√°no≈°√≠k Brigade - named for the 18th century Slovak highwayman, Juraj J√°no≈°√≠k - were active in the vicinity of Pohorel√°.

A particular favorite of enlisted men in the Union army, it was written in 1863 by Walter Kittredge and first performed in that year at Old High Rock, Lynn, Massachusetts. A tableau vivant was given on May 29, 1897, in the auditorium of Girls High School (San Francisco) by Union Army veterans, at right, who sang Tenting on the Old Camp Ground. A Methodist camp meeting variant appeared with title \\"Tenting Again\\" in 1869, using the same tune but words modified for the religious environment., edited by Lewis Hartsough, No. 64. The lyrics of this version convey a sense that, regardless of wars past, the struggle against evil continues.

Paleontology , paleoanthropologists tend to regard the search for a precise point of hominization as somewhat irrelevant, seeing the process as gradual. Anatomically modern humans (AMH, or AMHS) developed within the species Homo sapiens about 200,000 years ago. Many thinkers have attempted to explain hominization ‚Äì from Classical times through Hobbes, Rousseau, Hegel, and Engels, who wrote an essay on The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man. The contemporary study of hominization in archeology often looks for signs that mark out human habitations from pre-human forms: for example, the use of grave goods.The Part played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man Karl Marx, Dialectics of nature, Ch. 09 Philosophy and theology In ancient philosophy, \\"hominization\\" referred to the ensoulment of the human fetus. When the soul is said to enter the fetus at some time later than conception, this is sometimes called \\"delayed hominization\\", as in the Aristotelian belief in ensoulment 40 days after conception.. For a refutation of \\"delayed hominization\\", see also this article by Benedict Ashley.On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle, Book II In the context of modern theistic evolution, \\"hominization\\" refers to the theory that there was a point at which a population of hominids who had (or may have) evolved by a process of evolution acquired souls and thus (with their descendants) became fully human in theological terms. This group might be restricted to Adam and Eve, or indeed to Mitochondrial Eve, although versions of the theory allow for larger populations. The point at which this occurred should essentially be the same as in paleoanthropology and archeology, but theological discussion of the matter tends to concentrate on the theoretical. The term \\"special transformism\\" refers to theories of a divine intervention of some sort, achieving hominization.Rahner, Karl, Encyclopedia of Theology: A Concise Sacramentum Mundi, section \\"Hominization\\" by Karl Rahner in entry on \\"Evolution\\", pp. 484-488, 1975, Continuum International Publishing Group, , 9780860120063, google books The process and means by which hominization occurs is a key problem in theistic evolutionary thought, at least for the Abrahamic religions, for which the belief that animals do not have souls but humans do is a core teaching. Scientific accounts of the origin of the universe, origin of life and subsequent evolution of pre-human life forms may not cause any difficulty (helped by the reluctance of science itself to say anything about what preceded the Big Bang) but the need to reconcile religious and scientific views of hominization and account for the addition of a soul to humans remains a problem. Several 19th-century theologians attempted specific solutions, including the Catholics John Augustine Zahm and St. George Jackson Mivart, but tended to come under attack from both the theological and biological camps.The six leading examples are the subject of Artigas's book. Each of these has a chapter in Artigas: L√©roy, Zahm, Bonomelli, Mivart, the English Bishop John Hedley, and Raffaello Caverni. All are also covered by Brundell. 20th-century thinking has tended to avoid proposing precise mechanisms.Kung, 94‚Äì95 Literature This term is used to describe the tendency to attribute human characteristics to entities that are other than human.

History You and Yours began broadcasting in October 1970, when its first presenter was Joan York. In the 1980s it briefly ran seven days a week. In April 1998 it was increased from a 25-minute programme to 55 minutes. However, in 2014 the running time was reduced to approximately 40 minutes to make space for Radio 4's World War I drama Home Front which went out between 12.04 and 12.15. In the months when Home Front was not broadcast a different programme took its place and You and Yours continued to begin at 12.15. On 14 October 2008 there was a change of format, with two presenters being replaced by one. The breadth of topics covered was extended to global problems as well as those closer to home. The programme continues to cover a wide range of topics, and now broadcasts on themes of medical interest as well as consumer issues. For example, on 8 May 2012, a considerable proportion of the programme was devoted to cancer care. Other medical themes that have been discussed on the programme include dementia and diabetes mellitus. The Tuesday edition of the programme takes the form of a phone-in on a consumer matter and is referred to as Call You and Yours. Winifred Robinson is the usual presenter for most of the week, with Peter White presenting the show on Fridays. Shari Vahl often works as a reporter on the show but sometimes stands in as the main presenter, while Louise Minchin also stands in as the main presenter from time to time. On 9 January 2018, Winifred Robinson did not present the programme. The focus of this edition was fair pay for women in the aftermath of the resignation by Carrie Gracie from her post as the BBC's China Editor and her claim that the BBC was guilty of pay discrimination. Robinson had publicly given support for Ms Gracie and was replaced due to \\"impartiality issues\\". Shari Vahl presented this edition of the programme instead. It is edited by Chas Watkin and currently has a weekly audience of three and a half million. It is followed by a weather forecast which precedes The World at One. Transmissions You and Yours is transmitted on Mondays to Fridays at 12.18 and runs for approximately 40 minutes. The programme has a weekly podcast and it is possible to listen to each item in the programme via its website.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 13 February 1998. Will was a regular on the show from 1998 to 2002. He continued to make frequent guest appearances until 2005. In 2010, it was announced that the character and Drayson would be returning to the show. Will returned to the series as a guest with his daughter on 14 October 2010. On 7 February 2011, Will was finally revealed to have been the murderer of Penn Graham after a long running storyline. He left the series on 8 February 2011. Casting Drayson was originally cast in the role of Tom Nash, but at the last minute the show's producers thought he would be more suited to the \\"rougher\\" upcoming role of Will. Drayson played Will for four years from 1998. The character left Summer Bay after marrying Gypsy Nash (Kimberley Cooper). Drayson made occasional guest appearances in the show from 2003 to 2005. In September 2010, it was revealed that Drayson had reprised his role of Will and would be returning to Home and Away. Drayson revealed that a friend of his is a producer on the show and asked him about coming back. Drayson has said that he is going to be around for a while, but he is not signed for three or four years. Will arrives in town with his daughter, Lily (Charlie Rose Maclennan), to visit his former foster mother, Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) after his marriage suffers problems. On his character's return, Drayson said \\"He and Gypsy are going through a rough patch, so he comes home to clear his head. They're not divorced - they're just having a break.\\" He added \\"Being back is great, it really did feel like coming home.\\" Character development Will was originally described as a \\"hot-tempered trouble maker\\" who arrives in the Bay to reconnect with his siblings, Hayley (Rebecca Hewitt) and Nick (Chris Egan). Will learns to calm down and when he decides to leave the Bay he was, by then, considered a \\"good bloke\\". Will worked for Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) and he managed to get his coxswain's licence. He also had a close relationship with Irene Roberts and he and his siblings lived with her at the Beach House. When Will returns in 2010, his marriage to Gypsy has broken down as they began drifting apart. Will decides to go back to Summer Bay and spend time with Irene. Will is now described as a \\"loving father\\" who would do anything for his daughter, Lily. However, his temper occasionally gets the better of him. On playing Will, Drayson said \\"I love playing Will and I think there is something new in Will, he's a bit rougher around the edges, he's a lot more confused and gets into more trouble. I think he tries really hard to be a good Dad, but he gets lost in his own things like most humans do I suppose.\\" When Penn Graham (Christian Clark) is murdered, Will becomes a suspect. He later tells Robert Robertson (Socrattis Otto) that Alf might be responsible. However Will knows more than he was letting on so he runs away, describing Will ordeal Drayson states: \\"Will knows more about Penn's death than meets the eye, he lied about Alf being involved, though we don't yet know what his motives are. It could be that he's covering up for himself or someone else, or it could be something totally different - but he's certainly got something to hide.\\" Irene tries to convince Will to do the right thing, but he cannot think clear, describing Will's state of mind during the storyline Drayson adds: \\"Will is under a lot of pressure and not thinking clearly, he doesn't know what lies in store, and is on a real downward spiral. He has some tough choices to make in the hours ahead. Lilly means everything to Will, He's trying to be a good dad, but unfortunately doesn't go about it the right way. He's way out of his depth, basically\\" Storylines Will came from a broken home, his father Ken (Anthony Phelan) was an alcoholic and his mother Eve (Robin Gibbes) was violent and ended up in a mental home. After running away from a foster home and ending up on the streets, Will meets up with Damian Roberts (Matt Doran) and learns that his mother Irene was in the habit of taking in children. He arrives Summer Bay and on Irene's doorstep, claiming Damian had said he could stay. Will tries to reunite his family, specifically his younger siblings Hayley and Nick. He sets about try to clear Irene's house by encouraging Chloe Richards (Kristy Wright) to move in with her boyfriend James Fraser (Michael Piccirilli) and tries to drive a rift between Irene and Joey Rainbow (Alex O'Han) by telling them both that the other has been badmouthing them. This fails as Hayley and Nick are happy in foster care and Will apologises for his actions and agrees to stay on at Irene's house. Will is not happy as one of the conditions of his stay is he has to return to school, but he quickly becomes good friends with his classmate Sam Marshall (Ryan Clark). Will takes an interest in Gypsy but their relationship is hampered by the fact that her father, Joel Nash (David Woodley), was the new PE teacher and clashed with Will on his first day. Joel soon warms to Will and encourages him to try out for the school javelin team. Annoyed at the idea of her boyfriend and her father being friends, Gypsy tells Will that Joel is only interested in him because he could win him trophies, so Will deliberately gets himself disqualified from a competition. He and Joel eventually iron out their differences, especially when Joel helps clear him when he is accused of robbing a stallholder. Will and Gypsy's relationship is frequently tested, such as both being grilled after they were locked in the school overnight after sneaking away at a concert. They fall out after Will is dismissive after their first attempt of intimacy. Gypsy becomes jealous when she sees him hanging around with a new girl. The girl is revealed to be his sister Hayley who left her foster parents and decided to come and live with him. Joey is diagnosed with schizophrenia and Will helps Irene cope with the fallout. When Irene leaves to visit her daughter Finlay (Tina Thomsen), Will, Hayley and Joey stay with Ailsa Stewart (Judy Nunn). When Ailsa's son Duncan (Brendan McKensy) frames Joey for taking a meat cleaver and Ailsa asks him to leave, Will insists on going with him, although he is not so convinced about Joey's state of mind to let Hayley come with them, until she realises what Duncan has done. Nick turns up on the run from some drug dealers and is beaten up as a result, Will urges Nick's foster parents not to give up on him. Will supports Gypsy when she succumbs to alcoholism after her kidnap ordeal at the hands of David D'Angelo (Toni Poli), her tutor who used the pseudonym Robert Perez. He dates Peta Janossi (Aleetza Wood) and helps cover for her upon learning her grandmother had died and she and her brother David ware living alone. Irene finds out and arranges for Peta to stay with the Nashes. However, Will is clearly still hung up on Gypsy and he and Peta break up and he reunites with Gypsy. His father Ken turns up, much to Will's annoyance. He is concerned when Ken begins seeing Irene and, when he begins drinking again, Will and Hayley force him to leave until he recovers. Ken returns some months later, having sobered up and successfully lobbies for Nick to return. Will eventually accepts his father has changed and the pair strike up a close relationship. After learning Gypsy has been cheating on him with rich kid Charlie Nicholas (Toby Schmitz), Will is furious and vandalises the school field with a motorbike and is given community service as a result. Will sets his sights on Dani Sutherland (Tammin Sursok) who is new in Summer Bay. Their relationship suffers its first test when Tara Mills becomes infatuated with Will after he helps her out. Will is happy when Ken and Irene become engaged but it is not to be as Ken is killed when a jack slips under the car he is working on, leaving him crushed. Will blames himself as he lifted the car off Ken which released the pressure, quickening his death. Will then takes his role as man of the house seriously by dropping out of school and working for Alf as a deckhand. Hayley and Nick are annoyed when he tries to be a father figure to them but Irene persuades him to stop. Will's relationship with Dani hits a rough patch when she becomes jealous of him spending time with Gypsy. Will and Gypsy sleep together but he returns to Dani and supports her after she is raped by Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell). Will is forced to admit in court that Dani had said it wasn't Kane's fault and Kane is acquitted. He learns he is the father of Gypsy's unborn baby after months of her keeping it from him. Dani finds out while Will is away in London and on his return she initially breaks up with him before giving him another chance. However, it becomes clear Gypsy will always have to come first to Will and they split up for good. Will and Gypsy then reunite and get engaged shortly after their daughter, Lily is born at the roadside. Will then takes a job in Queensland, close to Gypsy's family. As they are unable to get a marriage license; Will and Gypsy have an unofficial ceremony before legally marrying the following month in Queensland. Will continues to make various reappearances. He returns to the Bay when he and Gypsy begin having problems and considers getting back together with Dani who is now dating Scott Hunter (Kip Gamblin). He is horrified to find Kane back in the Bay and seemingly accepted by Irene and everyone else. Will then returns home to salvage his marriage. He returns the following year for Hayley's wedding to Noah Lawson (Beau Brady), where he reveals to Jesse that his daughter Rachel, who had been staying with the Nashes, has asked him and Gypsy to adopt her. After mulling it over, Jesse agrees. Will is next seen at Alf's 60th birthday and then again for Hayley's abortive wedding to Kim Hyde (Chris Hemsworth). Will returns to the Bay with his daughter, Lily. Penn Graham is murdered and Will is eventually revealed to have committed the crime. It is learned Will stabbed Penn in self-defence and he is charged and his fate remains ambiguous.

These quantitative properties may be used as a metric by which the benefits of one material versus another can be compared, thereby aiding in materials selection. A property may be a constant or may be a function of one or more independent variables, such as temperature. Materials properties often vary to some degree according to the direction in the material in which they are measured, a condition referred to as anisotropy. Materials properties that relate to different physical phenomena often behave linearly (or approximately so) in a given operating range. Modeling them as linear can significantly simplify the differential constitutive equations that the property describes. Some materials are used in relevant equations to predict the attributes of a system a priori. The properties are measured by standardized test methods.

Gypsy and her on-screen family the Nashes were introduced to fill the void of Debra Lawrance's departure as Pippa Ross, to form the main family at the caravan park home, often described as \\"the centre of Summer Bay\\". Cooper quit the serial in 2001 and last appeared on 15 February 2002. Cooper has won two awards for her portrayal of Gypsy and is often referred to as a \\"sex symbol\\" of the serial. In June 2011, it was announced that Cooper had reprised her role as Gypsy. She returned on 9 September 2011 and departed on 13 October 2011. Character creation and casting In 1997, after Debra Lawrance quit her role as Pippa Ross producers decided to introduce a new family to run the caravan park, because the household was seen as the \\"centrepiece of the show\\". They created the Nash family consisting of Gypsy played by Cooper, sibling Tom (Graeme Squires) and their parents Natalie and Joel Nash played by Angelica la Bozzetta and David Woodley respectively. The family come to Summer Bay from Hong Kong to start a new life. Cooper later spoke fondly of the serial, stating: \\"I never look at Home and Away and cringe [...] Unapologetically it's good TV for the time that it is made in.\\" In 2009 executive producer Cameron Welsh stated he would love to see Cooper return as Gypsy. In 2010, Zac Drayson who plays Cooper's on-screen husband Will Smith revealed that Cooper wanted to return alongside him, but could not commit to filming because of her wedding commitments. In June 2011, it was announced that Cooper had reprised her role as Gypsy and had returned to filming in May. Cooper confirmed that Gypsy's return would be \\"dramatic, in true Gypsy style\\". Gypsy returned with her daughter Lily in September 2011. Storylines Gypsy arrives in Summer Bay, her father's old home town, with her father Joel, mother Natalie and older brother Tom. She is not used to the quieter pace of life in the bay and prefers the busy environment of a city, having grown up in Hong Kong. While Rollerblading, Gypsy falls down and is helped up by Travis Nash (Nic Testoni), who Joel reveals to be her uncle. She soon learns that Joel and Travis had not spoken since Joel left town after their father, Jack (John Grant), her grandfather behaved inappropriately towards Natalie. Both branches of the Nashes soon reconcile. Vinnie Patterson (Ryan Kwanten) takes an interest in Gypsy but she rebuffs him after learning he is involved with Justine Welles (Bree Desborough). Will Smith catches Gypsy's eye and she purchases dope in order to impress him but the plan backfires when Joel and Travis find in the fridge and Gypsy reports the dealer, Lillian Reynolds (Nitya Gehl) to the school. Gypsy, Justine and Tiegan Brook (Sally Marrett) form a band called the Broken Dolls, managed by Vinnie. After their first performance at a school dance, Gypsy and Will sneak off to a classroom to spend time together and end up trapped in the school for the night. Joel is furious when he finds out and tries to split them up. However, after Joel begins to approve of Will, Gypsy loses interest. They later reunite but split again after Will treats the matter of intimacy casually. Gypsy briefly dates Sam Marshall (Ryan Clark) but does not see him other than a friend. Gypsy then begins seeing her tutor Robert Perez (Tony Poli). Nobody is aware that Robert is actually David D'Angelo, a criminal who Joel had imprisoned fifteen years earlier. He kidnaps Gypsy and forces her to record a message, which is sent to the family. Gypsy sneaks in a clue to her location and is rescued. David then sets fire to the house nearly killing the family. Travis saves Gypsy and David is finally arrested. The Nashes move in with Travis and his wife Rebecca (Belinda Emmett) and Gypsy befriends their foster children, Justine and Peta Janossi (Aleetza Wood). Gypsy and Will remain close despite not dating and Gypsy starts seeing Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin). The age difference worries a few people but her parents cautiously approve. Gypsy, however, soon finds the relationship dull as Jesse is a single father. She meets a man online and agrees to meet him at the surf club only to discover that her secret admirer is Tom, who in turn had no idea he was talking to Gypsy, much to their mutual horror. Mitch McColl (Cameron Welsh) arrives and he and Gypsy date for a while but she backs off when he realises Hayley Smith (Bec Cartwright) likes him. Gypsy later sleeps with Mitch and it causes friction with Hayley and their other friends. When Tom takes Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) boat out for a rich kid's party, he asks Gypsy to help out. She soon takes a liking to the birthday boy, Charlie Nicholas (Toby Schmitz), and starts dating him, even though she is still seeing Will. She quickly realises Charlie had a drink problem but enjoyed the party lifestyle too much. Gypsy soon sobers up when she discovers Natalie has been an affair with an old friend, Glen Tanner (Craig Elliot), and he is the father of her unborn child. Immediately afterwards, Charlie's drinking involves the pair in a car accident resulting in Charlie's death and Gypsy receiving serious injuries. Gypsy then bonds with Natalie, who like herself is, vilified for an affair and is upset when she and Tom leave the Bay, leaving Gypsy alone with Joel. Kieran Fletcher (Spencer McLaren), Sally's fianc√© makes advances towards Gypysy and taunts her by saying no-one will believe her. Gypsy remains silent until halfway through the wedding when she announces what has been going on. Hayley and Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood) confirm this and Sally jilts Kieran. Joel and Gypsy move back into Joel's old family home with Vinnie. Gypsy then takes a job at the local Drop-in-center and forms a close bond with boss Shelley Sutherland (Paula Forrest) but things are made uncomfortable by the fact that her daughter, Dani (Tammin Sursok) is seeing Will. Gypsy begins seeing Harry Reynolds (Justin Melvey). Charlie's ex, Kirsten (Christa Nicola) makes a hoax call to Gypsy telling her Harry is dead and is arrested as a result. Gypsy and Harry's relationship crumbles when she finds out he still has feeling for Shauna. Gypsy finds herself developing romantic feelings for Shelley. She then goes out with Desiree Upton (Simone Robertson) and shares a kiss and realises she is not a lesbian. Gypsy later sleeps with Will and she soon falls pregnant and lies about the baby's paternity but Sally and Tom soon realise the truth. Will eventually realises he is the father and Gypsy considers leaving town but eventually accepts Will has a right to choose to be involved. They reunite after Will and Dani break up and Gypsy moves in with him. She gives birth to a daughter, Lily by the roadside with Will supporting her. Will proposes and Gypsy accepts. After accepting a job in Queensland near Gypsy's family, they have a symbolic wedding ceremony as a marriage license will not be available for four weeks. They later marry legally in Queensland. They later adopt Jesse's Daughter, Rachel (Sarah Mumcu). When Will returns to the Bay in 2010, he reveals he had cheated on Gypsy and they have separated. Gypsy returns the following year in 2011 to see Irene, following her breast cancer diagnosis. Gypsy and Lily (Charlie Rose Maclennan) move in with Irene, Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and April Scott (Rhiannon Fish). Gypsy tells Irene she is dating a man named Mark Gilmour (Shane Emmett), but he and Lily do not get on well. Gypsy tries to help care for Irene and she gets on Bianca's nerves. Gypsy is attracted to Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) and she organises a gig for him at the restaurant. Mark comes to visit Gypsy and he and Lily clash. Mark later suggests sending Lily to boarding school, but Gypsy disagrees with the idea. She later has sex with Liam on the beach, but they are interrupted by Bianca. Lily tells Mark and he and Gypsy break up. Irene tells Gypsy to leave and she and Lily pack up and go home. Reception At the 41st Logie Awards Cooper won the \\"Most Popular New Female Talent\\" award for her portrayal of Gypsy,. she was the first ever recipient of the award. Gypsy's kidnapping was nominated for \\"Most Dramatic Storyline\\" at the 1999 Inside Soap Awards. The following year, Cooper won an award in the \\"Best Aussie actress\\" category. In 2002, Chris Middendorp of The Age said Gypsy was a \\"schoolgirl tart\\" who dominated the 2000 season of Home and Away as \\"she explored romantic opportunity in all the wrong places - rich playboys, schoolboys, older men. She finally embraced true love with young Will, one of her first boyfriends.\\" Soap opera reporting website Holy Soap included Gypsy on their list of \\"Sexiest Home and Away girls ever\\" list. They also brand her most memorable moments as \\"being kidnapped and having a baby with Will Smith\\". The Courier- Mail include Cooper on their list of sexiest ever Home and Away characters. In his book Super Aussie Soaps, author Andrew Mercado criticised the Nash family because of their Hong Kong origin, stating: \\"Was Summer Bay finally turning multicultural and getting an Asian family? Fat Chance. They were middle-class Causasians just like everyone else in the Bay (and Neighbours' Ramsay Street).\\" Jon Horsley of Yahoo! was happy that Gypsy was returning to the serial and said \\"It‚Äôs always nice to have a nostalgic favourite return.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Character profile at the Official Home and Away website Home and Away characters Television characters introduced in 1998 Fictional waiting staff Female characters in television ","title":"Gypsy Nash"},{"id":"6318979","text":"Telg√°rt (, called ≈†vermovo in 1948‚Äì1990) is a village and municipality in Brezno District, in the Bansk√° Bystrica Region of central Slovakia.

Robb's in Death series. Major characters Consists of characters that typically appear in every book, whether their role be large or small, and are part of Eve's immediate circle of acquaintances. Characters are in order of appearance.  Eve Dallas  * First Appearance: Naked in Death *DOB: 2028 Eve Dallas is the main character of the In Death novels. Eve was found in an alley in Dallas, Texas. She was estimated to be eight years old. She had a broken arm, was covered in old blood, and unable to remember anything at all. She showed evidence of extensive physical and sexual abuse. Her social worker named her and put Eve into a foster home, the beginning of Eve's life in the system. After reaching the age of majority, Eve has a big desire to move to New York City, where she hopes to become a police officer. The dates of all her promotions are not specific, but it is mentioned that she became a detective second grade in early 2051, and eventually, by the start of the series, is lieutenant in the Homicide squad. Throughout the series, her memories return, mostly through a series of nightmares, revealing a history of incestual rape and the patricide of her father, Richard Troy. It is revealed that he was raising her to prostitute her to child molesters. Her mother, Stella, was a prostitute and a drug addict and was occasionally beaten and raped by Troy, but hated her daughter. Eve finds out more about Stella in book 34, New York to Dallas. It was implied that since Eve had lost her memory, she had forgotten her name as well, but it is eventually revealed in Reunion in Death that the reason Eve cannot remember her name is because her parents never gave her one. The fact that no one in Dallas could track down her ID indicates one of two things: that either Homeland Security interfered and deleted her data, or that her parents had never registered her in the first place. For all intents and purposes, Eve did not exist in any records before she was eight years old. After her relationship with and subsequent marriage to Roarke, Eve is a much happier and, to some extent, calmer person; she is more willing to work with and depend on other people. They celebrate their one-year anniversary in Reunion in Death, in July 2059. Eve's relationship with Roarke is central to the series and her character. Eve's official residence is 222 Central Park West, New York, NY, with Roarke.  Roarke  * First Appearance: Naked in Death *DOB: 10/03/2024 Roarke is one of the main characters of the In Death novels. In his mid-thirties, he is an immigrant from Dublin, Ireland; in New York City, he is the CEO of Roarke Industries, and one of the richest men in the world, possibly the richest. He owns an old mansion off Central Park that he remodeled to his specifications with very high-tech security. Also in the home is his own personal collection of firearms, which are illegal in 2058 unless one possesses a collector's license. Roarke also owns maces, swords, daggers, medieval armor, and other assorted weapons. He is quite skilled in electronics and can dismantle any type of security, lock, or coding, as well as hack into any electronic database--including but not limited to those of the FBI, Interpol, and Homeland Security. He convinces Eve to move in with him in Glory in Death and then proposes at the end of the book. Roarke's house officially becomes a home once Eve moves in, and after this, Roarke is happiest at home rather than traveling. He also enjoys helping Eve with her cases, finding the role reversal quite entertaining. He finds out in Portrait in Death that he is a year younger (b. 2024 not 2023) than what he thought he was. Captain Ryan Feeney * First Appearance: Naked in Death Eve's former partner and the man who trained her, picking her up as an officer after finding her working a crime scene. He no longer works Homicide, but is instead the captain of the Electronics Detection Division (EDD). Feeney is an apparently relaxed man who likes to dress a bit messily and loves his electronics; that said, he is a dedicated cop who is apparently a good husband to his wife, Sheila. They have several children and grandchildren. He is often seen eating a bag of candied nuts, which he may offer to Eve when they are deep in conversation about a case. His former partner, DS Wojinsky, and Wojinsky's granddaughter, Feeney's goddaughter, are murdered in Ceremony in Death. Eve is the primary investigator, which causes friction between her and Feeney during the course of the book. Feeney fights with and temporarily breaks the relationship between himself and Eve; however, Roarke intervenes and tells Feeney that the man who raped Eve as a child was her own father, and that since Eve and Feeney met, Feeney has been her true father figure, although neither of them would ever discuss this with the other. Given that Feeney was Eve's trainer and former partner for years, a great deal of Eve's personal and professional habits mimic his. Roarke has observed on several occasions (in Divided in Death and others) that Eve really is just like Feeney. Feeney is one of the few people who knows that Homeland Security covered up Richard Troy's death by his daughter's hand. Mavis Freestone * First Appearance: Naked in Death Mavis is Eve's best and first real friend. The two met when Eve was an officer. Since Eve was promoted to Detective when she was twenty-three, they met sometime between 2046 and 2051. Eve arrested her for being a con artist - several times - and the two ended up becoming friends. Eve often describes her as \\"pixie-like\\". Mavis is described as a tiny, pale woman (in contrast to her husband, Leonardo who is large and copper-coloured). Unless Mavis is upset, she radically changes her appearance daily, sporting different lengths, styles, and colors of hair with often matching or contrasting eye color. She is often described wearing jewel colors, and bouncing around. Her favorite expressions are \\"mag\\" as in 'magnificent', \\"iced\\" or \\"frosty\\" as in \\"cool\\" or \\"ult\\" as in \\"ultimate\\". She tends to expand or riff on these when she is excited. Mavis is originally a singer in a club called the Blue Squirrel: it's a very low-class club where Mavis typically performed half-naked. Throughout the books, Mavis eventually gets a recording deal (she actually is quite talented) through one of Roarke's recording companies, and becomes a hugely popular music and vid star. She has an almost innocent personality which belies the very real street knowledge she possesses; she is also very loyal to Eve, wanting nothing but the best for her, and always knows what Eve needs. She knows about Eve's past, but it is not clear if she knows that Eve killed her father. Nevertheless, Mavis would probably agree with the course of action. Mavis tells Eve she is pregnant with Leonardo's baby in Purity in Death; she marries him in the delivery room during Born in Death. Summerset gives her away and offers his wife's ring, which he wore on a chain around his neck, until they can find another ring. Shortly afterwards, with Leonardo, Roarke and Eve as her coaches, Mavis gives birth to a baby girl, named Isabella Eve, who is more often referred to as Belle. Lawrence Charles Summerset * First Appearance: Naked in Death He is technically Roarke's majordomo, who runs Roarke's house. In practice, he is Roarke's most trusted friend, after Eve. He used to go by the name 'Basil Kolchek' back in Ireland in the 2030s. His wife, and daughter Marlena, are both dead when the series begins. During the series' fictional \\"Urban Wars\\", a time of urban unrest, Summerset served as a medical aide, also working with the title doctor from Origin in Death. When Roarke was ten, he met Summerset and Marlena, then aged eight. They ran cons together; shortly after, Summerset found Roarke half- beaten to death in an alley (by Patrick Roarke, his father); he saved him and nursed him back to health.Immortal in Death, pg 90 paperback Roarke mentions (somewhat conflictingly) later that he thought Summerset was a mark and tried to steal from him, but as Roarke said, Summerset \\"dissuaded him of that notion\\".Memory in Death Shortly thereafter, Patrick Roarke turned up dead in an alley, stabbed in the throat and robbed of all money and valuables - supposedly a victim of a mugging. It was a surprisingly innocuous death for a very dangerous man, and Eve realizes in Portrait in Death that it is Summerset who in fact killed Patrick. Summerset says that he did it because he had \\"children to protect.\\"Portrait in Death Roarke does not know as of Celebrity in Death and neither Eve nor Summerset see any reason to tell him. When Roarke was sixteen, he was running a small gambling ring. His competitors wanted him gone and having failed to warn him off, they figured that the best way to deliver the message was through Marlena, Summerset's daughter, then aged fourteen. The six men raped, murdered, and mutilated Marlena, and then dumped her corpse on Summerset's doorstep. In revenge, Roarke hunted down and killed those six men over the next decade. These acts form the basis for the plot in Vengeance in Death. When he comes to the U.S., he brings Summerset with him, asking Summerset to become his home's majordomo. In reality, Roarke thinks of Summerset as a father. Despite having Roarke in common, Eve and Summerset spend the majority of the series at odds, each having personality traits that chafe against the other. In Vengeance in Death, Eve realizes why Summerset does not like her. She tells him that she has realised that he always wanted someone like Marlena for Roarke, a sweet and innocent young girl - something Eve has never been. Summerset had not realized the basis of his dislike, and is guilt-stricken over it. In the finale of Vengeance in Death, Eve takes a hit from a stunner meant for Summerset. The overtly adversarial relationship between Eve and Summerset gradually evolves into a matter of course: she often relieves her work-related stress by insulting him; she throws her jacket on the newel post at the foot of the main staircase because she knows it annoys him, and because he expects her to do so. In Conspiracy in Death, it becomes clear that Summerset is merely fulfilling the role of adversary, but has genuine concern for Eve's well-being and grades her states of mind based on the quality of her insults towards him. The heart \\"she didn't know he had\\" squeezes in empathy for her situation: he tells her that she is late for dinner simply to put the thought of food into her mind (he knows she would have forgotten otherwise), and when a pallid and depressed Eve, soaked from walking in the snow, gives a lethargic apology to one of his particularly withering comments, he goes to Roarke and says, \\"I insulted her and she...apologized. Something must be done.\\" On several occasions, the two have had meaningful conversations over their only common interest: Roarke. In Innocent in Death, Summerset fully supports Eve in her dispute with Roarke over Roarke's ex-lover, telling Eve that even though he doesn't like her superficial inability to be a 'social fixture' for someone of Roarke's position, he truly understands that Eve is the one for Roarke because she genuinely loves him and has demonstrated that by repeatedly putting herself in harm's way to protect him, and by unwittingly helping Roarke make his mansion a proper home which includes things like Christmas traditions and frequent meetings of Eve's investigative teams. Summerset's respect for Eve's job is also demonstrated in subtle ways as well, particularly in Origin in Death when he subtly hints how she made history by stopping her adversaries in a high- profile case. Summerset is very fond of Mavis and tends to cater to whatever she wants on her visits: he treats her very affectionately. This may be some indication that Mavis reminds him of Marlena. He gives Mavis away at her wedding, and loans her his own wife's ring, a further indication of a paternal feeling for Mavis, and has also babysat Belle, Mavis's daughter, on several occasions. Belle, unable to say Summerset, calls him \\"Someshit\\", which greatly amuses Eve. He also shows affection and great concern for Peabody and McNab when they have been injured in the line of duty. Commander Jack Whitney * First Appearance: Naked in Death Eve's police commander; her immediate superior, since the NYPSD Homicide department oddly enough does not have a captain. He is one of the few characters in the series, along with the Chief of the NYPSD, Tibble, who is identified as black. Eve respects him greatly. Whitney is a solid, excellent police officer, and for the most part is always on Eve's side. He recognizes that she is an excellent cop; if it weren't for the fact that Eve prefers being on the street, he would have promoted her to captain himself. However, that and the fact that other high-ranking members of the police force frown on her marriage to Roarke have made the promotion more difficult, something he does not agree with. He does not aspire to higher political positions than the one he has (it is stated in Glory in Death that he was offered the role of Chief of Police but elected to remain Commander of Cop Central); he also has been a cop as long as Feeney has, and the two were apparently in uniform together (covered in Ceremony in Death). He has at least one daughter (a lawyer) with his wife, Anna Whitney, and endures stoically the parties his wife loves throwing. He also states in Reunion in Death that he has more than one son as well as grandchildren in another book. In Glory in Death, the victim was a good friend of his, a prosecutor back from when he was on the streets. Because the prime suspects are the victim's family, he is very uncomfortable with the case and subsequently oversteps his boundaries, damaging his relationship with Eve. The relationship is still shaky in Immortal in Death. However, when he finds out that Eve killed her father while he was raping her, he immediately tells Eve that their police department will not open the matter, effectively shutting down the possibility of Eve being indicted for causing Troy's death. He also knows that Homeland Security left Eve to be raped by Richard Troy, and subsequently kill him. Surprising Eve, he gets along very well with Roarke and the two have, on rare occasions, smoked and drunk together. Nadine Furst * First Appearance: Naked in Death * Channel 75 news reporter, on the crime beat. Nadine is one of the intended victims of the murderer in Glory in Death, but is saved by Eve, who is the primary investigator on the case. She is an extremely ambitious reporter, but an ethical one; she will always protect her source (in these books, the source is often Eve) and follows her cases thoroughly. The transactions between Nadine and Eve are usually the same: when Eve is in the early stages of investigating a case, Nadine will call her repeatedly, asking for information. Eve usually responds (or calls back) on the third or fourth call and gives Nadine a few key pieces of information. Nadine will then bribe her way into Eve's office, using baked goods and sweets, such as fudge, doughnuts and chocolate brownies. From there, Eve expects Nadine to do some more digging (which she does more quickly and/or effectively than the police), return the facts to Eve, and ultimately be rewarded with an exclusive interview when the case breaks. When Eve's badge is taken away from her in Conspiracy in Death, Nadine rallies to the cause with a bombardment of news clips and stories, spinning a story about a heroic cop's badge having been unjustly taken away. She and Eve are good friends, and the only reporter Eve truly trusts to properly deliver select media information. They have since become friends, and Nadine attended Eve's bachelorette party in a down-market sex club, The Down and Dirty, where Nadine did a half-naked dance for the crowd. Nadine acquires her own TV show, Now!, in Memory in Death as a direct result of the story Eve fed her in Origin in Death, because the case about human cloning garnered Nadine immense publicity worldwide. Nadine writes a book about the case, The Icove Agenda. The book is later made into a \\"vid\\" (Robb's futuristic terminology for a motion picture), which forms the background to the plot of Celebrity in Death. Nadine teasingly asks Eve (but half-seriously) if they can film some of the Now interviews at Eve's house, to which she answers emphatically no. That said, Eve makes an appearance on the show (with Roarke watching from off-camera) in Innocent in Death, where she is interviewed about the Icove case. As befits a high-profile TV reporter, Nadine is a sharp dresser, a fact Eve (who is bemused about why others pay such attention to their personal appearances) finds odd. Eve often observes throughout the series that Nadine wears high heels, which Nadine says she wears to make her legs look good. Nadine admits to Eve that she struggled to trust people in relationships after a bad experience with Richard Draco, one of the murder victims in Witness in Death, and she only seems to have fairly casual relationships up until Apprentice in Death when she starts a relationship with musician Jake Kincade, who nicknames her Lois after Lois Lane, also an ace reporter. Dr. Charlotte Mira * First Appearance: Naked in Death Mira is the resident psychiatrist and profiler for the NYPSD; Eve comments in Naked in Death that she could have opened a much more profitable private practice, but Charlotte wanted to work with the police. Charlotte tells Eve that she was raped as a child by her stepfather, when she was twelve, and the rapes went on for several years before she finally admitted it. Her mother divorced her stepfather and after counselling, remarried Charlotte's birth father, and her parents are happy to this day. Charlotte has several children with her husband, Dennis Mira, and has grandchildren as well. She is a pretty and feminine woman whom Eve often consults on her cases. These consultations typically take place in Mira's office where Mira and Eve discuss the case and suspect profile over flowery tea. Eve, who prefers coffee, puts up with the tea because she is fond of Mira. Eve loves Charlotte very much but has not admitted it to her face; nevertheless, Charlotte knows. Charlotte thinks of Eve as a daughter, a fact which annoyed Mira's own daughter at one point, and throughout the series has gotten Eve to open up to her more and more. Charlotte knows all about Eve's life: her rapes as a child, her killing of her father in self-defense, her subsequent foster care, subsequent time spent in juvenile detention, her reasons for being a police officer, and her life with Roarke. Charlotte is also one of the few that knows that Homeland Security had a hand in covering up Eve's father's death. Charlotte and Eve experienced some conflict of interest in Origin in Death, since Charlotte was friends with the true villain of the book and deeply disturbed by the man's experiments with human lives. Officer (Detective) Delia Peabody * First Appearance: Glory in Death * Temporary aide in Glory and Immortal in Death * Permanent aide: from Rapture in Death through to Imitation * Partner: Promotion to Detective, third grade in Imitation in Death Although her first name is Delia, she is referred to by her surname 'Peabody' throughout the books, as is standard for other police officers. Peabody comes from a family of \\"Free-Agers\\", which is a fictional extension of the New Age movement from the 1980s. Her family is very peaceful and pacifistic, but Delia prefers exercising justice her way - the police way. She is a very responsible and sober police officer, but as the books continue, her personality relaxes and she is more confident in her cases and in teasing Eve, particularly about her sex life with McNab and her sexual fantasies. Peabody has a very close relationship with the heroine of the book, Eve. Upon being requested to be Eve's aide at the start of the series, Peabody was incredibly grateful for the opportunity as she had studied Eve's cases in the Police Academy and idolizes her. Their relationship grows over time, beyond mentor-mentee to deep friendship. It is for this reason that Eve tells Peabody about her childhood and subsequent act of patricide in Visions in Death. She dates Charles Monroe for a little while starting in Holiday in Death, but she quickly realizes that she thinks of him as a brother. Nevertheless, they continue to spend time together, with many assuming they are in a sexual relationship. Ian McNab is Peabody's lover and later in the series, her co-hab; she meets and clashes with him in his introduction during Vengeance in Death. They start a sexual relationship in Loyalty in Death, with McNab still under the impression that she is also sleeping with Charles. After an argument fuelled by McNab's jealousy, their relationship ends in Betrayal in Death as Peabody is unaware that his rage was due to the fact that he has genuine romantic feelings for her. However, they officially start dating in Seduction in Death. He meets her parents in Reunion in Death, move in together and sign a lease in Visions in Death. She also visits his family in Scotland during Christmas in Memory in Death. Peabody is very happy with him, but as she states to Eve once, she's fine living with him - marriage is very far off. McNab frequently refers to Peabody as \\"She-Body\\", but Peabody herself worries about her weight and, in particular, about the size of her ass. Detective Ian McNab * First Appearance: Vengeance in Death Of a Scottish background, Ian is a detective in Feeney's Electronics Detection Division. He is particularly good with computers (though not as good as Roarke). Ian is also a very flashy dresser, wearing bright, spangly clothes and earrings who, in Eve's words, \\"prances\\" rather than walks. Feeney describes him as a known candy thief, and he has been caught at least once pilfering candy bars from Eve's office. His relationship with Delia Peabody begins as a rocky one. At first he infuriates her, and they have exchanges much like bickering children. He repeatedly calls her \\"She-Body\\", which she finds annoying. That said, their bickering masks a deep attraction which they finally act upon. They begin to date at the same time as Peabody is dating Charles Monroe. Unaware that Delia is not actually sleeping with Charles Monroe, Ian is incredibly jealous. His jealousy peaks in Betrayal in Death, and he fights with Peabody and breaks off his relationship with her. The two are subsequently miserable for several books. After having a fight with Charles Monroe, however, in Seduction in Death, he gets back together with her. Eventually, in Visions in Death, Peabody tells him the true nature of her relationship with Monroe. In Purity in Death, Ian was temporarily paralyzed and tried to break up with Peabody to spare her being stuck with an invalid. She told him where he could put that idea and remained with him, his body waking up again shortly after. He then confessed that he loved her, not wanting to miss the chance to tell her again. Delia does eventually tell him that she never had a romance with Charles, but not until Visions in Death, in which she enjoys Ian's suffering. They are living together by then, in the same building as Mavis and Leonardo, and have exchanged proclamations of love for each other. Detective David Baxter * First Appearance: Vengeance in Death Another detective from Eve's division, Homicide. A very able police officer, he begins making regular appearances in Conspiracy in Death. He was originally a member of the anti-crime division, but transferred over to Homicide well before his first appearance. He enjoys teasing Eve about anything he can, usually relating to her relationship with Roarke and associated changes; despite this teasing Roarke views Baxter as a solid cop and easygoing person. This did not, however, prevent a short altercation between Roarke and Baxter in Conspiracy in Death: when Baxter is responsible for interviewing Eve as a suspect in a homicide, Roarke punches him in the face. Whenever Eve has a fairly large team for a big investigation, she brings Baxter in. He is a bachelor and is described as being good looking; however, he has not been romantically tied to any particular person. Baxter enjoys playing the field. He is nicknamed \\"Horny Dog\\" by Eve and the other members of her unit. In Purity in Death, Eve urges Baxter to take Officer Trueheart under his supervision, meaning that Trueheart serves him the same way Delia did Eve. He admits in rare moments that he's very fond of Trueheart, often referring to him as \\"the kid\\" or \\"the boy.\\" His capabilities as a good cop and trainer are demonstrated through Trueheart's sharpening skills. Baxter (almost always referred to as such) is badly stunned in the end of Survivor in Death, but with no apparent lasting damage. Chief Medical Examiner Li Morris * First Appearance: Rapture in Death Chief Medical Examiner Morris is the medical examiner Eve requests on all of her high-priority cases. He is probably of mixed race background, as he is mentioned as having 'oddly exotic almond-shaped eyes', and sports a small tattoo of the Grim Reaper on his left pectoral. He is a snazzy dresser much like a rock star; he has a long black ponytail which he often ties back with fasteners that match his clothes. He plays the saxophone and sometimes plays gigs at various clubs. He listens to music while performing autopsies and calls Eve his prize pupil for her quick- witted deductions. He plays a major role in 2009's Promises in Death, as the victim of the central case is his girlfriend Detective Amaryllis Coltraine. Morris also reveals that he had an older brother named Jin, who died when he was a boy and whose death led to his choice of profession. Minor characters Consists of characters who typically play small roles and will go many books without occurring again; however, they may play larger roles on the rare occasion. Listed in order of appearance. Galahad * First Appearance: Naked in Death Eve's third victim in \\"Naked in Death\\" is the owner of a cat. As her family does not want to keep the cat, Eve takes him into custody. She keeps him in her apartment, without knowing his name. When the murderer of the book has Eve at gunpoint in her apartment, the cat brushes past his leg, distracting him and giving Eve the leverage she needs to fight back. Eve thus names the cat \\"Galahad\\", after the Arthurian knight, because he was her \\"knight in shining armor\\". He does something similar in New York to Dallas. The cat is Eve's, Roarke's, and Summerset's pet: he is often fed by all of them and takes food as he pleases, and occasionally steals it if he can manage it. On occasion, Eve has had bad dreams from which she wakes up to find Galahad trying to wake and comfort her. On other occasions when Eve falls dead asleep, Galahad sits on her butt. When Nixie, the title character from Survivor in Death, stays at their home, she stays mostly with Galahad, as he comforts her. When Mavis brings Belle for a visit in Creation in Death, Galahad is scared of the baby. Eve mentions later in Memory in Death that the cat has been neutered. The cat makes minor appearances in almost every book. He is described as a fat, heavy and lazy gray cat with dual colored eyes, one green and one gold. Roarke gave Eve a stuffed toy which is a smaller replica of Galahad, because she had never had a doll. Galahad was initially unsure of it but now Eve has returned to the house to find that Galahad has been playing with the toy, a fact she finds slightly disturbing. Anna Whitney * First Appearance: Naked in Death, but her first name is revealed in Glory in Death Anna Whitney is the commander's wife; unlike her husband, she is white, although their interracial marriage has never been explicitly pointed out. They have several children together. Anna mostly terrifies Eve because she is extremely put together, an extremely efficient hostess, and combined with her marriage to the commander, can highly intimidate Eve as well. That said, she is to all appearances a devoted wife and mother. In Glory, Eve finds out that she has given large amounts of cash to the top suspect because he was in gambling debt. In Origin in Death, Commander Whitney specifically calls Eve because his wife has asked him to ask her to keep her plastic surgery details out of the case, a request with which Eve has no difficulty complying. Anna Whitney however understands being a cop's wife and in several books, excels at supporting and comforting the spouses and families of cops who have been killed or have lost family members. In Kindred in Death she fulfills this role and also states that, whilst she finds Eve difficult and abrasive at times, she respects her abilities and would have used every influence she had with Commander Whitney to have Eve assigned to the investigation had the father of the victim not already requested her. Caroline Ewing (Caro) * First Appearance: Naked in Death Roarke's administrator, nicknamed Caro; she is his right hand at his company. She is the mother of Reva Ewing, a former United States Secret Service agent who took a hit for the President of the United States. Caro is an extremely efficient and capable woman; the only time she asks Roarke for his help is in Divided in Death, when her daughter is framed for murder. Other than that, she serves as his assistant, appearing briefly in many of the books. Richard and Elizabeth DeBlass * First Appearance: Naked in Death Richard and Elizabeth DeBlass are lawyers, and Richard is the son of Senator Gerald DeBlass, who murdered their daughter, Sharon. Richard and Elizabeth were unaware that Sharon had been molested regularly as a child by her grandfather, nor did they know that Richard's sister had suffered similarly. In Vengeance in Death, Eve is delivered a message from the killer via a very young boy with a cat, who is abused by his mother and spends his time out on the streets. Roarke finds this information out, and arranges with Child Protective Services for the boy to be placed with Richard and Elizabeth. They eventually adopt him. They are seen again in Survivor in Death when Nixie Swisher's guardians refuse to take her in, following the deaths of Nixie's family and their daughter As Nixie's only remaining relatives are unsuitable or do not want to accept custody of her, Roarke and Eve again contact the DeBlasses, who come to talk to Nixie and then take her into their custody. They are accompanied by the little boy from Vengeance. In Kindred in Death, Roarke reports that Nixie is settling in well. They return in Thankless in Death as guests at Thanksgiving and at Eve and Roarke's award ceremony, where Nixie tells Eve that she is thankful for her, as she found justice for her family. Wilson Buckley (Crack) * First Appearance: Glory in Death The owner and proprietor of a club known as the \\"Down and Dirty\\": it's an extremely dirty and grimy club, but illegal activity is somewhat low. His nickname comes from the sound that heads make when he rams them together. He becomes friends with Eve after initially mistaking her for a potential stripper. He is described as being very dark-skinned and large in stature, with a face that a mother would have trouble loving. He tends to favor a loincloth type dress, and silver clothing. After some initial meetings where she would pay him for information (in both Glory and Immortal), he occasionally helps her out by letting her have private meetings with other cops, informants, and Nadine Furst in his club's back rooms. He typically refers to her affectionately as \\"skinny white girl.\\" In Portrait in Death, his younger half-sister, a medical school student, is murdered; Eve takes him to the morgue to view her body, comforts him, and she and Roarke plant a tree for his sister in Central Park. After this, Crack says that she will never pay him for another favor again Origin in Death. Eve seems just as fond of him (often addressing him as 'Big Black Man' or 'Large Black Man') as he is of her, and invites him for Thanksgiving with her and Roarke. Eve's bachelorette party is at Crack's club in Immortal in Death. Wilson aka \\"Crack\\" has a much bigger part in Connections in Death where he is dating another central character (Rochelle Pickering), the sister of the first murder victim (Lyle Pickering). This gives Eve a new side of Crack to see and respect even calling him \\"smitten\\" with his new found love. Chief Harrison Tibble * First Appearance: Glory in Death The new Chief of Police in his first appearance, replacing Chief Simpson (who he referred to as a \\"corrupt, pie-faced fucker\\"), Tibble is a thirty-year veteran who rose through the ranks with Commander Whitney. A huge man, standing around 6\\"6' and weighing around 250lbs, he is well respected both by his officers and also by politicians and journalists. He implicitly trusts his contemporaries like Whitney and Feeney, and shares their opinion of Dallas. Eve respects and admires him, and also secretly admits to being a little afraid of him. Leonardo * First Appearance: Immortal in Death Leonardo is a famous clothing designer and Mavis's husband, marrying her in Born in Death shortly before she delivers their daughter, Bella Eve. He is an enormous man (6' 5\\" according to Immortal in Death), possesses Native American heritage, detests violence and is very peaceful. In Conspiracy in Death he is described as having the spirit of a seven-year-old boy on the first day of school. They currently live together in Eve's old apartment. He designed Eve's wedding dress; Eve is very fond of him and approves of him as a good match for Mavis. Trina * First Appearance: Immortal in Death Trina is a beauty technician introduced as a friend of Mavis's and Leonardo to assist with Eve's wedding preparations. She later promises Eve free consultations for the rest of her life when she clears Mavis of murder. The only consistent description of Trina is that she has impressive breasts, as much like Mavis she changes her appearance in almost every scene, never mind book. She appears to stand alongside Anna Whitney as one of the very few people Eve is scared of, as Trina considers Eve's hair to be \\"hers\\" once she's worked on it, and has more than once given Eve a temporary tattoo for cutting her own hair. Mavis and Peabody also take great delight in forcing Eve into treatments. Eve does accept that Trina always makes her look like herself, and has at times used her as an expert consultant with suspects who use disguises or enhancements. Trina's reputation is such that she works at high-profile fashion events, for Nadine Furst on her \\"Now\\" show and for Roarke at his high-end salon. Chief Tech Dickie Berenski * First Appearance: Immortal in Death Berenski, almost always referred to as \\"Dickhead\\" is the Chief Tech at the NYPSD's crime lab. He has an egg shaped head and thinning black hair as well as spider-like fingers. He is not above, and indeed often seems to expect, bribery in exchange for quick lab work. This, and his somewhat oily personality contribute to his unaffectionate nickname. Nonetheless he is highly respected for the quality of his work, and is fiercely loyal to his staff, a trait he shares with Eve. He appears, albeit briefly, in most books after his first appearance. James (Jamie) Lingstrom * First Appearance: Ceremony in Death Jamie shows up as the grandson and brother of one of the victims in the book; he's a teenager who attempts to break into Eve and Roarke's home in order to express to them his desire to find the truth about what happened to his family. His computer skills are such that he surprisingly passed over the highly secure perimeter and into the yard, though Roarke quickly catches him. Much to Roarke's annoyance, he sneaked over the garden wall with the help of a modified portable gaming system, one that Roarke in fact manufactures. He hero-worships both Eve and Roarke. In the end of Ceremony in Death, Jamie kills the murderer of his sister with an athame; Eve takes the blame and pretends she did it in order to spare him from a murder trial. In Purity in Death, Roarke brings him in as a technical assistant due to his very good computer and programming skills. He makes another appearance in Kindred in Death: he is now a university student who was good friends with one of the victims and offers Eve help where he can. Brian Kelly * First Appearance: Vengeance in Death Kelly is an old friend of Roarke's from his childhood and adolescence in Dublin. He and Roarke reconnect when Roarke returns to Ireland for the wake of one of the murder victims, and is now the owner of The Penny Pig, a pub that Roarke used to frequent. He still has connections with people that will no longer talk to Roarke now that he is married to a cop, and so is occasionally asked to unofficially assist with investigations. He is fond of embarrassing Roarke with stories from their past, and frequently tells Eve that he will be waiting for her when she comes to her senses and leaves Roarke. Officer (Detective) Troy Trueheart * First Appearance: Conspiracy in Death The most naive character in the series; like his name, he is a young, honest, innocent, and enthusiastic young officer (in Witness in Death he thanks Eve for giving him the mission of standing outside in the cold all night long). He has a single mother whom he loves very much, and who makes a brief appearance in Witness in Death when he is badly injured (by other police officers) while chasing a suspect. It is also mentioned in this book that he is twenty-two. In Purity in Death, Trueheart is taken under by Baxter, who agrees to train him at Eve's request. In this same book, Trueheart discharges his stunner, which turns out to be the final step in killing a victim under attack by the villains of the novel. Trueheart is kidnapped in Portrait in Death by the murderer: he manages to stay conscious enough to give Eve and Baxter directions to his location. Trueheart is well liked by virtually everyone‚Äîexcept the officer with whom he was working when he was introduced (Ellen Bowers, one of the murder victims in Conspiracy in Death). Trueheart takes and passes the Detective's test in Devoted in Death. The ceremony for the promotion is held in Brotherhood in Death. Dr. Louise Dimatto * First Appearance: Conspiracy in Death Louise is serving as a doctor in a clinic in the slums of Canal Street; she comes from a very rich family of important doctors, but rather than becoming an important doctor with a high salary, she works in the worst parts of NYC. Louise does have a trust that she lives on, and occasionally supplemented the clinic with her own cash. She is a witness of sorts in Seduction in Death to a body being tossed off a balcony. In addition, she serves as an informal consultant and informer to Eve in this book, Reunion in Death, Origin in Death, and others; Eve also prefers her treatment to that of other doctors, so she treated Eve's wounds in Reunion. Louise takes a large bribe from Eve for half a million to help her with the case. As Eve is not in possession of her badge at the time, the bribe is technically illegal. The half million is for Louise's clinic; Eve finds out in Seduction that Louise actually received three million, the other 2.5 being on condition that she contract her services to a women and children's abuse shelter, Dochas, founded by Roarke. Louise spends half her week there as of Portrait in Death. Lieutenant Donald Webster * First Appearance: Conspiracy in Death Webster is assigned to NYPSD Internal Affairs, and is one of Eve's former lovers. Although they only spent one night together, Webster never forgot about Eve, and retained a great deal of affection for her. This leads to an argument and fistfight with Roarke in Judgment in Death. Eve is baffled by Webster's feelings for her, and infuriated by both his and Roarke's actions. Later on Webster is seriously wounded protecting Eve, nearly dies, but recovers from his injuries. In the following books he appears to have come to terms with his feelings and is friendly with both Eve and Roarke. In Treachery in Death he happens to meet Chief Darcia Angelo, who is visiting from Roarke's off planet resort, Olympus. It is insinuated they intend to continue a relationship even after she returns home. Despite some antagonism towards Webster due to his leaving the streets for IAB (Referred to by regular cops as the Rat Squad), Eve has great respect for Webster and his abilities, and she knows that he values the job and badge over results. Chief Darcia Angelo * First Appearance: Interlude in Death Chief Angelo is the chief of police at the Olympus Resort, personally hired by Roarke. She and Eve butt heads several times over procedure and jurisdiction, but eventually come to an understanding. She visits New York in Treachery in Death where she meets Webster and begins a relationship with him. She was previously a police officer in Colombia focusing primarily on narcotics. She is described as being extremely attractive, with Peabody being somewhat jealous of her figure, and she greatly enjoys shopping whilst in New York as a change from police work. Dennis Mira * First Appearance: Reunion in Death Dennis Mira is the husband of Dr. Charlotte Mira. He seems to be a very absent-minded fellow, walking around with his shirt buttons mismatched. However, he is a very kind man; Eve is very fond of him and finds it easy to talk to him. He is very nonthreatening to her; however, he is intelligent, and as Charlotte says, very good at separating what is good and evil. Mira occasionally teaches at Colombia University. Eve sees him in Memory in Death, and before she knows what's happening, she breaks down weeping. She is mostly sad because she wonders what a difference it would have made to her tragic early life if she had had just one person like Dennis Mira who would have loved her like a parent. Eve likes him very much and in the same book, buys him a scarf. He believes Eve to be a very determined and good person with a necessary dark streak in her that he respects. Sinead Lanigan * First Appearance: Portrait in Death Sinead Lanigan is Roarke's Aunt, his late mother's twin sister. After receiving information from a social worker about his real mother he seeks out the truth and returns to Ireland to visit his mother's family. Roarke is shocked by the warmth of welcome he receives from Sinead. She is described as being small, with red hair and green eyes. She is very proud of the man Roarke has become and of the life he has made with Eve. Sinead and the whole family make sporadic appearances, particularly at Thanksgiving where it has become something of a tradition for them to visit Roarke and Eve in New York. Detective Vince Yancy * First Appearance: Portrait in Death Yancy is an Ident Artist working for the NYPSD. He is handsome and mild mannered, and is described by Dallas as the best imaging artist there is. He is adept at bonding with witnesses and drawing out all of the details that they can remember about a suspect, and will not allow Dallas or anyone else to rush his work when he knows a witness needs a break. Ursa Harvo * First Appearance: Visions in Death Harvo is a female tech at the crime lab, specialising in hair and fibre analysis, describing herself as the \\"Queen of Hair\\" and \\"Princess of Fibre\\" on meeting Dallas and Peabody. She has very white skin with spiked red hair and green eyes the colour of spring grass. She shares the general opinion of Dickhead that the other characters have, although admits that he is a brilliant tech. Her father works for the FBI in the same field of study as Harvo, and is considered one of the best in said field. Her combination of skill, efficiency and enthusiasm for her job, coupled with her smart mouth, make her one of Eve's go to people. In the book ‚ÄúThankless in Death,‚Äù she is called Harpo instead of Harvo. In Golden in Death she is revealed to be a 'killer' at poker by Jenkinson. APA Cher Reo * First Appearance: Origin in Death Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Cher Reo is introduced during the Icove case as Eve needs a warrant and needs an APA with the courage and belief in her to force it through. She is described as a petite and pretty woman, with soft curly blonde hair and baby blue eyes. She is short in stature, often wearing mile-high heels (according to Eve) and has a soft Southern accent. All of this is in contrast to her demeanour in court, where she is described as a piranha. She becomes Eve's \\"go-to\\" APA when she needs a warrant, and also becomes a close friend, being present at social events such as Mavis's baby shower. Detective Amaryllis Coltraine * First Appearance:: Origin in Death Coltraine is a Detective Third Grade who transfers to the NYPSD from Atlanta. A Southern belle with blue eyes and blonde hair and a curvy figure, she and Morris develop a mutual attraction and quickly begin dating. She is fond of baking to relax (particularly chocolate brownies) and although she is a smart and capable detective, she doesn't live the job the way Eve does. She is murdered in Promises in Death, devastating Morris who was falling in love with her. Her death causes Eve to admit to herself that she never really gave Coltraine a chance, subconsciously seeing her as an interloper due to her relationship with Morris, and causing Eve to take her death all the harder thinking that they would have been friends in due time. Detective Callendar * First Appearance: Creation in Death Callendar is another of Feeney's \\"boys\\" (all of Feeney's e-cops are his boys, regardless of gender) and is a friend of Peabody and McNab. She is introduced as part of the large taskforce working on the \\"Groom\\" serial killer case. Described by McNab as almost as good as he is, she has dark hair, burnt honey skin with sloe eyes and impressive breasts. In Promises in Death she is excited to be sent to the Omega Colony, her first off-planet assignment, to gather evidence against Max Ricker. Kyung Beaverton * First Appearance: Celebrity in Death Kyung is a media liaison attached to the NYPSD, often brought in on large cases by Chief Tibble. He is the only media liaison Eve can remotely stand, as he allows her to be herself and focus on the job, whereas other liaisons frequently focus on appearance and ask her to put on lip gloss before appearing on camera. Eve describes him to Roarke as 'not an asshole' which he recognises as a compliment by Eve's standards. Dr. Garnet DeWinter * First Appearance: Concealed in Death DeWinter is a forensic anthropologist, recently moved from Washington to New York and working with the NYPSD. Highly respected in her field, she forms a quick friendship with Morris as they share an interest in the dead through their work and both experienced failed relationships. DeWinter is divorced with a young daughter, and has a hot temper. She and Eve initially have a slightly frosty relationship, but have begun to respect each other's skills. Lieutenant Mitchell Lowenbaum * First Appearance: Delusion in Death Lowenbaum is head of the NYPSD's SWAT Team. He is attractive (as noted by Peabody), and admits that he once thought that he and Eve might get together before she met Roarke. In Apprentice in Death he is brought in by Eve as a consultant on the sniper case, and is devastated when it turns out to be a former colleague. Dawson * First Appearance: Concealed in Death Dawson is the head \\"sweeper\\", the colloquial name given to the Crime Scene Technicians working for the NYPSD. He, Morris and Eve have worked together on hundreds of cases and share the same focus and dedication to the job. Despite his profession, he has very poor eyesight. Jake Kincade * First Appearance: Apprentice in Death Kincade is the lead singer and guitarist of Avenue A, one of the most successful rock bands of their time. He is in a relationship with Nadine Furst, who he affectionately nicknames 'Lois'. Although a huge star in his own right, he is shown to be down to earth and a good man, helping other rock stars with substance abuse issues or spending time instructing at Roarke's shelter. Feeney is a huge fan of rock in general and Avenue A in particular, and is furious with Eve for not introducing them, until she makes amends by getting him an invite to a rehearsal session. Eve's squad Other than Baxter, and Trueheart when they start working together, little is mentioned about Eve's squad in any great detail through the early books. Occasionally members of the squad will ask for Eve's opinion on a case or be pulled in as part of the team on larger cases. As of Treachery in Death where the focus is on another police lieutenant suspected of corruption, Eve's squad consists of: Detective Jenkinson. Referred to as \\"Sick Bastard\\" much as Baxter is referred to as \\"Horny Dog\\", Jenkinson is a solid veteran who is fiercely loyal to Dallas. He is fond of wearing garish ties to brighten his day and that of his squadmates. In Golden in Death he and Reineke are shown to play poker regularly, with Feeney, Callendar and Harvo the other listed players. Detective Reineke is Jenkinson's partner, also fiercely loyal to Dallas and fond of garish socks rather than ties Detective Carmichael is a female detective, somewhat hot tempered and apparently not someone you should make bets with as she almost always wins. She is dark-haired and pretty, and acquires a pair of jewelled cowboy boots when on assignment in Texas. She is also a talented singer, and enjoys jamming with Morris, Santiago, Mavis and Jake Kincade at Nadine's housewarming party in Connections in Death. She is first mentioned in Immortal in Death as having made a mistake in not IDing a Jane Doe who connects to one of Dallas's cases. Detective Santiago is the new guy, a calming influence on his partner Carmichael. He went to college and played baseball to a high standard but joined the NYPSD as that was what he always wanted, whereas baseball was \\"just playing\\" to him, although he thinks about joining a softball team with some of Roarke's employees. He is also a talented pianist as shown in Connections in Death. He may be named Sanchez in some books. Officer Carmichael is the longest serving uniformed officer in Eve's squad. He is a solid veteran, described as being hell on details. Other uniformed officers who cross Eve's path and impress her are often added to her squad later, beginning with Peabody and Trueheart, then later on Officer Newkirk (introduced in Creation In Death and the son of an officer on the original case) and Officer Shelby (introduced in Festive In Death and brought in to Eve's squad when Trueheart makes Detective). Shelby is shown to have a very active social life as Eve often meets witnesses who know her, and states that she has no ambition to make detective as she loves the uniform. All respect and admire Dallas, and fear her wrath if they don't do the job to her high standards. They are also fiercely loyal to her, and cite facts such as her small and dingy office to other squads as proof of how she cares about her men and the job more than rank and appearances. Nonappearing characters These characters are for the most part deceased, but play an important role by figuring strongly into the minds of Eve and Roarke and may frequently show up in flashbacks or memories. Richard Troy * First Appearance: Naked in Death Richard Troy is Eve's biological father; from when she was about five or six, he began raping her, continuing until the night of his death when Eve was eight years old. Eve kills him with a kitchen knife while he is drunkenly raping her, in Dallas, Texas, but he breaks her arm during the process. He is present in every single book, as he is always the spectre of Eve's nightmares. Typically, he appears in her nightmares to tell her that no matter how many people she finds justice for, there will always be more monsters like him, waiting to do more evil to innocents like the little girl she was. His first name is revealed in Judgment in Death; his last name is found by Roarke in his file on Homeland Security Organization's files in Divided in Death. He was working as a kind of informer for HSO, despite the fact that he was a criminal with a minor child, Eve (at eight years old). Richard Troy was raising Eve - who is definitely his biological child - with the intent of using her for child prostitution. Mira concludes and tells Eve in Reunion in Death that Troy was probably not a pedophile himself, but preferred adult women, something that Eve does vaguely remember. In Interlude in Death, Roarke realizes that his father, Patrick Roarke, had business in Dallas, Texas, with Troy, the same week of Troy's death. This business is fully realized in Divided in Death: Eve remembers her father telling her in Reunion that she was finally going to start working (or rather, being raped for her father's profit). That Patrick Roarke was there, with cash, on his own business, indicates that Troy was going to sell Eve to Patrick Roarke. For the record, HSO was perfectly aware that Eve murdered Troy, but cleaned up the body and had the case unsolved, as they had themselves recommended she not be taken out of Troy's custody. Troy also had business dealings with Max Ricker, the villain of Judgement in Death, and stole money from him. Ricker knew he had a daughter, but over twenty years later, does not make the connection between Troy and Eve. Troy was under surveillance by the HSO the day he died. He was recorded as having returned to his hotel room at 2:00 a.m. in the morning; in Eve's memories, he begins beating and raping her immediately after his return, during which she kills him. Therefore, his time and date of death is shortly after 2:00 a.m., May 13, 2036.Divided in Death, chapter 7. Patrick Roarke * First Appearance: has only been discussed, starting in Naked in Death The father of Roarke. Patrick Roarke was a criminal who had the Irish police in his pocket, as he wielded some minor power. He came to the US in 2036 to ruin Max Ricker's gun-running operation in Atlanta, a situation in which he double-crossed Max Ricker and the police officers, who were paying him to be an informant. Siobhan Brody ran away from him with their son when Roarke was a baby; upon her return, Patrick Roarke killed her and threw her in the river with the assistance of some friends. He then raised Roarke by having him steal throughout the day and bring back money to him. With the information that Eve's father was going to start selling her in Dallas, it is to be concluded that Richard Troy was going to sell his daughter to Patrick Roarke. Roarke believes Patrick Roarke died in 2035 (when he was twelve), but Patrick Roarke actually died sometime in Ireland, 2036, at Summerset's hands.Divided in Death Patrick Roarke leaves an uneasy legacy behind for Roarke with the experiences of a policeman named Skinner, who held Patrick (appropriately so) responsible for the death of thirteen police officers in an attempt to arrest Max Ricker. Decades later, Skinner has transferred the grudge to Roarke in Interlude in Death. Sheila Feeney * First Appearance: discussed as of Naked in Death Sheila is Captain Feeney's wife. She never has any dialog but is often mentioned. Eve appears to be a little afraid of her, but also says she is the best cop's wife she knows of due to her loyalty and lack of complaining about the hours. Feeney often refers to her as \\"the wife\\" in front of other cops, but loves her dearly. It is mentioned that she enjoys celebrity gossip, pottery, knitting and also loves getting dressed up for big social events such as Eve and Roarke's annual Christmas party. Siobhan Brody * First Appearance: Portrait in Death The biological mother of Roarke and twin sister of Sinead Lannigan, Siobhan originally was from County Clare, part of a farming family. She came to Dublin at eighteen, hoping for the excitement of a city life. She met and was charmed by Patrick Roarke (see above), and bore his child out of wedlock. He abused her, but she repeatedly asked him to marry her, and in her social worker's words, give Roarke a true father. She eventually ran away from Patrick and took her son with her to a shelter, but went back, believing she shouldn't take her son away from his father. Subsequently, Patrick Roarke beat her to death and threw her in the River Liffey. Patrick Roarke's real wife, Meg Roarke, then raised Roarke (abusively) until he was about five, whereupon she left. Roarke resembles his father almost identically, but Siobhan's twin tells Roarke that he has inherited the shape of his eyes from his mother. Stella * First Appearance: Loyalty in Death; named in Imitation in Death Stella is Eve's biological mother; the evidence for this is that Eve remembers seeing her own eyes reflected in her mother's face in a flashback in Imitation. Eve's mother was a prostitute and a drug addict; in addition, she was abusive. In the flashback, she finds Eve trying on her wigs and reacts badly, grabbing Eve by the hair and beating her.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 873. A small blue-collar community, Mount Savage lies at the base of Big Savage Mountain in the Allegheny Mountains, between the cities of Frostburg and Cumberland. It began as a small farming settlement in the mid-19th century, but it was not until 1844 that the region was put on the nation's map with the pressing of the first iron rail in the United States. After this claim to fame, Mount Savage became the fifth largest city in Maryland. Named as the headquarters for the Mount Savage Railroad and later the Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad (C&P;), the area was deemed an industrial center. In addition to the rail businesses, Mount Savage attracted a foundry, two brick refractories, and several local merchants. In this company town, the industries shaped the economy and topography of Mount Savage, building housing for workers and donating land for schools, churches, and other public buildings. It was a cultural melting pot attracting English businessmen and Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Italian, and German workers. With this diverse mix of cultures, the identity of Mount Savage was molded into a close- knit community. Despite the loss of the industries to the region, Mount Savage continues to celebrate its hard-working traditions. The Mount Savage Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Early history The name origin of Mount Savage is derived from a land surveyor, Thomas Savage, who happened to be traveling through the area in 1736. The Archibald Arnold family later settled \\"Arnold's Settlement\\", now Mount Savage, around 1774.The United States Catholic Magazine and Monthly Review, January 1844 The town is the oldest in Allegany County to have a group of the same family to pioneer a town.Anonymous. \\"Arnold's Settlement.\\" Heritage Press. Vol. 1, No. 8 (1972), p. 1. The Arnolds were Catholic farmers originating from southern Maryland.Charles Carney. \\"The History of Mount Savage.\\" University of Maryland, May 1967. The Arnold family settled northeast of the current town, along a Native American trail which was later known as \\"Turkey Foot Road\\". The Arnolds established a hotel, \\"Arnold's Hotel\\", which welcomed the pioneers who were heading out west towards the Ohio River Valley. They also had a self-sustaining farm which became part of the present-day Glen Savage Dairy Farm. The site of the hotel is along an 1804 alteration to the Turkey Foot Road.L. Dietle & M. McKenzie. \\"In Search of the Turkey Foot Road.\\" Mount Savage Historical Society, 2010. The Arnold family eventually owned most of the land of the present-day Mount Savage, Archibald sometimes purchasing at a time. Some areas of land that Arnold purchased were documented only as \\"Move About\\", \\"Tomahawk\\" and \\"Durbin's Neglect\\". In the early 19th century Mount Savage was primarily a self-sufficient farming community with no real need to embark onto enterprises with neighboring towns or industries. Mount Savage was the only town west of Cumberland with a Catholic church, so many families from neighboring states and towns traveled there for Mass. Upon completion of the National Road, settlers headed west by the thousands, flooding the Cumberland- Mount Savage area and calling attention to Mount Savage's mineral wealth. Industrial history The Maryland and New York Iron and Coal Company was incorporated in 1837. This important company was established by an Englishman, Benjamin Howell, who was one of the many travelers along the National Road. The company built the Mount Savage Iron Works, which utilized the iron ore that was abundant in the Mount Savage area. Following the construction of blast furnaces in 1839, the company built the Mount Savage Railroad in 1844 to connect the town to Cumberland and with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;). The company produced about 200 tons of iron a week in 1845. The Mount Savage works was the only company in America to manufacture heavy railroad iron at that time. With the flourishing industry upon Mount Savage, clay, brick, coal and locomotives were also being manufactured and transported to neighboring towns and states by way of the new railroad system. The most prosperous coal mines were the Eckhart Mines, located southwest of Mount Savage, which produced bituminous coal. The Mount Savage railroad system became the main supplier to the B&O; as well as the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. By 1852 the iron works was considered to be the largest in the United States. By 1864, the Union Mining Company was established in Allegany County. This company controlled most of the clay and brick exports. Little Mount Savage had officially grown into a legendary, American industrial center. The iron works faced competition from facilities in Pennsylvania and the Great Lakes region. The company's rolling mill was shut down in 1868 and the blast furnaces ceased operation c. 1870.Allen, Jay D. (1970). \\"The Mount Savage Iron Works, Mount Savage, Maryland: A Case Study in Pre-Civil War Industrial Development.\\" Graduate thesis, University of Maryland, College Park. The brick works continued to operate successfully and became the principal industry in the town through the late 20th century. The C&P; Railroad acquired the Mount Savage Railroad in 1854, and built shops to manufacture locomotives and other rolling stock in Mount Savage in 1866. The railroad operated through the mid-20th century. Demographics As of the 2010 census, there were 873 people in 338 households living within the boundaries of Mount Savage. 236 of those were family households. The racial makeup of Mount Savage was 96.4% White, 0.6% African American, 0.1% Asian, 1.3% some other race, and 1.6% two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.6% of the population.

It is situated against a cliff in a section of the road between Geneva and the Simplon Pass (to northern Italy).1826 painting of the pass and bridge by Richard Parkes Bonington, (website accessed September 27, 2006). The abbey itself is a territorial abbacy and not part of any diocese. It is best known for its connection to the martyrdom of the Theban Legion, its original practice of perpetual psalmody, and a collection of art and antiquity. The abbey is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The abbey of St. Maurice is built on the ruins of a Roman shrine of the 1st century B.C. dedicated to the god Mercury in the Roman staging-post of Agaunum, and first came to prominence as a result of a now disputed account by Eucherius, the Bishop of Lyon. He had experienced a revelation that convinced him of the martyrdom of a Roman legion‚Äîknown as the Theban Legion‚Äîunder the command of Saint Maurice, around 285 A.D., in the area where the abbey is located. In 515, the Basilica of St. Maurice of Agaunum became the church of a monastery under the patronage of King Sigismund of Burgundy, the first ruler in his dynasty to convert from Arian Christianity to Trinitarian Christianity. The abbey became known for a form of perpetual psalmody known as laus perennis that was practised there beginning in 522 or 523. The chants were sung day and night, by several choirs in rotation without ceasing. The practice continued there until the 9th century, when the monks were replaced by a community of canons. The abbey had some of the richest and best preserved treasures in Western Europe, such as the Ewer of Saint-Maurice d'Agaune. In the mid-9th century, Hucbert, brother-in-law of the Emperor Lothair II, seized the abbey. In 864 he was killed in a battle at the Orbe River and was replaced by the victor, Count Conrad of Auxerre, who later became the commendatory abbot of the abbey. Boso, later King of Provence, (850-887) received the abbey around 870 from his brother-in-law, Charles the Bald. Conrad's son, Rudolph I of Burgundy, who had inherited the commendatory abbacy from him, succeeded Boson as king and was crowned in 888 in a ceremony at the abbey itself, which he then made the royal residence. The offspring of Conrad of Auxerre became the Kings of Burgundy, in a line running from Rudolf I to Rudolf III. They directed the abbey until around the year 1000. The monastery remained the property of the Kingdom of Burgundy until 1033, when, through the defeat in battle of Eudes, a nephew of Rudolf III, it passed to the control of the House of Savoy. Amadeus III, Count of Savoy, became the commendatory abbot of the monastery in 1103 and worked to revive religious observance at the abbey by installing there, in 1128, the community of canons regular, who still live there under the Rule of St. Augustine, in place of the secular canons. Throughout the history of the abbey, its strategic mountain pass location and independent patronage has subjected it to the whims of war. The abbey was often forced to pay ransom or house troops. In 1840, Pope Gregory XVI conferred the title of the See of Bethlehem in perpetuity on the abbey.. Today the abbey consists of some 40 canons, with 2 lay brothers. The Most Rev. Abbot Joseph Roduit, C.R.A., who was elected in 1999, resigned with the permission of Pope Francis on Wednesday, 18 March 2015, so the abbatial office is vacant. The canonical community serves both the spiritual needs of the territory of the abbey nullius as well as five parishes in the Diocese of Sion. The canons also operate a highly ranked secondary school. Architecture View of the cloister. The abbey has been built and rebuilt over a period of at least 15 centuries. Excavations on the site have revealed a baptistry dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, a series of four main Carolingian era churches built over one another dating from the 5th to the 11th century, and crypts built between the 4th and 8th century. The current church was first built in the 17th century while the tower dates to the 11th century. Preceding Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral in 946, Chartres Cathedral ca. 1020 and Rouen Cathedral ca. 1030, the abbey was an early example of an ambulatory plan with radiating chapels. The Romanesque tower was reconstructed in 1945 to repair damage caused by a massive falling rock. The newly installed carillon is the largest built to date in Switzerland.

The term of the appointment is seven years.\\"Jeremy Rudin to replace Julie Dickson as head of OSFI\\", by Tara Perkins and Kevin Carmichael, Globe and Mail, June 13, 2014  Mandate  The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) was created to contribute to public confidence in the Canadian financial system. OSFI's role is to: * Supervise institutions and pension plans to determine whether they are in sound financial condition and meeting minimum plan funding requirements respectively, and are complying with their governing law and supervisory requirements; * Promptly advise institutions and plans in the event there are material deficiencies and take or require management, boards or plan administrators to take necessary corrective measures expeditiously; * Advance and administer a regulatory framework that promotes the adoption of policies and procedures designed to control and manage risk; * Monitor and evaluate system-wide or sectoral issues that may impact institutions negatively. OSFI‚Äôs legislation has due regard to the need to allow institutions to compete effectively and take reasonable risks. The legislation also recognizes that management, boards of directors and plan administrators are ultimately responsible and that financial institutions and pension plans can fail. The Office of the Chief Actuary, an independent unit operating within OSFI, provides a range of actuarial valuation and advisory services to the Government of Canada.http://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/oca-bac/Pages/default.aspx  Related legislation  * Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act * Bank Act * Trust and Loan Companies Act * Cooperative Credit Associations Act * Insurance Companies Act * Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 (PBSA)  History  Late 1800s ‚Äì establishment of the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance (OSI), which subsequently became the Department of Insurance (DOI). The DOI was responsible for overseeing federally licensed life insurance companies, property and casualty insurance companies, trust and loan companies and pension plans, and for providing actuarial services to the government. 1925 ‚Äì the Office of the Inspector General of Banks was established in response to the Home Bank failure and was responsible for regulating Canada's chartered banks. Early 1930s ‚Äì Royal Commission on Banking and Currency reviewed banking and currency issues in the Canadian financial system. Early 1960s ‚Äì Porter Royal Commission reviewed structural and operational issues affecting the financial system and financial institutions in Canada. The Commission's report concluded the financial system was sound, but developments had moved beyond the current state of laws and regulatory practices. Porter argued the public could not be insulated from loss in dealing with public institutions and markets. The Commission called for a system that would provide for adequate disclosure and that would set high standards of self-regulation, backed by strong government supervision and powers to enforce proper practices. 1967 ‚Äì the Minister of Finance introduced legislation to establish the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) to ensure the safety of small deposits and bring about a gradual improvement in the minimum financial standard of deposit-taking institutions in Canada. In 1983, legislative amendments extended CDIC's mandate to include assisting to maintain public confidence and stability in the financial system. Mid-1980s ‚Äì increased international competition and the failure of two Canadian banks and the subsequent enquiry into these failures by the Honourable Willard Z. Estey highlighted the need to ensure a sound approach to handling the risks associated with the financial marketplace. July 1987 ‚Äì to ensure a coordinated approach to supervision and a modern regulatory framework for Canada's financial system, and acting on the recommendations of the Estey commission, the government proclaimed the Financial Institutions and Deposit Insurance Amendment Act and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act. This latter Act joined the Department of Insurance and the Office of the Inspector General of Banks to form OSFI, which was given the powers to supervise and regulate all federally regulated financial institutions. May 1996 ‚Äì Bill C-15 receives Royal Assent. This new legislation clarifies OSFI's prime responsibilities as helping to minimize losses to depositors, policy holders, and pension plan members and to maintain public confidence in the Canadian financial system. Preventing failure of financial institutions is not part of OSFI's mandate; however, promoting sound business practices helps reduce the risk that financial institutions will fail. The mandate stresses the importance of early intervention to achieve OSFI's objectives and establishes the basis for OSFI's mission, objectives, priorities and strategies.

Internal erosion occurs when the hydraulic forces exerted by water seeping through the pores and cracks of the material in the dam and/or foundation are sufficient to detach particles and transport them out of the dam structure. Internal erosion is especially dangerous because there may be no external evidence, or only subtle evidence, that it is taking place. Usually a sand boil can be found, but the boil might be hidden under water. A dam may breach within a few hours after evidence of internal erosion becomes obvious. Piping is a related phenomenon and is defined as the progressive development of internal erosion by seepage, appearing downstream as a hole discharging water.ICOLD GIGB, ICOLD Dictionary Piping is induced by regressive erosion of particles from downstream and along the upstream line towards an outside environment until a continuous pipe is formed.Development of piping erosion conditions in the Benson area, Arizona, U.S.A.The scaling law of piping erosion Internal erosion and the piping process According to the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD), there are four general failure modes for internal erosion of embankment dams and their foundations: * Through the embankment * Through the foundation * Embankment-into-foundation * Associated with through-penetrating structures The process of internal erosion occurs across four phases: initiation of erosion, progression to form a pipe, surface instability, and, lastly, initiation of a breach. Internal erosion is also classified in four types, dependent on failure path, how the erosion initiates and progresses, and its location: * Concentrated leak: seeping water erodes and enlarges a crack until a breach occurs. The crack may not progress to the exit (albeit failure is still possible), but eventually the continued erosion forms a pipe or a sinkhole. * Backward erosion: initiated at the exit point of the seepage path, this type of erosion occurs when the hydraulic gradient is sufficiently high to cause particle detachment and transport; a pipe forms backwards from the exit point until breach. * Suffusion: occurs in soils with a wide range of particle sizes. Finer soil particles are eroded through the voids between coarser particles. Soils susceptible to suffusion are termed internally unstable. Suffusion can only occur if the volume occupied by the finer particles is lower than the available void space between the coarse particles. * Soil contact erosion: a phenomenon called sheet flow occurs at interfaces between coarse and fine soils. Water seeps along the interface between the two soils, eroding the particles from the finer layer into the coarser layer. Concentrated leak Concentrated leaks occur when cracks form in the soil. The cracks must be below reservoir level, and water pressure needs to be present to maintain the open pipe. It is possible for water flow to cause the sides of the pipe to swell, closing it and thus limiting erosion. Additionally, if the soil lacks sufficient cohesion to maintain a crack, the crack will collapse and concentrated leak erosion will not progress to a breach. Cracks that allow concentrated leaks can arise due to many factors, including: * Cross-valley arching resulting in vertical stresses on the sides of the dam * Core arching on the shoulders of the embankment * Differential settlement (above 0.2% differential, a crack forming is almost certain) * Small scale irregularities during core treatment (e.g. due to poor compaction) * Cracks and gaps adjacent to spillways or abutment walls or around conduits * Various environmental factors like desiccation, settlement during earthquakes, freezing, animal burrows, vegetation/roots. Longitudinal cracks arise from the spreading of the embankment, while transverse openings, which are much more common, are due to vertical settlement of the dam. The hydraulic shear stress œÑc required for the initiation of concentrated leak erosion can be estimated using laboratory testing, such as the hole erosion test (HET). Backward erosion This hanging valley has been created by the rapid backward erosion of the boulder clay cliffs. Backward erosion often occurs in non-plastic soils such as fine sands. It can occur in sandy foundations, within the dam or levee, or in cofferdams under high flood pressures during construction, causing unravelling at the downstream face. Backward erosion is most often exhibited by the presence of sand boils at the downstream side of dams. Experiments from Sellmeijer and co-workers have shown that backwards erosion initiates in a slot through the strata that overlays the eroding soil (e.g. through excavations or drainage ditches) and then progress in many, smaller pipes (less than 2mm in height) rather than a single one. The stability of the pipes is dependent on the head, and once this is larger than a critical value (0.3-0.5 of flow path length), the channel extends upstream. Beyond this, at any head greater than the critical value, erosion progresses until eventually the pipes break through to the upstream reservoir, at which point breach occurs. In order for backwards erosion to occur, the dam or levee body must form and maintain a ‚Äòroof‚Äô for the pipe. Suffusion Suffusion occurs when water flows through widely-graded or gap-graded, cohesionless soils. The finer particles are transported by seepage, and the coarse particles carry most of the effective stress. Suffusion can only occur provided the fine soil particles are small enough to pass between the coarse particles and do not fill the voids in the coarser soil. Water flow velocity must also be sufficient to transport those fine particles. Suffusion leads to increased permeability in the embankment core, greater seepage velocities and possibly hydraulic fractures. It can also lead to settlement if it occurs in the dam foundation. Soils subject to suffusion also tend to be affected by segregation. The Kenney-Lau approach is a renowned method for the analysis of suffusion, which uses the particle size distribution to assess the internal stability of a soil, which directly affects the likelihood of suffusion occurring. Soil contact erosion Soil contact erosion occurs when sheet flow (water flow parallel to an interface) erodes fine soil in contact with coarse soil. Contact erosion is largely dependent on the flow velocity, which must be sufficient to detach and transport the finer particles, as well as the finer soil particles being able to pass through the pores in the coarse layer. When contact erosion is initiated, a cavity is formed, leading to a reduction of stress. The roof of the cavity then collapses; the collapsed material is transported away resulting in a larger cavity. The process continues until the formation of a sinkhole. It is possible for a cavity to not collapse; this will lead to backward erosion occurring. Soil contact erosion can occur between any granular layer and a finer soil such as in silt-gravel, and often results in a loss of stability, increases in pore pressure and clogging of the permeable layer. Experimental results show that close to the geometrical limit, the point at which the fine particles can just pass between the coarse particles(the filter criterion), erosion initiation and failure are much more likely. Prevention using filters It is possible to interrupt the process of internal erosion with the use of filters. Filters trap eroded particles while still allowing seepage, and are normally coarser and more permeable than the filtered soil. The type of filter required and its location is dependent on which zones of the dam are most susceptible to internal erosion. Per regulation, filters need to satisfy five conditions: * Retention: the filter must limit or interrupt the transport of eroded soil particles. * Self- filtration: also defined as stability, the filter must be internally stable. * No cohesion: the filter must not have the ability to maintain cracks or the ability to cement. * Drainage: the filter must be sufficiently permeable to allow water pressure to dissipate. * Strength: the filter must be capable of transferring stresses within the dam without being crushed.

The series follows a government task force assigned to investigate chemical and biological threats. Initially, the program focused on the virologist Edward Marcase (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Dr. Kimberly Shiroma (Tamlyn Tomita). In response to the show's low ratings, Marcase and Shiroma were removed in the middle of the season. Dr. Daniel Cassian (Michael Harris) became the lead character, and a new character, Dr. Brian Taft (Bradford Tatum), joined the task force. The Burning Zone initially incorporated supernatural and religious elements, but shifted towards more action-oriented storylines. The series was only drama ordered by UPN for the 1996‚Äì97 television season. It was paired with the sitcoms Moesha and Homeboys in Outer Space. The Burning Zone has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. Critical response to The Burning Zone was primarily negative; commentators were divided over its storylines and tone. It received comparisons to other science-fiction properties, especially The X-Files. Kasumi Mihori and Billy Pittard were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design for the 49th Primetime Emmy Awards for their contributions to the series.  Premise and characters  The main characters of the series from left to right: Michael Hailey, Dr. Kimberly Shiroma, Dr. Daniel Cassian, and Edward Marcase. The Burning Zone is a science-fiction drama about a task force that investigates biochemical emergencies. Funded by the United States government, the team includes a virologist, a geneticist, a security specialist, and a bureaucrat. Set during a global rise in lethal diseases, known as the Plague Wars, the show includes hard science storylines resolved through spiritual solutions, including the efficacy of prayer and the power of a \\"healthy soul\\". When discussing the show's premise, critics had varying opinions on its inspiration. Comparisons were drawn to television films, B movies, and news headlines, and the Chicago Tribune's Allan Johnson summed up The Burning Zone as a \\"mutant-disease-of-the-week series\\". The task force includes virologist Edward Marcase (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who survived a case of Ebola virus disease as a child, although his parents died from the virus. Devoting his life to researching the virus, he approaches the process of handling and curing a diseases as a \\"mystical experience\\" or a \\"supernatural quest\\". Johnson likened Marcase to Fox Mulder, a fictional character from The X-Files, due to his \\"almost mystical relationship with diseases\\". Caryn James of The New York Times wrote that Morgan played Marcase with \\"a brooding style\\". Marcase works closely with Dr. Kimberly Shiroma (Tamlyn Tomita), who specialized in molecular genetics and pathology during her time at the World Health Organization. She blames Marcase for her fianc√©'s death. James compared Marcase's relationship with Shiroma to that between The X-Files Mulder and Dana Scully. The team's other members include Michael Hailey (James Black) and Dr. Daniel Cassian (Michael Harris). Hailey handles the task force's security, while using his previous work experience with the Central Intelligence Agency. The group's leader Cassian is portrayed as a \\"no- nonsense doctor\\" with a high security clearance and a \\"firm grip over his emotions\\". In response to the show's low ratings, United Paramount Network (UPN) removed Marcase and Shiroma with \\"only the briefest of explanations\\".Muir (2001): p. 456 Cassain subsequently became the lead character, despite previously being portrayed as \\"a kind of Dr. Smith-like thorn in the side\\". Critic John Kenneth Muir referred to the casting changes as \\"a behind-the-scenes massacre\\". Dr. Brian Taft (Bradford Tatum) was added to the show after Marcase and Shiroma's exit. Muir described Taft as \\"a motorcycle-riding, rebellious James Dean-like physician\\". Storylines shifted away from supernatural cases to include more action. Science fiction writers Roger Fulton and John Gregory Betancourt wrote that the program had \\"so many transformations in its brief 19-episode run that no viewer who saw the first show would recognize the last\\". Morgan and Tomita appear in 11 episodes while Todd Susman was in two episodes. Black appears in all 19 episodes, and Harris and Tatum are in 18 episodes and eight episodes, respectively.  Production and broadcast history  Produced by Universal Television, The Burning Zone was created by Coleman Luck, who was an executive producer alongside James Duff McAdams and Carleton Eastlake. Consultation for the episodes was provided by an infectious-disease expert, Dr. Kimberly A. Shriner. One of six shows ordered by UPN, The Burning Zone was the network's only new drama for the 1996‚Äì97 television season. It was the final program announced as a part of UPN's 1996-97 line-up. John Kenneth Muir cited The Burning Zone as an example of how the mid-1990s was \\"the great era of 'virus'-centric pop-culture entertainment\\". According to John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle, The Burning Zone was one of the eight shows ordered for the 1996‚Äì97 television season that could be \\"classified as science fiction or at least very strange\\". Critics frequently compared the series to The X-Files.Owen (1999): p. 204 In the 1999 book Gen X TV: The Brady Bunch to Melrose Place, journalist Rob Owen described The Burning Zone as part of a 1996 trend of \\"X-Files rejects\\" that included Dark Skies and Millennium. The show also received comparisons to the 1995 film Outbreak and the 1971 film The Andromeda Strain.Raw (2009): p. 18 The Burning Zone was broadcast on Tuesday nights at 9 pm EST, airing with the sitcoms Moesha and Homeboys in Outer Space. UPN included references to The X-Files in the promotional materials for the show. In a University of California, Los Angeles report, senior fellow Harlan Lebo wrote that The Burning Zone is one of two shows, along with The Sentinel, in the 1996‚Äì97 television season that received complaints for its use of violence. The network canceled The Burning Zone, and rescheduled Tuesday nights with four additional sitcoms, including Clueless. In 2012, Muir called for the show's release on home media, along with Sleepwalkers and Prey, but it has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or licensed to an online streaming service.  Episodes  Critical reception  The critical response was primarily negative. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly called the show \\"stiff, pretentious blarney\\" and an \\"unhealthy hugger-mugger\\", and cited its dialogue as one of its weaknesses. Bret Watson, writing for the same publication, dismissed The Burning Zone as \\"sci-fi schlock-fest\\". During a negative review of the special effects, Caryn James wrote that the \\"supposedly new microbe- imaging system look[ed] like the inside of a multicolored lava lamp\\". Scott D. Pierce panned the show's storylines for going \\"into the realm of ridiculous fantasy\\", and negatively compared the characters and dialogue to those of a soap opera. Allan Johnson criticized The Burning Zone as a poor replacement for UPN's previous series Nowhere Man, and requested that the network cancel The Burning Zone to revive Nowhere Man. In his review of the pilot, Johnson criticized Morgan's beard for making him appear \\"like he spent more time at college kegger parties than studying germs\\". John Kenneth Muir called The Burning Zone \\"a one-season blunder\\".Muir (2002): p. 170 Some critics had more positive remarks for The Burning Zone. Kasumi Mihori and Billy Pittard received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design for the 49th Primetime Emmy Awards for their work on the show's main title. James Endrst praised the production, though he had a more mixed response for the show's \\"B-level stars and performances\\". Caryn James praised the episodes for containing \\"the loopy delights of a cut-rate, over-the-top horror movie\\", but questioned their intended tone due to the actors' serious portrayals of their characters. James felt that the show should have embraced \\"its silliest, campiest instincts\\".

In Europe In 1892, Reb Shlomo was born in Paritsh, Minsk in Belarus. His father was Rabbi Michel Heiman. When he was 12 years old, he went to the yeshiva of Kaminetz to study under R' Baruch Ber Lebowitz, with whom he was very close. In 1918, he married the daughter of Rabbi Yochanon Rudensky of Volozhin (the brother-in-law of R' Simcha Zelig Riger of Brisk, who served as the dayan for the Brisker Rav). After his marriage, Reb Baruch Ber asked Reb Shlomo to be a lecturer in the Kaminetz yeshiva, Beis Yitzchok, which was wandering from Slobodka to Krementchug. It was at this time that Reb Shlomo developed a reputation of being one of Lithuania's most outstanding Talmudists. During World War I, Reb Shlomo was briefly drafted into the Russian army for a some time. He served on the front lines of the war, yet still managed to review the entire tractate of Ketubot (Talmud) in the trenches. After the First World War, Reb Shlomo began to deliver his Talmudic lectures in Ohel Torah of Baranowitz, under the leadership of Rabbi Elchanan Wasserman. In 1927, at the request of Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzensky of Vilna, Reb Shlomo became the Rosh Yeshiva of the Ramailles Yeshiva, a position he held until 1935. In America In 1935, Reb Shlomo was invited by Reb Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz to lead Mesivta Torah Vodaath in the United States of America. With the approval of Reb Chaim Ozer, Reb Shlomo accepted this position, and therefore was spared the horrors of the Holocaust. Reb Shlomo died at the relatively young age of 52 in 1945. In America Reb Shlomo faced ardent secularism, which threatened to smother any vestige of the haredi way of life. He once remarked that one whose own children do not pursue the path of Torah can compensate by teaching Torah to the children of others.Parshat Bamidbar 5763 - OU Torah Insights Project at www.ou.org Despite the prevailing irreligious atmosphere, during the years of Reb Shlomo's tenure at Torah Vodaath, \\"the yeshivah entered a period of significant growth and expansion\\".Jewish Professionals Institute (JPI) - Holocaust Thesis Chapter 6 at www.jpi.org He was succeeded in the Ramailles yeshiva by Rabbi Yisroel Zev Gustman and in Torah Vodaath by Rabbi Reuven Grozovsky. Works A two-volume compendium of Reb Shlomo's Talmudic novellae, Chiddushei Rabbi Shlomo, was printed after his death (in 1966), based on Heiman's writings as well as notes of his students. It was released by Rav Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz, one of Rav Shlomo's greatest students. It is widely used in many yeshivos, and is considered a basic text among late acharonim. A later book, Shiurei Rabbi Shlomo ('The Lectures of Rabbi Shlomo), printed from the notes of Heiman's students, contains many lectures and novellae not published in Chidushei Rabbi Shlomo. A collection of some of Heiman's original thoughts on the Bible, as well as a few of his ethical discourses has also been published.

Born in Samokov to the family of Hristo Dimitrov, the founder of the Samokov iconographic school, Dimitar was the elder brother of the better-known painter Zahari Zograf. Dimitar was taught iconography by his father in his workshop and by his father's death in 1819 he was already an accomplished painter, taking the leadership of his father's workshop and often working for the same monasteries and architects as his father. Dimitar educated his younger brother and practically assumed the role of a father for Zahari until about 1830. In 1831, a note evidences that the two brothers worked as almost equal. In 1822 Dimitar Zograf married Hristiyaniya and had seven children, four of whom also became icon painters. The best known of them is Stanislav Dospevski. Unlike his brother Zahari, Dimitar did not sign his works, but they are not difficult to identify because of their unrivalled quality in the period.

It was first manufactured in 1965 (but introduced as a 1966 model) and was produced until the end of the 1968 model year. Production peaked at more than 5000 units per month. It was superseded by an updated version which was designated the T250-1. An X6 is owned by comedian Jay Leno, and one segment of his web program called Jay Leno's Garage features his profile of the motorcycle. Marketing In the UK the T20 was called the 'Super Six' (which refers to the motorcycle's very unusual six speed transmission, since most motorcycles had only four speeds or, rarely, five speeds) in that era. In the USA the bike was designated the X6 with the advertising department tacking on the \\"Hustler\\" name. Advertising brochures produced by Suzuki listed the following features to be found on the new model: * Claimed power of 29 hp * Claimed weight of 297 lb (135 kg) * Racing type double leading shoe 8 inch front brake * Aluminium alloy twin cylinder engine * Close ratio 6-speed transmission * Twin 24 mm carburettors * POSI-FORCE lubrication * Air pump * Scientifically designed quiet efficient mufflers * Safe powerful 8 inch rear brake * Wide type tail lamp * Safe bright turn signal lamps * 3 position adjustable shock absorbers * Wide, comfortable dual seat * 3.7 US gal (14 litre) gasoline tank * Racing type throttle * Easy-to- read tachometer and speedometer * Sturdy oil damped telescopic front fork * 12 volt fully approved lighting system In the US, Suzuki first opened a showroom featuring the X6 Hustler in Santa Monica, CA (in late 1964 or early 1965) and shortly after (in June 1965) opened a second showroom (the first on the US east coast), named Cycle City, located in Newport News, Virginia. Posi-Force system Suzuki T20 at Le Salon de la Moto 2011 in Paris The T20 was equipped with a 247 cc two-stroke engine, which meant that oil needed to be mixed with gasoline prior to injection into the cylinder. Simple two-stroke designs simply achieved this by requiring the user to combine oil and gas together (a solution known as pre-mix) before filling the fuel tank. However, in an advanced system like the T20, which was expected to operate for longer periods at higher RPMs, this would have been unsuitable. An excess amount of oil would be burned using pre-mix under these conditions, resulting in reduced performance and dirtier emissions, which in turn would cause the exhaust system to become laden with deposits, further reducing performance. The T20 solves this problem by incorporating a once-through oil injection system known as Posi-Force, which consists of an engine-driven oil pump coupled to the throttle, which is designed to provide the proper amount of oil needed at the current RPM and throttle opening. The pump draws clean oil from a separate oil tank, and pumps it through hoses into the crankcase, where it is injected into the engine outside main bearing(s) and big end rod bearings of the crankshaft. Suzuki improved upon the system by adding oil injection directly to the cylinders on newly introduced models starting in 1968 such as the T250, T305 and the T500. Suzuki would continue to use this system on many of their two- stroke motorcycle designs. Posi Force was renamed CCI (Crankcase-Cylinder- Injection) in the early 1970s and was used until the end of two stroke street bike production in the late 1990s. Racing A T20 Suzuki racing in 2005 The T20 immediately had real success on the race course in the 1960s, and many are still used to this day in Classic Racing meetings around the world. The T20 has had notable success in the Manx Grand Prix and some riders have managed to lap the famous Isle of Man course at over 100 mph on heavily modified T20s. Revival In 2013, Suzuki renewed the Hustler motorcycle trademark for Europe, leading to rumors of a retro style 250 twin in the works, or possibly a new sportbike.

Youth Although resident in Lachine, Quebec (just outside Montreal), when the future metropolitan was born, in 1963 the Ukrainian-Canadian Kalistchuk family moved to Hamilton, Ontario, where the family became members of St. Vladimir's Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral. The young George attended Ukrainian School, was involved in Ukrainian dance, the cathedral choir (where he became choir conductor in 1981-1982), and the Ukrainian Youth Organization (CYMK). Family Kalistchuk had two brothers, Albin (who died at a young age) and William. William Kalistchuk currently lives in Mississauga, Ontario, with his wife Janice and children David, Michael, Peter, and Emilie Kalistchuk. George Kalistchuk's father, Peter Kalistchuk, died in 2001, and his mother, Anastazia Kalistchuk, died on May 3, 2020 in Toronto, Ontario. University In 1970 he entered St. Andrew's College (the UOCC's Seminary), and during his three-year stay at the college he obtained many awards for his academic, musical and athletic activities at the University of Manitoba. From 1971-1973 he was assistant conductor under Archbishop Boris (Yakovkevych) and later Pavlo Macenko for the Theology Student Choir. In 1973 George received his Licentiate in Theology (L.Th.), which was replaced by a Bachelor of Theology (B.Th.) in 1985. Beginning in 1975 George studied music at McMaster University, graduating in 1980 with a Bachelor of Music in History and Theory. In 1984 he completed a Bachelor of Education degree at the University of Toronto and received an Ontario's Teacher's Certificate. During 1983-1984 he was Dean of Men at St. Vladimir Institute in Toronto. Priesthood and episcopacy In Hamilton, Ontario, on July 17, 1988 he was ordained a priest, and was assigned as rector of Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral in Winnipeg. At a special sobor (council) in 1989, George was elected bishop, and later consecrated to the episcopacy on October 22, 1989 in Winnipeg by Metropolitan Wasyly and Bishop John (Stinka). In Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on December 17, 1989 he was installed as Bishop of Saskatoon and auxiliary of the Central Eparchy of the UOCC. In 1995 he was elected Bishop of Toronto and the Eastern Eparchy, and in 2001 he was elevated to the rank of archbishop. On July 18, 2010, at the 20th Sobor of the UOCC, Archbishop Yurij was nominated to succeed John (Stinka) as the sixth Metropolitan of Winnipeg and Canada and primate of the church. Archbishop Yurij was formally elected Metropolitan of Winnipeg on August 30, 2010 by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, to which the UOCC belongs, and enthroned at Holy Trinity Metropolitan Cathedral on November 21, 2010. The arrival in Canada of Patriarch Filaret On April 19, 2012 Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk) wrote a letter to the clergy and parish councils banning the uncanonical, defrocked, and excommunicated Filaret (Denysenko) from visiting any church or property owned by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church during his trip to Canada. The ban included prohibiting any clergyman or member of the Consistory Board to be in the vicinity of Filaret during his visit. Yurij's letter upset some members of St Volodymyr's Cathedral in Toronto. The ban was publicly criticized and ignored as a banquet honouring Patriarch Filaret was held at St. Volydymyr Cultural Centre in Oakville on April 21, 2012 where Filaret toured the cemetery, chapel, and met with leaders of the Ukrainian Canadian community including Paul Grod, President of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. In a show of support by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church of Canada, Filaret was invited to attend the Divine Liturgy at St. Demetrius Ukrainian Catholic Church the following day in Toronto. At the conclusion of the Liturgy, Filaret awarded Rev. John Tataryn the Order of St. Volodymyr, 3rd Degree. The letter sparked coverage in the Ukrainian Canadian media (Svitohliad, Kontakt, Ukrainian News Edmonton, UkeTube, and social media), and lead to the creation of the Brotherhood for the Revitalization of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy in Canada (BRUOC), Facebook groups, and many YouTube videos forcing Metropolitan Yurij to respond. This Brotherhood is not recognized by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada. In an information seminar a few members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada expressed concern that the church was being sold out to the Russian Orthodox Church and that legal action must be taken.

As such, it is a procedure normally used by military aircraft at military airfields, however because it is also used by ex-military types it may sometimes be performed at civilian airfields. This maneuver is also known as initial and pitch; or in the US as an overhead maneuver or overhead break. The run The pilot circles some distance away from airfield at high speed until the air traffic controller confirms that it is safe for the procedure to begin. Once safely cleared, the pilot aligns the aircraft with the active runway and calls initial at a set time from the airfield (usually 30 seconds or one minute). The aircraft is then flown at high speed along the deadside of the runway in the landing direction at a low altitude, typically less than AGL. By contrast, approach patterns at civilian airfields in many countries are typically flown at feet AGL. The break At some point during \\"the run\\", usually midway down the runway, the pilot will fly the aircraft up and away from the runway in a tight crosswind leg, to position downwind in the pattern to land. This maneuver is performed at high-g which causes significant induced drag; this drag causes a rapid reduction of airspeed. During this the aircraft is configured to land. The aircraft therefore arrives late downwind in the pattern at a safe low speed, configured to land, with minimum time spent at lower speeds. The Red Arrows sometimes perform a spectacular variation on the run and break, which includes a 9-ship formation loop during the run segment with the aircraft breaking to alternate sides of the runway in a staggered fashion. All the Arrows thus end up at different positions downwind in the pattern to land and can land in sequence.

The annual three-day event took place in September in the city's downtown and historic Over-the-Rhine entertainment district. Founded by Cincinnati musicians Bill Donabedian and Sean Rhiney, the festival was acquired in 2008 by Cincinnati CityBeat, a weekly alternative newspaper. In 2016 the festival was acquired by Music and Event Management Inc. (MEMI).https://cincymusic.com/blog/2016/03/mpmf-memi-join-forces The festival did expand since CityBeat acquired it. The estimated attendance in 2008 was 13,500. This doubled to 27,000 people in 2012. This is partly due to the larger bands booked and the large outdoor space available for headliners at the newly renovated Washington Park in Over-the-Rhine. Though the festival used to take place in various locations throughout the greater Cincinnati region (including one venue in Newport, KY), it became located mostly in the downtown area and Over-the-Rhine, a burgeoning arts district just north of the downtown Cincinnati business district. History Most artists playing at MidPoint were alternative rock, indie rock, bluegrass, soul and singer- songwriters. 2016 The festival changed its format to be concentrated on 4 stages in parking lots in Over-the-Rhine. More than 75 bands are scheduled to perform. Bands included: Future Islands; Band of Horses; JJ Grey & Mofro; Tokyo Police Club; Reggie Watts; Lucero; Houndmouth; Antibalas; Frank Turner & The Sleeping Souls; Carseat Headrest; Wolf Parade; Frightened Rabbit; Kamasi Washington; Bob Mould 2015 The festival changed its format to run Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

Law No. 109-416, is an Act of the United States Congress (Senate Bill 843) that was signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 19, 2006. It authorizes nearly one billion dollars in expenditures, over five years beginning in 2007, to combat the autism spectrum disorders of autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and PDD-NOS through screening, education, early intervention, prompt referrals for treatment and services, and research. Legislative history The bill was introduced in the Senate by Senators Rick Santorum, R-PA and Christopher Dodd, D-CT and passed the upper chamber unanimously in August 2006. The House version, H.R. 2421, was introduced by Congresswomen Mary Bono, R-CA and Diana DeGette, D-CO and was passed by the lower chamber on December 6, 2006. The House version differed slightly from the Senate version, directing funds for research to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, rather than directly to the National Institutes of Health. \\"By passing this landmark single-disease legislation, the House has recognized the daily plight of the thousands of families struggling every day with autism, and has once and for all acknowledged autism as a national healthcare crisis,\\" said Bob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks and chairman and CEO of NBC Universal. The House passed a version that would grant more authority to scientists to determine research priorities, whereas the Senate's original measure would have included funds for expansion of research into the causes of autism. The revised bill, ultimately approved by the Senate, did not include the provisions that would have specified funding for investigating possible environmental causes. \\"This bill is a federal declaration of war on the epidemic of autism\\", said Jon Shestack, co-founder of Cure Autism Now. \\"It creates a congressionally mandated road map for a federal assault on autism, including requirements for strategic planning, budget transparency, Congressional oversight, and a substantial role for parents of children with autism in the federal decision-making process.\\" Provisions The Act provides money for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to conduct epidemiological surveillance programs and would re-authorize the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) to coordinate all efforts within the Department of Health and Human Services concerning autism, including activities carried out through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the CDC. The Combating Autism Act allocates approximately $950 million in spending on autism over five years, approximately doubling expenditures on existing programs; this includes a significant increase in spending for biomedical research in autism. The Act requires the director of NIH to develop and implement a strategic plan for autism research and a budget to fund this plan. The plan and budget would have to take into account recommendations of a public/private committee, the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, which itself would have to include at least one-third public members, a person with autism, and a person who is the parent of a child with autism. The act provides grant programs for states to develop autism screening, early diagnosis, and intervention programs for children. The act also authorizes: * The Director of the NIH to create an ‚ÄúAutism Czar‚Äù, who would coordinate NIH based-research and oversee development and budgeting of autism research and would increase the number of Centers of Excellence on Autism from eight to ten. * An information and education program and its risk factors to be provided by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to health professionals and the general public. * Commitment of $75 million a year by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), for each of the next five years, for grants for states to develop autism screening, diagnosis, and intervention programs, and to create statewide screening systems to ensure all children are screened for autism by the age of two. * $25 million a year, for five years, for technical assistance and data management to states for autism screening, diagnosis and intervention programs. The Act reauthorizes, for five years, the $12 million annual funding for the epidemiological surveillance program for autism, overseen by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Provision removed from Senate version The final version of the Combating Autism Act passed by the House and Senate eliminated a provision, originally included in the Senate bill, that would have created a legal requirement for the Centers of Excellence in Environmental Health and Autism to research \\"a broad array of environmental factors that may have a possible role in autism spectrum disorders.\\" These Centers would have authorized with funding of $45 million over the five-year life of the bill.  Criticism  The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) has criticized the bill. They think that the \\"'War on Autism' approach is not in the interests of people on the [autistic] spectrum\\" and that it \\"offends and alienates the autistic community\\". Instead of attempts to \\"cure\\" autism, ASAN advocates other methods to improve the quality of life of autistic people.

Usually, the pinhole camera parameters are represented in a 3 √ó 4 matrix called the camera matrix. This process is often called geometric camera calibration or simply camera calibration, although that term can also refer to photometric camera calibration. Camera resectioning = Homogeneous coordinates  In this context, we use [u\\\\ v\\\\ 1]^T to represent a 2D point position in pixel coordinates and [x_w\\\\ y_w\\\\ z_w\\\\ 1]^T is used to represent a 3D point position in world coordinates. In both cases, they are represented in homogeneous coordinates (i.e. they have an additional last component, which is initially, by convention, a 1), which is the most common notation in robotics and rigid body transforms.  Projection  Referring to the pinhole camera model, a camera matrix M is used to denote a projective mapping from world coordinates to pixel coordinates. :z_{c}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} u\\\\\\\\\\\\ v\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{bmatrix}=K\\\\, \\\\begin{bmatrix} R & T\\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{w}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_{w}\\\\\\\\\\\\ z_{w}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{bmatrix} =M \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{w}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y_{w}\\\\\\\\\\\\ z_{w}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{bmatrix} where M = K\\\\, \\\\begin{bmatrix} R & T\\\\end{bmatrix}. Intrinsic parameters  :K=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\alpha_{x} & \\\\gamma & u_{0} & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\alpha_{y} & v_{0} & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\end{bmatrix} The intrinsic matrix K contains 5 intrinsic parameters of the specific camera model. These parameters encompass focal length, image sensor format, and principal point. The parameters \\\\alpha_{x} = f \\\\cdot m_{x} and \\\\alpha_{y} = f \\\\cdot m_{y} represent focal length in terms of pixels, where m_{x} and m_{y} are the scale factors relating pixels to distance and f is the focal length in terms of distance. \\\\gamma represents the skew coefficient between the x and the y axis, and is often 0. u_{0} and v_{0} represent the principal point, which would be ideally in the center of the image. Nonlinear intrinsic parameters such as lens distortion are also important although they cannot be included in the linear camera model described by the intrinsic parameter matrix. Many modern camera calibration algorithms estimate these intrinsic parameters as well in the form of non-linear optimisation techniques. This is done in the form of optimising the camera and distortion parameters in the form of what is generally known as bundle adjustment. Extrinsic parameters {}\\\\begin{bmatrix}R_{3 \\\\times 3} & T_{3 \\\\times 1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0_{1 \\\\times 3} & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}_{4 \\\\times 4} R,T are the extrinsic parameters which denote the coordinate system transformations from 3D world coordinates to 3D camera coordinates. Equivalently, the extrinsic parameters define the position of the camera center and the camera's heading in world coordinates. T is the position of the origin of the world coordinate system expressed in coordinates of the camera-centered coordinate system. T is often mistakenly considered the position of the camera. The position, C, of the camera expressed in world coordinates is C = -R^{-1}T = -R^T T (since R is a rotation matrix). Camera calibration is often used as an early stage in computer vision. When a camera is used, light from the environment is focused on an image plane and captured. This process reduces the dimensions of the data taken in by the camera from three to two (light from a 3D scene is stored on a 2D image). Each pixel on the image plane therefore corresponds to a shaft of light from the original scene.  Camera resectioning  Camera resectioning determines which incoming light is associated with each pixel on the resulting image. In an ideal pinhole camera, a simple projection matrix is enough to do this. With more complex camera systems, errors resulting from misaligned lenses and deformations in their structures can result in more complex distortions in the final image. The camera projection matrix is derived from the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera, and is often represented by the series of transformations; e.g., a matrix of camera intrinsic parameters, a 3 √ó 3 rotation matrix, and a translation vector. The camera projection matrix can be used to associate points in a camera's image space with locations in 3D world space. Camera resectioning is often used in the application of stereo vision where the camera projection matrices of two cameras are used to calculate the 3D world coordinates of a point viewed by both cameras. Some people call this camera calibration, but many restrict the term camera calibration for the estimation of internal or intrinsic parameters only. Algorithms There are many different approaches to calculate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for a specific camera setup. The most common ones are: # Direct linear transformation (DLT) method # Zhang's method # Tsai's method # Selby's method (for X-ray cameras) Zhang's method Zhang model Z. Zhang, \\"A flexible new technique for camera calibration'\\", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol.22, No.11, pages 1330-1334, 2000P. Sturm and S. Maybank, \\"On plane-based camera calibration: a general algorithm, singularities, applications'\\", In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 432-437, Fort Collins, CO, USA, June 1999 is a camera calibration method that uses traditional calibration techniques (known calibration points) and self-calibration techniques (correspondence between the calibration points when they are in different positions). To perform a full calibration by the Zhang method at least three different images of the calibration target/gauge are required, either by moving the gauge or the camera itself. If some of the intrinsic parameters are given as data (orthogonality of the image or optical center coordinates) the number of images required can be reduced to two. In a first step, an approximation of the estimated projection matrix H between the calibration target and the image plane is determined using DLT method.Abdel-Aziz, Y.I., Karara, H.M. \\"Direct linear transformation from comparator coordinates into object space coordinates in close-range photogrammetry\\", Proceedings of the Symposium on Close-Range Photogrammetry (pp. 1-18), Falls Church, VA: American Society of Photogrammetry, (1971) Subsequently, applying self-calibration techniques to obtained the image of the absolute conic matrix [Link]. The main contribution of Zhang method is how to extract a constrained instrinsic K and n numbers of R and T calibration parameters from n pose of the calibration target. =Derivation= Assume we have a homography \\\\textbf{H} that maps points x_\\\\pi on a \\"probe plane\\" \\\\pi to points x on the image. The circular points I, J = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & \\\\pm j & 0\\\\end{bmatrix}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} lie on both our probe plane \\\\pi and on the absolute conic \\\\Omega_\\\\infty. Lying on \\\\Omega_\\\\infty of course means they are also projected onto the image of the absolute conic (IAC) \\\\omega, thus x_1^T \\\\omega x_1= 0 and x_2^T \\\\omega x_2= 0. The circular points project as : \\\\begin{align} x_1 & = \\\\textbf{H} I = \\\\begin{bmatrix} h_1 & h_2 & h_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ j \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} = h_1 + j h_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 & = \\\\textbf{H} J = \\\\begin{bmatrix} h_1 & h_2 & h_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -j \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} = h_1 - j h_2 \\\\end{align} . We can actually ignore x_2 while substituting our new expression for x_1 as follows: : \\\\begin{align} x_1^T \\\\omega x_1 &= \\\\left ( h_1 + j h_2 \\\\right )^T \\\\omega \\\\left ( h_1 + j h_2 \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left ( h_1^T + j h_2^T \\\\right ) \\\\omega \\\\left ( h_1 + j h_2 \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= h_1^T \\\\omega h_1 + j \\\\left ( h_2^T \\\\omega h_2 \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 0 \\\\end{align} Tsai's Algorithm It is a 2-stage algorithm, calculating the pose (3D Orientation, and x-axis and y-axis translation) in first stage. In second stage it computes the focal length, distortion coefficients and the z-axis translation.Roger Y. Tsai, \\"A Versatile Camera Calibration for High-Accuracy 3D Machine Vision Metrology Using Off-the-Shelf TV Cameras and Lenses'\\", IEEE Journal of Robotics and Automation, Vol. RA-3, No.4, August, 1987 Selby's method (for X-ray cameras) Selby's camera calibration methodBoris Peter Selby et al., \\"Patient positioning with X-ray detector self-calibration for image guided therapy\\", Australasian Physical & Engineering Science in Medicine, Vol.34, No.3, pages 391-400, 2011 addresses the auto-calibration of X-ray camera systems. X-ray camera systems, consisting of the X-ray generating tube and a solid state detector can be modelled as pinhole camera systems, comprising 9 intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Intensity based registration based on an arbitrary X-ray image and a reference model (as a tomographic dataset) can then be used to determine the relative camera parameters without the need of a special calibration body or any ground-truth data.

It is promoted by the Association for Size Diversity and Health, a tax-exempt nonprofit organization that owns the phrase as a registered trademark.\\"Association for Size Diversity and Health \\". Tax Exempt Organization Search. Internal Revenue Service. Retrieved May 29, 2018. Proponents reject the scientific consensus regarding the negative health effects of greater body weight, and argue that traditional interventions focused on weight loss, such as dieting, do not reliably produce positive health outcomes. The benefits of lifestyle interventions such as nutritious eating and exercise are presumed to be real, but independent of any weight loss they may cause. At the same time, HAES advocates argue that sustained, large-scale weight loss is difficult to the point of effective impossibility for the majority of people, including those who are obese. HAES proponents believe that health is a result of behaviors that are independent of body weight and that favoring being thin discriminates against the overweight and the obese. Stephan R√∂ssner, an obesity researcher, argues that efforts targeting weight loss may cause rapid swings in size that inflict worse physical and psychological damage than obesity itself. History Health at Every Size first appeared in the 1960s, advocating that the changing culture toward aesthetics and beauty standards had negative health and psychological repercussions to fat people. They believed that because the slim and fit body type had become the acceptable standard of attractiveness, fat people were going to great pains to lose weight, and that this was not, in fact, always healthy for the individual. They contend that some people are naturally a larger body type, and that in some cases losing a large amount of weight could in fact be extremely unhealthy for some. On November 4, 1967, Lew Louderback wrote an article called \\"More People Should Be Fat!\\" that appeared in a major national magazine, The Saturday Evening Post. In the opinion piece, Louderback argued that: # \\"Thin fat people\\" suffer physically and emotionally from having dieted to below their natural body weight. # Forced changes in weight are not only likely to be temporary, but also to cause physical and emotional damage. # Dieting seems to unleash destructive and emotional tendencies. # Eating without dieting allowed Louderback and his wife to relax and feel better while maintaining the same weight. Bill Fabrey, a young engineer at the time, read the article and contacted Louderback a few months later in 1968. Fabrey helped Louderback research his subsequent book, Fat Power, and Louderback supported Fabrey in founding the National Association to Aid Fat Americans (NAAFA) in 1969, a nonprofit human rights organization. NAAFA would subsequently change its name by the mid-1980s to the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance. In the early 1980s, four books collectively put forward ideas related to Health At Every Size. In Diets Don't Work (1982), Bob Schwartz encouraged \\"intuitive eating\\", as did Molly Groger in Eating Awareness Training (1986). Those authors believed this would result in weight loss as a side effect. William Bennett and Joel Gurin's The Dieter's Dilemma (1982), and Janet Polivy and C. Peter Herman's Breaking The Diet Habit (1983) argued that everybody has a natural weight and set-point, and that dieting for weight loss does not work. According to Lindo Bacon, in Health at Every Size (2008), the basic premise of HAES is that \\"well-being and healthy habits are more important than any number on the scale.\\" Emily Nagoski, in her book Come as You Are (2015), promoted the idea of Health at Every Size for improving women's self-confidence and sexual well-being. Science CDC Proponents claim that evidence from certain scientific studies has provided some rationale for a shift in focus in health management from weight loss to a weight-neutral approach in individuals who have a high risk of type 2 diabetes and/or symptoms of cardiovascular disease, and that a weight-inclusive approach focusing on health biomarkers, instead of weight-normative approaches focusing on weight loss alone, provides greater health improvements. There is a considerable amount of evidence that being overweight is associated with increased all-causes mortality, and significant weight loss (>10%), using a variety of diets, improves or reverses metabolic syndromes and other health outcomes associated with overweight and obesity. Obesity has been correlated with a wide variety of health problems. These problems range from congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, type 2 diabetes, infertility, birth defects, stroke, dementia, cancer, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and erectile dysfunction. A BMI greater than 30 is associated with twice the average risk of congestive heart failure. Obesity is associated with cardiovascular diseases including angina and myocardial infarction. A 2002 report concluded that 21% of ischemic heart disease is due to obesity, while a 2008 European consensus puts the number at 35%. as PDF Obesity has been cited as a contributing factor to approximately 100,000‚Äì400,000 deaths in the United States per year (including increased morbidity in car accidents). In a study with a middle-aged to elderly sample, personal recollection of maximum weight in their lifetime was recorded and an association with mortality was seen with 15% weight loss for the overweight. Moderate weight loss was associated with reduced cardiovascular risk amongst obese men. Intentional weight loss was not directly measured, but it was assumed that those that died within 3 years, due to disease etc., had not intended to lose weight. There is no evidence to support the view that some obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism; on average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their healthy-weight counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity, overweight and specific nutrient excess are recognized as diseases by the World Health Organization, and preventable causes of death worldwide. Criticism Amanda Sainsbury-Salis, an Australian medical researcher, calls for a rethink of the HAES concept, arguing it is not possible to be and remain truly healthy at every size, and suggests that a HAES focus may encourage people to ignore increasing weight, which her research states is easiest to lose soon after gaining. She does, however, note that it is possible to have healthy behaviours that provide health benefits at a wide variety of body sizes. David L. Katz, a prominent public health professor at Yale, wrote an article in the Huffington Post entitled \\"Why I Can't Quite Be Okay With 'Okay at Any Size'\\". He does not explicitly name HAES as its topic, but discusses similar concepts. While he applauds the confrontation and combating of anti-obesity bias, his opinion is that a continued focus on being 'okay at any size' may normalize ill-health and prevent people from taking steps to reduce obesity. In May 2017, scientists at the European Congress on Obesity expressed scepticism about the possibility of being \\"fat but fit\\". A twenty-year observational study of 3.5 million participants showed that \\"fat but fit\\" people are still at higher risk of a number of diseases and adverse health effects than the general population.

The awards scheme of Venture Scouts is called Rogha, an Irish word meaning Choice. Although many groups use Gaisce, the President's Award, as part of their programme also. Each group has a Venture Scout Executive which, under the guidance of an adult Scouter, designs and implements activities. A National Venture Forum Committee (NVFC) represents Venture Scouts on national administrative bodies - in line with the association's Youth Participation Policy. The NVFC meet to discuss matters of importance to Venture Scouts, and a nine-member committee is elected annually at the National Youth Forum which meets at Larch Hill. Programme As members of the Venturing section are the eldest in the association, the onus is on the youth members to plan, organise and participate in events. Lead Scouters only act in an advisory capacity. The Scout method drives the programme. Most Groups meet on a weekly basis, though some meet less frequently, in order to organise activities. Common activities include hiking, rockclimbing, mountaineering and Scout skills like camping and pioneering. Another common part of the programme is leadership, with Venture Scouts assuming a leadership role in the younger sections of Scouting Ireland. In Venture Scouting the only limit to the range of activities is the limit on the group's own imagination, so programmes vary widely from group to group. In recent times the number of Venture Scouts has decreased sharply, causing many groups to evaluate their programme in order to make it attractive to young people. It has become common for Scout Counties to form County Venture Groups when it wasn't viable for a Venture Group to exist within an individual Scout Group. Along the east coast and in Dublin Bay there are Venture Sea Scouts which operate programmes almost exclusively on the sea. Rogha Rogha (the Irish word for choice) was the Venturer Programme of CSI. It was rewritten in 2003. Rogha is an individual award scheme for Venture Scouts made up of two challenges, Silver and Gold. Upon successful completion of the Silver challenge members are awarded a Silver pin. A Gold pin is awarded for successful completion of the Gold challenge. There are 5 categories (physical, mental, cultural, social and spiritual) and approximately 50 modules. Each module is in one or more categories (e.g. Art is in Cultural, Social and Mental). To complete the Silver Challenge, participants must complete one module from each category. They must then complete the focus module with their Scouter. Focus is an evaluation of what participants have done, what participants have learned etc. The gold challenge is similar. After completing the five modules, participants need to complete Focus, as well as Horizons, an evaluation of participants' time in ventures and a look ahead at the future. Each challenge should take a year. Although not as popular now, Rogha is still used by some groups. Explorer Belt The Explorer Belt was the most prestigious award of the Venture Scout Section until the introduction of ONE Programme, at which point the award became a Rover Scout activity. Venture Scout Challenge Challenge is an event often referred to as the \\"Mini- Explorer Belt.\\" Challenge (now in its 20th year) was founded by Brian O'Connor from Cork- today the Spirit of Challenge Trophy is named after him. Like the Belt, it involves teams of two Venture Scouts of the same sex (in recent years different sex teams have also been allowed on the Challenge) walking 100 km in 5 days while living on a budget of 4 euro per person per day in Ireland. The teams get dropped off in a previously unknown location with a map of the area, their budget money, a list of challenges to complete along the route and (in recent years) a mobile phone for checking in each evening. Each participant also has their own Special Interest Badge to complete. This is a challenge that the participant has planned independently, to complete along the route, before the trip. Once back at base camp, the participants also take part in an activity to do with the Adventure Skills Badges. The participants then get assessments at the base camp over 3 days and their assessors decide which standard award the participants are awarded. Successful entrants receive the Challenge woggle, a challenge badge and a certificate of completion for their efforts. Challenge was originally run (every second year) by SAI. The SI Challenge is run annually. The events were: * 1987 - West Cork * 1989 - County Galway * 1991 - Thurles, County Tipperary * 1993 - County Kilkenny * 1995 - County Kerry * 1997 - County Sligo * 1999 - West Cork * 2001 - Isle of Man * 2003 - County Donegal * 2004 - County Clare * 2005 - County Kildare * 2006 - County Mayo, County Roscommon, County Galway * 2007 - Ireland, Wales (Postponed until 2008) * 2009 - Ireland, County Kerry - \\"Desmond\\" * 2010 - Ireland / Wales * 2011 - Ireland West * 2012 - The Lake District * 2015 - West Cork * 2016 - Northern Ireland * 2017 - Sligo/Leitrim * 2018 - Dispearsed around Portlick (westmeath) * 2019 - Tipperary/Waterford/Wexford National Venture Scout Triathlon The National Triathlon or Tri-Zone was run for the first time in September 2005. In this physical challenge teams of two people from a Venture Group complete a set course combining rafting, cycling and mountaineering. For example, the 2005 event saw teams rafting on Lough Dan (former national campsite of Scouting Ireland S.A.I.), cycling through Wicklow and hiking to Larch Hill. VMOOT The first Irish National Venture Scout Moot (aka VMOOT) took place in Larch Hill from 28 June 2007 to 1 July 2007. The event aims to cover all aspects of the Venture programme. Communities (teams of 6-8 ventures/senior Scouts) complete a project on the theme of \\"Citizenship in Motion\\". The projects reflect active citizenship and \\"learning by doing\\". Project topics have included \\"Graffiti as art\\", \\"Discrimination in Ireland\\" and \\"Young People and Drugs\\". VMoot starts with a midnight campfire on the Thursday night. On Friday morning communities must demonstrate their project. This was followed by \\"life zones\\" which included such a diverse mix of activities including pioneering, yoga and archery. On Friday night there was a dance contest (originally intended to be a music festival). On Saturday communities went off site for the \\"adventures\\" including caving, surfing and kite making. On Sunday there were several challenges devised by the participants. After the event communities must reflect on what they've learned. The venue for 2008 was Larch Hill. This event, along with \\"Vibe\\" are being replaced by new events called \\"Unplugged\\" and \\"Electric Vents\\" in 2011. Slua√≠ocht na Sl√©ibhte The Slua√≠ocht na Sl√©ibhte (SNS) is a weekend mountaineering event for teams of 3 venture Scouts. They are considered as an extension to the Scout mountaineering programme (MPC, Sionnach, PEAK) but with some key changes. The main change is the requirement for adult leader is removed. Two events are held every year- the winter expedition and the Summer Climb Ax. The first winter SNS was held in 2006 in Lugnaquilla in Wicklow. The 2007 winter SNS went to Mount Snowdon in Wales while the Summer Climb Ax was held in Annascul, Kerry. The winter and summer events in 2008 went to the Mournes and Scotland respectively. In recent years the SNS has been replaced by Mountain Havoc for Venture Scouts. Ventact South Activity Weekend Ventact South is organised by the Joint Committee on Scouting and Guiding in Cork and caters for Venture Scouts, Senior Branch and Ranger Guides from all over Ireland. The event takes place the first weekend in September each year at the Kilcully Scout Centre. Ventact South is unique as it is Irelands only Joint Event for the Senior Sections of Scouting and Guiding. The event is organized by the Ventact South Sub Committee who are part of the Joint Committee of Scouts and Guides in Cork. The committee is made up of members of Scouting Ireland, Irish Girl Guides and The Catholic Guides of Ireland. The chairperson rotates annually between the three organizations. Founding members of Ventact South in 1978 were Don Totter (Scout Association of Ireland), Liam Howe (Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland), Mary Stack (Irish Girl Guides) and Eileen McCarthy (Catholic Guides of Ireland) and the first Ventact took place from the 1st to 3 September. Participants arrive on the Friday and pitch their tents. There is normally a large campfire followed by Fire Performers. After this tickets for Saturday's activities are given out (followed by a mad dash to swap activities). On Saturday morning participants are bused offsite to do two activities (e.g. Waterskiing, Zipit, Escape Spike Island, Canoeing, Rafting, High Ropes and the Ventact Famous Monopoly Run). When they return, there is a barbecue at the campsite. On Saturday evening there is a Scouts/Guides Own followed by the ever-popular themed Ventact Disco. On Sunday morning there are activities around Kilcully Campsite before everyone heads home. Irish Venture Scout Projects * The Phoenix Venture Group from the 9th/10th Dublin (Aughrim Street) Scout Group travelled to Vietnam in Summer 2006 to undertake a development project there. They painted and decorated rooms in the Vung Tau Orphanage, near the southern tip of the country. * The Donnybrook Venturer Group won the International Youth for Development Prize 2005, nicknamed the \\"Nobel Prize for Young People\\" for their development projects in Peru. An international jury led by Jolanta Kwasniewska (First Lady of Poland), Massimo Barra (International Red Cross), Steve Fossett (Adventurer, World Records in 5 sports), Seiko Hashimoto (Member of the Parliament Japan ‚Äî Triple Olympic Medal holder), Suwit Khunkitti (Minister Thailand), Malik M'Baye (Director of UNESCO), Amaya Gillespie (United Nations Director) voted their projects as overall winner in the Development category. They were commended for their participation in the Youth of the World Campaign and for the project that they had undertaken in the framework of the UN Millennium Development Goals. * As a joint project, representatives of 3 Dublin Venture Scout Groups (35th Donore Avenue, 127th Drumcondra and 5th Port Dollymount) will be travelling to Kolkata, India in December 2008/January 2009 to work with orphaned street children at the Loreto Sealdah school. Their project will involve both manual work such as building and painting and social work such as providing English language and remedial teaching assistance. National Venture Forum Committee/National Venture Scout Representatives Every October a National Venture Forum is held in Larch Hill. Each province is entitled to send six Provincial Representatives, who have been elected at their own Provincial Forums. The nine elected Venture Representatives from the previous National Forum also attend and run the weekend. At the forum motions regard Venturing are passed and the NVFC is elected. The NVFC has 9 members (6 Provincial reps and 3 national panel members). The NVFC represent ventures at national and provincial level. They sit on programme teams (NYPC, International, Participation). The NVFC also compile reports for the Programme Commissioners to advise and guide national Venture Scout initiatives and programme for the coming year.

Steven was created by Alan Bateman as one of the serial's original characters and he first appeared in the pilot episode. Willits received the role after being one of over three hundred actors to audition for the roles of the serial's foster children. He was a regular cast member from 1988 to 1991 and again between 1995 and 1996. He has continued to make guest appearances in from 1997 until 2008. Steven is characterised in his early years by his quiet and studious persona, he later becomes problematic as he grows older. His main storylines have focused on his early tragedies in which his family die, bullying, his first kiss with Narelle Smart (Amanda Newman-Phillips) and his on/off relationship with Selina Roberts (Tempany Deckert). Critics of the serial have favoured his appearance and have subsequently branded him a \\"heart-throb\\" because of his good looks. Others have commented that he grew up quickly on-screen and eventually become a problematic character. Casting In 1987 over three hundred actors auditioned for the roles of the Fletcher's foster children.Oram 1989, p.15. Eventually sixteen-year-old Adam Willits was offered the part of Steven. Prior to the role Willits had gained a fair amount of experience as a child actor.Oram 1989, p.97. In 1989 Willits confirmed in the \\"Home and Away Annual\\" that he was happy to stay with the serial and watch Steven develop. In 1990, Willits decided to leave the serial to pursue other projects but remained on- screen until the following year.Kesta and Nicholls 1992, p.21. Willits returned to Home and Away in 1995‚Äì1996, and returned for an additional stint in 1997. In 1998 Willits filmed a conclusion to Steven's storyline on location in the UK. In 2002 Willits returned alongside numerous ex-cast members to film a special storyline for the \\"150th anniversary\\" of Summer Bay. Character development In the 1989 edition of the \\"Home and Away Annual\\", Steven is described in his years as being \\"quiet and studious, but with an inventive mind. When he came to the Flectchers, he was disturbed, and was having terrible nightmares about his parents' death.\\" They also add \\"Steven is liable to become a wonderfully caring and informed person, or a pompous brat.\\"J Clayden 1989, p.20. In the \\"Home and Away Annual\\" he is described as having the life of any average teenager.Desmond 1990, p.9. Willits described Steven stating: \\"A nice guy, not very trendy though\\". Willits has also stated it's a challenge to play Steven because he is so different from him, so much so he did not relate to him, he also branded Steven as \\"not very outgoing\\". After two years of playing the role, Willits said that Steven \\"started off as a bit of a bookworm but as he has grown up he has found distractions more engaging than academia!\\"Desmond 1990, p.12. Willits added that Steven is \\"not the trendiest guy in the world, but thankfully as time passes he gets a bit more wayward.\\"Desmond 1990, p.55. In another interview he states: \\"I love to get out of his character when shooting is finished, and to ruffle up my hair which is all brushed like Steven's.\\" While interviewed by Clive Hopwood for the book Home and Away Special, Willits said that Steven's development was slow because he remained \\"a bit of a dork\\". He added that Steven was destined for \\"exciting things\\".Hopwood 1990, p.45. Steven's first kiss is with fellow character Narelle Smart (Amanda Newman-Phillips), who is three years older than he is (being seventeen at the time). Of this Willits states: \\"I'd go for an older woman, if Steven can, I certainly can.\\"J Clayden 1989, p.21. Discussing the scenes and Steven's reasons, Willits states: \\"In the script he had this plan to get Narelle to kiss me, because he has done a survey and he's a pretty hot kisser. It wasn't as though they were in love though.\\" He also named it as one of Steven's greatest moments during the early years. Newman-Phillips describes the filming of the storyline stating: \\"Narelle seduces Steven and when it came to the kissing scene we were both very nervous. It was the first for both of us and we just couldn't get the scene right, so we did some extra rehearsing. The kiss only lasted a minute, but in the end it took us a couple of hours to get it perfect for the cameras.\\" Whilst interviewed by TV Week, Willits stated: \\"When you consider rehearsals and retakes, we kissed a hell of a lot. It was great. She gave me all the pointers\\".Oram 1989, p.98. The serial later cast Kate Raison to play artist Jennifer Atkinson, a new love interest for Steven. In the Home and Away Annual Authorised Edition, Kesta Desmond said that their romance would develop into a \\"torrid affair\\" and that it could \\"all end in tears\\".Kesta and Nicholls 1992, p.60. In another storyline school secretary Joanne Brennan (Kimberley Joseph) starts up an obsessive campaign to seduce Steven. Steven does not show any interest in return. Joseph said \\"She goes out of her way to wreck any other romance he has - and ends up stalking him.\\" Joanne continues her \\"bitchy\\" campaign until she departs. Steven had a drawn out relationship with his student Selina Roberts (Tempany Deckert), their relationship takes many \\"twists\\" along the way. Selina leaves Steven on their wedding day. Deckert said it was a \\"typical soap wedding\\" with many mishappenings. The conclusion to their storyline before Steven's final departure of the nineties, was filmed in Ironbridge, Shropshire. It was the first ever episode to be filmed abroad for the serial. When Steven returned to the show in 2002, it was revealed that he had been living in Hong Kong with Selina and taken a job as an IT consultant. Storylines=Backstory Steven was born in 1973 in Hornsby, New South Wales as the only son of Brett and Martha Matheson. One night in 1987, while Steven was staying over at his friend, Danny's house, he heard sirens belonging to fire engines and discovered that the family home was on fire and Brett and Martha were trapped. The Mathesons had put bars on the windows previously so escape was impossible. Brett and Martha died in the blaze and Steven, with no available extended family, was placed into a temporary care home until Tom (Roger Oakley) and Pippa Fletcher (Vanessa Downing) fostered him. 1988-91 Steven first appears on screen in the pilot when he and his foster family sit down to celebrate Tom's 40th birthday. Later, when Tom announces to the family that he is being retrenched, Steven offers to live elsewhere as he feels the Fletchers will be unable to afford looking after him. The family eventually relocate from The city to country town Summer Bay. Early into the Fletchers' arrival Steven manages to win the approval of foster brother Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), who has been suspicious of him since his arrival. Steven also manages to befriend local tomboy Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson), who later joins the family. Steven asks Frank for advice, he believes no one sees him as a grown up and just as a boy, he starts shaving and trying new things to look older. Steven starts feeling an attraction for Narelle, who is three years older than he is, they later kiss, Steven sees it as a big moment as it's the first time he's kissed a girl. Steven gets his first taste of a real romance when classmate, Sandra Barlow (Catherine McColl-Jones) shows an interest him. Unfortunately, Sandra's abusive father, Sam Barlow (Jeff Truman) takes an immediate dislike to Steven and warns him off. Steven and Sandra continue seeing each other secretly until Sam's behavior culminates in him accidentally shooting his wife and Sandra's mother, Kerry dead. Sandra later leaves the area to stay with a foster family in the city. Steven later has several run- ins with P.E. teacher Jeff Samuels (Alex Petersons) whose training regimes do not sit well with Steven, the Fletchers or many other people in Summer Bay. Steven is overjoyed when his uncle Philip Matheson (John Morris), his only living relative arrives in Summer Bay. Philip is later killed in an arson attack on the general store at the hands of Brian \\"Dodge\\" Forbes (Kelly Dingwall), who has a grudge against the owner Celia Stewart (Fiona Spence). Steven is devastated and begins having nightmares and flashbacks to his parents' deaths in the fire. Dodge becomes Tom and Pippa's latest foster child, he strikes up a friendship with Steven and winds him up on multiple occasions about not being macho. Dodge enjoys using Steven to do his essays and he later fools Steven into turning on his former geeky friends over a money dispute. Dodge had in fact, being bullying one of them, when they all attack him, Steven decides to attempt to attack the lads. They are shocked and tell him he's a better person than that. Dodge has a grudge against Roo Stewart's (Justine Clark) boyfriend Simon Yates (Christopher Saunders), who he tries to pin the blame on over the arson attack. He manipulates Steven into attacking him on the beach and vowing revenge. Dodge steals a car and crashes it, Steven takes the blame to protect him, but Dodge reveals it was him and vows to change. Just as everyone trusts him again, he drunkenly confesses to setting the fire that killed Phillip. Enraged, Steven tries to attack him before Dodge is charged with murder. Steven later leaves to go to university. 1995-2008 In 1995, Steven returns and gets a job at Summer Bay High as a teacher, much to Donald Fisher's (Norman Coburn) surprise. Everyone is delighted to have him back and he settles back into life with family around. When Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) returns they become better friends and eventually start a relationship, it proves short lived however and they decide it's best to be friends again. Later his student, Selina falls in love with Steven, he tells her they cannot be together because of his job and age difference. However Steven later gives in to his feelings and starts an affair with her, but they later decide to end things. Selina's stalker Jeremy Riggs (David Stanley) finds out about her and Steven so tries to black mail them, but he hangs himself in the school toilets and Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) finds out the truth, she files a complaint which sees Steven sacked from his job and everyone in town is shocked to learn about their affair. Dodge is released from prison and returns to Summer Bay, wanting revenge on Steven. Dodge hides jelly beans in Steven's house and black mails him by stating he will go to the police and tell them he has illegal drugs in his property. Scared Steven becomes extremely affected by his presence, but is happy to find out they're not drugs. Steven and Kelly Watson (Katrina Hobbs) have an affair behind Travis Nash's (Nic Testoni) back, although Kelly later decides it isn't a good idea and ends things. Kelly helps him set Dodge up for theft. Whilst out on a cruise, Dodge jumps overboard and is presumed dead. The police start a murder investigation with Steven as their prime suspect. Dodge later turns up alive and kidnaps Kelly, when Steven tracks them down they start fighting on the edge of a cliff. In the end they both roll over the edge of the cliff, Steven survives but Dodge remained unfound. After alienating himself from most of the Bay's residents and annoying Pippa when he shows no interest in his foster sister Sally Fletcher's (Kate Ritchie) abduction, he decides to rethink his place in the town. Sally is found and goes to hospital and waits for Steven. Steven leaves Pippa a note and flees the town, without saying goodbye to his closest family member Sally. One year later he returns feeling in a better place. He starts to fall for Selina again, delighted they resume their relationship. This time more people approve and they decide to get married. On their wedding day however, Selina seemingly jilts Steven. She is actually being held hostage by cult leader Saul Bennett (David Ritchie), later she escapes and Steven is relieved to have her back. She shocks him by telling him she no longer wants to marry him after her ordeal. He leaves the bay once more. After another year passes Marilyn and Irene decide to head overseas to, Ironbridge when Selina is severely ill, they arrange for Steven to come and look after her. When he arrives he proposes to Selina, who gladly accepts. They leave the bay together this time. Steven returns in 2000 for Sally's wedding to Kieran Fletcher (Spencer McLaren), he reveals that he and Selina still haven't got married. After Keiran's infidelity is discovered, Steven beats him up on the beach which Steven should have been arrested and spent time in prison for. Steven returns again later and reveals he and Selina have married, he returns again the following year and announces he and Selina broke up and he was with someone new. In 2008 he returns when Sally decides to leave Summer Bay, after Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) gets in touch with him, he reveals he and Selina got back together. Pippa and Carly also join him, He tells Sally how much she deserves her big send off and they reminisce about the old days when they first moved into the house on the caravan park. After Sally leaves, Steven is not seen on-screen again. Reception In his book, Super Aussie Soaps, Andrew Mercado describes the moment Steven decides to marry Selina as a scandal because she was his student.Mercado 2004, p.261. In her book \\"Soapbox\\", Hilary Kingsley brands Steven the quietest foster child of Pippa and Tom.Kingsley 1989, p.214. In the book \\"Home and Away: behind the scenes\\", James Oram comments on Steven's young heart-throb status, stating: \\"Those who concern themselves with such matters as heart-throbs suggest he is well on his way to joining that select circle. He could be the youngest heart-throb in history, or at least since Romeo caused Juliet's heart to flutter.\\"Oram 1989, p.96. He also added that whilst the serial followed the tradition of many other soaps, through Steven and Frank they portrayed many real issues. Jan Moir writing for the Evening Times states: \\"He was orphaned when his parents were killed in a fire and is fast becoming the problem kid on the block.\\" The Birmingham Post observed Steven's relationship with Selina as a \\"tale of twists\\" becoming more \\"twisted\\" with time. A columnist for The Newcastle Herald chose Steven and Selina's 1998 return episode as one of their \\"TV Highlights\\". Analysing Steven's early characterisation, a columnist for Inside Soap said \\"once the school swat and a bit of a square, he grew up into an egghead who couldn't get a girl. Duller than one of Alf Stewart's bowling club cheese and wine parties, quiet Steven Matheson seemed destined to stay single.\\" They opined that upon his return in 1995, Steven no longer had trouble finding a partner but had a \\"problem\\" finding one his own age. Their colleague opined that Steven was the \\"brightest foster kid\\" that Pippa had ever fostered. While another opined that \\"there was never any doubt that the quiet and studious Steven would end up at uni - even if a passionate fling with an older woman made him think twice about going. Steven passed his HSC with flying colours.\\" References ;Bibliography  Home and Away characters Television characters introduced in 1988 Fictional schoolteachers Fictional mathematicians Fictional karateka Fictional orphans Male characters in television ","title":"Steven Matheson"},{"id":"6319302","text":"Visit by the president of the Hellenic Republic, Karolos Papoulias to the Vasso Katraki museum in Aitoliko, Greece.

Its twofold objective is to sponsor research and foster support groups in human body weight control. Most members refer to the organization simply as \\"TOPS\\", an acronym for \\"Take Off Pounds Sensibly.\\" Weight control philosophy TOPS originally formed in 1948 as a response to the need to assist overweight and obese people to lose weight by setting up a support group system. Over the years as more weight management problems were identified, TOPS expanded their scope to include all people with weight problems. They also created an incentive for club members who reach and maintain their weight at their goal level to stay in the club as KOPS (Keeps Off Pounds Sensibly) members‚Äîgiving them extra recognition to help encourage other members in the club. TOPS does not endorse any particular weight-loss plan (see dieting) and welcomes people into the membership even if they are actively involved in any weight-loss plan. Club meetings emphasize nutrition, exercise, motivation, behavior modification and wellness education focused on supplementing a member's effort to manage his or her weight. Real Life: A Hands-On Pounds Off Guide coauthor be leaders in these fields is provided free to all chapters. TOPS publishes educational materials for its members as well as a bimonthly membership magazine, TOPS News. Local chapter meetings A local chapter of the club is set up in a small region, usually covering one community. Larger communities may have more than one chapter, either because of size limitations or to address the various schedules of their members. According to their web site, the average chapter has 20 members. The total membership as of 2017 is almost 120,000 in the US and Canada. Only 4 people are needed to start a meeting in their community. Members meet weekly both for weight recording (\\"weigh-in\\") and for the main session. The weigh-in is performed in a private room with two members present as recording officers. As such, the weight records are considered medically sound. Members are required to consult with their health care professional for a written goal weight for themselves. This goal is turned in to the recorders. The membership fee is $32/year in the USA and $46/year in Canada.https://www.tops.org/tops/TOPS/HowItWorks.aspx The main session in a chapter meeting is usually one of two types: education or special recognition. In either case, the meeting begins with a report of total losses or gains, in pounds, for the week, as tabulated from the just-completed weight recording. Individual members are recognized for such things as losing the most pounds in one week among all the members. Small prizes are awarded to these \\"losers\\" (the word used within the confines of TOPS instead of \\"winners\\"). These prizes are funded from the weekly dues (one to two dollars) collected from the members. Special recognition involves more elaborate award ceremonies for \\"losers\\" based on several criteria such as most pounds lost in a month or year, best overall improvement, and maintaining goal-weight for a KOPS (Keep Off Pounds Sensibly). International Recognition Days The most successful male and female members reaching their goal weights in the current year (KOPS) from each state and province are recognized as Kings and Queens at regional events each spring. They are then invited to attend International Recognition Days, a two-day convention which is held each summer in a different U.S. or Canadian city. A highlight of IRD is the crowning of the International King and Queen and Runners-up. The winners are chosen according to which Kings and Queens lost the most total weight to reach the weight-loss goal set with their health care professional. The International King and Queen are often chosen for losing 200 pounds or more. IRD is also an opportunity for education and inspiration. TOPS features several health and fitness experts as well as motivational speakers throughout IRD. Medical research TOPS Club, Inc. has been actively involved in the clinical study of obesity and metabolic research since 1966, and has contributed almost $9 million to the Medical College of Wisconsin in support of these efforts. The TOPS Obesity and Metabolic Research Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was established in 1994. It also supports the efforts of the TOPS Genome Registry at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC, under the direction of Michael Olivier, Ph.D. TOPS sponsors research awards presented annually through the Obesity Society and scholarships and a research award in alternating years through Obesity Canada. Work done at the TOPS Obesity and Metabolic Research Center has contributed to milestones of obesity research, including: ‚Ä¢ The paper entitled ‚ÄúBiology of Regional Body Fat Distribution: Relationship of to non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus‚Äù. Findings in this study led to the terms ‚Äúapple shaped‚Äù vs. ‚Äúpear shaped‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ Identification of a gene that plays a significant role in determining blood levels of HDL cholesterol, commonly referred to as ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol. More than 500 TOPS families participated as research volunteers in those studies, making them among the largest family studies conducted in the United States. Findings have been published in over 200 of the most reputable scientific papers including The Journal of American Medicine Association, and Nature Genetics. The journal Obesity published the study \\"Determining the Effectiveness of Take Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS), a Nationally Available Nonprofit Weight Loss Program\\" by Nia S. Mitchell, L. Miriam Dickinson, Allison Kempe and Adam G. Tsai in its March 2011 issue. That study, conducted at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, found those who spent three years in TOPS lost five to seven percent of their body weight and kept it off.\\" TOPS also supports and encourages obesity research through The Obesity Society and Obesity Canada and partners with many nonprofit and governmental initiatives to combat obesity, including former First Lady Michelle Obama's \\"Let's Move\\" campaign. TOPS partners with Dr. Rena Wing, Ph.D., and the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center affiliated with Brown Medical School, where TOPS members are the subjects in a study of \\"Successful Weight Losers.\\" TOPS members also participate in the National Weight Loss Registry, which is also sponsored by the Brown Medical School. TOPS partnered in the \\"Bias, Discrimination and Obesity\\" study co-authored by Dr. Rebecca Puhl, Ph.D. and Dr. Kelly Brownell, Ph.D. of Yale University. TOPS meets with healthcare professionals at a variety of national conferences throughout the year (such as The Obesity Society, American Dietetic Association/Food & Nutrition Conference, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators). The organization also established the TOPS Achievement Award for scientists who have made major contributions to the field of obesity research in affiliation with The Obesity Society.

During his lifetime he was the head of the Taluqdar association of Oudh. From 1924 to 1928 he was the education minister of Uttar Pradesh. His main contributions were the passage of the Agra University act, the creation of Bhatkhande College of Hindustani Music and passing of primary education system of education in India. In the early part of the 20th century the Hindustani music was confined to temples. Dr Rai Rajeshwar Bali was instrumental in bringing the Hindustani classical music to the public by opening one of the first music colleges of India called the Bhatkhande College of Hindustani Music in Lucknow. For this he invited Pundit V. N. Bhatkhande and requested him to write the grammar of Hindustani Classical Music. Dr Rai Rajeshwar Bali was also an avid Krishna Bhakt and his Phag and Panje are still recited in Vrindavan, the lila sthal of Bhagwan Krishna. Rai Rajeshwar Bali, at the age of 27, earned great respect and awe for his creative activities and was recognized among stalwarts like Rabindranath Tagore, Dr. Radhakrishnan, Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya and others, who had regular interactions with him on cultural matters. Purely in recognition of his brilliant creative activities, the then Governor of UP Sir William Marris appointed Rai Rajeshwar Bali as the Minister of education in 1922. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours. The passing of the Agra University Act and Primary Education Bill in UP Assembly was also due to his efforts. For this, he was not only conferred a Degree of the Doctor of literature by the Lucknow University, but his name was given a place of honor in the Encyclopedia of Great Men of the World, published from the USA.

A general computational problem may have numerical parameters. For example, the input to the bin packing problem is a list of objects of specific sizes and a size for the bins that must contain the objects‚Äîthese object sizes and bin size are numerical parameters. A problem is said to be strongly NP-complete (NP- complete in the strong sense), if it remains so even when all of its numerical parameters are bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. A problem is said to be strongly NP-hard if a strongly NP-complete problem has a polynomial reduction to it; in combinatorial optimization, particularly, the phrase \\"strongly NP-hard\\" is reserved for problems that are not known to have a polynomial reduction to another strongly NP-complete problem. Normally numerical parameters to a problem are given in positional notation, so a problem of input size n might contain parameters whose size is exponential in n. If we redefine the problem to have the parameters given in unary notation, then the parameters must be bounded by the input size. Thus strong NP- completeness or NP-hardness may also be defined as the NP-completeness or NP- hardness of this unary version of the problem. For example, bin packing is strongly NP-complete while the 0-1 Knapsack problem is only weakly NP- complete. Thus the version of bin packing where the object and bin sizes are integers bounded by a polynomial remains NP-complete, while the corresponding version of the Knapsack problem can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time by dynamic programming. While weakly NP-complete problems may admit efficient solutions in practice as long as their inputs are of relatively small magnitude, strongly NP-complete problems do not admit efficient solutions in these cases. From a theoretical perspective any strongly NP-hard optimization problem with a polynomially bounded objective function cannot have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (or FPTAS) unless P = NP. However, the converse fails: e.g. if P does not equal NP, knapsack with two constraints is not strongly NP-hard, but has no FPTAS even when the optimal objective is polynomially bounded. Some strongly NP-complete problems may still be easy to solve on average, but it's more likely that difficult instances will be encountered in practice.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 18 May 1989. When Symons auditioned for the role she created a backstory for the character and dressed in a mini dress, stilettos and put on a breathy voice. She was successful and producer Andrew Howie cast her in the role. Writers introduced her as the girlfriend of established character Lance Smart (Peter Vroom). Marilyn is characterised as a bubbly and ditsy hairdresser who often makes She has a distinct bouffant hairstyle and unique dress sense which includes high heel shoes. Marilyn has become one of the show's most iconic characters during her tenure. Symons departed on 23 July 1992, but she returned on 5 June 1995 and stayed for four years, making her last appearance on 1 October 1999. She made a brief return from 31 August 2001 to 4 September 2001. In 2010, it was announced that Symons would be returning to Home and Away and Marilyn returned on 19 March 2010. Marilyn's storylines have included being married twice, suffering from post-natal depression, losing her son, being electrocuted and developing cancer. Her significant relationships have been with Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn), Sid Walker (Robert Mammone) and later John Palmer (Shane Withington). Casting Symons was nervous when she decided to audition for the role because she had previously been turned down for several parts in other shows. To prepare for her audition Symons and her acting coach created a backstory for Marilyn and they got to know her better. Symons decided to put on a \\"breathy voice\\" and purchased stiletto shoes for the character. This left Symons feeling like she knew exactly how the character should be portrayed. Symons travelled to Kings Cross area of Sydney for her audition and was accompanied by her mother. She made her parent wait in a nearby coffee shop and had to climb over a drunk sleeper obstructing the audition building doorway. Symons was pessimistic about gaining the role because so many actresses turned up to audition. She entered the audition dressed in a mini dress, stilettos and a face full of \\"big eighties make-up\\". She was successful and invited back to the subsequent stages of the audition. Symons felt that she impressed the casting department and producer Andrew Howie offered her the role and she began filming her first scenes is March 1989. Dannii Minogue also auditioned for the role of Marilyn, before she was given the role of Emma Jackson. Symons made her first screen appearance as Marilyn in 1989. The actress quit Home and Away in 1992 to marry Nick Lipscombe. Three years after separating from Lipscombe, Symons returned to the soap. She stayed for another four years, before announcing her departure in 1999, so she could move to England to be with her then fianc√©. She filmed her last scenes towards the end of the year. In 2001, Home and Away came to the United Kingdom to film some special episodes to help celebrate the show's return to British screens. Symons re-joined the cast as Marilyn for the London filming. On her return Symons said \\"When I left Home and Away two years ago I actually asked for my character Marilyn to be killed off. Now I'm glad they didn't.\\" Character development=Characterisation When Marilyn is introduced into the series she lives in the neighbouring town of Yabbie Creek and works as a hairdresser and beautician. Symons told Jason Smith from the official Home and Away podcast that she was \\"very ditsy, she was an orphan and she hadn't completed her education. She used to get quite muddled and all her words mixed up, full of life but not very smart.\\" Symons chose three words to describe her as \\"kind, funny and warm\\". The show's producer Lucy Addario described her as \\"beautiful, kind and a girls best friend\\", adding that she is a \\"nurturing\\" character. Marilyn has also been described as the \\"ditzy chick-next-door\\" who has a heart of gold, but lacked a \\"bit of common sense\\". A writer for Holy Soap called Marilyn \\"bubbly\\" and a \\"Dizzy blonde beautician\\". Marilyn is known for her bouffant hairstyle and her \\"daring\\" dress sense. Of this Symons said \\"Marilyn is who she is and doesn't care what anybody thinks. In her mind that's how a lady of her age would dress ‚Äì she thinks it's absolutely normal and is proud of her style, although Colleen definitely disapproves!\\" When asked if she would like Marilyn to receive a makeover, Symons said that she does not want to see her character change. She explained that Marilyn would not be Marilyn and a makeover would not be \\"true to the character.\\" To add authenticity to Marilyn's role as the local hairdresser and beautician, writers created a story in which she opens her own salon. She calls her business \\"Marylin Chambers' Beauty Chamber\\" and off-screen production struggled to decide where the salon should be located. They created an additional set which was attached to the fictional diner included in the show. The Home and Away art designer Ken McCann decided to decorate it in a \\"camp\\" leopard print style setting. In this set Marilyn would portray comedy stories in which she ruins other character's hair styles in ditsy mistakes. Symons described the 2010 Marilyn as \\"still the bubbly, positive, energetic and slightly bonkers '80s chick, but more spiritual\\". She added that Marilyn has done a lot of soul searching and feels that she now has a reason to come back. She has a new lease on life and she is embracing religions, magic and tribal beliefs. Her \\"ultra positive outlook\\" on life and her vegan food annoyed Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart), but they soon got used to living together. Holy Soap also said that Marilyn has known \\"severe heartache\\" after she lost her son, Byron to cancer, divorced Donald and is now seriously ill. Yahoo!7 say that she is still \\"tender\\" over Byron's death, but she has come to realise that life is for living. Marilyn's best friend, Mitzy Fraser (Helen Dallimore), is a \\"kindred soul\\". She is a psychic, who helped Marilyn deal with her grief over Byron and her recovery from cancer. Dallimore described Marilyn as \\"sweet, open minded and trusting.\\" Relationship with Lance Smart Marilyn's first relationship is with Lance Smart (Peter Vroom) and ultimately the pairing does not work out. First Marilyn and Lance get engaged and she goes wedding dress shopping. Their engagement followed a series of arguments curbed by Lance planning a surprise meal and marriage proposal. Symons told to David Brown writing for TV Week \\"that's what she's always wanted, then she goes full swing. She buys a wedding dress and starts to refurbish Lance's home!\\" Symons later recalled \\"I've got a old photo of me [Marilyn] in a wedding dress, but he dumped Marilyn before they got to the altar, so the wedding never happened.\\" The break down of their relationship came at a time when Vroom was due to leave the series. They also had to contend with Lance's mother Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood). She is over protective of Lance and writers never forget this link. By the time Marilyn returned in 2010, Colleen still does not \\"like or trust\\" Marilyn for breaking \\"her Lancey's' heart\\". Marriage to Phil Bryant Marilyn goes through \\"a tough time\\" when it comes to relationships until she meets Phil Bryant (Vince Martin), a \\"no-nonsense country bloke\\". Phil turns up in Summer Bay to drop off his teenage daughter, Toni (Kathryn Dufty), on a school exchange trip. When he almost collides with Marilyn and crashes his car, he is forced to stay in the area longer than planned. Marilyn takes an immediate liking to Phil and he is won over by her \\"bubbly personality.\\" However, he does have doubts about how the relationship will work as Marilyn is twenty-four and he is forty. Marilyn eventually convinces him that he is the man for her and Martin explained, \\"Phil will bring her the stability she needs in her life. His maturity and her enthusiasm for life will make a nice balance. Besides, Marilyn's had her heart broken too often.\\" After a few ups and downs, Phil asks Marilyn to marry him and she accepts. They are married and leave the Bay to start a new life together. Martin commented that the idea of Marilyn living on an isolated bush farm seemed unlikely and thought she would feel out of place. He added \\"On top of that, they've only known each other for a few weeks when they decide to marry. But if their love is strong enough, they'll make a go of it.\\" Marriage to Donald Fisher One of Marilyn's most important story arcs saw her begin an unlikely relationship with Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn). When Marilyn decides to go back to school as a mature student to get her HSC, she and headmaster Donald grow close. Years later when she returns to Summer Bay the friendship continues and, to the shock of the local residents, they begin a romance. Their marriage was one of Home and Away's most shocking storylines as Donald was twice Marilyn's age. Of this, Symons said \\"Although the storyline of a girl's affair with a much older man was a controversial one, in the end it went down well with the viewers.\\" Marilyn and Donald's wedding ceremony was filmed on location at Palm Beach on one of the coldest days in Sydney for one hundred years. Symons said \\"the wedding dress wasn't exactly a winter frock. It really was absolutely freezing. We were all purple and chilled at the end of the day.\\" The character's wedding reception and dance scenes were filmed in the comfort of a warm studio. Marilyn yearns to have a child and after a miscarriage and years of trying, she undergoes risky surgery in a bid to conceive. Symons told Steven Murphy from Inside Soap that Marilyn is putting her life in danger because the operation could kill her. She defended her character, adding \\"it's so important to her, Donald doesn't want her to have the operation, but he supports her all the way when he realises how determined she is.\\" Filming the story proved difficult for Symons, who had to portray a number of emotional scenes. In one scene Marilyn and Donald are \\"nervous and frightened\\" as she is about to be taken to theatre. Symons described their plight as \\"really quite moving\\" and while she was happy to explore more serious stories for her character, she found it \\"emotionally draining.\\" Marilyn is known for her stylish dress sense and during the story she was often scene in a pink tracksuit. Symons felt uncomfortable in it and preferred her character's mini dresses and high heel shoes. She added \\"it was horrible, the more I cried in the scenes, the worse I looked - so the producers left me that way.\\" Symons concluded that Marilyn would make a \\"wonderful mum\\" because of her \\"energy and enthusiasm.\\" Marilyn eventually becomes pregnant, much to her and Donald's delight. Symons had to wear a fatsuit for the storyline and she told an Inside Soap reporter that it made her sympathetic to real mums-to-be. Marilyn goes into labour two weeks early with Vinnie Patterson (Ryan Kwanten) at her side. Symons explained the situation, \\"All of a sudden Marilyn doubles up in pain and realises that the baby is coming. It's all terribly dramatic it's down to Vinnie to try to get her to the hospital in time.\\" At the hospital, complications develop and put the baby's life in danger, so the doctors decide to put Marilyn under anaesthetic and perform a caesarean. The baby, a boy, is delivered safely, but when he is handed to Marilyn she does not understand why she was not awake for his birth. Marilyn is also upset that Donald missed the birth and Symons said \\"She's still in shock and a lot of pain - she can't quite believe it's all happened and that this baby is hers.\\" Donald and Marilyn decide to call their new son, Byron Vincent. The traumatic birth leaves Marilyn in a \\"shattered state of mind\\" and she finds it difficult to form an emotional bond with Byron. Symons said that Marilyn discovers that being a mother is hard work and the situation will put pressure on Marilyn and Donald. She added that she was happy that her character had finally achieved her dream of having a child and once the shock wore off, she believed that Marilyn would be a great mother. Months later Byron is diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer and Marilyn and Donald's marriage begins to fall apart. They make the decision to leave Summer Bay and go to America to find treatment. During the trip, Byron dies, leaving Marilyn devastated. She lets Donald go back to Australia alone. A year later, the former couple reunite in London where they realise that their marriage is over. 2010 return In 2010, it was announced that Symons would be returning to Home and Away as a permanent cast member. The producers brought back the character of Marilyn after a meeting in mid-2009, which saw them decide to inject more comedy into the show. A suggestion to create a character just like Marilyn was put forward, but instead they chose to bring back the original character. Symons had returned to Australia in 2008 to care for her mother and the show's producers called her in September 2009, asking her to reprise the role of Marilyn. Of her decision to return, Symons said \\"I was very happy on the show and it's been a part of my life for so long; to come back to it is like coming back to a family.\\" Symons added that she loves playing the character. In meetings with scriptwriters, Symons made sure that they paid respect to her character's past, particularly the storyline where she lost Byron. Of this Symons said \\"With Marilyn there is so much history, so giving their son Byron some acknowledgement is important, just as its important to remember she was Mrs Bellingham's cleaner, that she worked in the shop with Alf and her storyline with Lance.\\" The character's return marked the show's effort to lighten up the tone of recent plots and go back to the family-based storylines of the show's original layout. Marilyn returned to screens on 19 March 2010. Marilyn returns to Summer Bay with \\"a new lease on life\\" and a wooden ventriloquist's doll called Mr Oddly, which she decides to use for her new fortune telling business. Holy Soap explained that Marilyn has been \\"forever changed\\" by Byron's death and her cancer, but she is determined to live life to the full. Not long after her return, Marilyn begins a relationship with the local doctor, Sid Walker (Robert Mammone). Adoption When Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) discovers she is pregnant, the first person she tells is Marilyn. Nicole later decides to give her baby to Marilyn and Sid Walker (Robert Mammone). However, becoming a mother is one of Marilyn's dreams and her obsession with this and her controlling behaviour becomes too much for Nicole. Of the situation, Symons said \\"Marilyn is in Nicole's face every minute. She's doing it out of love, but she doesn't realise she's becoming obsessed with the baby.\\" Nicole is still unsure whether she is making the right choice about her child's future and she snaps at Marilyn. When Nicole begins seeing Angus McCathie (Tim Pocock), Marilyn is left worried about their agreement and she feels \\"distanced.\\" Symons explained, \\"Marilyn is scared of being replaced. She's scared of losing the baby, which could happen because there isn't a legal agreement.\\" Marilyn talks to Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) and she comes to the realisation that she needs to step back from the situation. Symons added that there is \\"still a long way to go\\" with the arrangement. Marilyn is then supportive and on hand to help Nicole. Nicole gives birth to a baby boy, George, and she hands him over to Marilyn a couple of days later. George struggles with being parted from his real mother and Nicole tries to stay away, but he needs her. Marilyn then becomes obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. Symons later revealed that Nicole struggles to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole comes to visit the baby and Marilyn catches her breastfeeding George, while she is alone with him. Symons called the scenes \\"volatile.\\" Marilyn has already had reservations about Nicole spending time with the baby and she fears that Nicole is getting too close. Of the breastfeeding moment, Symons said \\"Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother. Without a doubt, Marilyn thinks Nicole is overstepping the mark. She feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it could put a big strain on their relationship.\\" After the incident, Marilyn asks Nicole to stay away from the baby. Marilyn becomes aware of Nicole's increasing interest in George and the ideas that Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz) has been putting into her head. Of this, Holy Soap said \\"Marilyn's world begins to unravel when she realises that Nicole intends to reclaim George and, after seeking advice from Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances), she's faced with the reality that she doesn't have a legal leg to stand on.\\" Marilyn becomes desperate and tries to discredit Nicole and Angelo as parents, but convincing Sid is hard for her as he has not been 100 percent into the idea of raising George. Marilyn takes George and Symons said \\"She's emotionally fragile [and] we've seen her break down and then become very resolved about keeping George. What she does next is out of character for her and very irresponsible. It will definitely shock viewers.\\" Electric shock and amnesia In August 2015, it was announced that Marilyn would be electrocuted in \\"a freak accident\\" at the Diner. The storyline began when Marilyn came into contact with some exposed wires while mopping the floor of the Diner. Her friends Roo and Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) found her lying lifeless on floor and called an ambulance. Marilyn's husband John Palmer (Shane Withington) was \\"devastated\\" when he learned what had happened and he rushed to the hospital to be with her. The actor commented, \\"John sees Marilyn as his last chance at love in many ways, and he's distraught.\\" Marilyn was placed in an induced coma while her test results were being processed. John became frustrated when the doctors were unable to give him definite answers as to whether Marilyn would pull through. When Marilyn woke up from the coma, she suffered from amnesia and thought it was 1996. She believed she was still married to Donald and failed to recognise John at all. As Marilyn recovered from her ordeal, she moved in with Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) and some of her memories started to return. She was also happy to see Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) when he returned from a trip away. Meanwhile, John struggled to cope with Marilyn's memory loss, but he refused to give in and he asked Marilyn out on a date. Marilyn agreed and John used the opportunity to try to prompt her into remembering who he was. While John was telling Marilyn a story, it caused her to suddenly remember Sid. John felt \\"desperately sad\\" and wondered if it was time to end their marriage. However, as he left the Diner, Marilyn followed him out and recalled the moment they became a couple. John then told her the story and she remembered him and their wedding day. Temporary departure and return In February 2015, Symons announced that she was pregnant with her first child and would be taking six months maternity leave from the show starting in June. On-screen, Marilyn and John's marriage began to suffer in the wake of her accident and her changed outlook on life. She admitted that she was not ready to be a foster parent and that she also wanted to travel overseas. John did not share Marilyn's views and preferred to stay in the Bay, causing an argument. Shortly before their vow renewal ceremony, Marilyn learned that her adoptive son Jett James (Will McDonald) was unable to make it and she decided to call the whole thing off. Roo, Leah and Irene managed to talk her around and the ceremony went ahead. Marilyn then left the Bay to go travelling. On 13 June 2016, Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy confirmed Marilyn would be returning during the week commencing 20 June. Symons said Marilyn would return home after learning Alf had suffered a heart attack. When she is reunited with John, it becomes apparent that Marilyn has changed during her time away. Symons explained, \\"He thought they could pick up just where they left off. But the dynamic between them has changed. She has come back more sophisticated and John is left feeling very parochial.\\" Storylines=1989‚Äì2001 Marilyn arrives in Summer Bay from Sydney to see her boyfriend, Lance.

A writer from Inside Soap included Marilyn and Donald in their feature profiling unlikely couples. They branded her a \\"half-wit hairdresser\\" and him a \\"haggard head\\" who found happiness together.

Their genealogies claim that they are kindred with the E√≥ganachta (themselves led by the MacCarthys), descended paternally from Ailill Aulom. From the Middle Ages until 1552, the family ruled an area within the Kingdom of Munster known as √âile. The last monarch Tiege Caoc O'Carroll surrendered and regranted to the Tudor Kingdom of Ireland. Etymology Notable is the history of the √ì Cearbhaill whose territory, known as Ely O'Carroll in √âile, consisted of the pasture lands of Ballycrinass, Rosscullenagh and Drumcan, extending to the Lake of Leghagh, commonly Laghaghirisallive and bounded on the west by the lands called Laghenagarken and on the east adjoining or near to Glencrokin. This was always known as Ely O'Carroll. The mountain land extended from the Laghanagerah (Lochan na gCaorach) to Polle Dowa (Poll Dubh in Roscomroe) and then in a south easterly direction to the Slieve Bloom Mountains, which are the limits between Ely O'Carroll and Upper Ossory meeting at a village called Garryvoe or Scully's land.The Extent of Ely O'Carroll The Ely O'Carroll sept was the most powerful and most famous, but there were at least four other septs, O'Carroll of Oriel in the Dundalk area, O' Carrolls of Ossory in the Carlow/Kilkenny area and two septs in the Kerry area.IRISH FAMILIES, Edward MacLysaght, 1972 The prefix \\"O'\\" is very often dropped in the case of this surname, occasionally replaced with \\"Mac\\". Carvill is another anglicization of the same family name. History Of Gaelic Irish descent, the Carrolls have their origins in the ancient kingdom of √âile,Ireland's History in Maps - Tuadmumu (North Munster) commonly anglicized Ely, as a branch of the ruling O'Carroll family.Carroll of Maryland (O'Hart 1892) The Ely O'Carroll come from counties Offaly and Tipperary in Ireland. The sept is also known as Eile and Clan Cian. One descendant, Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737‚Äì1832), was a wealthy landowner in Maryland and a signer of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. His cousin, Dan Carroll, was also a signer of the Constitution. Historic Ely O'Carroll surnames are: Carroll, Bohan/Bowen, Dooley, Meagher/Maher/Mahar/Mahan, Kelly/Kealy, Flanagan, Corcoran, Healy, Nevin, O'Connor. Clan Cian was also known as the Cianachta, the Race of Cian, who was the youngest son, of Olioll Ollum King of Munster, and Grandson, of King Eoghan Mor the 1st (known as) Mogh Nuadath of Leith Mogha (Mogha‚Äôs Half) of southern Ireland of the Milesian race of Heber, who contested for supremacy of all Ireland in the second century of the Christian Era. The Cianachta were led well over 1500 years by a recognized King, Prince, High Chief, or Ruling Lord chosen from members of the O‚ÄôCarroll-Carroll and rival Houses of the noble Septs of √âile In the fifth century the Cianacht Chief, √âile Righ Derg (Eile, the Red King) ruled the territory that came to be known as Ely O'Carroll to distinguish the area from other O'Carroll kingdoms and lands. The Kingdom of √âile (Ely) was located anciently in Ormond in the Counties Tipperary, Waterford and extending into Offaly, Leix, Kilkenny. Cearbhaill (Carroll) Son, of Aeodh, and Chief of the Cianachta was King of √âile at the turn of the first millennium. This Cearbhaill, the King of √âile, led the Elyans at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 with the High King of Ireland, Brian Boru. F.J. \\"Eile\\" O'Carroll, the late O'Carroll of √âile O'Carroll created Clan Cian through the Charter of Re-Formation in 1982-1983??as his personal clan for all Cianachta whose families originally lived within the regions ruled by The O'Carroll of √âile O'Carroll in Ireland as well as to all people who wish to honor their background and the ideals that Clan Cian promotes - Irish culture in all its manifestations and the exploration of expatriate Irish's roots back to Ireland. Betham's History of O'Carroll The following is quoted from the Ordnance survey letters to King's County (Offaly) 1838 cit. Sir William Betham's Irish Antiquarian Researches. Part I, Pg.95. Sir William Betham (1779‚Äì1853) was the Ulster King of Arms and can be considered a fairly reliable source as such. The family of O'Carroll, according to the Irish antiquaries, are descended from Kean, the third son of Olioll Olum, King of Munster. Teige, the eldest son of this Kean, was a distinguished warrior, who by killing in battle his three rivals, procured for Cormac Mac Art, King of Ulster, the Monarchy of Ireland. Cormac rewarded him with a grant of land in Connaught called Lurgny Gallen and Culavin, he paying to the King of Connaught and his successors, 150 milch cows in May; 100 beeves and 100 barrels of mead or Metheglin at Alhallontide yearly, forever. He had two sons, Conla and Cormac Galeng; to the latter he gave the lands of Lurgny Gallen, now called the Barony of Gallen in the County of Mayo and Culavin, which were possessed by his descendants, the O'Haras and O'Garas. Conla, the eldest son, possessed the lands afterwards called Duthec Eile, i.e., the Estate of Eile, from Eile Ridheargs, of which his descendants were styled Kings, there being no other title of honour in use in Ireland before the coming of the English. Cearbhaill, the twelfth according to some, and the 16th in descent according to other authorities, from the above Eile, gave name to the Sept of the O'Carrolls, i.e., the descendants of Cearbhuill. The tenth in descent from him was Teige or Thatheus O'Cearbhuill Boy, King of Eile, who caused the Box of Dimma to be gilt, died about the middle of the 12th century and was succeeded by his son. Maolroona O'Carroll or O'Cearbhaill, King of Eile, was succeeded by his brother. Donald O'Carroll, who was King of Ely at the coming of the English under Strongbow and from him are descended the Principal houses of this family. Maolroona O'Carroll, whose daughter Grace, or Grania, was married to Ulick Burke, Lord of Clanrickard, and was mother of Rickard Sassanagh Burke, the first earl, joined with O'Brien and others against the English Government and gave them much trouble. He died A.D. 1532. His son Fergonamuin or Ferdinando O'Carroll, who succeeded his father as O'Carroll, concluded a treaty with Leonard, Lord Gray, Lord Deputy of Ireland, 12 June 1538, by which he consented for himself and his successors, the O'Carrolls, Capitanci de Ely O'Carroll, to pay the King 12d. for every carucate of land in Ely O'Carroll, one hundred and twenty marks on the nomination of the chief, and on general hostings to supply the Chief Governor of Ireland with twelve horsemen and twenty four foot men, all well equipped for war with provisions for forty days at the expense of O'Carroll; that on all journeys to those parts, they should supply the Lord Deputy and suite with provisions for three days; that the Lord Deputy should be supplied with provisions by O'Carroll for eighty gallowglasses for three months every year and be permitted to make a road or roads through Ely O'Carroll at his pleasure. In 1548 Teige Caoch O'Carroll, son of Ferdinando, called by Sir James Ware, petty King of Ely, routed the English out of his country, but afterwards submitted and was created Baron of Ely in 1532 (I have not been able to find the record of this patent) which he did not long enjoy, having been slain by his own Sept headed by his own kinsman and competitor Cahir O'Carroll, who was afterwards slain by William Adhar O'Carroll, younger brother of Teige, who was knighted 30 March 1567 and made Governor of Ely and Captain of his Nation by Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Justice of Ireland. Sir William died 28 April 1579. His natural son Sir Cahir or Charles O'Carroll, was knighted by Sir John Perrott, Lord Deputy in 1584. Sir Mulrooney O'Carroll, son of Sir William, was knighted by Sir George Carew, L. D. of Ireland, at Dublin Castle, St. James's Day, 1 March 1603, being the day of the Coronation of King James I. Roger O'Carroll, son and heir of Sir Mulrooney, was ousted out of his Estates by Cromwell, he having attached himself to the King's party under the Duke of Ormond, but his eldest son and heir, Charles O'Carroll, was in great favour with Kings Charles II and James the I, who were not able to restore him to his paternal estate; the latter made him grants of large tracts of land on the Monoccasy River in the Province of Maryland in the North America, which was divided into three manors of each and called after the possession he had lost in Ireland, viz., Ely O'Carroll and Doughoregan. The third was called Carrolston. This gentleman was also made Attorney General of the Province and his Estates are still in the possession of his grandson, Charles O'Carroll of Carrolston, Esq. aged 90 years, whose father and himself have been members of the Senate of that State. Mary, the daughter of the last mentioned Charles, was married to Richard Caton Esq., of the State of Maryland, by whom she was mother to her Excellency Marianne, the present Marchioness of Wellesley and three other daughters Elizabeth, Louisa-Catharine (Lady Harvey) and Emily. Sir James Carroll, who was Mayor of Dublin, was knighted by Sir Arthur Chichester, Lord Deputy at Loghroer, the 30th of September 1609. His father, Thomas O'Carroll, being oppressed by the chief of his family, came to live in Dublin. Sir James Carroll had a grant of the Abbey of Baltinglass and was ancestor to the present High Sheriff of the County of Wicklow, Henry Griffiths (Carroll) of Ballymore Esq. Donagh, or Denis O'Carroll, descended from Donogh O'Carroll, brother to Mulrooney O'Carroll, Chief of his name, who died in 1532, was possessed of the estates of Modereeny and Buolybrack in Tipperary and was ousted by Cromwell. He married O'Kennedy's daughter and had thirty sons, who he formed into a troop of horse and presented to Duke of Ormond for the service of King Charles I. On the Restoration, John, his son, had a grant of his lands at Killury in the Co. of Galway, where he married the daughter of O'Crean by Margaret, the daughter of Lord Athenry. His eldest son James Carroll, was ancestor to the family at Killury; Daniel O'Carroll, his second son, entered into the military service of the King of Spain and was made a Knight of the Order of Saint Iago. He was afterwards, through the interest of the Duke of Ormond, made a Lieutenant- Colonel in the British Service by Queen Anne, in which he rose to the rank of Lt. General, obtained permission to bear the Insignia of the Order of St. Iago in England, had also the style of Sir Daniel and was Colonel of a Regiment of Horse. His grandson, John Whitley O'Carroll, was British resident at Saxe Weimar in 1804. Three other O'Carrolls, John, Donagh and Kedagh, obtained grants of land in Connaught from King Charles II in compensation for their losses in Leinster. From them are descended the families of Springhill, Tirlogh, Ardagh, Carragh and Dunmore in the Co. of Galway; Forthill in the County of Mayo and Doraville in the Co. of Clare. The other principal families now existing are those of Emmell in the King's County; Thurles, Ballingarry, Nenagh, Littlefield and Annemead in Tipperary; Rockfield in the Co. of Wicklow and Coolroe in the Co. of Carlow. John Carroll of Stephen's Green, Esq., late M.P. for New Ross is the representative of this last family. Owen Carroll represented the King's Co. in King James's Parliament in 1689. Contemporary Chief dispute A few of the other families which resided within the kingdom of the O'Carrolls were the O'Meaghers/O'Meachair (Maher), O'Caseys, O'Haras, and O'Garas. All of these family surnames, and related septs, also trace their origins to Cian, or Cianachts but many dispute the notion of an overarching Clan Cian. In MacLysaght‚Äôs definitive work Irish Families there are over 200 Irish surnames listed and while recognising that there are many more Irish names it is now considered that these names constitute the main name bearing Irish septs. Many of these septs developed out of larger groups or clans which predated the development of surnames as in the case of O‚ÄôBrien in relation to the Dal C√°s or O‚ÄôHiggins in relation to the Cen√©l Fiachach or in this case O'Carroll in relation to the Cianachta. However, these larger groupings seldom gave rise to surnames in themselves. Specifically in the case of Munster The Great book of Irish Genealogies compiled between 1645 ‚Äì 66 by Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh and edited more recently by Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le (2003), in Vol. II the following pre-surname population groups are listed: Eoghanacht pp 549‚Äì599 D√°l Cais pp 599‚Äì633 Dealbhna pp 633‚Äì645 Clanna C√©in p. 645 = Clan Cian Clann Tadch Meic C√©in pp 647‚Äì661 = Clan Tadch son of Cian S√≠ol Luighdheach meic √çochta pp 661‚Äì683 About The Cianachta - Clan Cian Clan Cian was founded and recognized by the late F. J. O'Carroll, of √âile O'Carroll, Chief of the Name. Fredrick Arthur O'Carroll, has since assumed the mantle of Chief of the Name with the backing of his Council of Chieftains. Chief Fred, descends from the ancient Kings and Princes of √âile O'Carroll. The Kingdom of √âile (Ely) resides in the heart of south-central Ireland. The O'Carroll is a recognized member of the Standing Council of Irish Chiefs and Chieftains. Not all of the current recognized Chiefs on the Standing Council live in Ireland, The O'Carroll, the Chief of Clan Cian, currently resides in the United States. The name Cianachta in Irish means \\"of the Race of Cian,\\" and so, Clan Cian in modern English. The Cianachta were recognized as a racial group in ancient Ireland and now called again to assemble as a clan in these modern times. We are dedicated to the preservation of the √âile O'Carroll Territory including the Kingdom of √âile and the O'Carroll family and all related families histories. The clan represents the O'Carroll/Carroll families and also includes of all the related, family septs, dependent family septs of √âile O'Carroll and other parts of Ireland, and worldwide. Clan Cian has an appointed Council of Chieftains and Clan Officers that preside over certain designated regional areas appointed by The O'Carroll, Chief of √âile O'Carroll and Clan Cian. Historically according to Edward McLysaght the first Chief Herald of the newly formed Republic of Ireland, the term \\"clan\\" or \\"clanne\\" in Ireland refers to the people living within a certain territory, whereas in Scotland a clan is composed of people of a specific family. In ancient Ireland, the old kingdom of √âile O'Carroll (√âile Ui Cearbhaill) included many family surnames that you find today. Of those families, the powerful O'Carrolls were kings, overlords, and later chiefs of their people. A few of the major families related by blood to the O'Carrolls, which lived within the Kingdom of √âile O'Carroll were the O'Meaghers, O'Caseys, O'Haras, and O'Garas. All of these family surnames and other related septs, are members of the Clan of Cian - the Cianachta. Maryland A branch of the Carrolls moved to Colonial Maryland and were prominent Roman Catholics. They played a formative role in the foundation of the United States of America as Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed the United States Declaration of Independence. First cousins of Charles Carroll of Carrollton were Daniel Carroll, who signed the Articles of Confederation and the U.S. Constitution, and Daniel's brother, the Bishop John Carroll, who was the first Bishop and Archbishop of the United States and Founder of Georgetown University. A distant cousin of this branch of the Carroll family was Charles Carroll (barrister), a convert to Anglicanism. Other notable Carrolls were Brigadier General Samuel S. Carroll, Thomas King Carroll and daughter Anna Ella Carroll, and James Carroll. The Carrolls of Maryland have also intermarried with the \\"Blenheim branch\\" of the Lee family of Virginia. In addition to these individuals, the Mitchell family of Maryland claim descent from the aforementioned Charles Carroll of Carrollton through the line of their founding matriarch Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson who, in addition to being a descendant of his, is revered today as one of the earliest and most prominent of the leaders of the civil rights movement. The Carroll family are famed for the number of beautiful homes and manors they have built across Maryland. Most famous is Doughoregan Manor, which remains a family seat in the possession of descendants of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who is buried there. Another early residence of this branch of the family was the Carroll House of Annapolis.The Charles Carroll House of Annapolis official site The later Homewood House was the birthplace of Governor John Lee Carroll, and is now a part of Johns Hopkins University.Johns Hopkins University Museums official site Mount Clare, built by Charles Carroll the Barrister, a distant cousin of the Carrolls of Doughoregan Manor, is the oldest extant Colonial era structure in Baltimore City.Mount Clare Museum House official site A partial, summarized pedigree of the Carroll family: * Domhnall O'Carroll, King of √âile (Ely) * D√≥nal Dhearg (the Red) O'Carroll * William √Ålainn (the Handsome) O'Carroll * Donogh O'Carroll * Teige O'Carroll * Donough O'Carroll * Anthony O'Carroll * Daniel O'Carroll of Aghagurty and Litterluna (1642-1688) ** Charles Carroll the Settler, (1660-1720) *** Charles Carroll of Annapolis, (1702-1782), Land sold to lay-out the town of Baltimore, 1729 **** Charles Carroll of Carrollton, (1737-1832), member of Continental Congress, last surviving signer of Declaration of Independence (1776), first U.S. Senator from Maryland.
