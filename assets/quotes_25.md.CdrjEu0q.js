Following the outbreak of the Greek uprising against the Ottoman Empire in March 1821, Athens fell into Greek hands on 28 April without a fight. Its garrison and Muslim inhabitants, along with the Greek population's leaders as hostages, retired to the Acropolis, which served as the garrison commander's residence. The initial Greek force, some 600 Athenians led by Meletios Vasileiou, was soon augmented by volunteers from Aegina, Hydra, Cephallonia and Kea to ca. 3,000, and maintained a loose siege of the fortified hill. A handful of Ottoman soldiers managed to break through the siege, and went to Karystos in Euboea to request the aid of the local governor, Omar Bey, and of the general Omer Vrioni. The two Ottoman leaders united their forces and descended on Attica. The Greek rebels scattered before them, and the Ottoman forces entered Athens on 20 July. Vrioni remained in Attica to pursue the Greek forces, while Omar of Karystos returned to his home province. After Vrioni's departure, however, the siege recommenced. In spring 1822, the Greek forces were reinforced with artillery commanded by French Philhellenes, under Olivier Voutier, who began a bombardment of the fortress. The Ottoman garrison surrendered on 9 June 1822 (O.S.).  Aftermath = Terms of surrender  After nearly a year of being under siege, the Ottoman garrison at the Acropolis fortress surrendered on June 9, 1822. The terms of surrender were as follows: * The Ottoman troops and civilians would be given free passage to Asia Minor on foreign ships not aligned with Greece * Allow the Turks who wanted to stay in Athens to do so without significant trouble or harassment  Instances of violence  The general Omer Vrioni was known to have a habit of going on 'Greek hunts' to chase and kill Greek civilians. In response to these acts, Greek soldiers stationed in Athens retaliated by killing nearly half of the Ottomans who surrendered following the siege. Various other acts of retribution occurred usually involving the killing of Albanian civilians.  Footnotes  References and further reading  * David, Brewer (2011).

He played a significant part in developing British infantry fighting tactics in the Second World War. Early years The son of Maurice Wigram, Lionel Wigram was born in Sheffield and later moved to Surrey, becoming a London solicitor and property developer. Wigram was educated at King Edward VII School in Sheffield from 1918 to 1925 and The Queen's College, Oxford.Obituary in KES Mag March, 1944 He was married to Mrs. Olga Wigram n√©e Jokelson and the couple had a daughter, Denia. She was the first wife of Peter Palumbo, the property developer.Burke's Peerage 107th Edition, Page 3191 Second World War In 1939, like many thousands of his contemporaries, Lionel Wigram joined the British army at the outbreak of the war. Already commissioned in the Territorial Army, he went on active duty and was commissioned as a Captain into the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment). He was among the founders of the 47th (London) Infantry Division School of Battle Drill in 1941, and was appointed chief instructor at the new GHQ Home Forces Battle School at Barnard Castle early in 1942. Promoted Major, he was then assigned to the 5th Army Corps deployed in Italy. After the Italian capitulation of 1943 British and American troops quickly conquered Sicily and moved up the Italian mainland. The British and Commonwealth Army advanced on the Italian east coast, while the Americans had the west. However, by winter 1943 the advance was at a standstill at the Gustav line, in central Italy. While in the Abruzzi region, Lionel Wigram quickly sympathized with Ettore Troilo, the Italian partisan leader, and successfully helped him to achieve the goal of having Italian paramilitary force fighting with the Allied Forces against the Germans. At the time the Italian forces were still viewed as a potential source of problems, and although they were officially won to the cause the Allied had little or no confidence in them. Therefore, he managed to overcome the diffidence of the British and American Military leaders who had in mind to use Italian troops (regular or partisans) as auxiliary forces. This resulted in the creation of the Volunteer Corps of the Maiella Brigade. The joint military force of British and Italian was nicknamed \\"Wigforce\\". Major Lionel Wigram was killed in action while leading the Wigforce during the hapless attack at Pizzoferrato village in the Abruzzi region; he is interred at Moro River Canadian War Cemetery (XVI.B.9 Camp) in Ortona. Wigram's Theory At the outbreak of the Second World War British Army battle drill, developed during the First World War and revived by the then Lieutenant-General Harold Alexander in I Corps after Dunkirk, was the method of teaching infantry minor tactics. Wigram played the leading part in spreading this training technique to the whole of the Home Army. While studying his troops he concluded that on average a British Army platoon would almost invariably be 25% \\"gutful,\\" men who would go anywhere and do anything, 50% \\"sheep,\\" men who would follow closely behind if well led, and about 25% \\"cowards,\\" who quickly ran or became ineffectual once the fighting started. Legacy Lionel Wigram (born 1961) the British film producer and screenplay writer based in Los Angeles was named after his paternal grandfather, Maj Lionel Wigram.

Following the fall of Missolonghi in western Greece, Athens and the Acropolis remained the only strongholds in Greek hands in mainland Greece outside the Peloponnese. Consequently, after his victory at Missolonghi, the Ottoman commander-in-chief, Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha, turned against Athens. The siege began in August 1826, and followed closely the experience of Missolonghi: the Ottomans set up a very close blockade and bombarded the hill, while the besieged harassed them with frequent night sorties and mining, utilizing the expertise of Konstantinos Chormivitis, who had already distinguished himself in Missolonghi. The Beleaguered Greeks were resupplied and reinforced by small detachments sent through the Ottoman lines by the main Greek army, under Georgios Karaiskakis, which had established itself around Eleusis, Piraeus and Phaleron to the south of Athens. The Greeks launched various attacks against the Ottoman army's rear and its supply lines, most notably the victory at the Battle of Arachova in November ; this strategy was altered in favour of direct attacks on the Ottoman army, resulting in the Battle of Kamatero in February. The command was transferred from Karaiskakis to the British general Richard Church in April. The Ottoman victory at Phaleron (Analatos) on 24 April (Julian) 1827 ended any possibility for relief, and the Acropolis garrison surrendered a month later. 1820s in Greece Conflicts in 1826 Conflicts in 1827 Military history of Athens Acropolis 1826 Acropolis of Athens 1826 in Greece 1827 in Greece 1826 in the Ottoman Empire 1827 in the Ottoman Empire 19th century in Athens Central Greece in the Greek War of Independence ","title":"Siege of the Acropolis (1826‚Äì27)"},{"id":"36088964","text":"Matthew Kilpatrick (8 December 1873 - 13 January 1949) was an Australian politician.

Cheong-na International City is built on a nearly two million square foot plot of land (5.38 million Korean pyong) that expects a maximum population of 90,000. Being developed in the center of international business and leisure, the city boasts an excellent coastal location that links Yeongjong Island and Incheon International Airport to Seoul via the Incheon International Airport Expressway, the Kyeong-in Expressway, the Incheon International Airport Railroad, and the Kyeong-in Ferry Line.  Amenities  Among the city's first international complexes are GM Korea's Research and Development center, the only international school in Korea to be recognized as a domestic educational institution, the Cheong-na Dalton School, and Jack Nicholas' Bear's Best golf club ‚Äî the world's third- ranking golf course after Summerlin and Atlanta. Additionally, the city has scheduled other ambitious projects such as the iconic 450 meter-high CC Tower, the largest domestic lake park in Korea, an international business and finance center, a high-tech industrial complex, Robot Land Theme Park, an international science and research complex, a floral park, U-ECO City and Holy Land. Hana Financial Group is planning to transfer its headquarters here to what will be called Hana Dream Town, and the expectation of a Shinsegae shopping complex is rising after the signing of agreements. Also, directly adjacent to the western industrial park, LG Group is aiming to construct its next- generation electric vehicle research facility by the end of 2012. Cheongna International City is also famous for educational aspects. The famous Cheongna Dalton School which is a foreign school, is also located in Cheongna. Cheongna International City features many convenience facilities for residents, such as the 'Clean Net' automated high-tech waste disposal system. It is among the very few cities in Korea to have this infrastructure. The system consists of a disposal container that opens if a tag on the trash bag is scanned on the built-in scanner. The disposed items are sucked into underground pipes with vacuum technology, and transported automatically to commercial landfills. Other amenities include the Cheongna Central Lake Park, which provides a link around the whole city. It is the hub for Cheongna's leisure and recreational activities. Cheongna International City boasts many high-tech and eco-friendly amenities.

The ElectraFlyer-X was introduced at AirVenture in 2009. The aircraft is intended to be supplied as a kit for amateur construction or as a complete ready-to-fly aircraft.Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 45. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485XTacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 46. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. By February 2017 the design was no longer featured on the company website. Design and development The ElectraFlyer-X was designed to comply with the US light- sport aircraft (LSA) rules. The current LSA rules do not allow any powerplants except reciprocating engines for Special-LSAs (S-LSAs), but Fishman hopes that the rules will be amended in time. In the meantime the aircraft can be constructed in the Experimental - Amateur Built or Experimental-LSA (E-LSA) categories. The aircraft features a cantilever low wing, a two-seats-in-side- by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single electric engine in tractor configuration. The ElectraFlyer-X is made from composites. Its long span wing features a high aspect ratio for aerodynamic efficiency. The engine is an Electric Aircraft Corporation brushless, liquid-cooled powerplant designed specifically for the aircraft. The engine is driven by air-cooled battery packs that are fitted in stainless steel boxes and can be installed in either the engine compartment or the cabin. The batteries will permit flights of up to three hours duration. In 2015 the projected price for a kit, less batteries, was to be US$65,000. The batteries were estimated to add US$15,000 to the cost. In April 2010 the aircraft's first flight was predicted for May or June 2010. Series production was originally intended for 2010 and then delayed to 2011. By June 2012 there was no indication that the design had actually flown or that it would be produced in the near future. In June 2012 the company website listed it only as \\"coming soon\\", however the aircraft's description page had been removed. The US Federal Aviation Administration indicates that the prototype aircraft, N600EL, was registered on 15 July 2009 and had its registration cancelled on 31 May 2012. Fishman has indicated that the late 2000s recession caused development of company products to be delayed. In 2011 Fishman said, \\"The recession has made this not a great business right now\\".

Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA). In D.W. Springer & A. Rubin (eds.), Substance abuse treatment for youth and adults (pp. 109‚Äì201). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. The goal of A-CRA is to improve or increase access to social, familial, and educational/vocational reinforcers for adolescents to achieve and sustain recovery. That is, therapists assist adolescents with learning how to lead an enjoyable and healthy life without using alcohol or other drugs.Hunt, G.M., & Azrin, N.H. (1973). A community-reinforcement approach to alcoholism. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 11, 91‚Äì104. doi:10.1016/0005-7967(73)90072-7 The treatment manual describes an outpatient curriculum that is intended for adolescents (ages 12 to 17) and young adults (ages 18‚Äì25). with DSM-5 alcohol and/or other substance use disorders.

To address the adolescent's needs, goals for treatment, and reinforcers, clinicians select from 19 A-CRA procedures (e.g., communication skills, problem-solving, and participation in positive social activities), all with the goal of improving life areas and supporting abstinence from alcohol and other drugs.Godley, S.H., Garner, B.R., Smith, J.E., Meyers, R.J., & Godley, M.D. (2011).

Clinicians practicing A-CRA are trained in all 19 procedures and complete an extensive certification process. A-CRA has been widely implemented in the U.S., Canada,Dave Smith Youth Treatment Centre.

Together first with his brother and then with his nephews, Nicholas was the co-ruling Count of Holstein-Rendsburg from 1340 until his death. In 1390 Nicholas and his nephews inherited Holstein-Kiel, which itself included former Holstein-Pl√∂n through reversion in 1350. So except of Holstein-Pinneberg Nicholas and his nephews had united all of Holstein. He was also co-ruler of Schleswig from 1375 to 1386. He was thus a leading member of the House of Schauenburg and an influential figure in the area north of the Elbe. He was the second son of Count Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg and his wife, Sophia of Werle. He ruled Schleswig jointly with his elder brother Henry II from 1375 to 1384, thereafter alone. In 1386, he abdicated as Duke of Schleswig in favour of Henry II's son Gerhard VI of Holstein-Rendsburg, who was confirmed as Gerhard II as Duke of Schleswig by King Olaf II of Denmark.Jansen 1778, pp. 740-741 In 1354, he married Elisabeth, the daughter of Duke William II of Brunswick and L√ºneburg, Prince of Lunenburg.

However, the engagement was broken off for political reasons in 1363 and Haakon married Queen Margaret I of Denmark instead. Nicholas died in 1397 and was buried in Itzehoe. His nephew Gerhard VI acted as guardian for his underage daughter Elisabeth. After Nicholas' death his co- ruling nephews Albert II and the elder Gerhard VI partitioned Holstein- Segeberg as a secundogeniture for Albert from Holstein-Rendsburg.

Based in Adelaide, South Australia, 70% of its turnover is generated from software deployed in the mining and bulk material handling sectors. History The company was set up in 2005 by four academics who were also experienced business people, all recent immigrants to Australia. The team was headed by ex-Ernst and Young consultant Matthew Michalewicz, who had moved to Adelaide in 2004 after selling his last company, NuTech. The other three partners were Zbigniew Michalewicz Ph.D, Martin Schmidt and Constantin Chiriac, all four of which were co-authors of the book Adaptive Business Intelligence¬Æ. The company first developed an optimization and predictive modeling platform based on Artificial Intelligence, and then built its supply chain applications for planning, scheduling, and demand forecasting on this platform. Early customers included Orlando Wines, ABB Grain, the Fosters wine brands and later Pernod Ricard that were also located in the Barossa Valley region. In 2008, Rio Tinto Iron Ore asked the company to improve its mining planning and scheduling operations based at Pilbara. SolveIT succeeded in applying its advanced planning and scheduling product, based on non-linear optimization, to the Rio Tinto mine scheduling problem, after many other vendors had failed over a period of ten years. With 30 employees at this point, it then won an additional contract in the mining sector with BHP Billiton/Mitsubishi Alliance Coal, leading to subsequent tender wins in the sector, including: BHP Billiton; CBH Group; Fortescue Metals Group, Hills Holdings, Pacific National Coal; and Xstrata Coal. On 3 September 2012, SolveIT announced it was acquired by Schneider Electric, a global specialist in energy management.http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schneider- electric-acquires-solveit-software-168332406.html Operations Headquartered in Adelaide, the company has over 150 staff based across operational offices in: Melbourne; Brisbane; Perth; and Chi≈üinƒÉu, Moldova. The company develops advanced planning and scheduling business optimisation software, which helps manage complex operations using artificial intelligence. Most of the products were initially developed around the key South Australian industries of wine and grain handling, and today SolveIt has a specialist mining division due to early adoption of the company's software within the mining market. The software helps companies accurately predict and plan their production, supply chain, shipping and currency hedging. Due to the scientific optimisation components embedded in the company's software products, it sometimes uses a prize-based system to recruit the required high-level of talent. In 2011, the company used a Magic square problem, won by University of Nottingham graduate Yuri Bykov, who developed a program which solved a constrained version of a 2600 by 2600 magic square within a minute. In 2011, the company won the Australian National iAward in the e-Logistics and Supply Chain category for its Supply Chain Network Optimiser (SCNO). In February 2012, SolveIT and Schneider Electric became co-organisers of the Integrated Planning and Optimisation Summit, held at the Adelaide Convention Centre. Products/Services *Advanced Planning & Scheduling (APS): Enterprise software for optimising complex planning and scheduling activities, especially those that are heavily constrained or require multi-stage processing.

It was directed by Harry Winer. The film first aired on CBS network on March 14, 1993. The film was based on the true story of a loving husband who is terrorized by the violent behavior of his wife. Background The original broadcast of Men Don't Tell was seen in 18.3 million homes, ranking third among the week's prime time broadcast, behind ABC's Home Improvement and CBS's 60 Minutes. After the original airing, the film was never rebroadcast on over-the-air television, reportedly because it incurred the wrath of several women's groups. However, the film was later shown a number of times on cable's Lifetime network. In 1994, Peter Strauss was nominated for a Golden Globe award for \\"Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV\\".https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107553/awards In the book Abused Men: The Hidden Side of Domestic Violence by Philip W. Cook, the film's producer Nancy Bein was interviewed about the film, which she believed the reaction of the film was the greatest of all relating issues to abused men. Bein stated: \\"I decided to do this movie because a friend, who is a psychologist, told me about a client who was a police officer and who had been a victim of domestic violence.\\" In relation to the script writing, Bein said: \\"We made a very conscious effort to make sure the man was very masculine, because a number of people when they heard about the subject felt that the man must be very wimpy.\\" Speaking of the film's casting, she stated: \\"Judith Light said yes immediately. Peter Strauss was our second choice. Our first choice was an actor who said he was very offended that we sent him the script. He was angry at his agent for soliciting the script and forwarding it to him for him to read. Peter Strauss, a very bright man, accepted and did a very good job.\\" Speaking of the reception, Bein stated: \\"CBS was very high on the movie. They saw it as very high concept because it was one movie that hadn't been done before. They turned out to be right, as it did very well. It did very well overseas as well. It was one of the highest-rated movies of the year. Out of some 300 two-hour movies, I think it was rated number four, so it did extremely well. A lot of the reaction was that people turned it on with the idea of just to watch a few minutes but ended up being compelled to watch the whole movie and feeling very differently by the time it was finished.\\" Plot Ed MacAffrey, a loving husband and father, is terrorized by the violent behavior of his wife, Laura. He tolerates this not only because he loves her and is concerned over the welfare of his children, but also because men are traditionally regarded as weaklings if they allow themselves to be battered by their wives. After one of Laura's destructive tantrums brings the attention of the police, Ed is suspected of being the aggressor. Finally, Laura goes too far when she physically assaults the couple's young daughter Cindy (who did nothing more than tell Laura to stop yelling), and Ed intervenes to protect her - whereupon Laura crashes through the front window of her home and is rendered comatose. As a result, Ed is arrested for domestic violence and attempted murder. As he is interrogated, he tells his story of years of abuse, and how he even once sought help by calling a domestic violence hotline, only to get scorned and hung up on. This interrogation takes all night, by highly skeptical police. While this is going on, his children have been taken to the home of Ed's father Jack, himself a retired police officer, to spend the night. In the morning, Cindy, who chose to remain silent through the years of abuse due to the humiliation and shame, asks her grandfather if her mother was in trouble. This surprises Jack, who asks her why she thought her mother, whom he thought was the victim of his abusive son, would be in trouble? To this, she says, \\"For being so mean to Daddy all the time, and yelling, and breaking things, and hitting us and stuff\\". Shocked, Jack brings Cindy to the police station and after she shares everything with the arresting officers, Ed is released from custody while Laura is herself charged with assault and battery. Not long after Laura emerges from her coma, Ed serves as best man for the wedding of his best friend, Chuck. After giving his toast, Ed is approached by Laura, who learns that both he and the kids have moved in with Jack, then attempts to make excuses for her past behavior. When that fails, she threatens to take the kids and accuses Ed of making everyone else more important than her, but he sets Laura straight, informing her that he'll do anything necessary to protect their children and while he did love her, no matter how much he tried to give, it was never enough for Laura and he can't do it anymore. Laura then asks Ed what he's going to tell people about why they're splitting; after a long pause, Ed responds \\"the truth\\" and walks away.

Light's vicious, insecure wife is a harrowing portrait, although ultimately, to the actress's credit, touched with sympathy. Her bleak image in the movie's last scene is shattering under the fine direction of Harry Winer. And Strauss' pummeled husband - whose wife flails him with sudden, sharp fists that are so realistic they make you flinch - is a study of a warmly masculine man who is no wimp, and no wife hitter, either.\\" Matt Roush of USA Today called the film \\"violent, unsettling and sympathetically acted.\\" John J. O'Connor of The New York Times praised the leads for their \\"searing\\" performances. Tom Shales of The Washington Post praised the film and Light as \\"superb at bringing out the pathos as well as the hostility in this character.\\" Rick Marin of Variety wrote \\"Here's a new one for TV movies: husband-battering.

MAM is found in cycad seeds, and causes zamia staggers. It selectively targets neuroblasts in the central nervous system. In rats, administration of MAM affects structures in the brain which are developing most quickly. It is an acetate of methylazoxymethanol. MAM animal models=Schizophrenia In rat models, the specific effect of MAM on neural development depends on the gestational age of the subject. At the seventeenth gestational day (GD17), administration of MAM produces behavioral and histopathological patterns found in schizophrenia. The molecular mechanism behind this model is not fully known. Methylazoxymethanol acetate administered at GD17 reduces the thickness of the hippocampus and the thalamus. The locomotor effects of amphetamines and the spontaneous firing rate of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area are increased. In alternating maze tests, GD17 MAM rats quickly learned the first rule, but took longer to accommodate to alterations to the rule; this is thought to indicate deficits in working spatial memory, which is also impaired in schizophrenia. Another study found that mice whom methylazoxy-methanol acetate was administered on 16th gestational day, but not those whom it was adminitred on GD17 showed decreased parvalbumin expression in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and schizophrenia-like characteristics. Mice whom MAM was administered on GD16 also exhibited reduced size of hippocampus and thinning of the prefrontal cortex. PFC-dependent cognitive deficits were shown only in male MAM-treated mice. Epilepsy Exposure to MAM before birth increases susceptibility to epileptic seizures caused by flurothyl. Prenatal MAM exposure in rats results in a model of brain malformation. In some MAM animals, video-EEG monitoring has documented the presence of spontaneous electrographic seizure activity In some epilepsy rat models, MAM is administered at the fifteenth gestational day. Previous studies have found impaired cognitive function in GD15 MAM rats, and a reduced seizure threshold. At the cellular level, dysplastic hippocampal neurons in the MAM model were shown to have reduced potassium current function and expression for the Kv4.2 channel subunit These findings may contribute to the spontaneous seizures and reduced seizure thresholds seen in this model.

Additionally, Sunni clerics had tremendous influence over government and their authority was central to the regulation of the economy. Despite all this, the Sultan also had a right to the decree, enforcing a code called Kanun (law) in Turkish.

Until the mid-1990s, both codes were strictly amateur. The highest level of Gaelic Football remains amateur, whereas rugby union now offers professional and semi-professional levels of competition. Players have successfully made the transition to top levels in both codes, and because rugby union is played at the professional level, there is a financial lure for players to switch from Gaelic football to rugby union. A small number have made the journey the other way. Both codes are organised on an all-Ireland basis, with provincial bodies. Rugby union has a number of set pieces, such as line-outs, scrums and rucks that do not have direct equivalents in Gaelic football. Gaelic football aims at a more open kind of play, and as such falls between rugby and soccer. Pitch Both codes use rectangular grassed fields however the Gaelic football pitch has a larger area. A Gaelic football pitch is 130‚Äì145 metres long and 80‚Äì90 metres wide and are marked at distances of 13 m, 20 m and 45 m from each end-line whereas the Rugby field is as near as possible to a maximum of 144m long by 70m wide. with a maximum of 100m between the two try lines. Another key difference is the goal posts. Rugby union posts consists of two posts with a crossbar but without a net, whereas Gaelic football consists of two posts with crossbar and a net. The area above the crossbar is used for scoring in both codes, however, only in Gaelic football is the area underneath the posts used for scoring kicks. The goal posts in Gaelic football are narrower and the crossbar is lower.  Ball  The obvious difference is the ball used. Rugby union uses an oval ball (a prolate spheroid), somewhat similar to an American or Australian rules football. This makes a difference in the variety and style of kicking. Rugby union is capable of producing a diverse range of kicking styles. Gaelic football uses a round ball similar to a football (i.e., soccer ball) or volleyball. The round ball can be kicked anyway you like, inside, outside and middle of your boot. The instep is the most popular style based on culture, the drop punt used in Gaelic is a far superior kick in terms of distance and accuracy but is rarely taught. It is made of 18 stitched leather panels, with a circumference of , weighing between when dry. It may be kicked or hand passed. A hand pass is not a punch but rather a strike of the ball with the side of the closed fist, using the knuckle of the thumb. Duration The majority of adult Gaelic football and all minor and under-21 matches last for 60 minutes, divided into two-halves of 30 minutes, with the exception of senior inter-county games which last for 70 minutes (two-halves of 35 minutes). Draws are decided by replays or by playing 20 minutes of extra time (two-halves of 10 minutes). The under-12s have a half of 20 minutes or 25 minutes in some cases. Half-time lasts for about 15 minutes. A rugby union game is divided into two-halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower-grade games) separated by a half time period of up to 15 minutes in an international match. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball becomes dead ‚Äì any occurrence that would have play restart with a scrum or line-out, or when a team scores. This has led to some 'nail-biting' finishes where teams losing by only a small margin work their way towards scoring, and games can go on several minutes over time. The clock is also stopped during substitutions and for injuries, so the referee does not need to add stoppage time. Advancing the ball In both games, players must dispose of the ball correctly, by hand or by foot. Gaelic football deems the open hand tap to be legitimate disposal. Unlike Gaelic football, rugby union has an offside rule. In rugby union, it is illegal to throw (pass) the ball in a forward direction: a player in a position to receive such a pass would in most cases be offside anyway. Tackles and blocks Rugby union allows full tackling above the knees and below the shoulders, whereas Gaelic football explicitly disallows tackling. Rugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The attacker must also attempt to wrap his or her arms around the player being tackled: merely pushing the player being tackled to ground with a shoulder is illegal. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not \\"ram\\" into the formation without first binding to the players. The level of tackling allowed in Gaelic football is more robust than in association football, but less than rugby union. Shoulder to shoulder contact and slapping the ball out of an opponent's hand are permitted, but the following are all fouls: * Blocking a shot with the foot * Pulling an opponent's jersey * Pushing an opponent * Sliding tackles * Striking an opponent * Touching the goalkeeper when he/she is inside the small rectangle * Tripping * Using both hands to tackle * Wrestling the ball from an opponent's hands Gaelic football allows \\"shepherding\\" or blocking, limited to use on players in possession of the ball. Blocking is illegal in rugby union. Penalties In Gaelic football the penalties available (in increasing order of severity) are: *free kicks (loss of possession) *distance penalties (often in multiples of 13 metres) *penalty kicks *black card (for cynical fouls and dissent, player ejected from the game with a replacement allowed) *yellow card (cautioning a player, similar to association football (soccer)) *red card (player ejected from the game without replacement, similar to association football (soccer)) Scoring Rugby union is played between two teams ‚Äì the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a try, scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a drop goal each score 3 points. The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years. In Gaelic football, if the ball goes over the crossbar, a point is scored and a white flag is raised by an umpire. A point can be scored by either kicking the ball over the crossbar, or by fisting it over in which case the hand must be closed whilst striking the ball. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a goal, worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised by an umpire. A goal can only be scored by kicking the ball into the net, not by fist passing the ball into the net. However, a player can strike the ball into the net with a closed fist if the ball was played to him by another player or came in contact with the post/crossbar/ground prior to connection. The goal is guarded by a goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format Goal Total-Point Total. To determine the score-line goals must be converted to points and added to the other points. For example, in a match with a final score of Team A 0‚Äì21 Team B 4‚Äì8, Team A is the winner with 21 points, as Team B scored only 20 points (4 times 3, plus 8). Players There is no goalkeeper in rugby union, instead there is a fullback, although it must be said that the fullback in rugby union is not required to guard a goal in the same way that a goalkeeper does. A rugby union fullback generally fields the long range kicks, and makes long range attacks. Both codes have a maximum of 15 players per side on the field at any one time. Origins Michael Cusack, one of the founders of Gaelic Athletic Association Both sports have their origins in the traditional football games of Europe, with a great deal of formal 19th century codification overlaying them. Gaelic Football was codified by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1887. It is thought Gaelic football is thought to have originated with the ancient Irish game of caid. The codification of Gaelic football was partly in response to the growing popularity of Association football and rugby in Ireland. The code of football later known as rugby union can be traced to three events which occurred in England: the first set of written rules in 1845, the Blackheath Club's decision to leave the Football Association in 1863 and the formation of the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The code was originally known simply as \\"rugby football.\\" It was not until a schism in 1895, over the payment of players, which resulted in the formation of the separate code of rugby league, that the name \\"rugby union\\" was used to differentiate the original rugby code. Michael Cusack one of the founders of the Gaelic Athletic Association had been known as a rugby player in Ireland, and was involved with the game at Blackrock College and Clongowes Wood College. Cusack was a native Irish speaker and had been concerned with the decline of indigenous Irish football codes. Cusack, along with others codified Gaelic football in 1887. Interaction between the two codes Rugby union grounds are used for many other sports, including rugby league, American football and Gaelic football. Rugby union is also notable for promoting the British and Irish Lions, a selection of players from Britain and Ireland rugby team. Rule 42 (Rule 5.1 in the 2009 rulebook) prohibits the use of GAA property for games with interests in conflict with the interests of the GAA referred to by some as \\"garrison games\\" or foreign sports. Current rules state that GAA property may only be used for the purpose or in connection with the playing of games controlled by the association. Sports not considered 'in conflict' with the GAA have been permitted. On 16 April 2005 the GAA's congress voted to temporarily relax Rule 42 and allow international Association Football and Rugby to be played in the stadium while Lansdowne Road Football Ground was closed for redevelopment. The first soccer and rugby union games permitted in Croke Park took place in early 2007, the first such fixture being Ireland's home match in the Six Nations Rugby Union Championship against France. Croke Park floodlights in use during a Six Nations Championship: at previous points in Irish history it was against GAA rules for Gaelic football and rugby union to be associated, as they were seen as rival codes In January 2006, it was announced that the GAA had reached agreement with the FAI and IRFU to stage two Six Nations games and four football internationals at Croke Park in 2007 and in February 2007, use of the pitch by the FAI and the IRFU in 2008 was also agreed. These agreements were within the temporary relaxation terms, as Lansdowne Road was still under redevelopment until 2010. Although the GAA had said that hosted use of Croke Park would not extend beyond 2008, irrespective of the redevelopment progress, fixtures for the 2009 Six Nations rugby tournament saw the Irish rugby team using Croke park for a third season. 11 February 2007 saw the first Rugby Union international to be played there. Ireland were leading France in a Six Nations clash, but lost 17‚Äì20 after conceding a last minute (converted) try. Raphael Ibanez scored the first try in that match; Ronan O'Gara scored Ireland's first ever try in Croke Park. A second match between Ireland and England on 24 February 2007 was politically symbolic because of the events of Bloody Sunday in 1920. There was considerable concern as to what reaction there would be to the singing of God Save the Queen, which was being used as the anthem of the England team. Ultimately the song was sung without interruption or incident, and applauded by both sets of supporters at the match, which Ireland won by 43‚Äì13 (their largest ever win over England in rugby). Rule 27, sometimes referred to as The Ban, banned GAA members from taking part in or watching non-Gaelic games. Punishment for violating this rule was expulsion from the organisation and it remained in place from 1901 until 1971. During that time people such as Douglas Hyde, GAA patron and then President of Ireland, were expelled for attending a soccer international. To circumvent the ban members such as Moss Keane would commonly adopt a false name. The last person to be suspended from the GAA for violating Rule 27 was Liam Madden, an architect and member of Longford GAA in 1969http://www.thephoenix.ie/phoenix/subscriber/library/volume-29/issue-15/contents.pdf International competition An international rules football match in Melbourne, between Australia and Ireland Rugby union has been an international game since 1871, when beat at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. entered international competition in 1875, and have played matches continuously ever since. The Rugby World Cup itself is of much more recent origin, dating back to 1987, when invitations were sent out to various national sides. Entry has been through qualifying rounds ever since. Gaelic football is mostly domestic, although it remains popular in areas with major Irish emigre populations. Although the game is formally organised outside Ireland, there are no true national Gaelic football teams. However, Gaelic footballers do participate in one form of international competition ‚Äì international rules football. This is a compromise code between Gaelic football and Australian rules football, so is strictly speaking not Gaelic football, although an Irish national side is picked for it. The earliest game of the International Rules Series was in 1984. These were prefigured by an Australian tour of Ireland in 1967 organised by Harry Beitzel, which played against domestic sides.

It is also described as a farmhouse and lairds house. Along with its boundary wall, the castle was designated as a Category A listed building in 1971. History The estate was owned by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart between 1526 after the forfeiture of Stirling of Keir and his beheading for treason in 1540. Its history after that date is unclear, but it may have been owned in the late 16th century by Captain James Stewart of Ochiltree in East Ayrshire who may also have built it. By 1610 it had returned to the Stirlings. At the time of an 1816 survey, the Ochiltree estate was owned by Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery and stretched between two parishes, Linlithgow parish and Ecclesmachan parish. Description The castle is a three-storey L-plan building with an attic. It has circular bartizans on the second-storey level in the south east and north west angles. The entrance was originally in the interior angle in the north wall, adjacent to the circular stair turret. About 1610 it was extensively remodelled with a new doorway in the western face that opened on a porch; two finialed pediments over the doorway display the monograms of Sir Archibald Stirling of Keir and his wife Dame Grizel (n√©e Ross) Stirling. A new strait staircase that ran along the western wall was added to connect the ground and first storeys. The northern wing was extended to include a new kitchen on the ground floor and the old kitchen was partitioned. A new west range of two- storey offices was also added, although this was later replaced in the late 19th century with a long single-storey wing, probably incorporating parts of the previous structure in its southern wall, with one block projecting south east.

The Icelandic Reformation ended with the execution of J√≥n Arason, Catholic bishop of H√≥lar, and his two sons, in 1550, after which the country adopted Lutheranism. Background=Reformation in Denmark- Norway King Christian III of Denmark was a Lutheran Christian III became king of Denmark in 1536.

Lutheran influence in Iceland Luther's influence had already reached Iceland before King Christian's decree. The Germans fished near Iceland's coast, and the Hanseatic League engaged in commerce with the Icelanders. These Germans raised a Lutheran church in Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur as early as 1533.

Oddur's New Testament was printed in Roskilde in 1540, and is the oldest preserved printed work in the Icelandic language. Another of these German-educated young men was Gissur Einarsson, who was secretly in favour of religious reformation. In 1539, bishop √ñgmundur, who was almost blind now, made him his successor, and Gissur was consecrated bishop while √ñgmundur still lived. The old bishop came to regret his decision when his prot√©g√©'s Lutheran views surfaced. However, he was at this point very old and infirm, and could do little to stem Gissur's influence, although he nominally shared the see with him. Bishop √ñgmundur seized Modern-day church at H√≥lar In the spring of 1541, Danish soldiers under the command of Christoffer Huitfeldt landed in Iceland, arrested √ñgmundur and took him to Denmark. He died in Danish custody in 1542.J√≥n R. Hj√°lmarsson, History of Iceland: From the Settlement to the Present Day, (Iceland Review, 1993), p. 71. Gissur was now free to introduce Lutheran religious reforms unopposed, but did not make the progress he had hoped for. Not all Icelanders were happy with the reforms, and the see of H√≥lar remained firmly Catholic. The Danish king and his emissaries did not immediately move against Catholic bishop J√≥n Arason, who still controlled his seat at H√≥lar. In the ensuing years, Iceland remained divided into Protestants and Catholics, but Gissur and J√≥n Arason kept the peace.J√≥n R. Hj√°lmarsson, History of Iceland: From the Settlement to the Present Day, (Iceland Review, 1993), p. 72. J√≥n Arason fights back When Protestant bishop Gissur Einarsson died, J√≥n Arason made his move. He was the last remaining Catholic bishop in the Nordic countries, and he intended to reintroduce Catholicism. J√≥n rode to Sk√°lholt to occupy it and oversee the election of a new bishop. However, the people at Sk√°lholt were prepared for the attack, and after a five-day siege, J√≥n was forced to give up and ride away. J√≥n brought about the election of abbot Sigvar√∞ur Halld√≥rsson in √ûykkvab√¶r as bishop of Sk√°lholt, and sent him to Denmark to be consecrated. This was refused. Sigvar√∞ur died abroad in 1550, after adopting Lutheranism. Instead Marteinn Einarsson, the preferred candidate of the Lutherans, was consecrated as Gissur's successor in Copenhagen.J√≥n R. Hj√°lmarsson, History of Iceland: From the Settlement to the Present Day, (Iceland Review, 1993), p. 72. Marteinn returned to Iceland in 1549. J√≥n then sent his sons, Ari and Bj√∂rn, to arrest him. They brought him to H√≥lar, where he remained in custody throughout the following year. In the spring of 1550, J√≥n travelled to Sk√°lholt, where he exhumed and desecrated the corpse of bishop Gissur, denouncing him as a heretic. J√≥n Arason and his sons beheaded In the summer of 1550, J√≥n rode to the Althing, where he marshalled enough support to pass a decree that Icelanders should readopt the Catholic faith. He and his sons arrested many leading Lutherans, forcing them to readopt the Catholic faith or else flee the country. J√≥n now controlled almost all of Iceland's religious establishments, except for the churches in the hands of P√©tur Einarsson, brother of bishop Marteinn, and Da√∞i Gu√∞mundsson of Sn√≥ksdalur, the bishop's brother-in-law, who was loyal to the king, and had been entrusted with capturing J√≥n Arason.J√≥n R. Hj√°lmarsson, History of Iceland: From the Settlement to the Present Day, (Iceland Review, 1993), p. 73. That autumn, J√≥n and his sons rode west to Dalir with the aim of getting Da√∞i under their power, either through coercion or compromise. They stopped in Sau√∞afell for a few days, during which Da√∞i gathered many men and overpowered them in a brief struggle known as the Battle of Sau√∞afell. They were taken to Sk√°lholt, but fears that they might be rescued by Catholic Icelanders resulted in a speedy beheading for all three on November 7, 1550.J√≥n R. Hj√°lmarsson, History of Iceland: From the Settlement to the Present Day, (Iceland Review, 1993), p. 73. Legacy of the Icelandic Reformation=Catholicism outlawed and Danish rule strengthened With Lutheranism securely in place, Catholicism was outlawed, and all Catholic church property was seized by Iceland's secular rulers. The lands belonging to the Icelandic churches fell into the hands of the King of Denmark, and the commercial influence of Danes and the Danish crown in Iceland greatly increased, culminating in the Danish- Icelandic Trade Monopoly enacted in 1602 and abolished in 1854.J√≥n R. Hj√°lmarsson, History of Iceland: From the Settlement to the Present Day, (Iceland Review, 1993), p. 75-76. Criminal punishment became harsher and enforcement of laws stricter, when a set of laws known as St√≥rid√≥mur passed in 1564.M√°r J√≥nsson. ‚ÄûHva√∞ er St√≥rid√≥mur? ‚Äú. V√≠sindavefurinn 23.8.2004. . (Dated 7.5.2010). Although Latin remained the official language of the Lutheran Church of Iceland until 1686, and a good part of the former Catholic terminology and other ceremonial externals were retained, the Lutheran church differed considerably in doctrine. Those Catholics who refused to convert eventually fled, many of them to Scotland. No Catholic priest was permitted to set foot on Icelandic soil for more than three centuries. Catholicism in Iceland today The Catholic Church resumed missionary activities in Iceland from the 1850s and onwards, and as of January 1, 2015, there were 11,911 members of the Roman Catholic Church in Iceland, an estimated 80 percent of them foreigners. Landakotskirkja is the cathedral of the Catholic Church in Iceland.

Racing career=2011: two-year-old season Dullahan was slow to show worthwhile form as a two-year-old, being well beaten in minor events at Churchill Downs in June and July. He then moved to Saratoga where he finished second in a maiden race before finishing third in the Grade II With Anticipation Stakes on turf in September. Despite having failed to win in four starts, he moved up to Grade I level for the Breeders' Futurity Stakes at Keeneland. Ridden by Kent Desormeaux he was held up in the early stages before finishing strongly to take the lead near the finish and won by three quarters of a length from Majestic City. He was badly hampered and almost fell in the early stages but recovered well, leading Desormeaux to describe him as a \\"super horse\\". In the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs on 5 November, Dullahan started a 16/1 outsider and stayed on in the straight to finish fourth of the thirteen runners behind Hansen, Union Rags and Creative Cause. 2012: three-year-old season Dullahan made his first appearance as a three-year-old at Gulfstream Park in March, where he finished second to Howe Great in the Grade III Palm Beach Stakes. A month later he was sent to Keeneland to contest the Blue Grass Stakes, in which he was matched against the Eclipse Award winner Hansen for the second time. In front of a record crowd of 40,617 Desormeaux restrained the colt in the early stages before moving him up to overtake Hansen near the finish and win going away by one and a quarter lengths. USA Today described his performance as \\"scintillating\\" and reported that Romans felt that Dullahan was by far his best chance of winning the Kentucky Derby. In the Derby, Dullahan started at odds of 12/1 in a field of twenty. He raced in the middle of the field before being switched to the outside in the straight. He made steady progress to finish third behind I'll Have Another and Bodemeister. Dullahan skipped the Preakness to go straight for the Belmont Stakes on June 9. Following the late withdrawal of \\"I'll Have Another\\", he was made the favorite for the race, but finished fifth behind Union Rags. After a seven-week break, Dullahan returned in the Haskell Invitational Stakes at Monmouth Park in which he finished seventh, behind Paynter. A month later he was tested against older horses in the TVG Pacific Classic at Del Mar Racetrack and won by half a length from Game On Dude in a new track record time of 1:59.54. It was Dullahan's third Grade I win, all of them achieved on a synthetic surface, and gave the colt automatic entry into the Breeders' Cup Classic. Dullahan's two remaining starts as a three-year-old were disappointing: he finished fifth when favorite for the Jamaica Handicap at Belmont in October and then ran ninth, behind Little Mike in the Breeders' Cup Turf. 2013: four-year-old season Dullahan was sent to race in the United Arab Emirates in March 2013 but ran poorly in his two races including the Dubai World Cup in which he finished eleventh of the twelve runners behind Animal Kingdom. On his return to the USA he finished third in the Grade III Arlington Handicap but then finished eighth behind Game On Dude when he attempted to repeat his 2012 success in the Pacific Classic. Dullahan sustained a tendon injury in the Pacific Classic and was retired from racing on October 14. Six days later, the colt suffered a severe attack of colic in his stable. Despite prompt medical attention and surgery he died at 4.45 am on October 20. According to a Facebook post by Dale Romans, Dullahan was regarded my those who knew him as an incredible horse ‚Äì full of personality and talent. \\"Love you, Dullahan ‚Äì our thoughts and prayers are with you, buddy !!

Her greatest successes to date are her results at the 2014 Commonwealth Games where she claimed a silver in the individual pursuit and a gold in the scratch race, which is her first ever gold medal at an international level and her first time being Commonwealth Champion. In addition, she has competed at the National Track Championships with gold medal results at an elite level since 2012 in multiple disciplines. She also has competed at international events, representing in Australia at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships, where she has secured silver medals in the Omnium (2012), Team pursuit (2012 and 2013). Edmondson has also competed in the London 2012 Olympics, securing a bronze medal for Australia in the women's Omnium and finished in fourth place in the Team pursuit. Early life Edmondson was born in Adelaide, but due to her parents' careers at Royal Dutch Shell, she spent the early part of her childhood living in Malaysia, Oman and the Netherlands. However, when she was six, the family returned to her father's native land of Australia. She attended the Victor Harbor Primary School, south of Adelaide, South Australia, later moving to St John's Grammar School in the Adelaide Hills where she took up numerous pursuits, including soccer and athletics. Career When she was 13, the South Australian Sports Institute visited her school and she was identified as having the physical attributes to have a potential career in cycling. After a year in the Talent Search Program, her first major win came at the 2006 National Junior Track Championships where she won two bronze medals in the Under 17 500m Time Trial and Sprint. From that point, she began to specialise in sprint cycling and as a junior won sprint events at a National and Oceania level. In 2010, she took part in her first elite level National Championships finishing with silvers in the Team sprint, Keirin and 500m TT as well as a bronze in the Individual sprint. However, Annette began to lose interest in the sport and took a break from cycling. In spite of her doubt, she returned to training just four months later, but she wanted a change and therefore made the switch from sprint to endurance cycling. Eight months later, she had successfully made the switch by becoming the Australian Omnium and Scratch Race champion. Her first World Championships came in 2012 at the UCI World Championships in Melbourne in which she achieved silver in both the Omnium and Team Pursuit. These results helped her secure a place in the 2012 Australian Olympic Team. In London, she took part in two events of the Olympic Track Cycling Schedule. In the Team Pursuit, the Australian squad secured 4th place, missing out on the bronze medal. It was her effort and performance in the 6 events of the Omnium which resulted in her claiming the bronze medal. After the Olympics, in 2013, she signed a professional road contract with Orica-AIS, in her first season with the team, she secured a major victory taking 1st overall in the Tour of Chongming Island. Her and teammates took 3rd in the 2013 World Road Race Championships TTT in Florence, Italy. At the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Edmondson claimed a silver in the Individual Pursuit along with fellow athlete Amy Cure who took a bronze in the event. On the 3rd day of competition (26 July 2014), Edmondson took part in the 10 km Scratch Race, where she raced to victory taking her 1st Commonwealth Games Gold Medal and again fellow athlete Amy Cure also succeeded coming out with a silver medal from the event. On 22 October 2014, announced that Edmondson had signed with the team for the 2015 season, where she remained until the team disbanded at the end of the 2018 season. Personal life Edmondson has also had an interest in charity work from a young age. Her first recognition of her work came in 2007 in which she became \\"Make Indigenous Poverty History Youth Ambassador for SA\\". Since then, she has made personal visits to deprived areas, such as parts of Indonesia to give up her time as volunteer. She is fluent in Indonesian. Edmondson has two brothers, with Alex also being a member of the Australian track cycling team.

His elder brothers John and Henry Borwin died before 1285, so that he became the sole ruler, initially under the regency of his mother. After several failed attempts by the Lord of Mecklenburg and Werle, the other two Lordships ruled by the House of Mecklenburg, to conquer Rostock, he put his territory under the protection and feudal overlordship of King Eric VI of Denmark. Eric VI successfully defended Rostock; however, he then removed Nicholas from power and took Rostock for himself. In 1311, Lord Henry II of Mecklenburg launched a new attempt to take the City of Rostock. He succeeded on 15 December 1312. When Nicholas died on 25 November 1314, the Lordship of Rostock initially fell to Denmark. Nicholas was buried in the Dominican St. John's monastery in Rostock. Another war broke out between Denmark and Mecklenburg. Henry II conquered the rest of the Lordship of Rostock. In a peace treaty between Henry II and King Christopher II of Denmark signed on 21 May 1323, Henry was given the Lordships of Rostock, Gnoien and Schwaan as hereditary Danish fiefs and Rostock ceased to exist as a separate principality.

The flaps are smaller than the intake manifold and therefore allow air to pass around them even when \\"closed\\". The photo shows a cleaned swirl flap removed from the intake manifold of a BMW M47TU 2-litre diesel engine. The flap itself is made from stainless steel and secured to a spindle by two small Torx screws. The sealing O-ring and external actuating lever can be seen below the flap itself. Operation Swirl flap position is adjusted by an electrical or vacuum- actuated servo mechanism which is under the control of the engine management system. In a typical implementation the flaps will be closed at idle speed, creating additional turbulence in the intake. As engine speed increases, the flaps are gradually opened until, at around 2,000 rpm, they are parallel to the airflow and present virtually no resistance. Their purpose is to ensure that the air entering the cylinder is sufficiently turbulent for good fuel-air mixing even at low engine speeds. This aids in reducing certain toxic emissions and may also improve low-end power and torque. Disadvantages The disadvantages of swirl flaps are mainly associated with fouling by exhaust gas recirculation, which leaves tarry deposits on the flaps and the inside of the intake manifold. Over time the flaps can begin to stick in one position and the engine management system may report an error code if the correct flap position cannot be achieved within a few percent of the design specification.

The main feature of video door entry is that it enables the person indoors to identify the visitor and, if (and only if) they wish, engage in conversation and/or open the door to allow access to the person calling.  Equipment  Video door entry consists of both outside and indoor elements: an outdoor panel on the outside, an electronic lock release and an indoor monitor. The outdoor panel or street panel is installed beside the entrance door or gateway and incorporates different elements ready for use in any climate conditions: one or several pushbuttons to make the call (usually one per home or apartment), a micro camera adapted for night vision to capture the image of the caller, a microphone to pick up their voice and a speaker to reproduce the voice of the occupant indoors. A video door entry panel may include push buttons to call the homes or offices and a camera to capture the street scene. The video entry monitor allows the occupant to see who has called, talk to the visitor and open the door. Installed indoors, the monitor consists of a screen showing the image of the person calling, a microphone and earpiece for conversation and a pushbutton to trigger the door lock release. The communication set up is full duplex. The electric door release is a device installed in the door lock and operated from inside the building to lift the latch and clear the way for the visitor.  Common equipment types  thumbnail There are several variations on this basic format. In addition to outdoor panels with one pushbutton per apartment, it is possible to find others with a numeric keypad: in this case, designed for large residential installations, the homes are identified by codes. Others have built-in cardholders panels or even small screens to guide the user or facilitate entry for people with disabilities. Some video entry monitors have an earpiece similar to a telephone handset, while others are \\"hands-free\\". Other examples are monitors with memories which store an image every time someone calls at the door or touchscreen video entry systems.  Classification of video door phone(VDP)  Video door phone can be classified two possible classification : 1\\\\. Security layers : a. Level 1 security ‚Äì This is security layer added by VDP system at the community entrance. This layer is given to the guard who will directly verify the entry of a visitor to the community. Such systems are only at a community level. b. Level 2 Security : This is also known as the lobby security ‚Äì This is to get access to your lobby of the apartment in such a case the visitor will have to dial the number of the flat and then the flat owner allows the access to a visitor from the lobby entrance itself. c. Level 3 security : In this case the visitor communicates with the outdoor camera in front of house door or villa gate. 2\\\\. Technologies & classification : a. Standalone ‚Äì A standalone VDP is a device used in villas or by individual home owners. Types of technology of standalone VDP ‚Äì i. Analog VDP ‚Äì It is an analog display and camera. ii. Connected digital VDP ‚Äì This is a digital LCD display with Digital camera usually with image capture and video capturing ability when the bell is pressed. In this case normally some additional camera integration is also allowed. iii. Wireless video door bell(VDB) : A camera units which gets connected to interned or router and allows communication with ones mobile or tablet top communicate with the visitor. b. Multi-apartment- This is a solution where there is an mass housing scenario. i. Analog Multi- apartment systems ‚Äì This is an Analog VDP providing 3 tier security. ii. IP VDP Multi-apartment system ‚Äì This is IP VDP which is 3 tier security and integration with BMS (Building management system ), Security systems like intrusion , CCTV building security and in most cases even home automation.  Automatic operation  When a visitor presses one of the outdoor panel pushbuttons, the built-in camera is connected and the image captured outdoors appears on the monitor screen. Connection takes place automatically with no need to activate the equipment, which is one of the essential elements of video door entry. As of this point, the person inside the building can open the door if they wish or begin a conversation, which is usually secret (cannot be heard by other users of the same facility). The equipment also disconnects automatically after a set time has elapsed. The video entry system as a whole runs on low voltage energy from the building‚Äôs trunk  Extra functions  Many terminals currently on the market are ready to accept extensions, making the monitor into a small automatic function control centre. From here, the user can view one or several additional cameras installed at other access points, trigger light switches or open a second door, etc.  Video door entry systems with access control  Video door entry systems are commonly found integrated with different access control systems. This means that elements are installed in the same outdoor panel to allow certain previously authorised users to access the premises. The most common means are proximity cards, fingerprint readers, a keypad for secret numbers or even Bluetooth triggered by mobile phone.  Adaptive equipment  Different equipment sets are currently found on the market which make use more accessible for people with different disabilities. So, thinking of the visually impaired, the outdoor panel may include information in Braille alongside the pushbuttons, or a voice synthesiser can also be added which indicates when the door is opened. For people with hearing impairment, the outdoor panel may include a screen with icons signalling the communication status: if the user is calling, if someone is speaking from indoors or opening the door. Also with this type of user in mind, the monitor may be fitted with an inductive loop, an element which interacts with conventional hearing aids to facilitate conversation with the outside without their presence being noticed by other users. The kit also includes visual or audio call alerts.

This article addresses the history of bisexuality in the United States. It covers this history beginning in 1892, which is when the first English-language use of the word \\"bisexual\\" to refer to sexual orientation occurred. 1892 to 1950 Blues singer Bessie Smith had relationships with both men and women (photo by Carl Van Vechten). The first English-language use of the word \\"bisexual\\" referring to sexual orientation was by the American neurologist Charles Gilbert Chaddock in his 1892 translation of the 7th edition of Krafft-Ebing's seminal work Psychopathia Sexualis. Prior to this, \\"bisexual\\" typically referred to reproductive hermaphrodites, especially in botany. Under any label, openly bisexual people were rare in early American life. One notable exception was the openly bisexual poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, who received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver in 1923.Pulitzer site Retrieved December 9, 2010 The 19th century poet Walt Whitman is usually described by biographers as either bisexual or homosexual in his feelings and attractions. In the early 20th century, during the Harlem Renaissance, blues singers Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith made no secret about their relationships with both men and women and songs like \\"Sissy Man Blues\\", \\"Freakish Blues\\" and Rainey's \\"Prove It on Me\\" spoke openly of homosexual and bisexual relationships. Poet Edna St. Vincent Millay was openly bisexual. Early film, being a cutting-edge medium, also provided opportunity for bisexuality to be expressed. In 1914 the first documented appearance of bisexual characters (female and male) in an American motion picture occurred in A Florida Enchantment, by Sidney Drew. However, due to the censorship legally required by the Hays Code, the word bisexual could not be mentioned and almost no bisexual characters appeared in American film from 1934 until 1968. Bisexual Americans were given some visibility in the research of Alfred Kinsey (who was himself bisexual) and his colleagues in the late 1940s and early 1950s; they found that 28% of women and 46% of men had responded erotically to or were sexually active with both women and men. Their research also found that 11.6% of white males (ages 20‚Äì35) had about equal heterosexual and homosexual experience/response throughout their adult lives, and that 7% of single females (ages 20‚Äì35) and 4% of previously married females (ages 20‚Äì35) had about equal heterosexual and homosexual experience/response for this period of their lives.Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, Table 142, p. 499Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, Table 147, p. 651 As a result of this research, the earlier meanings of the word \\"bisexual\\" were largely displaced by the meaning of being attracted to both women and men. However, Kinsey himself disliked the use of the term bisexual to describe individuals engaging in sexual activity regardless of gender, preferring to use \\"bisexual\\" in its older, biological sense of reproductive hermaphrodites, saying, \\"Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his [sic] anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual\\" (Kinsey et al., 1948, p. 657). 1966 to present=1960s Stephen Donaldson, aka Donny the Punk, founded Student Homophile Leagues at Columbia and New York University in 1966. LGBT political activism became more prominent in this decade. The first public protests for equal rights for gay and lesbian people were staged at governmental offices and historic landmarks in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. between 1965 and 1969.LGBT Civil Rights, UW Madison . Housing.wisc.edu (1969-06-28). Retrieved on 2010-11-30. In DC, protesters picketed in front of the White House, Pentagon, and the U.S. Civil Service Commission. One woman at the second White House picket of those protests, J.D., identified herself as a bisexual. In 1966 bisexual activist Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk) founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group. Activism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow, especially in San Francisco. One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967. Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual. Due to this, bisexuals began to be included in the facility's programs for the first time. The Stonewall Rebellion, considered the beginning of the modern LGBT rights movement, occurred at the Stonewall bar in 1969. Bar patrons, including bisexuals, stood up to the police during a raid. In commemoration of this, the next year the first LGBT pride march was held. Bisexual activist Brenda Howard is known as the \\"Mother of Pride\\", for her work in coordinating the first LGBT Pride march, and she also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around Pride Day which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June.Channel 13/WNET Out! 2007: Women In the Movement The Gay Pride Issue: Picking Apart The Origin of Pride Additionally, Howard along with the bisexual activist Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk) and gay activist L. Craig Schoonmaker are credited with popularizing the word \\"Pride\\" to describe these festivities.Dynes, Wayne R. Pride (trope), Homolexis Donaldson, Stephen (1995). \\"The Bisexual Movement's Beginnings in the 70s: A Personal Retrospective\\". In Tucker, Naomi (ed.). Bisexual Politics: Theories, Queries, & Visions. New York: Harrington Park Press. pp. 31‚Äì45. . Bisexual activist Tom Limoncelli later stated, \\"The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.'\\"In Memoriam ‚Äì Brenda Howard 1970s Bisexuals became more prominent in the media in the 1970s. In 1972 bisexual activist Don Fass founded the National Bisexual Liberation group in New York City, which issued The Bisexual Expression, most likely the earliest bisexual newsletter. In 1973 bisexual activist Woody Glenn was interviewed by a radio show of the National Organization for Women on WICC in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 1974, both Newsweek and Time Magazine ran stories on \\"bisexual chic,\\" bringing bisexuality to mainstream attention as never before. In 1976 the landmark book View from Another Closet: Exploring Bisexuality in Women, by Janet Mode, was published. Bisexual 1970s icon Lou Reed Bisexuals were also important contributors to the larger LGBT rights movement. In 1972, Bill Beasley, a bisexual activist in the civil rights movement as well as the LGBT movement, was the core organizer of the first Los Angeles Gay Pride March. He was also active with the Gay Liberation Front. In 1975, activist Carol Queen came out as bisexual and organized GAYouth in Eugene, Ore. In 1977 Alan Rockway, a psychologist and bisexual activist, co-authored America's first successful gay rights ordinance put to public vote, in Dade County, Florida. Anita Bryant campaigned against the ordinance, and Rockway began a boycott of Florida orange juice, which she advertised, in response. The San Francisco Bisexual Center also helped sponsor a press conference with lesbian activists Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, and pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock, in opposition to Bryant. Bisexual activist Alexei Guren founded the Gay Teen Task Force in Miami, Fla., in response to Bryant's campaign. The Florida Citrus Commission canceled her contract as a direct response to this pressure. In 1979, Dr. Marvin Colter and John Soroczak co-founded Arete, The Bisexual Center of Southern California, in Whittier, CA, a support and social group for bisexuals, which marched in the 1982 Los Angeles Gay pride. John Soroczak, a psychotherapist, facilitated the first bisexual rap group at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center in 1994. Also in 1979 A. Billy S. Jones, a bisexual founding member of the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays, helped organize the first black gay delegation to meet with President Jimmy Carter's White House staff. Jones was also a core organizer of the 1979 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, and ‚ÄúThird world conference: When will the ignorance end?,‚Äù the first national conference for gay and lesbian people of color. The bisexual movement had its own successes as well. Most notably, in 1972 a Quaker group, the Committee of Friends on Bisexuality, issued the ‚ÄúIthaca Statement on Bisexuality‚Äù supporting bisexuals. The Statement, which may have been \\"the first public declaration of the bisexual movement\\" and \\"was certainly the first statement on bisexuality issued by an American religious assembly,\\" appeared in the Quaker Friends Journal and The Advocate in 1972. In 1976 Harriet Levi and Maggi Rubenstein founded the San Francisco Bisexual Center. It was the longest surviving bisexual community center, offering counseling and support services to Bay Area bisexuals, as well as publishing a newsletter, The Bi Monthly, from 1976 to 1984. In 1978, bisexual activist Dr. Fritz Klein introduced the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid in his book The bisexual option: A concept of one-hundred percent intimacy, in which he examined the incidence and nature of bisexuality, the attitudes of bisexual persons, and the rewards of bisexuality. Bisexual activism also began to spread beyond the coasts, as from 1978 until 1979, several Midwestern bisexual groups were created, such as One To Five (founded by Scott Bartell and Gary Lingen for Minneapolis/St.Paul, Minn), BI Women Welcome in Minneapolis, The BI Married Men's Group in the Detroit suburbs, and BI Ways in Chicago. 1980s San Francisco Pride 1986 In the 1980s AIDS began to affect the LGBT community, and bisexual people took an important role in combating it. In 1981 bisexual activists David Lourea and Cynthia Slater presented safer-sex education in bathhouses and BDSM clubs in San Francisco. Also in 1981, bisexual activist Alexei Guren, on the founding board of the Health Crisis Network (now CareResource) in Miami, Fla., began outreach and advocacy for Latino married men who have sex with men. In 1984, David Lourea finally persuaded the San Francisco Department of Public Health to recognize bisexual men in their official AIDS statistics (the weekly \\"New AIDS cases and mortality statistics\\" report), after two years of campaigning. Health departments throughout the United States began to recognize bisexual men because of this, whereas before they had mostly only recognized gay men. Bisexual activists also fought for the recognition of women in the AIDS epidemic. From 1984 until 1986, bisexual activist Veneita Porter, of the Prostitute's Union of Massachusetts and COYOTE (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics), advocated for women, transgender people, and injection drug users with AIDS. In 1985, Cynthia Slater, who was HIV-positive, organized the first Women's HIV/AIDS Information Switchboard. This sort of activism was particularly important for bisexuals as they were often blamed for spreading AIDS to their heterosexual partners. For example, in 1987, Newsweek portrayed bisexual men as \\"the ultimate pariahs\\" of the AIDS epidemic, and bisexual activist and person with AIDS Alan Rockway of BiPOL was quoted speaking against the stereotype. An October 1989 Cosmopolitan magazine article that stereotyped bisexual men as dishonest spreaders of AIDS led to a letter- writing campaign by the New York Area Bisexual Network (NYABN). Cosmopolitan has printed no articles defaming bisexuals since the campaign. Robyn Ochs helped establish the bisexual history archives in 1987. The bisexual movement enjoyed some important firsts during the 1980s. The Boston Bisexual Women's Network, the oldest existing bisexual women's group, was founded in 1983 and began publishing their bi-monthly newsletter, BI Women. It is the longest- existing bisexual newsletter in the US. Also in 1983, BiPOL, the first and oldest bisexual political organization, was founded in San Francisco by bisexual activists Autumn Courtney, Lani Ka'ahumanu, Arlene Krantz, David Lourea, Bill Mack, Alan Rockway, and Maggi Rubenstein. In 1984, BiPOL sponsored the first bisexual rights rally, outside the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. The rally featured nine speakers from civil rights groups allied with the bisexual movement. Also in 1984, the First East Coast Conference on Bisexuality (which was also the first regional bisexual conference in the US) was held at the Storrs School of Social Work at the University of Connecticut, with about 150 people participating. Participants in the conference then founded the East Coast Bisexual Network in 1985, which later was renamed the Bisexual Resource Center (BRC) in 1993. In 1987, the East Coast Bisexual Network established the first Bisexual History Archives with bisexual activist Robyn Ochs' initial collection; archivist Clare Morton hosted researchers. Also in 1987, the Bay Area Bisexual Network, the oldest and largest bisexual group in the San Francisco Bay Area, was founded by Lani Ka'ahumanu, Ann Justi and Maggi Rubenstein. In 1988, Gary North published the first national bisexual newsletter, called Bisexuality: News, Views, and Networking. In 1989 Cliff Arnesen testified before the U.S. Congress on behalf of bisexual, lesbian, and gay veteran's issues. He was the first veteran to testify about bisexual, lesbian, and gay issues and the first openly non- heterosexual veteran to testify on Capitol Hill about veteran's issues in general. He testified on May 3, 1989, during formal hearings held before the U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs: Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. He also testified before the same Subcommittee on May 16, 1990, as part of an HIV/AIDS panel. Bisexual people also continued to be active in the larger LGBT movement. In 1986 BiPOL's Autumn Courtney was elected co-chair of San Francisco's Lesbian Gay Freedom Day Pride Parade Committee; she was the first openly bisexual person to hold this sort of position in the United States. In 1987 a group of 75 bisexuals marched in the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, which was the first nationwide bisexual gathering. The article \\"The Bisexual Movement: Are We Visible Yet?\\", by Lani Ka'ahumanu, appeared in the official Civil Disobedience Handbook for the March. It was the first article about bisexuals and the emerging bisexual movement to be published in a national lesbian or gay publication.http://www.lanikaahumanu.com/OUT%20OUTRAGED.pdf The North American Bisexual Network, the first national bisexual organization, was first thought of at this gathering, though not founded until three years later (see below.) NABN would later change its name to BiNet USA. Also in 1987, Barney Frank became the first U.S. congressman to come out as gay of his own volition; he was inspired in part by the death of Stewart McKinney, a closeted bisexual Republican representative from Connecticut. Frank told The Washington Post that after McKinney's death there was, \\"An unfortunate debate about 'Was he or wasn't he? Didn't he or did he?' I said to myself, I don't want that to happen to me.\\" 1990s Wendy Curry, one of the organizers of the first Celebrate Bisexuality Day in 1999 The oldest national bisexuality organization in the United States, BiNet USA, was founded in 1990. It was originally called the North American Multicultural Bisexual Network (NAMBN), and had its first meeting at the first National Bisexual Conference in America. This first conference was held in San Francisco, and sponsored by BiPOL. Bisexual health was one of eight workshop tracks at the conference, and the \\"NAMES Project\\" quilt was displayed with bisexual quilt pieces. Over 450 people attended from 20 states and 5 countries, and the mayor of San Francisco sent a proclamation \\"commending the bisexual rights community for its leadership in the cause of social justice\\", and declaring June 23, 1990, Bisexual Pride Day. The conference also inspired attendees from Dallas to create the first bisexual group in Texas, called BiNet Dallas. The bisexual movement also became more accepted as part of established institutions. In 1990, Susan Carlton offered the first academic course on bisexuality in America at UC Berkeley, and in 1991, psychologists Sari Dworkin and Ron Fox became the founding co-chairs of the Task Force on Bisexual Issues of Division 44, the gay and lesbian group in the American Psychological Association. In 1997, bisexual activist and psychologist Pat Ashbrook pioneered a national model for LGBT support groups within the Veterans Administration hospital system. Bisexual literature became more prominent in the 1990s. In 1991, the Bay Area Bisexual Network began publishing the first national bisexual quarterly magazine, Anything That Moves: Beyond The Myths Of Bisexuality, founded by Karla Rossi, who was the managing editor of the editorial collective until 1993. 1991 also saw the publication of one of the seminal books in the history of the modern bisexual rights movement, Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak Out, an anthology edited by Loraine Hutchins and Lani Ka'ahumanu. After this anthology was forced to compete (and lost) in the Lambda Literary Awards under the category Lesbian Anthology, and in 2005, Directed by Desire: Collected Poems a posthumous collection of the bisexual Jamaican American writer June Jordan's work had to compete (and won) in the category \\"Lesbian Poetry\\", BiNet USA led the bisexual community in a multi-year campaign eventually resulting in the addition of a Bisexual category, starting with the 2006 Awards. In 1995, Harvard Shakespeare professor Marjorie Garber made the academic case for bisexuality with her book Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life, in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for \\"repression, religion, repugnance, denial, laziness, shyness, lack of opportunity, premature specialization, a failure of imagination, or a life already full to the brim with erotic experiences, albeit with only one person, or only one gender\\". In 1997, bisexual activist Dr. Fritz Klein founded the Journal of Bisexuality, the first academic, quarterly journal on bisexuality. However, other media proved more mixed in terms of representing bisexuals. In 1990, a film with a relationship between two bisexual women, called Henry and June, became the first film to receive the NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). But in 1993, bisexual activist Sheela Lambert wrote, produced, and hosted the first television series by and for bisexuals, called Bisexual Network. It aired for 13 weeks on NYC Public Access Cable. Regional organizations in the bisexual movement also began to have more impact. In 1992 the Bisexual Connection (Minnesota) sponsored the First Annual Midwest Regional Bisexual Conference, called BECAUSE (Bisexual Empowerment Conference: A Uniting, Supportive Experience). That year Minnesota changed its State Civil Rights Law to grant the most comprehensive civil rights protections for bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender people in the country. Minnesota's bisexual community had united with lesbian, gay, and transgender groups to lobby for this statute. Also in 1992, the South Florida Bisexual Network (founded in 1989) and the Florida International University's Stonewall Students Union co-sponsored the First Annual Southeast Regional Bisexual Conference. Thirty-five people from at least four southeastern states attended. In 1993 the First Annual Northwest Regional Conference was sponsored by BiNet USA, the Seattle Bisexual Women's Network, and the Seattle Bisexual Men's Union. It was held in Seattle, and fifty-five people representing Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Montana, and British Columbia attended. An important event in the LGBT rights movement in this decade was the 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation. As a result of lobbying by BiPOL (San Francisco), openly bisexual people held key leadership roles in local and regional organizing for the March, and for the first time bisexuals were included in the title of the March. Also, openly bisexual activist and author Lani Ka'ahumanu spoke at the rally, and over 1,000 people marched with the bisexual group. Coinciding with the March, BiNet USA, the Bisexual Resource Center (BRC), and the Washington, DC-based Alliance of Multicultural Bisexuals (AMBi) sponsored the Second National Conference Celebrating Bisexuality in Washington, DC. Over than 600 people attended from the US and Europe, making it at the time the largest Bisexual Conference ever held. Another important event in the LGBT rights movement was the enactment of the \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" policy. Before the \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" policy was enacted in 1993, bisexuals (and lesbians and gays) were banned from serving in the military. In 1993 the \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" policy was enacted, which mandated that the military could not ask servicemembers about their sexual orientation.Craig A. Rimmerman Gay rights, military wrongs: political perspectives on lesbians and gays in the military, Garland Pub., 1996 p. 249Thompson, Mark. (2008-01-28) 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Turns 15. TIME. Retrieved on 2010-11-30. However, until the policy was ended in 2011 service members were still expelled from the military if they engaged in sexual conduct with a member of the same sex, stated that they were bisexual, gay, or lesbian, and/or married or attempted to marry someone of the same sex.Richard A. Gittins The Military Commander & the Law, DIANE Publishing, 1996 p. 215 Several important surveys concerning bisexuality were conducted around this time. In 1993, Ron Fox authored the first large scale research study on bisexual identity, and established and maintained a comprehensive bibliography on bi research. Also in 1993, The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior showed that 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women considered themselves bisexual. In 1995 BiNet USA Bisexual Youth Initiative, Fayetteville, N.C., developed and mailed a national survey to LGBT youth programs. The survey was published and sent back to agencies, offering assistance to improve services to bisexual youth. In 1992, Colorado voters approved by initiative an amendment to the Colorado state constitution (Amendment 2) that would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to recognize bisexuals or gay people as a protected class. The amendment stated: > Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, > nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school > districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance > or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, > practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or > entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, > quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination. This Section > of the Constitution shall be in all respects self-executing. This led to the 1996 Supreme Court Case Romer v. Evans, in which the Court ruled in a 6‚Äì3 decision that the state constitutional amendment in Colorado preventing protected status based upon bisexuality or homosexuality did not satisfy the Equal Protection Clause. The majority opinion in Romer stated that the amendment lacked \\"a rational relationship to legitimate state interests\\", and the dissent stated that the majority \\"evidently agrees that 'rational basis'‚Äîthe normal test for compliance with the Equal Protection Clause‚Äîis the governing standard\\". The state constitutional amendment failed rational basis review. The concept of bisexual pride became more widespread in the late 1990s. At an LGBT PrideFest in Connecticut in 1997, Evelyn Mantilla came out as America's first openly bisexual state official. The Bisexual Pride flag designed by Michael Page was unveiled December 5, 1998. The first Celebrate Bisexuality Day was organized by Michael Page, Gigi Raven Wilbur, and Wendy Curry in 1999, now observed annually on September 23. 2000‚Äì2010 Bisexual activists in 2009 Bisexual people had notable accomplishments in the LGBT rights movement at this time. In 2001, the American Psychological Association (APA)'s \\"Guidelines on psychotherapy with lesbian, gay and bisexual clients\\" stated \\"homosexuality and bisexuality are not a mental illness\\"; bisexual activist Ron Fox served on the task force that produced the guidelines. In 2002, Pete Chvany, Luigi Ferrer, James Green, Loraine Hutchins and Monica McLemore presented at the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex Health Summit, held in Boulder, Colorado, marking the first time bisexual people, transgender people, and intersex people were recognized as co-equal partners on the national level rather than gay and lesbian \\"allies\\" or tokens. Also in 2002, bisexual activist Robyn Ochs delivered the first bi- focused keynote during the National Association of Lesbian and Gay Addiction Professionals. In 2003, the Union for Reform Judaism retroactively applied its pro-rights policy on gays and lesbians to both the bisexual and transgender communities. In 2005, bisexual scholars and activists mobilized with The Task Force, GLAAD and BiNet USA to meet with New York Times science section editor and researcher Brian Dodge to respond to misinformation the paper had published on a study about bisexual men. The study, entitled Sexual Arousal Patterns of Bisexual Men, by the controversial researcher J. Michael Bailey, allegedly \\"proved\\" that bisexual men did not exist. With little critical examination, various media celebrities and outlets jumped on the band-wagon and claimed to have \\"solved\\" the \\"problem of bisexuality\\" by declaring it to be non-existent, at least in men. Further studies, including improved follow- up research led by Michael Bailey, proved this to be false. Also in 2005, the Queens Chapter of PFLAG announced the creation of the \\"Brenda Howard Memorial Award\\", marking the first time a major American LGBT organization named an award after an openly bisexual person. The National Equality March in Washington, D.C., was held on October 11, 2009, calling for equal protection for bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender people in all matters governed by civil law in all states and districts; a dedicated bisexual, pansexual, and queer-identified contingent was organized as part of the March. Several bisexual groups came together and marched, including BiNet USA, New York Area Bisexual Network, DC Bi Women and BiMA DC.Maria, October 15, 2009. \\"My Experience at the National Equality March\\", Bi Social Network There were also four out bisexual speakers at the National Equality March rally: Michael Huffington, Lady Gaga, Chloe Noble, and Penelope Williams. In October 2009, LGBT activist Amy Andre was appointed as executive director of the San Francisco Pride Celebration Committee, making her the organization's first openly bisexual woman of color executive director.Adrienne Williams, October 19, 2009. Interview with Amy Andre: New Bisexual Executive Director of SF Pride , BiSocial Network. Significant reports about bisexuals were also released in this decade. In 2002, a survey in the United States by National Center for Health Statistics found that 1.8 percent of men ages 18‚Äì44 considered themselves bisexual, 2.3 percent homosexual, and 3.9 percent as \\"something else\\". The same study found that 2.8 percent of women ages 18‚Äì44 considered themselves bisexual, 1.3 percent homosexual, and 3.8 percent as \\"something else\\". A 2007 report said that 14.4% of young US women identified themselves as bisexual/lesbian, with 5.6% of the men identifying as gay or bisexual. Also in 2007, an article in the 'Health' section of The New York Times stated that \\"1.5 percent of American women and 1.7 percent of American men identify themselves [as] bisexual.\\" In 2008 Kate Brown was elected as the Oregon Secretary of State, becoming America's first openly bisexual statewide officeholder. 2010‚Äìpresent In 2011, one of the demands of 2009's National Equality March was met as the \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" policy was ended, allowing bisexuals, lesbians, and gay men in the U.S. military to be open about their sexuality. San Francisco's Human Rights Commission released a report on bisexual visibility in 2011,Bisexual Invisibility: Impacts and Regulations marking the first time any governmental body released such a report. Its findings indicated that self-identified bisexuals made up the largest single population within the LGBT community in the United States. In each of the report's studies, more women identified as bisexual than lesbian, though fewer men identified as bisexual than gay. Also in 2011, a longitudinal study of sexual minority women (bisexual, unlabeled, and lesbian) found that over 10 years, \\"more women adopted bisexual/unlabeled identities than relinquished them\\". Of those who began the study identifying as bisexual, 92% identified as bisexual or unlabeled 10 years later, and 61% of those who began as unlabeled identified as bisexual or unlabeled 10 years later. Capital Pride in Washington DC, June 2014. Oregon Governor Kate Brown was the United States' first openly bisexual governor; she was elected in 2016. In September 2012 Berkeley, California became the first city in America to officially proclaim a day recognizing bisexuals. Alt URL The Berkeley City Council unanimously and without discussion declared Sept. 23 as Bisexual Pride and Bi Visibility Day. In 2013 on Bisexual Pride and Bi Visibility Day, the White House held a closed-door meeting with about 30 bisexual advocates so they could meet with government officials and discuss issues of specific importance to the bisexual community; this was the first bi-specific event ever hosted by any White House. Another important contribution to bisexual visibility came in 2014, when the Bisexual Research Collaborative on Health (BiRCH) was founded to search for ways to raise public awareness of bisexual health issues, as well as to continue high-level discussions of bisexual health research and plan a national conference. As for law and politics, in November 2012 Kyrsten Sinema was elected to the House of Representatives, becoming the first openly bisexual member of Congress in American history. In 2013 BiLaw, the first American national organization of bisexual lawyers, law professors, law students, and their allies, was founded. In February 2015 Kate Brown became the first openly bisexual governor in the United States, upon the resignation of Oregon's chief executive. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5-to-4 vote in Obergefell v. Hodges that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage, legalizing it throughout the United States; this increased the rights of bisexual people in America wishing to marry their same-sex partners. Another important victory came later that year, when the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission concluded that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act does not allow sexual orientation discrimination in employment because it is a form of sex discrimination. In 2016, Kate Brown was elected as governor of Oregon, and thus became the first openly bisexual person elected as a United States governor (and indeed the first openly LGBT person elected as such). In 2018, Kyrsten Sinema became the first openly bisexual person to win a major party nomination to run for a U.S. Senate seat, and later that year she became the first openly bisexual person elected to the U.S. Senate. As well, Kate Brown was re-elected that year as governor of Oregon. In the first large-scale government survey measuring Americans' sexual orientation, the NHIS reported in July 2014 that 0.7 percent of Americans identify as bisexual. A 2016 survey cited by CNN said that bisexuality was increasing in the United States, with 5.5% of women and 2% of men identifying as bisexual compared with 3.9% and 1.2% respectively in an earlier survey. In 2017, the Department of Justice filed an amicus brief in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals making the argument that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination against employees who are bisexual or gay. In 2018 America's first city-wide Bi Pride event was held, in West Hollywood. Notable American bisexuals *Gregg Araki is an independent filmmaker. He is involved in New Queer Cinema.

The event first took place in 1698 to facilitate trading between the Manahoac Tribe of King William County, Virginia and settlers in and around the area that would become the city of Fredericksburg. At the Dog Mart, the Manahoac (and later, the Pamunkey and the Mattaponi) would trade furs and produce for prized English hunting dogs. Though it has not been held continuously since that year, it is the oldest event of its kind in the United States. History In the early 17th century, American colonists raising tobacco in Virginia were concerned that the Native Americans were overhunting game. Gentlemen farmers were having trouble finding game to hunt near their plantations for sport. Until that time, settlers in Virginia had traded and given dogs brought from England to the Native Americans who used them in hunting. In 1619, the Virginia Assembly passed a law forbidding the sale of, \\"...any English dogs of quality as a mastiff, greyhound, bloodhounde, land or water spaniel, or any other dog...\\". The penalty for breaking this law was a fine of 5 shillings. The ban on selling or giving away dogs ended in the late 17th century. The House of Burgesses passed an act in 1677 that provided for the trade of dogs and other items with Native Americans. The act established a \\"marte\\" or \\"faire\\" where, during a truce of several days each year, the settlers and Native Americans traded dogs, livestock, and other goods in the settled areas of Virginia. The first \\"Fredericksburg\\" mart (Fredericksburg was not established as a town until 1728) was likely held within the protection of a fort known as Smith's Fort established below the falls on the Rappahannock in what is now Spotsylvania County. A trading agreement was concluded between the Manahoac tribe and the settlers. As a result of this agreement, and to promote peace, an annual fair was held in Fredericksburg where settlers could trade English hunting dogs for the Native Americans' produce and furs. This annual fair continued until the start of the Revolutionary War when it was stopped because of the settlers mistrust of the Native Americans during the fight for independence. Present day The Dog Mart was not held again until 1927 when the traditional event was known as Dog Curb Market. At that time the event was held at City Park in Fredericksburg. The mart was scheduled for October each year to coincide with the beginning of hunting season in the area. This provided hunters with the opportunity to purchase hunting dogs. At that time the event began to gain nationwide attention. It was the subject of a Pathe Newsreel feature in 1928 and Time magazine featured the Dog Mart in an article in October 1937. In 1938, 7,000 people and 641 dogs attended the event. After a suspension of the Dog Mart during World War II, the event was once again revived in 1948 by the Fredericksburg Chamber of Commerce under the auspices of the local chapter of the Izaak Walton League, a conservation oriented organization. The Dog Mart was held at the Maury School stadium in Fredericksburg. A delegation of 100 Pamunkey Indians from their reservation in nearby King William County and led by Chief T.D. Cook, attended the 1949 Dog Mart. At the event in October 1949, the event drew an estimated 15,000 spectators and participants from 30 states, Canada, Mexico, and England. In 1951, National Geographic Magazine published a 16-page article about the dog mart in the June issue. The event was moved outside the town to a park owned by the Izaak Walton League in the 1970s. In 1980, the Dog Mart was held for the only time without any dogs. The sponsors of the event made the decision to follow the state veterinarian's advice to exclude the dogs due to a canine epidemic. Modern day Dog Marts have featured crafts, Indian events, rides, fiddling and fox-horn blowing contests, as well as a dog parade, show, auctions, and a reenactment of the first Dog Mart. The 2015 Dog Mart featured a Police canine demonstration, archery demonstration, fur trapping exhibition and demonstration by local trappers, children's fishing tournament, large firearm exhibition, barrel train ride, plus a dog show with judging. The Dog Mart celebrated its 317th anniversary in 2015 and continues to be held each year at the Fredericksburg-Rappahannock Chapter of the Izaak Walton League in Spotsylvania, Virginia. It is the oldest such event in United States. The Fredericksburg Dog Mart should not be confused with the Fredericksburg Dog Fair: a former charitable event held in Fredericksburg.

By 1963, their experience allowed them to launch a new intercom, this time designed for apartment blocks or buildings, in other words, an audio door entry system. It was the first to be designed exclusively in Spain and for years remained the only one.

It was a joint venture between NTL and Vivendi Universal who each had a 50 percent share. The Studio was announced on 29 September 2000 amid speculation that some Hollywood-based film studios were planning to launch subscription film channels through BSkyB. Ahead of its launch the channel was subject to analysis from the European Commission, who found that the film service would neither create nor reinforce a dominant position in any market. The basic subscription channel launched on 1 February 2001 on NTL's analogue cable TV platform, followed by digital on 7 February and NTL Ireland's digital platform in January 2002. At its launch The Studio had access to around 1,000 films, with a selection of both classic titles, as well as newer releases. Films included Born on the Fourth of July, Carlito's Way, Babe, Leaving Las Vegas and Shine. Movies would also be packaged into blocks and strands to attract particular viewers. NTL had hoped to launch The Studio on other platforms, such as Sky Digital, ONdigital and Telewest, but its failure to do so meant the channel did not reach the number of viewers a deal with another provider would have allowed. In May 2001, NTL attempted to sell its stake in The Studio in an effort to stem heavy losses, while Vivendi also began to run into trouble. With NTL and Vivendi deciding the channel was not financially viable despite meeting its financial targets, it was announced on 18 December 2002 that The Studio would close at the end of the month. The channel in fact remained on air until the early hours of 1 January 2003, when it closed after almost two years on air. NTL had agreed to provide a guarantee of ¬£4.2 million in the event of termination of the joint venture, with closure costs totalling ¬£4.8 million.

Santopietro also provides a historian's critical analysis of the careers of director Robert Wise and screenwriter Ernest Lehman.Wall Street Journal, February 27, 2015 Santopietro's The Godfather Effect, was a critically acclaimed study of the Godfather films - as well as Mario Puzo's novel - and their effect on American culture.Hollywood ReporterHollywood Reporter According to Santopietro, The Godfather was a turning point in American cultural consciousness. With its emphasis on proud ethnicity, The Godfather changed not just the way Italian-Americans saw themselves, but how Americans of all backgrounds viewed their individual and national self- identities, their possibilities, and attendant disappointments. The \\"Godfather Effect\\" had a broader philosophical dimension, as well. As noted by Santopietro, \\"what Puzo delivered - brilliantly - was nothing less than a disquisition on the madness, glory, and failure of the American dream.\\" Early in the novel, Amerigo Bonasera declares \\"I believe in America.\\" The novel then depicts a nation where Mafia and big business are two sides of the same coin: both are corrupt, tell the truth selectively, and do exactly as they wish. The Godfather Effect was widely reviewed, and well received by the press. The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"a beautiful narrative of the way pop culture shapes our self-image.\\" The Wall Street Journal declared that \\"part memoir, part devotional film essay and part reflection on the meaning of ethnicity in American life, The Godfather Effect defines how the Godfather movies, along with the 1969 Mario Puzo novel from which they were adapted, reflected the madness, glory and failure of the American dream. By exploring that dream in distinctly Italian-American terms, the movies succeeded in delivering nothing less than the Italianization of American culture. In other words, they were so cool that everyone wanted to seem a little Italian.\\" Newsday appreciated the personal dimension in Santopietro's book, noting, \\"In the end, it's the personal moments, such as Santopietro taking his aging dad to revisit the field where he played baseball as a child, that are most rewarding. The films make up the shell of The Godfather Effect, but it's the connections with family that give it a center as sweet as cannoli cream.\\"'The Godfather Effect' by Tom Santopietro That's Life! Over the years, Santopietro developed and produced a succession of cabaret shows which commemorate Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, and other legendary American performers. These shows travelled and sold out all over the United States, and received extensive press coverage including The New York Times. The Best is Yet to Come was a lively yet intimate tribute to the musical legacy of Frank Sinatra. Sentimental Journey: A Tribute to Doris Day, written and staged by Santopietro, was a sparkling collaboration between Santopietro and composer Billy Stritch. The show performed to sold-out audiences all over the U.S. In his latest show, called That's Life!, Santopietro and the noted singer/pianist Tony DeSare saluted the great Italian-American singers Tony Bennett, Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. That's Life! was hailed as \\"an informative, entertaining mix of Santopietro's anecdote-packed mini-bios of the famous singers seguing back-and-forth with DeSare's renditions of classic songs forever associated with the three pop bel canto masters.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official website Year of birth missing (living people) American lawyers American theatre managers and producers Taft School alumni Trinity College (Connecticut) alumni University of Connecticut alumni Living people Italian male writers American people of Italian descent 21st-century American writers ","title":"Tom Santopietro"},{"id":"36091409","title":"Llamada De Mi Ex"},{"id":"36091419","text":"Marcos Ant√≥nio de Sousa Pimenta Machado (born July 8, 1957) is a former Brazilian goalkeeper.

Life Becichemus was an Albanian born in Scutari (Shkod√´r), then part of the Venetian possessions. His father Marino was a secretary of the Republic of Venice at the Ottoman court for about thirty years. His grandfather Pietro was, together with Stefano Ionina, an Albanian ambassador serving in Venice. His mother Bianca Pagnano likely hailed from a Milanese merchant family in Dalmatia. After 1477, with the Ottoman conquest of Scutari, during which his parents were captured by the Ottomans, Becichemus found refuge with his relative in nearby Dulcigno (Ulcinj). He then moved with his relative to Brescia (in Italy), where he learnt Latin and Greek., In 1484, at only 17 years of age, he held a speech in the city in honour of mayor Marco Antonio Morosini. Shortly after this he returned to Dulcigno where he married Caterina, the daughter of Pasquale Dabro, a member of a notable family in that city. The couple had many children. According to ≈†ime Ljubiƒá (1822-1896), the Senate of the Republic of Ragusa in 1492 sent for him and he was appointed the public school rector (at Dubrovnik). At Dubrovnik, he worked with poetry and rhetoric. He wrote a work in 1495 dedicated to the Ragusan Senate. During his year-long stay, he befriended Ragusan humanist and poet Ivan Guƒçetiƒá (1451-1502). He was since October 1496 the secretary of Venetian patrician Melchiorre Trevisan, when the latter was provvedittore of the Venetian fleet based in the polity of Ferdinand II of Naples, and later provvedittore generale in the Duchy of Milan ( September 1499). In Brescia he tutored the son of Girolamo Donato (1495-1497). After receiving Venetian citizenship in 1500, he opened a humanist school. In 1501 he went to Brescia where he worked at the university and printed his first works in Latin, such as Observationum collectanea in primum Historiae naturali librum (1504-1506). In 1503 he published a panegyric to the Venetian Senate concerning the siege. He wrote commentaries on Cicero, Pliny the Elder and other classical philosophers. A couple of years later, he became a professor of rhetoric at the University of Padua. In 1962 his panegyric of 1503 was translated into Albanian and English and included with Marin Barleti's work, The Siege of Shkodra.

Established in 2011 as a collaboration between Yale University and the National University of Singapore, it is the first liberal arts college in Singapore and one of the few in Asia. Yale-NUS is the first institution outside New Haven, Connecticut, that Yale University has developed in its 300-year history, making Yale the first American Ivy League school to establish a college bearing its name in Asia. Yale-NUS is predominantly a four-year, fully residential undergraduate institution. The first class, the class of 2017, consisted of 157 students entering in 2013. At full capacity, the College has 250 students in each class. Students select their majors (currently there are 14) at the end of their second year, after going through two years of the Yale-NUS Common Curriculum, which is \\"built from scratch by the inaugural faculty, draws on the strengths of established liberal arts traditions, while introducing our students to the diverse intellectual traditions and cultures of Asia and the world\\". Students graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours or a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours from Yale-NUS College, awarded by NUS. The College's first graduating class (Class of 2017 ‚Äì excluding those who are still completing their concurrent degree programmes, amongst others) comprises 119 students. 103 students graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours and 16 with a Bachelor of Science with Honours. The top five majors of choice amongst the students were Arts and Humanities; Philosophy, Politics and Economics; Environmental Studies; Psychology; and Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences. As of September 29, 2017, over 90% of the students had secured jobs or university places to pursue graduate studies. Students who received job offers are working in sectors such as science and research (12%), consulting (14%), and the public sector (17%). Others industries include education and engineering, finance, technology and startups, communications, and consumer and lifestyle. About 60% of students at Yale-NUS are Singaporeans and 40% are international students. Yale-NUS College receives more than 8,000 applications annually and the admit rate is usually 3% to 7%. Apart from Singapore University of Technology and Design, Yale-NUS is the only other college in Singapore to follow a holistic admissions process similar to that followed by Yale and other American universities.http://yale-nus.edu.sg History Under the presidency of Richard Levin, Yale University began developing a \\"internationalization\\" strategy that included expanding financial resources for international students and study abroad programs, founding the Yale World Fellows and the Center for the Study of Globalization, and joining the International Alliance of Research Universities. Administrators at Yale began considering international campus expansion in 2006, and initially approached the United Arab Emirates about establishing an arts institute on Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Island, developed in collaboration with the university's arts professional schools. After Yale indicated that it was not willing to offer Yale degree programs at the proposed institute, the project was dropped. alt= Levin and National University of Singapore President Tan Chorh Chuan discussed the concept of a joint liberal arts college at the 2009 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and eighteen months later, Levin and Yale Provost Peter Salovey circulated to the Yale faculty a prospectus for a liberal arts college in Singapore. Among the given reasons for the initiative were \\"develop[ing] a novel curriculum spanning Western and Asian cultures\\" and better preparing students for \\"an interconnected, interdependent global environment\\". Yale-NUS College was officially launched in April 2011. In July 2012, the College held its ground-breaking ceremony; it enrolled its first class of students in 2013. Yale-NUS inaugurated its campus on October 12, 2015. The event was attended by Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Acting Education Minister (Higher Education) Ong Ye Kung and the presidents of Yale and the National University of Singapore. The College held its inaugural graduation ceremony on May 29, 2017. The certificates were presented by Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, President of the Republic of Singapore, and Richard Levin, former President of Yale and Chief Executive of Coursera, was the guest speaker. The guest speaker for 2018's graduation ceremony was Professor Kishore Mahbubani, Senior Advisor (University & Global Relations) and Professor in Practice of Policy at the National University of Singapore. For 2019‚Äôs graduation ceremony, Dr Noeleen Heyzer, Social Scientist and Former United Nations Under-Secretary-General, was the guest speaker. In 2012, Yale- NUS published its policy on academic freedom and non-discrimination, which states that ‚Äúthe College upholds the principles of academic freedom and open inquiry, essential core values in higher education of the highest calibre. Faculty and students in the College will be free to conduct scholarship and research and publish the results, and to teach in the classroom and express themselves on campus, bearing in mind the need to act in accordance with accepted scholarly and professional standards and the regulations of the College.‚Äù The College is also ‚Äúcommitted to basing judgments concerning the admission, education, and employment of individuals upon their qualifications and abilities.‚Äù Leadership and faculty= Leadership  * President, Professor Tan Tai Yong, Professor of Humanities (History) and previously Vice- Provost (Student Life) at National University of Singapore * Executive Vice President (Academic Affairs), Joanne Roberts, Professor of Social Sciences (Economics) at Yale‚ÄìNUS, and previously on the faculty of the University of Calgary. * Executive Vice President (Administration), Kristen Lynas, University of Chicago MBA '90 *Yale-NUS College's Founding President from 2012-2017 was Pericles Lewis, Professor of comparative literature and English at Yale University. Faculty As of April 2020, Yale‚ÄìNUS lists over 140 faculty members from leading colleges and universities around the world. Governing board The governing board is composed of trustees half- appointed by Yale, and half-appointed by NUS. The board is chaired by Mdm. Kay Kuok Oon Kwong. Admissions alt= Admission to Yale-NUS will be based on each student‚Äôs prior achievement and promise for success at the College. Yale- NUS has a financial aid programme, which offers substantial support for students from a variety of backgrounds. Fees are cohort-based and individual circumstances will be considered in the financial aid application process. The admission timeline is similar to that of colleges and universities in the US. Yale-NUS targeted a class size of around 250 students; this threshold was met with the Class of 2022. Application deadlines are typically in January and March. At full capacity, the total expected student population will be 1,000 students. The College employs a holistic approach in evaluating applicants: while academic achievement as reflected in examinations grades is a primary consideration, interviews, recommendations, essays and extracurricular accomplishments are also given significant weight in the process. Inaugural class (Class of 2017) In all, Yale-NUS attracted more than 11,400 applications from over 130 countries. The acceptance rate of the inaugural class was under 4%. making the admission process comparable in selectivity to both Yale University and the most competitive faculties of National University of Singapore, and making it one of the most selective colleges in the world, as compared to Harvard (5.9%), Stanford (5.1%) and Columbia (6.9%). According to a press-release by the Yale-NUS College Administration, the overall yield rate was 52% comparable to top liberal arts colleges in the US such as Amherst (41%), Williams (45%), and Bowdoin (48%), as well as not far off from Ivy League schools and top universities like Brown (58%), Cornell (52%), Columbia (61%), Harvard (81%), Stanford (76%) and Princeton (65%). In the fall of 2012, the College began accepting application for the Batch of 2017 from Singapore and the rest of the world. The admissions staff began a series of international recruitment events, spanning North America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Students were allowed to apply through the Common Application, Yale- NUS portal and those who chose to apply to Yale College also had the option to share their application with Yale-NUS. Class profiles Of the 157 students admitted to the class of 2017 (starting in 2013), 87 were female while 70 were male. The median SAT Score was 1440 (on the 1600 scale). The 75th percentile for Critical Reading (CR) is 760/800 and the 75th percentile for Math is 780/800. 26 nationalities from six continents were represented in the first batch. 62% were Singaporean, while the rest were internationals, giving Yale-NUS one of largest international student populations in terms of percentage of total students. Thirty-two of the students were from Asia, Australia and New Zealand, while another 11 were from Europe, Africa, and South America. More than 10% of the student body came from North America with 13 students from the United States and 4 from Canada. The Class of 2018 comprised 177 students from 35 countries. They came from 95 schools on six different continents. By nationality, Singaporeans account for the majority in this intake, with a percentage similar to last year's inaugural class. For international students, the next biggest groups are 10% from the United States, 3% from India, and 3% from South Korea. The Class of 2019 comprised 198 students from 25 countries. Singaporeans continued to make up the largest pool of students in this year's intake, similar to the previous two cohorts. The College's international students came from 25 countries, including for the first time, students from El Salvador, Jamaica and Tunisia. The nationalities in the Class of 2019 that are most frequently represented are the United States, China and India. The Class of 2020 comprised more than 200 students from 40 countries, the highest diversity of student nationalities in a single intake. In 2016, the Yale-NUS student body comprises more than 700 students from 53 countries across 6 continents. A more detailed class profile for the Class of 2020 has not been released, however the admissions rate of 5% was eventually revealed to the Yale Daily News. The Class of 2021 comprised 248 students from 45 countries, its largest intake to date. Singaporeans continued to make up the largest pool of students hailing from 28 schools across Singapore. The College sees the strongest international representation from India, United States, China and South Korea. For the first time, students from Uzbekistan and Paraguay are also represented, amongst others. The Class of 2022 comprised 250 students from 45 countries, its largest intake to date. Singaporeans continued to make up the largest pool of students in, hailing from 28 schools across Singapore. The College saw the strongest international representation from United States, China and India. For the first time, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Costa Rica, Finland, Ireland, Romania, and Ukraine are represented in the student population. The Class of 2023 comprised 246 students from 39 countries. Like previous intakes, majority of students were Singaporeans hailing from 30 schools across Singapore. For this cohort, the College saw the strongest international representation from India, United States, the Philippines and Korea. Acceptance rates have varied between 3 and 7% across the first six batches. Academics alt= The founding instruction committee decided to implement a common curriculum, a set of interlinked courses for all students. Similar to the core curricula at Columbia University and University of Chicago, students get to choose from a number of set courses in their first year of study. The common curriculum is reviewed every four years. Following its inaugural review, the common curriculum was reduced to 10 courses, with the removal of a science course. The Yale-NUS common curriculum is a set of interconnected courses designed to provide all students with a shared, intensive exploration of themes and topics ranging across all the academic disciplines, from science to the humanities. In his book, titled \\"In Defense of a Liberal Education,\\" Fareed Zakaria describes the Yale-NUS Curriculum Report as the 21st century version of the Yale Report of 1828, which set the agenda for the classical curriculum of the 19th century, and the Harvard Red Book of 1945, which set a similar agenda for the 20th. Majors Students choose their majors at the end of their second year. Currently, there are 14 major fields of study. 31% of the courses are part of the common curriculum, 34% are required by the major, and 35% are electives and prerequisites for the major. The majors offered are: * Anthropology * Arts and Humanities * Economics * Environmental Studies * Global Affairs * History * Life Sciences * Literature * Mathematics, Computational and Statistical Sciences * Philosophy * Physical Sciences * Philosophy, Politics and Economics * Psychology * Urban Studies Minors Students can declare their minors after the end of their second year. Currently, there are 13 minor fields of study. The fields correspond to Yale- NUS's existing majors, with the exception of Philosophy, Politics and Economics and the Double Degree Programme with Law. The College also offers two new interdisciplinary minors: Global Antiquity and Chinese Studies. 42% of the inaugural two batches have declared minors. Joint and associated programmes Yale-NUS and Faculty of Law, NUS jointly offer a Double Degree programme in Law and Liberal Arts for those seeking a broad liberal arts education in addition to their professional training in the law. Yale-NUS and the Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore's first US-style graduate-entry medical school, jointly offer the Liberal Arts and Medicine pathway, giving select Yale-NUS students a conditional admission offer from Duke-NUS to proceed to the MD programme directly after the Yale-NUS bachelors programme. Duke-NUS has also expressed interest in admitting Yale-NUS graduates for their PhD and MD/PhD degree programmes. Yale-NUS offers four Special and Concurrent Degree Programmes: *Special Programme with Yale School of the Environment: A six-year programme designed for students who want to pursue careers in an environmental field. *Concurrent Degree Programme with Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy: A five-year programme designed for students who want a broad liberal arts education followed by careers in the field of public policy. *Concurrent Degree Programme with Yale School of Public Health: A five-year programme designed for students who want a broad liberal arts education and a career in the field of public health. *Concurrent Degree Programme with NUS School of Computing: A five-year programme designed for students who want to combine a broad liberal arts education with a strong theoretical and practical foundation in computing. In addition, students will receive special consideration to be admitted in the Silver Scholars Programme of the Yale School of Management. The programme provides the unique opportunity to enter the Yale MBA programme immediately after undergraduate study to move more quickly toward career goals.  Experiential learning  alt= The Yale-NUS Centre for International and Professional Experience integrates traditionally separate and often silo-ed components of experience based learning (such as study abroad, summer sessions, internships, career services, leadership and service programming, research attachments) under one roof. The Week 7 program takes place in the seventh week of the first semester of the first year ‚Äì a time when all freshers are enrolled in the same common curriculum courses. During Week 7, all first-year students participate in a faculty-generated initiative that brings student learning out into the world and connects to both faculty interests and themes of the common curriculum. At Yale-NUS, a term-time study abroad experience is the norm. Some 75 to 80 per cent of students spend a semester elsewhere. Campus life=Residential colleges Elm College, one of three residential colleges at Yale-NUS Yale- NUS's student life is modelled on the residential colleges of Yale. There are three residential colleges named Saga, Elm and Cendana, although there are plans to build a fourth. Each has its own dining hall, courtyard, student suites, sky-gardens, faculty residences, study-spaces, intramural teams, and butteries, informal student-run eateries that are a Yale tradition. Students live in suites of six single rooms that share common space and a bathroom. These small-scale communities are arranged vertically in residential towers, which contain both student suites and faculty apartments. Floors are grouped into neighborhoods, every alternate floor equipped with its own skygarden, a landscaped outdoor space for high-rise buildings that was pioneered in Singapore. The residential community includes a rector (equivalent to the position of a college master at Yale), a vice rector, faculty fellows, advisors, rector's aides, and distinguished visiting fellows. Students will expand their social and leadership skills while enjoying the support of \\"nested academic communities.\\" Kyle Farley, formerly Dean of Jonathan Edwards College at Yale, served as the first Dean of Students of the college. Brian McAdoo, a geologist and expert in environment studies, formerly of Vassar College, served as the inaugural Rector and was rector of Elm college, while Eduardo Lage-Otero, formerly of Trinity College, was named inaugural Vice- Rector and later served as Vice-Rector of Saga College. The Performance Hall Foyer, a popular spot for public events As the first-years transitioned into the collegiate living experience, they were originally aided by Dean's Fellows, a group of recent college graduates picked from various higher educational backgrounds, including Amherst, Carleton, Princeton, Reed, Mt. Holyoke, Yale, and NUS. As of 2017, the Dean's Fellow role changed, with Residential College Advisors providing pastoral care and programmatic organising for smaller groups of first-years and Dean's Fellows providing this for the rest of the student body alongside other institutional work. In 2020, Residential Life Officers (RLOs) were appointed in place of Dean‚Äôs Fellows. The RLOs work full-time on student care, community building and other responsibilities in their assigned Residential College. Student organisations Yale-NUS has over 50 student organisations for students to build on their interests or pursue new passions. The college has a number of student newspapers, magazines and journals. Publications include The Octant, Yale-NUS's most established publication, The Mocktant, its satirical counterpart, T√≤nes, a multilingual magazine, and the Yale-NUS Society for Academic Research, which publishes academic journals. Campus alt= The Yale-NUS campus is adjacent to NUS University Town and the College moved to this permanent campus in July 2015. It consists of a central campus green flanked by academic and administrative buildings. The campus was designed by architectural firms Pelli Clarke Pelli and Forum Architects (a Singaporean architecture studio), who state that \\"its architectural style blends the collegiate traditions of Yale with the Southeast Asian cultures through its modernist style ornamented by metalwork patterns inspired by southeast Asian textiles.\\" Unlike the neighbouring University Town, Yale-NUS's campus is built on a grid system. The campus was designed to achieve the highest rating under the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark, Singapore's benchmark for sustainable design. In addition to visible sustainable design strategies such as the biofiltration pond and the frequent use of natural ventilation, the campus integrates advanced building systems for energy efficiency. Yale- NUS's campus was awarded the Green Mark Platinum Award from the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) in 2013 (recertified in 2018), the Landscape Excellence Assessment Framework certificate in 2014 (recertified in 2017), the International Architecture Award in 2016., the ASEAN Energy Awards for Energy Efficient Building in 2019 and the Building Performance Awards for Facilities Management (CIBSE) in 2020. Alumni Upon graduation, Yale-NUS alumni will receive alumni membership of National University of Singapore and will be international affiliates in the Association of Yale Alumni (AYA), although not membership to the Yale Club of Singapore. Yale-NUS has its own Alumni Affairs Council and is working to establish a Yale-NUS Club of Singapore. Since graduating its first class in June 2017, Yale-NUS alumni have won several post-graduate awards, including its first Rhodes Scholar and two Schwarzman Scholars. They have also achieved an employment rate of 93.3%, with a median monthly salary of SGD3,500. As of 2019, 439 students from the College‚Äôs first three cohorts have graduated, and are living and working across five continents in cities as diverse as Hong Kong, London, New York, San Francisco, Shanghai, Stockholm and Sydney, in addition to Singapore. Those from the Class of 2019 achieved an employment rate of 95.8%, with a media monthly salary of SGD3,800. Approximately 15% of the College‚Äôs 2019 graduates went on to pursue Master‚Äôs and PhD programmes in the world‚Äôs top institutions, such as Johns Hopkins University, London School of Economics, Stanford University, National University of Singapore (NUS), Tsinghua University, University of Cambridge, University of Oxford and Yale University.  Mascot  Yale-NUS launched the College Mascot in 2017. The Yale-NUS College Mascot - 'Halcyon' - emerged as a representation of the blue-eared kingfisher species found rarely in Singapore. The orange-and-blue mascot, colours of Yale-NUS, found ready acceptance as it also encapsulates the core identity of a young academic institution in quick and confident ascension, ready to take on the world. The mascot was ratified by the student body on April 7, 2016 after three rounds of voting. Since ratification, the Yale-NUS Student Government held focus group discussions to gather feedback on the mascot design and name. The name Halcyon emerged from one of these student focus group discussions. Reactions Observers in the New York Times and the Chronicle of Higher Education see Yale's move as part of a larger movement of the globalization of higher education. Yale faced criticism for its involvement in Singapore because of the government's restrictions on freedom of assembly and ban on homosexual activity. Fareed Zakaria, a CNN host and fellow of the Yale Corporation at the time, supported the venture, saying that \\"Singapore has a great deal to learn from America, and NUS has a great deal to learn from Yale.\\" Tommy Koh, former Singaporean Ambassador to the United Nations, called it a \\"timely and visionary initiative\\" Faculty expressed themselves in the pages of Yale Daily News. Seyla Benhabib, a political philosopher at Yale, calling it a \\"na√Øve missionary sentiment,\\" asked, \\"Do we need to go to Singapore to advance interdisciplinarity and a revival of the liberal arts?\\" The chairs of the faculty search committee responded, \\"the new college will require faculty to rethink their pedagogical assumptions and to consider such innovations as integrated and interactive approaches to science; writing across the curriculum; computation, computer simulations and interpretation of large data sets; and the honing of quantitative, communication and other skills.\\" Howard Bloch, a Sterling Professor of French, said that \\"As a nexus between India, China and the West, Singapore‚Äôs location favors an important conceptual realignment of the humanities that will be a long time coming to the home campus in New Haven ‚Äî that is, a synthesis of the ways that ideas and creative works of East and West intersect historically as well as conceptually with each other.\\" A group of professors critical of the project characterize the endeavor of \\"globalizing\\" a \\"specious one,\\" saying that the graduates \\"will have to be conformist, dissent-averse managers and executives who serve the global profit motive.\\" Marvin Chun, the master of Berkeley College and educated in South Korea, disagreed, asking \\"Will Yale-NUS be denied to numerous students around the world like me who lack the hyper-talent or mega- resources needed to study abroad at a place like Yale?\\" In response to concerns that Yale-NUS would dilute the Yale name, computer science professor Michael Fischer argued that since Yale-NUS will not be granting Yale degrees, the value of a degree from Yale will not be diminished, and that the joint governing board does not \\"make Yale-NUS a part of Yale any more than does [Yale President Richard] Levin's service on the board of directors for American Express make American Express a part of Yale.\\" Haun Saussy stated says that \\"It‚Äôs in the spirit of the motto \\"Lux et veritas\\" ‚Äî my light is not diminished when my neighbor lights his candle at mine, and a truth becomes more powerful, not less, when it is shared.\\" In spring 2012, the Yale College faculty passed a resolution stating, \\"We urge Yale-NUS to respect, protect and further principles of non-discrimination for all, including sexual minorities and migrant workers; and to uphold civil liberty and political freedom on campus and in the broader society\\". In the summer, prompted by a Wall Street Journal report that students would not be allowed to stage protests or form political parties, Human Rights Watch stated that it disapproved such restrictions. John Riady, an Associate Professor of Law at the Pelita Harapan University in Indonesia, defended the venture, stating that \\"Singapore and Asia are in the middle of great transitions, and Yale has an opportunity to shape that process and put its stamp on a rising continent. In fact, Yale would be doing the cause of liberty a disservice by dropping the project.\\" Since its founding Yale-NUS has hosted a number of controversial events on its campus, including screening banned documentaries and hosting conversations with activists. In 2015, Yale-NUS became the first higher education institution in Singapore to offer gender neutral housing to students. The move was in response to a push by the inaugural Yale-NUS Student Government. The project, executed by government representatives David Chappell, Jay Lusk, and Ami Firdaus Bin Mohamed Ali, used a mixture of survey data, student testimonies and statements from student organisations to advocate for the policy change. The move was greeted favourably by students interviewed by the press and in the pages of The Octant, one of the college's online student publications. The College received increased media scrutiny in response to student calls for the resignation of Chan Heng Chee, a Yale-NUS Governing Board Member and Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large. Chan defended Section 377A of the Singaporean Penal Code, a law forbidding sodomy, at the United Nations Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review in Geneva in January 2016. In February, The Octant published an op-ed by Nik Carverhill that called on Chan to either take a stand against Section 377A or relinquish her seat on the governing board. The article received coverage in the Singaporean press. In response, Chan attended a closed door dialogue in March, hosted by the Yale- NUS Student Government and The G Spot, a gender and sexuality alliance on campus, to discuss Singapore's approach to human-rights. 87% of students surveyed by The Octant said that they did not think Chan should resign, although 62% of respondents supported the dialogue. Chan remains a member of the Yale-NUS governing board. Reports in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Times Higher Education, Barron‚Äôs Magazine and Harvard Magazine on the new college, which started classes in August 2013, noted that lively discussions take place on campus. Barron's Magazine's article ‚ÄúYale goes to Asia‚Äù highlighted how education experts such as Ben Nelson, CEO of the Minerva Project, particularly likes Yale-NUS‚Äô emphasis on seminars and its requirement that all students in their first two years take pretty much the same core curriculum, including philosophy and political thought, literature and humanities, and modern social thought. In an article for The Atlantic, Michael Roth, President of Wesleyan University and author of Beyond the University: Why Liberal Education Matters write about how he was impressed by Yale-NUS‚Äô decision to decline to institutionalize faculty within departments representing the academic disciplines.

The station site has been reused as part of the Luton to Dunstable Busway. History On 12 June 1861, the Great Northern Railway acquired the Hertford, Luton and Dunstable Railway's line from Dunstable Church Street station to Luton Bute Street station, which had opened to goods traffic on 5 April 1858 and to passengers on 3 May. From Luton Bute Street station, the line headed westwards through Luton passing Kenilworth Road stadium and Laporte's chemical works before reaching a level crossing at Chaul End. A small timber 10-lever signal box was located here on the Up side of the line with a gatekeeper's house standing opposite. The crossing was protected by a home and distant signal in each direction; the distant being an upper quadrant signal while the home was a somersault signal. As part of the First World War war effort, a factory at Chaul End was taken over for the manufacture of shells. A temporary halt to serve the factory was opened in 1914 or 1915 The station is believed to have been situated to the east of the level crossing. Munitions workers using the station could be easily recognised by the orange- yellow dust from the powder with which shells were filled. London and North Western Railway trains also called at the station from 28 February 1916; tickets to the station showed it as \\"Luton (Chaul End)\\". The factory itself was served by a siding capable of accommodating five wagons, which was taken out of use on 20 April 1916. The station closed in either 1919 or 1920, and was demolished soon afterwards.  Present day  The signal box at Chaul End remained in use until 1 November 1969, following which it was boarded up and the gatekeeper's house opposite demolished. The level crossing remained in use until the 1980s when it was replaced by a bridge carrying the road over the line. The line remained open until oil traffic on the line ceased on 30 April 1989 when it was mothballed and then officially closed on 28 March 1991. The Luton to Dunstable Busway passes through the site.

Founded in 1999, it is located in the Brussels municipality of Ixelles (Elsene). The school combines nursery, primary and secondary education, with 3,097 students enrolled at the start of the 2018-2019 academic year, spread over seven language sections (English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Greek and Czech). The school priotises the children of European Union (EU) staff for enrolment purposes, with others able to enrol provided there is capacity. Transport links to the school campus include Delta station, which provides metro and suburban rail services.  History  The first European School in Brussels was founded in 1958 with the primary purpose of providing an education to the children of officials of the Brussels-based institutions of the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community, which had been established that same year. Subsequent enlargement of the European Communities - and later European Union -, the consolidation of European institutions in Brussels, and increasing staff numbers to correspond to deepening levels of European integration all increased demand for places within the European School system in Brussels. This resulted in the addition of a second school in Brussels in 1974, before the European School, Brussels III was founded in 1999. Following the so-called \\"Big Bang\\" EU enlargement of 2004 and the consequent arrival of additional EU staff, a surplus of students attempting to enrol in the school led to the opening of the European School, Brussels IV in the Brussels suburb of Laeken.

The name 3-6-3 refers to the impression that bankers had a stable, comfortable existence by paying 3 percent interest on deposits, lending money out at 6 percent, and being able to \\"tee off at the golf course by 3 p.m.\\" The implication was that the banks were less competitive during that period than in subsequent years due to tight regulations that limited the formation and location of banks as well as restrictions on interest rates that could be charged or paid. As a result, bankers had \\"power and prestige ... while profits were steady and certain\\". These regulations were loosened in the 1980s. Richmond Federal Reserve senior economist John R. Walter argues that, although there is evidence that restrictions on banks before the 1980s did limit the competitiveness of banking markets and thereby granted some banks monopoly power, \\"the regulatory restrictions probably had a limited effect on competition\\" during the time in question. Chicago Federal Reserve researchers Robert DeYoung and Tara Rice argue that, \\"Like most good jokes, the 3-6-3 rule mixes a grain of truth with a highly simplified view of reality.\\" The rule has been noted positively following the late-2000s financial crisis as a preferable way for banks to operate following the bailout of major banks.

Plot Determined to better herself, Maisie Ravier graduates from the Benson Business School in Los Angeles, but has to fend off the advances of Mr. Benson. She encounters the same problem at her first few job interviews: what the male bosses are interested in is not her secretarial skills. So she dresses as dowdily as she can and gets hired by Joseph \\"Joe\\" Morton. He has invented a helicopter that is easy to fly, and received financial backing from J. G. Nuboult. When he learns of her deception, Joe suspects Maisie is an industrial spy, but she convinces him she was merely trying to avoid amorous bosses. He assures her she will have no such difficulty with him. He is thrilled to learn that during World War II, she had a job helping assemble the very bombers he himself flew, and introduces her to his men: wartime crewmates Mitch O'Hara and Bill Stuart, and college friend Tim Kingby. Then he sets her to work not only in the office, but also at welding and other assembly tasks. Eventually, Maisie and Joe fall in love. Meanwhile, Joe persuades Seattle tycoon Floyd Hendrickson to come to a demonstration flight at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. He will personally fly Hendrickson by aircraft to Los Angeles for this. What Joe does not know is that Nuboult is scheming to steal his invention, assisted by Tim. After Maisie, now Joe's fianc√©e, notices that they are being billed for twice the correct number of some parts and decides to check their records for other occurrences, Nuboult's daughter Barbara distracts her by inviting her to a Sunday social at an exclusive club, where she spikes Maisie's drink. Maisie ends up diving into the pool with her clothes on, and Barbara makes sure this is reported as news. Feeling she would disgrace Joe, Maisie goes into hiding, but in fact Joe is distraught at her leaving. He and his men search desperately, contacting police and hiring a private detective. While Joe is flying Hendrickson to the demonstration, the plotters set their plan into motion. They steal the prototype and substitute a partial copy, made with the duplicate parts Tim arranged for; then they burn down Joe's workshop with their copy inside. Maisie happens to hear about the fire and rushes there. She becomes suspicious when Nuboult shows up with Joe's canceled contract immediately after the fire is put out. When she cannot find in the wreckage the badges she welded to the helicopter for good luck, she guesses the truth. Maisie, Mitch, and Bill find the real helicopter by following Tim. A fight breaks out when they try to get it back. Maisie is told to take the helicopter up. Having typed the manuals, she has learned enough to do it, and begins flying across Los Angeles. Worried by the tall buildings, she hovers just outside one and asks if there is a phone she can use. A startled cleaning woman passes one out to her, using the rope of a horizontal flagpole. She phones Joe at the Rose Bowl to ask for help. He begs her to land as soon as she can.

They were removed from curbs and sidewalks for safety purposes until the late 1970s, when one Portland resident complained about the rings disappearing. Today, the city of Portland helps to preserve the rings by requiring them to be replaced following sidewalk construction or repair. In recent years Portland residents have started tethering model horses to the rings, sparking interaction, and drawing attention to part of the city's history. The Horse Project, started by one resident of the Woodstock neighborhood in 2005, encourages participation in the urban art movement. The rings and art installations have become a tourist attraction. Background and history Horse ring near Southeast 37th and Belmont Street in 2012 Horse rings, often made of iron or brass, are remnants from the 1800s, when horses, and horse-drawn vehicles, provided the primary mode of transportation. In 1978, The Register-Guard suggested that the rings might only be as old as the early 1900s. The rings allowed residents to tether their horses to sidewalks. Prior to the late 1970s, rings were removed during sidewalk reconstruction or repair for safety purposes. In 1978, after one Portland resident complained about the disappearance of rings, Connie McCready, then a City Commissioner, announced that rings could be replaced at a homeowner's request, likely for a fee of $5. Today, the city of Portland is committed to preserving the horse rings, which are reinstalled following curb and sidewalk construction or repair. An ordinance requires rings to be replaced at their original location (or \\"as close as practical\\"). Original street names are also reset or restamped into new concrete. The ring supply is monitored by the Bureau of Maintenance. Portland is not the only city to preserve horse rings. City officials in Oak Harbor, Washington, confirmed that the last in a series of horse rings would be preserved during a February 2011 sidewalk construction project. Note: This article was originally published in the Whidbey News-Times (Oak Harbor, Washington) on December 1, 2010. Horse Project Tethered toy horse in 2009 In September 2005, Woodstock resident Scott Wayne Indiana tied his first plastic toy horse to a horse ring located in the Pearl District. Of his attempt to draw attention to the rings, and to celebrate Portland's history, Indiana said: \\"I loved the rings, and felt that people just weren't noticing them. This was an attempt to shake people out of their routines and get them to notice their surroundings.\\" Since then, the Horse Project has gained momentum and participation; horses can be found tied to rings throughout the city, especially in east Portland. The installations have sparked interaction with residents, who have left hay, lassoes, riders, saddles, water, wool blankets, and other \\"treats\\" for the horses. Horses are often defaced or go missing. Tethered toy tiger in 2007 The Horse Project has an official website, which encourages participation, and offers instructions for tethering. The project accepts donations and volunteer support. Participants considered selling kits for consumers interested in tethering horses. One Portland resident has reportedly installed more than 150 horses. Horses are the most frequent animal to be tied to rings, but pigs, dolls, and other animals have also appeared throughout the city. Willamette Week included the Horse Project in its Best of Portland list for 2006 under the category Best Horse of a Different Color. In 2007, The Oregonian Anna Griffin mentioned the project in an article about the \\"Keep Portland Weird\\" slogan, writing: \\"The 'Horse Project' comes up anytime the subject of Portland weirdness arises.\\" Project participation continues despite Indiana's move out of state in 2008. In 2011, the documentary film It's a Ring Thing: The Portland Horse Project premiered at NW Documentary's Homegrown DocFest. In 2012, The Oregonian highlighted the engagement of a couple who attribute the start of their relationship to a horse ring installation in the Pearl District. The city's \\"Sustainable Stormwater Management\\" calendar for 2012 called the installations \\"stormwater art\\", which \\"highlights healthy watersheds and demonstrates that stormwater is a resource and an asset\\".

In 2011, McDowell, who was also a producer on the film, said the film was currently being made and would be titled Monster Butler. The film was set to begin shooting in June 2012 in Scotland. According to Dominic Monaghan on Twitter, the film was cancelled due to lack of funds but may go ahead in the future. In June 2015 McDowell cancelled an appearance at the Edinburgh Film Festival intended to promote his new film Bereave, after a campaign by media union BECTU which alleged that crew members on Monster Butler had not been paid despite assurances by McDowell, who was a producer on the troubled film.

It starred Ally Sheedy, Stephen Caffrey and Tracey Needham. It was directed by Tim Matheson, who also reprised his character from the previous film, Clint Goodman. It first aired on June 18, 1997 on the USA Network.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118800/releaseinfo Background The film stars Ally Sheedy as Laura Riskin, Stephen Caffrey as Randy Riskin and Tracey Needham as Roxanne. Others in the film include Tim Matheson reprising his role as Clint Goodman, Brian Libby reprising his role as Earl the Embalmer, Clifton Daniel as Walter and Tommy Hinkley as Sheriff Jim Puller. The film was produced by Niki Marvin who also produced the original film. Buried Alive II has a similar plot to Buried Alive, with the gender of the main characters reversed. Plot 10 years have passed since the events of the first movie. Clint Goodman has been living a solitary life elsewhere under the assumed name Michael Haden, while everyone in the original town believes he was dead. Despite the survival of his murder, he now suffers from serious health issues due to the effects of the toxin and his near-death experience. When his old friend Sheriff Sam Eberly passes away, Clint decides to come back and attend the funeral. Sam's niece Laura Riskin, who knew Clint a long time ago, notices him, but he quickly leaves before she can approach him. Laura then finds out that she‚Äôs inherited some stock worth $250,000, which her uncle Sam bought and left to her. She wants to start a family with the money, but her husband Randy, who hates his life in the small town, wants to buy a yacht instead and leave there for good. Laura doesn't sympathize with him. Unknown to Laura, Randy is having an affair with the local vixen Roxanne. He promises Roxanne to dump Laura as soon as he finds a way to leave with her, but she can't wait. Randy knows what happened to Clint and decides to do the same thing to Laura. Meanwhile, Laura corners Clint, who tells her to forget him because he is just like a wanted man. Laura decides to forgive Randy, believing he has changed. When they go out for dinner that evening, he slips the toxin into her wine. Laura soon gets into a cardiac arrest and seemingly dies after consuming the spiked wine, realizing as she collapses that Randy has poisoned her. When the doctor asks Randy if he wants an autopsy, he declines. The case doesn't raise the police's suspicion because Laura's family has a history of heart failure. Clint has a heart attack after reading about Laura's death in the newspaper. At the hospital, he asks how Laura died, but the doctor only tells him that her funeral is being prepared. He wants to go there, but the doctor doesn't let him leave. At the morgue, as Laura is about to be embalmed, the machine malfunctions. As a result, the staff doesn't embalm her, although Randy had requested her body to be embalmed twice. After Laura's funeral, Clint approaches Randy and warns him that Laura may not be dead, with Randy questioning who Clint is. That night, after having a nightmare about his escape from the grave, Clint digs Laura up and believes that she is dead. His exertions on top of his already weakened condition cause a fatal heart attack and he finally dies. Laura wakes up and escapes her grave. She puts Clint's body in her coffin and buries it. She goes home to find Randy and Roxanne in bed together. Devastated, she intends to kill them with a spear gun. However, when she hears that Randy wants to have children with Roxanne, something he refused to do with her, she changes her mind, plotting better revenge. Over the next few days, Randy notices strange things in his home, including finding Laura's wedding ring, which had supposedly been buried with her. He has his wife's grave exhumed to make sure she is dead but finds Clint's body instead. Upon discovering that the dead person is Clint, Clint's grave is exhumed, and they find the remains of Joanna and Cortland, along with the money they got from selling Clint's business. Suspecting that Laura is still alive, Randy hastily buys a yacht, and he and Roxanne prepare to leave town. As they are packing their luggage, Laura traps them both inside a tool shed by blocking the door with Randy's truck. She attaches a hose to the exhaust pipe and feeds it through the vent. The fumes knock them unconscious. Randy and Roxanne wake up on board the yacht with all doors locked and sealed shut with screws. Roxanne sees Laura peering down through a skylight just before she blocks it off. Randy tries to save himself by blaming Roxanne, causing Roxanne to fire a flare gun at him. When the yacht tilts, Randy realizes that Laura intends to sink it and bury them alive at the sea. With the water pouring in through the open bilges, he tries to shut off the bilge valve, but she has broken it off. Reaching a storage room, they find a set of funeral clothes and a lifebuoy that says \\"R.I.P. Randy and Roxanne\\" painted on it. Laura asks Randy why he tried to kill her, then blocks off the last vent and leaves in a motorized dinghy, pausing to look back and watch as the yacht disappears beneath the surface. The next day, Laura visits Clint's grave, thanking him for what he's done. She then leaves the town with Clint's dog Duke to start a new life. The camera pans down through the water down to the seabed, where Randy and Roxanne hopelessly scream for help inside the sunken yacht.

(uncredited) Reception Allmovie.com gave the film two out of five stars and summed the film up by stating \\"Entertaining in its own 'they liked it once, they'll love it twice' fashion.\\" The Video Graveyard gave the film two out of five stars and wrote \\"Ho-hum sequel basically steps into the same plot mold as the original only with the sexes reversed as Ally Sheedy finds herself the victim of a murder plot by husband Stephen Caffrey and his lover Tracey Needham only for her death to be mistaken after which she returns from her grave and extracts revenge. While familiarity with the original is a plus this is only a mild thriller that panders to its television limitations and suffers from having too much in common with the first one. Not nearly as gripping with Matheson's involvement weak and revenge that's too little, too late. Pretty tedious with Caffery and Needham eventually slipping into bad acting territory during the finale. Brian Libby reprises his comic relief role as the town's embalmer.\\" Both the Video Movie Guide 2002 (Ballantine Books) and The Video Source Book (Performing Arts) gave the film a rating of 2.5 stars out of five.

The club is a member of the Antrim GAA and currently fields teams in Hurling, Gaelic football, Camogie and Handball. The club is named after Irish patriot and revolutionary Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa and one of the club founders was Joe McKelvey. History O'Donovan Rossa GAC was founded in 1916 at Bunkers Hill, now the site of Kennedy‚Äôs old bakery in Beechmount Avenue on the Falls Road. At foundation, the membership was confined to Irish Volunteers and amongst the first members were Sean Osbourne, Joe McKelvey, Sean Hackett from Tipperary, with Sean O‚ÄôSullivan as the first chairman. Soon the young club was making its presence felt, winning the Hurling Championship in 1918, 1919 and 1921, while the footballers collected the Football Championship in 1920 and 1921, completing the double in 1921. For a number of subsequent years County Championships eluded the club, but in 1938 they had a narrow victory over Dunloy at Corrigan Park by 2 points to 1 point. At the start of the 1940s Rossa welcomed most of the St Mary‚Äôs C.B.S. team as members of the club. These players made their contribution to renewed success, winning many Senior Football and Hurling Championships in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1988, the club won an All Ireland Semi Final against Patrickswell GAA. In an epic game played in Limerick, Rossa emerged as one point winners against a Patrickswell side that included greats like Gary Kirby and Ciar√°n Carey. The team eventually lost in the All Ireland Final at Croke Park to a Buffers Alley side led by Tony Doran.

The square is home to three important public monuments created by leading mid-20th century sculptors. Description In 1986 (two years before the war's end) the Iraqi Ba'athist government began construction of a festival and parade ground in Zawra Park, near the extensive presidential complex in the center of Baghdad. The square is located near the Harthiya and in the fortified Green Zone, and the site was specifically selected for its symbolic value. Iraqis generally believe it is the same location where the Muslim Arabs defeated the Persians in 636 CE and this historic event is seen to be the beginning of Islamic domination of the region.Al-Khalilm, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, pp. 10‚Äì12 The site was intended to become the place where military parades and national events would be held. Known as Grand Festivities Square, it comprised a large parade ground, an extensive review pavilion and a large reflecting pool. The surrounding grassy areas hosted Iraqis during military parades. Adding to the festive appeal of the grounds were three refreshments booths that sold ice cream, cold beverages, and candy. The then leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein commissioned three major public artworks for the area. These artworks were to be memorials to Iraq's fallen soldiers, a remembrance of Iraq's pain and suffering as a consequence of the Iran-Iraq war and symbols of Iraq's victory in the war. The Monument to the Unknown Soldier, based on a concept by Iraqi sculptor, Khaled al-Rahal, and situated just beyond the perimeter of the square, had already opened in 1982.Bloom, J. and Blair, S. S., Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art & Architecture, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251 Another major work, the colossal, Al-Shaheed Monument designed by Iraqi sculptor, Ismail Fatah Al Turk, and situated on the river bank had been inaugurated in 1983. Hussein commissioned a third monument, the Victory Arches, another concept by the sculptor, Khaled Al-Rahal, to be built in the same vicinity and it was inaugurated in 1989. The Victory Arches mark the entrances to the square. On the day the arches were dedicated (8 August, 1989), Saddam rode under the arches astride a white horse. Marozzi, J., Baghdad: City of Peace, City of Blood, Penguin UK, 2014, [E-book edition], n.p. It is generally acknowledged that Hussein intended to cast an allusion to the slain Shiite martyr Hussein, killed in Karbala in 680 CE, whose death caused the rift between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. The monument, although presenting a triumphalist narrative in relation to the Iran-Iraq war, has assumed a broader symbolism and represents those Iraqis who fell in any war throughout the country's history.Al-Khalilm, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, pp. 10‚Äì12 The three monuments in the vicinity of the square form a visual and symbolic unit.Makiya, K. and Al- Khalilm, S., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, p. 29 The construction of the three artworks was part of a broader Ba'athist government program to beautify Baghdad, instil a sense of national pride, and at the same time immortalise Sadam Hussein's reputation as a powerful leader.Brown, B. A. and Feldman, M. H. (eds), Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art, Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p. xix Recent developments The Square has become a place for public demonstrations and protests.

The movement's political wing was officially founded in February 1973 from a previous organization bearing the same name and its military wing was formed in January 1975. The Amal militia was a major player in the Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1991. The militia has now been disarmed, though the movement itself, now known as the Amal Movement (Arabic: Harakat Amal), is a notable Shia political party in Lebanon. Creation The Amal militia was founded in 1975 as the militant wing of the Movement of the Disinherited, a Shi'a political movement founded by Musa al- Sadrhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7584557.stm and Hussein el-Husseini a year earlier. It became one of the most important Shi'a Muslim militias during the Lebanese Civil War. Amal grew strong with the support of, and through its ties with, SyriaByman, Deadly Connections: States that Sponsor Terrorism (2005), page unknown. and the 300,000 Shi'a internal refugees from southern Lebanon after the Israeli bombings in the early 1980s. Amal's practical objectives were to gain greater respect for Lebanon's Shi'ite population and the allocation of a larger share of governmental resources for the Shi'ite-dominated southern part of the country. At its zenith, the militia had 14,000 troops. Amal fought a long campaign against Palestinian refugees during the Lebanese Civil War (called the War of the Camps). After the War of the Camps, Amal fought a bloody battle against rival Shi'a group Hezbollah for control of Beirut, which provoked Syrian military intervention. Hezbollah itself was formed by religious members of Amal who had left after Nabih Berri's assumption of full control and the subsequent resignation of most of Amal's earliest senior members. History=Timeline Harakat al-Mahrumin (ÿ≠ÿ±ŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿ±ŸàŸÖŸäŸÜ  The Movement of the Dispossessed) was established by Imam Musa al-Sadr and member of parliament Hussein el-Husseini in 1974. On January 20, 1975 the Lebanese Resistance Detachments (also referred to in English as 'Battalions of the Lebanese Resistance') is formed as the military wing of the Movement of the Disinherited under the leadership of al-Sadr. In 1978 the founder al-Sadr disappears in mysterious circumstances while visiting Libya and was succeeded by Hussein el-Husseini as leader of Amal. In 1979 Palestinian guerrillas attempt to assassinate then-Secretary General Hussein el-Husseini by launching missiles into his home, outside Beirut. In 1980 Hussein el-Husseini resigned from Amal leadership after refusing to \\"drench Amal in blood\\" and fight alongside the PLO or any other faction. In 1980 Nabih Berri became one of the leaders of Amal, marking the entry of Amal in the Lebanese Civil War. In summer 1982 Husayn Al-Musawi, deputy head and official spokesman of Amal, broke away to form the Islamist Islamic Amal Movement. In May 1985, heavy fighting erupted between Amal and Palestinian camp militias for the control of the Sabra, Shatila and Burj el-Barajneh camps in Beirut, sparking the so-called \\"War of the Camps\\" which lasted until 1987. In December 1985 Nabih Berri of Amal, Walid Jumblatt of the Druze Progressive Socialist Party, and Elie Hobeika of the Lebanese Forces signed the Tripartite Accord in Damascus which was supposed to give strong influence to Damascus regarding Lebanese matters. The agreement never came into effect due to Hobeika's ousting. Heavy fighting erupted between Hezbollah and Amal in the wake of the \\"War of Camps\\" to which Hezbollah was opposed to. Syrian forces entered the area to help Amal against Hezbollah, Syrian troops killed dozens of Hezbollah members in which they claimed the members attacked them while Hezbollah claimed they were killed in cold blood. Fighting between the two factions lasted until 1989.Hezbollah: Between Tehran and Damascus On February 22, 1987, Amal and the Druze PLA again turned against each other in what became known as the \\"War of the Flag\\". The conflict was sparked by an incident early that day, when a PLA fighter walked to the Channel 7 TV station (French: T√©l√© Liban ‚Äì Canal 7) building in the Tallet el-Khayyat quarterHokayem, L'arm√©e libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du pr√©sident de la R√©publique (1975‚Äì1985) (2012), p. 27. and replaced the Lebanese national flag hoisted there by the PSP flag, which was interpreted by Amal militiamen as a deliberate act of provocation. A new round of brutal fighting soon spread throughout western Beirut, and although Amal forces initially managed to restore the Lebanese national flag on the Channel 7 building, they were subsequently overpowered by an alliance of PLA, LCP/Popular Guard and SSNP militias, who quickly seized large portions of West Beirut. Eventually, the fighting was curbed by the massive deployment at West Beirut of Syrian troops under the command of Major-General Ghazi Kanaan, assisted by Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) gendarmes. On February 17, 1988 the American Chief of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) observer mission in Lebanon, Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, was abducted and later killed after meeting with Amal's political leader of southern Lebanon. Amal responded by launching a campaign against Hezbollah in the south, It was believed that Hezbollah abducted him; Though the party to this day denies it and insists that it was done to create problems between them and the Amal movement.Ranstorp, Hizb'allah in Lebanon (1997), p. 101. In April 1988 Amal launched an all-out assault on Hezbollah positions in south Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut. Early in May 1988 Hezbollah gained control of 80% of the Shi'ite suburbs of Beirut through well-timed assaults. In 1989 Amal accepted the Taif agreement (mainly authored by el-Husseini) in order to end the civil war. In September 1991, with background in the Syrian controlled end of the Lebanese Civil War in October 1990, 2,800 Amal troops joined the Lebanese army. Origin The origins of the Amal movement lie with the Lebanese cleric of Iranian origin Imam Musa al-Sadr. In 1974, the Harakat al- Mahrumin (Movement of the Deprived)Nasr, The Shia Revival (2006), p. 85. was established by al-Sadr and member of parliament Hussein el-Husseini to attempt to reform the Lebanese system. While acknowledging its support base to be the \\"traditionally under-represented politically and economically disadvantaged\\" Shi'a community,Byman, Deadly Connections: States that Sponsor Terrorism (2005), p. 82. it aimed, according to Palmer-Harik, to seek social justice for all deprived Lebanese.Palmer-Harik, Hezbollah: The Changing Face of Terrorism (2004), page unknown. Although influenced by Islamic ideas, it was a secular movement trying to unite people along communal rather than religious or ideological lines. The Greek-Catholic Archbishop of Beirut, Mgr. Gr√©goire Haddad, was among the founders of the Movement.Augustus Richard Norton, Hezbollah: A Short History Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007.Hizbullah, a progressive Islamic party? - Interview with Joseph Alagha On January 20, 1975, the Lebanese Resistance Detachments (also referred to in English as 'The Battalions of the Lebanese Resistance') were formed as a military wing of The Movement of the Disinherited under the leadership of al- Sadr, and came to be popularly known as Amal (from the acronym Afwaj al- Mouqawma Al-Lubnaniyya). In 1978, al-Sadr disappeared in mysterious circumstances while visiting Libya, the Amal movement's regional supporter at the time. There are credible allegations that Yasser Arafat asked Gaddafi to \\"disappear\\" al-Sadr. Hussein el-Husseini became leader of Amal and was followed by Nabih Berri in April 1980 after el-Husseini resigned. One of the consequences of the rise of Berri, a less educated leader, the increasing secular yet sectarian nature of the movement and move away from an Islamic context for the movement was a splintering of the movement. Military structure and organization The movement's militia was secretly established on 20 January 1975 with the help of the Palestinian Fatah, who provided weapons and training at their Beqaa facilities. The formation of Amal was revealed in July that year when an accidental explosion of a landmine at one of the Fatahland camps near Baalbek killed over 60 Shia trainees, which caused considerable embarrassment to Fatah and forced Al-Sadr to admit publicly the militia's existence.Weinberger, Syrian Intervention in Lebanon: The 1975-76 Civil War (1986), p. 157.Ammoun, Histoire du Liban contemporain: Tome 2 1943-1990 (2005), page unknown. When the civil war finally broke out in April 1975, Amal's strength stood at about 1,500‚Äì3,000 armed militants, backed by a motor force of gun-trucks (a.k.a. technicals) fitted with heavy machine guns, recoilless rifles and anti-aircraft autocannons. By the mid-1980s however, the movement totaled 14,000‚Äì16,000 militiamen trained and armed by Syria, of which 3,000‚Äì6,000 were full-time uniformed regularsMakdisi and Sadaka, The Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990 (2003), p. 44, Table 1: War Period Militias. and the remaining 10,000 part-time male and female irregulars. Amal's regular forces were bolstered by 6,000 ex-Lebanese Army soldiers from the Sixth Brigade, a predominantly Shia Muslim formation that went over to their co-religionists following the collapse of the government forces in February 1984.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 137.Nerguizian, Cordesman & Burke, The Lebanese Armed Forces: Challenges and Opportunities in Post-Syria Lebanon (2009), pp. 56-57.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 155.

Administrative organization and illegal activities Amal's main sphere of influence encompassed the Shia-populated slum districts located at south- western Beirut of Chyah, Bir Abed, Bir Hassan, Ouza'i and Khalde, with the latter including the adjoining International Airport, which they brought under their control in late February 1984.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 139. Outside the Lebanese Capital, they also operated at Baalbek and Hermel in the Beqaa, and in the southern Jabal Amel region, notably around the port cities of Tyre and Sidon, and in the Iqlim al-Tuffah region down to the UNIFIL zone.Bicard, Prospects for Lebanon ‚Äì The Demobilization of the Lebanese Militias, p. 14. In addition to Syrian backing, Amal received some financial support from Libya and Iran ‚Äì first by the Shah in 1975-78, replaced after 1979 by the new Islamic regime ‚Äì and from the Lebanese Shi'ite immigrant community in West Africa. Additional revenues came from protection rackets (Arabic: Khuwa) imposed on Shia neighborhoods and from tolls levied in illegal ports such as Ouza'i in Beirut, along with Zahrani, whose harbour and the adjacent Tapline oil refinery were employed in the contraband of fuel, and Sarafand (used for smuggling imported cars and other goods), both located south of Sidon. The Movement had its own civil administration and assistance networks, gathered since the mid-1980s under the authority of the so-called 'Council of the South' (Arabic: ŸÖÿ¨ŸÑÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜŸàÿ®  Majliss al-Janoub). Headed by Amal's vice-president Muhammad Baydoun and based at the Christian town of Maghdouch√© near Sidon, it was responsible for running schools, hospitals, and conducting public works on Shia areas. Amal also run from its headquarters at Rue Hamra ‚Äì located on the namesake district ‚Äì, in association with Zahir Al- Khatib's Toilers League a joint television service, \\"The Orient\\" (Arabic: Al- Machriq). Split with \\"Islamic Amal\\" In the summer of 1982, Husayn Al- Musawi, deputy head and official spokesman of Amal, broke with Berri over his willingness to go along with U.S. mediation in Lebanon rather than attack Israeli troops, his membership in the National Salvation Council alongside the Christians,Wright, Sacred Rage (2001) pp. 61-62. and his opposition to pledging allegiance to Ayatollah Khomeini.Ranstorp, Hizb'allah in Lebanon (1997), p. 31. Musawi formed the Islamist Islamic Amal Movement, based in Baalbeck. It was aided by the Islamic Republic of Iran which, in the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, strove not only to help Lebanon's Shi'a, but to export the PanIslamic revolution to the rest of the Muslim world, something Musawi strongly supported, saying, \\"We are her (the Islamic Republic's) children.\\" > We are seeking to formulate an Islamic society which in the final analysis > will produce an Islamic state. ... The Islamic revolution will march to > liberate Palestine and Jerusalem, and the Islamic state will then spread its > authority over the region of which Lebanon is only a part.Musawi in Monday > Morning magazine, October 31, 1983 shortly before the embassy bombings, > quoted in Wright, Sacred Rage (2001), p. 83. About 1,500 members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard or Pasdaran, arrived at the Beqaa Valley at the time and \\"directly contributed to ensure the survival and growth of al-Musawi's newly-created small militia,\\" providing training, indoctrination and funding.Ranstorp, Hizb'allah in Lebanon (1997) p. 33. Iran was in many ways a natural ally of Shia in Lebanon as it was far larger than Lebanon, oil-rich, and both Shi'a-majority and Shi'a-ruled. And of course, founder Musa al-Sadr had come from Iran. Iran's generous funding meant generous pay for the militias recruits‚Äî$150‚Äì200 per month plus cost-free education and medical treatment for themselves and their families‚Äîthat \\"far exceeded what other [Lebanese] militias were able to offer.\\" This was a major incentive among the impoverished Shi'a community, and induced \\"a sizable number of Amal fighters [to] defected regularly to the ranks\\" of Islamic Amal, and later Hizb'Allah.Ranstorp, Hizb'allah in Lebanon (1997) p. 36. By August 1983, Islamic Amal and Hezbollah were \\"effectively becoming one under the Hezbollah label,\\"Wright, Sacred Rage (2001), p. 84. and by late 1984, Islamic Amal, along with \\"all the known major groups\\" in Lebanon, had been absorbed into Hezbollah.Wright, Sacred Rage (2001), p. 95. The Amal militia in the Lebanese civil war In March‚ÄìApril 1985, Amal militia forces joined in a Syrian-backed coalition with the Popular Nasserist Organization (PNO), the Al- Mourabitoun and the Druze Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) militias, which defeated the Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) attempts to establish bridgeheads at Damour and Sidon.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 156. The War of the Camps The War of the Camps was a series of battles in the mid-1980s between Amal and Palestinian groups. The Druze-oriented Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) and Hezbollah supported the Palestinians while Syria backed Amal. =First battle: May 1985= Although most of the Palestinian guerrillas were expelled during the 1982 Israeli invasion, Palestinian militias began to regain their footing after the Israeli withdrawal firstly from Beirut, then Sidon and Tyre. Syria viewed this revival with some anxiety: though in the same ideological camp, Damascus had little control over most Palestinians organizations and was afraid that the build-up of Palestinian forces could lead to a new Israeli invasion. Moreover, Syria's minority Alawite regime was never comfortable with the Sunni militias in Lebanon, traditionally aligned with Egypt and Iraq. In Lebanon, Shia-Palestinian relations had been very tense since the late 1960s. After the multinational force withdrew from Beirut in February 1984, Amal and the PSP took control of west Beirut and Amal built a number of outposts around the camps (in Beirut but also in the south). On April 15, 1985, Amal and the PSP attacked the Al- Mourabitoun, the main Lebanese Sunni militia and the closest ally of the PLO in Lebanon. The Al-Mourabitoun forces were vanquished after a week of heavy fighting and their leader, Ibrahim Kulaylat was sent into exile.William E. Smith, \\"Lebanon: A Country's Slow Death\\", Time, April 29, 1985, p. 46. On May 19, 1985, heavy fighting erupted between Amal and the Palestinians for the control of the Sabra, Shatila and Burj el-Barajneh camps (all in Beirut). Despite its efforts, Amal could not take the control of the camps. The death toll remains unknown, with estimates ranging from a few hundreds to a few thousands. This and heavy political pressure from the Arab League led to a cease-fire on June 17. =Second battle: May 1986= The situation remained tense and fights occurred again in September 1985 and March 1986. On May 19, 1986, heavy fighting erupted again. Despite new armaments provided by Syria, Amal could not take control of the camps. Many cease-fires were announced, but most of them did not last more than a few days. The situation began to cool after Syria deployed some troops on June 24, 1986. =Third battle September 1986= There was tension in the south, an area where Shi'as and Palestinians were both present. This unavoidably led to frequent clashes. On September 29, 1986, fighting erupted at the Rashidiyye refugee camp near Tyre. The conflict immediately spread to Sidon and Beirut. Palestinian forces managed to occupy the Amal-controlled town of Maghdouch√© on the eastern hills of Sidon to open the road to Rashidiyye. Syrian forces helped Amal and Israel launched air strikes against PLO position around Maghdouche. A cease-fire was negotiated between Amal and pro-Syrian Palestinian groups on December 15, 1986, but it was rejected by Yasser Arafat's Fatah. Fatah tried to appease the situation by giving some of its positions to Hezbollah and to the Al-Mourabitoun. The situation became relatively calm for a while, but the bombing against the camps continued. In Beirut, a blockade of the camps led to a dramatic shortage of food and medications inside the camps. In early 1987, the fighting spread to Hezbollah and the PSP who supported the Palestinians. The PSP, having won numerous battles, quickly seized large portions of west Beirut. Consequently, Syria occupied west Beirut beginning February 21, 1987. On April 7, 1987, Amal finally lifted the siege and handed its positions around the camps to the Syrian army. According to the New York Times (March 10, 1992, citing figures from the Lebanese police), 3,781 were killed in the fighting. =February 1988= AMAL militiaman firing his AK-47 assault rifle during skirmishes with Druze PLA irregulars on the Corniche-al-Mazraa road in West Beirut, 10 February 1987. On February 17, 1988, Lt. Col William R. Higgins, American Chief of the UNTSO observer group in Lebanon, was abducted from his UN vehicle between Tyre and Nakara after a meeting with Abd al-Majid Salah, Amal's political leader in southern Lebanon. It soon became \\"clear that Sheikh al- Musawi, the commander to Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance, had been personally responsible for the abduction of Lt. Col Higgins in close cooperation with both Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid, the local commander of Hizballah's military wing, and Mustafa al-Dirani, the former head of Amal's security service.\\" This is seen as a direct challenge to Amal by Hezbollah, and Amal responds by launching an offensive against Hezbollah in the south where it \\"scores decisive military victories ... leading to the expulsion of a number of Hizballah clergy to the Beqqa\\". In Beirut's southern suburbs however, where fighting also raged, Hizballah was much more successful. \\"[E]lements within Hizballah and the Iranian Pasdaran established a joint command to assassinate high-ranking Amal officials and carry out operations against Amal checkpoints and centers.\\"Voice of Lebanon, 0615 gmt 18 April 88-BBC/SWB/ME/0131, 21 April 1988; and Ha'aretz, 18 April 1988, quoted in Ranstorp, Hizb'allah in Lebanon (1997), p. 101. By May, Amal had suffered major losses, its members were defecting to Hezbollah, and by June, Syria had to intervene militarily to rescue Amal from defeat. In January 1989, a truce in the \\"ferocious\\" fighting between Hizballah and Amal was arranged by Syrian and Iranian intervention. \\"Under this agreement, Amal's authority over the security of southern Lebanon [is] recognized while Hizballah [is] permitted to maintain only a nonmilitary presence through political, cultural, and informational programmes.\\"Ranstorp, Hizb'allah in Lebanon (1997), p. 102. Disbandement Upon the end of the war in October 1990, Amal militia forces operating in the Capital and the Beqaa were ordered by the Lebanese Government on March 28, 1991, to disband and surrender their heavy weaponry by April 30 as stipulated by the Taif Agreement,Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 173. a decision that came a few months after the Movement's leadership had already announced the dissolution of its own military force.Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Lebanon: Current information on the AMAL militia, 1 May 1991, LBN8687. available at: https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ab8464.html [accessed 25 July 2020] The Sixth Brigade was re-integrated into the structure of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) whilst an additional 2,800 ex-Amal militiamen joined the re- formed Lebanese Army in September of the following year. Despite the order to disarm, Amal guerrilla units in the south remained in place until the final Israeli pull-out in May 2000 and the subsequent collapse of the \\"Security Belt\\". One of their last significant operations was the Ansariya Ambush on September 15, 1997, where Amal commandos under Hezbollah command successfully ambushed an Israeli Shayetet 13 naval commando force.

Early life  Schulten-Baumer was born in Kettwig, Essen, Germany. The son of a farmer, he became interested in horses early in life. He helped groom horses at a riding academy across from his school, later he learned to ride there. During his military service he was in the navy, and on Saturdays he would ride the commander's horses. After World War II, he rode the horse Senta at the international show jumping competition CHIO Aachen in 1952. Later he acquired the gelding Gl√ºckspiel from noted dressage trainer Fritz Tempelmann. Riding Gl√ºckspiel, Schulten-Baumer focused solely on dressage and began to train other riders.  Career  Schulten- Baumer worked as a manager in the steel and cement industry, and was a member of the board of the \\"Roheisen-Verband\\" (Pig iron association). Due to these commitments, he decided to concentrate on training horses and dressage riders rather than participate in competition himself. Among his first students were his son Uwe and his daughter Alexa, as well as Margit Otto-Cr√©pin and Italian rider Pia Lau. Beginning in 1986, he began to work with Nicole Uphoff, and a year later she first won a Grand Prix Sp√©cial in Lausanne, with Rembrandt. Several national and international awards followed. In 1986 he also began to coach Isabell Werth, whom he asked to ride his own horses, including Gigolo FRH, The collaboration lasted until 2001, when Werth left to work with another trainer. Werth, however, continued to identify Schulten-Baumer as one of the most significant influences on her career. Part of the reason for the split was linked to \\"problems\\" between Werth and Ellen Schulten-Baumer, his stepdaughter, who thereafter took over the training of two horses previously assigned to Werth. Ellen Schulten-Baumer went on to compete in the European Dressage Championships in both 2007 and 2009. He also helped develop and train a number of promising young dressage horses, including Gigolo FRH whom he purchased in 1989 and was successfully shown by Werth to four gold and two silver Olympic medals. Schulten-Baumer owned the horse until its death in 2009. He also developed and promoted the horse Satchmo, which he purchased as a two-year-old.  Awards  The Deutsche Reiterliche Vereinigung (German Equestrian Federation), a member of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports, awarded him the title \\"Reitmeister\\" (Riding Master) on 28 August 2005, a title given in recognition of exceptional achievements. Other awards included the 1974 Grand Medal of the Pferdesportverband Rheinland (Equestrian Association of the Rhineland, PSVR), the 1981 Silver Plaque for Exceptional Achievement in equestrian sport, and 1988 St. Georgs-Plakette (Badge of St. George's) from the PSVR. In 1992 and 1997 he was proclaimed Trainer of the Year by the International Dressage Trainers' Club (IDTC). At the 2005 CHIO Aachen he was awarded the \\"Silbernes Pferd\\" (Silver Horse) for his lifetime achievement and the German Rider's Cross in Gold. In 2007, he won the P.S.I. Award in recognition of his work selecting and training talented young horses for dressage and show jumping. In 2009, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Twice, in 1999 and 2002, he won the Otto-L√∂rke-Preis of the Deutsches Olympiade-Komitee f√ºr Reiterei for the most successful rising young Grand Prix horse of the year.  Rollkur  Schulten-Baumer is considered by some to be the inventor of the controversial \\"deep and round\\" training method known as Rollkur, or hyperflexion. However, both proponents and opponents of Rollkur have disagreed on this point. Sjef Janssen, the Dutch national team dressage coach and spouse of Anky van Grunsven, both known for their use of Rollkur, stated that the Rollkur system Janssen created was \\"totally different\\" from the training techniques of Schulten-Baumer. German Olympic team member Klaus Balkenhol, now dressage coach for the United States Equestrian Team and opponent of Rollkur training, also stated: \\"There were horses in Germany, which have been set low, for example, those from the training of Dr. Schulten-Baumer, but there was always the stretching and relaxation in the forehand. But what Sjef Janssen did in recent years, was something else.\\"  References  Bibliography  * 1926 births 2014 deaths German male equestrians Dressage trainers Recipients of the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"Uwe Schulten-Baumer"},{"id":"36092487","title":"Holly Quin-Ankrah"},{"id":"36092508","text":"Mar√≠a Teresa Lara Aguirre del PinoSong: Piensa en m√≠ (Tlatlauquitepec, 1904 ‚Äì May 23, 1984) was a Mexican lyricist and composer.Mar√≠a Teresa Lara  Family  Lara was a daughter of Joaqu√≠n M.

They would have been shot without the intervention of the sanctuary. The sanctuary now rescues and provides a final home for many types of unwanted animals, in particular chimpanzees, baboons, spider monkeys, capuchins and marmosets. As the animals that they rescue are not able to survive in the wild, they try to make the rest of the animals' lives as enjoyable as possible. The sanctuary has a policy of not breeding any animals.

It is possible that Jackson also served as chaplain on Sir John Norris and Sir John Gibsone's 1697 expedition to the island. Initially, Jackson's salary of fifty pounds per annum depended on tithes from the civilian population, but by 1703 he was recognized by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. He arrived to a tense atmosphere, pitting officers against their soldiers and the town's civilians. Jackson consistently opposed the officers and was accused of sowing \\"discord among the inhabitants\\". Jackson repeatedly wrote to his superiors in England complaining about the behaviour of the officers, including Michael Richards and Thomas Lloyd. Over the winter of 1704-1705 a group of officers, including Richards and Lloyd, complained to the Board of Trade in London that Jackson was a disruptive influence and requested his recall. In 1705 Jackson and his family (now eleven children) left Newfoundland aboard Falkland. The ship ran aground in Sandwich Bay, Kent. No lives were lost, but the family lost most of their possessions. In 1709 Jackson took a post as curate in Dursley, Gloucestershire. He married a woman named Mary Bissett in 1710. (The fate of his first wife is unknown; she may have died in Newfoundland.)

It was developed by Russian engineer Mikhail Tsiferov in 1948. Proposed uses for the device included drilling shallow holes for mineral exploration, construction, underground gasification of coal, water and methane drainage. The initial design called for an autonomous device equipped with a drill head that would be rotated by expanding gases generated by a propellant burning inside a combustion chamber, in a manner similar to a Segner wheel. As the hot gases escaped the slits in the drill head at high speeds, they would break down the ground in front of the device. Experiments have shown the device could achieve drilling speed of 5 metres per minute through solid rock and up to 100 metres per minute in soil. In 1970, Soviet geologist Vladimir Smirnov said, the device \\"may well bring about a revolution in the facilities for penetrating the interior of the earth\\". While a number of experimental prototypes were made and tested, the device has not seen production. Prototype Further development led to the first prototype, built in 1968. The device consisted of a cylindrical shell filled with solid propellant, with a number of de Laval nozzles installed in the nose cone. The rocket was positioned nose down and the propellant ignited; hot gases escaped through the nozzles at supersonic speeds. Nozzles aimed downwards were responsible for demolition of the ground underneath the rocket; the next series of nozzles, aimed sideways, expanded the drilled well. Gas escaped between the device's shell and the walls of the well at speeds of up to 100 m/s, carrying along chunks of pulverized rock up to 15 cm across. In the process, the gas significantly cooled down through contact with the shaft's walls. Most of the energy contained in the propellant (5 to 100 thousand hp) was spent on the actual digging, while the device lowered itself deeper into the well under its own weight. Tsiferov's device was capable of drilling the well tens of metres deep and 250‚Äì1000 mm in diameter, depending on the type of soil. Experiments have demonstrated that the device is able to drill holes not only in regular soil, but through solid rock, permafrost, ice and aquifers. Fuels=Solid The solid fuel version of the device was limited by the volume of propellant it could carry, which was sufficient for 5 to 20 seconds of operation, enough to create a well up to 20 metres deep. The inventor saw further progress in moving on to liquid fuel rockets, expecting their operational time to be measured in tens of minutes, with potential to be eventually increased to a few hours. Tsiferov's device was exhibited at VDNKh- USSR; the inventor was promoted to receive the exhibition's gold medal. The device and drilling method were patented in a number of countries, including USA (1975-1976) and Canada (1977-1978). One of the disadvantages of the rocket drill was poor control, as the fluctuations in the ground composition along its way could severely affect its trajectory. Eventually, a device to control the underground rocket's trajectory was patented. In addition, an auxiliary device for collection of core samples was patented. Liquid In 1980s, under the supervision of the original inventor's son, Vladimir Tsiferov, the liquid-fuel version of the underground rocket was developed, fueled by gasoline-water mixture and oxygen. The most notable feature of this design was its simplicity and ease of manufacturing; except for the drilling head with nozzles, it mostly used off-the-shelf parts. This rocket was capable of drilling a well 10 m deep and 1/2 m in diameter within one minute. According to Soviet geologist Lev Derbenev, this version of the rocket, \\"jet drilling device\\", weighs 17 times less than a comparable drilling rig, requires 3 times less fuel, and has 6 to 9 times greater productivity; a single device would provide cost savings of up to 42,000 roubles (53,000 US dollars) in 1984 prices.

He spoke Spanish, English, French, and Italian.Bendfeldt, Manola Sandoval. Personal Interview. March 6, 2014. His musical works contributed greatly to both countries, and he is viewed as a musical ambassador of Guatemala. Early life Miguel Sandoval was born in the town of Guazacap√°n, Guatemala (in the department of Santa Rosa) on November 3, 1902. Fray Angel Cabrera, who was a priest and his mother's uncle, supervised Sandoval's primary education. Sandoval's musical resources were limited in the small town where he grew up. He had access to a home piano, which he began playing when he was age 10, the church harmonium, and two phonographs owned by wealthy members of the community. As a young boy, he was fascinated by the military bands and marimba orchestras who played on national holidays and feast days. In 1912, Sandoval and his mother moved to Guatemala City, where he attended the private Anglo- German high school. In 1917, an earthquake devastated Guatemala City, leaving buildings in rubble and thousands of Guatemalans homeless. All schools in Guatemala City were closed, so with the help of Fray Cabrera, Sandoval enrolled in St. John's College, a Jesuit school in the neighboring city of Belice. At age 14, Sandoval was able to help pay his school expenses by teaching piano at St. John's. Sandoval stayed at St. John's for two years, briefly returned to Guatemala City, and then traveled on a steamer to the United States. Journey to the United States In 1918, Sandoval arrived in New York City with nothing but $50 in his pocket. At this time, New York was just entering the Roaring Twenties ‚Äì with rise of jazz, the foxtrot, the Charleston, and the tango.AP obituary article in Daytona Beach Morning Journal etc. 25 August 1953Willi Apel Harvard dictionary of music 1969 Page 361 \\"GUATEMALA - ...In the succeeding generation the most important figures are Miguel Sandoval (1903-53), a pianist and composer, mainly of film music; Salvador Ley ..\\"The Music magazine/Musical courier: Volumes 147-148 1953 \\"Miguel Sandoval, composer, was to have conducted the program, which besides dances for Mr. Greco and his ensemble listed as orchestral offerings Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain, Chabrier's Espana and the Intermezzo from Granados' ...\\" The United States was in a time of musical transition, due to the growing popularity of the phonograph and the radio. In New York City, Sandoval worked as an arranger, choral coach, and pianist for the Italian Theatre Circuit of New York, playing piano in small theatres and nightclubs on the side. In addition, he published a few of his musical works, which were mostly arrangements of Italian folk songs. At this time, Dime Mari? appeared in sheet music, pianola roll, and disc. After six years in the United States, Sandoval became a U.S. citizen. With the help of Mario Cozzi, a tenor and secretary to Giuseppe Bambosheck, conductor at the Metropolitan Opera Sandoval became the assistant conductor of the Met. He held this post for two seasons during the era of Gatti-Casazza. Sandoval also became a member of ASCAP, The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers.Bendfeldt, Manola. Personal Interview. March 6, 2014. On September 26, 1926, Sandoval made his debut as a U.S. concert artist in an appearance with Carmen Ponselle at City Hall in Meriden, Connecticut. After that performance, he became an accompanist and virtuoso pianist, and his compositions were added to many musicians‚Äô repertoires. These musicians included: Lawrence Tibbett, Gloria Swanson, Dorothy Kirsten, Licia Albanese, Giovanni Martinelli, Leonard Warren, Grace Moore, Rosa Ponselle, Ezio Pinza, and Bidu Say√£o. In 1927, Sandoval signed a contract with the Italian tenor, Beniamino Gigli. The two toured extensively and gave as many as sixty concerts a year. They performed in all 48 states, including Havana, Cuba. Sandoval wrote two songs for Gigli to be performed in concert: Vurria and Eres T√∫. Eres T√∫ was recorded on an RCA Victor label, along with Sandoval's arrangement of a tango in D by Alb√©niz, called Quisiera Olvidar Tus Ojos. The association between Sandoval and Gigli was extremely beneficial for Sandoval, as he began attracting a group of admirers similar to that of Gigli. On January 21, 1931, in Toronto, Ontario, a reviewer wrote: ‚ÄúMr. Miguel Sandoval‚Äôs piano-forte work was just as remarkable as Mr. Gigli‚Äôs beautiful songs. There have been few accompanists in Massey Hall who played more exquisitely, with more refined self-forgetfulness, and with more real understanding of the singer‚Äôs moods and needs than he did.‚ÄùSchroeder, Pollyanna, \\"The America's Magazine,\\" April 1979. Between his tours, Sandoval coached singers at his New York Studio, and in 1927, the New York radio station, WCDA, named him Artistic Director. Family Life In 1928, Sandoval married Fedora Cozzi, who was originally from Florence, Italy. Cozzi was well connected with Italian musical circles in New York and was the sister of famous musician, Mario Cozzi. Cozzi became Sandoval's strongest support, as she traveled with him, safeguarded his manuscripts, and encouraged him through the difficulties of the Great Depression. Sandoval and Cozzi had a daughter together, named Manola Bendfeldt n√©e Sandoval, who was born on August 24, 1929.Bendfeldt, Manola Sandoval. Personal Interview. March 6, 2014. Tours Around the United States In 1932, Sandoval's association with Gigli ended as a result of the Metropolitan Opera's request for Gigli to take a salary cut. Sandoval was then taken on as an accompanist to Nino Martini, a young, charismatic singer who was eagerly sought after. The two toured together throughout the United States and Canada, performing Sandoval's compositions, including Papillon, Cuban Dance, and Tarantelle. Other performance pieces included Campanella by Liszt-Busoni and Reflets dans L‚ÄôEau by Debussy. After his tours, Sandoval became even more popular. He spent his time between New York and Hollywood and began composing songs for films. He composed Delusione for the movie Here‚Äôs to Romance and the score for the film Gay Desperado, in which he also appeared on screen as an orchestra leader. Additionally, Sandoval wrote the following popular songs: Adios Mi Tierra, Sin Tu Amor, and Ave Maria, Sandoval also wrote background music for travel films, sports shorts, and newsreels. Meanwhile, Sandoval kept busy in the Eastern United States as well, arranging special operatic adaptations for the New York radio station, WOR. He also conducted operatic performances for the Chicago Opera Company at the Hippodrome in New York, the Century Grand Opera in Providence, Rhode Island, the Cola Santo Associated Artists at the Cosmopolitan Theatre in New York, and the Cincinnati Opera Company at Nippert Stadium in Ohio. From 1940 until 1947, Sandoval worked as a composer, conductor, and pianist for the Columbia Broadcasting System, where he wrote music and conducted for '‚ÄôHacia un Mundo Mejor‚Äô‚Äô, '‚ÄôRadioteatro‚Äô‚Äô, Contraespionaje‚Äô‚Äô, and ‚ÄòViva America‚Äô‚Äô- in collaboration with the musical director Alfredo Antonini and the accordionist John Serry Sr.. These were all transmitted through the shortwave to Spanish- speaking audiences around the world as part of the State Department's cultural diplomacy initiatives during World War II.Media Sound & Culture in Latin America.

In 1946, he returned to Guatemala with his family and discovered that his childhood friend, Juan Jos√© Arevalo had been inaugurated president the year before. During his visit, Sandoval accepted the post of director of the National Radio Station, TGW. Sandoval wanted to use TGW as a tool to help broaden and strengthen the cultural and musical life of his country. He formed the TGW Orchestra and developed a series of classical and folk music programs to be transmitted throughout Guatemala. One of his favorite projects was a shortwave program called Chapinlandia, which was created to reach Guatemalans living abroad. Sandoval composed a short instrumental piece, called Chipinitas, which became the program's theme song. In 1947, Sandoval composed a prelude to honor the Guatemalan musicologist, Jes√∫s Castillo. This piece won first prize at the Quetzaltenango Floral Games that year. During Arevelo's term in office, cultural effervescence spread throughout Guatemala, and a new Guatemalan Ballet Company and a National Opera Company were established. Performances for these new organizations were scheduled in June, July, and August, and this enabled them to attract many talented U.S. artists, as the summer months were slower in the U.S. music industry. Sandoval worked as the producer, producer, promoter, and accountant for the Opera Company. During his time at the Opera Company, he hired young Guatemalan performers, giving them exciting, new opportunities. Return to the United States In 1949, Sandoval signed a contract with the National Concert Artists Corporation of New York and return to the United States in 1951. There he worked with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Lewisohn Stadium Orchestra.The New York Philharmonic Leon Levy Digital Archive Miguel Sandoval in Lewisohn Stadium Concert Programs on nyphil.org Additionally, he produced operas in Havana, Cuba. On July 21, 1953, Sandoval suffered a severe heart attack while conducting a rehearsal of his Danza del Contrabandista in Lewisohn Stadium Orchestra. A month later, on August 24, 1953, Sandoval died at Knickerbocker Hospital in New York. Legacy Sandoval's death was reported on the front page of the New York Times. The catalogue of his compositions includes seven piano works, twenty art songs, two Spanish song cycles, and a collection of twenty-five Latin American songs arranged for voice and piano. The collection of Sandoval's works, which is now the property of Manola Sandoval Bendfeldt, who lives in Mclean, Virginia,Bendfeldt, Manola Sandoval. Personal Interview. March 6, 2014. contains instrumental compositions in manuscript, choral arrangements, film music, and even commercial jingles. His most famous works were his Spanish art songs, his ‚Äò‚ÄôLittle Pedro Suite‚Äô‚Äô, a series of Latin American children's songs, and his orchestral Danza del Contrabnadista. Sandoval was able to produce an impressive number of published compositions, even while working as an accompanist and a conductor. He was inspired by popular and folk music of Spain, and he used idiomatic melodies for his themes. His musical style followed De Falla, Alb√©niz, and Granados of Spain, but he was never afraid to write music the way he felt, whether or not the style was popular at the time. He composed in a conventional manner, always valuing fluidity and melody in his compositions. Miguel Sandoval's music was so influential that it is still performed all over the world.

Plot Deborah Chandler Clark watches police drag a North Carolina river for her body. She recounts the events that brought her to this, beginning when her father, a mill owner, disapproved of a romance between Deborah and the mill's general manager, Seldon Clark. Her father falls to his death at the mill. Seldon consoles her and proposes. On their honeymoon, a jealous and angry woman named Patricia Monahan turns up and claims she's been romantically involved with Seldon, insisting he married Deborah simply to gain control of her mill. Deborah demands an annulment of the marriage. While leaving, the brakes fail on her car. She leaps out just before it crashes into the river. Believing she would be unable to prove her husband's guilt, Deborah disappears, moving to Knoxville and going by the name Ann Carter. An ex- soldier, Keith Ramsay, seems interested in Ann and follows her. What he's really interested in is a $5,000 reward offered by her husband. At a hotel hosting a crowded convention, Seldon nearly succeeds in killing his wife. Keith finally realizes that Deborah is in genuine danger. Patricia can confirm her story, so Deborah tracks her down. Patricia betrays her, however, still being in love with Seldon. At the mill, he attempts to throw Deborah to her death the same way he murdered her father. In the darkness, he mistakenly kills Patricia instead, and dies himself after a fight with Keith.

He wrote, \\"Although it never pretends to be anything but melodrama, Woman in Hiding, unlike so many offerings in this genre, adds some convincing characterizations to its suspense. The combination of the two attributes succeeds in raising this new arrival at the Criterion a notch or two above the normal in this category emanating from the Coast. And, aside from a climax which is something less than inspired, Michael Gordon's direction of this story of a newlywed's desperate flight from her homicidal husband is paced toward mounting tension despite some implausible aspects here and there.\\"Crowther, Bosley.

Founded in 1993 by Chris Wellens and Marshall Rose, it was the first company formed specifically to test network protocol compliance. Its products and tests allow computer devices from many different companies to communicate over networks. Products InterWorking Labs' Products diagnose, replicate, and re-mediate application performance problems. The company's first product, SilverCreek, tests a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent implementation (switch, server, phone) with hundreds of thousands of individual tests, including conformance, stress, robustness, and negative testing. The tests detect and diagnose implementation errors in private and standard MIBs as well as SNMPv1, v2c, and v3 stacks and implementations. The Maxwell family products emulate real world networks, with problems such as delays, rerouting, corruption, impaired packets or protocols, Domain Name System delays or limited bandwidth. New impairments are added to Maxwell using C, C++, or Python extensions. It is controlled via graphical, command line, and script interfaces. It supports a set of protocol impairments for TCP/IP, DHCP, ICMP, TLS, and SIP testing. The Maxwell products are named after Maxwell's Demon, a thought experiment by 19th century physicist James Clerk Maxwell. Maxwell‚Äôs Demon demonstrated that the Second Law of Thermodynamics‚Äîwhich says that entropy increases‚Äîis true only on average. In his thought experiment, Maxwell imagined a double chamber with a uniform mixture of hot and cold gas molecules. A demon (some intelligent being) sits between the two chambers operating a trap door. Every time a cold (low-energy) molecule comes by, the demon opens the door and lets the molecule through to the other side. Eventually, the cold gas molecules are all on one side of the chamber and the hot ones all on the other. Although the molecules continue to move randomly, the introduction of intelligence into the system reduces entropy instead of increasing it. The Maxwell product sits in the middle of a network conversation and opens or closes a figurative \\"door\\" on the basis of specific criteria. Maxwell intelligently modifies the packet based on pre- selected criteria and sends the packet on its way. InterWorking Labs is advised by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Maxwell's network emulations reproduce real conditions in the lab before products are deployed. History InterWorking Labs was co-founded in 1993 by Chris Wellens and Marshall Rose. The two met in 1992 at the Interop Company, in Mountain View, California, where Wellens was Director of Technology and Rose was on the Interop Program Committee and also Working Group Chair of the IETF for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Wellens‚Äîwho was overseeing the trade fair's 5000-node InteropNet as well as an array of interoperability demonstrations for network protocols‚Äî noticed that engineers from different companies often interpreted network protocols differently and ended up struggling to make their products send and receive data to one another‚Äîsometimes just minutes before showcase demonstrations. The engineers asked Interop to create an interoperability lab where these network communication issues could be worked out in a private and less stressful environment. Interop's founder and CEO Dan Lynch concluded that the industry needed an interoperability testing lab. Lynch asked Wellens to write a business plan for a permanent Interoperability Lab. Rose proposed that the Lab's first task should be to create and try out a set of tests of the SNMP protocol, since SNMP was an area he was familiar with and one where engineers were having particular problems at Interop. Wellens volunteered to organize a group of developers for an interoperability test summit if Rose would create a set of tests and assist in developing the initial plan. At about the same time, however, Ziff-Davis acquired Interop and chose not to proceed with the Interoperability Lab. Wellens and Lynch agreed that she should pursue the idea on her own. In 1993, Wellens established InterWorking Labs, and, in January 1994, organized the first SNMP interoperability test summit using 50 SNMP tests written by Rose. During that first test summit, a large number of implementations failed Rose's tests.. The results persuaded several major corporations that interoperability testing would be a critical component of functioning networks. Participants at the second (1994) SNMP Test Summit included Cabletron Systems, Cisco Systems, Eicon Technology, Empirical Tools and Technologies, Epilogue Technology Corp., Fujitisu OSSI, IBM and IBM Research, Network General Corp., PEER Networks, SNMP Research, SynOptics Communications, TGV, Inc., and Wellfleet Communications. In 2000, Wellens asked Karl Auerbach to join the InterWorking Labs Board of Directors. In 2002, Wellens hired Auerbach, who was part of Cisco's Advanced Internet Architecture group, to serve as chief technology officer at InterWorking Labs. An advisory board consisted of several members of the IETF who have expertise in networking protocols (Andy Bierman, Jeff Case, Dave Perkins, Randy Presuhn, and Steve Waldbusser). Markets Wireless networks used by hospitals, police, and military have turned computer networks into essential lifeline utilities. Computer networks that keep economies, transportation, energy, and food supplies flowing commonly belong to the critical infrastructure of a region. As such, the performance of networks under adverse conditions is a significant concern for militaries, industry, and local and regional governments. According to Wellens, UCITA has significantly protected software publishers from liability for the failure of their products. But software publishers may become increasingly liable for the consequences of network failures‚Äîespecially where comprehensive networking testing existed and was not used. Online retailers, for example, can demonstrate multimillion-dollar losses due to network problems such as security flaws or a network collapse after a denial of service attack.

His funeral left from his residence in Dauphin Terrace, Highgate Hill and he was buried in Toowong Cemetery. Business life Benjamin Harris Babbidge was a blacksmith, having completed an apprenticeship with the shipbuilders J. & W. White of Cowes. After three years in Newcastle, New South Wales, he relocated to Moreton Bay where he worked for John Petrie for a number of years. In 1865 he established his own business as a ship's smith. In 1881 he successfully tendered to construct 25 goods wagons for the railways. This was a new line of business for him and he established a railway rolling stock workshop at Hope Street, South Brisbane for this purpose. In 1885, his workshop assembled Brisbane's first tram cars (the cars themselves being imported from America). Public life Babbidge was an alderman of the Brisbane Municipal Council from 1879 to 1886.

She was the first female lawyer from New Hampshire, and she paved the way for women to be accepted into the bar in New Hampshire. She was also the first woman to run for governor in that state, and the first woman to apply for a federal foreign ambassadorship post. She made significant and lasting contributions to the issues of women's rights and irreligion through her actions and her writings.  Early life  Marilla Marks Young was born in 1840 in New Durham, New Hampshire. Her mother, Sarah Young, was a devoted Free Will Baptist, and her father, Jonathon Young, was a freethinker. Jonathon taught her to think independently and to be curious, taking her to town meetings and courtrooms.\\"Marilla M. Ricker\\", The Boston Business Folio, 1895, p. 126. She was educated at Colby Academy in New London, New Hampshire. During Sundays in the summer, Marilla would accompany her father to the family farm to perform practical activities. This demonstrated an explicit rejection of the values of her mother's church concerning the Sabbath. At the age of ten, she later wrote, Marilla attended a \\"fiery\\" Baptist sermon about hell, after which she swore that she would never believe in God again: \\"Do you wonder that I, a child of ten years, said to my father, who was a freethinker, infidel, atheist, or whatever else you please to call him: 'I hate my mother's church. I will not go there again.'\\" During the Civil War, Marilla offered her services as a nurse for the Union Army, but she was turned down due to her lack of medical training. Her only brother's death during the fighting, she later recalled, was her \\"first real sorrow\\". Indeed, \\"it did more towards checking her exuberant spirit than all else, in fact she says the world has always seemed a little different ever since.\\"The Boston Business Folio, p. 125. Marilla also had two sisters, about whom almost nothing is known. As she could not tend to the wounded soldiers, Ricker devoted as much time and money as she could to sending clothes and other goods to aid the war effort.  Adult life  By the time of the war ‚Äì and indeed since the age of sixteen ‚Äì she had become a teacher in local schools in the towns of Lee and Dover. She refused to read from the Bible during class, preferring instead the literary works of Emerson. The school committee approached Ricker and informed her that she was required to read from the Bible in class. Ricker refused to hide her freethought beliefs, and left the teaching profession.Dorothy Thomas, \\"Ricker, Marilla Marks Young\\", in Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, ed. Edward James (Cambridge: Belknap Press, 1971), p. 154. In 1863, Marilla Young married John Ricker, a man 33 years her senior. She became a widow, however, five years later. The inheritance left to her by John made her financially independent. Unfortunately, very little is known about John Ricker. It seems likely that he was a freethinker and a supporter of women's rights, as she later wrote: \\"Give me then the man who is not a Christian, and who has no religion, for if the man who loves his wife and children, who gives to them the strength of his arm, the thought of his brain, the warmth of his head, has not religion, the world is better off without it, for these are the highest and holiest things which man can do.\\"Marilla Ricker, I Don't Know, Do You? (East Aurora, N.Y.: The Roycrofters, 1916), p. 135. In 1872, Ricker travelled to Germany and remained in Europe until 1876. The reasons for this excursion are unknown. Biographers disagree on what she accomplished on her travels, suggesting that she either engaged with European freethought movements or simply wanted to learn new cultures and languages.Bennie DeWhitt, \\"A Wider Sphere of Usefulness: Marilla Ricker's Quest for a Diplomatic Post,\\" Prologue: The Journal of the National Archives 5, no. 4, (1973), p. 203. All Ricker tells us is that she \\"became conversant with the outside doings of the Roman Catholic Church.\\"Ricker, I Don't Know, p. 41. Upon her return to Washington, D.C., she decided to study law (read law). In a remarkably short time, she gained prominence as a competent and compassionate member of the profession. Ricker worked on the famous Star Route trial with Robert Ingersoll ‚Äì perhaps the United States' most well-known agnostic. Ricker's legal career was also bound up with her freethought. In a losing cause, Ricker attempted to remove Washington's old Sunday law requiring shops to close in observance of the Sabbath.LeeAnn Richey, \\"Reading Between the Lines: Marilla Ricker in the Struggle for Women's Rights\\" (Unpublished dissertation, Stanford University, 2002), p. 19. During her career as a lawyer, Ricker became a strong advocate of prisoners' rights, and later received the nickname \\"the prisoner's friend\\". In 1879, she sought a hearing to protest the conditions in state prisons.Richey 2002, p. 18. The Boston Globe praised her charity, noting that she \\"spent her entire income, beyond the actual necessary expenses of her personal maintenance, in these noble efforts.\\"Boston Globe, July 7, 1878, p. 2. She made especial efforts to represent accused individuals who could not afford legal help, very often charging no fees to her clients. When Ricker applied, in 1910, to run for governor of New Hampshire, and when she applied, in 1897, for the position of ambassador to Colombia, she had no realistic hopes of being granted these posts. Rather, she was attempting to bring public attention to the fact that women were systematically excluded from positions for which they were equally qualified as men. \\"Whether I secure the appointment or not,\\" she said of her ambassadorship application, \\"I have established a precedent in asking for it.\\" She justified her application in explicitly egalitarian terms: \\"there is no gender in brain, and it is time to do away with the silly notion that there is.\\"Boston Globe, May 23, 1897, p. 25.  Ideologies: Women's rights and freethought  Inscription by Marilla Ricker in a copy of The Four Gospels. The inscription reads: \\"I advocate equal pay for equal work, and no woman can afford to be indifferent to anything that degrades women. I also advocate equal taxation and a steeple is no more to be excluded from taxation than a smoke stack.\\" In 1869, the year after her husband's death, Ricker attended the first National Woman Suffrage Association convention, organized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. This marked a new period of active suffragist work in her life. Explicitly asserting her belief in the equality of all peoples, Ricker acted upon these beliefs by attempting to vote in her hometown of Dover, New Hampshire, in 1870 ‚Äì the first woman to do so. She continued to hand in her ballot for consecutive decades until the end of her life. Ultimately, she was willing to \\"tackle anything\\" for woman suffrage, \\"from a buzz saw to a bishop.\\"Marilla Ricker, \\"A Job Lot of Anti-Suffragists,\\" Dover Tribune, December 7, 1911. Religion was, for Ricker, the ideological source of gender inequality in American society. \\"Let come what will come,\\" she wrote, \\"no man, be he priest, minister or judge, shall sit upon the throne of my mind, and decide for me what is right, true, or good.\\"Ricker, I Don't Know, pp. 45, 95, 106. Freethinking suffragists believed that the interference of religion in the effort to obtain the vote for women would delay or even prevent the movement from achieving its goal. Thus, Ricker wrote, \\"I wish the ministers would keep out of the woman suffrage movement. They do more harm than good. Why, things have come to this pass, that at every meeting of women in behalf of suffrage some minister opens the meeting with prayer; in the middle of discussion there is another prayer; and then at the close of deliberations you hear a third prayer. No wonder the men laugh and call the meetings of woman suffragists' prayer meetings.\\"\\"The Persistency of Mrs. Ricker,\\" Boston Sunday Herald, September 9, 1906. Annie Laurie Gaylor has argued in her collection of writings by female freethinkers that \\"the women's movement has not acknowledged the debt it owes to the unorthodox, freethinking women in its ranks. Their non-religious views often have been suppressed, as if shameful, when in fact repudiation of patriarchal religion is an essential step in freeing women.\\" Indeed, \\"the status of women and the history of the women's rights movement cannot be understood except in the context of women's fight to be free from religion ... if there was one cause which had a logical and consistent affinity with freethought, it was feminism.\\"A. L. Gaylor (ed.), Women Without Superstition: \\"No Gods ‚Äì No Masters\\" (Madison, WI.: Freedom from Religion Press, 1997), pp. xiii-xv.  Freethought author  During the 1910s, Ricker remained in New Hampshire and, perhaps due to failing health, concentrated on publishing articles and books elucidating her freethought beliefs. Much of her writing focused upon the detrimental influence of the church on society. Not only did the churches own more than \\"13 billions\\" of property, on which they were too \\"dishonest\\" to pay taxes, they also were responsible for pervasive inequality and the fact that \\"human freedom is but half won.\\"Ricker, I Don't Know, p. 44. Ultimately, her publications extolled the goals toward which she had been working for her entire life: \\"I am a freethought missionary, and I am doing my 'level best' to drive superstition, alias Christianity, from the minds of mankind.\\"Marilla Ricker, I'm Not Afraid, Are You? (East Aurora, N.Y.: The Roycrofters, 1917), pp. 34, 82, 103. Ricker often wrote the same phrase in the front of her books, especially those that she donated to libraries: \\"A steeple is no more to be excluded from taxation than a smoke stack.\\"Ricker, I'm Not Afraid, Are You?, p. 120. Her books included I'm Not Afraid, Are You?, The Four Gospels, and I Don't Know, Do You?

History and geography  * A \\"knob\\" is a rounded hill, or mountain, usually found in older mountain ranges. * McAfee Knob is named after James McAfee (Mac-a-fee), a Scotch-Irish immigrant who settled in the Catawba Valley in the late 1730s. * McAfee Knob is the tallest mountain in the area surrounding Catawba, at an elevation of nearly . * Much of Catawba Mountain was open farmland in the mid-1900s. * McAfee Knob's ridge line is covered in a pine forest. * McAfee Knob has been labeled the most photographed point along the Appalachian Trail.  Appalachian Trail  McAfee Knob is located on the Appalachian Trail, a four-mile hike northbound from the intersection with VA-311 in Catawba, Virginia or a hike southbound from US-220 in Troutville, Virginia. The Appalachian Trail is a hiking trail following the Appalachian Mountains between Georgia and Maine, and is a unit of the National Park Service. The McAfee Knob hiking trail is along the Appalachian Trail and is managed by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. This is a part of over of hiking trails in the Roanoke region, which are maintained by the volunteers of the Roanoke Appalachian Trail Club (RATC).  Popular culture  *McAfee Knob is known as the most photographed point of the Appalachian Trail. * McAfee Knob was prominently featured in the 2015 major motion picture A Walk in the Woods, starring Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. McAfee Knob appears on the movie's poster. The movie is based on travel writer Bill Bryson's 1998 autobiographical book, A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail. * McAfee Knob appeared in the October 2015 issue of the international, award-winning UK magazine, Wanderlust. The author of the article traveled the trail with Bill Bryson, stopping at his favorite locations, including McAfee Knob.  McAfee Knob hike = General hiking description  The hike is moderately difficult with a gradual incline. McAfee Knob hiking trail ends on rocky mountain terrain that sticks out on a diving-like platform into the air. The trail offers a 270-degree panorama view of the Catawba Valley. North Mountain is also viewable to the west, the Tinker Cliffs to the north and the Roanoke Valley to the east. The hike is a climb of around and about to the top of the Knob from the VA-311 parking area. As the altitude changes during the uphill part of the hike, it is advised to bring an additional layer of clothing, as it is colder at the summit. The average time it takes to get up and down the mountain is from 4 to 4.5 hours, so it is important to bring plenty of fluids and snacks. The trail offers picnic tables and resting spots throughout. The McAfee Knob trail is most popular in the spring and fall seasons, and there has been an average of around 100 hikers on the trail at once. When hiking the trail in the winter, there will most likely be no one else there. Among other things to encounter are the spikes of frost from the icy moisture that form on objects such as rocks, leaves and frozen soil. The terms used to describe these coverings are \\"rime ice\\" and \\"hoarfrost\\". Rime ice is formed when wind-driven droplets of water collide and freeze on an object like a tree branch on the trail. Hiking in the winter and in the spring are completely different experiences.

She was one of three people sentenced to death for the December 2, 1989 shooting death of her four-year-old son, Christopher Conan Milke. Her alleged conspirators were her roommate James Lynn Styers and his friend Roger Mark Scott. Neither testified against her and both agreed that she was not present at the shooting. Scott implicated Milke as the mastermind while Styers said she had no involvement whatsoever. They implicated each other as the actual shooter. Who that was remains a subject of speculation. With the passage of time Milke's conviction became increasingly polarizing, largely due to the conduct and testimony of Phoenix police detective Armando Saldate Jr. Saldate testified that Milke confessed to him. The alleged confession was uncorroborated, however, and Milke is adamant it did not occur. Saldate was later accused of perjury. Questions about whether a confession was made and whether Milke had voluntarily waived her Miranda rights, Saldate's long history of misconduct, and prosecuting attorney Noel Levy withholding Saldate's personnel record from the defense, became central issues of Milke's appeals. In March, 2013, a three-judge panel of the United States Ninth Circuit Court unanimously overturned Debra Milke's conviction. In their ruling, the judges excoriated the conviction. Milke was released on $250,000 bond that September by Judge Rosa P. Mroz of the Maricopa County Superior Court. County prosecutor Bill Montgomery unsuccessfully appealed the decision to the state supreme court, which blocked a proposed retrial. On March 23, 2015, all charges against Debra Milke were formally dismissed with prejudice by Judge Mroz. Milke has filed a civil wrongful conviction lawsuit. It names the city of Phoenix, Maricopa County, Bill Montgomery, and Armando Saldate, among others, as defendants. Biography Debra Milke (Sadeik) was born in West Berlin, West Germany, to a U.S. Air Force father and a German mother. In 1965 the Sadeik family moved to the U.S., where Milke attended high school and college. She married Mark Milke in 1984 and gave birth to one son, Christopher Conan Milke, in 1985. Debra and Mark divorced in 1988. Murder investigation and conviction In August 1989, Debra Milke and her son Christopher Milke moved into an apartment with Jim Styers, a man she knew through her sister. On December 2, 1989, Styers took 4-year-old Christopher to the Metrocenter mall in Phoenix, Arizona. That afternoon he called Milke, who was doing laundry at the apartment, and told her that the boy had disappeared from the mall. Styers alerted mall security, while Milke dialed 9-1-1. A missing person investigation was launched. The next day Phoenix police arrested Roger Scott, a long-time friend of Styers. After more than fourteen hours of interrogation, Scott admitted that he knew where Christopher was and that the boy was dead. He directed the police to a desert area north of Phoenix, where Christopher's body was discovered. Christopher had been shot three times in the head. According to the lead case detective Armando Saldate Jr., Scott claimed that Styers had committed the murder and that Styers had told him Milke had \\"wanted it done.\\" However, Scott would not testify against Milke at her trial.Debra Milke v. Charles Ryan, decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 14 March 2013 Styers, who had helped in the initial search for Christopher, was arrested and interviewed by police after being implicated by Scott. Milke voluntarily went to the Pinal County sheriff's office where she was interrogated by Saldate. The interrogation was not recorded or witnessed by anyone other than Detective Saldate. Three days later, in a written report of the interrogation, Saldate indicated Milke had confessed to arranging the murder of her son Christopher. Scott was offered a plea-bargain, 21 years in prison for second degree murder, in return for testifying against Milke and Styers. He wanted to take the deal but his lawyer rejected it. Milke was charged with conspiracy to commit first degree murder, kidnapping, child abuse, and first-degree murder. At trial, prosecutors relied on the alleged confession and pointed to a possible motive: Milke had taken out a $5,000 life insurance policy on her son. Milke, however, who worked at an insurance agency, had not purposefully negotiated the policy, but obtained it as a part of her regular employee benefits package. She had discussed the policy with Styers. In October 1990, she was convicted of all charges and sentenced to death. Styers and Scott were charged and tried separately. Both were convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. Appeals In December 2007, the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona filed an amicus brief in support of Milke, who by then had been on death row for 18 years. The brief raised questions \\"regarding the admissibility of uncorroborated and unrecorded confessions\\" by Milke. In September 2009, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that there was \\"no evidence\\" that Milke had \\"voluntarily\\" waived her right to remain silent and ordered federal court judge Robert Broomfield to decide if the case merited a new trial.\\"Will Convicted Child-Killer Debra Milke Win New Trial? We're Betting She Will\\". Valley Fever blog, Phoenix New Times, 12 January 2010. Retrieved 26 June 2012. At the subsequent evidentiary hearing, Broomfield disagreed with the appeals court's opinion and found that Milke had validly waived her Miranda rights. Conviction overturned On March 14, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit threw out Milke's conviction, ruling that Milke did not receive a fair trial.Arizona woman's murder conviction, death sentence overturned. CNN, 2013-03-14. It held that Milke's rights had been violated by the failure to turn over Saldate's personnel file to the defense. That file included multiple instances of misconduct, including eight cases where confessions, indictments or convictions were thrown out because Saldate either lied under oath or violated the suspects' rights during interrogations. The court ruled that because \\"the prosecution did not disclose [the arresting detective] Saldate's history of misconduct,\\" Arizona had violated its obligation to turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense. In their opinion the Circuit Court said, > Milke's alleged confession, as reported by [Pinal County Sheriff's > Detective] Saldate, was the only direct evidence linking Milke to the crime. > But the confession was only as good as Saldate's word, as he's the only one > who claims to have heard Milke confess and there's no recording, written > statement or any other evidence that Milke confessed.

(p. 42) Release from jail On July 8, 2013, Arizona Attorney General's Office announced its intention to retry Milke and seek the death penalty for the murder of her son. Milke was released on September 6, 2013, with a $250,000 bond set by Judge Rosa Mroz of Maricopa County Superior Court. Milke left the jail without talking to reporters, and lived in a house in Phoenix bought by her supporters. On December 18, 2013, Judge Mroz granted Saldate's request to invoke his 5th Amendment right not to testify. Dismissal of charges On December 11, 2014, an Arizona state appeals court ordered the dismissal of murder charges against Milke, ruling that a retrial would result in unconstitutional double jeopardy. On March 17, 2015 the Arizona Supreme Court declined to review the appeal court decision, and on March 23, 2015, Judge Rosa Mroz dismissed the case.

KƒÅ-kƒ´wistƒÅhƒÅw's father, Le Sonnant (M√§hsette Kuiuab), was a leader of the Rabbit Skin people (WƒÅpo≈°wayƒÅnak). Le Sonnant, a medicine man and warrior, was one of the signatories of the 1817 Selkirk Treaty. KƒÅ-kƒ´wistƒÅhƒÅw himself signed Treaty 4, which established reserves for each signatory tribe. In 1881, the tribe's reserve was surveyed. It was situated on the south side of the Qu‚ÄôAppelle Valley, between Round Lake and Crooked Lake. Once the reserve was established, many, including KƒÅ-kƒ´wistƒÅhƒÅw, gave up their traditional buffalo hunting and adopted farming and raising cattle. The reserve's land proved fertile, and the proximity of the Canadian Pacific Railway to the south further increased its value. Periodically the chief came under pressure to sell or surrender part of his territory to white settlers, but KƒÅ-kƒ´wistƒÅhƒÅw steadfastly refused. Like most other Plains Cree leaders, KƒÅ-kƒ´wistƒÅhƒÅw did not participate in the 1885 North-West Rebellion. KƒÅ- kƒ´wistƒÅhƒÅw told his Indian Agent, \\"we will remain on our reserves and attend to our work,\\" and even offered to protect the agent's family should the rebellion endanger them. In 1886, KƒÅ-kƒ´wistƒÅhƒÅw and other \\"loyal\\" chiefs were chosen to travel to Brantford, Ontario, for the unveiling of a memorial to Joseph Brant (Thayendanegea). In 1906 KƒÅ-kƒ´wistƒÅhƒÅw died on his reserve. Only a year after his death the tribe gave up 70% of their land.

Streets in the ward included St Mary's Street, Almshouse Street, St James Street, St James Square, Whitecross Street and Monk Street. The ward existed as a division of the town by the early seventeenth century, and continued into the twentieth century. History In 1804, local author and printer Charles Heath (1761-1830) published his Historical and descriptive accounts of the ancient and present state of the town of Monmouth. In it, he indicated that the borough of Monmouth was divided into four wards: Wye Bridge Ward, Castle Bailey Ward, Monnow Street Ward, and Over Monnow Ward. The same four wards were present in the mid-nineteenth century. The first of those wards, Wye Bridge Ward, was included in the 1610 map of Monmouth by cartographer and historian John Speed (c. 1552 - 1629). In the map legend, Speed referred to the ward as \\"Wy Brid word\\" (pictured). Wye Bridge Ward continued to be a division of the town of Monmouth into the twentieth century. Keith Edward Kissack (1913-2010), author and former curator of the Nelson Museum and History Centre, indicated that, previously, if a building in Monmouth was valued at less than ¬£10, its residents did not have to pay the poor rate. The majority of those excused from those property taxes resided in Wye Bridge Ward. This was particularly true in the area of the wharves which, by the mid nineteenth century, had evolved into a slum. The number of people who had their poor rate taxes waived peaked in 1848. Streets and buildings Whitecross Street extended to \\"the sign of the Griffin\\". Whitecross Street took its name from a cross that once stood in what is now referred to as St James Square. Heath indicated that Wye Bridge Ward at the turn of the nineteenth century started at the residence of the widow Myles, at the north end of St Mary's Street near the church, and extended southeast toward Wye Bridge, including St Mary's Street in its entirety. There were also some homes in proximity to the turnpike, and land in the possession of the Duke of Beaufort. Tenements and lumber yards north of Wye Bridge were part of the ward. The mention of a street with no name where \\"respectable families\\" lived, including the Bourne and Williams families, was a reference to the future St James Street (and St James Square). Heath specified not only the Dixton Gate (East Gate) (pictured in map above), adjacent to the modern St James Square, but also land belonging to Captain Charles Philipps. Philipps built The Grange on St James Street in the nineteenth century; it was converted to a sixth form boarding house for Monmouth School in 2011. While Heath claimed that the future St James Street had no name in the early nineteenth century, William Meyler Warlow asserted in 1899 that St James Street had been part of Whitecross Street, as Whitecross extended from the east end of Church Street all the way to Weirhead Street. The Duke of Beaufort owned some land in that area of the ward as well. The future Almshouse Street, containing the William Jones Alms Houses, as well as \\"parish row\\" and warehouses, was also in Wye Bridge Ward. Almshouse Street was another street that had originally been part of Whitecross Street. The property of the Endall and Hughes families was included in Wye Bridge Ward. The ward comprised the street which extended from the East Gate to \\"the sign of The Griffin,\\" which represented both the east and west segments of the modern Whitecross Street (and St James Square). The Griffin public house, at 1 Whitecross Street (pictured), continues to be located at the southeast corner of the intersection of Church Street (pedestrianised), St Mary's Street, and Whitecross Street. Church Street was referred to as Butchers' Row in the seventeenth century. Whitecross Street took its name from the stone cross that once stood in the area now referred to as St James Square (pictured). It was later replaced by a weighing machine which was present at the turn of the nineteenth century. Later, it was the location of a pump donated in 1873 by Major Alexander Rolls, Mayor of Monmouth. The site of the original cross is marked on Speed's map of the town (pictured in map above). Monk Street was included in its entirety, beginning at the Platt residence and blacksmith shop at the intersection with Whitecross Street and extending north. The ward contained a number of other miscellaneous properties, many of which were located north of Monk Street. Public houses included were The Royal Oak and Manson's Cross, both on Hereford Road. Among the farms was the Priory Farm, later the first site of the Monmouth Golf Club, east of Hereford Road. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the Priory Farm had been the residence of the Powles family, where a Miss Powles died in 1802. Great Manson Farm, including the Great Manson farmhouse, large barn, and old cider house, all grade II listed buildings, was in Wye Bridge Ward. In 1804, it belonged to the Miss Clarkes. The ward also included the Osbaston farms, the residences of the Evans and Wanklyn families. Tump House, owned by James Styants and the residence of the Reverend Willis, was among a number of other properties included in Wye Bridge Ward.

Several temples and charitable institutions in Ahmedabad have been built or founded by members of this mercantile family. Krishna Hutheesing, a sister of Jawaharlal Nehru, was a member of this family by marriage. History The family has a known history of over 250 years. In the mid-1700s, the Mughal empire was in decline, rebellions were breaking out in several places, and general lawlessness prevailed in much of northern India. The traditional trade routes between northern India and central Asia were unworkable. Meanwhile, the European powers had established their trading interests on the coast and this presented a lucrative and safe business opportunity. To meet the changing dynamics of the era, some members of the Jain trading community moved from Osian in the Marwar region of Rajasthan to Khambhat (Cambay) in Gujarat, which was at that time a major port city and a center of the European trade. The progenitors of the Hutheesing family were among the immigrants.[Art connoisseur in the Hutheesing mould, Sunday, 8 July 2001, http://www.gujaratplus.com/news/Ahmedabad/97112.html Move from Marwar to Gujarat] Initially, the wealthy and industrious immigrants were not unwelcome. They ingratiated themselves with the Mughal-appointed governors of Khambhat and prospered to the extent that they soon became the owners of a few ships that sailed abroad for trade. However, this happy situation was not to last long. The group from Osian became involved in certain intrigues and their ships were consequently confiscated by the Mughal authorities. They also lost the goodwill of the local authorities and were unable to carry on their trade in the atmosphere of suspicion and hostility. Ultimately, they abandoned direct involvement with international trade and moved inland, to the large trading city of Ahmedabad, which was ruled by a rival (albeit Mughal- appointed) satrap. Here they became prosperous traders. Seth Hutheesing Hutheesing familyIn Ahmedabad, the community prospered in trade. Perhaps the most prosperous trader among them was Hutheesing, son of Kesarising, who amassed a colossal fortune. Hutheesing was the grandson of one of the men who emigrated from Osian to Khambhat and then to Ahmedabad. He lived during the first half of the 19th century. His descendants (both adopted and biological) took his first name as their surname and came to be known as the \\"Hutheesing family.\\" Hutheesing Kesarising was married three times but neither his first wife nor his second wife produced a living male heir, although there were at least two living daughters and one boy who lived to the age of five, besides some miscarriages and other infant deaths. His third wife (who was much younger than him) produced no child at all for several years after their marriage. This third wife was named Harkunwar and she hailed from the village of Ghogha near Bhavnagar. The two daughters were married at a young age, per the custom of that era, and sent away to live in their marital homes. Thereafter, in keeping with Indian tradition, the couple adopted the three sons of Hutheesing's brother, Dolabhai. The boys were named Jaisingbhai, Maganbhai and Mulchandbhai. Ironically, within a couple of years after the adoptions, Harkunwar finally became pregnant and gave birth to a son, whom they named Umabhai. According to Jain custom and society, their biological son was treated just like his adopted brothers; before his death, Hutheesing portioned out his wealth in equal measure to all his sons, and at his death, it was the eldest adopted boy, Jaising, who officiated at his funeral as his eldest son. Harkunwar Bai After the death of Seth Hutheesing, his sons carried on the family's trading business harmoniously, while his wife, Harkunwar Bai, devoted herself to prayer and charities. The entire family continued to live together in their palatial residence, Hutheesing-ni-Vadi. This was a massive haveli (Indian-style mansion-with-courtyards) built by Huteesing just outside the gates of the old walled city of Amedabad. The mansion stood within a large compound, which contained walled gardens, an orchard, mews and small houses for servants and dependents. Hutheesing had intended to build a grand Jain temple within this compound. Before his death, Hutheesing and Harkunwar had performed the required religious ceremonies and jointly laid the symbolic \\"first stone\\" of the temple. Hutheesing had finalized the layout and plan of the temple and was in the process of arranging finances and engaging craftsmen. The task of bringing his pious dream to fruition fell upon Harkunwar and her sons. It was Harkunwar who supervised the construction of the 52-Jinalaya Hutheesing Jain Temple within the compound of her house.Mangilal Bhutoria, Itihas ki Amar Bel- Oswal, Priyadarshi Prakashan, Calcutta, 1988, p. 372-373 The temple took several years to be built. It is constructed of stone in the traditional way, without steel, cement or mortar. It is richly ornamented with intricate and beautiful stone carvings and is now regarded as one of the architectural treasures of the city. It houses 238 stone images, 83 metal images and 21 yantras.

It occurred to Harkunwar Bai that a Derasar or Jain monastery should be built, which would accommodate the visitors in the first instance and then serve as a center of the Jain faith for all time to come. she decided to build a Derasar, or Jain monastery in the city. The presence of such an institution would add luster and virtue to the beauty of the temple. She mentioned her wishes to her sons, and they readily agreed that it was an excellent idea, and the Dharmanath Derasar was duly built and endowed by them, and its consecration was held a couple of days before the consecration of the temple. The Derasar is situated in the Nisha Pol precinct of Ahmedabad, in the near vicinity of the Hutheesing temple. Harkunvar Bai, who had been much younger than her husband, lived to a ripe old age. After the death of her husband, as a pious Indian widow, she wore only plain white cotton sarees for the rest of her life, entirely gave up all jewelry and ornamentation, and spent a large portion of her waking hours in prayer. She later built two further temples, on a smaller scale, within one kilometer from her house in Ahmedabad. These are the Sambhavnath and Chintamani Parshvanath temples in the Zaveriwad neighbourhood of Ahmedabad. She commissioned the construction of a Gaushala or animal shelter for aged cattle and other animals. She constructed Piaos and Sada-varta shelters near certain Jain temples, where basic food, cool water and a shady shelter were provided free to pilgrims and devotees. She constructed and endowed a Dharamshala, or free pilgrims' inn, at Samet Shikhar, a center of Jain pilgrimage located in distant Jharkhand. She organized and funded pilgrimages for poor Jain families of Ahmedabad to travel to Samet Shikhar. She donated funds towards building the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital.HISTORICAL BACKGROUND http://civilhospitalamdavad.org/?page_id=115 Her pious charities, good works and personal austerity made her a figure of veneration among the people of Ahmedabad.

It is owned and operated by Churchill Downs Inc. Construction started in 1947 as a harness racetrack, and it opened in 1949 with Ocean Downs Racing Association (ODRA) as owner. After two failing years, ODRA began to speculate switching to thoroughbred racing, but that did not happen. In 1986, the Maryland Racing Commission was hesitant to approve race days at Ocean Downs due to the track's management, so the owners of Rosecroft Raceway, a competing harness track in Maryland, purchased Ocean Downs and renamed it Delmarva Downs. In 1987, real estate developer Mark Vogel purchased the racetrack. Ocean Downs went into bankruptcy in 1991, however, and it was sold to Fred Weisman, a California entrepreneur. Weisman died in 1994, and the track was sold again to Cloverleaf Standardbred Owners Association (CSOA) with partnership from Bally Entertainment. After the purchase, the racetrack returned to the former name of Ocean Downs. Two years later, CSOA sold Ocean Downs to Bally Entertainment because the track continued to lose money, and Bally Entertainment expected slot machines to be legalized in the state. That did not happen, and William Rickman purchased Ocean Downs from Bally Entertainment in 2000. Maryland voters approved slot machines in 2008 for five locations, including Worcester County. In 2010, construction of a $45-million casino began, and it opened the following year.  History  The United States saw a nationwide surge of interest in harness racing in the 1940s, fueled largely by the addition of parimutuel betting, electric lights to allow night racing, and development of the mobile starting gate. In 1947, the Maryland General Assembly (MGA) authorized up to 100 days per year of harness racing with no more than 20 racing days at one track. The Ocean Downs Racing Association (ODRA), formed by a group of Eastern Shore promoters, was one of 22 applicants to the Maryland Racing Commission (MRC) for harness racing licenses. Four applications were approved: Ocean Downs, Laurel Raceway, Rosecroft Raceway, and Baltimore Raceway. Work on Ocean Downs began in November 1947, with plans to open the following summer, but they were delayed due to construction difficulties. Completed at a cost of $650,000, Ocean Downs opened on July 25, 1949. The track struggled initially, losing $85,000 in its first two seasons, owing to its remote location compared to the three other harness tracks. The MGA attempted to help by raising the takeout three times in ten years. Rumors surfaced Ocean Downs might switch to thoroughbred racing, and an apparent schism over the idea led to the resignation of half of the board of directors in 1957. A 1969 newspaper advertisement for Ocean Downs The racing seasons at Ocean Downs and the other harness tracks were continually extended over the years to keep pace with other mid-Atlantic tracks. By 1984, harness racing was a year-round sport in Maryland, with Ocean Downs open from May to September. In 1986, the MRC expressed grave concerns about the maintenance of Ocean Downs and said it might not approve the continued licensure of the track's management. Under pressure, the track's president, John Howard Burbage, sold his 68 percent stake to Rosecroft Raceway for $2 million. The track was renamed as Delmarva Downs the following year. In 1987, real estate developer Mark Vogel bought Rosecroft Raceway, and Delmarva Downs along with it. Vogel allegedly diverted funds from the tracks to support failed real estate ventures, and filed for bankruptcy after being arrested on drug charges. California philanthropist Frederick Weisman bought the two tracks out of bankruptcy in 1991. Under Weisman's company, Colt Enterprises, the two tracks continued to fare poorly, losing a total of $4 million in two years, prompting Weisman to place both racetracks up for sale in 1993. Weisman died the next year, and the trustees of his estate were reluctant to invest more money in the tracks, intensifying the need for a buyer. An initial sale agreement was reached with the Cloverleaf Standardbred Owners Association, a group of 1,400 mid-Atlantic horsemen, for a total of $11 million, pending financing. With the deal still pending, Delmarva did not open in May for the 1995 season. Casino operator Bally Entertainment, hoping that Maryland would legalize slot machines at racetracks, entered with a $12 million offer for a controlling interest in the two tracks, with Cloverleaf buying a small stake. Joe De Francis, president of Pimlico and Laurel Park, fearful of outside control of the state's racing industry, made a competing offer of a $1 million loan to help Cloverleaf complete its purchase. The horsemen declined both offers, wary that Bally might have no need to continue racing after a casino were opened. Instead, a deal was reached under which Bally lent Cloverleaf $10.8 million to buy the tracks, and agreed to operate the tracks for seven years, with an option to purchase a 50 percent share if slots were legalized. Delmarva reopened under its new ownership in July. Management changed the name back to Ocean Downs in 1996, stating that \\"nobody related to the name of Delmarva\\", and that it was sometimes confused with Del Mar Racetrack. By late 1996, Cloverleaf was losing $1.2 million annually, mostly at Ocean Downs, and the horsemen were unhappy with Bally's management of Rosecroft. Two months of negotiations were held over restructuring Cloverleaf's debts, selling Ocean Downs to Bally, and turning over operation of Rosecroft to Cloverleaf. A competing offer for the two tracks came from William Rickman, owner of Delaware Park, and De Francis expressed interest as well. A deal was finally reached, which included Bally buying Ocean Downs for $2 million, and agreeing to continue live racing there, contingent on certain legislative relief. The sale was completed in May 1997. Bally quickly \\"launched a war\\" against the state's thoroughbred racetracks, ending its simulcasting of thoroughbred races, and proposing to open an off-track betting parlor in Hagerstown without sharing revenues with the other tracks. That proposal was rejected by the Racing Commission, and a new simulcast agreement was reached in April 1998, prompting De Francis to remark that the two sides were finally \\"working in a peaceful and cooperative manner\\". In 2000, Rickman agreed to buy Ocean Downs from Bally for $5.1 million, including $2.5 million to be put in escrow to cover the track's operating costs. Cloverleaf initially exercised a right of first refusal that it had negotiated as part of the sale to Bally, to be financed by a loan from the Maryland Jockey Club. Cloverleaf and MJC had partnered in a statewide revenue sharing agreement, and hoped to protect their monopoly on Maryland racing, but after performing due diligence, decided the track was losing too much money, and needed too many capital improvements. They stepped aside, and Rickman completed the purchase. Maryland voters in 2008 approved a referendum to allow slot machines at five casinos, with one license allotted to Worcester County. Ocean Downs was the only applicant for the spot and was approved for 800 machines. The casino opened in January 2011 with 750 machines. Ocean Downs announced a planned 50,000-square-foot expansion in September 2013, to include ten table games and a new restaurant. Table games had been authorized in Maryland casinos by a 2012 referendum. The expansion opened in December 2017. In January 2017, Rickman sold the track to a joint venture of Churchill Downs, Inc. and Saratoga Casino Holdings. Churchill Downs took full ownership of Ocean Downs in September 2018, swapping its 25 percent stake in Saratoga for Saratoga's 50 percent stake in the track.

The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year in North America exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies. In 1973 VanGrunsven founded the aircraft manufacturing company Van's Aircraft, and in 2012 became the founding president of the Aircraft Kit Industry Association (AKIA), an American aviation advocacy association.Bernard, Mary and Suzanne B. Bopp: Q&A; with AKIA President Dick VanGrunsven, Kitplanes, Volume 29, Number 12, December 2012, page 28-29. Belvoir Publications. ISSN 0891-1851  Life and career  RV-8A Richard VanGrunsven grew up on a farm near Cornelius, Oregon and is the son of a Portland area farmer. He has seven brothers and sisters. His father had taken flying lessons prior to getting married and his stories inspired Richard and his older brother Jerry to acquire an old Piper J-3 Cub, and later a Taylorcraft. Richard learned to fly in 1956 from a 670-foot airstrip on the farm, acquiring his pilot certificate at age 16. His first aeronautical business was providing wheel pants for Taylorcraft. He graduated from the University of Portland in 1961 with an engineering degree. He then joined the United States Air Force that same year. VanGrunsven originally planned to become a fighter pilot, but a minor color vision problem that would have been acceptable in civilian aviation, but not to the Air Force, led instead to him serving three years as a communications officer. After serving in the Air Force, he worked as a designer for Hyster, an Oregon manufacturer of lift trucks. His free time was devoted to learning more about aviation. He now has earned Chief Flying Instructor, multi-engine, and Airline Transport Pilot ratings and has logged over 12,000 hours of flight time. Towards the mid-1960s, VanGrunsven purchased a Stits Playboy homebuilt aircraft and modified it by installing a larger engine. Later, he modified the aircraft by installing cantilevered aluminum wings with flaps, creating the RV-1 in 1965. A few years later he started a clean-sheet design, the all-aluminum RV-3 single-place aircraft, which VanGrunsven introduced at the 1972 EAA AirVenture Airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where he won the \\"Best Aerodynamic Detailing\\" award for the RV-3. The aircraft set new standards of aircraft performance in the homebuilt industry, and became the genesis design for the rest of the RV- series, all which strongly resemble the RV-3. In 1973 he founded Van's Aircraft. The RV-3 was followed by the RV-4 tandem aircraft in 1979. Van's Aircraft continued to produce new designs with good all-round performance, reasonable costs, and continuous improvement in kit quality, developing the RV series all the way up to the latest aircraft, the 2012 RV-14. VanGrunsven commutes regularly to his company in Aurora, Oregon using aircraft of his own design. His company has sold over 18,000 kits or sets of plans, with over 7,500 aircraft completed. Van's homebuilt designs are built in enough numbers that several groups, such as \\"Freedom Flight\\" and the thirteen-member \\"Team RV\\", have organized all-RV formation demonstration teams. In 2006 VanGrunsven was inducted into the Oregon Aviation Hall of Fame. In November 2013 VanGrunsven was appointed to the board of directors of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA). That same year he, along with Dale Klapmeier, Burt Rutan, Bob Hoover and others, launched a campaign and website made for honoring EAA's former long-time president Tom Poberezny. Flying magazine ranked VanGrunsven 22 on its list of the \\"51 Heroes of Aviation\\" and has labelled him the \\"undisputed leader in kit aircraft manufacturing\\".\\"51 Heroes of Aviation.\\" Flying.

Early life and education Vela Peeva was born on 16 March 1922 to ethnic Bulgarian parents Peyo and Katerina in the village of Kamenitsa, today a neighbourhood of Velingrad. She has three siblings; older brother and sister Yordana and Todor, and younger sister Gera. As a teenager, as she was a bright student, she was sent to live alone in the city of Pazardzhik to attend a prestigious high school, so as to achieve a better future than was possible in her hometown. In 1941, she was accepted at the University of Sofia, where she studied Pedagogy and Geography. However, she did not graduate, as she chose to be a partisan instead.http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Vela+Peeva Life with the Bulgarian Communist Party and death In 1939, Vela joined the Worker's Youth League, a communist organization. In 1943, Vela became a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party and joined an anti-fascist group along with fellow communist partisan Stoyo Kalpazanov and her sister Gera. When Gera fell ill of a cold in 1944, Vela volunteered to take her place in an assignment. The assignment was to collect food from the village of Ladzhene and sneak it up to the partisans in the mountains. After she and Stoyo Kalpazanov had collected the food, they were betrayed on the way back and Stoyo was captured. Vela, seriously wounded, managed to escape and crawl away to a cliff, which she hid under for forty days. A local forest worker brought her food and medicines, and when Vela was just healing, he feared he would be discovered by the fascists and betrayed her. Vela was surrounded by the fascists and is believed to have turned her gun on herself to avoid being captured alive. After her death, the fascists beheaded her body and strode around the nearby villages with Vela's head impaled on a spike. Post-death After beheading Vela, the fascists went to Stoyo Kalpazanov's cell and began interrogating him about the whereabouts of the remaining partisans. However, he remained loyal to them and refused to give any information. He was shot for this. Following Vela's death, she was named a Bulgarian national heroine by the communists and her birthplace was turned into a museum. Her sister, Gera, who had meant to take her place in the anti-fascist activities, wrote a book about her years after her death.

Presented to the public in 2008 by governor and former Rosario mayor Hermes Binner, the Puerto was originally planned to open in 2010, the year of the bicentennial of Argentina's emancipation from Spain. By 2010 the project, with a total budget estimated around 300 million pesos (about 75 million USD at the time), had not advanced.

Delays  Legal and political hurdles arose in the meantime, as the land on the banks of the Paran√° river that was to be taken up by the Puerto belonged to the port of Rosario.

They constitute almost 49% of the population of the Federated States of Micronesia, making them by far the largest ethnic group in the country. Language Their language is Chuukese, which belongs to the Trukic branch of Micronesian languages, which is in turn part of the Malayo-Polynesian language family. The Malayo-Polynesian language family is a subdivision of a wider Austronesian language family, one of the world's primary language families. The language is written in a modified Latin alphabet. Population A 2010 census showed that the Chuukese people were the fastest growing group of Pacific Islanders during the 2000s decade in the United States, increasing from a population of about 700 in the year 2000 to more than 4,000 in time for the 2010 census. Culture= Religion  Although the Chuukese are overwhelmingly Christian, traditional beliefs in spirit possession by the dead still exist. Allegedly, these spirits overwhelmingly possess women, and spirit possession is usually brought on by family conflicts. The spirits, speaking through the women, typically admonish family members to treat each other better. Traditional marriage practices Traditionally, before a man could consider marriage, he needed to have experience in farming, fishing, and boat construction. He also had to be able to build his own house. When he had these skills he would inform his parents that he was ready for marriage; the parents would then search for a suitable young woman to be his wife. When they had decided on a girl, the parents of the man would visit the girl's parents. They would introduce themselves and the purpose of their visit, and discuss possible marriage with the girl's parents. If a marriage was agreed upon, the young man would stay with the girl's parents and the girl would reside with the young man's parents, up until the wedding day. Prior to the marriage, both families would prepare a feast which would be attended by the leaders of their respective families. According to custom, the girl's family would provide enough food for the man's family, and his family would do the same for the girl's. There are some attitudes towards marriage among the Chuukese people that may have been retained from past tradition. While both the man and woman will desire compatible sex partners in marriage, they look even more for good workers. A person incapable of work is unlikely to be successful at marriage in Chuuk. A person is well aware of the character and abilities of those in the community, and selects a partner accordingly. The Legend of Wonip According to legend, five brothers once resided on the island of Faichuuk in the Chuuk lagoon. One day, their father called all the boys to him, and told them about a lost island near Faichuuk. He said that someday they should search for it. Later, after the father died, the brothers decided to look for the island, and searched for three days, but could not find it. The brothers felt that the father's story was not true; all with the exception of the youngest brother. The youngest son believed the father, and set sail by himself in search of the island. After travelling a short distance, he saw a huge white shark that was leading the canoe to the area of the lost island. The boy knew that the shark must be his dead father's ghost. The shark disappeared once the canoe had neared the island. The youngest son lowered his sails and dropped anchor. He then dived deep below the surface of the sea and found the lost island. When he returned to the surface, he boarded his canoe but found that his anchor was stuck and he could not lift it. So finally, he cut the anchor rope and sailed back to his home on Faichuuk. When he returned, he told the other brothers what had happened, and early next morning they sailed off to find the island. When they arrived at the island, the oldest brother swam down and tied a rope to the island. After returning to the boat, he pulled on the rope as hard as he could, but could not raise the island from the bottom. The second brother tried, and then the third and the fourth, but the result was the same - the island could not be raised from the ocean floor. Finally, the youngest brother tugged on the rope and amazingly the island came up to the surface. At that very moment, a black bird flew overhead and called out to the brothers that the island should be called Wonip, and must remain forever the property of the youngest son who had believed his father. About a mile north of Faichuuk sits a small island all by itself. There, the descendants of the youngest brother still live. The island is still called Wonip, the name of the brothers' clan.  Livelihood and housing  The traditional subsistence of the Chuukese is fishing. In modern times, fishing is still a important source of income for families and both men and women engage in the occupation. Traditional Chuukese homes were built using palm thatch where families maintained strong intimate bonds.

It consisted mostly of Italian and Spanish immigrants, along with other nationalities such as Slavs (especially Ukrainians, Poles, and Russians), French, Germans and Swedish among others, including Jews. During this period Argentina saw a huge increase in population.

This population decreased even more in the 19th century, during the Argentine War of Independence and the Argentine Civil Wars. Several Argentines from that time period, such as Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Juan Bautista Alberdi, thought that it was imperative to populate the country. The Constitution of Argentina of 1853 promoted European immigration in its 25th article, which prohibited any barriers on immigration.La inmigraci√≥n europea, seg√∫n Sarmiento y Alberdi As the immigration came from several European countries, there was no single reason that led to the immigrants leaving their home countries.

The star is particularly important, as measurements taken by the Kepler spacecraft indicate that the variations in the star's light curve cover a range from about 0.2% to 1.3% of the star's light being blocked. This indicates that there may be a rapidly disintegrating planet, a prediction not yet conclusively confirmed, in orbit around the star, losing mass at a rate of 1 Earth mass every billion years. The planet itself is about 0.1 Earth masses, or just twice the mass of Mercury, and is expected to disintegrate in about 100-200 million years. The planet orbits its star in just 15.7 hours, at a distance only two stellar diameters away from the star's surface, and has an estimated effective temperature of about 2255 K. The orbital period of the planet is one of the shortest ever detected in the history of the extrasolar planet search. In 2016, the planet was confirmed as part of a data release by the Kepler spacecraft. Nomenclature and history Prior to Kepler observation, Kepler-1520 had the 2MASS catalogue number 2MASS J19235189+5130170. In the Kepler Input Catalog it has the designation of KIC 12557548, and when it was found to have transiting planet candidates it was given the Kepler object of interest number of KOI-3794. The star's planetary companion were discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits move in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. The name Kepler-1520 derives directly from the fact that the star is the catalogued 1,520th star discovered by Kepler to have confirmed planets. The designation b, derive from the order of discovery. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star, followed by the other lowercase letters of the alphabet. In the case of Kepler-1520, there was only one planet detected, so only the letter b is used. Stellar characteristics Kepler-1520 is a K-type star that is approximately 76% the mass of and 71% the radius of the Sun. It has a surface temperature of 4677 K and is about 4.47 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 15. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Planetary system The planetary system of KIC 12557548 consists of one extrasolar planet, named Kepler-1520 b. This planet may possess a tail of dust and gas formed in a similar fashion to that of a comet but, as opposed to the tail of a comet, containing molecules of pyroxene and aluminium(III) oxide. Based on the rate at which the particles in the tail are emitted, the mass of the planet has been constrained to less than 0.02 Earth masses ‚Äî a higher-mass planet would have too much gravity to sustain the observed rate of mass loss. Simulations show that the density of dust falls off rapidly with increasing distance from the planet. Calculations conducted by Rappaport et al. show that the dust tail, in addition to absorbing light directly, may scatter some of the light which reaches it, contributing to a small apparent rise in stellar flux before the planet and its tail pass in front of the star, and a small apparent reduction in the stellar flux as the planet exits the plane of the stellar disk.

In the United States, Christian adult contemporary radio stations cater to a mostly adult audience and are similar to mainstream adult contemporary stations in that they play hits often and for long periods of time. Demographics The target audience of Christian adult contemporary radio, generally females in their thirties or forties, has been nicknamed \\"Becky\\" by the Christian music industry. However, artists that are played on Christian adult contemporary radio are predominantly male. Male Christian artists outnumber female Christian artists by at least a 2:1 ratio and, according to Billboard, 43 of the top 50 Christian songs of the 2000s were performed by males. Females held the top spot on the Christian Songs chart for just 11 weeks out of the chart's 337 weeks of activity during the 2000s. Audience testing has revealed that men test well to audiences, while women test low to audiences. This discrepancy has been associated with an overall shift in 2003 from a mainly pop sound to a more rock-oriented sound. As the genre shifted towards more rock-driven songs, deeper male voices from artists such as Third Day, Jeremy Camp, and Todd Agnew became popular, and established female artists like Amy Grant or bands with females like Point of Grace and Avalon, who tested extremely well among audiences, went out of style, along with their pop-oriented sound. Another reason for this discrepancy is audience concern of sexuality among female artists, especially worship leaders, and possible jealousy towards female artists among the format's generally female listener base. Opinion is split on whether or not this represents a permanent shift or just a temporary trend.

They usually come with hoods and matching trousers worn as over garments to prevent cold air, and in some cases water, passing through. Examples A garment with a similar appearance and colours to the Denison Smock, in lighter-weight denim, the 1942 Pattern Smock, Windproof, was also commonly issued to scouts and snipers in infantry battalions, from 1943, but most notably the SAS/SBS/SOE and Commando squads. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the \\"SAS Windproof\\". It was not designed much for parachuting, and lacked a crotch flap, having a drawstring hem instead. The most distinctive point of difference between 'Windproofs' and the Denison smock are that the former are hooded. A matching set of over- trousers was produced to complement the smock. Both items were screen printed with colour-fast pigments in a bold splinter design, with colours similar to that of the Denison. Variations of the 'Windproof' have been the basic Special Forces smock until the present, with several alternative colours seen over the years - white (or at least natural cotton) for LRDG's desert use; olive green; black; and, in now very rare later issues of the Smock, Windproof, 1963 Pattern, the Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) introduced in the late 1960s. The current issue Windproof Smock is in the latest MTP camouflage design. The camouflage pattern of the \\"SAS Windproof\\" was used as the basis of the post World War II Belgian Paratrooper Smock with very similar overtrousers. DPM Windproof Smock Soldier of the 2nd Battalion Yorkshire Regiment wearing Smock Windproof DPM and trousers, temperate pattern. The Smock, Windproof, DPM' (or, DPM Windproof Smock) was issued alongside the standard DPM Combat Jackets by the British Army. The Special Air Service Regiment was the first unit to adopt its own design of DPM Windproof Smock which it wore in preference to the 68 Pattern and later combat jackets. Aside from being made from a windproof material, it differed from the standard combat jackets in being cut to fit more loosely, allowing it to fit over other layers of clothing more easily, and in having an integral hood. Where the standard jackets were closed by a full-length zipper, covered by a buttoned flap, and buttoned cuffs, the windproof smock used velcro to close the flap over the zipper and to fasten the cuffs. The buttons fitted to the Windproof Smock (on the four, expanding front pockets, and the small arm pocket for the First Field Dressing) were all of an overlarge type, to ease use by cold or gloved fingers. Later, a similar DPM Windproof smock was introduced (the Smock, Windproof, Arctic), this was primarily issued to Royal Marine Commandos and Army units assigned to the AMF(L) for arctic warfare. This differed from the Smock, Windproof, DPM in that it had button-on rank tabs on the chest and back, as well as a wire 'stiffener' for the hood. The general issue Combat Soldier 95 combat jacket followed this pattern, but omitting the rank tab on the back which tended to snag on rucksacks, camouflage netting and so forth.

Throughout the museum are hand-painted murals, Jukeboxes and rotating exhibits. There are rooms for parties, events, field-trips and STEAM educational programs as well. History The visible pinball machine, co-created by museum owner Michael Schiess based on the pinball machine Surf Champ by Gottlieb from 1976 The museum was founded in 2004 by Michael Schiess, a former museum exhibition designer. Schiess started collecting pinball machines in 2001. He decided to open his own museum after being unimpressed with the coverage of pinball history at other museums.SF Bay Area's Pacific Pinball Museum, 19 July 2011 by David Pescovitz, BoingBoing One of his first major acquisitions was thirty-six machines in one purchase. Fourteen of them were installed in a rented room, which Schiess called Lucky Ju Ju, in Alameda and a jar was placed out for donations. In 2004 the facility expanded and became a nonprofit, renaming itself the Pacific Pinball Museum. The museum expanded in 2009 displaying forty woodrail and wedge head machines from the collection of Larry Zartarian. The museum has a gift shop that sells pinball themed merchandise. It also has a museum board, and two additional staff members besides Schiess. Collection The museum's exhibitions include approximately ninety pinball machines ranging from 1879 until today. They are arranged in chronological order. In total, Schiess' collection comprises 800 machines. Those not on display are maintained at an 8,000-square-foot secret location. Upon paying the admission fee, visitors can play any of the machines on display. The oldest machine, from 1879, is a Montague Redgrave Parlor Bagatelle. Contemporary machines include The Addams Family and the Twilight Zone. The museum also has a transparent pinball machine from 1976 that was built by Schiess and Wade Krause. It is based on the Gottlieb \\"Surf Champ\\" game.http://pacificpinball.org/pinball-machines/surf-champ-visible-pin One of the most valued pieces in the collection is a 1930s-era Art Deco machine called the Bally Bumper. The machine was seized by police in Oakland during Prohibition. The museum's collection has also been displayed at San Francisco International Airport.

They may be used to teach academic lessons or help students learn social skills. By setting=Elementary schools Entering a classroom, whether one full of preschoolers or school age children, one has no doubt that educational toys are part of the modern educator's curriculum. From manipulative, to dress up, to board games, to musical instruments, to interactive electronic toys such as robots or turtle roamers, the breadth of educational toys is vast. While it is not uncommon to find computers in the modern elementary school classroom, it is not yet common to find children actively engaged in video games for educational development. However, as computers and video games take an ever-larger role in our lives and the lives of children, so too will their role in educational toys and games. This underscores a crucial point about the fluidity of the definition of an educational toy. As the perception of what is \\"educational\\" changes, so too will the integration of new toys into our children's classrooms. Plato, the Greek philosopher, says in Laws: :\\"I'm going to explain how one should describe education: It is this I insist that man who intends to be good at a particular occupation must practice it from childhood both at work and at play he must be surrounded by the 'special tools of the trade.' :We should learn to use the children's games to channel their pleasures and desires towards activities in which they have to engage when they are adult...\\" Universities Some college professors have adopted the practice of edutainment in order to keep the interest of adult students in long classroom lectures. Here the instructor entertains the students while meeting course objectives. An important teaching technique of education is to use variety, by utilizing various mediums such as video, in-class skits, demonstrations, and Power Point slides along with lectures.

He was a member of a.k.a. Cartoon, the production team for Cartoon Network's longest running television series, Ed, Edd n' Eddy, as a title sequence animator and director. He was responsible for creating the opening sequence of the series. He began his career working for International Rocketship on two Gary Larson specials. During his career he taught at Vancouver Film School and worked at many animation studios in Vancouver. His work directing for Aaagh! It's the Mr. Hell Show!, along with co-director Moose Pagen, was nominated for an Annie Award\\"29th Annie Awards\\" in 2001. He was shot and killed on August 13, 2007, by a police officer, Lee Chipperfield, in Vancouver. A video recorded by tourists showed Boyd being shot nine times after wielding a bicycle chain at officers who came to respond to a disturbance involving him. The ninth shot that struck Boyd was fired as he was on the ground. The officer who shot Boyd was cleared in the death. The use of force was criticized by many of Boyd's colleagues and relatives. Early history Boyd was born September 30, 1967 in Pasadena, California. He grew up in the west side of Vancouver, British Columbia and attended Lord Byng Secondary School. He attended University of British Columbia and Concordia University in Montreal. Before joining a.k.a. Cartoon, during his youth, he showed an unusual gift for expression in the visual arts. For the last 15 years of his life he had a successful career as an animator, employed by a number of different animation studios in Vancouver. He was passionate about his work and it was highly regarded. Career According to the animation industry website Cartoon Brew, other than Ed, Edd n Eddy, Paul Boyd also worked for The Mr. Hell Show and provided animation for Gary Larson's Tales from the Far Side and the first Flash animation television series ¬°Mucha Lucha! An incomplete list of his animation credits can be found on IMDb.Animation list at iMDB During the 1990s he taught many young animators at the Vancouver Film School. A prize in his honour for the top student in Classical Animation at the Vancouver Film School is funded by his family and presented three times per year. At the time of Paul's death he was working at the Global Mechanic studio. His last completed work was on two animated advertisements for the Alberta Government.\\"Born To Move\\"\\"Born To Eat\\" Illness and death While in his 20s, Boyd was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (manic depression), an illness for which he received constant and usually effective treatment. He lived with this illness for almost 20 years. Investigation The murder was investigated by the Vancouver Police Department and their findings passed on to the Criminal Justice Branch of BC which decided not to prosecute Chipperfield.\\"Criminal Justice Branch media release March 2010\\" After a Coroner's Inquest\\"Official Findings Coroner's Inquest Dec 2010\\" in December 2010 revealed many details which did not figure in the Criminal Justice Branch report, a complaint was filed by the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association to the Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner alleging that excessive force had been used. In March 2012, the British Columbia Police Complaint Commissioner issued a report concluding that there was not \\"clear, convincing and cogent evidence ... that Chipperfield used unnecessary force or excessive force during this incident.\\" He based his conclusion partly on an opinion provided by a use-of-force expert, Bill Lewinski, who suggested that Chipperfield could have been suffering from \\"inattentional blindness.\\"\\"Police Complaint Commissioner's report March 2012\\" In May 2012, a video captured by a tourist's video camera surfaced. In the video, which starts just as a burst of two shots was fired (the 7th and 8th shots), Boyd is seen crawling on the road, unarmed. In the time between the eighth and ninth (fatal) shot, an officer is seen standing near Boyd handling an object that analysis of the video showed to be a chain and throwing it to one side thus providing evidence that Boyd was unarmed at the time the fatal shot was fired. David Eby, executive director of the B. C. Civil Liberties Association, said that the video made it clear that Boyd did not pose a threat to anyone at the time the fatal bullet was fired. In light of the new evidence, an independent investigative agency, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), was asked by the Attorney General of British Columbia to review the case with the new video in consideration. In a June 25, 2013 media statement, the Criminal Justice Branch announced that ASIRT had completed its investigation and on June 24, 2013, the Assistant Deputy Attorney General, M. Joyce DeWitt-Van Oosten, had appointed a prominent Vancouver lawyer, Mark Jett√©, as special prosecutor to decide on the basis of ASIRT's report and further investigation, if necessary, if charges would be laid against any of the officers involved in the incident. If a decision were made to prosecute then Mr. Jett√© would conduct the prosecution. Ms DeWitt-Van Oosten concluded that it was necessary to appoint a Special Prosecutor to avoid any potential for real or perceived improper influence in the administration of criminal justice in reviewing the ASIRT report. \\"Media Statement re Special Prosecutor appointment\\" The BCCLA applauded the B.C. government for their June 2013 decision to appoint a Special Prosecutor to reconsider laying charges in the Boyd case. \\"Response from the BCCLA\\" (In December 2010, following the conclusion of the Coroner's Inquest, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association had called for a Special Prosecutor to be appointed but this request was rejected at that time). On October 28, 2013, the Criminal Justice Branch announced that the special prosecutor had decided that no charges would be laid against Chipperfield in this case. Because the intent of Chipperfield's actions, i.e. to shoot and kill Boyd, was not in dispute the only charge that would have been appropriate was one of second degree murder. However, the prosecutor reasoned that the defense of self- defense would likely succeed because of the requirement that the prosecution establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Chipperfield knew he was shooting an unarmed and severely wounded man who did not pose a threat of death or serious injury to Chipperfield or others.\\"Criminal Justice Branch media statement, October 28, 2013\\" Some of the police officers and civilian witnesses present at the time of the fatal shot testified that Boyd was crawling at the time he was killed and did not present a threat to any other person. Others testified that although he was crawling he did present a threat, and still others said that he was walking and upright up until the final shot. There was similar differing testimony regarding whether or not he was armed. While the video may support some of these testimonies more than others, as a whole they could be used by the defence to attempt to establish that a reasonable person could believe that Boyd posed a threat at the time of his death.

It was produced and directed by James Motluk (credited as James E Motluk)https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0609386/ and broadcast on OMNI TV.http://www.omnitv.ca/ontario/info/press/p_20090604.shtml  Subject matter  The movie begins with the discovery by filmmaker Motluk of a parole certificate issued to his late grandfather, Elias, in 1918. Trying to uncover the truth about why the certificate was issued, he begins a journey that is chronicled in the film, first to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and then to Ottawa. What he discovers is that the Canadian government created legislation known as The War Measures Act to arrest and intern thousands of Ukrainians whom they perceived as enemy aliens during the war. After the war, these prisoners were paroled and made to work as forced labour in many private Canadian companies on the railroad, in the mines and even building the national park system.http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/bc/revelstoke/natcul/hist/intern.aspx Motluk traces his own grandfather to a camp located in the northern Ontario town of Kapuskasing. Until recently, the Canadian government tried to hide what had happened. During the production of the film, the government finally apologized to the Ukrainian community and agreed to pay restitution. The title refers to Motluk's grandfather whom he would call Jajo, a child's version of Tato which is Ukrainian for father. Critical reception The film has received a lot of praise since its debut on OMNI TV in June 2009. In 2011 it was invited to screen at Columbia Universityhttp://www.columbia.edu/cu/ufc/films/library_jajo.html in New York and later at the Ukrainian Museum in Manhattan.

Design and development RV-1 Picture of an SA-3A Playboy shows the original struts and canopy arrangement The first RV-1 was a Stits SA-3A completed on 3 October 1965. The Playboy is a single-place, strut-braced, low-wing aircraft with conventional landing gear. The aircraft engine was upgraded from the normally- fitted powerplant to a Lycoming O-290G. The resulting aircraft had good performance, but a high landing speed. On 16 August 1965, the aircraft was registered as an RV-1. Modifications included a new aluminum wing with flaps, Horner wing tips, and a bubble canopy. The fuselage uses welded steel tube construction in contrast to the RV series that followed which uses all- aluminum fuselage construction. The flaps reduced the stall speed to . A second series of modifications included a streamlined cowling, wheel pants and modified horizontal tail surfaces. Operational history The organization Friends of the RV-1 was formed to restore the prototype RV-1. It was flown across the United States and Canada in 2012 to various airshows and events. On 23 July 2012, the prototype RV-1 will be showcased at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, prior to donation to the EAA AirVenture Museum.

Health-related articles on Wikipedia are popularly accessed as results from search engines, which frequently deliver links to Wikipedia articles. Independent assessments have been made of the number and demographics of people who seek health information on Wikipedia, the scope of health information on Wikipedia, and the quality of the information on Wikipedia. The English-language Wikipedia was estimated in 2014 to hold around 25,000 articles on health-related topics. Across Wikipedia encyclopedias in all languages there were 155,000 health articles using 950,000 citations to sources and which collectively received 4.8 billion pageviews in 2013. This amount of traffic makes Wikipedia one of the most consulted health resources in the world, or perhaps the most consulted resource. Amount of health content As of the end of 2013, the English Wikipedia had 29,072 medical articles, while across all language versions of Wikipedia, there were 155,805 medical articles. As of March 2017, the English Wikipedia had 30,000 medical articles, while there were 164,000 medical articles in other languages. As of 2017, there were about 6,000 anatomy articles on the English Wikipedia; these are not classified as \\"medical articles\\" in Wikipedia's categorization scheme and thus are not included in the 30,000 figure above. Academic studies=Accuracy and usefulness A 2007 study examined a sample of Wikipedia pages about the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States, and found that 85.7% of them were appropriate for patients and that these articles had \\"a remarkably high level of internal validity\\". However, the same study also raised concerns about Wikipedia's completeness, noting that only 62.9% of the articles examined were free of \\"critical omissions\\". A 2008 study reported that drug information on Wikipedia \\"has a more narrow scope, is less complete, and has more errors of omission\\" than did such information on the traditionally edited online database Medscape Drug Reference. A 2010 study found that Wikipedia's article on osteosarcoma was of decent quality, but that the National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s page was better. The authors concluded that Wikipedia should include external links to higher-quality sources. A 2011 assessment of 50 medical articles on Wikipedia found that 56% of the references cited on these pages could be considered reputable, and that each entry contained 29 reputable sources on average. A 2011 study examined Wikipedia pages about five statins, and concluded that these pages did not contain incorrect or misleading information, but that they were often missing information about drug interactions and contraindications to use. Another 2011 study examining Wikipedia articles on the 20 most widely prescribed drugs found that seven of these articles did not have any references, and concluded that \\"Wikipedia does not provide consistently accurate, complete, and referenced medication information.\\" An assessment of Wikipedia articles in 2012 on dietary supplements found that Wikipedia articles were \\"frequently incomplete, of variable quality, and sometimes inconsistent with reputable sources of information on these products.\\" A 2013 scoping review published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research summarized the existing evidence about the use of wikis, Wikipedia and other collaborative writing applications in health care and found that the available research publications were observational reports rather than the primary research studies which would be necessary to begin drawing conclusions. A 2014 study that examined 97 Wikipedia articles about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) found that 4% of them had attained \\"Good article\\" status, and that CAM articles on Wikipedia tended to be significantly shorter than those about conventional therapies. In May 2014, The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association published an article which concluded that \\"Most Wikipedia articles for the 10 costliest conditions in the United States contain errors compared with standard peer-reviewed sources.\\" Following this paper, many other media sources reported that readers should not trust Wikipedia for medical information. Wikipedia's contributors to its health content defended Wikipedia and criticized this study, as the research is considered severely flawed including basic methodological flaws like the conclusions are not supported by the data provided.Pippa Stephens ‚Äì Health reporter ‚Äì BBC News ‚Äì 28 May 2014 Trust your doctor, not Wikipedia, say scientists (Accessed on 14 March 2017) A 2014 study found that when the FDA issues new safety warnings about drugs, in 41% of cases reviewed Wikipedia articles about those drugs were updated to give the new safety information within two weeks. Another 23% of Wikipedia drug articles were updated to give this information within an average of about 40 days, but 36% of articles are not updated with this information within a year. A 2014 comparison between selected drug information from pharmacology textbooks and comparable information on the English-language and German-language Wikipedias found that the drug information in Wikipedia covers most of what is essential for undergraduate pharmacology studies and that it is accurate. A 2015 study comparing the coverage of the autism-vaccine controversy on several websites found that Wikipedia's articles were broadly pro-vaccine. The study attributed this pro-vaccine stance to \\"this highly controversial topic attracting committed editors who strictly enforce the requirements for academic references.\\" A 2016 study found that drug information on Wikipedia was less accurate and complete than that on the medical reference site Micromedex. A 2017 study compared the accuracy of Wikipedia articles about the 33 most popular medications with medication guides to the accuracy of their medication guides. The study found that the Wikipedia articles were generally less accurate than were the corresponding medication guides. Readability In 2012, Wikipedia's articles on depression and schizophrenia were compared to coverage in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and a psychiatry textbook and evaluated for their accuracy, up-to-dateness, breadth of coverage, referencing, and readability. Wikipedia was ranked highly across all categories except for readability. A 2013 review of nephrology content on Wikipedia found it to be \\"a comprehensive and fairly reliable medical resource for nephrology patients that is written at a college reading level\\". A 2014 study found that Wikipedia's article on Parkinson's disease had a Flesch reading ease score of 30.31, meaning that it was difficult to read. The readability of Wikipedia's articles on epilepsy was evaluated and found to be low, indicating that they were difficult to read. Another study found that Wikipedia's information about neurological diseases was significantly more difficult to read than the information in the American Academy of Neurology's patient brochures, the Mayo Clinic's website, or MedlinePlus. Another 2015 study, this one authored by Samy Azer, reported that Wikipedia should not be used to learn about concepts related to pulmonology students. Another 2015 study by Azer found that Wikipedia entries about cardiovascular diseases were \\"not aimed at a medical audience\\" and were mainly inaccurate due to errors of omission. A 2016 study found that Wikipedia information about common internal medicine diagnoses was written at a higher grade level than any of the four other sites studied (NIH, WebMD, Mayo Clinic, and \\"diagnosis-specific websites\\"). In contrast, another study published the same year found that medical students reading about three unstudied diseases on AccessMedicine and Wikipedia experienced less mental effort than did readers of the same diseases on UpToDate. A 2017 study evaluating 134 Wikipedia articles on autoimmune diseases found that they were very difficult to read and required at least a university graduate reading level. The study's authors were concerned by Wikipedia's low readability, as people with autoimmune disorders often use Wikipedia to research their condition. A 2018 study evaluating 55 Wikipedia articles on neurosurgical topics found that they were significantly more difficult to read than the American Association of Neurological Surgeons's patient information articles, although both Wikipedia's articles and the AANS articles required a college reading level. Other views Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has said that lack of health information increases preventable deaths in emerging markets and that health information from Wikipedia can improve community health. Wales presented the Wikipedia Zero project as a channel for delivering health information into places where people have difficulty accessing online information. As a result of public interest in the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, Wikipedia became a popular source of information on Ebola. Doctors who were Wikipedia contributors said that Wikipedia's quality made it useful. Alternative medicine People who promote alternative medicine have complained that Wikipedia negatively portrays holistic health treatments including energy medicine, Emotional Freedom Techniques, Thought Field Therapy and Tapas Acupressure Technique. In response, Wales has stated, \\"If you can get your work published in respectable scientific journals ‚Äì that is to say, if you can produce evidence through replicable scientific experiments, then Wikipedia will cover it appropriately.\\"Hay Newman, Lily (27 March 2014) Jimmy Wales Gets Real, and Sassy, About Wikipedia's Holistic Healing Coverage, Slate (magazine) Retrieved 23 November 2014ACEP's Position Statement on Wikipedia energypsych.org Retrieved 23 November 2014 Similar concerns have been raised regarding its coverage of homeopathy. Wikipedia policy for articles that \\"could reasonably be perceived as relating to human health\\" comes under the policy for medicine-related articles which is science-based. Usage The majority of people in the United States use the internet as a source of health information. The third most common activity for information seeking online is looking up health or medical information. One 2013 study suggested that 22% of healthcare searches online direct users to Wikipedia. Wikipedia was described in 2014 in a report published by IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics as \\"the leading single source\\" of healthcare information for patients and healthcare professionals.Note ‚Äì sketchy link requires registration. Further cited in  * According to the same report, 50% of U.S. physicians that go online for professional purposes are using Wikipedia to access information. These facts were referenced on page 17 from the same research report published by IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics on \\"Engaging Patients Through Social Media,\\" and were recirculated further in popular media outlets and peer-reviewed articles. The IMS report provides a citation to an undated research report in \\"Taking the Pulse\\" by Manhattan Research, which is unavailable using most library research databases In July 2014, Wikipedia's medical content in all languages was viewed more often than any other popular healthcare website, including the NIH, WebMD, Mayo Clinic, NHS, WHO, and UpToDate. Some doctors have described their use of Wikipedia as a \\"guilty secret\\". General public A 2015 study compared the popularity of Wikipedia's articles on ten of the most common neurological disorders over a 90-day period from April 2014 to July 2014; it found that there was no relationship between the incidence or prevalence of a neurological disorder and the number of page views it received. For example, Wikipedia's article on multiple sclerosis was far more popular than its articles on more common disorders like migraine, epilepsy, or stroke. The authors theorized that this might be due to the increasing prevalence of MRI scans, which has led to an increase in incidental findings of white matter lesions. Although most of these lesions have nothing to do with multiple sclerosis, they may lead patients, relatives, and even physicians to perform Internet searches on \\"multiple sclerosis\\", which may lead them to the Wikipedia article. Medical students Wikipedia's health information has been described as \\"transforming how our next doctors learn medicine\\". Various commentators in health education have said that Wikipedia is popular and convenient for medical students. A 2013 study done at a single Australian medical school showed that 97% of students used Wikipedia to study medicine, with the most common reasons being ease of access and ease of understanding. There was no relationship between a student's year in medical school and his or her use of Wikipedia, but students further along in medical school were less likely to use Wikipedia as their first resource, only resource, or most common resource; they were also more likely to perceive Wikipedia as unreliable. In 2013, UCSF School of Medicine began to offer fourth-year medical students a month-long elective centered around improving Wikipedia's health-related articles. Between 2013 and 2015, 43 students took part in the course and chose a single health-related article to work on. A study of their contributions by UCSF faculty found that the students expanded their articles, added higher-quality sources, removed lower- quality sources, and improved readability. The study's authors argued that medical schools should encourage students to contribute to Wikipedia, both to improve the quality of its content and to enable students to become better health care educators. A 2013 study of a particular group of veterinary students found that the majority of these students sought and found medical information on Wikipedia. A 2015 study of five European medical schools found that students who used Wikipedia for general information were more likely to use it to look up medical information. 16% of students used Wikipedia often for general information, 60% sometimes, and 24% rarely. 12% of students used Wikipedia often for medical information, 55% sometimes, and 33% rarely. Almost all of the students (97%) found inaccurate information on Wikipedia at least once, but less than 20% of them corrected it. A 2015 study of medical students at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, found that they ranked Google and Wikipedia highly for their accessibility, understandability, and usefulness but ranked PubMed higher for accuracy and trustworthiness. A 2017 study of online resource use by first-year medical students at Melbourne Medical School found that they used the school's online learning platform most often (daily) and used Google and Wikipedia slightly less often (approximately daily). The students considered the learning platform to be most useful, followed by Google and Wikipedia, which they considered slightly less useful than the learning platform but significantly more useful than Facebook or Google Scholar. They also considered the learning platform to be the most reliable and considered Google and Wikipedia to be significantly less reliable, although they frequently used both websites as a starting point for finding information. A 2017 study of resources used by medical students during their general surgery clerkship at the University of Florida College of Medicine found that review books were the most commonly used type of study resource, followed by the Internet. Wikipedia was the third-most commonly used resource and the most commonly used Internet resource. The study found no correlation between the type of resource used and students' performance on the NBME surgery subject exam. Residents A 2009 study of Internet use by 35 junior doctors in the United Kingdom found that 80% of them used Google and 70% of them used Wikipedia to look up medical information at least once a week, while only 30% used PubMed. Google and Wikipedia were primarily used for background reading, while PubMed and other \\"best evidence\\" websites were used to answer specific questions for clinical decision-making. A 2015 survey of psychiatry residents at Harvard Medical School found that they used online resources twice as often as they used printed resources. The three most commonly used resources were UpToDate, PubMed, and Wikipedia. UpToDate was the most used resource and was considered to be the most trustworthy, while PubMed was the second most used resource and was highly rated as a source of personal learning. Wikipedia was the third most used resource and received the highest ranking for ease of use; however, it was considered the least trustworthy.  Physicians and other health professionals  A 2013 study of 500 European physicians, most of whom were from Austria and Switzerland, found that general search engines like Google were the most popular type of online medical resource, followed by medical research databases like PubMed, followed in third by Wikipedia. 56% of physicians in training (residents) reported using Wikipedia, versus only 37% of physicians who had already completed their training. A 2014 study of 259 health professionals in Spain found that while 53% of them used the Spanish Wikipedia to look up medical information during work, only 3% of them considered it reliable and only 16% recommended it to their patients. Only 16% had ever edited a Wikipedia article; the most common reasons for not doing were that they did not consider themselves an expert (51%), they preferred to blog or publish peer-reviewed articles (21%), and they were concerned that someone would undo any contributions they made (17%). Academic citations Wikipedia has been inappropriately cited as an authoritative source in many health science journals. Impact on psychological tests In 2009 a doctor and Wikipedia editor, James Heilman, incorporated public domain images of the Rorschach test into Wikipedia.  Psychologists complained that the increased public exposure to these tests devalued their clinical utility, and that public health was harmed as a result. Nature of contributors A 2014 interview study found that around half of the editors of health-related content on the English-language Wikipedia are health care professionals, while the other half includes some medical students. An author of this study wrote that this provides \\"reassurance about the reliability of the website\\". The study also found that the \\"core editor community\\", who actively monitor and edit most health-related articles on the English-language Wikipedia, numbered around 300 people. The study found that people who contribute on these topics do so for a variety of reasons, including a desire to better learn the subjects themselves, and a sense of both responsibility and enjoyment in improving others' access to health information. A 2016 study found that Wikipedia editors who contributed to articles on designer drugs were most likely to also contribute to articles on illegal drugs and pharmaceutical drugs, implying that they have a background in pharmacology. They were also more likely to contribute to articles on neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, other diseases, and cell biology; they were least likely to edit articles about popular culture topics or history. Traffic statistics in health monitoring Just as Google Flu Trends was able to correlate searches for flu to local outbreaks of flu, page views of Wikipedia articles on flu-related topics have been found to increase in populations experiencing the spread of flu, and of other diseases such as dengue fever and tuberculosis. Projects to improve health information on Wikipedia In 2009 the National Institutes of Health attempted a pilot project for integrating health information into Wikipedia.In 2011, it was reported that Cancer Research UK had started a program whereby some of its staff would edit Wikipedia's cancer-related articles. The University of California, San Francisco has a program for encouraging students to contribute health content to Wikipedia. A collaboration between Cochrane and Wikipedia provides access to the Cochrane Library for the purposes of incorporating their review information into Wikipedia articles.

Dopo was founded in 2003 and Adesso was spun off in February 2009 when the owners acquired additional nearby space. Both restaurants focus on charcuterie, with menus changing on a daily basis to take advantage of timely ingredients. They have been described by the New York Times as part of a new wave of innovative restaurants that have begun to improve Oakland's reputation for food, and have won extensive local acclaim, with both Dopo and Adesso being listed by the San Francisco Chronicle as one of the top hundred restaurants in the Bay Area in 2012. Dopo Dopo was the first of Smulewitz's restaurants, founded in September 2003. It serves Northern Italian inspired cuisine, focusing primarily on charcuterie, pizza, and seafood and emphasizing dishes that are less well known. Its style has been influenced by the California cuisine of the nearby Chez Panisse, as well as the charcuterie of Oliveto, a nearby restaurant that was one of the first in the country to have an in-house charcuterie program. The restaurant makes an active effort to use local and sustainable food where possible, with ingredients being purchased fresh from Monterey Market every day, or delivered by local farms. Dopo has been rated among the top hundred restaurants in the Bay Area by the San Francisco Chronicle from 2007 to 2011. Adesso The interior of Adesso Adesso was split off from Dopo in early 2009.

He was the first Engineer-in-Chief of the United States Navy. Early life Charles Haynes Haswell was born May 22, 1809, on North Moore Street, New York City, the son of a Dublin-born member of the British foreign service, Charles Haswell, and his wife Dorothea Haynes of a Barbados planter family, her brother Gen.

Although at first his role was only quasi-unofficial, there being no rank structure for engineers in the Navy at the time, when he was finally officially nominated and confirmed in 1851 to the rank of chief engineer, the appointment was to date from the start of his service in July 1836.Journal of Executive Proceedings of the United States, Washington: Government Printing Office, 1887, vol. 8, pp. 274, 288. Thus began a Naval career during which he would supervise the design of engines for ten warships.Burr William McIntosh, \\"People of Note\\", Burr MacIntosh Monthly, August 1907, vol. 14 (no. 53) In 1839, he served on a naval board responsible for the construction of the steam frigates Missouri and Mississippi, for which he was relieved of his duties to the Fulton. After work on the Michigan, he became chief engineer on the Missouri, but a dispute over a plan to replace its one smokestack with two earned him a two-year suspension, during which time he was involved in the construction of the boilers for the Allegheny and several revenue cutters.\\"New York has Oldest Practicing Engineer\\", The New York Times, 13 May 1906 He was also instrumental in the Navy's creation of a corps of engineers, and he was named the first engineer-in-chief in October 1844. He subsequently designed the engines of Powhatan and San Jacinto. A public dispute over the design of the latter led to his removal as Engineer-in-Chief, and he was instead made chief engineer of the San Jacinto, having had responsibility for the design of its propulsion system, advocating his preferred propeller over a sidewheel, but being overruled.George W. Baird, \\"Charles H. Haswell, M.E.\\", Marine Engineering, vol. 5 (1900), p. 538-540 One of his innovations while with the navy was the use of zinc lining to the boilers to reduce corrosion. Roanoke Island under Union attack, with the gunboats before Fort Bartow at the bend of the channel in Croatan Sound As chief engineer, he is credited with establishing the qualifications for the engineering corps of the Navy. However, by 1850, his health declined and he was declared unfit for duty, yet word failed to reach the Navy and he was ordered to sea with San Jacinto.Desmond FitzGerald, Clemens Herschel and Ira N. Hollis, \\"Obituary: Charles Haynes Haswell\\", Journal of the Association of Engineering Societies, vol. 39, pp. 277-281. His ill health continued, and he left the ship in mid-cruise, going ashore in Spain to recover, and then to New York. Still unaware of his true medical state, the Navy considered him to have abandoned his post and removed him from the service in May 1852. He would briefly return to naval service during the American Civil War, when he served as chief engineer for the Burnside Expedition, and there briefly commanded a small steamer that pulled off the shoaled gunboat Ranger from under the guns of Fort Bartow during the shelling of Roanoke Island. Private sector Charles Haynes Haswell in the late 1850s as representative to the New York Common Council Following his separation from the Navy in the early 1850s, Haswell returned to New York, where he started work in the private sector, designing numerous commercial ships. He served as a consulting engineer for the Board of Health, the Quarantine Commission, the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, and for the Board of Public Improvements,Thomas William Herringshaw, Herringshaw‚Äôs National Library of American Biography, Chicago: American Publishers‚Äô Association, 1914, vol. 3, p. 92 being much sought on questions of the suitability of the uncertain geological structure underlying New York City for establishing firm foundations for the city's growing skyscrapers. Following the city's purchase of Rikers Island, he directed improvements including grading and trimming of the island,\\"Charles H. Haswell Dead\\", The New York Times, 13 May 1907 personally supervising the work when in his nineties, and also made improvements to Hart Island and Hoffman Island. He applied his marine engineering experience as Surveyor of Steamships for Marine Underwriters of New York, a roll he occupied for four decades, performing similar work for Boston and Philadelphia firms, and for Lloyd's. He was sent a $1500 diamond ring by the Emperor of Russia for supplying drafts of his design of the engines of the Powhatan.Nelson P. Lewis, \\"Charles Haynes Haswell\\", The Railroad Magazine, vol. 42 (1907), no. 20, p. 686Charleston Courier, October 9, 1854, p. 1 He was also a yachting enthusiast, serving as Chairman of the regatta committee and chief measurer for the New York Yacht Club.Kenneth T.

In religion, he was a regularly attending member of the Dutch Reformed Church. Politics Tammany Hall in convention regalia, 1868 From the time of his return to New York following his Naval service, Haswell also became active in politics. In 1855 he was elected to the New York City Common Council, representing the city's 21st Ward, and in his final year, 1859, he served as president of the council. He served as chairman of a politically stacked grand jury impaneled to investigate voter fraud in the election of 1868. Like most of the members of this body, he was deeply associated with the Tammany Hall political machine,John I.

It was known as Pink Godzilla Games until 2009. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer considers it \\"Seattle's best\\" among such retailers. History The store was founded as Pink Godzilla Games in 2005 and was known by that name for many years. Toho, owner of the Godzilla franchise, claimed the store was infringing upon its trademark. Pink Godzilla announced in 2009 that it would change its name. Rather than engage in a legal fight, the store decided to voluntarily rebrand. The company's mascot is Pink Gojima, from the fictional Island of Go. It is also known as Pinky G or just Pinky. The mascot uses the colors of pink and green, which are also used to decorate the retail locations. In 2018, Pink Gorilla was featured on IGN as one of the Top 5 Essential Spots to Visit In Seattle for Nerds. Products Pink Gorilla buys and sells video games. Offerings include classic games for numerous video game consoles, ranging from early home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Famicom through to modern consoles, namely the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. They also import games and accessories from Japan. The store offers a number of other non-game gaming products, including imported Japanese plush toys, key chains, magazines, strategy guides, accessories, trading cards, and small toys from gashapon machines at both locations. The store also offers merchandise such as toys and Pink Gorilla-branded T-shirts, hats, beanies, and stuffed pink gorillas fashioned after the store mascot Pinky G. As a sales promotion, the store gives customers who walk in wearing store-branded T-shirts a discount on purchases. Locations People browsing a Pink Gorilla retailer. Pink Gorilla operates two retail locations.http://www.pinkgorillagames.com/locations The original Pink Gorilla retailer is located in the Chinatown-International District of Seattle, Washington. It is located near to Uwajimaya. The company opened its second location in the University of Washington University District on October 13, 2009. Video game players and Twitch.tv viewers from Cody's streams are known to drive from nearby regions, including Canada and Oregon, to visit the store.

Paine noted, \\"[The] Japanese are more happy to have business with Japanese speakers, but not the outsiders who don't speak the language.\\" As of August 1, 2016, Pink Gorilla is now owned by Cody and Kelsey Spencer. Cody and Kelsey both worked for Paine in the store for many years before they were able to afford to purchase the company in full from Paine & Hess. Cody and Kelsey Spencer both work full time in the store. Cody Spencer often live streams himself after normal business hours from inside the store fixing gaming consoles and stocking shelves on the website Twitch.tv under the name DSKoopa. https://www.twitch.tv/DSKoopa Kelsey is Co-Director at Video Game History Foundation based out of Seattle. Events The store represents itself at a number of comic- and gaming-related conventions, including Emerald City Comicon, Sakura-Con, Seattle Retro Gaming Expo, Portland Retro Gaming Expo, and Penny Arcade Expo. The store also hosts its own events, including tournaments, chiptunes shows, and launch events for major video game releases. In 2011, Pink Gorilla held a fundraiser for the Japanese earthquake and tsunami relief efforts and generously donated $1000 to the cause. Starting in 2019 Cody has gone on retro game road trips, visiting every retro game store in Washington and Oregon allowing his Twitch.tv subscribers compile a list of games for him to pick up for them along the way. The first retro game road trip was cut short after Cody purchased a store.

Eclipses there are seen during the lunar sunrise and sunset and extend to the furthermost areas of the near side but mainly not in the polar areas of the Moon. While the Moon orbits Earth, Earth rotates once in nearly 24 hours, but its position at the sky is only in one position, as it never changes. This is in contrast to some other moons or other satellites orbiting other planets or dwarf planets and a few asteroids, even inside the Solar System. They are, however, very rare in the outer part of the solar system. The last solar eclipse on the Moon was a total eclipse on January 20, 2019, with the entire near side and tiny surroundings of the far side seeing totality. Length Unlike the Earth, which sees its eclipse for up to two and a half hours, the longest eclipse that can be viewed in one area on the Moon lasts for up to five and a half hours. Some long eclipses on the Moon, however, usually last for about five hours in one area, with the Earth's shadow touching the Moon for a maximum of six hours. Some eclipses are longer when the Earth is slightly closer to the Moon. During such on eclipses, the Moon is seen on Earth with its apparent diameter larger than the Sun's. Meanwhile, some eclipses are shorter when the Earth is slightly further away from the Moon. On Earth, the Moon is seen with its apparent diameter smaller than the Sun's. Unlike the Earth, where its eclipses start and end at a different place, all of the Moon's solar eclipses begin in the westernmost parts of the near side and end in the easternmost parts of the near side. Solar eclipses starting near and within the polar areas are always partial, while solar eclipses starting at or within the equator are always total. Penumbral shadow In its eclipses, the penumbral shadow does not appear until it is around 25‚Äì30% obscuration. It becomes slightly darker when the Earth blocks the sunlight until it reaches totality in some eclipses. In some eclipses, its penumbral shadow covers the whole surface, whereas the center of the Earth's shadow misses a portion of the Moon while every part of the Nearside sees a partial eclipse. These eclipses are very rare. The last century that not all parts of the near side and the surrounding parts of the far side saw only as partial was the 18th century. On Earth, they are seen as total penumbral eclipses. The Moon passes a narrow path within the penumbra and outside the umbra. It can happen on the Earth's northern or southern penumbral edges. These eclipses can last up to four and a half hours without having any part of the Moon, notably at its poles, reaching totality. Center of the Earth's shadow Unlike the Earth, which receives the smallest portion being inside the center of the Moon's shadow during total solar eclipses, during total eclipses on the Moon, the center of the Earth's shadow covers the whole near side of the Moon and lasts much longer than on Earth, up to 1.8 hours.Lunar eclipses Some total-partial eclipses have at most half or a part of the Moon being in the center of the Earth's shadow. Unlike the Earth, whose umbral shadow appears black, as the Moon has no atmosphere, the surface appears not just black but red and brown, according to the Danjon scale. This is because the only sunlight available is refracted through the Earth's atmosphere on the edges of the Earth, forming an atmospheric ring. Temperatures during long totality The mid-infrared image of the Moon was taken during a September 1996 lunar eclipse by the SPIRIT-III instrument aboard the orbiting Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) satellite. On the Moon, they are seen as solar eclipses. At these wavelengths, MSX was able to characterize the thermal (heat) distribution of the lunar surface during the eclipse. The brightest regions are the warmest, and the darkest areas are the coolest. The well-known crater Tycho is the bright object to the south of the center. Numerous other craters are also seen as bright spots, indicating that their temperature is higher than in the surrounding dark mare. During eclipses with long totality, temperatures plunge on the moon but not in many of its seas. However, in some areas, the temperatures remain high. This especially applies to Oceanus Procellarum and Mare Tranquillitatis and mid to large craters, especially those with basalt floors and mostly in the middle portion of the Moon, some young craters, and a few distant large craters, notably Tycho (located at 43.31¬∞S). Some craters are slightly cooler but as warm as the surface and warmer than areas outside the basins such as Copernicus and Langrenus. Partial eclipses On the Moon, when there is a partial eclipse, a part of the Moon has a partial eclipse, either north or south. One example of this is when half of the Sun is blocked, north or south. In some partial eclipses when the center of the Earth's shadow misses the Moon, one hemisphere can have a partial eclipse while the other does not. In some eclipses, when the center of the Earth's shadow covers a part or most, one part has a total eclipse, and one part has a partial eclipse. Partial and total eclipses together with simply partial last for up to about six hours without having totality in all parts of the near side and a very small part of the far side next to the near side. Standalone partial and total eclipses between partial eclipses can last up to 3.5 hours. At its edges of the near side and its small surroundings At the edges of the near side and a small surrounding part of the hard side where the Earth is mostly half- or partly-seen, in the west, some solar eclipses begin at sunrise, and the Sun is seen after sunrise. In some eclipses, the Sun is partially visible, partially eclipsed in others. In the east, some solar eclipses end at sunset, and the Sun is seen before sunset. In other eclipses, the Sun is partially visible. It also occurs in several polar areas. In that part of the Moon, the Earth is seen in the high- altitude areas of craters, hills, and mountains, as well as a few areas such as lunar seas (also known as plains). In some areas, it is visible in deep craters and most of the surrounding lower-ground areas. In the middle parts, the Earth is never visible, and its eclipses are never seen as the crater and its mountains, including crater ones, block the view. In areas around seven to eight degrees near the far side, a part of the Earth's view is blocked. In some eclipses, this phenomenon begins not long after sunrise in the west and ends not long before sunset in the east. At that location, they are seen at higher altitudes and at most medium altitudes. At the furthermost areas of the far side within the near side, a part of the Earth is seen but only in the highest portions. Exception on one part of the Moon About ninety-one percent of the far side never experiences solar eclipses as the Earth is never seen there because the limit of the view of the planet during librations is about eight degrees within the near side. Eclipses are generally not seen in the fringes of the near side, within the far side, or in the lower and most of the middle parts. Around it, it is not seen in the lower parts. In that location and around it, the eclipses are never seen in most crater hollows or some of the lowest parts of some crater hollows. Eclipses are never seen in crater hollows in the polar regions where the sun never shines. Between the 75th and the 80th parallel north or south, eclipses are never seen in most crater hollows such as the middle and, notably, the lowest portions. History In early lunar history, after around 4.3 billion years, when the Moon was formed, it orbited closer to Earth. The totality of its eclipses lasted longer than current eclipses. Millions of years later, the totality shrank, and the partial portion of the eclipse was rising. Eclipses were more frequent around this time. Tens of millions of years later, eclipses became less numerous as the lunar orbit slowly moved away from the Earth. The view of the sun, even its chromosphere, was blocked by the Earth. Around some hundreds of millions of years ago, the Earth blocked all of the Sun's chromosphere; totality was slightly longer than the partial portion. At the same time, there were more partial eclipses on the Moon. As the Moon recedes about 3.8 centimeters each year, the eclipse totality length slowly shrinks, and the partial portion slowly lengthens. Saros series The Solar Saros series of the Moon is the equivalent to the Lunar Saros series of the Earth. In popular culture In a package of Wills's Cigarettes, one of the tobacco cards first issued in 1928 for a few years displays a solar eclipse on the Moon showing the atmospheric ring. This is considered the first depiction of a solar eclipse as seen on the Moon.

The Post-PC era is a market trend observed during the late 2000s and early 2010s involving a decline in the sales of personal computers (PCs) in favor of post-PC devices; which include mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers as well as other mobile computers such as wearable and ubiquitous ones. These devices emphasize portability and connectivity, including the use of cloud-based services, more focused \\"apps\\" to perform tasks, and the ability to synchronize information between multiple devices seamlessly. The term was first coined by MIT scientist David D. Clark. While both Microsoft's and Apple's former CEOs' Bill Gates and Steve Jobs also predicted a shift towards mobile devices as the primary method of computing, as a complement to the PC, Jobs popularized the term \\"post-PC\\" in 2007 (the launch of the first iPhone), and in 2011 launched iCloud, a service enabling Apple's product line to synchronize data with PCs through cloud services, freeing their iOS devices from dependency on a PC. Towards the middle of the 2010s, media sources began to question the existence of the post-PC era, at least as conventionally defined, stating that the so- called post-PC devices are just other portable forms of PCs joining traditional desktop PCs which still have their own operation areas and evolve. For example, gaming PCs are often considered still popular for many users. History The term \\"post PC\\" was first used by David D. Clark in 1999; considering the future of computing to be \\"inevitably heterogeneous\\" and a \\"network full of services\\". Clark described a world where \\"everything\\" would be able to connect to the internet (including watches and toasters), computing would primarily be done through information appliances, and data would be stored by centralized hosting services instead of on physical disks. In a 1999 op-ed piece for Newsweek, Microsoft's CEO Bill Gates predicted a landscape he dubbed \\"PC Plus\\", where personal computers would be used alongside devices which would seamlessly synchronize data (such as calendar events, files, e-mails, etc.) from a PC for easier accessibility from where a user would need it. At Macworld Expo in 2001, not long after the dot-com bubble burst and amidst industry-wide angst over the future of the PC, Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs announced a strategy seeing a PC (specifically, the Macintosh) serving as a \\"digital hub\\" for future mobile devices (such as its iPod MP3 player). Jobs stated that \\"We don't think the PC is dying at all. We don't think the PC is moving from the center at all. We think it's evolving. Just like it has since it was invented in 1975 and '76.\\" At an interview alongside Bill Gates at the 5th All Things Digital conference in 2007, Steve Jobs further described a concept similar to Gates' \\"PC Plus\\" known as a \\"post-PC device\\"; \\"a category of devices that aren't as general purpose, that are really more focused on specific functions, whether they're phones or iPods or Zunes or what have you. And I think that category of devices is going to continue to be very innovative and we're going to see lots of them\\". Jobs felt that despite these developments, PCs would \\"continue to be with us and morph with us, whether it's a tablet or a notebook or, you know, a big curved desktop that you have at your house or whatever it might be.\\" Gates suggested the prevalence of multiple form factors for such devices, including full-sized tablets, small phones, and 10-foot experiences for the living room. In June 2010, at the D8 conference, while being interviewed by Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, Jobs compared tablets and PCs to cars and trucks, saying \\"[PCs are] still going to be around. They‚Äôre still going to have a lot of value. But they‚Äôre going to be used by like one out of x people\\" while predicting that the vast majority of people will eventually use tablets as a primary computing device, analogous to the majority of people who drive cars. Directly conflicting Apple's previous \\"digital hub\\" strategy centered around the Macintosh PC, Steve Jobs unveiled Apple's iCloud platform in 2011, which provides cloud storage for data that can be automatically synced between iOS products and PCs. iOS 5, released concurrently with iCloud, also removed the platform's dependency on a PC for first-time setup, syncing, and software updates. Jobs explained that iCloud would replace the PC as the \\"hub\\" for a user's devices with online serversall of a user's devices, including a PC, would be able to automatically synchronize and access media and other files between platforms. Apple's current CEO Tim Cook continued to elaborate on the concept that a PC would no longer have to be the center of one's digital life, considering them to be a \\"device\\" on the same level as any portable device that a particular user owns. Cook also explained that mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones would be \\"more portable, more personal and dramatically easier to use than any PC has ever been\\". Technologically, Jason Perlow compared post-PC devices to the centralized mainframe-based computer systems of 1970sbut enhanced by the use of cloud computing to provide a more flexible and heterogeneous infrastructure for online services to run on, and the use of desktop virtualization to serve PC-only applications when needed as businesses shift towards apps. Matt Baxter-Reynolds felt that the main selling point of post-PC devices are their lack of functionality; believing that their more simplistic and secure design make them less intimidating to use for consumers in comparison to a traditional PC, their lack of keyboard (unlike laptops) contribute to better portability, and also noted their emphasis on connectivity as well. In 2014, Sony had sold off its PC division and VAIO brand. This, along with a drop in sales, led many to speculate the PC market was dying. However, the PC market did experience some periods of growth in the 2010s as well, leading many to claim the exact opposite. PC gaming grew 8% in 2012 alone and is expected to continue growing. In the second quarter of 2014, PC sales began to rise again. Growth of the PC compatible market was driven by strong sales of portable PCs in 2014. Proponents During an event that unveiled the 3rd generation iPad, Tim Cook reported that Apple had sold 172 million iPod, iPhone, and iPad products in 2011 alone (totaling 76% of the company's total revenue), and had sold more iPad tablets during the fourth quarter of 2011 than personal computers were sold worldwide. Likewise in the third quarter of 2012, worldwide PC sales dropped by 8.6% in comparison to 2011, and in July 2013, Gartner reported that the number of worldwide PC shipments had fallen for the fifth quarter in a row, marking the longest decline in the history of the PC industry. The threat of post-PC devices have also affected the producers of the x86 processors typically used by PCs; many smartphones and tablets use low-power ARM processors manufactured by companies such as Nvidia and Qualcomm instead of the x86 processors sold by companies such as Intel and AMD. The decline in PC sales has directly affected the sales of their processors; while Intel continued to gain market share over AMD in the third quarter of 2012, worldwide shipments of processors also declined by 9% in comparison to the third quarter of 2011. Several sources, including The Economist, have identified Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft as the four platform cloud companies which will be the key competitors in the post-PC era of mobile computing. Tech companies with a heavy dependency on PC sales such as Hewlett-Packard and Dell have seen decreased profits, while IBM has also struggled due to slowing demand for hardware and consulting services. Detractors Despite the decrease in PC sales, desktop computers and laptops still make up 84% of the global Web traffic as of March 2013. At its Worldwide Partner Conference in 2012, Microsoft's COO Kevin Turner attacked Tim Cook's declaration of a post-PC era for being \\"completely incorrect\\", and described its then-upcoming Windows 8 operating system as a \\"game-changer\\" for Bill Gates' \\"PC plus\\" landscape. Unlike Apple, whose mobile and PC devices both use different operating systems (iOS and OS X), Windows 8 was designed to accommodate both traditional PCs and tablets through its use of an updated interface optimized for touchscreen use, and its introduction of Windows Store, a service similar to the App Store for obtaining touch-optimized software. As a complement, Microsoft also introduced Windows RT, a special stripped down variant of the operating system built for devices that use the ARM architecture commonly used in smartphones and tablets. While Windows 8 devices (including tablets) are closer in nature to traditional PCs, Windows RT was designed to be a more closed down and \\"reliable\\" platform (closer in nature to other post-PC devices such as the iPad), and aside from included desktop programs such as Internet Explorer 10 and Office 2013, can only run apps. During a presentation in January 2012, Intel's senior vice president Tom Kilroy questioned the arrival of a post-PC era, citing a survey of college students where 66% of its respondents still considered the PC to be the \\"most important\\" device in their daily lives. In 2011, Intel introduced Ultrabook‚Äîspecifications and a marketing platform for a class of subnotebook with an emphasis on portability, responsiveness, productivity, and long- lasting battery life. In 2012, Intel introduced new Atom system-on-chip designs for Android smartphones and Windows 8 tablets, codenamed \\"Medfield\\" and \\"Clover Trail\\" respectively. Intel stated that Clover Trail tablets could achieve \\"all-day\\" battery life, and unlike Windows RT devices, still provide backward compatibility with applications designed for previous versions of Windows. Windows 8 also spurred OEM interest in \\"convertible\\" devices, a form factor of devices that can act as either a laptop or tablet, often by having a keyboard accessory they can be docked upon. While Google already produces the Android operating system used by many tablets and smartphones, it also introduced Chrome OSan operating system designed for personal computing built around its popular Chrome web browser, in 2009. Primarily shipping on netbooks known as Chromebooks, Chrome OS is designed for users who frequently use web applications and cloud-based services (such as Google's own Play and Drive)all of its \\"applications\\" are web applications, and the OS itself formerly used only a fullscreen web browser as its shell until an update in 2012, which introduced a desktop environment closer to that of other operating systems. Windows RT was ultimately cannibalized by low-end tablets running the standard Windows 8 operating system‚Äîa market incentivised by Microsoft's decision to optimize Windows 8.1 for these devices, and drop Windows OEM license fees on devices with screens smaller than 9 inches in size. By 2015, Microsoft had quietly mothballed Windows RT by ending the production of its remaining first- party devices. Windows 10 revised Microsoft's mobile strategy by focusing on unification of functionality between device classes, including an extension of Windows 8's app platform that allows software to be coded to support multiple device classes running a Windows 10-based operating system, and tailoring its user experience based on available input devices‚Äîparticularly on \\"convertible\\" laptops and tablets. Microsoft also presented Windows 10 Mobile, an iteration of Windows Phone for smartphones and tablets; the platform supports the ability for devices to be attached to an external display via a docking station, which allows use of a PC-like interface with USB mouse and keyboard support.

He was professor at the Berlin University of the Arts and still occasionally gives courses there.  Life and work  Byung-Chul Han studied metallurgy at Korea University in Seoul before he moved to Germany in the 1980s to study philosophy, German literature and Catholic theology in Freiburg im Breisgau and Munich. He received his doctoral degree at Freiburg with a dissertation on Martin Heidegger in 1994. In 2000, he joined the Department of Philosophy at the University of Basel, where he completed his habilitation. In 2010 he became a faculty member at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design, where his areas of interest were philosophy of the 18th, 19th and 20th century, ethics, social philosophy, phenomenology, cultural theory, aesthetics, religion, media theory, and intercultural philosophy. Since 2012 he has taught philosophy and cultural studies at the Universit√§t der K√ºnste Berlin (UdK), where he directs the newly established Studium Generale general-studies program. Han is the author of sixteen books, the most recent of which are treatises on what he terms a \\"society of tiredness\\" (M√ºdigkeitsgesellschaft), a \\"society of transparency\\" (Transparenzgesellschaft), and on his neologist concept of shanzhai, which seeks to identify modes of deconstruction in contemporary practices of Chinese capitalism. Han's current work focuses on transparency as a cultural norm created by neoliberal market forces, which he understands as the insatiable drive toward voluntary disclosure bordering on the pornographic. According to Han, the dictates of transparency enforce a totalitarian system of openness at the expense of other social values such as shame, secrecy, and trust. Until recently, he refused to give radio and television interviews and rarely divulges any biographical or personal details, including his date of birth, in public. Thought Much of Han's writing is characterised by an underlying concern with the situation encountered by human subjects in the fast-paced, technologically-driven state of late capitalism. The situation is explored in its various facets through his books: sexuality, mental health (particularly burnout, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), violence, freedom, technology, and popular culture. In The Burnout Society (original German title: M√ºdigkeitsgesellschaft), Han characterizes today's society as a pathological landscape of neuronal disorders such as depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality and burnout. He claims that they are not \\"infections\\" but \\"infarcts\\", which are not caused by the negativity of people's immunology, but by an excess of positivity. According to Han, driven by the demand to persevere and not to fail, as well as by the ambition of efficiency, we become committers and sacrificers at the same time and enter a swirl of demarcation, self-exploitation and collapse. \\"When production is immaterial, everyone already owns the means of production, him- or herself. The neoliberal system is no longer a class system in the proper sense. It does not consist of classes that display mutual antagonism. This is what accounts for the system's stability.\\"Han, \\"Psychopolitics\\" (2017), p. 13 Han argues that subjects become self-exploiters: \\"Today, everyone is an auto- exploiting labourer in his or her own enterprise. People are now master and slave in one. Even class struggle has transformed into an inner struggle against oneself.\\"Han, \\"Psychopolitics\\" (2017), p. 13 The individual has become what Han calls \\"the achievement-subject\\"; the individual does not believe they are subjugated \\"subjects\\" but rather \\"projects: Always refashioning and reinventing ourselves\\" which \\"amounts to a form of compulsion and constraint‚Äîindeed, to a \\"more efficient kind of subjectivation and subjugation.\\" As a project deeming itself free of external and alien limitations, the \\"I\\" subjugates itself to internal limitations and self- constraints, which are taking the form of compulsive achievement and optimization.Han, \\"Psychopolitics\\" (2017), p. 21 Agonie des Eros ('Agony of the Eros') carries forward Han's thoughts, which he developed in his earlier books The Burnout Society () and Transparency Society (), and synthesises the two earlier works into an interrogation of desire and love between humans. Based on an analysis of the characters in Lars von Trier's film \\"Melancholia\\", in which Han sees depicted depression and overcoming, he develops the image of a society that is increasingly dominated by narcissism and self-reference. Han's diagnosis extends even to the point of the loss of desire, the disappearance of the ability to devote to \\"the other\\", the stranger, the non- self. At this point, subjects come to revolve exclusively around themselves, unable to build relationships. Even love and sexuality are permeated by this social change: sex and pornography, exhibition/voyeurism and re/presentation, are displacing love, eroticism, and desire from the public eye. The abundance of positivity and self-reference leads to a loss of confrontation. Thinking, Han states, is based on the \\"untreaded\\", on the desire for something that one does not yet understand. It is connected to a high degree with Eros, so the \\"agony of the Eros\\" is also an \\"agony of thought\\". Not everything must be understood and \\"liked\\", not everything must be made available. In Topologie der Gewalt ('Topology of Violence'), Han continues his analysis of a society on the edge of collapse that he started with The Burnout Society. Focusing on the relation between violence and individuality, he shows that, against the widespread thesis about its disappearance, violence has only changed its form of appearance and now operates more subtly. The material form of violence gives way to a more anonymous, desubjectified, systemic one, that does not reveal itself, as it is merging with its antagonist ‚Äì freedom. This theme is further explored in \\"Psychopolitics\\", where through Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, Carl Schmitt, Richard Sennett, Ren√© Girard, Giorgio Agamben, Deleuze/Guattari, Michel Foucault, Michel Serres, Pierre Bourdieu and Martin Heidegger, Han develops an original conception of violence. Central to Han's thesis is the idea that violence finds expression in 'negative' and 'positive' forms (note: these are not normative judgements about the expressions themselves): negative violence is an overtly physical manifestation of violence, finding expression in war, torture, terrorism, etc; positive violence \\"manifests itself as over-achievement, over-production, over- communication, hyper-attention, and hyperactivity. The violence of positivity, Han warns, could be even more disastrous than that of negativity. Infection, invasion, and infiltration have given way to infarction.\\" Themes Han has written on topics such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality disorder, burnout, depression, exhaustion, internet, love, pop culture, power, rationality, religion, social media, subjectivity, tiredness, transparency and violence. Reception M√ºdigkeitsgesellschaft will soon be available in 11 languages. Several South Korean newspapers voted it to be the most important book in 2012. The Guardian wrote a positive review of his 2017 book Psychopolitics: Neoliberalism and New Technologies of Power, while the Hong Kong Review of Books praised his writing as \\"concise almost to the point of being aphoristic, Han's writing style manages to distill complex ideas into highly readable and persuasive prose\\" while noting that \\"on other occasions, Han veers uncomfortably close to billboard-sized statements (\\"Neoliberalism is the 'capitalism of' Like), which highlights the fine line between cleverness and self-indulgent sloganeering.\\" The Los Angeles Review of Books described him as \\"as good a candidate as any for philosopher of the moment.\\"  Works in English  * The Burnout Society (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2015) . * The Transparency Society (Stanford: Stanford Briefs, 2015) * Psychopolitics: Neoliberalism and New Technologies of Power (London & New York: Verso Books, 2017) * The Scent of Time: A Philosophical Essay on the Art of Lingering (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2017) * The Agony of Eros (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2017) * In the Swarm: Digital Prospects (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2017), * Shanzhai: Deconstruction in Chinese (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2017) * Saving Beauty (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2017) * The Expulsion of the Other: Society, Perception and Communication Today (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2018) * Topology of Violence (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2018) * What Is Power?

Renaissance allegory Despite her obscurity, Agenoria is the title character of the first of four Latin apologues written in 1497 by the Italian humanist Pandolfo Collenuccio in honor of Ercole II d'Este, duke of Ferrara. The allegorical fiction Agenoria, influenced by Lucian, begins with the betrothal of Inertia (Inactivity) to Labor, whose wedding gifts such as farm animals and sweat result in a breakup. Labor then weds Agenoria (Activity). Their wedding is attended by a number of other personifications, including Ubertas (Abundance) and Voluptas (Pleasure), whose presence arouses the violence of Inertia and her followers. The defeat of the virtuous company of Agenoria and Labor is prevented only by the deus ex machina intervention of Jupiter. One of the wedding guests, Politia (Civilization) then praises the contributions to human society made by Labor, Agenoria, and the other attendant virtues. Jupiter asserts that Agenoria is under his divine protection.David Marsh, Lucian and the Latins: Humor and Humanism in the Early Renaissance (University of Michigan Press, 1998), pp. 144‚Äì146.

At an altitude of around 375 metres on the sunny side of the Montg√≥, the cave is situated at the head of the ravine after which it is named. The site preserves an important group of schematic rock paintings, as well as multiple graves from the Calcolithic or copper age. Excavation In 2009 archaeological excavations were begun in the central hall of the cave. This space appears to have been a prehistoric funeral chamber as the remains of eight individuals have been recovered ‚Äì women, men and children - after three excavation campaigns. These remains were deposited in ‚Äúpackets‚Äù or bundles of bones, which indicates that they are‚Äù secondary‚Äù burials, i.e. the remains of the individuals buried in the cave had been transferred, already as skeletons, from another place. The dead were buried with objects later excavated in the burial site, the purpose of which was to assist the deceased in the passage to another life. To date, flint arrow heads, hand made ceramic vessels, an adze of polished stone and a copper awl have been found. Radiocarbon dating of the bones of some of the burials dates the remains to 4,683 years ago, in the late Neolithic times. The groups of humans who used the cave as a burial place and a site for schematic rock paintings belonged to communities that had settled in the valley. They lived in small hamlets dedicating themselves to agriculture and livestock farming, although hunting was also an important activity. Significance The cave of the Barranc del Migdia, visible from all over the valley of X√†bia, would have been easily identifiable for these peoples, a landmark of their connection to a site where the remains of their ancestors had rested for generations. It is a unique place, as it combines artistic representations of some of their concerns about life and religion, with a burial chamber which conveys their beliefs about death. Thousands of years later, firstly in Roman times and later at the end of the Moorish period, the cave served as a refuge and hiding place. A small treasure of Almohadian coins was hidden here. Some ten coins are conserved by the Soler Blasco Archeological Museum in Javea. Ongoing investigation The investigations in this site - studies of physical anthropology, DNA, stone age diet, vegetation environment, C14 radiocarbon dating, etc. ‚Äì have brought to light unknown aspects about these ancient settlers. This archeological investigation project directed by the Cirne Foundation brings X√†bia and the Montg√≤ into the field of modern European scientific investigation. They are currently awaiting the results of the DNA studies being conducted in the University of Mainz in Germany, which will specify the type of burial, whether it was a vault for families or for important people of the time.

A town was surveyed on pastoral lands known as \\"Taylors Flat\\" in 1857. The town was named for the British General George Cathcart, killed during the Crimean War.http://www.bombala.nsw.gov.au/pdfs/council/economic/cathcart.pdf At this time, the export of wool and meat to Tasmania and trade in native animal hides were the main economic activity in the areaBack to Cathcart Federation celebrations - Local News - News - General - Bombala Times The town would grow quickly, by virtue of its location on the route to Eden and the increased traffic associated with the discovery of gold at Kiandra becoming a significant local centre. At its peak, the town would boast three hotels, three churches, several sporting facilities, a racecourse and showgrounds, stock saleyards, a cemetery, a post office, a school and a police station. Additionally, there were several stores and two banks in the thriving town. Records show the estimated population of the district had reached 300 by 1901.Back to Cathcart - Local News - News - General - Bombala Times In 1865, a sawmill was established by Maurice McKinnery.

Cathcart Co-Operative Dairy Society Ltd opened a butter factory in the town in 1895, closing down in January 1927 when falling butter prices rendered it unprofitable. The last dairy farm at Cathcart shifted to grazing activities in 1964.

Angelo Capranica (c. 1415 -1478) (called the Cardinal of Santa Croce or the Cardinal of Rieti) was an Italian Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal. Biography Angelo Capranica was born in Rome around 1415, the son of de Niccol√≥ Pantagati da Capranica and his wife, Iacobella. He was the younger brother of Domenico Capranica, who became a cardinal in 1423 but was not recognized as such by Pope Eugene IV until much later. Angelo was elected Archbishop of Manfredonia on March 17, 1438. This may have been tied to his brother‚Äôs reconciliation with the pope. Angelo was transferred to the see of Ascoli Piceno by Pope Nicholas V on May 4, 1447, and then to the see of Rieti on September 25, 1450. Angelo also served as governor of Cesena and of Foligno. Shortly after his brother's death in August 1458, Pope Pius II named him governor of Bologna in September 1458. Domenico, shortly before his death, had founded a seminary in his palace, the Almo Collegio Capranica; the younger Capranica expanded the palace and opened it to students in 1460. In the consistory celebrated in Siena on March 5, 1460, Pope Pius II made Capranica a cardinal priest. Capranica entered Siena on March 21, 1460, receiving the red hat later that day. On March 26, 1460, he received the titular church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, his brother's former title. In April 1460, Angelo was appointed legate a latere to Bologna. He returned to Rome on December 31, 1460. He left Rome for Bologna a second time on May 18, 1461, returning on November 17. He left for Bologna a third time on February 23, 1463, before rejoining the papal court in Siena on March 24, 1464. Angelo participated in the papal conclave of 1464 that elected Pope Paul II. The new pope renewed Capranica's appointment as legate a latere on October 1, 1464, and he left for Bologna on January 12, 1465. He returned to Rome on November 27, then on May 6, 1466 left again for Bologna, returning to Rome on January 10, 1468. On January 9, 1469, Cardinal Capricana and Cardinal Roderic Llan√ßol i de Borja accompanied Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, from Rome to Viterbo. Angelo participated in the papal conclave of 1471 that elected Pope Sixtus IV. On November 23, 1471, the new pope named him papal legate to the Italian princes for the purposes of a new crusade against the Ottoman Turks. On December 11, 1472, Angelo became a cardinal bishop, taking the suburbicarian see of Palestrina, though retaining his titulus of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in commendam. Angelo Capranica was at times abbot in commendam of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Pancrazio in Florence and of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Basilio di Cavata in the diocese of Parma, as well as of the Benedictine monasteries of San Bartolomeo in Ferrara, Santa Sofia in Benevento and San Giovanni degli Eremiti in Palermo. Angelo became Archbishop of Fermo, his brother's former see, on April 9, 1473. He celebrated a synod there, but soon fell ill and returned to Rome on November 17, 1473, resigning the archbishopric on June 17, 1474. Capranica died in Rome on July 3, 1478. He is buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva in the same chapel as his brother. ReferencesFurther reading Chac√≥n, Alfonso, Vit√¶, et res gest√¶ Pontificvm Romanorum et S. R. E.

Synopsis=Plot The game begins with a young Han Yunxi, son and sole successor to a female village shaman, sneaking out of the village to play. His plan to take his best friend, Chu Chan, to see a rare golden fox is disrupted when they are attacked by a bear, causing Chu Chan to stop playing with him. Under his mother's orders, Yunxi enters the Cave of Ice and Fire to perform a village ritual. Inside the cave, he sees the Sword of Fenji within a magical seal. He finally emerges from the cave, only to witness a group of outsiders massacre his village. He passes out in shock, and wakes up in the cave beside his mother's dead body. Several years later, a 17-year-old Yunxi, now called Baili Tusu, has become the second disciple of Master Ziyin from the Tianyong sect that resides in the Kunlun Mountains. Tusu carries with him the Sword of Fenji, which has been released from the seal after the massacre. Vicious spirits residing within the sword torment him from time to time. Tusu leaves the mountains for the outside world to answer to the desperate pleas of a group of men kidnapped by bandits. He rescues Fang Lansheng, a young, talkative scholar, Ouyang Shaogong, a gentle, mild-mannered alchemy expert, and Ji Tong, Shaogong's elderly servant. Shaogong tells Tusu that he is trying to retrieve the stolen treasure of the Qingyutan sect: a special jade which can be used to create a potion to revive the dead. The jade has been broken into pieces, and are being used to absorb human souls. Hoping to revive his mother, Tusu proposes to help Shaogong find the fragments, in exchange for Shaogong to brew him the potion of resurrection. Tusu also vaguely recognises the jade, and is convinced that it will lead him to the true culprit behind the massacre. Tusu leaves the bandit camp for the town of Qinchuan. He passes by a mountain stream and runs into Feng Qingxue, who happens to be bathing in the stream. Taking him to be a voyeur, she immobilises him and takes away his Sword of Fenji as punishment. Tusu chases after Qingxue, but the evil spirits in the sword haunt him again when he finally catches up to her in Qinchuan, causing him to lose his mind. Tusu regains his consciousness to discover that he is on Shaogong's ship. By passing some of her chi to him, Qingxue was able to relieve him of his pain, something he thought was impossible. Qingxue, in search of her missing elder brother, joins Tusu and Shaogong in the search for the jade fragments. On the ship, they meet Xiang Ling, a half-fox who was also saved when Tusu cleared the bandit camp. Lansheng attempts to escape from an arranged marriage, meeting a lady named Hong Yu. The three of them join Tusu's party. Characters *Han Yunxi (Èü©‰∫ëÊ∫™), also called Baili Tusu (ÁôæÈáåÂ±†Ëãè), voiced by Chen Guang: The game's 17-year-old protagonist, whose village was massacred when he was eight. His most trustworthy companion is a white gyrfalcon he calls Xiang (ÈòøÁøî). Tusu constantly feeds it pork to prevent it from going on a hunt and possibly injuring civilians. This has unintentionally made the fierce predator resemble an overweight chicken. While normally cold and stoic, he also has a warm and childish side. \\"Tusu\\" is an alcoholic drink often consumed on the eve of the Lunar New Year to ward off evil spirits. He gives himself this name after the massacre as he wishes to protect everything he holds dear. *Feng Qingxue (È£éÊô¥Èõ™), voiced by Shen Qiuxiang: A kind, outgoing and innocent girl of 17 with a sweet smile. Her family lives in the underground world, and serves the goddess N√ºwa. At some point in time after the massacre of Tusu's village, she left the underground world in search of her missing brother. She is born with poison in her body, and always wears gloves to prevent direct contact with others. Her unbridled curiosity and a fear of loneliness compels her to explore the world and reach out to others. *Ouyang Shaogong (Ê¨ßÈò≥Â∞ëÊÅ≠), voiced by Peng Yao: 25 years old, he is from Qinchuan and a childhood friend of Fang Lansheng. Owing to his unrivalled expertise in alchemy, he has attained a prestigious elder status within the Qingyutan sect at a very young age. His weapon is an antique guqin. *Fang Lansheng (ÊñπÂÖ∞Áîü), voiced by Hui Long: an 18-years-old scholar at the Qinchuan school. He comes from an affluent family with five sisters. He leaves with Tusu to avoid an arranged marriage and falls in love with Xiang Ling. When in battle, he uses prayer beads to cast buddhist incantations that he learnt from his father, the head monk at a temple near Qinchuan. \\"Lansheng\\" was a royal alcoholic drink made from the petals of a hundred different flowers, showing that he grew up shielded by his elder sisters. \\"Lan\\" stands for \\"orchid\\", which symbolises a gentleman in Chinese culture. This reflects the high hopes his parents have for him. *Xiang Ling (Ë•ÑÈìÉ), voiced by Yan Mengmeng: A 16 years old half-fox, half-human girl. Ling was raised by Grandfather Banyan, a banyan spirit, after her parents abandoned her. A cute and lively child at heart, she loves romance and dreams of meeting her prince charming. \\"Xiang Ling\\" is a type of baijiu with a sweet and refreshing taste, which brings to mind her purity. She uses an ornate Chinese hand fan to cast spells and buffs. *Yin Qianshang (Â∞πÂçÉËßû), voiced by Lu Kui: A 27-year-old broadsword fighter who enjoys gambling and drinking; Feng Qingxue says he looks like her older brother, who disappeared a long time ago. *Hong Yu (Á∫¢Áéâ), voiced by Xu Xiaoqing: A beautiful and mysterious 25-year-old lady who is rather experienced for her age. She wields dual swords. *Ziyin (Á¥´ËÉ§), a legendary and mysterious elder in the Tianyongcheng sect who has reached immortal status. He has an enormous collection of swords, many of which are crafted by himself.

History The origin of classical acting stems from an acting system created by Russian actor and director Konstantin Stanislavski who rose to prominence in the late 1800s and early 1900s. His system was that of both script analysis and personal exploration to find \\"the truth\\" of a part‚Äîor rather what would be truthful to the actor portraying the part. The precise system was based on having an expressive and responsive body to relay detailed and nuanced character portrayals, as well as addressing the creation of an inner life. Stanislavski's theories were published in the translated 1936 book An Actor Prepares. The training included: * An emphasis on physical acting, or physical actions * Imagination as a way to find character and relate to other actors * The super-objective and \\"through line of actions\\" in analyzing the script, including the main essence * Exploring subtext * Personalizing through emotional memory‚Äî real life and imagined experiences Another influential theorist of classical acting in the early-to mid-1900s was Michel Saint-Denis, a French actor and theater director who founded The London Theatre Studio and dedicated much of his career to experimental theatre. He incorporated many of Stanislavski's techniques into his teaching, as well as improvisation and sense memory, seeking a balance between external and internal techniques. Actors Alec Guinness, Jessica Tandy, and Laurence Olivier were some of his first students. Later on, he developed a training model that was incorporated by many university drama programs. Education Classical acting today is available for study in universities, drama conservatories, and acting studios across the world. Schools that are attached to or affiliated with a professional classical theatre company give students exposure and opportunity beyond simply the education. Examples of schools or studios with classical acting programs include: * University of London's Drama Conservatoire: This Masters of Acting program draws on theories of Michel Saint-Denis with training of the body, voice, and imagination. There is an emphasis on re- interpretation and re-imagining, with equal parts of art and craft in the education. Classical texts of Greek tragedy and Shakespeare are utilized, as well as modern plays. * CNSAD The Conservatoire national sup√©rieur d'art dramatique (English: French National Academy of Dramatic Arts): France's national drama academy located in Paris. It is a higher education institution run by the French Ministry of Culture and, with an acceptance rate of two to three percent and an average graduating class of thirty students, widely considered the most selective acting conservatory in France, is consistently regarded as a top world-class performing arts institute renowned for its excellence in theatre education. * The Juilliard School Drama Division in New York: The School has both a B.F.A. and M.F.A. program that emphasizes intuition and spontaneity, as well as discipline, technique, and intellectual development. There is both vocal and physical training, with script and word analysis, style work, and risk taking with imagination. * Montreal's National Theatre School of Canada: This three-year conservatory training program focuses on learning the craft and art of acting through the contemporary theatre, applying techniques of voice, singing, and movement. The School ascribes to the philosophies of Michel Saint-Denis, which includes exploration, writing, studio presentations, imagination, improvisation, \\"the mask\\", and audition preparation. * The Berg Studios in Los Angeles: The Studios offer a series of classes at various levels to explore classical acting technique and imagination, including developing of a repeatable acting system, script analysis, physical movement, self-discovery through imagination, and illuminating the dialogue through subtext. * Andrew Wood Acting Studio in Los Angeles: Andrew Wood Acting Studio offers classes in which students learn an approach to acting taught at the Yale School of Drama. The approach emphasizes visceral activation of the actor through deep examination of circumstances and personalization. * Yale School of Drama in New Haven, Connecticut: In its M.F.A. program, a strong imagination is encouraged and developed, along with physical and vocal work. Actors are also given extensive production work opportunities, working with director, dramaturgs, and playwrights to create theatre pieces and learn from the collaborative process. Using the body as a source of inspiration and expression of work is a focus of the first year training. Later, text analysis, voice, and speech work are integrated. * The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol, United Kingdom: Opened in 1946 by Laurence Olivier, this South West England school offers a highly selective B.A. Honors of Professional Acting conservatory program. The first year focuses on voice and body, moving onto public productions, and then to preparation for a professional career. The school also provides short courses for the general public who has had some experience or training in acting and wants to broaden skills; the classical acting classes include learning opportunities in voice, movement, verse speaking, improvisation, and stagecraft. * London Academy of Performing Arts (LAPA), was a boutique Classical acting school, until its closure in 2005. * Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts was founded in 1911 by actress Italia Conti, their drama school course offers a BA (Hons) in Acting.
