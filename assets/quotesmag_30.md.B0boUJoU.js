The Feria also incorporates musical events, dance performances, food and beverage tastings and had had talks by folk art experts such as Marta Turok, Susana Valadez and Marc Navarro. There have also been exhibitions of the making of objects and fashion shows to highlight the importance of traditional garments. History The idea for the Feria originated with Marianne Carlson, an American expat living in Chapala, Jalisco, who went to tour seventeen craft villages around Lake Patzcuaro in 2002. There she found craft traditions unknown to most people, and which instead were only sold in local markets and fairs. She decided to organize a handcrafts and folk art fair in Chapala later that same year, with thirteen artisans participating. The original idea was to begin it as a business, but after the first event, Carlson decided against this. Since it began, the event has grown in size, both in volunteers and participating artisans, having had artisans from sixteen of Mexico‚Äôs 32 federal entities. The Feria association became a non- profit in 2008. In 2012, the group sponsored the making of a giant cartoner√≠a (paper mache) alebrije by Alejandro Camacho of Xochimilco for the Mexico City Monumental Alebrije parade in 2012.

It is based on Alexandre Dumas' 1847-1850 novel of the same name. It was written by Keith Dewhurst. The plot takes place years after The Three Musketeers (1986) ‚Äì even though the latter animated film was released one year later ‚Äì and it is known for a scene that displays a complex fireworks animation, as well for its bittersweet ending. The film consists of 53 minutes in length and features the voices of Colin Friels as King Louis XIV, Gwen Plumb as P√©ronne and John Meillon in the role of Porthos. It was produced by Tim Brooke-Hunt and originally premiered on television. The Man in the Iron Mask is nowadays considered to be in the public domain.  Synopsis  The three Musketeers have discovered, through D'Artagnan, the existence of Phillipe, a twin brother of Louis, the King of France. The hidden brother is always imprisoned, and nobody knows his face, which is always covered with a mask of iron closed with padlock. Tired of the cruelty and tyranny with which Louis punishes the French people, the Musketeers decide to free Phillipe and replace Louis with him, so nobody knows of the change and a new monarch can thus rule the country with justice and equity. However, the heroic group's plan suffers a series of setbacks and it ends in an unexpected way.

Services at Tabernacle were held in the English language. Early history The origins of the church at Tabernacle can be traced back to 1841 when services were held in the Long Room of the New Inn, Aberdare. Members from both Siloa, Aberdare and Saron, Aberaman were involved in the formation of Tabernacle. The main aim was to provide English language services for this migrants unable to speak or understand Welsh, which was the language of worship at almost all the nonconformist chapels in the locality. The first chapel was built in 1856, designed by B. Owen of Merthyr Tydfil and built at a cost of ¬£823. It had seating for 450 people. The foundation stone was laid on 7 March 1856 by the Hon. Mrs Thompson, Chepstow. In 1857, Tabernacle had 156 members with 136 in the Sunday School. Within three years the building was too small. A new building was therefore built, at a cost of ¬£800. It was designed by W.S. Rampling and built by W. Rees. The chapel was of a primarily Gothic designs, like many English Congregationalist chapels in the Aberdare Valley. The design was said to have been decided by the landowner the Marquis of Bute. The first minister was John Cunnick from 1857 until 1860. Membership was never large and peaked at around 200 in 1923. Twentieth Century In 1915, T. Madoc Jeffreys was inducted as minister of Tabernacle. Jeffreys became a prominent figure in the locality and a member of Glamorgan County Council at the 1919 election. In chapel closed in 1970 and its furnishings distributed among other chapels in the locality. The site was later occupied by Tesco and Wilkinsons stores.

The project began under the presidency of Pompeu Fabra i Poch with the creation of the \\"Spelling Rules\\", the \\"Spelling Dictionary\\" and the \\"Grammar\\". After four years' preparation, the Philological Section published the first edition of the \\"General Dictionary of the Catalan language\\" (DGLC), the DIEC's predecessor, in 1932, and it managed to unify the spelling system, cleanse the lexicon, fix the grammar and introduce neologisms.Antoni Ferrando Franc√©s i Miquel Nicol√°s Amor√≥s, Hist√≤ria de la llengua catalana, Volum 20 de Biblioteca Oberta, Barcelona, Editorial UOC, 2011, p√†gina 503, The DGLC began to be considered the official dictionary of the Catalan language from 1954 onwards, when the second edition was published. During the decade of 1980s Catalan authors and writers began to ask the IEC to revise the dictionary, because they considered that the language had evolved quite a lot since the time of Fabra. Towards the end of 1992 from within the IEC there arose a determination to publish a new standard dictionary. The project began immediately, with the economic support of the regional government, the Generalitat of Catalonia. The first edition of the new dictionary, the Dictionary of the Institute of Catalan Studies, was finished in December 1994 and published in September 1995.¬´Distinci√≥ merescuda: El govern de la Generalitat concedeix la medalla d'or, el seu m√†xim guard√≥, a l'Institut d'Estudis Catalans i a l'Abadia de Poblet¬ª El Punt Avui, 1 de setembre de 2010, p√†gina 29 Shortly afterwards there were two reprints, which added, modified and removed a number of words.

Differences between the DGLC and the DIEC  The idea for a new dictionary arose due to the ever-larger differences between the lexicon employed in the DGLC and current usage. The project for the creation of the DIEC did not start from scratch, therefore, but began by building on the DGLC, and retained some of its features. Apart from updating the lexicon, the main advances in the new dictionary are its size (it is a third larger than the DGLC), the way in which the articles are ordered and the perfecting of the spelling.Mestres i Serra, J. \\"El Diccionari de la llengua catalana de l'Institut d'Estudis Catalans\\". In this last field the standardisation of affixes, the updating of the use of the hyphen and specific changes, for etymological reasons, in accenting and writing are worthy of note. The DIEC has been further extended in the field of nomenclature and in the content of the articles. As for the lexicon, it has mostly expanded in the fields of science and technology and in dialectal words and slang. There are 30 more thematic areas than in its predecessor.

He is also known as the graffiti artist ‚ÄúBuda‚Äù. He is a recognized pioneer in both graffiti and rave culture. Originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he is credited by authors Roger Gastman and Caleb Neelon in their, \\"The History of American Graffiti\\" as being \\"Pittsburgh‚Äôs first graffiti superstar\\" and inventor of the ‚Äúmonster rock style‚Äù of graffiti lettering. He is also recognized for instigating Pittsburgh's rave scene in 1991. In 2005 part of his techno dance music collection was a notable acquisition of the US Library of Congress: Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division. Graffiti Deadly Buda graffiti art in Venice, CA 2015 In 1985, Bevacqua chose the tag name ‚ÄúBuda‚Äù while doing a book report on Buddhism for a junior high school social studies class. He would frequently travel to New York City where he would meet and learn from graffiti artists at Henry Chalfant‚Äôs Soho studio at 64 Grand Street, like Tracy 168 and T Kid 170. Wanting to be better than anyone in New York, Buda developed a new lettering style he called ‚ÄúMonster Rock.‚Äù Most New York graffiti lettering styles were drawn in such a way as to give the illusion of 3-dimensionality. However the ‚Äú3-D‚Äù as the graffiti writers called this illusion, usually only went in one direction, so that the letters looked like a cohesive block coming from a singular direction even when they were complex wildstyle letters. ‚ÄúMonster Rock‚Äù differed in that the ‚Äú3-D‚Äù twisted and deformed in such a way as to make it appear that the letters were coming from different directions, as if it were a moving, organic form. The first appearance of the Monster Rock style was executed in Millvale, PA, and appeared in the book ‚ÄúSpraycan Art‚Äù by Henry Chalfant and James Prigoff. The style was influential to graffiti writers. Twisting ‚Äú3-D‚Äù is now a common stylistic element of modern graffiti art. Rave Promoter and DJ Bevacqua's interest in DJing began in the mid-1980s. He was first interested in Hip Hop music. A neighbor who happened to be a disco DJ heard him \\"scratching\\" records from across the street, and offered to teach him to DJ and gave him records in exchange for mowing his lawn. On choosing the name \\"Deadly Buda\\", Bevacqua said that he wanted to capitalize on his graffiti notoriety, and at the same time sound like a kung-fu dj name like \\"Grandmaster Flash\\". DJ Deadly Buda's first appearance occurred on December 13, 1991 in West View, PA (a municipality in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area) at the Psychotronic Slack Rave, which he co-promoted with the Slacker clothing store. He co-DJ‚Äôed with DJ Controlled Weirdness from the United Kingdom. The two DJs would form the rave production group ‚ÄúHear to Go‚Äù inspired by the Brion Gysin book Here to Go: Planet R-101. In 1992 he opened one of America's first rave record stores, Turbo-Zen Records. The record store would sponsor events such as Power Rave, Hi-Voltage and Soul. The flyer for Hi-Voltage, which was drawn and written by Buda and also printed on T-shirts, contained the quote \\"Technology must be used to liberate the individual.\\" Dan Mross, the Bitcoin miner featured in the documentary \\"The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin\\" cites the quote as an inspiration that described his later interest in the Bitcoin technology. On August August 13, 2017, Deadly Buda released the DJ mix \\"Rock the Blockchain\\" on Musicoin.org. The DJ mix was the first ever to utilize a cryptocurrency blockchain (Musicoin) and its smart contracts to quickly pay (usually within seconds) the individual tracks and their artists. Writing and Publishing In the early 1990s, Deadly Buda began writing scene reports and record reviews for several popular rave fanzines, most notably the Brooklyn-based fanzine Under One Sky, published by Heather Heart, and was even quoted by Charles Aaron in the July 1994 edition of Spin magazine. His writing was also prominently featured in ‚ÄúSlurp!‚Äù a rave publication from Philadelphia. Other fanzines or magazines that he wrote for were: Alien Underground (UK) - which later became Datacide magazine, and who published his popular underground article ‚ÄúThe Morphing Culture‚Äù which proposed a new classification of rave music. Milwaukee's ‚ÄúMassive‚Äù Magazine, Streetsounds (Canada), Raveline (Germany), Freebase (Los Angeles), and Now?! (Pittsburgh). Since 2015, Bevacqua has written several popular articles concerning hard electronic music and rave culture for the LA Weekly (online and print), insomniac.com, and The Hard Data (a website and print magazine that he began publishing in 2015). According to the LA Weekly website, some of his articles have gotten over 5000 Facebook shares. Some of the more popular articles have been: ‚ÄúInside the World of the Kandi Kids, Dance Music's Most Colorful Subculture‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs America Ready for Rawstyle, the Hardest Offshoot of EDM Yet?‚Äù, and ‚Äú10 Hardcore Techno Tracks for People Who Don‚Äôt Know Shit About Hardcore‚Äù. Music Production Deadly Buda's music has appeared on the following electronic music record labels. Sounds (a sub-label of Communique), Praxis, Level 2, Mokum, Fukem, Atomic Hardcore, and his own label, Deadly Systems. In 2017 Deadly Buda's track \\"King of Style\\" was released on Industrial Strength Records. The track and its video features audio and video samples from the hip hop documentary Style Wars.

The first two editions of the festival were held in September 2014 and July 2015. The festival is produced by Superfly and sponsored by both Pabst Brewing Company and Stubhub.  Location and Format  Ross Island Bridge in Portland, OR The Project Pabst festival takes place near the Ross Island Bridge on Portland's South Waterfront. The exact location is at 3030 SW Moody Ave, Portland, OR 97201. There are two main stages on 10 acres in Portland's South Waterfront near the restored Zidell Yards. In 2015, the festival ran for two days on Saturday, July 18 and Sunday, July 19. For both the 2014 and the 2015 festival, the basic format of consisted of 8 bands each day spanned across the two stages, so 16 bands total. Pabst encourages all attendees to walk, bike, or skate. Since Portland is very economically friendly parking is limited at the event. Project Pabst has a Park to Walk program where they have a parking garage specifically for the event you can pay to park and walk 1.2 miles to the event. They also have valet parking for bikes and skateboards only.  History  Pabst Blue Ribbon beer was established in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1844, by a German immigrant, Jacob Bests. Throughout the years Pabst beer went through a decline in popularity and their sales were plummeting. However, Portland, Oregon played an integral part in bringing the American beer back to life. Since the 1970s, Pabst had seen a decline in their sales until the early 2000s, when their sales started going up again. Portland was sourced as being one of the main proponents of this change. Pabst became very popular due to its image as a cheap, working class, beer that did not try to buy their way with excessive advertisements. In creating the Project Pabst festival, Pabst Brewing Company hoped for it to be a \\"love letter to Portland\\". In their initial ideas for the logo of the festival, they made the Portland's Old Town sign into their Project Pabst logo. Portland‚Äôs Old Town sign is an outline of the State of Oregon with ‚ÄúPortland, Oregon Old Town,‚Äù written in the middle. At the top of the sign, there is a giant deer jumping over the logo. The deer represents Oregon since deer live all over the state. Pabst liked the idea of the sign and made a similar one with the outline of the state of Oregon and their logo is ‚ÄúProject Pabst Portland Oregon.‚Äù Instead of using the deer in the logo, though, they decided to make it a unicorn instead. That day, Pepper, the Pabst Blue Ribbon Unicorn was born. Portland‚Äôs city board was unsure of the logo though, and they ended up turning Pabst down and pushing the dates back of when they would accept it. There was some controversy behind this decision though and the rejected sign was still used throughout the 2014 Project Pabst festival. Project Pabst Unicorn is a symbol Pabst Brewing Company created six weeks before the Project Pabst event. They had a huge team creating the 22 foot Unicorn, which stood at the center of the festival. PBR, Figure Plant, Superfly, and David Korins design all came up with the idea of having a unicorn and they helped design Pepper, the giant Unicorn statue, with a light up horn that lights up the colors of the rainbow. There's a myth in Portland that the city was built on a Unicorn burial site and that it used to be the ‚Äúcity of Unicorns.‚Äù  Lineup  Killer Mike and El-P of Run The Jewels The headliners for the 2014 festival were Modest Mouse and Tears for Fears. For 2015, the main headlining bands were: Weezer, Against Me!, and Run the Jewels. The full lineup of bands for the 2015 show was: * Blondie * TV on the Radio * Against Me! * Run the Jewels * Thee Oh Sees * The Velvet Teen * Priory * Hustle and Drone * Weezer * Passion Pit * Buzzcocks * The Both (Aimee Man/ Ted Leo) * Alvvays * Terry and Louie * Wampire * The Wild Ones  Night Shows  Inside Portland's Crystal Ballroom Project Pabst 2015 also incorporated a handful of night shows at other venues in the Portland area to the festival. These shows ran at night from July 16‚Äì19, 2015 after the daytime festival had finished. These night shows and their venues included:  Crystal Ballroom  Saturday - BadBadNotGood, Ghostface Killah, and Del the Funky Homosapien  Dante‚Äôs  Friday - The Spits, The Epoxies, Long Knife Saturday - Oblivians, Pure Country Gold, Bobby Peru Sunday - The Mummies, Gaythiest, Sex Crime  Star Theater  Friday - The Sonics, Pierced Arrows, Fireballs of Freedom Saturday - Roky Erickson, The Pynnacles, Hollow Sidewalks  Revolution Hall  Friday - Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Son Little Saturday - Earth  Doug Fir  Thursday - Brian Posehn, Bryan Cook, Sean Jordan Friday - Shannon and the Clams, Chastity Belt, The Shivas Saturday - Fernando, Jeremy Wilson, Mike Coykendall  Mississippi Studios  Friday - Tacocat, The Ghost Ease, Shadowlands Saturday - The Coathangers, Is/Is, Marriage + Cancer  Ash St. Saloon  Friday - Jex Thoth, Ides of Gemini, Clay Rendering, Barrowlands Saturday - Subrosa, Brothers of the Sonic Cloth, Lesbian, Eight Bells  Bunk Bar  Friday - Chrome  Activities  Aside from the live bands, there are a number of entertainment activities set up on the festival grounds. These activities are open to any and all people attending the Project Pabst festival.  PBRcade  In an attempt to emulate the bar-like atmosphere in which Pabst has built their empire, a small bar is set up on the festival grounds for attendees to take a break in. The bar houses pinball machines, arcade games, and local music. All games are completely free to play.  Pabst VANdalism  The Pabst Van is set up on the festival premises and is treated as a communal art piece. Festival attendees are encouraged to use spray paint to decorate the van in whatever manner they please.  Pabst Wax  In this small recording booth, attendees can jump in and create their own music. These recording are then cut directly into vinyl and people can walk away with their own record demo.  #NoMoFoMo  This booth stands for No More Fear of Missing Out. In it, there is a live DJ booth set up where festival attendees can watch and listen to performances as well as connect with social media. This booth is sponsored by StubHub.  Food  Local food vendors at the festival include: Atlas Pizza, Boke Bowl, Fifty Licks Ice Cream, Olympic Provisions and Slowburger.  Reception  Project Pabst was received well amongst fans and deemed a complete success in the eyes of Pabst Brewing Company. Despite temperatures around 100 degrees for the 2015 edition, 15,000 fans attended over the two-day festival. Weezer, Against Me!, Blondie, and Run The Jewels were the biggest crowd-pleasers of the 2015 lineup. The amount of activities to partake in throughout the festival was also a main point of praise. With the temperatures so hot, Project Pabst‚Äôs decision to allow sealed water bottles to be brought into the festival, as well as the inclusion of on-site refills, was something fans were very thankful for. Especially since limiting water and inflating prices on water is something that is done often at festivals. In 2014, the average cost of a bottle of water at festivals was $4 and the average cost of a beer was $8.50. 16oz Tallboys of Pabst Blue Ribbon only cost $4 at the Project Pabst, which is more than you‚Äôd pay at a bar, but less than half of what most festivals would charge. Overall, it seems Project Pabst has been very successful and well received.  Impact  Project Pabst was produced by the relatively new festival producer, Superfly. Superfly co-produced the most recent Bonnaroo and Outside Lands festivals. Pabst Brewing Company was only expecting 10,000 attendees over the two-day Project Pabst festival and instead, ended up getting 15,000. For such a small, indie brewing company, having their own festival is a big step. The festival ended up costing around 12 percent of their annual marketing budget. As a result, Pabst Brewing Company saw an increase of 25,000 cases of Pabst sold this year in the Portland market.

Early life  A native of Canon City, Colorado, he graduated from Colorado College and spent some time in Dartmouth College before his studies were interrupted by World War I. He eventually completed his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1921 under Nobel laureate Albert Michelson and Henry Gale.  Career  After teaching in the University of the Philippines, he became a professor at Caltech in 1923, remaining there until he retired in 1964 as professor emeritus. His research focused on \\"electromagnetic studies, the separation of isotopes, isolation of radioactive potassium and other elements, and the isotope ratio of oxygen.\\" In 1926, Smythe was the first to propose ion-velocity spectrometers, which he eventually built with Josef Mattauch. Smythe taught at least six Nobel Prize laureates: Charles Townes, Donald Glaser, William Shockley, Carl Anderson, James Rainwater, and Edwin McMillan, who won the Chemistry prize. He authored a textbook on electromagnetism called Static and Dynamic Electricity, which was a widely used reference in the field during the 20th century. His electromagnetism course was modeled after the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos examinations and designed to \\"weed out weaklings.\\" Smythe's course was so infamous that future Nobel Prize in Economics laureate Vernon Smith switched to electrical engineering from physics to avoid it.

Sportradar provides services to bookmakers, national and international sports federations, and media companies. As of January 2016, the company has 35 offices in 24 countries around the world including Trondheim, London and Ljubljana. Sportradar's products includes live results and statistics and white-label sports content. Through the brand Betradar, Sportradar operates a suite of tools for bookmakers, including in-game and pre-match odds suggestions, resulting, market monitoring and trading services. Through the US subsidiary, Sportradar US, Sportradar is the official data provider of the US sports federations NFL, NHL and NASCAR. At the end of 2015 Sportradar renewed the partnership with the International Tennis Federation as their official data collection service partner. In 2016, Sportradar entered into a partnership with the NBA, the third partnership with The Big Four. Since 2005, the company has had a partnership with German Football Association to detect fraud and match fixing. This system was later developed and launched as Fraud Detection System. In addition to detection of fraud, Sportradar organizes integrity workshops together with federations such as Major League Soccer, Serie A and International Ice Hockey Federation. These workshops teach clubs and players about how the betting market works, the different forms of match fixing and how match manipulation is detected. History Sportradar started as Market Monitor, which was founded in 2000 in Trondheim, Norway, by Petter Forn√¶ss and Tore Steinkjer. Market Monitor provided services for online bookmakers based on crawler technology developed as part of a thesis at Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Market Monitor together with Austrian and German partners, created the product Betradar.com in 2001. Betradar.com provides a set of reporting and monitoring tools for the online betting markets. Carsten Koerl joined Market Monitor as a major investor, obtaining 51% of the shares. In 2007, Sportradar AG was founded by the owners of Market Monitor and served as a parent company for the various companies in the group. Market Monitor was renamed to Sportradar AS and became a subsidiary of Sportradar AG. In 2012, Sportradar acquired the Slovenian development company Klika. Later the same year EQT acquired a minority stake by investing 44 million Euro in the company. Sportradar's expansions continued in 2013, with Sportradar became the majority shareholder of Usk-based Sportstat. In 2013 Sportradar also advanced into the US market by acquiring SportsData (now Sportradar US). In September 2014 Sportradar has become a shareholder of NSoft, a software company from Bosnia and Herzegovina that offers an omnichannel betting solution for betting and gambling operators. Sportradar holds 40% of NSoft's shares.https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/2893/nsoft EQT reinvested in Sportradar in 2014 by EQT's flagship fund buying the shares of EQT's Capital Expansion II. In 2015, Sportradar obtained exclusive distribution rights for NASCAR, NFL and NHL. The same year, Sportradar attracted investments from Michael Jordan and Mark Cuban led by Revolution LLC. National Football League also acquired equity in Sportradar US as part of the partnership. In 2016, Sportradar acquired the core business of Sportman Media Holding, including Laola1. Later that year, NBA announced a multi-year partnership with Sportradar involving integrity services, data distribution and video streaming. Sport integrity services Sportradar provides federations and law enforcement agencies with a system for detecting betting related match fixing. These services are operated by Sportradar's Security Services division, with headquarters in London, England. Sportradar's sport integrity services began with Early Warning System developed in 2005 following the Hoyzer scandal. The use of this system was one of the measures Bundesliga took to prevention further match fixing. The system was further developed to include live monitoring, and was relaunched in 2009 as Fraud Detection System (FDS). The development of FDS was done in cooperation with UEFA. Through this partnership, Sportradar monitors suspicious matches in the two top leagues of every UEFA member nation. FDS has since then expanded its partnerships to other sports and federations, including CONCACAF, FIBA, ESL and IOC. Sportradar has also signed agreements with several law enforcement agencies, most notably Europol and the Australian Federal Police. Fraud Detection System works by comparing odds movement patterns from online bookmakers with the expected odds movement patterns for a given match. When suspicious matches are found, they are analyzed and then reported to the relevant federation. The federation can then start their own investigations. As of 2015, Fraud Detection System monitors 65 000 matches across 11 sports, half of them in soccer. Daily, the system receives roughly 5 billion odds adjustments from around 450 different bookmakers. Since the launch of Fraud Detection System, Sportradar has been involved in several notable match fixing cases, such as the Nepal scandal in 2015, the Austrian case including Sanel Kuljiƒá in 2013, and the Australian match fixing case in 2013. The system has indicated that since 2009, more than 2000 events have likely been manipulated. In addition, Sportradar provides workshops for clubs and federations to educate them on the consequences of match fixing.

Sports betting services Through the brand Betradar, Sportradar provides bookmakers with a number of sports betting services. As of 2015, Sportradar has partnered with roughly 450 bookmakers including Bet365, William Hill, Paddy Power and Ladbrokes. The Sportradar services are also used by state lotteries such as Veikkaus, Svenska Spel and Norsk Tipping. Sportradar create odds for thousands of games across 40 sports. The odds are created by feeding sports data collected by Sportradar into mathematical models. For in- game betting odds, this requires continuous recalculation of the outcomes using the live data that Sportradar collects or acquires through licenses. These odds are sold as odds suggestions to bookmakers for matches the bookmakers are unable to create their own odds for. Similarly, Sportradar provides information to bookmakers about when matches start and finish so they do not allow money being placed on matches that are finished. A subset of Sportradar's collected data goes through an extensive quality assurance process specialised for bet clearing. Sportradar also provides market monitoring, which allows bookmakers to compare their odds with the rest of the market. Bookmakers have to provide their own odds to make use of this service, thus making their own odds a part of the comparison with other bookmakers. This service allows bookmakers to ensure they are not in an unwanted surebet situation. On August 12, 2019, Sportradar extended its relationship with the National Football League to become the exclusive provider of official league data to sports betting operators in the United States and internationally in jurisdictions where betting is legal and regulated. Sportradar will also use its integrity services to monitor betting on all NFL games and will have the right to distribute live audiovisual feeds of NFL games to sportsbooks in select international markets. Federation partnerships Sportradar has partnered with several sports federations to collect or distribute sports data. For Handball-Bundesliga Sportradar both collects and distributes official data, while for the ITF, the umpire enters the data directly into the Sportradar systems. For NHL, Sportradar ingests and redistributes the data coming from NHL's tracking system. The partnerships with the US federations NASCAR, NHL and NFL are handled through the US subsidiary, Sportradar US, partly in order to avoid conflict of interest between the federation and Sportradar's involvement with the betting industry. Distribution partnerships; these include creating web sites and other services, such as the rights to stream video content. Partnerships such as the one with ESL include using the data to expand Sportradar's betting services. Under a deal signed in October 2015, Sportradar will provide The Football Association of Malaysia a platform for managing its federation.

This ritual is often performed with the goal of avoiding school or work the next day. Specific Snow Dance rituals vary from person to person, but commonly include sleeping with silverware under one's pillow, flushing ice cubes in a toilet, or wearing your pajamas inside out and backwards. Snow dancing and is often performed outside in sunny or rainy conditions as the participating dancer would want it to snow that day or week, rather than be rainy or sunny.\\"Students' Flaky Rituals to Ensure Snow.\\" Tribunedigital-baltimoresun. N.p., 09 Dec. 2002. Web. 30 Nov. 2015. Considered by many to be an urban legend, the Snow Dance is often referred to in jest. Origin of tradition Rituals to invoke a desired weather pattern have historically been performed by Native American, Chinese, Slavic, and Romanian descendants and are still done today. These rituals have been executed and admired for purposes ranging from religious beliefs to celebration ceremonies. Examples of such rituals include Rain Dance Ceremonies, Rainmaking, Sun Dance ceremonies, and other weather modification rituals.Young, Gloria A. \\"Sun Dance.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. The Oklahoma Historical Society. Accessed 28 December 2013. While in contemporary society the Snow Dance is done typically in hope of no school, snow dances have historically been performed for the turn of a season and/or a change in the hunting season. Rain dances are commonly performed during a drought.\\"Rain Dance\\". Indians.org. American Indian Heritage Foundation. Retrieved 4 September 2011. The hope behind the dance: Snow days The snow dance is primarily performed in hope of a snow day. A snow day is when school districts deem roads too dangerous for teachers and students to drive to school, and school is cancelled. Adults may also take a personal snow day from work if they are unwilling to risk driving on the snow. Typical snow day activities include sledding, building snowmen, making snow igloos, leaving footprint trails, making snow angels, and shoveling the driveway and sidewalks. Those who stay inside on a snow day may instead choose to do any number of things to stave off boredom, including craft-making, drinking hot chocolate, and baking cookies. Similar Rituals Aside from the Snow Dance, there have been many other rituals and superstitions people have carried out in hopes of snowfall and a possible no school day. Typically, these practices are performed by the younger generation, however all ages may participate. One of the more well-known and popular traditions to wish for snow include wearing one's pajamas inside out when going to bed the night before potential snowfall. This is sometimes also accompanied by wearing the pajamas backwards.\\"Snow-Day Superstition.\\" NPR. NPR, n.d. Web. 01 Dec. 2015. Another superstition is flushing ice cubes down the toilet. Most prefer ice cubes rather than crushed ice. There are many other traditions that include ice cubes such as throwing them into a pond or lake in hopes of the water freezing over, throwing shaved ice cubes at a tree, and tossing ice into one's front yard. Other snow rituals include walking backwards to bed, placing a snowball or a white crayon in the freezer, leaving a spoon under one's pillow while sleeping, running around the kitchen table five times, and chanting ‚ÄúI want it to snow‚Äù three times in a row. All of these superstitions are to help influence the temperature to drop and for snow to fall.\\"How to Get a Day Off? Try a Snow Ritual.\\" Msnbc.com. N.p., 04 Jan. 2006. Web. 01 Dec. 2015. As opposed to other weather rituals alt=Examples of traditional tribal moccasins The Snow Dance, which is meant to summon snow, contrasts the Native American tradition of ushering in rain through what is called the rain dance. Although the Snow Dance is typically performed to invite a type of weather appreciated mainly for its beauty and the fun to be had in it, the success and failure of the rain dance is a matter of survival. Due to prolonged periods of drought in the southwestern United States, the tradition formed as an appeal to nature to send rain, enabling a plentiful harvest. Tribes known to do the rain dance include the Pueblo, Navajo, Hopi, and Mojave. The dance continues to be performed on many reservations in the United States. Unique features of the rain dance include the participation of both men and women in the choreography, the outfits worn by the dancers, and the lack of drum accompaniment. White feathered masks worn by the men represent wind to blow in the rain, while the blue color of turquoise jewels and moccasins symbolize rain. Women do not wear shoes, but other than that are completely covered in ritual clothing. Rhythm for the dance is kept solely by the sound of feet pounding the ground as the dance is performed. Other cultural groups, past and present, also perform or have performed weather rituals. For example, the blood sacrifice poured over the statue of Tezcatlipoca, the sun god of the ancient Aztecs, was believed to be the source of the god's strength to cause the sun to rise each morning. The ancient Inca Empire, prone to volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and floods due to its location in the Andes mountains, also presented sacrifices. These sacrifices, meant to appease the gods, included the sacrifice of children and of prisoners of war. Unlike the rain dance or blood sacrifice, however, these rites were performed in response to calamity rather than to usher in a specific weather pattern.

Reported Snow Dance success In January 2012, members of the Southern Ute Indian tribe met at Vail Village, in Vail, Colorado, with the hopes of bringing more snow to the nearby mountain. While the members of the tribe began their snow dance ritual, hundreds of people gathered to observe. It was reported that, as the ritual progressed, the snowfall increased. According to the Vail Mountain Marketing Director, the Southern Ute Indian Tribe had also performed a snow dance when the mountain originally opened during 1962. The success of the first snow dance ritual resulted in the second call on the tribe years later. Similarly, in 2014, a snow dance ritual was performed at the Sugar Pine State Park in Lake Tahoe by the Eagle Wings Native American dancers. According to the executive director of the Sierra State Parks Foundation, snow began to fall, unexpectedly, only a brief period after the ritual dance was performed.

Known for her research in colloidal chemistry. She lived in Russia until after World War II and then moved to Latvia for the remainder of her life. As a student, she helped create the first Russian gas mask and later published her theories about gas adsorption. She received many awards for her research contributions including induction into the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic Academy of Sciences, the Medal For Valiant Labor in the Great Patriotic War, Order of the Red Banner of Labor, Hero of Socialist Labor, the Order of Lenin and the \\"Hammer and Sickle\\" gold medal. Liepi≈Üa's research interests were diverse, encompassing several different areas of physical chemistry and colloidal chemistry. She investigated colloids' effects on corrosion, absorption in solids, dispersion, formation of hydrides, and surface reactions. Biography Liepi≈Üa was born on 4 April (March 22 O.S.) 1891, in Saint Petersburg, Russia to a Latvian father, KƒÅrlis Liepi≈Ü≈°, and a Russian mother, Ekaterina A. Shelkovskaya. Her father, who was a forester, worked on the estate of Prince Golitsyn and she was raised in both Russia and Latvia. She attended a private girls' school and then graduated from the L.F. Rzhevskoy Women's Gymnasium in 1908, earning a gold medal for her academic excellence. Because women were forbidden to enter university, Liepi≈Üa was required to take private classes to be certified as a home tutor. She completed her studies in 1909 and was certified to tutor language arts, mathematics and both French and Russian languages. With this certificate, she was allowed to continue her studies, if her father gave permission, but she was torn between chemistry and music. Her father granted her permission to study both at the natural history department of the and to enroll in the Moscow Conservatory of Music. For a few years, she studied both before finally choosing chemistry over music, though she was a skilled pianist. In 1914, she suspended her studies and worked in the mobile chemical laboratory of Professor at the Western Front. The laboratory was in a train boxcar and the task of the team was to test and create a quality gas mask. They tested the masks using various materials including coal gas, chlorine gas, phosgene and various filters which included charcoal and even tobacco. The scientists were credited with creating the first Russian gas mask, though poor-quality prototypes existed before their work. She would later publish her notes on their works around 1919 which she called the \\"theory of dynamic adsorption\\". She returned to school in 1915 and finished her studies in September 1917. Two months later, she took a qualifying examination to allow her to teach and after successfully passing it, began teaching analytical and inorganic chemistry at the National Commercial Institute (NCI). In 1920, Liepi≈Üa also started teaching at the Moscow Higher Technical School as the school's first woman teacher. During this time, she was conducting research with Shilov and published influential papers on electrode potentials and also on the regularity of surface adhesions of gases. Throughout the 1920s, she made several trips to Germany to study in labs there with Nobel Prize winner Fritz Haber, Max Bodenstein, Wolfgang Ostwald and others. In 1930, she left her position with the NCI but continued to teach and research at the Technical School. Liepi≈Üa joined the new Military Academy for Chemical Protection in 1932, where she became head of the colloid chemistry department. In 1934, she was made a full professor, the first woman to be awarded a professorship and in 1937, she was awarded a doctorate from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, one of the first in the country awarded in chemistry to a woman. In 1941, Liepi≈Üa left the Chemical Academy and went to work at the University of Moscow. Though it was officially evacuated in the summer of 1941 due to World War II, classes were still held and those who had not left were expected to work in the unheated buildings. Liepi≈Üa remained in Moscow and served as Head of General Chemistry until 1943, for which she was later awarded the Medal For Valiant Labor in the Great Patriotic War. In 1946 she moved to Riga accepting the position of professor in the department of physical chemistry at the University of Latvia. By the early 1950s, she had published over 60 scientific papers and in 1951 she was elected as an academician of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic Academy of Sciences. She remained at the University of Latvia until 1958, when a Chair was created for her in physical chemistry at the Riga Polytechnic Institute. In 1960, Liepi≈Üa was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor and then in 1962, she was honored by the Supreme Council of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic. In 1965, she was granted the title Hero of Socialist Labor, the Order of Lenin and the \\"Hammer and Sickle\\" gold medal. By the end of her career, she had written, or co-written over 210 scientific papers and was awarded a special diploma in 1971 from the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Education. Liepi≈Üa died on 4 September 1985 in Riga, Latvia and was buried in the First Forest Cemetery of Riga after a state funeral which was attended by senior officers of the Soviet Armed Forces and scientists.

A circumstellar disc (or circumstellar disk) is a torus, pancake or ring-shaped accumulation of matter composed of gas, dust, planetesimals, asteroids, or collision fragments in orbit around a star. Around the youngest stars, they are the reservoirs of material out of which planets may form. Around mature stars, they indicate that planetesimal formation has taken place, and around white dwarfs, they indicate that planetary material survived the whole of stellar evolution. Such a disc can manifest itself in various ways. Young star The star SAO 206462 has an unusual circumstellar disc According to the widely accepted model of star formation, sometimes referred to as the nebular hypothesis, a young star (protostar) is formed by the gravitational collapse of a pocket of matter within a giant molecular cloud. The infalling material possesses some amount of angular momentum, which results in the formation of a gaseous protoplanetary disc around the young, rotating star. The former is a rotating circumstellar disc of dense gas and dust that continues to feed the central star. It may contain a few percent of the mass of the central star, mainly in the form of gas which is itself mainly hydrogen. The main accretion phase lasts a few million years, with accretion rates typically between 10‚àí7 and 10‚àí9 solar masses per year (rates for typical systems presented in Hartmann et al.). The disc gradually cools in what is known as the T Tauri star stage. Within this disc, the formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ices can occur, and these can coagulate into planetesimals. If the disc is sufficiently massive, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the appearance of planetary embryos. The formation of planetary systems is thought to be a natural result of star formation. A sun-like star usually takes around 100 million years to form. Around the Solar System Artist's impression of a transitional disc around a young star. * Asteroid belt is a reservoir of small bodies in the Solar System located between the orbit of Mars and Jupiter. It is a source of interplanetary dust. * Edgeworth-Kuiper belt, beyond the orbit of Neptune * Scattered disc, beyond the orbit of Neptune * Hills cloud; only the inner Oort cloud has a toroid-like shape. The outer Oort cloud is more spherical in shape, making it a circumstellar envelope. Binary system The circumbinary disk around AK Scorpii, a young system in the constellation Scoprius. The image of the disk was taken with ALMA. The infall of gas onto a binary system allows the formation of circumstellar and circumbinary discs. The formation of such a disc will occur for any binary system in which infalling gas contains some degree of angular momentum. A general progression of disc formation is observed with increasing levels of angular momentum: * Circumprimary disc is one which orbits the primary (i.e. more massive) star of the binary system. This type of disc will form through accretion if any angular momentum is present in the infalling gas. * Circumsecondary disc is one which orbits around the secondary (i.e. less massive) star of the binary star system. This type of disc will only form when a high enough level of angular momentum is present within the infalling gas. The amount of angular momentum required is dependent on the secondary-to- primary mass ratio. * Circumbinary disc is one which orbits about both the primary and secondary stars. Such a disc will form at a later time than the circumprimary and circumsecondary discs, with an inner radius much larger than the orbital radius of the binary system. A circumbinary disc may form with an upper mass limit of approximately 0.005 solar masses, at which point the binary system is generally unable to perturb the disc strongly enough for gas to be further accreted onto the circumprimary and circumsecondary discs. An example of a circumbinary disc may be seen around the star system GG Tauri. Once a circumstellar disc has formed, spiral density waves are created within the circumstellar material via a differential torque due to the binary's gravity. The majority of these discs form axissymmetric to the binary plane, but it is possible for processes such as the Bardeen-Petterson effect, a misaligned dipole magnetic field and radiation pressure to produce a significant warp or tilt to an initially flat disc. Strong evidence of tilted discs is seen in the systems Her X-1, SMC X-1, and SS 433 (among others), where a periodic line-of-sight blockage of X-ray emissions is seen on the order of 50‚Äì200 days; much slower than the systems' binary orbit of ~1 day. The periodic blockage is believed to result from precession of a circumprimary or circumbinary disc, which normally occurs retrograde to the binary orbit as a result of the same differential torque which creates spiral density waves in an axissymmetric disc. Evidence of tilted circumbinary discs can be seen through warped geometry within circumstellar discs, precession of protostellar jets, and inclined orbits of circumplanetary objects (as seen in the eclipsing binary TY CrA). For discs orbiting a low secondary-to-primary mass ratio binary, a tilted circumbinary disc will undergo rigid precession with a period on the order of years. For discs around a binary with a mass ratio of one, differential torques will be strong enough to tear the interior of the disc apart into two or more separate, precessing discs. A study from 2020 using ALMA data showed that circumbinary disks around short period binaries are often aligned with the orbit of the binary. Binaries with a period longer than one month showed typically a misalignment of the disk with the binary orbit. Dust Primordial cloud of gas and dust surrounding the young star HD 163296. * Debris discs consist of planetesimals along with fine dust and small amounts of gas generated through their collisions and evaporation. The original gas and small dust particles have been dispersed or accumulated into planets. * Zodiacal cloud or interplanetary dust is the material in the Solar System created by collisions of asteroids and evaporation of comet seen to observers on Earth as a band of scattered light along the ecliptic before sunrise or after sunset. * Exozodiacal dust is dust around another star than the Sun in a location analogous to that of the Zodiacal Light in the Solar System.  Stages  Protoplanetary disk AS 209. Stages in circumstellar discs refer to the structure and the main composition of the disc at different times during its evolution. Stages include the phases when the disc is composed mainly of submicron-sized particles, the evolution of these particles into grains and larger objects, the agglomeration of larger objects into planetesimals, and the growth and orbital evolution of planetesimals into the planetary systems, like our Solar System or many other stars. Major stages of evolution of circumstellar discs: * Protoplanetary discs: In this stage large quantities of primordial material (e.g., gas and dust) are present and the discs are massive enough to have potential to be planet-forming. * Transition discs: At this stage, the disc shows significative reduction in the presence of gas and dust and presents properties between protoplanetary and debris discs. * Debris discs: In this stage the circumstellar disc is a tenuous dust disc, presenting small gas amounts or even no gas at all. It is characterized by having dust lifetimes smaller than the age of the disc, hence indicating that the disc is second generation rather than primordial. Disc dissipation and evolution V1247 Orionis is a young, hot star surrounded by a dynamic ring of gas and dust. Material dissipation is one of the processes responsible for circumstellar discs evolution. Together with information about the mass of the central star, observation of material dissipation at different stages of a circumstellar disc can be used to determine the timescales involved in its evolution. For example, observations of the dissipation process in transition discs (discs with large inner holes) estimate the average age of a circumstellar disc to be approximately 10 Myr. Dissipation process and its duration in each stage is not well understood. Several mechanisms, with different predictions for discs' observed properties, have been proposed to explain dispersion in circumstellar discs. Mechanisms like decreasing dust opacity due to grain growth, photoevaporation of material by X-ray or UV photons from the central star (stellar wind), or the dynamical influence of a giant planet forming within the disc are some of the processes that have been proposed to explain dissipation. Dissipation is a process that occurs continuously in circumstellar discs throughout the lifetime of the central star, and at the same time, for the same stage, is a process that is present in different parts of the disc. Dissipation can be divided in inner disc dissipation, mid-disc dissipation, and outer disc dissipation, depending on the part of the disc considered. Inner disc dissipation occurs at the inner part of the disc (< 0.05 ‚Äì 0.1 AU). Since it is closest to the star, this region is also the hottest, thus material present there typically emits radiation in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Study of the radiation emitted by the very hot dust present in that part of the disc indicates that there is an empirical connection between accretion from a disc onto the star and ejections in an outflow. Mid-disc dissipation, occurs at the mid-disc region (1-5 AU) and is characterized for the presence of much more cooler material than in the inner part of the disc. Consequently, radiation emitted from this region has greater wavelength, indeed in the mid-infrared region, which makes it very difficult to detect and to predict the timescale of this region's dissipation. Studies made to determine the dissipation timescale in this region provide a wide range of values, predicting timescales from less than 10 up to 100 Myr. Outer disc dissipation occurs in regions between 50 ‚Äì 100 AU, where temperatures are much lower and emitted radiation wavelength increases to the millimeter region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Mean dust masses for this region has been reported to be ~ 10‚àí5 Solar masses. Studies of older debris discs (107  109 yr) suggest dust masses as low as 10‚àí8 Solar masses, implying that diffusion in outer discs occurs on a very long timescale. As mentioned, circumstellar discs are not equilibrium objects, but instead are constantly evolving. The evolution of the surface density \\\\Sigma of the disc, which is the amount of mass per unit area so after the volume density at a particular location in the disc has been integrated over the vertical structure, is given by: \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Sigma}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{3}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r} \\\\left[ r^{1/2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r} u \\\\Sigma r^{1/2} \\\\right] where r is the radial location in the disc and u is the viscosity at location r. This equation assumes axisymmetric symmetry in the disc, but is compatible with any vertical disc structure. Viscosity in the disc, whether molecular, turbulent or other, transports angular momentum outwards in the disc and most of the mass inwards, eventually accreting onto the central object. The mass accretion onto the star \\\\dot{M} in terms of the disc viscosity u is expressed: \\\\dot{M} = 3 \\\\pi u \\\\Sigma \\\\left[ 1 - \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{r_\\\\text{in}}{r}} \\\\right]^{-1} where r_\\\\text{in} is the inner radius.

Monroe Creek joins Tunkhannock Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Monroe Creek is not designated as an impaired waterbody. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Monroe Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The surficial geology near the mouth of Monroe Creek mainly consists of alluvium and alluvial terrace. Further upstream, it consists of alluvium and a till known as Wisconsinan Till, although bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale occurs in the surficial geology on some nearby hills. Further upstream, the surficial geology is fairly similar, but there is a patch of alluvial fan and a wetland near the creek just north of the Susquehanna County line. In the creek's upper reaches, the surficial geology consists of Wisconsinan Till, except for a wetland at the headwaters. Watershed The watershed of Monroe Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Factoryville. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Hop Bottom. The creek's mouth is located at Starkville. The designated use for Monroe Creek is aquatic life. In 2006, the creek was a proposed flood debris cleanup site. History Monroe Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1192954. The creek is also known as Bartholomew Creek. This variant name appears in Israel C. White's 1883 book The geology of the North Branch Susquehanna River Region in the six counties of Wyoming, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Columbia, Montour and Northumberland. A concrete tee beam bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 92 over Monroe Creek was built in Nicholson Township, Wyoming County in 1931 and is long. This bridge is structurally deficient, as of 2013. Biology The drainage basin of Monroe Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery.

This network, known as CyberaNet, connects Alberta's research universities, colleges, K-12 schools, not-for- profits, and business incubators to one another and to the global grid of research and education networks using optical fibre. Cybera is funded by grants and its membership. The head office is located in the University of Calgary Research Park, with an additional office in downtown Edmonton.  History  Cybera has roots in a 1980s movement to build high-speed data- transfer networks to support university research. The initial manifestation of this movement in Alberta was the Western Universities Research Consortium Network (WURCNet). By the mid 1990s, Canada's western provinces each evolved a need for their own organizations. Alberta created Netera Alliance, while other western provinces created partner network organizations. In 2006, Netera Alliance expanded its mandate and changed its name to Cybera.  Overview  Cybera is a not-for-profit corporation governed by a Board of Directors which includes representatives from the fields of education, research, government, and industry. With offices in Calgary and Edmonton, Cybera maintains indefeasible rights of use on network links for research and education purposes in the province of Alberta.

Career  Yamada started his artistic career by working at Shuji Terayama's theatre company, Tenjousajiki. In 1974, he was appointed as an artistic crew in Terayama's feature-film, Denen ni Shisu (Pastoral: To Die in the Country). He also worked for Boxer (1977), Kusameikyu (Grass Labyrinth, 1979), Saraba Hakobune (Farewell to the Ark, 1982). At the same time in Sapporo, Yamada started a film club, Gingagahou-sha Eiga Club, with his colleague Yumekichi Minatoya in 1977. Ever since his first 8mm film made for the club, Subaru no Yoru (An Incident of Night) was selected for Pia Film Festival, he has been constantly working with 8mm films (occasionally 16mm). Most of them are short 'private films' and named by himself ‚ÄòYamavicascope‚Äô. Since 1991, La Camera in Tokyo has produced regular duo-screenings of his films and the works by Yamazaki Mikio. In the filmography of Yamavicascope, the film-correspondences between Yamada and Yamazaki are titled as OUFUKU (Film Letter) I~V (1986~2006). In addition to screenings in Japan, Yamada's experimental art works have been featured at Cannes, Oberhausen, Stockholm and other film festivals. His feature-films are Anmonaito no sasayaki wo kiita (I‚Äôve heard the ammonite‚Äôs murmur:1992), Jouhatsu Tabinikki (The Soul Odyssey: 2003) based on the essay by Yoshiharu Tsuge, and Shutorumu unto Doranku (Sturm und Drang: 2014). In addition to the cinema work, Yamada works with the media of manga, painting and graphic design.

Ranching Jackson, briefly a banker, was interested in agriculture and became a rancher when he journeyed west and bought the Alisal ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley at auction in 1943. He built it up as a guest ranch, opening to the public in 1946. For a period of time the ranch was known for attracting celebrity visitors; Clark Gable married Lady Sylvia Ashley there in 1949. Under the management of his son it became more popular as a family destination. Equestrian interests Jackson was a co-founder of the Santa Barbara Riding and Hunt Club, in the suburb of Hope Ranch, alongside Amy DuPont, Charles E. Jenkins, Harold S. Chase, Dwight Murphy, C.K.G. Billings, John Mitchell, George Owen Knapp, Peter Cooper Bryce, Col. G. Watson French and F.W. Leadbetter in the 1920s. He acquired 25 polo ponies from Argentina in 1933. Personal life Jackson married (Marcia) Ann Gavit on September 7, 1926 at Santa Barbara, California. She was an heiress to the Anthony N. Brady fortune, and was described at the time as \\"Albany's wealthiest girl\\" and \\"one of the wealthiest heiresses in America\\". They resided in Rancho San Carlos in Montecito, California, a estate near Santa Barbara. In 1958, they acquired part of the old Hammond estate, which was divided up between Wiliam G. Gilmore of Atherton, the President of Gilmore Steel; L.C. Smith, a contractor from San Francisco; and the Jacksons. Some of the old Hammond estate later became Shalawa Meadow, California. Death and legacy Jackson died in 1978. His widow died in 1990. Their Rancho San Carlos was inherited by his grandson, Jim Jackson, who listed it for US$125 million in 2014.

In 2015 Bramall finished in silver medal position in the T33 100m sprint event at the IPC World Championships in Doha. Personal history Bramall was born in 1985 and grew up in Minshull Vernon in the north west of England. Bramall has cerebral palsy which affects his lower limbs. Career history Bramall was introduced to athletics and wheelchair racing by a friend and subsequently joined Stockport Harriers and Athletics Club. In 2012 he was classified as a T33 athlete and took part in his first meets that year. Bramall focused primarily on the sprint events and in his first season recorded a best of 23.59 in the T33 100m. The next season Bramall began posting championship times in his three main events. He brought his personal best in the 100m down to 18.88, his 200m time from 44.34 to 35.17 and reduced his 400m to 68.89 an improvement of over 20 seconds. In 2014 Bramall entered his first IPC Grand Prix, travelling to Nottwil in Switzerland. There he finished third in the 100m, with a personal best of 18.69 and another third spot finish in the 200m. The following year Bramall joined the Great Britain team to compete at the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha. At the World Championships Bramall only contested the 100m as there was no 200m competition. Bramall finished second behind Kuwait's Ahmad Almutairi to win his first major international medal. The next year, in the build up to the Summer Paralympics in Rio, Bramall travelled to Grosseto to compete in the 2016 IPC Athletics European Championships. There was only one T33 event at the championship, the 100m sprint, and in a limited field Bramall took the silver medal behind British team-mate Toby Gold. In July 2016 Bramall was confirmed as a member of the Great Britain team to compete at the Rio Paralympics.

Public rhetoric can also involve rhetoric being used within the general populace to foster social change and encourage agency on behalf of the participants of public rhetoric. The collective discourse between rhetoricians and the general populace is one representation of public rhetoric. A new discussion within the field of public rhetoric is digital space because the growing digital realm complicates the idea of private and public, as well as previously concrete definitions of discourse. Furthermore, scholars of public rhetoric often employ the language of tourism to examine how identity is negotiated between individuals and groups and how this negotiation impacts individuals and groups on a variety of levels, ranging from the local to the global.  Public rhetoric participants  A public, not to be confused with the public, is composed of members that address each other, are addressed as a group, and also subscribe to specific ideals. Michael Warner describes a public as \\"being self-organized, ‚Ä¶a relationship among strangers ‚Ä¶[where] merely paying attention can be enough to make [one] a member.\\" Robert Asen notes that identity formation of members of a public \\"entails mutual recognition among members of diverse cultures.\\" To Warner, publics are a social space where information is exchanged and is required for the exchange of information.  Counterpublics  Within the public sphere, dominant publics exist whose discourse can subordinate other publics or exclude them from a related discourse. Counterpublics are the result of discourse and/or people feeling marginalized, ignored, inadequately voiced, or silenced within the public sphere. \\"Counterpublic refers to those publics that form through mutual recognition of exclusions in wider publics, set themselves against exclusionary wider publics, and resolve to overcome these exclusions,\\" writes Asen. Where dominant public groups typically manufacture heteronormative public spaces and discourse, counterpublics seek to insert or reinsert voices and perspectives of and from publics. Discourse then abnormalizes or even challenges dominant public rhetoric. Warner describes the facilities of counterpublic using the LGBTQ+ community: As Asen furthers, \\"Individuals do not necessarily recognize exclusions and resolve to overcome them by virtue of their location in a social order.\\" Asen maintains that claiming a counterpublic of this form can diminish counterpublic forms to particular contributors who share specific interests with other members but might not consider each other as allies.  Subaltern and bourgeois groups  Amid publics and counterpublics, prevailing ideology, discourse, and images can create a hierarchy of group members and the rhetoric thereof. The struggle for political and social power within the public sphere between publics gives rise to dominant and weaker internal publics within a public, namely subaltern and bourgeois publics, respectively. For example, in their article \\"Graffiti Hurts in the United States,\\" Terri Moreau and Derek H. Alderman describe an anti-graffiti task force, Graffiti Hurts, advocating for the eradication of urban graffiti in public spaces. This organization funded mural projects that would serve as a deterrent for would-be graffitists. While graffiti is often considered a lesser art form compared to the classical arts such as music, canvas painting, and sculpture, the mural projects \\"actually work to carry out a 'normative' prescription of landscape. The normalization has the ability to eradicate the potential for alternative constructions of public expression. As [Kurt] Iveson observes, 'A legal mural might have some effect in making ... people's culture more visible in public space, but often this is on someone else's' terms.'\\" Keith Herring argues that the dominant images of a gay counterpublic produce \\"clones\\" representing \\"well-built,\\" effeminate, white males. While whiteness is idealized, racial minority imagery and representation was and remains marginalized. A bourgeois subgroup within a public is primarily composed of \\"private individuals‚Ä¶[that] do not 'rule'.... Instead, their ideas infiltrated the very principle on which the existing power is based.\\" The bourgeois within a public represent a prevailing definition of the relevant publics and thereby control a greater degree of shared space for the related discourse between the larger public membership.  Strangers  Strangers are those who are not aware of their membership within a particular public. They are capable of being members of a public; however, they can also hold no opinion or in other ways pay no attention to their potential membership to a public. Strangers are normally not those who ignore their membership (which implies one is aware of being a member of a public). To Warner, without the presence of strangers in a public sphere, public discourse cannot occur because it is a requirement for public discourse to address strangers and provide them the awareness to identify themselves as an addressed public.  Orientation  Public rhetoric participants produce discourse relative to a larger conglomerate of people or publics. Within the public sphere, different publics engage their own or other publics in conversation creating discourse that affects their own and other groups through definition of public boundaries, redefining public structure, and dispersing related public ideology. For a person to produce public rhetoric, one would self-identify with a public. Media, culture, and geography are the more predominant orienting processes that channel people towards and away from specific publics. Through public rhetoric, publics can recruit strangers and embed or polarize members of the same or other publics. Political propaganda and product advertisement are two concrete examples of forces that orient strangers and publics through analog and digital media. When people engage in public discourse, \\"describ[ing] themselves and others, they do not engage in a value-neutral and transparent process. Rather, representational processes implicate participants in (often unacknowledged) choices regarding how people should be portrayed\\". As one begins to form judgments regarding the image of a public, of a particular ideology, or of the protocols governing inclusion and exclusion in public discourse, that person then gains membership within a relevant public, thus becoming, in part, a representation of the whole image of said public. How one is introduced to a public varies as existing knowledge and experience can augment how one perceives a public and public rhetoric. Tony Hiss points out how places can orient and disorient civilians. In his discussion, Hiss describes public parks as having the function of \\"changing the way we look at things, diffusing our attention and also relaxing its intensity‚Ä¶\\". The geography of the park often contrasts the image of the city in which it exists. Effective entrance design for parks encourage visitors to enter, displacing prior experience in exchange for \\"park experience\\", in a transition that navigates the visitors smoothly to and from the park experience. Similarly, when strangers are introduced to public discourse, orientation processes enable strangers to adopt and displace specific images of a public and evoke their membership to the new public.  Rhetoric for public use  According to David J. Coogan and John M. Ackerman, \\"rhetoric is in the midst of discovering anew its usefulness.\\" As service learning and civic engagement increase at colleges and universities, rhetoric begins the process of regrouping and becoming relevant in the community outside of the academy. In both the field of English and of communication, rhetoric's reputation needs to be repaired and adapted to meet the needs of the general populace. In general, the public view of rhetoric is a negative one. It is the talk of politicians‚Äîfilled with lies and manipulation. Instead, the public work of rhetoric should try to lead to social change. Scholars such as Ellen Cushman and Cynthia Sheard demonstrate this belief in their work; these and other scholars believe that rhetoricians should use their tools for the good of the public. In order to make this shift in rhetoric's reputation, rhetoric needs a new set of guidelines by which to prepare rhetoricians to participate in social action.  Rhetoric in praxis as social action  Because rhetoric and composition are so closely related, the composition classroom becomes an open space for fostering social activism through service learning and allowing students to develop a sense of agency for both their scholarship and their interactions with the public. Ellen Cushman tells readers in her article \\"The Rhetorician as an Agent of Social Change\\" that \\"one way to increase our participation in public discourse is to bridge the university and community through activism. Given the role rhetoricians have historically played in the politics of their communities, [Cushman believes] modern rhetoric and composition scholars can be agents of social change outside the university.\\" Through their respective institutions, Cushman argues that both young and old scholars of rhetoric and composition can use their educational expertise to connect with the public outside of the university that, as scholars, they are typically estranged from. Because universities are often situated as counterpublics within the overall public of the geographic area in which they are located, it appears that scholars often feel prohibited from approaching and participating in the outside community. In order to negate this feeling of being restricted from community engagement, Cushman urges members of the rhetoric and composition community at universities to participate in service learning.  Reciprocity from practicing rhetoric in public spaces  In an attempt to bridge the gap between the university and the community, Cushman suggests ways to \\"empower people in our communities, establish networks of reciprocity with them, and create solidarity with them.\\" In order to invent this network of reciprocity, Cushman urges rhetoricians and students within the university to venture outside of the boundaries of the institution, foster relationships with members of the community, and to perform work that benefits the community. Hopefully the scholar perceives a kairotic moment in which they come to an understanding of the relationship between the community and public rhetoric and are then, in turn, able to write and publish on their work. In essence, \\"[Cushman is] asking for a deeper consideration of the civic purpose of our positions in the academy, of what we do with our knowledge, for whom, and by what means.\\" Aside from the reciprocity that inherently comes from performing social activism within the general community, engaging with those outside of academe allows scholars to improve the public's general conception of rhetoric, thereby increasing the field's ethos in the eyes of the general public.  Reforming the public's view of rhetoric  While the general populace currently views \\"doing rhetoric\\" as \\"menacing our fellow citizens with lies and misdirection,\\" these devices have the ability to allow rhetoricians and social activists alike to bring about social change and repair rhetoric's reputation in the eyes of the general populace. For example, in Cynthia Sheard's article, \\"The Public Value of Epideictic Rhetoric,\\" she discusses how epideictic rhetoric, which has traditionally elicited a negative public opinion, can be used to foster social change. Sheard calls rhetoricians to embrace a process of \\"[r]econceptualizing epideictic in order to emphasize ... [i]ts close connection to the public sphere and its visionary quality ... \\" Sheard continues to explain that \\"epideictic discourse alters the reality in which it participates by making its vision a reality for its audience and instilling a belief that the power for realizing the vision lies with them.\\" According to Sheard, this ability to alter the audience's perception of reality, an ability that epideictic rhetoric was once criticized for, is exactly what gives this device the power to involve the general populace in social activism and persuade them to view rhetoric in a positive light instead of describing it as a manipulative device.  Spaces  Spaces are the sites in which public rhetoric happens. These sites are not necessarily physical, geographically bound places, but metaphysical spaces in which discourse is shared and mediated by the members of specific publics.  Places vs. spaces  To understand the spaces in which public rhetoric is enacted, it is important to understand the differences between \\"space\\" and \\"place.\\" In his book The Practice of Everyday Life, Michel de Certeau, defines places as an \\"instantaneous configuration of positions.\\" To Certeau, places are geographically bound, locatable sites. These sites are defined by location and spatial relations to other places. Certeau claims that places are different from spaces because places are \\"ultimately reducible to being there\\" while spaces are specified \\"by the actions of historical subjects.\\" While places could be pointed to on a map and are defined by what is physically inside of them, spaces are sites where things have happened. A space is defined by the interactions that individual agents have with it, not by its physical features. Certeau gives the examples that the place of a street becomes a space only when people walk on it and the places of texts only become spaces when people read them. When people engage in a discourse with a place, when they participate in public rhetoric there, it becomes a space.  Utopias and heterotopias  Michel Foucault built on Certeau's definition of space in his essay, \\"Of Other Spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias,\\" pointing out that spaces were defined by \\"a set of relations that delineates sites which are irreducible to one another and absolutely not superimposable on one another.\\" He argued that these individual, specific spaces could be placed in two main types: utopias and heterotopias. = Utopias = According to Foucault, utopias are spaces with no real place which present society in its perfected form. Since these spaces are not places that exist in reality, but rather as a result of the rhetoric that surrounds them, they are described as fundamentally unreal places. = Heterotopias = Heterotopias are real spaces that exist in every culture. Unlike Utopias, they are places that exist in physical space and can be indicated by their location. Foucault describes these heterotopias as \\"effectively enacted utopias in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted.\\" These heterotopic spaces transcend a single place as their value comes from the interactions that take place inside of them, but the fact that they are universally constructed and recognized allows for them to be pointed to geographically. = Middle spaces = Middle-spaces, according to David Coogan, are spaces in which rhetors from different publics can come and have an engaging discourse. As Coogan discusses, these are both physical and ideological places in which agents from two given publics c[an] come together to engage in discourse about \\"the 'codes' to evaluate conduct, entertain political possibilities, and in other ways arrange their affairs.\\" These spaces are especially conducive as places for counterpublics and publics to meet to question the commonplaces or ideological statements. In enacting discourse in middle spaces, counterpublic discourse can be heard and have influence on public discourse.  Tourism as public rhetoric  In discussions of public rhetoric, tourism refers both to the act of traveling to a physical location in search of a transformative experience and to the metaphorical action of traveling into the experiential world of another. Public rhetoric scholars use the language of tourism to examine individuals and communities' relationships to each other.  Identity politics  Scholars of public rhetoric frequently invoke the language of tourism to discuss individual and group identity. This is often done to disrupt notions of individuality. J√ºrgen Habermas, for instance, chronicles the emergence of the concept of the individual in Western society, only to demonstrate the individual's sublimation before the regulating function of the public sphere: \\"With the interweaving of the public and private realm, not only do the political authorities assume certain functions in the sphere of commodity exchange and social labor, but conversely social powers now assume political functions. This leads to a kind of 'refeudalization' of the public sphere.\\" Habermas' concern for the political and social ramifications of individual versus public identity is one shared by other public rhetoric scholars.  Toxic tourism  Whereas the Western conception of the Subject tends to emphasize individual autonomy, scholars of public rhetoric challenge the notion that individual identity exists separately from the surrounding world. This challenge to Enlightenment notions of identity is exemplified by the work of Phaedra Pezzullo. In Toxic Tourism, Pezzullo argues that tourism as practice has the potential to help bridge the divide between Subject and Object by facilitating interaction on a multi-sensory level. Pezzullo suggests that embracing tourism's ability to engage all of the body's senses \\"may help those of us who study tourism to become more reflexive about our own culpability in privileging and, thus, perpetuating oppressive and colonial sensibilities.\\" The language of interconnection and responsibility pervades public rhetoric's concern with tourism as a process that mediates relationships between human beings. Researchers such as Pezzullo have discussed the large extent that notions of toxicity are reflected in the ways that certain groups are marginalized. For instance, Pezzullo writes \\"that the 'toxic baggage' the nation carries exceeds the material impact of toxins and public discourses about them. It includes our cultural perceptions of our bodies and the bodies of 'polluted' and 'polluting' Others.\\" Thus, the language of toxicity is not limited to describing polluted areas or even victims of pollution. Toxicity is used to identify and rhetorically isolate segments of the population that do not conform to the Public's normative expectations. Yet, as Pezzullo also suggests, the practice of tourism allows for travel between the Public and those citizens and groups who stand outside it. Pezzullo suggests that toxic tours, for instance, stand to allow the marginalized and often ignored Other to \\"look back\\" at the tourist who is experiencing the toxic area. The experience of becoming the Object of the Other's gaze raises the possibility that the tourist's perspective on the Other may be altered in the exchange, thus raising the possibility that the practice of tourism can induce transformation in the tourist.  Tourism and publics  Taken in a broad sense, the practice of tourism enables interactions that allow for the formation and maintenance of publics. Tourism as a concept does not merely connote the movement of bodies from one physical place to another; it also refers to the internalization and externalization of ideas. As Michael Warner indicates, the ability to exchange ideas is what enables the participatory creation of the public sphere and is, therefore, a source of great power: \\"Speaking, writing, and thinking involve us-actively and immediately-in a public, and thus in the being of the sovereign. Imagine how powerless people would feel if their commonality and participation were simply defined by pre-given frameworks, by institutions and law, as in other social contexts it is defined through kinship. ... Such is the image of totalitarianism.\\" Examined as an exchange of ideas, the practice of tourism allows individuals to engage in discourse with other individuals, thereby creating publics. Key to Warner and other scholars' understanding of publics is the notion of voluntary participation. The citizen-tourist must willingly encounter the perspectives of other citizens. In this sense, public-creating tourist practices are not limited to \\"the pundits and wonks and reaction-shot secondary celebrities who try to perform our publicness for us ... [, but include] people whose place in public media is one of consuming, witnessing, griping, or gossiping rather than one of full participation, or fame.\\" Warner goes on to state that, \\"a public can only produce a sense of belonging and activity if it is self-organized through discourse rather than through an external framework.\\" Just as the tourist who travels to a different geographic area chooses to do so, a choice that invites the possibility of being transformed by the experience, the citizen-tourist must choose to engage in discourse with other citizens in order for that exchange to create and maintain a public.  Birthplaces of public rhetoric: the street & the riot  In its most organic form, the discourse of the public sphere arises spontaneously. In his seminal work \\"The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article\\" Habermas discusses the bourgeois public as an instrumental development in the history of publics but recognizes the limitations of the bourgeois public for modernity: \\"Although the liberal model of the public sphere is still instructive today with respect to the normative claim that information be accessible to the public, it cannot be applied to the actual conditions of an industrially advanced mass democracy‚Ä¶\\". The size of the modern state limits the ability of the democratic populace to truly engage in a conversation of public rhetoric. Thus, instead of self-regulating, many of the public's demands need to be met by the state, which could not please everyone on such a large scale. When these needs are not met, the scale of the democracy requires a dramatic catalyst to bridge the distance between the citizens and bring to light the need for change. The most basic (albeit violent) form of public would be that of the riot, which is engendered by \\"competitions of interest, competitions which assume the form of violent conflicts.\\" Although this public is less civilized and perfect than is desirable, the spontaneity and power of riots and civil unrest‚Äîwhich Habermas refers to as \\"the street\\"‚Äîoften affect change, as has been demonstrated throughout modern history time and time again. Without any sort of organized formation, the riot embodies the public sphere; the citizenry reacts to an issue with an outburst of the same opinion (one they may not realize they shared) and has thus created a publicly driven rhetorical discourse surrounding the issue. The riot is organic; often considered barbaric or savage because of the raw emotions involved. Cynthia Sheard claims that it is a result of \\"the ways in which words fail us‚Ä¶ all-too-common images of violence must make us wonder, indeed, whether words can make any difference in our lives.\\" Although the riot may have devastating consequences, it is purposeful in its ability to create recognition of a problem across a nation, bridging the gaps of class and distance the issue may otherwise find insurmountable. For example, the Black Lives Matter movement is now global due to the riots following the kairotic police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO. Many of those who have never before been affected by police violence towards black males have now seen the movement \\"in their own backyards,\\" and protests have arisen across the country, while both the mainstream and social media coverage of Ferguson has enabled this issue to be prescient in the minds of many far-removed citizens.  Digital public  A digital public can be considered as a few different entities. According to Patricia G. Lange, a digital space is a social network, or a group of people related to each other in some way. Digital social networks in which knowledge is communicated and shared have been labeled \\"epistemopolis.\\" An epistemopolis facilitates the growth of communities in a specific space around a specific topic. These digital social spaces are complicated by the possibility of anyone in the world being related to anyone else in the world in any given way at any given time; measurements or regulations or requirements for defining a specific digital space would need to be applied on an individual basis. While this isn't necessarily up for debate in fields that study digital realms, it does present challenges for public rhetoric because it provides a more complex, tangled conception of a public. A digital space can take any of a variety of forms: chat rooms, social media networks, blogs, private journals, news sites, question and answer forums, professional marketing pages, online shopping sites, etc. Additionally, digital space allows for cultural interaction in a way that is not possible in analog device spaces. It is important to note that the internet is a social construction, designed for social interaction among various contexts (including economic, discursive, etc.). To this end, digital spaces can be manipulated, adapted, or even created for different, specific functions. Consider Wikipedia: \\"the free encyclopedia anyone can edit.\\" This site encourages individuals to share more information, making verified knowledge public and collaborative. Another example is Douglas Eyman's text Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice. Eyman wrote a print and a digital version of this text and includes a statement encouraging readers to take, revise, reuse, and circulate his original text, which is why he made the book available for free online.  Public rhetoric in the digital realm  The digital sphere presents a new set of challenges for public rhetoric. With issues of authorship, autonomy, and anonymity, the field crosses back and forth constantly between private and public. Individuals can create a digital persona, an avatar, while keeping their actual identity a secret. It is relatively easy to steal content and present it as your own (leading to copyright and plagiarism issues). To a certain extent, \\"technology has fused with human consciousness itself,\\" resulting in a collective, shared, public memory. Many people may oppose or feel threatened by advancements in technology, especially the internet. Some question personal and financial safety, a fear that may be heard as part of the argument opposing use of digital spaces. Opportunities for extended communication, in a plethora of different ways, litter the argument for development of digital spaces and tools. For example, digital social activism (also referred to as internet activism or cyberactivism) is a growing movement that uses digital spaces to spread awareness and encourage action regarding various topics. Analog spaces tend to allow for a smaller audience than digital spaces, and therefore (typically) results in less action. Digital rhetoric is important to consider when thinking about digital publics. Individuals create online identities, influencing how a digital audience can be addressed. This in turn influences how the author uses the rhetorical canons in their composition.  The photographic image as an icon  Photographic images can function in public rhetoric as icons of U.S. public culture. According to Robert Hariman and John Louis Lucaites in No Caption Needed: Iconic Photographs, Public Culture, and Liberal Democracy, iconic images \\"work in several registers of ritual and response.\\" Public interpretations and influences of iconic photographic images manifest themselves as visual representations, or delivery of rhetoric. How these images function in public depends on the features of the specific image, the motivation for the image, and the responses from the public sphere.  What makes an icon an icon?  While multiple interpretations of photographic images as icons are discussed in conversations of public rhetoric, establishing what makes an icon an icon is important in order to identify and further analyze icons' functions. Hariman and Lucaites describe the seven characteristics of an icon as follows: # is easily recognized by many people of varied backgrounds; # is an object of veneration and other complex emotional responses; # is reproduced widely and placed prominently in both public and private settings; # is used to orient the individual [viewer] within a context of collective identity, obligation, and power; # represents large swaths of historical experience and acquires its own history of appropriation and commentary; # stands above the welter of news, debates, decisions, and investigations; and/or # bears witness to something that exceeds words. If a photographic image holds one or more of the above- mentioned characteristics, it is considered an icon and fulfills several important functions in public rhetoric.  Functions of photographic icons in public life  As a version of public rhetoric, iconic images serve to compose meaning and persuade a public audience to respond in some way. According to Hariman and Lucaites, \\"each image presents a pattern of motivation that can make some responses more likely than others.\\" An iconic image semiotically promotes an interpretation by its audience that is by no means incumbent on the specific image, but likely will create a realm of similar meanings more frequently than others. Five vectors of influence are identified for iconic photographs: \\"reproducing ideology, communicating social knowledge, shaping collective memory, modeling citizenship, and providing figural resources for communicative action.\\" = Reproducing ideology = Iconic images have the capability of representing ideology, which Hariman and Lucaites define as \\"a set of beliefs that presents a social order as if it were a natural order, that presents asymmetrical relationships as if they were mutually beneficial, and that makes authority appear self-evident.\\" A photograph has the power to create such public meaning that can manipulate order, relationships, and authority as part of reproducing ideology. = Communicating social knowledge = Because icons are distinctively public visual images, they \\"recast social knowledge with regard to the distinctive concerns and roles of public life.\\" By tapping into the knowledge of the public to which they are being presented, icons effectively persuade members of a society and their social interactions, as any successful rhetoric does. Photographs can communicate social knowledge because they are accepted as representations of social performance. = Shaping collective memory = Photographic icons can negotiate collective memory as part of the social knowledge it communicates. An icon can shape public understanding of specific events and contexts at the kairotic time of their occurrence and thereafter. Thus, society as a whole acts as the audience of the rhetorical message sent about the time the photograph was taken. Hariman and Lucaites contend, \\"the more collective memory is constructed through the visual media, the more likely it is that the iconic photos will be used to mark, frame, and otherwise set the tone for later generations' understanding of public life\\" in the specific time period. = Modeling citizenship = Members of the public interpreting iconic images can themselves be shaped by the messages sent by the icons, as can their rhizomatic relationships with each other. When viewing icons that portray U.S. citizens, the audience sees themselves in those citizens and emulates their portrayal of society. Iconic images essentially \\"display the public to themselves.\\" = Providing figural resources for communicative action = Since society can be considered \\"abstract\\" in terms of relationships between citizens, photographs serve to communicate such ambiguous citizenship and supply models for how to be a \\"good citizen.\\" Hariman and Lucaites explain that \\"an iconic photograph can continue to shape public understanding and action long after the event has passed or the crisis has been resolved pragmatically.\\" The collective memory formed by iconic photographs inspire action to perform as a moral citizen and motivate public response.

It is part of the second fortified belt of forts of Metz and had its baptism of fire in late 1944, when the Battle of Metz occurred.  Historical context  During the annexation, Metz was a German garrison of between 15,000 and 20,000 men at the beginning of the periodRen√© Bour, Histoire de Metz, 1950, p. 227. and exceeded 25,000 men just before the First World War,Philippe Martin, L'Express, no. 2937, 18‚Äì24 October 2007, Metz en 1900. gradually becoming the first stronghold of the German Reich.Fran√ßois Roth: Metz annex√©e √† l'Empire allemand, in Fran√ßois-Yves Le Moigne, Histoire de Metz, Privat, Toulouse, 1986, p. 350. The ' completed the Second fortified belt of Metz composed of Festen Wagner (1904‚Äì1912), Crown Prince (1899‚Äì1905), Leipzig (1907‚Äì1912), empress (1899‚Äì1905), Lorraine (1899‚Äì1905), Freiherr von der Goltz (1907‚Äì1916), Haeseler (1899‚Äì1905), Prince Regent Luitpold (1907‚Äì1914) and Infantry-Werk Belle-Croix (1908‚Äì1914).  Overall design  The Group Fortification Francois de Guise was built by Germany in the first annexation. It was part of a wider program of fortifications called \\"Moselstellung\\", which encompassed fortresses scattered between Thionville and Metz in the valley Moselle. The aim of Germany was to protect against a French attack to retake Alsace-Lorraine from the German Empire. The fortification system was designed to accommodate the growing advances in artillery since the end of 20th century. Based on new defensive concepts, such as dispersal and concealment, the fortified group was to be, in case of attack, an impassable barrier for French forces. From 1899, the Schlieffen Plan of the German General Staff designed the fortifications of the Moselstellung, between Metz and Thionville, to be like a lock for blocking any advance of French troops in case of conflict.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870‚Äì1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008, p. 24. This concept of a fortified line on the Moselle was a significant innovation compared to Syst√®me S√©r√© de Rivi√®res developed by the French. It later inspires the engineers of the Maginot Line.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870‚Äì1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008, pp. 10‚Äì13.  Construction and facilities  The Group Fortification Francois de Guise, over an area of 80 hectares, was built from 1907 to 1912. The perimeter defense of the Group Fortification Francois de Guise was provided by two infantry positions, the Folie works and Leipzig works. The three fortified barracks could receive 360 men. The batteries are equipped with rotating turret howitzers 100 mm wide. Scattered on the high points, 6 observation turrets and 12 observation posts allow perfect monitoring of the sector. Each infantry item has a power plant equipped with three diesel 20 hp engines. The works are scattered over a wide area and concealed by the natural topography. All works, connected by 270 m of underground galleries, are surrounded by a network of barbed wire.  Successive assignments  From 1890 the garrison relief was guaranteed by the fort troops Corps XVI stationed at Metz and Thionville. From 1914 to 1918, the fort was spared any fighting, and used simply as outpost by the German army. After 1918, the Group Fortification Francis de Guise was invested by the French army. In 1939, it serves as an outpost for the French army. Taken over by the Germans in June 1940, it served as a training ground. Beginning in September 1944, during the Battle of Metz, German troops reorganized its defense, and integrated it into the defensive system set up around Metz. After World War II, the fort was taken over by the French army. The fortified group comprising forts Leipzig and Madness was used during the Cold War from 1953 to 1958 as part of air defense, having a transmission vocation. This place was then the Work \\"F\\" of the DAT (\\"Radar Station Master 40/921\\").¬´ Antoine Brolli: Volume G of D.A.T. ¬ª in le Bulletin de la soci√©t√© belfortaine d'√©mulation Number 79 / 1987‚Äì1988.

Second World War  After the departure of French troops in June 1940, the German army reinvested the fort. In early September 1944, the Battle of Metz began. The German command integrated the defensive system set up around Metz. On September 2, 1944, Metz was declared, in effect by the Reich, fortress Hitler. The fortress was required to be defended to the last by German troops, whose leaders were all sworn to the F√ºhrerRen√© Caboz, La bataille de Metz, √âditions Pierron, Sarreguemines, 1984, p. 132. The defense is organized around the forts of Metz. From September 6, 1944, the Group Fortification Francis de Guise serves as a forward base on the front line for German units of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division. At that time, German troops are based firmly at the strengths of the sector, especially in the Group Fortification Francois de Guise, ideally located between the Group Fortification Lorraine, or Festivals Lorraine, and the Fort Jeanne d'Arc, or Fixed Empress. In the area of Amanvillers - Saint-Privat is held further north by the 1010th Backup Regiment of Colonel Richter of the 462th Infanterie-Division and further south by the Cadets of the Fahnenjunkerschule VI des Heeres, \\"Metz\\" under the command of Wehrmacht (army)Colonel Joachim von Siegroth. On the morning of September 9, 1944, the American artillery rained shells on identified German positions, paving the way for the infantry and the tanks of Task force McConnell. Arriving in the Wood Jaumont US troops' 2nd Infantry regiment were taken under fire by Fort Kellermann. The German batteries eliminated, within moments, seven tanks and two freestanding guns, forcing the column to withdraw precipitately.Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, pp. 152‚Äì155. Wanting to bypass the fortifications from the north, the Americans were soon under fire from a German counterattack before being stopped by gunfire from Group Fortification Lorraine. The artillery of the US campaign immediately resumed his attacks on the fortifications of the sector, but without great results considering the terrain and vegetation. The 3rd Battalion of the Task force, in charge of the right flank of the attack, fell on the fortified farmhouse of Moscou,At that same place, the French troops of Napoleon III repelled the assault of three German columns, August 18, 1870, at the Battle of Gravelotte. a veritable redoubt between the German fortifications, before being taken under heavy fire from Gravelotte. The 2nd Battalion Task force, which was heading towards Vern√©ville with relative ease, was finally stopped by gunfire from a sunken road, west of Fort Francis de Guise. The day ended with a failure for Colonel Roffe, who regretted high losses‚Äî14 officers and 332 men‚Äîfor \\"twenty odd forts\\". He therefore calls for air support from General Silvester. On September 10, 1944, three squadrons of fighter-bombers dropped their bombs on the eastern sector of Amanvillers, where the fortifications were grouped. The P-47s reach their targets, but the 500-pound bombs have little effect on the reinforced concrete fortifications. The infantry attack was launched at 18:00, meeting fierce resistance. Despite the support of tanks, it stopped three hours later, out of breath. Towards Gravelotte, in the Woods G√©nivaux, American troops also destroyed the Officer Cadets of wehrmacht Colonel Siegroth that dominate the field. On September 10, 1944, the commander of the 7th Armored Division agreed to take a position near Roncourt to support a new attack of the 2nd Infantry regiment. On September 11, 1944, at 6:30 am, the tanks were headed for Pierrevillers, wiping the passage with sporadic gunfire, they finally came across a roadblock, with fire coming from anti-tank guns, which were camouflaged and difficult to locate. The infantry, however, managed to take a position on the wooded slopes, northwest of the village of Bronvaux, too far, however, from the objective, which was to support the 2nd Infantry regiment. Despite several counterattacks by the 462th Infanterie Division, American troops arrive to take over the land in the late afternoon, after a rolling artillery barrage targeting fortifications in the sector, and which uses smoke shells for cover. On September 13, 1944, the US military redeployed its troops on the front line to concentrate its attack on the fortifications. But fatigue and stress disoriented the men of the 2nd Infantry regiment, which were ultimately relieved on September 14. The 1st Battalion Task force, hard hit by the shelling of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division and specific small arms fire, had to withdraw with difficulty behind a screen of smoke rockets, more than five hundred meters from Amanvillers. Around 14:00, an air strike on Amanvillers did not allow the infantry to advance, the village being too close to the fortifications of the sector to be taken in full. Fatigue and stress soon disoriented men of the 2nd Infantry Regiment, who were finally relieved from this \\"Hell Hole ¬ª¬´ Received warning order that we are to be relieved‚Äîwhich is good news, this is sure a hell hole ¬ª (Journal de marche du 3rd bataillon of 2nd Infantry Regiment of 14 September 1944). on September 14, 1944. Two regiments, reinforced by the engineering companies of the 90th Infantry Division, took over in the area: the 357th Infantry Regiment of Colonel Barth took position along the Wood Jaumont, to the east of Saint- Privat-la-Montagne, while the 359th Infantry Regiment of Colonel Bacon took position to the east of Gravelotte.Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 176‚Äì183. On September 15, 1944, an attack was planned on the Canrobert sector of buildings and Kellermann sector to the north and Fort Jeanne d'Arc on the southern sector. The approach was difficult, German soldiers defending inch by inch. American bazookas were not effective on the concrete bunkers, and tanks, followed by armed sections of flamethrowers, throw themselves on the first German lines, neither reaching them, nor neutralizing them, nor taking them. General McLain then concluded that a frontal attack would be doomed to failure and ordered his troops to keep the pressure on the outposts of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division without attacking frontally forts Jeanne-d'Arc and Lorraine. On September 16, 1944, in thick fog, the attack on Support Point Canrobert started at 10:00. It was stopped two hours later by the Fahnenjunker of Colonel Siegroth, who fought man-to-man without mercy. The Americans' 357th Infantry Regiment withdrew, leaving 72 soldiers in the field. At 5:00 pm, the 1st Battalion of the same regiment was stopped in its tracks by artillery and small arms. In the southern sector, the 2nd Battalion lost 15 officers and 117 men under heavy fire from mortars and automatic weapons from the buffer strip. At nightfall, the battalion advanced only 200 meters. Seeing that the Americans gradually ate away at their lines, the German artillery redoubled its fire, managing to contain the two regiments, and raising fears with General McLain of a new counterattack. Before the pugnacity of the elite troops of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division, General McLain, in agreement with the General Walker, decided to suspend the attacks, pending further plans of the General Staff of the 90th Infantry Division. After a rainy and cold month of little fighting, fighting resumed early November 1944. On November 9, in preparation for the offensive on Metz, the Air Force sent no less than 1,299 heavy bombers, B-17s and B-24s, to drop 3,753 tons of bombs, and 1,000 to 2,000 books on fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of IIIrd army.G√©n√©ral Jean Colin, Contribution √† l'histoire de la lib√©ration de la ville de Metz; Les combats du fort Driant (septembre-d√©cembre 1944), Acad√©mie nationale de Metz, 1963, p. 13. Most bombers, having dropped bombs without visibility at over 20,000 feet, missed their military objectives. In Metz, the 689 loads of bombs destined to strike Fort Jeanne d'Arc and six other forts, designated as priority targets, merely cause collateral damage, proving once again the inadequacy of the massive bombing of military targets.Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 424). At dawn on November 14, 1944, the 105 mm howitzers from the 359th Field Artillery Battalion opened fire on the area located on either side of Fort Jeanne d'Arc, between the Fort Francis de Guise and the Fort Driant to pave the way for the 379th Infantry regiment, whose goal was to reach the Moselle. The attack is focused on Fort Jeanne d'Arc, which ended up being completely encircled by US troops. After two deadly counterattacks against the men of Major Voss by the 462th Volksgrenadier division, German troops soon fell back to the Group Fortification. They would come out again. For the commander of Fort Jeanne-d'Arc, the finding was bitter: Losses are heavy and they did not prevent the Americans from reaching the Moselle.Hugh M. Cole: The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 432‚Äì434 Under pressure from the American artillery, and armored troops, the German units of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division eventually fell back on a more limited basis, before shutting themselves in the fort, West of Metz during the final assault on the old city of Lorraine. While the US military managed to pass the Moselle on November 18, 1944, the US command was forced to keep back forces to neutralize the elements of the 462th Volksgrenadier division still entrenched in the Group Fortification Francois de Guise and the forts surrounding. On the evening of November 23, 1944, shortly before midnight, the last detachments of the 379th Infantry Regiment withdraw from Moscou Farm, from the Farm St- Hubert, from the bunker south of Fort Guise and the Group Fortification Francois de Guise, leaving room for fresh troops of 5th Infantry Division. The Fort de Bois-la-Dame still held by a hundred men of the 462th Volks-Grenadier- Division, the Fort St Hubert and the Fort de Marival, each still manned by fifty men, finally surrendered November 26, 1944. Fort Jeanne d'Arc was the last of the forts of Metz to disarm. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army to withdraw in good order to the Saar.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 448. The objective of the German staff, which was to stall US troops for the longest possible time at Metz before they could reach the front of the Siegfried Line, was largely achieved.

He is the founder and was the first editor of the bilingual newspaper El Tecolote. El Tecolote is the longest running English-Spanish newspaper in California. Early life He was born and raised in east Stockton. He is the son of U.S. farmworkers. He attended Franklin High School. He worked as a writer and editor for his high school paper. When he attended San Francisco State University he wrote and edited for the university's newspaper. He graduated from San Francisco State University in 1968. The early beginnings of El Tecolote When he began his teaching career at San Francisco State University there was a lot of social and political changes taking place. El Tecolote came out of this social activism. The newspaper came out of a La Raza Studies class that had been created by him. The Final part of the class work was to create a bilingual newspaper that was both written in Spanish and English. He was its founder and first editor. It came out on August 24, 1970. It was given the Spanish name of El Tecolote, which means The Owl in English. The wise owl is its signature logo. The paper about a year later moved out of its college setting and into the Mission District. It started as a bi-monthly, four-page tabloid with a press run of 5,000. The need for a Latino community newspaper Juan Gonzales like many others thought there was a strong need for the creation of a bilingual local newspaper for the Latino community in the Mission District of San Francisco. To many, the mainstream media did not cover enough of the Latino news in the Mission. Many felt Latinos in the area were dealing with issues that the bigger papers did not pay much attention to. Juan has said about this need: \\"We started the paper in order to voice out through the community's perspective.\\" And many in the Latino community did not speak or read English, making it very difficult to get local news that affected them. He also believed a small Latino newspaper was just as important as any major newspaper, especially if it covered stories about issues that was affecting that person. El Tecolote does not just cover the day-to-day life of the Latino community in the Mission, it also has tried to cover all the major social and political events concerning Latinos, from bilingual services and gentrification to trying to humanize the plight of undocumented people. And the newspaper has focused on reducing poor government services, high dropout rates among Latinos, and police brutality. Advocating and practicing social activism Juan Gonzales doesn't believe in journalistic objectivity and has often advocated for the Latinos in San Francisco. He does believe journalists can be fair and should always practice accuracy and journalistic ethics, but he does not believe it is possible to be objective as a journalist. El Tecolote is a mission-driven newspaper, purposely and consciously trying to bring about progressive social change. Having an unapologetic very liberal view and promoting community activism has always been a central theme of the newspaper. Juan Gonzales considers the paper as an advocate for the continuation of the quest for Latino Civil Rights. Career As an instructor he has taught journalism for fifteen years at San Francisco State University. It was here when he taught the first college-level course on Hispanic journalism titled La Raza Journalism. Then he went on to become an instructor of journalism for City College of San Francisco where he became chair of the Department of Journalism. And as he taught, he has also worked as a publisher, editor, reporter, and columnist. In the 1970s and 1980s he worked as a reporter for United Press International and the Associated Press. Today he still helps out occasionally with the running of El Tecolote, offering advice, acting as a public face for the newspaper, and also seeking resources for the paper. Awards He has received a Heroes of Excellence Award from KGO-TV. In 2000, he was honored by the Society of Professional Journalists with its Distinguished Service Award. In 2009, he was inducted into the National Association of Hispanic Journalists Hall of Fame for advancing the interests of journalism and the interests of Latinos in Journalism. In 2011, Horace Mann Middle School had him depicted in a mural on an exterior of a wall. In March 2015 he accepted a certificate of recognition from Mayor Ed Lee for his 45 years of service as a publisher, journalism teacher, and for being a department chair of journalism.

Shortly after its establishment, Marfeel was a competitor at The TechCrunch Barcelona Meetup, a competition it eventually won. Prior to requesting its first funding, the company was accepted in two startup accelerators: Wayra, Telef√≥nica's's accelerator and SeedRocket. The initial idea came as Beumala noticed that most websites, when displayed in mobile devices or tablets, offered a rather impractical duplicate of their desktop version. Beumala and Margenat, both avid technology fans, thought that they could combine these interests to create a business solution to the problem. Marfeel raised $2 million in 2013, in a Series A round. The round was led by Nauta Capital, with Elaia Partners, BDMI, and Wayra also investing. After announcing a 300% growth in 2015, Marfeel was listed in The Next Web's European Tech5 in March 2015. In January 2015 Marfeel became a certified Google partner, becoming Spain's first Google recommended mobile vendor.

He is an authority on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety disorders whose work is highly cited. He maintains a research lab and serves as the Director of the UNC-CH Anxiety and Stress Disorders Clinic. Abramowitz approaches the understanding and treatment of psychological problems from a cognitive- behavioral perspective. Academic career Abramowitz earned his B.A. in Psychology from Muhlenberg College in 1991, his M.A. in Psychology from Bucknell University in 1993, and his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Memphis in 1998. He completed both a predoctoral internship and postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania. He was a staff psychologist and Associate Professor at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) from 2000 until 2006. He moved to North Carolina in the summer of 2006. Abramowitz's research focuses on the development and evaluation of cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) for OCD and other anxiety-related problems, as well as on understanding the nature and psychopathology of these problems. He is the author of approximately 300 publications, including more than 10 books and over 250 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters. He has also worked extensively as a book and journal editor. Abramowitz has given invited lectures around the world and served in numerous editorial and advisory roles for scientific journals and organizations. Abramowitz is board certified by the American Board of Behavioral Psychology and is a licensed psychologist in North Carolina. In his clinical practice, he specializes in providing outpatient consultation and cognitive-behavioral treatment of OCD and other anxiety-related problems. Research areas and contributions Abramowitz lecturing in Bergen, Norway Treatment of OCD and anxiety: A major focus of Abramowitz's research is the treatment of OCD. His work primarily addresses exposure and response prevention (ERP; a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) and he has conducted treatment outcome studies and meta-analytic reviews of this therapy. He has also investigated factors that predict good and poor outcomes. Abramowitz has helped to develop an OCD treatment program combining ERP with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). He has also helped to develop couple- based ERP programs for OCD and Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Abramowitz has written about, and is conducting research to better understand, how to enhance the outcome of exposure therapy/ERP by optimizing extinction learning. This work is drawn from inhibitory learning models of exposure. Nature and symptoms of OCD: Abramowitz's research also focuses on trying to understand the complex symptomatology of OCD. His work has identified 4 subtypes/dimensions of this disorder that involve somewhat distinct cognitive and behavioral phenomena: (a) contamination, (b) responsibility for harm/mistakes, (c) unacceptable thoughts, and (d) incompleteness/symmetry. He has also contributed to the re- conceptualization of hoarding as separate from OCD. Abramowitz has argued that OCD symptoms lie on a continuum with normal everyday experiences, and that one‚Äôs learning history (and to a lesser extent, their biology) influence the frequency, intensity, and duration of OCD symptoms. He has also criticized the DSM-5‚Äôs re-classification of OCD as separate from the anxiety disorders and as overlapping with conditions such as Hair Pulling Disorder and Skin Picking Disorder. Abramowitz is generally critical of biomedical models which view problems such as OCD and anxiety as brain diseases or genetic disorders. Assessment of OCD: Abramowitz led a team of researchers in 2010 that developed the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS), a 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure the severity of the four types of OCD symptoms (see above). The DOCS has been translated into multiple languages for use worldwide. Cognitive-behavioral factors and models of OCD and anxiety: The cognitive-behavioral model is the leading conceptual approach to understanding OCD and anxiety disorders. Abramowitz conducts cross-sectional, experimental, and prospective (longitudinal) research that has helped to clarify and advance this conceptual model. His work focuses on cognitive biases such as anxiety sensitivity, thought-action fusion, intolerance of uncertainty, and attentional biases that factor in the persistence of OCD and irrational fear. With his team at UNC, he has developed experimental paradigms for studying thought-action fusion and intolerance of uncertainty. His work has also demonstrated that cognitive factors prospectively predict the escalation of intrusive thoughts into obsessions. Abramowitz also conducts studies on cognitive-behavioral factors in other anxiety and related problems, including health/illness anxiety, shy bladder syndrome, panic disorder, and hoarding. Scrupulosity: Abramowitz has conducted studies on, and developed a cognitive- behavioral model of, scrupulosity (religious obsessions and compulsions). He also developed the Penn Inventory of Scrupulosity (PIOS) to measure this phenomenon. Prevention of postpartum OCD: Abramowitz developed and evaluated a prevention program for OCD symptoms in new parents. This work was derived from previous studies led by Abramowitz showing that certain types of cognitive/psychological phenomena (such as the tendency to catastrophically misinterpret unwanted thoughts) predict the development of OCD symptoms in the postpartum. The prevention program, known as \\"Baby PREP\\", can be delivered as part of perinatal education classes and was shown to be more effective than a credible placebo control program in preventing OCD symptoms among vulnerable expecting/new parents. Cross-cultural factors: Abramowitz has conducted research on cultural, religious, and racial differences in the expression of anxiety and OCD symptoms and related phenomena. He is part of a multi-national collaborative effort studying the nature of intrusive obsessional thoughts in cultures and countries around the world. Awards, recognition, and leadership Abramowitz delivers the Presidential Address at the 2015 ABCT Convention Abramowitz's contributions to the fields of OCD, anxiety disorders, and clinical psychology are recognized by his colleagues, peers, and the media through numerous honors, awards, and appearances. He is a Fellow and Past President of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) and serves on the International OCD Foundation Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board. He is the recipient of a Muhlenberg College Alumni Achievement Award, the David Shakow Early Career Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Science and Practice of Clinical Psychology (from Division 12 of the American Psychological Association), and the Mayo Clinic Department of Psychiatry and Psychology Outstanding Contributions to Research Award. Abramowitz has served on the Editorial Boards of several scientific journals and as Associate Editor of Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy (2008‚Äìpresent) and Associate Editor of Behaviour Research and Therapy (2006-2015). He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders. Expertscape ranks him among the top 20 experts on OCD and his ResearchGate score is higher than 97.5% of this site's members. Abramowitz was invited by colleagues in Norway to help train and supervise 30 OCD treatment teams in that country. The training is part of an initiative funded by the Norwegian government to ensure that all individuals with OCD in Norway have access to effective treatment. Abramowitz has twice been appointed as Associate Chair of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, a position he held from 2007-2017. Personal life Abramowitz lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, with his wife and two daughters. Selected works=Books * Abramowitz, J. S. (2006).

A 2012 molecular study found it was most closely related to V. grosseserrata. Veronica plebeia grows as a perennial herb, with stolons reaching 1 m (3 ft) in length. Roots appear at nodes along the stolons. The flowering stems can grow to 10 cm (4 in) tall. The leaves are roughly triangular or heart-shaped (cordate), measuring around 0.8‚Äì2 cm (0.3‚Äì0.6 in) long, and 0.5‚Äì1.6 cm (0.2‚Äì0.5 in) across. The lilac to pale blue flowers appear from September to June, with peak times between October and January, as well as April. They grow in clusters of 2 to 8. Veronica plebeia is found in all states and territories apart from the Northern Territory. It is widely distributed across eastern New South Wales. In Queensland it is found as far north as Tully and the Atherton Tableland. It is rare in Tasmania, restricted to the Tamar Valley and scattered locations on the east coast. It has been recorded from scattered coastal locations in the North Island as well as northwest Nelson in the South Island, and the Chatham Islands. There has been debate over whether it is native or naturalised, but it occurs in areas of little disturbance, suggesting the former. It has become naturalised in Norfolk Island. It grows on clay soils over shale, in wet sclerophyll forest under such trees as Eucalyptus viminalis, E. fastigata, E. pilularis, in dry sclerophyll forest under Eucalyptus punctata, E. fibrosa, and open woodland under Angophora bakeri, Eucalyptus sclerophylla, Melaleuca decora, Eucalyptus moluccana and E. tereticornis.

It replaced the high-floor Goldliner variant of the long-running Duple Dominant range as Duple's premium coach body of the mid 1980s. Variants The original Caribbean was introduced in 1983 as Duple's upmarket / high-floor coach and was available on 12 metre long mid-engined DAF, Dennis, Leyland and Volvo chassis. At the time Duple was attempting to develop its own integral coach designs and a one-off rear-engined semi-integral Caribbean was built on Neoplan running gear as a prototype. The design bonded glazing which distinguished it from the contemporary low-floor Duple Laser (early examples of which had gasket glazing). Quad headlights and a narrow chrome grille were standard, although twin headlights and a wider grille (as used on the Duple Calypso) could be specified as an option. The bonded-glazed Calypso was similar in appearance to the Caribbean, but was closer in height to the Laser. At the end of 1984 the Caribbean range was given a facelift and renamed the Caribbean II. The main difference was a revised front with twin headlamps and plastic grille, shared with the contemporary Laser 2 (which gained bonded glazing at this time, becoming closer in appearance to the Caribbean II). Replacement At the end of 1985 the new Duple 320 and 340 were launched as replacements for the Laser and Caribbean ranges respectively.

Biography Joan Maie Freeman was born in Perth on 7 January 1918. Her family moved to Sydney in 1922 and she attended the Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School. While still a girl, she took evening classes at Sydney Technical College. The school hid her attendance from inspectors, as they thought a girl in the class would reflect negatively on the college. She completed her Intermediate Certificate Examination and earned a place at the University of Sydney in 1936. Freeman studied mathematics, chemistry, physics and zoology, and was often the only woman, indeed the school stipulated that a seat had to be left vacant between women and men in a lecture hall). She received her BSc in 1940 and was awarded a Commonwealth Research Scholarship to continue her MSc.  Career  Freeman took a position at the Radiophysics Laboratory of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research as a research officer in June 1941. She researched radar during World War II. After the war ended, Freeman engaged in research on the behaviour of low-pressure gas discharges at microwave frequencies. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research then awarded her a Senior Studentship that allowed her to read for her PhD at the University of Cambridge in England. She attended Newnham College and later studied short-range alpha particles with Alex Baxter, working on the HT1 accelerator. In 1951 Freeman became Senior Scientific Officer at the Harwell Tandem Accelerator Group. She later led the group and received the Rutherford Medal and Prize in 1976 with Roger Blin-Stoyle, for their research of the beta-radioactivity of complex nuclei. She was the first woman to win the Rutherford Medal. She received an honorary doctorate from Sydney University and fellowships from the Institute of Physics and the American Physical Society. She retired in 1978. Freeman was posthumously appointed Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1999 Australia Day Honours for \\"service to science in the field of nuclear physics and to the environment as an advocate for social responsibility in scientific research\\". Freeman wrote the 1991 book A Passion for Physics. Freeman married John Jelley in 1958. She died in Oxford on 18 March 1998.

He won a Silver Slugger Award in 2018. Career=Tampa Bay Rays M√°rquez signed with the Tampa Bay Rays as an international free agent in July 2011. The Rays added him to their 40-man roster after the 2015 season. Colorado Rockies On January 28, 2016, M√°rquez and Jake McGee were traded to the Colorado Rockies in exchange for Corey Dickerson and Kevin Padlo. Marquez was promoted to the Major Leagues on September 6, 2016. 2017 In his first full season in 2017, M√°rquez went 11-7 with a 4.39 ERA in 162 innings (29 starts), notching a 1.38 WHIP and 147 strikeouts (8.17 K/9). He had the highest zone percentage of all major league pitchers, with 53.2% of his pitches being in the strike zone. He finished fifth in the National League Rookie of the Year voting. 2018 On July 11, 2018, M√°rquez hit his first career home run off second baseman and former teammate Daniel Descalso in a 19-2 Rockies win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. M√°rquez became the first pitcher to hit a home run off a position player since Mike LaCoss in 1986. On September 26, 2018, M√°rquez tied a major-league record by striking out the first eight batters of a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, before pitcher Nick Pivetta reached base on an error on a 0-2 pitch. M√°rquez also broke the franchise record for single-season strikeouts in a season which had been previously held by Ubaldo Jim√©nez back in 2010. M√°rquez had a dominant second half of the 2018 season after working a slider into his pitching repertoire. He ultimately finished with a 14-11 record (his 14 wins were 9th- most in the NL) and 3.77 ERA in 33 starts (2nd; 20 of which were quality outings), with 230 strikeouts (4th) in 196 innings pitched (9th). He had a WHIP of 1.20. His 10.561 K/9 (fourth in the National League) was a new franchise record. M√°rquez also had a phenomenal season at the plate, hitting .300 (18 for 60) with a home run, 5 RBIs, and a .650 OPS. He received the Silver Slugger Award as the best-hitting pitcher in the National League, becoming the first Rockies pitcher to win the award since Mike Hampton in 2002. Marquez's performance, along with the breakout season of Colorado native Kyle Freeland are widely credited with helping the Rockies reach the postseason in back to back years for the first time in franchise history. 2019 At the start of the 2019 season, the Rockies and M√°rquez agreed to a 5-year $43 million contract. On April 14, 2019, M√°rquez threw the first one- hit complete game in Rockies franchise history in a 4-0 win, yielding only a single to Evan Longoria in the 8th inning. In 2019, he started 28 games, winning 12, and had a 4.76 ERA before being placed on the injured list with right arm inflammation on August 26. Though his ERA was a full point higher than that of 2018, Marquez by and large maintained his consistency from the previous year. Additionally, Marquez's ERA was ballooned by 3 games where he was not taken out despite struggling badly; the last of which was a home game on July 15, 2019 where he gave up a career-worst 11 runs (all earned) in only 2.2 innings to the San Francisco Giants before he was taken out of the game. 2020 In 2020, on defense he led all National League pitchers in errors, with three.

He played for the school's baseball team as a pitcher, considering himself to be the third-best pitcher on his team. Attending a tryout at the University of Kansas, he caught the attention of a coach from the college baseball team of Neosho County Community College. In 2012, he pitched to a 9‚Äì3 win-loss record and a 1.48 earned run average (ERA), helping the Neosho County Panthers reach the 2012 National Junior College Athletic Association World Series. After two seasons with Neosho, he committed to transfer to the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. Kansas City Royals The Kansas City Royals selected Strahm in the 21st round, with the 643rd overall selection, of the 2012 MLB draft.http://www.inforum.com/content/kansas-city-royals-draft-west-fargos- strahm He signed with the Royals, receiving a $100,000 signing bonus, rather than transfer to Nebraska. He made his professional debut with the Idaho Falls Chukars of the Rookie-level Pioneer League. Strahm required Tommy John surgery during the 2013 season to repair damage to the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow. He missed most of the 2014 season, throwing only innings for Idaho Falls. In 2015, he pitched for the Lexington Legends of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) and Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. He was named a SAL All-Star.

When Wade Davis went on the disabled list, the Royals promoted Strahm to the major leagues on July 31, 2016. He made his MLB debut that day. Though most of his minor league experience was as a starting pitcher, the Royals deployed Strahm as a relief pitcher for the remainder of the 2016 season in order to not increase the number of innings thrown from the 2015 season by too many. At the end of the 2016 season, the Royals indicated that Strahm would compete for a spot in their starting rotation during spring training in 2017. However, after acquiring Nate Karns, Travis Wood, and Jason Hammel, Ned Yost, the Royals' manager, announced at the start of spring training that Strahm would be a reliever in 2017. Strahm made 24 appearances, 3 starts for the Royals in 2017 before being shut down for the season with a torn patellar tendon in his left knee. San Diego Padres On July 24, 2017, the Royals traded Strahm, Travis Wood, and Esteury Ruiz to the San Diego Padres for Trevor Cahill, Ryan Buchter, and Brandon Maurer.

It was published in 2011 by Ballantine Books. The novel follows the fraught life of a Victoria Jones, who by the age of 18, had lived in 32 foster homes, and becomes a flower arranger. The novel was inspired by a flower dictionary, a type of Victorian-era book which defines what different types of flowers mean. Diffenbaugh also published a new non-fiction \\"A Victorian Flower Dictionary\\" to accompany the novel. The novel was recommended for use in book clubs.  Themes  The plot of the novel focuses on finding love, adoption, emancipation, homelessness, single motherhood and attachment disorder, but the main focus is on the foster system. The SFGate reviewer Malena Watrous described the novel as much less \\"grittier\\" than other discussions of the foster system, which Watrous partially attributes to Diffenbaugh's own adoption of children from that system. Though the flowers within the novel largely function as symbols for Victoria, expressing emotional meaning, the novel also includes a large amount of information about the biology of flowers. New York Times Reviewer Janet Maslin described this information as sometimes becoming overly pedantic, saying \\"the pointed use of flower definitions in conversation begins to pale as a gambit.\\" Conversely, NPR called this motif \\"organic,\\" growing from the first scene in a flower marketplace.  Style  The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin praised the descriptive language, saying \\"There is sensuality to Ms. Diffenbaugh‚Äôs descriptions of flowers and food.\\" The novel interlaces the main plot of an 18 year old Victoria, with snippets of her past in the foster system.  Reception  Reception of the novel was generally positive. Washington Post reviewer Brigitte Weeks called the novel an \\"original and brilliant first novel\\" which has \\"united her fascination with the language of flowers‚Äîa long- forgotten and mysterious way of communication‚Äîwith her firsthand knowledge of the travails of the foster-care system.\\" For Weeks, the \\"novel is both enchanting and cruel, full of beauty and anger.\\" The New York Times compared the novel to something \\"Dickens might have come up with, had Dickens been deeply interested in flower arranging.\\" SFGate called the novel \\"an unexpectedly beautiful book about an ugly subject: children who grow up without families, and what becomes of them in the absence of unconditional love.\\" Waltrous compares the novel to Jane Eyre, identifying the novel as part of the \\"story of an orphan rising above her circumstances\\" with motifs like a tortured romance.  Film adaptation  In 2019, it was announced there will be a film adaptation of the novel starring Nick Robinson and Kiersey Clemons and directed by Michael Mayer.

The only one left open was the San Giacomo in Augusta Church, in Via del Corso. There Carlotta met the parish priest don Giuseppe Trappolini, they had a very touching conversation and, as Don Giuseppe said, she \\"cried from Joy\\" as she talked about her story, her battle against melanoma and the tranquillity she felt after listening to the words of Pope Francis. The priest was moved by a remarkable coincidence: just the day before he was received with some other Roman priests by the Pope and in that occasion the Holy Father asked them to keep the churches open on Good Friday all day long to allow anybody to confess. So Don Trappolini decided to tell the Pope the story of Carlotta in a letter and on April 10 morning, the Pope rang up back to tell he would pray for her, adding: \\"This girl gives me courage\\". Just in the moments of the phone call, Carlotta was seized by a cerebral crisis in the Hospital of Carrara, where she had gone as a volunteer musician of the \\"Music Donors\\". On waking up in the ward, on the morning of 11 April 2013, after having recovered lucidity, still in bed and in the company of his mother, she reported that she was having a Trinitarian vision consisting of a luminous triangle on the chamber wall.Fede - Vita di Carlotta Nobile Even Carlotta wrote him a letter to communicate her faith in life and in God‚Äôs encounter.\\"Caro papa Francesco, il cancro mi ha guarito nell‚Äôanima\\", video- intervista di Aleteia a Don Giuseppe Trappolini\\"Don Giuseppe Trappolini, parroco romano, √® stato ospite a pranzo di Papa Francesco\\", intervista di Tv2000 a Don Giuseppe Trappolini You can read in the letter:  The last three months  Thanks to Don Trappolini, Carlotta was about to meet personally the Pope but, in May 2013 her condition started to get worse and so she went back to Benevento and she spent the last months of her life in her family house.

Fran√ßois-Marie L√©thel celebrates a Mass for Carlotta - Life of Carlotta Nobile The theologian Father Fran√ßois-Marie L√©thel O.C.D., one of the leading experts in the theology of saints, Consultor of the Congregation of the Causes of Saints and Preacher of the spiritual exercises to the Holy Father Benedict XVI and to the Roman Curia in 2011, wrote about her: \\"Yes, Jesus was really \\"the greatest love\\" of Carlotta in the sufferings of the last months. (...) Together with her, we too thank Jesus for the gift of his infinite love and we learn to joyfully carry the cross. With her witness on earth and now with her intercession in heaven, Carlotta will help us to walk towards holiness.\\"From the Introduction to the biography In un attimo l'infinito. Carlotta Nobile (F. Rizzo and P. Scarafoni, Paoline, 2017) Thus Msgr. Andrea Mugione, Archbishop Emeritus of Benevento: ¬´Jesus returns to the Father, but the ascending Jesus carries with him the gift of his wounds, of his wounds. (...) And He tells us that this is the price of forgiveness that He gives us. The price that Carlotta also paid by joining Christ. With prayer, joining the wounds of Jesus, she brought with him - it is true - she brought her wounds with her as a gift to the Father. (...) This is why I say that with Carlotta, with the last few months of her life, where she lived strong moments of faith and surrender to the Lord ... with Carlotta we can carry forward what is the evangelization of Suffering, to help us re-read the experience of Suffering in the light of the mystery of Love and pain of Christ, who saved us not from the Cross but in the Cross. (...) In the Cross, she, Carlotta, certainly understood what the Faith is worth - and lived it deeply - how much Love is worth, how much the Joy of living is worth - and she had so much of Joy of life -. For this we can really call her ... in her suffering she has become a Witness of the Faith.\\" Dicono di lei - Life of Carlotta Nobile The Archbishop of Taranto Msgr. Filippo Santoro said of her: \\"A life so full of intensity, of various interests, music, song, culture, literature ... (...) but her success is accomplished in that day of the experience of March 4, 2013 in which there is the perception that life is realized when one gives, life is realized when it is opened to others, it opens up to the mystery of love (...). And therefore we stammer before these testimonies, which show us that the Cross and the Resurrection go together, that the Cross is the path to follow. (...) At a time when at the end, the last words - \\"Lord, I thank you. Lord, I thank you. Lord, I thank you.\\"- they open wide on an extraordinary hope. This is a thing of holiness. It could not be explained without the presence of Christ. \\" Msgr. Francesco Zerrillo, Bishop Emeritus of Lucera-Troia, expressed himself in this way, commenting on the last months of the life of Carlotta: ¬´The last was the time of ascents. (...) I saw the sacredness of life. I saw the gift of life. (...) Thus Carlotta's life has become a life-gift, a life offered to God. She was truly a prodigy. (...) I would like to stimulate everyone to a deeper knowledge of this girl, who was really brave. She was a seed of hope that offers a positive message, offers help to those who are discouraged in life and offers everyone the vision of a \\"beyond\\". (...) That \\"beyond\\" of Carlotta is a vision that is no longer earthly, but is heavenly, no longer human, but divine. \\" Archbishop Michele Seccia, Archbishop of Lecce, recounts this: ¬´A person who leaves us a special witness in life. Her memory so alive to you today becomes a watermark, a litmus paper through which the Word of God we have heard becomes even more understandable. (...) She has sown in his life so well in taking care of cancer patients, of terminal people. (...) The Gospel is current! If today our friend Nobile reminds us that a sudden listening to an inner light, a dream, a word of the Gospel, a rediscovered certainty is enough, the safe way of death is the way of Life! A logical absurdity, but it is the way of Salvation, of Hope. (...) And we really want to thank God for giving us the opportunity to reflect on this in the light of a concrete experience. \\" So instead Msgr. Gennaro Pascarella, Bishop of Pozzuoli: ¬´And I am certain that this evening Carlotta is with us. When we say the Creed we say \\"I believe the communion of saints\\", that is, I believe that among us the Church here on this Earth and our brothers who have preceded us there is this communion, this exchange also of prayers. I am sure that she also played her part this evening from Heaven. Y She has truly experienced an ordeal, she has experienced human frailty to the full, which takes the body and consumes it. She tells us ¬´even in our frailties Jesus is there. He is present¬ª. Indeed, while I listened to you I felt strongly once again that even in what is the greatest fragility, death, even there God came down, Jesus is there and gives us hope. Here, I now want to invite you to say that prayer so dear to Carlotta, the Our Father, which must be the prayer of every disciple of Jesus. \\" Recognitions In September 2013, she posthumously received the ANLAI Prize,Conclusion of the fourth international competition of lutherie Anlai in Pisogne ‚Äì Cremona ‚Äì Lombardianews, online informationThe Anlai prize, www.anlailiuteria.it and the Arechi II Prize from the Province of Benevento in June 2014.http://rassegnastampa.unipi.it/rassegna/archivio/2014/06/05SIJ4103.PDFArechi II and Gladiatore d'oro Prize Award The \\"Carlotta Nobile\\" Classroom in the Department of History of Art and Performing Arts of Sapienza University of Rome.

Former Kraken COO Michael Gronager, during the security analysis for onboarding the new cryptocurrencies, spotted a major vulnerability in the domain registration system and a bug that left .bit domain names susceptible to attacks and reassignment. Although the flaws were soon fixed and Namecoin was listed on the Kraken exchange, it was de- listed two years later after a decline in its trading volumes.  2014 to 2015  In March 2014, Kraken received a US$5 million Series A investment led by Hummingbird Ventures. Other investors included Trace Mayer and Barry Silbert (Bitcoin Opportunity Fund). In April 2014, Kraken became one of the first bitcoin exchanges to be listed on Bloomberg Terminal. In July 2014, Kraken was part of a group of businesses that advised Mineyuki Fukuda (who was a member of the Japanese parliament at the time) and his IT committee on forming the Japan Authority of Digital Assets (JADA). JADA is the first Bitcoin regulatory body with government backing. In May 2015, Kraken announced the beta launch of margin trading, becoming one of the few bitcoin exchanges to offer trading on margin. Initially the maximum allowed leverage for trading long or short was 3x (later raised to 5x). In June 2015, Kraken opened a bitcoin pool of Dark liquidity (or ‚Äúdark pool‚Äù).  2016  After its public refusal, Kraken expressed an intention to return service to New York residence pending the removal of what it perceived as unfair and counterproductive licensing. Coinsetter announced to clients in December 2015 that it would thenceforth impose a $65 fee to offset the cost of the very same BitLicense Kraken refused to afford. In absorbing Coinsetter, and by extension Cavirtex, the following month, Kraken opened up its platform to residents of 37 other states, and to all Canadian residents. Alongside this deal, Kraken announced partnerships with payment providers SynapsePay in the U.S. and Vogogo in Canada, in order to provide its newest clients with access to fiat deposits and withdrawals respectively. One month later, Kraken announced the completion of its Series B round of investment lead by SBI Investment, a prominent Japanese venture capitalist firm under SBI Holdings. Following this investment round, Kraken announced two major acquisitions that year: Dutch exchange CleverCoin, which was acquired in June, and Glidera, a cryptocurrency wallet service allowing users to directly fund Glidera bank accounts with fiat for the purchase of cryptocurrencies on the Kraken exchange. 2017 to present In April 2017, Kraken launched fiat funding options to transfer denominated US dollars and government-issued currencies. Not long after Monero was listed Kraken continued to list additional crypto-currencies in the following months, such as USDT, MLN and Dash. In March Kraken acquired popular website Cryptowatch a real time charting site for crypto-currencies that is often used by day traders. During the acquisition they also hired the founder of Cryptowatch Artur Sapek to help integrate Cryptowatch into Krakens systems and further the development of the platform. In August 2017, Kraken listed Bitcoin Cash - a hard-fork of Bitcoin with all clients that held bitcoin before the fork receiving an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash. By December 2017 Kraken was registering up to 50,000 new users a day. On January 10, 2018, Kraken suspended trading for over 48 hours while it performed an upgrade which was intended to take only 2 hours. Since first opening in 2011, this was the longest interruption to service. In April 2018, Kraken announced the closing of its services in Japan, after operating since October 2014, by the end of June due to the rising costs of doing business there. In February, 2019, Kraken announced that it had raised $100 million in a direct offering to its largest customers at a $4 billion valuation. In May 2019, Kraken filed a motion in California's Marin County Superior Court to identify ten anonymous reviewers on Glassdoor. Kraken is suing the ten reviewers, claiming they are former employees in breach of their severance contract. The EFF, which represents the anonymous reviewers, claims that identifying the reviewers would harm their first amendment speech rights and chill the speech of others. In June 2019, Kraken received $13.5 million from 2,263 individual investors via a BnkToTheFuture special purpose vehicle.  Role in Mt Gox Liquidation and Fund Recovery  In November 2014, Nobuaki Kobayashi, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee overseeing the Mt. Gox liquidation, announced that Kraken was chosen to assist with the investigation of lost bitcoin and the process of returning remaining funds to creditors. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, the trustee said that Kraken was chosen because of its proven operating history and because the company reports that its system has never been breached by hackers. Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in February 2014. CEO Mark Karpel√®s said at the time that about 850,000 bitcoins had been lost, 100,000 belonging to the company and the rest belonging to about 127,000 creditors. Later Karpel√®s found about 200,000 bitcoins, leaving about 650,000 still missing. An article in the New York Times pointed out that the process of returning funds could significantly benefit Kraken because creditors will probably have to create a Kraken account to get their money back and some of them might continue using the exchange. In April 2015, Kraken started accepting Mt. Gox creditor claims through its website, a process which required creditors to create a Kraken account. Creditors could also file their claim through the Mt. Gox website. Kraken offered the incentive of up to $1 million in free trade volume to creditors filing their claim with Kraken. On July 6, 2015 the trustee announced that the deadline for filing online claims was July 29, 2015. However, the trustee did not at that time announce any deadline for the paper filing option. As of the September 9, 2015 creditor meeting, the trustee reported funds secured for the Mt. Gox estate of 1,242,068,375 JPY and 202,159 bitcoins (together worth about $60 million at the time). The trustee reported that he was still in the process of trying to secure more funds for the estate and that Kraken's assistance in investigating lost bitcoin was ongoing. No date was given for when the creditors might expect to receive their share of remaining funds, but the trustee said that the date for investigating creditor claims was extended to the date of the next creditor meeting.  NY Attorney General Inquiry Into Cryptocurrencies (2018)  The New York Attorney General's Office began a fact finding investigation in April 2018 on the measures taken by cryptocurrency exchanges to protect their customers and fight market manipulation and money laundering. The New York State attorney general warned that the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange might be breaking the law. \\"Customers should be aware that the platforms that refused to participate in the OAG's Initiative (Binance, Gate.io, Huobi, and Kraken) may not disclose all order types offered to certain traders, some of which could preference those traders at the expense of others, and that the trading performance of other customers on those venues could be negatively affected as a result.\\" Powell claimed that the investigation was hostile and bad for business, and refused to comply with the inquiry. He claimed that market manipulation \\"doesn't matter to most crypto traders,\\" and stated that \\"scams are rampant\\" among cryptocurrency exchanges. In May 2018, Powell said that Kraken was considering registering as an alternative trading system (ATS), which would bring the company directly under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight. The Attorney General's Office's final report, issued in September 2018, emphasized Kraken's non-participation in the inquiry and referred Kraken (as well as Binance and Gate.io) to the New York Department of Financial Services for potential violation of New York's virtual currency regulations.

Early life and career CE Dolling, 1914. Charlie Dolling was born in the South Australian rural community of Wokurna on the Yorke Peninsula, inland from Port Broughton, to a family of German origin. He went to school at Way College in Unley and Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, where he captained the First XI in 1904‚Äì05 and 1905‚Äì06. In December 1904, in the annual match against St Peter's College, he scored 311 and took six wickets in an innings victory. In the corresponding match a year later he made 106 and 27 not out and took 13 wickets in a nine- wicket victory. A few weeks later he made his first-class debut for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield match against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He scored 30 in the second innings and put on 80 for the fourth wicket with Norman Claxton, and South Australia went on to win by 120 runs. In the match against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground that followed immediately, he top-scored in the second innings with 83 not out. While studying for a medical degree at Adelaide University he was a regular player for South Australia. He made his first century against New South Wales in 1907‚Äì08, when his 113 in the second innings allowed South Australia to leave New South Wales to score 593 for victory, and they were eventually all out for 572. Later that season he made 140 against the touring MCC. He was selected to play for The Rest against an Australian XI at the end of the season, and again at the end of the 1910‚Äì11 season. Once he graduated and began his medical career he had less time for cricket. In 1912 he took up a practice in Minlaton on the Yorke Peninsula. He did not play any first-class cricket in the 1912‚Äì13 or 1913‚Äì14 seasons, but was nevertheless selected to tour New Zealand with the Australian team at the end of the 1913‚Äì14 Australian season. He played in both matches against New Zealand, scoring 109 in 118 minutes in the second match at Auckland. World War I and later career Dolling was studying and working in England when World War I began in 1914. He enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1915 and served in Egypt, at the 15th RAMC Hospital in Alexandria, and in France. He returned to Australia in 1921. He captained South Australia in his last three first-class matches in 1922‚Äì23, two of them against the visiting MCC team. In Adelaide cricket for West Torrens in 1922‚Äì23 he made 856 runs at an average of 71.33, setting a new club record. On 13 February 1923, at St Paul's Anglican Church, Adelaide, he married Dorothy Clarke, a New Zealander with a degree in advanced mathematics, who shared his love of cricket. They had a daughter and a son. Dolling became a cricket selector for South Australia, and in 1928 he was appointed to the Australian Test selection panel. He continued to serve in both positions until his death, and also managed South Australian teams. He did post-graduate study at a London hospital in 1934, at a time that coincided with the Australian Test team's tour of England. He also studied in Germany; he spoke German fluently. Death He suffered a seizure in his surgery on 11 June 1936 and died within an hour.Irving Rosenwater, \\"Sir Donald Bradman ‚Äì Selector\\", Wisden 1972, pp. 108‚Äì09. In an obituary, The Referee, assessing his work as a selector, said he \\"was an exceptional judge of a cricketer and possessed a high judicial sense of fair play\\". Don Bradman, who was appointed to the Test selection panel in his place, said Dolling was \\"a wise and tactful administrator, and that, as a selector, he enjoyed the confidence of everybody\\". Dorothy (1897‚Äì1967) was a prominent member of the Country Women's Association and was awarded the OBE for her welfare work during World War II.

Active primarily in the northern province of the Transvaal (since divided into Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and Limpopo), she is recognized as one of the most influential pioneers of ballet in South Africa.Marina Grut, \\"De Villiers, Faith,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1982), p. 372. Early life and training Faith de Villiers was born in Johannesburg, the largest city in the Transvaal and the center of gold mining and industry in South Africa. Her father was a descendant of French Hugenots who had come to the Dutch Cape Colony in the days of early settlement. Most such families learned Afrikaans and were assimilated into Afrikaner culture, because of similarities in their Protestant religious beliefs, and most had stayed in the Cape Province. Faith's ancestors had moved north to Johannesburg, however, and had become resolutely Anglophonic and Anglophilic, speakers of English and lovers of all things British. She began her dance training at an early age, with Delphine Thompson, a pupil of one of the founders of the Cecchetti Society in South Africa. At age 12, she entered the Johannesburg Cambrian Society National Eisteddfod and was judged best all- around dancer in the 11- to 13-year-old category. The gold medal, presented to her by Dulcie Howes, the adjudicator and a national celebrity, was accompanied by a bursary that started her off on her career in dance.Richard Glasstone, Dulcie Howes: Pioneer of Ballet in South Africa (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1996), p. 122. At age 18, de Villiers got a temporary dancing job with the Carl Rosa Opera Company when it toured South Africa for three months in 1938. Her earnings allowed her to travel to London, where she studied under Margaret Craske, a teacher of the Cecchetti method of ballet training, and Igor Schwezoff, a Russian who had trained at the Leningrad Choreographic School. At the time, war clouds were gathering over continental Europe, and it did not seem prudent for her to remain much longer in England. Professional career De Villiers returned to Johannesburg in 1939 and became ballet mistress, choreographer, and ensemble director for African Consolidated Theatres. After some years, she formed her own performing group, Ballet Theatre, with Joyce van Geems, in 1947. It was the first of several such troupes that she would initiate. The next year, she married and moved to Cape Town, where she began teaching at the school of the South African National Ballet, producing ballets, and touring the group to nearby Stellenbosch and Paarl. She returned frequently to Johannesburg, despite the great distance, to continue her work with African Consolidated Theatres. With her husband and child, she moved back to her home city in 1952 and continued producing ballets for performances in cities and towns throughout the Transvaal and in neighboring Mozambique. When Yvonne Mounsey returned to South Africa from New York in 1959, de Villiers joined her in founding the Johannesburg City Ballet, of which she became artistic director in 1961. The company was renamed Ballet Transvaal and then, in 1963, PACT Ballet, so called for the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal and known in Afrikaans as TRUK Ballet, for the Transvaalse Raad vir die Uitvoerende Kunste.David Poole, \\"The South African Way: Four Professional Ballet Companies Subsidized by the Government,\\" Dance and Dancers (London), May 1969, pp. 18ff. With a government subsidy, PACT Ballet became a fully professional, bilingual company, guided by de Villiers as artistic manager from 1964 until 1969.Eve Borland, \\"CAPAB and PACT Ballet, South Africa,\\" Dance Gazette (London), no. 188 (March 1985), 29-32. Traces the development of the two companies from 1964 to 1985. During her five-year tenure in this position, she was responsible for bringing the great French ballerina Yvette Chauvir√© to dance Giselle in theaters in Johannesburg and nearby Pretoria.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"PACT Ballet,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). She hired Alexander Bennett, a former Royal Ballet principal, to be ballet master and to produce Copp√©lia, Aurora's Wedding (Aurora se Huwelik), and Frederick Ashton's Les Patineurs. In 1965, Yvonne Mounsey staged a version of the pas de deux from Jerome Robbins's Interplay (Heen-en-weer-spel); Peter Clegg recreated Ashton's Fa√ßade; and de Villiers herself mounted Walter Gore's production of Casse Noisette (The Nutcracker, Die Neutkraker) for the Christmas season at the splendid, new Civic Theatre.

Covers the period 1963-1972). When Frank Staff arrived as resident choreographer, he mounted his charming Peter and the Wolf, originally created for Ballet Rambert in London, and created seven new works for the company, including Five Faces of Euridice (Vyf Fasette van Euridice, 1965), Czernyana III (1966), and Raka (1967).Theater programs and playbills, PACT/TRUK Ballet, Civic Theatre, Johannesburg, and Aula Theatre, Pretoria, 1965-1967. Archives, Joburg Ballet, Biccard Street, Johannesburg; Jerome Robbins Dance Division, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts; and other major collections of dance materials in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. Under de Villiers's aegis, PACT Ballet performed in many major cities of South Africa, including Pretoria, Bloemfontein, Kimberley, Durban, and Cape Town. It also traveled across the Limpopo River to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where it was presented by the Rhodesian National Ballet in performances in Salisbury (now Harare), Bulawayo, and Gwelo (now Gweru). Concurrent with administering such activity, de Villiers began a major outreach to Transvaal schools and the general public. A grant from the provincial Department of Arts and Sciences allowed her to tour two groups of company members (\\"the Midgets\\" and \\"the Giants\\") to perform programs of divertissements and short ballets on stages in school auditoriums and town halls in dorpies on the Highveld and the Bushveld of the vast Transvaal.Grut, \\"De Villiers, Faith,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (1982), p. 372. Among the works presented was Allegro di Concierto (1965), a work evocative of a storm at sea, set by de Villiers to the piano music of Enrique Granados. Besides acting as choreographer, administrator, and impresario, de Villiers was a cheerful \\"mother hen\\" of her company, mindful of the welfare of her dancers and their futures. She was mentor to several South African ballerinas, including Sandra Lipman and Noleen Nicol, who went on to international careers in European companies, and Dawn Weller, who had a decades-long career in PACT Ballet as dancer, artistic director, and prima ballerina.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Weller, Dawn,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). Related activities and awards As chair of the Cecchetti Society of Southern Africa for twenty-five years, and as a senior major examiner on both the national and international circuits, de Villiers was devoted to supporting the Cecchetti method of teaching ballet. Recipient of the Enrico Cecchetti Medal in 1971, she was also honored with the Imperial Medal by the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, London, in recognition of her service to its Cecchetti Branch. She received the Southern African Cecchetti dedication award in 1996 and continued to promote ballet during her close involvement with the Val Whyte Bursary.Gail Myburgh, \\"Faith de Villiers,\\" Cecchetti International Classical Ballet, Pioneers, website, http://www.cicb.org/pioneers.

For many years, she acted as adjudicator, with Dulcie Howes, of the Choreographic Award sponsored by the South African government,Grut, \\"De Villiers, Faith,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (1982), p. 372. Personal life In 1948, de Villiers married Thomas Renwick, an executive with the Otis Elevator Company, with whom she had one child. After both he and she retired, they moved from Johannesburg to Umhlanga Rocks, a seaside community north of Durban (now eThukwini) in KwaZulu-Natal. An avid gardener, a quixotic bridge player, and a steadfast friend to many, she was a woman of optimism, good will, and apparently boundless energy.Lynne Fouch√©, \\"Faith de Villiers,\\" Cecchetti International Classical Ballet, Pioneers, website, http://www.cicb.org/pioneers.

It is about a maid (Vicky Krieps) who, while hiding in people's hotel rooms, happens to spy upon a session between a dominatrix (Lena Lauzemis) and her client (Christian Aumer). It premiered at the Filmfest M√ºnchen on 2 July 2014 and was released in Germany on 28 May 2015. It won two awards at the Montreal World Film Festival, including a FIPRESCI Prize.  Plot  Lynn, a hotel maid, obsessively cleans the rooms, even when they do not have a guest staying in them. After work one day, she follows her manager, Heinz, home. Heinz is surprised to see her and reminds her that their relationship is over. Though she acknowledges this, she initiates sex, which Heinz goes along with. When not cleaning or with Heinz, Lynn watches old French comedies on her laptop and talks to an unnamed psychiatrist. During one of those sessions, it is revealed that she had previously checked herself voluntarily into a mental health clinic. Lynn has a somewhat strained relationship with her mother. When her mother is hospitalized, Lynn briefly visits her and says she is too busy to stay long. While cleaning the rooms, Lynn snoops through guests' belongings and examines their personal effects. After nearly being caught while trying on clothing, she hides under a guest's bed. Instead of sneaking out while the guest showers, she reconsiders and returns to her hiding spot. Lynn continues to secretly observe guests until one day she spots a man, Ludwig, meet a woman, Chiara, in the lobby. Curious, Lynn races ahead of them and hides under the bed before they enter their room. Chiara turns out to be a dominatrix and Ludwig her client. From under the bed, Lynn listens to the sounds of their session. Chiara leaves her business card, and Lynn copies the phone number when Heinz enters the bathroom. When she returns home, Lynn repeatedly slams her hand against her bathtub's rim as she bathes. Lynn calls Chiara and sets up an appointment. After discussing her work, Chiara asks how Lynn got her number. After drinking alcohol, Lynn admits she hid under the bed during Chiara's appointment with Ludwig. After rough foreplay, the two women have sex. As their sessions continue, Lynn becomes less inhibited. Heinz approaches Lynn and says that he has a girlfriend now, and Lynn reacts ambivalently. During another one of Chiara's appointments with Ludwig, Lynn hides under the bed. Chiara drops a pair of handcuffs as a pretext to look under the bed and sees Lynn. After the session, Chiara suggests that she bring a friend to their next session, but Ludwig declines. After a session with Chiara, Lynn suggests that the two take a two-week vacation together. Lynn has already purchased tickets and offers to pay Chiara for her time. Lynn tells her not to respond yet but to think about it. Chiara leaves without saying anything. Lynn waits at the station for Chiara, but, when she eventually gives up, instead visits her mother's house. There, she tells her mother that she is not the person her mother believes her to be. That night, Lynn comes to her mother's bedroom and tells her that the reason she enjoys cleaning is because everything eventually becomes dirty again.

Reception  Director Ingo Haeb said that different audiences have interpreted the film as either a comedy or a sad drama. Ronnie Scheib of Variety compared it to Secretary and Blue is the Warmest Colour, concluding that it is more of a German fable.

It begins along the west side of Roaring River Ridge in the Cascade Range and flows generally north through the Willamette National Forest to meet the larger stream about from its confluence with the McKenzie River. Forest Road 19 (Aufderheide Memorial Drive) runs parallel to Roaring River along its lower reaches and then along its main tributary, McBee Creek. Downstream of McBee Creek, the road crosses the river's other named tributary, Moss Creek. Both creeks enter the main stem from the left.

Generally open from early May to mid-September, it has 12 tent, car, and trailer sites, drinking water, and vault toilets. Roaring River Group Campground, with five sites for group camping, can accommodate up to 30 people at a time. Amenities include picnic tables and vault toilets but no drinking water. The campground is generally open from early May to late October along Forest Road 19 and the lower reach of the river. The Box Canyon Guard Station, near the headwaters of McBee Creek, is a cabin that is generally open for rental from mid-June through the end of October.

He achieved success in the 1980s in the band Sweet Atmosphere co-led with Australian violinist George Washingmachine, playing repertoire of the 1930s and 1940s. He also plays banjo, trumpet. Jazz Ramble states, \\"(Ian) has played all over the world, has made numerous television, radio, festival and concert performances, and is regarded as one of Australia's great guitar players.\\" Biography Ian Date grew up in Byron Bay, a coastal town in northern New South Wales, Australia, later moving to Macksville, a small town halfway between Sydney and Brisbane. His mother was a classically trained pianist and his first instrument was the ukulele and later the guitar. He played with high school bands at age 14 and at age 16, left school to play music professionally and never went back. He became a part of the Sydney jazz scene from the 1970s to the early 2000s where he played in numerous jazz ensembles including the Conway Brothers' \\"Hiccups\\" Orchestra with Jim and Mic Conway, also including his future collaborator the violinist George Washingmachine; in a long lasting band with George Washingmachine called \\"Sweet Atmosphere\\"; plus collaborations with Tom Baker (trumpet), and Ian Cooper (violin) among others. He has appeared on many recordings with other artists including George Golla, Tommy Emmanuel and the harmonica player Brendan Power, and (with his brother Nigel Date) performs as \\"The Date Brothers\\" when he is in Australia. Since 2002 he has been resident in County Cork, Ireland where he lives with his wife Ilse de Ziah, a solo cellist, and their two children, and tours within Ireland, Europe and further afield including at least one return visit to Australia each year. Ian's acoustic guitar (and occasional banjo) repertoire is based firmly on music of the jazz era from the 1920s onwards, with a particular affinity for the virtuoso gypsy jazz style, with excursions to 1950s material and later, and also to elements of classical guitar and world music genres; when playing electric jazz guitar he favours a bebop style owing its origins to the playing of Charlie Christian, Barney Kessel and their successors. In concert, Ian also features his own vocals and trumpet playing, the latter developed mostly over the last 10 years or so. Instruments Ian Date performing at the Lismore Jazz Club, Australia, November 2017 Ian's main acoustic jazz guitar is an original oval-hole Selmer (Maccaferri style) instrument, no. 507, just 4 serial numbers away from Django Reinhardt's main guitar (no. 503) which is now in a museum in Paris. He also owns an earlier D-hole Selmer, no. 142, and in Australia has performed and recorded using one of the last Selmer guitars made, no. 861. When not playing his Selmer guitars he also uses an oval-hole Selmer replica constructed by luthier Piers Crocker in Sydney, New South Wales. For electric work he favours hollowbodies after the style of those manufactured by Gibson.

The album compiles various tracks taken from rare singles, original master tapes, and unreleased material that were previously only made available to few garage rock enthusiasts. It is the first installment of albums related to the Allentown garage rock scene, and was released on Distortions Records on April 15, 2005. The concept of Allentown Anglophile was initiated in April 2002 by Bob Dougherty when he approached the owner of 19th Street Records, Dave Peifley, with recordings of his former Allentown garage band the Kings Ransom, which had a brief brush of fame with their single \\"Shame\\". Peifley was also inspired to seek out original singles, reel-to-reels, and acetate recordings of other Allentown bands, and soon realized there was enough material to configure an entire compilation album. Speaking about the significance of the album, Peifley said, \\"I wanted to make sure that even if we were overlooked commercially, we were not overlooked historically\\". With the assistance of Distortions Records record producer Dave Brown, the raw fidelity of the songs are preserved by digitally mastering the recordings directly from a turntable. Music on the album mostly derives from original material which was influenced by a mix of British Invasion groups, psychedelia, and pop. The Allentown scene was a bustling one, with the bands performing in several teen dance clubs such as the Mad Hatter and the Purple Owl in Allentown, King Arthur's Court outside Quakertown, and the Mod Mill near Center Valley. The Shillings are the most thoroughly represented musical act on Allentown Anglophile with seven of the group's vocally-harmonized pop songs, such as their regional hit, \\"Lying and Trying\\". Another musical highlight includes the Kings Ransom's offering, \\"Without You\\", a psychedelia- driven song influenced by Philadelphia group Mandrake Memorial. Outside the garage scene, D.B.I.L.T.Y. provides an insight into the rise of glam rock in the mid-1970s. The Jay and the Techniques recordings are radio commercial advertisements sponsoring Coca-Cola. In total, 1,000 copies of Allentown Anglophile were originally pressed, and the album is readily available on iTunes.

Many stringers occur without cliffs. A stringer is identified by its lack of vegetative cover. They typically occur in north central Oregon and develop at 900 to 1,100 meter elevations. Lengths can range from only a few meters to over 150 meters, and widths measure from .3 to 3 meters. Depths of the stringers range from 20-65 centimeters. Formation Stone stripes are thought to have been originally created by periglacial conditions of the Quaternary period during an Ice age. It is likely their formation originates from multiple processes including frost action, surface erosion, eluviation, and mass wasting. However, it is likely that intense freeze and thaw cycles account for the natural sorting of the rock debris within a stone stripe, and also accounts for the shallow depth of the stripes, since frost penetration is thought to not penetrate deeper than 1 meter in the region. Stone stripes are also found surrounding soil mounds of central Oregon which also owe their formation to freeze and thaw cycles. They are called stone rings and form on more level terrain. As the terrain increases in slope, stone rings transition into stone stripes. Gallery File:Lava Stringer 4.jpgStone stripes on Catlow Rim with juniper trees.

They began as an R&B-based; rock combo in the vein of the early Rolling Stones called the Druids, but later moved to the West Coast and changed their name to the Druids of Stonehenge, evolving their sound to fit the burgeoning psychedelic rock coming to the fore. In 1968 they recorded the album, Creation, for Uni Records. They broke up in 1969, but have made occasional reunion appearances, such as a performance in New York in 2008. The group formed as the Druids in New York City in 1965. Their original lineup consisted of Dave Budge on lead vocals, Carl Hauser and Billy Tracy on guitars, Tim Workman on bass, and Steve Tindall on drums. Initially the band's repertoire was made up of largely covers done and was stylistically similar to the early Rolling Stones with a strong R&B; orientation. The band went to Nola studios in Manhattan and cut several songs, all covers, such as Bo Diddly's \\"Who Do You Love\\" and \\"Pretty Thing,\\" Screamin' Jay Hawkins' \\"I Put a Spell on You, as well as \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\" and \\"Pretty Thing.\\" Subsequent sessions over the next year produced more covers done in similarly seething fashion, such as \\"I (Who Have Nothing),\\" as well as \\"Bald Headed Woman.\\" The band became fixtures at New York clubs such as Odine's and the Cheetah. The Druids would eventually change their name to the Druids of Stonehenge as their sound began to reflect the influence of psychedelia. In 1968 the newly renamed relocated to the West Coast and signed with Uni Records, a Universal/MCA subsidiary. The band's lineup now included Elliot Randall, who replaced Tracy on guitar. He had previously played with Randall's Island and would go on to play with Seatrain. For Uni they cut the single, \\"A Garden Where Nothing Grows\\" b/w \\"Painted Woman,\\" which reflected the influence of psychedelia. Also released on Uni, they recorded a full-length album entitled Creation, which included their version of Bob Dylan's \\"It's All Over Now Baby Blue,\\" Love's \\"Signed D.C.,\\" as well as an updated rendition of \\"I Put a Spell on You.\\" The album was recorded at two sets of sessions: most of it at TTG Studios in Los Angeles, and the remainder at Nola in New York. The band a television appearance on the Joe Franklin Show at the time of the album's release, performing their rendition of the Rolling Stones' \\"Paint It Black.\\" However, the band did not record any subsequent material and broke up in 1969. They have re-united briefly on several occasions, including a performance in New York in late April 2008. In the intervening years since their breakup, the band as come the attention of garage rock and psychedelic collectors and enthusiasts and their work has been featured on various compilations. Their early recordings (as the Druids) have been re-issued on a mini-disc put out by Sundazed, but titled in keeping with their later moniker, The Druids of Stonehenge. Some of their songs have been included on the Baubles, Vol. 1. compilation. The entire Creation album has been reissued by Sundazed. In 2017 original singer David Budge and guitarist Carl Hauser reformed with lifelong friend and Dylan guitarist Billy Cross, producing an album titled 'Resurrection' that explored the band's roots in historic blues. As the trio got their feet wet with Resurrection they found both old and new magic in its making, and with its strong reception from college blues stations, they decided to not stop there. 2020 will see the release of their first album of all-original material, American Ghosts.

The Republic of Rwanda's Ministry of Youth, Culture, and Sports defines youth as those from age 14 to 35 years. Like many developing countries, Rwanda's population as a whole is quite young. Over 50% of the Rwandan population is under 20 years old and the median age of the population is 22.7 years old. Urban areas of Rwanda have a higher percentage of youth than rural areas, though 80% of young people in Rwanda live in rural areas. Youth constitute over 53% of the population within the capital, Kigali. The youth population in Rwanda grew by 30% from 2002 to 2012. The genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994 destroyed the economy, government, and families. The slaughter of over one million Tutsi and moderate Hutu also had a negative effect on children and vulnerable groups. Youth in Rwanda today represent a generation who were only infants during the genocide or hadn't yet been born. Current President Paul Kagame calls this generation \\"the new Rwanda,\\" alluding to their experiences only living under the post-genocide, Rwandan Patriotic Front government. In order to create a unified narrative of the events of the genocide, the Rwandan government has developed educational and memorial programs. These government programs work to socialize youth with a particular, homogeneous narrative of the genocide in which they did not directly experience. The effects of the genocide continue to impact the lives of all Rwandan people and have had specific impacts on young people's education, health, and family situation. With the destruction of the economic, governmental, and familial systems, an overwhelming majority of Rwandan youth live in poverty and do not pursue education past primary school. The genocide, increased rates of poverty, and death from HIV/AIDS have left over 95,000 Rwandan children and youth orphaned.  Education  Prior to colonization, the Rwandan education system was unstructured. German colonized the country but was quickly replaced by Belgium who redefined many Rwandan systems including education. Catholic missionaries who had arrived in Rwanda earlier than German colonizers had set up some missionary schools to educate Rwandan youth and the Belgian colonizers continued to allow the Church to do educational work. Belgium created schools of their own between 1923 and 1925 but all were closed before 1929. Belgium instead gained indirect control over missionary schools. When Rwanda gained independence in 1962, the new government implemented free and obligatory primary education and kept the colonial system of education intact. Today, the Ministry of Education oversees all public education programs in the country and works \\"to transform the Rwandese citizen into skilled human capital for socio-economic development of the country by ensuring equitable access to quality education focusing on combating illiteracy, promotion of science and technology, critical thinking and positive values.\\" After 1994, public services had to be recreated and re- imagined to work towards the new goals and ideals of Rwanda. The public pre- primary to secondary education system in Rwanda is split into four levels, followed by higher education. Preprimary education enrollment remains small but is growing for children 3‚Äì6 years old. Primary education serves students from 7-12 for a 6-year cycle. Tronc cummon, a three-year extension of fee-free basic education, acts as a lower division secondary education. Upper secondary education requires a fee and a test for admission immediately after the conclusion of tronc cummon. 60 percent of upper secondary schools are boarding schools. Following upper secondary school, students complete the A-level examination that determines a students ability and qualifications to attend universities and other post-secondary institutions. Rwanda has unified their public higher education system as the University of Rwanda and private higher education institutions have been developed and grown.  UN Millennium Development Goals  Rwanda signed on to and strives to meet the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG). The same number of boys and girls enroll in primary school, reaching the MDG for gender parity in primary. Income disparity still remains an issue within the education system. Rwanda reflects the goals of the MDG by emphasizing education's ability to reduce poverty and promote economic development and sustainability. MDG focus on reaching 100% literacy rate. 84.6% of 15-19 year olds and 79.9% of 19-25 year olds are literate. Two aspects of the MDG look at the initial enrollment in primary school and completion of the educational cycle. 98% of adolescents enroll in primary school at some time in Rwanda. The majority of students do not remain enrolled in school until completion in Rwanda.  Enrollment and retention rates  From 1998 to 2009, enrollment in primary school almost doubled, with the introduction of fee-free basic education in 2003. By 2008 almost 2.2 million students were enrolled in primary school. While primary school increased at an annual rate of 5.4, during the same period upper secondary school increased at a rate of 11 percent. The retention rate from primary to secondary has decreased over time. 42% of students entering primary school in 2002 completed school through upper secondary, whereas less than one third are expected to do so from students who entered primary school in 2008. 85% of students entering tronc commun, complete the end of upper secondary school. Income disparity and gender disparity play a role in students not completing the education cycle. Students in the top 20 percent of wealth in Rwanda are eight times more likely to complete the education cycle than students in the bottom 20 percent of wealth. Direct costs of basic education and the school fees required for upper secondary education make it difficult for students from poor families and/or youth headed households to continue through the education system. The OLevel examination, taken at the end of tronc commun, determines a students enrollment in upper secondary education. Young men are more likely than young women to pass the OLevel examination and enroll in upper secondary education. Higher education has seen an increase in enrollment with an annual rate of growth of 19 percent between 1999 and 2008. Young women represent 42 percent of higher education students.  Health  The probability of death for males and females before reaching 15 years old is 23% and 19%, respectively. Youth, in general, experience much of the same health problems as adults in Rwanda. Communicable, or infectious, diseases constitute 90% of health complaints. Malaria remains the highest risk of mortality in Rwanda but has seen a sharp decline in cases and mortality. Between 2001 and 2007, malaria's lethality fell from 10.1% to 2%. Smoking and other forms of tobacco use is increasing within the country for young people. 24% of secondary students smoked in 2004 according to a World Health Organization survey. 12.3% of children from 13‚Äì15 years old smoked in 2008. Hospitals and health clinics have recorded an increase in patients admitted for tobacco related illness and abuse.  Sexual health  The HIV prevalence in Rwanda is 3 percent of the population between 15‚Äì49 years old. Youth in urban areas are more likely to contract HIV with the prevalence of HIV in urban areas at 7.3 percent versus 2.2 percent in rural areas. Urban young women, aged 15‚Äì24, have a prevalence of 3.9 percent, whereas young men have a prevalence of 1.1 percent. One sixth of young people in Rwanda are considered vulnerable because of HIV's effect on their lives. The Rwandan government focuses attention of youth health initiatives on reproductive and sexual health. Young people get the most information on sexual health education programs and initiatives from the radio. Most youth education programs on HIV/AIDS focus on abstinence-only and do not stress the importance of condom use. The sexual activity of Rwandan youth reflect the low-level of education on condom use. Approximately 20 percent of Rwandan youth between 20-24 admit to having sexual intercourse before 18 years old. Sexual activity is more prevalent among women in low wealth households and among both male and female youth headed households. Condom use is less prevalent in those same youth versus the general population. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) available in the country allows HIV-infected individuals to continue to live within dating and sexual relationships into adulthood. Findings on whether or not young people living with HIV/AIDS document more or less high-risk sexual behaviors than those living without HIV/AIDS are inconclusive. Rwanda's large population of orphans and high-risk youth are more vulnerable to transactional sex. These forms of sex are associated with a higher risk of HIV. Transactional sex is common in sub-Saharan Africa for youth in expanding economies in order to ensure their survival. The Ministry of Youth is working to eliminate the problem of transactional sex with the \\"Singurisha\\" (I am not for sale) campaign by educating businesses, churches, and other officials about the community's responsibility to address the issue.  Orphans and vulnerable youth  The genocide has had a lasting effect on families within Rwanda. Government and private orphanages and other orphan systems were demolished during the course of the genocide and the killings themselves left an estimated ten percent of children aged 0‚Äì18 years old as orphans. About 10 percent of households, or 65,000 households, in Rwanda are now youth headed households. Over 300,000 children are living within such households with 90 percent being headed by girls. Youth headed households place young girls at a higher risk of sexual exploitation and transactional sex. Orphans in Rwanda feel stigmatized and unsupported in their communities due to their possible relationship to HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS remains stigmatized in Rwanda and so orphans who have lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS are seen as unclean. Also, some orphans from the genocide are children of perpetrators or extremist Hutus and they are disadvantaged because of their parents' pasts. Orphans are perceived as troublemakers and irresponsible within Rwanda. During and after the genocide, issues of trust came to light within the country and have continued to limit certain relationships. Children with parents and children without parents are an example of continued division within Rwanda. Due to the stigma associated with them, orphans find little support within their communities. Pervasive poverty reduces some community's ability to support orphans or youth held households. With little support, issues of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress remain unfixed and are perpetuated. Young women are especially vulnerable with less potential contact with family or a caring adult than young men, leaving them more vulnerable for sexual abuse. A vulnerable young person is not necessarily an orphan. 80 percent of rural youth are considered vulnerable in Rwanda. Vulnerable youth often migrate to Kigali with the hope of economic prosperity but have little opportunity or support within the urban setting to gain sustainable occupation. Vulnerable urban youth often live day to day in unstable and insecure situations.  Transitions to adulthood  The traditional method for young men to transition to adulthood in Rwanda is through marriage. Before marriage, a young man must build a house for his future family. The Rwandan government has created regulations that define how and where new housing must be built. The Rwandan government calls the new community housing projects imidugudus. Imidugudus are villages where multiple families live within an area; different from the traditional rugo which were family compounds on a farmer's land. The government has strict regulations on how the houses must be built and young men are struggling to build them at all. A large obstacle for young men is the acquisition of roof tiles which are necessary for building a house and expensive in Rwanda. Young men search for opportunities for employment in order to provide for the roof tiles and other material for the house and often travel to large farms or Kigali out of desperation. Young men in Kigali struggle to find the employment they are in need of and must deal with the possibility of not reaching traditional adulthood. Rwandan law prohibits marriage before twenty one years of age. Female youth, especially in rural Rwanda, are perceived as too old once they reach twenty-five years old. Female youth too do not reach female adulthood until after marriage. 12 percent of female youth may never be married and reach female adulthood due to having more women than men in Rwanda.

Ed Kumacheva's work focuses on polymer science, nanoscience, microfluidics, and interface chemistry. She has a strong effort in biomimetic research focused biological tissues, fluids, and environments with polymers and nanomaterials. Kumacheva has been involved with important developments in modeling the biological conditions of myocardial infarctions, strokes, pulmonary embolism, and various other blood related disorders or health conditions using polymers and nano-materials. Some of this work is related to mimicking blood vessels in order to gain a greater understanding of the chemistry and physics involved in blood clots. Kumacheva has been involved in research exploring the potential of microbubbles, a gas enclosed by a natural or synthetic polymer for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications such as targeted drug delivery and molecular imaging. An additional medical application of Kumacheva's work is the creation of hydrogels and various other chemical environments to either support the life of a stem cell, affect necrotic heart tissue as well as deter the metastasis of cancer cells. Kumacheva has been involved in research involving cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and fluorescent latex nanoparticles (NPs), as well as self-assembling nanocubes.  Quantifying the efficiency of CO‚ÇÇ capture The mechanism by which the Lewis pair binds CO‚ÇÇ in solution. The amount of conjugated Lewis pairs can be measured and reflects the quantity of CO‚ÇÇ in solution. Inside oscillatory microfluidic tube, the Switchable Hydrophilicity Solvent (SHS) - in this case DBAE - being protonated and becoming hydrophilic. The hydrophilic state contains bound CO‚ÇÇ. Much of her work relates to climate change and lowering CO‚ÇÇ levels. She has collaborated with Doug Stephan (University of Toronto), to investigate the behavior of frustrated Lewis pairs used to separate various elements of natural gas; namely, ethylene from a mixture of ethylene and methane. This work has great industrial importance due to the need for efficient and precise separation of petroleum compounds in various industries.  Study of Extraction  In another study involving frustrated Lewis pairs, Kumacheva used them to quantify the efficiency of binding CO‚ÇÇ emissions. Measuring the amount of CO‚ÇÇ bound by the Lewis pairs provided information on the amount that was captured into solution. Some of the reactions in CO‚ÇÇ uptake require solvents with different properties, but it is expensive to prepare multiple solvents. As a solution to this problem, Kumacheva has worked on solvents with adjustable properties such as hydrophilicity called switchable hydrophilicity solvents (SHS). For example, a sterically hindered, large, hydrophobic molecule (Dibutylethanol Amine ‚Äì DBAE) being protonated to become hydrophilic as necessitated by the reaction process.

The victim has been linked to regions in Massachusetts and New York. Various investigations have been conducted in the case. Recent developments have indicated she was possibly a teenage immigrant from Central or South America who had lived in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, although the family of the individual has yet to be located. In 2016, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released the detail that she may have used the names \\"Jasmine\\" or \\"Jassy\\" when alive. Despite extensive efforts, her body has never been identified. The murderer, or murderers, have never been apprehended. Discovery of the body On September 12, 1976, at 10:20 a.m., the body of a 15- to 30-year-old woman was found partially wrapped in a white sheet. She had been beaten, strangled, and raped. The rape had been severe, as it caused bleeding that had seeped into her clothing. She likely died at a different location and had been transported to the side of Dogwood Road near the back gate of a cemetery. It is possible that a Ford Econoline van may be linked to the case, as one was seen near the location of the body an hour before it was found. The victim wore a turquoise-colored stone bead tied to a rawhide string as a necklace. Also in her possession were two brass keys (one believed to be for a house and the other for a \\"night latch\\") that were found attached to a safety pin in one of the pockets of a pair of tan-yellow jeans. She wore a white and tan shirt, a white bra, and distinctive knee-high socks with multi-colored stripes. A single, light tan moccasin with twine laces and a rubber sole was found near the body; it is believed to have been worn by the victim. Other pieces of cloth were also found on the body. Two bandannas and a bag for grass seeds were found over her face. These had been fastened behind her neck in a square knot. One bandanna was blue and white, and the other was orange and white. The orange-and-white bandanna was found to have holes cut in it to fit the locations of her eyes and nose. Besides the bag over her face, a piece of the grass seed bag was found in her throat. This was determined to have been the cause of her death, along with ligature strangulation. The bag read \\"Farm Bureau Association Grass Seed, Lexington, Mass.\\" Additionally, the hands had been bound behind her back with some sort of \\"bandage\\" in noticeably high- quality knots. An extremely large amount of a sedative drug, chlorpromazine, was found in the victim's stomach. Chlorpromazine is used to treat schizophrenia, which led to a theory linking the victim, or those responsible for her murder, to a mental institution. Additionally, the sheet that was wrapped around her body was consistent with those provided at inpatient institutions. Examination Tattoo found on the victim's right shoulder, possibly representing Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. Examiners measured the victim and concluded that she weighed between 149 and 159 pounds and was 5 feet 6 to 5 feet 9 inches tall. The blood type of the victim was determined to be O positive. There had been evidence that she had been treated by a dentist. The victim had three of her molars removed and had fillings in the remaining five. Because of the amount and quality of the dental care, authorities surmised that she did not come from a background of poverty. One of her other teeth was crooked. A poorly tattooed pair of letters, possibly initials, was found on her left arm. It contained two letters, believed to be JP, SS, JB or a similar letter combination. She had her ears pierced and a scar on her upper right thigh. A widow's peak was noted on the victim's forehead. She had dark brown to black, shoulder-length hair with a wavy texture and brown eyes. She had a dark olive complexion. The exact race and ethnicity of the victim puzzled investigators and medical examiners, but it is believed that she may have been white. Investigation A reconstruction of Woodlawn Jane Doe. Shortly after the body was found, fingerprint and dental information were collected to establish its identity. Her fingerprints were added to national databases, as well as her dental chart. Yet no match has ever been made. Many missing women from across the United States have since been eliminated as possible identities for Woodlawn Jane Doe. The county police department currently offers a cash reward of two thousand dollars for information about this case. A notable case was that of Maria \\"Mia\\" Anjiras, a teen that had run away from her Connecticut home in February 1976. The victim's face has been reconstructed multiple times for release to the public. Three versions exist that were rendered by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Other of her sketches also exist. The local police department provided an age- regression and an additional reconstruction, created by Eve Grant, hoping to provide an estimation of her appearance at a younger age (in case she was \\"a runaway\\" or someone knew her at an earlier period of her life). One of the keys which the victim carried was made in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and had \\"DB09212\\" stamped onto it. The grass seed bag was connected to a factory in Buffalo, New York. It had been sold exclusively in the Massachusetts cities of Waltham, Rochdale, Lowell, South Weymouth, and Greenfield. Years before the murder, production of this type of bag had been halted. Forensic pollen analysis of the items found with the body indicated she had spent time in a populous area, such as Boston, Massachusetts, or New York, New York. These results were aided by the detection of cedar and hemlock pollen, which possibly originated from a site such as the New York Botanical Garden or Harvard University. The case has been featured on America's Most Wanted. Leads were processed but did not lead to the victim's identity or to that of her killer or killers. A break in the case was announced in December 2015 by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children after the Baltimore County police received a tip. A suitable match was discovered, being described as a Puerto Rican or Colombian teenager that had moved to Boston, Massachusetts with her parents and as many as five siblings. The explanation for the tattoo of \\"JP\\" on her arm was announced to possibly be the initials for a part of the city, known as \\"Jamaica Plain\\" where the possible match lived, on \\"Forbes Street.\\" Potential school locations were also included. The department has had difficulties finding the relatives of the girl, putting the investigation on hold. On the 40th anniversary of her discovery, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released an updated reconstruction of the victim.

The 16th-century mosque was one of the few surviving remnants of what used to be the port city of Banten, the most prosperous trading center in the Indonesian archipelago after the fall of Demak Sultanate in mid-16th century. History This sketch shows from right to left: the Mughal style minaret, the Javanese style mosque, and the Dutch style tiyamah. The Great Mosque of Banten shows eclectic design, a proof of the international influence in Banten at the time of its construction. The mosque was constructed in Javanese style during the reign of Sultan Maulana Yusuf, the third Sultan of Banten Sultanate, in Dzulhijjah 966 (1566 ). A Javanese-styled pawestren (side hall, used for female's praying hall) was added during the reign of Maulana Muhammad (1580-1586). The southern serambi (porch) of the mosque was converted into a tomb containing about 15 graves. In 1632, a 24-meter minaret was added to the mosque complex. The minaret was designed by a Chineseman Cek-ban-cut. Around similar period the Dutch-styled tiyamah was added to the mosque following the design of Hendrik Lucaasz Cardeel, a Dutchman who was converted to Islam. Architecture In a typical architecture of Javanese mosque, the Great Mosque of Banten consists of the main prayer hall and a covered veranda (serambi). The serambi is a semi-attached porch-like structure which provides entrance to the main prayer hall. The main prayer features a five-tiered roof supported by four main posts (saka guru). The three uppermost tier is arranged rather uniquely, appearing more like a Chinese pagoda than the regular multi-tiered roof of Javanese architecture. There is a dispute over the original number of the tiers of the main prayer hall; sketches of the city in 1596, 1624, 1661 and 1726 shows the number of the tier as not more than three tiers, while Valentijn (1858) mentioned the number of the tier is five as it is today. The covered verandas were added to the main mosque building, built in the north and south side of the mosque. Being a port town, the Great Mosque of Banten features eclectic elements, which appear in the overall enclosed space of the mosque, the minaret, and the tiyamah building. The minaret is a popular icon of the Great Mosque of Banten. It is a 24 meter high, brick minaret, with a 10 meter in diameter octagonal base. The shape is reminiscent of a lighthouse. The architecture features a mix of Indian Mughal pattern and ancient candi decoration. Beside the mosque is a two-floored building built in the 17th- century Dutch style. This building, known as the tiyamah, was erected at the order of Sultan Haji of Banten and designed by a Dutchman, Hendrik Lucaasz Cardeel. Cardeel converted to Islam, became a member of the Banten court with the title Pangeran Wiraguna, and designed this building which now stands on the southwest side of the Great Mosque. It is still used as a center for Islamic study. There are several tombs in the mosque complex, such as the tomb of Sultan Maulana Hasanuddin and his wife, Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa and Sultan Abu Nasir Abdul Qohhar.

He served as the President of the Mutual Life Insurance Company from 1885 to 1906, when he retired in the wake of a corporate scandal. Early life Richard Aldrich McCurdy was born on January 29, 1835 in New York City. His father, Robert Henry McCurdy, was a prominent New York City businessman. His mother, Gertrude Mercer Lee, was the niece of Theodore Frelinghuysen, a United States Senator and former vice presidential candidate. McCurdy was of Scotch Irish descent on his paternal side; as early as 1503, King James VI leased the vast majority of the Isle of Bute to the MacKurerdy family (later McCurdy). His paternal great-grandfather, John McCurdy, emigrated to the United States from Ireland prior to the Declaration of Independence. His paternal uncle, Charles J. McCurdy, served as the United States Charg√© to the Austrian Empire from 1850 to 1852. McCurdy received a law degree from the Harvard Law School in 1856. Career McCurdy was practised law with William Betts Jr., and Lucius Robinson, who served as the 26th Governor of New York from 1877 to 1879. McCurdy became legal counsel to the Mutual Life Insurance Company from 1860 to 1865. He became its vice president in 1865. He served as its President from 1885 to 1906. Under his leadership, the Mutual Life Insurance Company Building was built in Manhattan; according to John N. Ingham, \\"it was at that time the largest office structure in the world.\\" Moreover, \\"the assets of Mutual Life grew from $103,627,812 to $476,861,165\\" from 1883 to 1903. However, McCurdy and other Mutual Life executives were accused of misappropriation of the company assets. By 1905, McCurdy was questioned over the salary his son received from the company. He retired in this midst of the scandal, in 1906. When the newly formed Mutual Alliance Trust Company opened for business in New York on the Tuesday after June 29, 1902, there were 13 directors, including Emanuel Lehman, William Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and McCurdy. Additionally, McCurdy served as the President of the Bell Telephone Company. He also served as vice president and director of the Western National Bank of the United States in New York. Moreover, he served on the Board of Directors of the United States Mortgage & Trust Company. Personal life McCurdy married Sarah Ellen Little, daughter of Charles Coffin Little, on 22 October 1856. They had two children, Robert H. McCurdy (who married Mary Suckley), and Gertrude Lee McCurdy (who married Louis A. Thebaud). They resided on lower Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, until they moved to a mansion Morris Plains, New Jersey, followed by another mansion in Morristown, New Jersey. McCurdy's sister Gertrude married Gardiner Greene Hubbard, the first president of the Bell Telephone Company and a founder of the National Geographic Society. McCurdy was thus the uncle of their daughter, Mabel Gardiner Hubbard, who married Alexander Graham Bell. McCurdy was a member of the Metropolitan Club, the Union League Club of New York, the Manhattan Club, the Manhattan Club (social club) and the Lawyer's Club. He was also a member of the New England Society of New York and the American Museum of Natural History. Death McCurdy died on March 6, 1916 in Morristown, New Jersey. He was eighty-one years old. His portrait, painted by John Singer Sargent in 1890, is in the collection of the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park, Florida. His photograph, taken by Ira W. Martin in 1890, is in the collection of the Frick Collection on the Upper East Side of New York City.

It contests the proposition that the universe cannot exist without a creator by asserting that the creator of the universe must have the same restrictions. This, in turn, may lead to a problem of infinite regress wherein each newly presumed creator of a creator is itself presumed to have its own creator. A common challenge to theistic propositions of a creator deity as a necessary first-cause explanation for the universe is the question: \\"Who created God?\\".The God Book, Michael Arnheim, 2015, p. 18. Some faith traditions have such an element as part of their doctrine. Jainism posits that the universe is eternal and has always existed. Ismailism rejects the idea of God as the first cause, due to the doctrine of God's incomparability and source of any existence including abstract objects.Arzina R.

Originally owned by Bob Jones and branded Robert Jones House by him, it was commonly referred to as Bob Jones Tower, but some called it Bob's Folly. In the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, its staircases collapsed, trapping the occupants. The building reopened in July 2017 as the city's Crowne Plaza hotel. History The original building on the location was the Golden Fleece Hotel, built in 1851. The 1980s high- rise was a property speculation by Paynter Developments, who engaged Christchurch architecture firm Warren and Mahoney for the architectural design, and Holmes Consulting Group as structural engineers. Fletcher Construction was the contractor for the project. The building was finished in mid-1989 and sold to Robert Jones Investments (Canterbury), a company owned by Bob Jones. Jones, a property developer who had survived the 1987 stock market crash, named the building Robert Jones House and put the initials \\"RJI\\" of his investment company on the building. Jones had a high public profile, as he had set up the New Zealand Party just prior to the to oppose Robert Muldoon, but the effect of this was that the conservative vote was split, and the Labour Party won the election, and David Lange formed the Fourth Labour Government. The building was commonly referred to as Bob Jones Tower, but some called it Bob's Folly in relation to his 1984 election interference. The building was later sold and named for New Zealand investment banking firm Forsyth Barr. Built with 17 storeys, the structure was at the time Christchurch's second tallest building at , after the 1986 Hotel Grand Chancellor at . Two further high rises overtook the Forsyth Barr House over time, first the PricewaterhouseCoopers building in 1990 at , and then the Pacific Tower in 2010 at . It was an unusual design for Warren and Mahoney, who had until then worked with exposed concrete beams that showed the structure of buildings, but chose a glass curtain wall design with aluminium panels that hid the structure. This construction system became the norm for office buildings for the next two decades based on construction techniques pioneered in Christchurch. According to historian Geoffrey Rice, many architects regard this building as Warren and Mahoney's \\"ugly duckling\\", and Paul Walker, professor of architecture at the University of Melbourne, asks: \\"Does anyone love the monolithic Forsyth Barr building on Colombo Street...?\\" In 2008, the Forsyth Barr Building was one of three A-grade office buildings in central Christchurch; the others were the PricewaterhouseCoopers Building, and the Clarendon Tower. 2011 Christchurch earthquake John Kirk-Anderson's photo of a person being abseiled from the Forsyth Barr Building became one of the enduring photos of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake The building's land highlighted in yellow within the designation of the Performing Arts Precinct After the September 11 attacks in 2001, emergency supplies for an evacuation of this high-rise were installed, including ropes, sledge hammers, and axes. In the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the staircases in Forsyth Barr House collapsed, trapping the occupants. One of the trapped occupants, a trained mountain guide with experience in mountain rescue, had windows broken and abseiled people onto an adjacent car parking building. The photo of one of the occupants being abseiled along the glass fa√ßade, taken by The Press photographer John Kirk-Anderson, is one of the enduring images of that earthquake. Search of the building was technically difficult for urban search and rescue (USAR) teams, requiring the deconstruction of 4-tonne stair sets, but the building was cleared with no victims discovered. The Hotel Grand Chancellor and PricewaterhouseCoopers were both demolished subsequent to the earthquake, hence the Forsyth Barr Building is once more Christchurch's second tallest building. Until mid-2013, it was unclear whether the Forsyth Barr Building would also be demolished, or whether it was economic to repair it. Subsequent to the earthquakes, the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) developed a Christchurch Central Recovery Plan. Almost two city blocks were designated for the Performing Arts Precinct, including the land that the Forsyth Barr Building was located on. This meant that The Crown could have compulsorily acquired the land from its owners if it wanted to go ahead with the Performing Arts Precinct. The designation was later lifted and the size of the Performing Arts Precinct designation reduced after Christchurch City Council had decided to restore the existing Christchurch Town Hall instead of building a new one within this precinct. Conversion to hotel The earthquake-damaged building was sold in an \\"as is, where is\\" state for NZ$8 million. In December 2014, it was revealed that the building will be leased to the Crowne Plaza chain for a hotel, replacing the former Crowne Plaza hotel that stood diagonally opposite across Victoria Square prior to the earthquakes. In late 2015, new staircases were installed. The new hotel opened on 1 July 2017, offering 204 rooms.

This is measured by the health indicators of daily activities and physical movement. Defining disability differs according to legal contexts of different environments and levels of vulnerability. Brazil is one of the heaviest populated countries in the world and is the largest country in South America, with a population of 212.56 million people in 2020. Due to population rates, there is approximately 16 million people in Brazil with a disability. Of this, 9 million of these are of working age, and 1 million are in the labor force. In Brazil, disability is measured by facts and age-based data, sport participation, education information, impacts on everyday life and available support services/issues of access. 260x260px  Facts = Statistics  Types of disabilities and their symbols There are many types of disabilities in Brazil. Disability can occur physically, through head injuries, vision impairments, hearing impairments, cognitively, learning manners, psychologically or invisibly. In Brazil, approximately 34% of adults are impacted by disabilities that affect functional living patterns. Men represent higher statistics over women by 1.3%. Strokes and mental disorders are common in Brazil and can lead to individuals attaining a disability. Each individual experiences disability differently, whereby some are static, others are progressive and seriousness levels vary. In Brazil, individuals who maintain a low education and aged persons are more vulnerable to disabilities, therefore attaining incapacities at higher rates. Having a high education enforces health advantages through the promotion of health material and current health data, allowing for individuals to live a healthy lifestyle and seek medical assistance when necessary Encountering a functional disability as a Brazilian adult is common although it disadvantages individuals as many do not attend education institutions, are not likely to complete an educational course and may lack literacy abilities.  Age groups  The chance of attaining a disability in Brazil grows as an individual gets older. Developing a disability can occur through old age, as vulnerability appears and the risk of getting sick or receiving a chronic disease is high. The risk increases once individuals reach age 40, and visual disabilities are most common. Throughout a lifespan, if individuals are exposed to poverty or unhealthy conditions, developing a disability can occur earlier.  Sport = Participation  In Brazil, individuals of any gender who encounter differing levels of disabilities are able to participate in sport. Sports available for people with disabilities include dance, swimming, tennis, bike riding, horse riding, water sports, basketball, contact sports and a variety of athletic activities. The late 20th century has brought sporting changes in Brazil which have enabled people with disabilities to feel included, as they are able to form individuality through participating in the Paralympics and other sporting groups. An example of this is through Brazilian dance practices, where individuals can participate in choreography and are able to use their disability as a stance of creativity.  Potential barriers  Individuals with disabilities in Brazil face barriers when anticipating participation in sport. Brazilian individuals with disabilities face varying levels of societal pressure, as they must prove their sporting activity is possible. Individuals with disabilities may encounter a low self-esteem when participating in sporting events, through the belief that participation entirety is not possible. There are limited sporting amenities for Brazilian people with disabilities, which can create individual pressure. Differing sports conducted by Brazilian individuals with disabilities are frowned upon, and many athletes face notoriety for their sporting movements. There is a lack of accessibility within Brazilian city structures, which forms difficulties in accessing sporting activities.  Overcoming barriers  The Rio de Janeiro 2016 Paralympics logo There are ways for individuals with disabilities in Brazil to overcome sport barriers. An example of this is holding internal strength while participating in sport, which enables a voice and creates possibilities. At least five major associations work to enable the participation of Brazilians with disabilities in sport. There are organisations in Brazil that aim to enable every sport for individuals with disabilities, including the ‚ÄòBrazilian Sporting Association for Amputees‚Äô and ‚ÄòBrazilian Wheelchair Sporting Association‚Äô. ‚ÄòSport for All‚Äô is an Olympic created initiative that was brought into Brazil to make sport easily accessible to all individuals. The 2016 Paralympics were held in Rio de Janeiro and encouraged government movements for individuals with disabilities in sports, including the introduction of more sport facilities, sport encouragement and mobility ease within communities. Local governments in Brazil are assisting individuals with disabilities to recognise potential levels and encourage activity, due to Brazil being a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, having signed the treaty on 30 March 2007 and ratified it on 1 August 2008. Brazil's Law 7853 criminalizes discrimination based on disability, and other legal protections also exist.  Education = History  In Brazil, attending an education institution is a human right. Students with disabilities are challenged when seeking education access. This is because of Brazil‚Äôs past of the rejection of foreign information and knowledge because of language blockages and location. In 1600s Brazil, special education was recognised through a school for children with physical disabilities, and in the 1800s, the first school for children who were deaf was created. In 1800s Brazil, there was no other record of official caring for people with disabilities. Catholic organisations cared for individuals with learning disabilities as they were abandoned. An inclusion policy for children with disabilities in Brazil was implemented in 1989 to seek social inclusion and enhance wellbeing in schools. Educators and government officials did not advocate for children with disabilities seeking education, parents, friends, and psychologists did.  Potential barriers  Individuals with disabilities are challenged when seeking education in Brazil, as they do not receive education assistance. Students with disabilities receive no special considerations in the classroom. In Brazil, there are two education systems, one for students with special needs and one for students without special needs. Education classes held for students with disabilities are provided in Portuguese only, and academic learning faces difficulties, as no grading takes place. Testing students with disabilities in classrooms does not occur, a group will determine skills and improvement. Teachers lack disability training which decreases education quality. Low government funding for the education of individuals with disabilities has led to low quality institutions. Remote and rural areas lack facilities for students with disabilities.  Overcoming barriers  Education barriers are being overcome as Brazil is developing and forming a major economy. Brazilian law states that children with disabilities have the right to be integrated into education institutions. Local, regional, and national parents and psychologists have negotiated with Brazilian officials for the complete integration of their children with disabilities into education systems. An example of this is the ‚ÄòAssociation of Parents and Friends of the Exceptional‚Äô which fundraise money for individuals with learning disabilities on a non-profit basis to assist with health and integration into education systems. Advocacy and support has led people with disabilities to form their own communities and promote their own rights. The Brazilian adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2008, and the instigation of the Statute of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2015, enabled legality for people with disabilities in education. Private schools in Brazil have recognised students with disabilities and their need for individual facilities, integrating this into physical and psychological learning environments. Through non-profit funding, schools of students with disabilities have adopted a general curriculum.  Everyday life impacts = Life normality  Physical disability symbol People with disabilities in Brazil have a different lifestyle compared to those without a disability, where lifestyles can be disrupted on a daily basis. Life normality for many Brazilian individuals with disabilities includes the encouragement of independence and self-sufficiency within the daily departments of housing and family, health, and communication. Many individuals who have a disability struggle with at least one daily activity, including dressing and transfers. Difficulty in everyday life activities is escalated by the factors of age, education, and chronic disease levels. Life normality and challenges for people with disabilities in Brazil originates from history and struggles with forced labour.  Housing and family  In Brazil, people with disabilities are socially impacted through where they live and who they live with, determining independence levels. Individuals with disabilities are likely to live with family, regardless of children or marriage, due to economic reasons and familial values of protection. In Brazil, care occurs informally by family and females. Families give up studying and working to provide free care.  Health  Health levels vary through the number of chronic diseases encountered and age, which impacts everyday life. Chronic diseases in individuals with disabilities grow with age. Individuals with disabilities in Brazil are prone to illness and chronic diseases, and frequently require professional health assistance. There are issues of access when seeking professional health assistance for people with disabilities, through service location, finances and service opening times. Persons with physical disabilities have higher difficulty levels of seeking health assistance due to physical environments and transportation.  Learning and communicating  Learning and communicating varies in everyday life, due to education sections of Brazilian legislation. Higher educated individuals have lower levels of difficulty communicating in daily life and participating in daily activities. Schools and education services can lack the recognition of disability types and social inclusion. Legal support in legislation lacks for individuals with communication disorders, lowering social inclusion rates.  Support services and access issues = Support services  Guide dog to assist individuals with visual impairments Braille for individuals with visual impairments There are support services and organisations available for people with disabilities in Brazil, which aim to fulfil assistance lacking by the Brazilian government. There are non- government organisations who aim to advocate the rights of people with disabilities and educate individuals with disabilities of their rights in the country. This has encouraged individuals with disabilities to self-advocate and participate in social movements to promote democracy. There are civil and human rights organisations in Brazil who advocate for people with disabilities to create public concerns. In major cities, physical assistance is available for people with disabilities, such as provision of guide dogs, staff at train stations, and set seating in public transport. In S√£o Paulo, building elevators have Braille buttons and resources for hearing incapacities. There is a transport service available for individuals with severe disabilities in S√£o Paulo, to prevent difficulties on public transport.  Issues of access and success  Individuals with disabilities have issues utilising support services due to issues of access and success. A disability non-government organisation must form networks with other organisations to be heard by government officials. There are public policies to promote disability awareness, with economic plans taking priority over respect to individuals with disabilities. There are perceptions of individuals with disabilities in Brazil, limiting disability organisations success rate. In Brazil, physical support services lack. An example of this are the staff who aid public transport that do not receive specific training, access ramps lack sufficiency, and dedicated lanes on the road for sight disabilities are incomplete. Throughout the country, road crossings are silent and use visuals only. References ","title":"Disability in Brazil"},{"id":"48611039","text":"Chionellidea is a moth genus in the family Autostichidae.

Definition The most popular axiomatic set theories, Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory (ZFC), von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del set theory (NBG), and Morse‚ÄìKelley set theory (MK), admit non-conservative extensions that arise after adding a supplementary axiom of existence of a Grothendieck universe U. An example of such an extension is the Tarski‚ÄìGrothendieck set theory, where an infinite hierarchy of Grothendieck universes is postulated. The concept of conglomerate was created to deal with \\"collections\\" of classes, which is desirable in category theory so that each class can be considered as an element of a \\"more general collection\\", a conglomerate. Technically this is organized by changes in terminology: when a Grothendieck universe U is added to the chosen axiomatic set theory (ZFC/NBG/MK) it is considered convenient * to apply the term \\"set\\" only to elements of U, * to apply the term \\"class\\" only to subsets of U, * to apply the term \\"conglomerate\\" to all sets (not necessary elements or subsets of U). As a result, in this terminology, each set is a class, and each class is a conglomerate. Corollaries Formally this construction describes a model of the initial axiomatic set theory (ZFC/NBG/MK) in the extension of this theory (\\"ZFC/NBG/MK+Grothendieck universe\\") with U as the universe. If the initial axiomatic set theory admits the idea of proper class (i.e. an object that can't be an element of any other object, like the class Set of all sets in NBG and in MK), then these objects (proper classes) are discarded from the consideration in the new theory (\\"NBG/MK+Grothendieck universe\\"). However, (not counting the possible problems caused by the supplementary axiom of existence of U) this in some sense does not lead to a loss of information about objects of the old theory (NBG or MK) since its representation as a model in the new theory (\\"NBG/MK+Grothendieck universe\\") means that what can be proved in NBG/MK about its usual objects called classes (including proper classes) can be proved as well in \\"NBG/MK+Grothendieck universe\\" about its classes (i.e. about subsets of U, including subsets that are not elements of U, which are analogs of proper classes from NBG/MK). At the same time, the new theory is not equivalent to the initial one, since some extra propositions about classes can be proved in \\"NBG/MK+Grothendieck universe\\" but not in NBG/MK. Terminology The change in terminology is sometimes called \\"conglomerate convention\\". The first step, made by Mac Lane, is to apply the term \\"class\\" only to subsets of U. Mac Lane does not redefine existing set-theoretic terms; rather, he works in a set theory without classes (ZFC, not NBG/MK), calls members of U \\"small sets\\", and states that the small sets and the classes satisfy the axioms of NBG. He does not need \\"conglomerates\\", since sets need not be small. The term \\"conglomerate\\" lurks in reviews of 1970th and 1980th on Mathematical ReviewsReviews 48#5965, 56#3798, 82f:18003, 83d:18010, 84c:54045, 87m:18001 without definition, explanation or reference, and sometimes in papers.Reviewed: 89e:18002, 96g:18002 While the conglomerate convention is in force, it must be used exclusively in order to avoid ambiguity; that is, conglomerates should not be called ‚Äúsets‚Äù in the usual fashion of ZFC.

Kim was considered the best first basemen in the KBO from 1985 to 1991, winning the KBO League Golden Glove Award every year at that position. His Haitai Tigers won seven Korean Series titles with him as a player. Kim attended Dongguk University.  Playing career  An infielder for most of his career, Kim was also a pitcher for his first few seasons. His most frequent appearance as a pitcher was in 1982, his first year in the league (and incidentally the first year of the KBO), when he went 10‚Äì5 with a 2.79 ERA. As a hitter that year, he batted .305 with 13 home runs and 69 runs batted in, leading the league in RBI. In 1985, Kim won his first MVP award, hitting .333 with a league-leading 22 home runs and 75 RBI, second in the league. That year he also led the KBO in hits with 133 and doubles with 29. In 1988, Kim won his second MVP award, hitting .333 (third in the league), smacking a league-leading 30 home runs and 89 RBI, and leading the Tigers to their fourth KBO championship. His 30 home runs that year was the first time anyone in the KBO League had reached the 30-homer milestone (particularly impressive because the season was only 108 games). In 1989, Kim won his third home run title, with 26, and also led the league in runs with 93 and walks with 84.

Gem Gaming announced the project in 1995, as The Reserve, with an opening planned for July 4, 1996. Construction began later in 1995, and the project was topped off in May 1996, with an opening scheduled for October 1. Steve Rebeil and Dominic Magliarditi, both of Gem Gaming, were the project developers. Later in 1996, Ameristar Casinos planned to purchase Gem Gaming, and construction slowed to allow for an expanded redesign of the project, which was then expected to open between March and April 1997. In January 1997, Rebeil and Magliarditi were denied gaming licenses to operate the casino. Later that year, construction was stopped for three months when Ameristar accused Rebeil and Magliarditi of attempting to prevent Ameristar from issuing 7.5 million public stocks, which was to pay for the acquisition of Gem Gaming. Ameristar Casinos ultimately opened The Reserve on February 10, 1998, with an African safari/jungle theme, although the resort failed to generate a substantial profit. In 2001, The Reserve was purchased by Station Casinos, which renovated and reopened the hotel-casino as the southwestern party-themed Fiesta Henderson. The resort is a sister property to another Station Casinos property, Fiesta Rancho in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The Reserve (1998‚Äì2001) The hotel-casino, originally known as The Reserve, was built in Henderson, Nevada, near Black Mountain, on Lake Mead Drive near U.S. Route 95. Construction The Reserve was announced by Gem Gaming in April 1995, with plans to break ground later that summer for an opening on July 4, 1996. The $60 million project would be the company's first hotel-casino, and would target motorists from Arizona and California. It was estimated that more than 80,000 cars passed by the project site each day, a number that was expected to increase to over 150,000 following the completion of a nearby beltway. Aside from the main resort, Gem Gaming planned for two additional phases of construction, to add other amenities such as a movie theater and more hotel rooms. Construction was underway in November 1995, and the project's architectural plans were approved the following month by the Henderson Planning Commission. Steve Rebeil and Dominic Magliarditi of Gem Gaming were the project developers. In April 1996, Ameristar Casinos agreed to merge with Gem Gaming. Ameristar planned to open the property with 225 hotel rooms, 1,000 slot machines, and 35 gaming tables. After its planned opening, Ameristar intended to expand the casino to and increase the hotel by an additional 500 rooms, with plans to ultimately increase it to 1,500 rooms. The project was topped off on May 17, 1996, and was approximately 45 percent finished, with an opening on track for October 1 of that year. Interior work was expected to begin in June 1996, following the completion of exterior work. By August 1996, construction had slowed to allow for the design of a second phase of the project. The decision to expand the project came as the result of the pending company merger. The redesign was also chosen to help the resort compete against Station Casinos' upcoming Sunset Station hotel-casino, also in Henderson. The first phase would include the casino, while the second phase would include additional casino space and an additional 350 hotel rooms, for a new total of 600. The project was expected to cost a total of $100 million. By October 1996, Ameristar chose to instead purchase Gem Gaming and become the sole owner of the project, while Rebeil and Magliarditi would operate the casino. An opening date between March and April 1997 was expected. Expansion plans received approval from the Henderson Planning Commission in February 1997. In January 1997, Rebeil and Magliarditi were denied gaming licenses because of evidence that Rebeil's home development company was involved in a credit scam; as a result, they were not allowed to work for Ameristar. In March 1997, construction was delayed for more than three months, when Ameristar accused Rebeil and Magliarditi of attempting to prevent Ameristar from issuing 7.5 million public stocks, which was to pay for the acquisition of Gem Gaming Inc. In May 1997, Ameristar settled the dispute for $32.7 million. Construction resumed the following month. Work on the resort ‚Äì including drywall, murals, and expansion plans ‚Äì was nearing completion in November 1997, with an opening targeted for January. At the time, the resort was receiving approximately 600 employee applicants per day. Design The hotel-casino was designed by Henry Conversano, who also designed The Mirage resort on the Las Vegas Strip, and The Lost City at Sun City Resort Hotel and Casino in Sun City, South Africa. The hotel-casino's theme revolved around the concept of a fictional adventurer named Congo Jack, who had crash-landed his airplane in an African-themed environment, and was nursed back to health by Monsoon Mary. During The Reserve's operation, actors had been hired to portray the characters, also created by Conversano. A restaurant and a lounge were also named for them: Congo Jack Cafe and Monsoon Mary Lounge. The Reserve also included statues and murals of exotic animals in a jungle setting. The construction delay in 1997 allowed Conversano time to improve and redesign the resort, by adding a sound system which replicated the sound of rainstorms, birds, and lions throughout the high-ceilinged gaming and dining areas. Conversano also had time to integrate Congo rain forests into the resort's design. The resort's entrance was marked by 80-foot-high elephant tusks, and its parking lot was designed to resemble a Serengeti grassland. Opening and operation The resort opened with a fireworks show on the night of February 10, 1998, with a 10-story, 224-room hotel; a casino, with 26 table games and 1,435 slot machines; three lounges; four restaurants; and a 300-seat bingo hall. Henderson mayor James B. Gibson was among thousands of people who attended the resort's opening. The Reserve was valued at $125 million at the time. Upon opening, The Reserve's targeted clientele was local residents in Henderson, which was the fastest-growing city in the United States at that time. The resort opened with the first phase completed, and Ameristar owned a vacant area of 28 acres surrounding the resort, with the option to purchase an additional 20 acres for future expansions. Ameristar chose to wait until the resort gained a customer base before proceeding with any expansions. By March 1999, The Reserve had lost a substantial amount of money. To improve the resort's earnings, Ameristar initiated a plan that included promotions, direct mail marketing, cash-back programs, improved operating efficiencies, and reductions in labor costs. The following month, Ameristar reported that the resort had generated profit for the first time during February and March 1999. Anthony Curtis of the Las Vegas Advisor opined that while The Reserve had good bargain deals, it suffered from a bad location and a \\"strange theme,\\" saying, \\"The jungle theme was always dark and brooding, and I think that turned people off a bit.\\" The Reserve also faced competition from the Sunset Station. Remodeling and expansion work was underway in May 1999. In October 2000, Ameristar agreed to purchase two Missouri casinos owned by Station Casinos, which would then purchase The Reserve in exchange. Station Casinos also planned to purchase the Fiesta hotel and casino in North Las Vegas, Nevada, and considered redesigning The Reserve and renaming it as another Fiesta location. Ameristar sold The Reserve to for $71.8 million to Station Casinos, which took over ownership on January 30, 2001. The resort was temporarily closed that day to allow for the ownership change to take place. At the time, The Reserve had a casino. Station Casinos also purchased the Fiesta that month. Fiesta Henderson (2001‚Äìpresent) Fiesta Henderson sign in 2018 On April 23, 2001, Station Casinos announced that The Reserve would be renamed as Fiesta Henderson, as the company had hoped to turn Fiesta into a successful brand name. Station Casinos' chief financial officer said that some day, there would \\"almost certainly\\" be more than two Fiesta casinos in the Las Vegas Valley. During 2001, Station Casinos spent $12 million on a five-month renovation of the resort, which included replacing its jungle theme with a southwestern party theme. The resort's jungle-themed decor was donated and auctioned. The Fiesta Henderson celebrated its official grand opening with a fireworks show on December 29, 2001. In April 2005, Station Casinos announced a $70 million expansion of the resort, which would include expansion of the race and sportsbook, and the addition of a 12-screen movie theater, a 1,500-space parking garage, and 350 slot machines. The expansion was expected to begin in July 2005, and be completed by June 2006. The parking garage was opened in August 2006. Other renovations were underway as of October 2006, and were completed in 2007. The 12-screen movie theater, operated by Regal Cinemas, opened in October 2007. It was Regal Cinemas' first all-digital movie theater. From 2009 to 2011, Fiesta Rancho and Fiesta Henderson were voted \\"Best Video Poker\\" by readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The Fiesta casinos were also chosen by the Las Vegas Review-Journal for its 2011 \\"Best Bingo\\" award. A remodeling of the hotel rooms was completed in April 2016, and the resort exterior was also updated, including a new paint color. A renovation of the sportsbook, including new seating and LED television screens, was completed in July 2017. As of 2017, the casino is . On September 13, 2019, approximately 300 employees voted 57 percent in favor to unionize the property. The employees would be represented by the Culinary Workers Union. As of March 2020, the property has been closed until further notice.

The game was produced for the brand in the Fall of 1997 and released in the Spring of 1998. The Lost Island of Alanna represents an early example of integrated, digital, viral and social marketing using the internet. Alanna included a distributed cd-rom game, integrated social, chat rooms, under-the-cap codes, special product packaging, advertising, outdoor, and 2 promotional websites. All created, produced and managed nationally by Raintree Media throughout the full promotional duration. Strategy The strategy was to create an underground campaign designed to increase the appeal of Cherry Coke to teens and young adults who are part of what was then \\"the emerging wired generation.\\" Alanna was a marketing success, shifting to a youth-brand in the minds of young consumers. Implementation The campaign by Raintree Media created consumer engagement through underground social dialog while integrating product placement within the myth of a cd-rom videogame. In the game, you explore an island where an ancient civilization was concerned about passing on its wisdom, but was wiped out by a volcano before it was able to share its precious knowledge. This civilization used clay bowls and a mixture of sparkling water and cherries in tribal ceremony. Cross reference this with bottles of Cherry Coke, on the labels of which you'll find clues in the form of cuneiform characters, and you're on your way to solving the mystery. Clues to solve puzzles in the videogame were also distributed through other marketing channels including the Cherry Coke website and another fictitious website called the Standlake University of Cultural Anthropology which posted journal entries as clues. Viral activities included hidden symbols under bottle caps, the aforementioned cuneiform bottle packaging designed by Raintree Media, and hidden within mainstream Cherry Coke magazine ads. Socially, clues were leaked ‚Äòunderground‚Äô in chat rooms by teams of teens managed by Raintree Media. Apart from the Cherry Coke brand being minimized within the game The Lost Island of Alanna gameplay was unusual within the promotional brand-game genre. Not only was it far more complex, but consumers were provided with very little information about the game, and no obvious goals or objectives were communicated. This meant that players merely began to explore the island and interact with the brand socially through various communication points in real life. All intended to create dialog between the brand and the emerging millennial generation. Gameplay The cd-rom gameplay of The Lost Island of Alanna consisted of a first-person journey through a very small interactive puzzle-solving island. The player moved by clicking on locations shown on the screen; the scene then crossfaded into another frame where the player could continue exploring or solving puzzles. The game had a single ending; the mystery solved. At the end, another game component was revealed in the form of a fortune-cookie engagement; a secondary under-the-cap mechanism providing an extension of the promotion beyond the standard promotional period. Plot A shipwreck was discovered off the coast of Syria that points to an ancient civilization called Alanna. Archeologists at the Standlake University followed the clues and located a volcanic island in the eastern Mediterranean sea just west of Cyprus. Like the historic island of Thera, much of Alanna was destroyed and its ancient culture obliterated by the eruption around the end of the late Bronze Age. (from the Standlake University notes) The Standlake University website also posted journal entries of a ledger recording that 8 tablets made of clay, gemstones, and precious metals, and a letter written by the king of Alanna were all found within the shipwreck. On these tablets are the answers to the culture of the Alannians. The player's quest was to unlock the riddles of the 8 stone tablets, find the hidden chamber, and discover the secrets of Alanna. Enigmatic Plot The Lost Island of Alanna's secret plot was revealed in the endgame. The creative concept was that the Alannian civilization believed that one's future could be read using 'magic' tribal bowls. One such clay bowl, inscribed with cuneiform was found on the shipwreck holding clues needed later. Legend had it that cherries would be smeared into the bottom of this tribal bowl, and natural sparkling water and maple serum would be poured into the bowl. Tribal wise men would stir and drink the contents then read the stains; the darker stains remaining in cuneiform were believed to be the answers to questions. This ancient Cherry Coke reference created the secret endgame mechanic. The endgame mechanic was a different spin on the soda giant's collect-the-bottle-and-win promotions. 32 different bottle labels were pushed into distribution along with 16 under the cap codes. As the cap + bottle pairings were random, so would be the combinations. The fortune-cookie mechanism was simple. Buy a bottle with the question you wanted answered and your bottle cap would 'tell the future' This created a deeper social extension and viral pass along beyond the 'buy for clues' mechanism. Reception Upon release, the game The Lost Island of Alanna was well received with its first 750,000 copies being consumed through request in 2 months. Consumers could call in or request copies from the Cherry Coke website. Unique, double-discs sets, one for you and one for a friend, were tipped into GamePro Magazine, July Issue 1998. The Lost Island of Alanna was successful for Cherry Coke and was widely accepted as a 'great free game' Legacy The Lost Island of Alannas success sparked opportunities for several successive interactive campaigns by Raintree Media for the Coca-Cola Company. The NHL Challenge for Powerade along with Time Tremors for Cherry Coke released the following year with music by award- winning artist Jesper Kyd. Raintree Media also produced Barqsville, a Barq's Root Beer humorous interactive in 1999 and 2000 for the Coca-Cola Company.

It was built from 1854 to 1856. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2003.  History  Friend Park is the site of the former Port Curtis Government Residence and Domain, established in 1854-56. The former residence was constructed for, and occupied by, Captain Maurice Charles O'Connell, who in 1854 was appointed Government Resident, Police Magistrate, and Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Port Curtis and Leichhardt districts of New South Wales (the separation of Queensland did not occur until 1859). The Domain was laid out in mid-1854, and a stone residence was completed by the end of 1856. The township of Gladstone was established by the New South Wales Government in 1853-54. Historian Lorna McDonald suggests that this was possibly an attempt to create a more centralised alternative to Brisbane as the capital of a potential northern colony, because unlike most Queensland ports, Gladstone was established prior to the expansion of pastoral settlement in the hinterland. In April 1853 the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Charles Augustus Fitzroy, announced the intention of establishing a township at Port Curtis, and in May that year surveyor Francis MacCabe was instructed to undertake a survey for the town of Gladstone. In naming the town Gladstone, Fitzroy commemorated British Colonial Secretary William Ewart Gladstone, who in 1846 had attempted to establish a northern colony in the Antipodes. On 17 February 1846 Queen Victoria signed Letters Patent establishing the Colony of North Australia, and the British Parliament passed an Act to define its boundaries, which included all lands and coastal islands north of latitude 26¬∞ south and extending from the east coast to the present-day Western Australia border. The new colony therefore included all of the present-day Northern Territory and most of what later became Queensland, but with the exception of the Moreton Bay, Darling Downs, and Maranoa districts. On 21 February 1846 Queen Victoria appointed Fitzroy as governor and commander in chief of the colony of North Australia, and on 25 May 1846 appointed Lieutenant-Colonel George Barney as Lieutenant-Governor and Superintendent of North Australia, to administer the new colony on Fitzroy's behalf. Gladstone's objective in establishing the colony of North Australia was to provide a place of exile for expirees and reformed convicts from both Australian and British gaols. This in effect meant a resumption of transportation to eastern Australia, and was bitterly opposed in New South Wales. In late 1846 Gladstone was replaced as Colonial Secretary by Earl Grey, who reversed his predecessor's colonial policies. On 28 November 1846 Queen Victoria revoked the colony of North Australia, but word did not reach New South Wales before an attempt was made early in 1847 to establish a settlement at Port Curtis. Colonel Barney and his family had arrived in Sydney in September 1846. Despite finding considerable colonial opposition to the resumption of convict transportation, Barney carried out his instructions and in November 1846 explored the North Australia coast and selected Port Curtis as a settlement site. Barney and the first contingent of 87 officials and settlers left Sydney on the barque Lord Auckland on 30 December 1846 and arrived at Port Curtis on 25 January 1847, during the height of the wet season. Their ship ran aground and the passengers were embarked at Facing Island, where they waited in tents for 7 weeks, surviving principally on dried meat and biscuits, before a relief ship, the barque Thomas Lowry, arrived on 14 March 1847.Download The wet season hindered the establishment of a settlement on the mainland, and there was discontent within the isolated community. The relief ship also brought news that the colony was likely to be abandoned. This was confirmed officially with the arrival of another ship on 14 April 1847. The settlement was disbanded between April and July 1847, during which time Colonel Barney took the opportunity to explore the Gladstone district, which he considered had great potential as the site of future settlement. Port Curtis he considered one of the finest natural harbours in the Australian colonies. Barney Point and Barney Point Beach are named in his honour. The second attempt at non-indigenous settlement at Port Curtis, made six years later in 1853, was more successful. By 23 October 1853 Francis MacCabe had completed his Design for the Town of Gladstone, Port Curtis. Like Colonel Barney in 1847, he identified the area between Auckland Inlet and South Trees Inlet as the most suitable site for a settlement. The principal township was laid out near Auckland Inlet, but MacCabe set aside a substantial area from Barney Point to south of what is now Friend Park, as a reserve for Public Quay, Custom House and Public Offices; and a large reserve for Government House, Domain and Gardens further to the southeast, adjacent to Waapentake Creek. A large sand flat separated the proposed domain from the sea. MacCabe's plan was laid before the New South Wales Executive Council on 6 December 1853 and the Town of Gladstone was proclaimed on 21 December 1853. Sir Maurice Charles O'Connell, 1840 On 1 January 1854 Captain Maurice Charles O'Connell, grandson of former New South Wales Governor Sir William Bligh, was appointed as Government Resident, Police Magistrate and Commissioner for Crown Lands for the Port Curtis and Leichhardt districts. These pastoral districts were proclaimed on 10 January 1854, with Port Curtis declared a settled district although only two stations had been established here by 1854. The first sale of town lots at Gladstone was held in Sydney on 9 February 1854, and by the time O'Connell arrived at Port Curtis at the end of March 1854, the first slab buildings had been erected near Auckland Inlet. O'Connell and his family and other officials set up residence in tents at Barney Point Beach, in the area proposed as public reserve and out of the way of commercial development closer to Auckland Inlet. Here a small residential precinct soon developed. The O'Connells lived aboard ship for a month while a temporary government residence was being erected: a large marquee with a timber floor. It is understood that this marquee was erected on the low promontory at the southern end of Barney Point Beach, in the area now known as Friend Park. On 16 April 1854 Governor Fitzroy arrived at Gladstone to inspect the fledgling settlement, and the following day officially installed O'Connell as Government Resident. Whether this ceremony occurred near the temporary government residence, in what is now Friend Park, is not clear. During the 1954 celebrations of the centenary of the establishment of Gladstone, the Gladstone community re-enacted the arrival of Fitzroy on Barney Point Beach and the installation ceremony, which was conducted in Friend Park before an audience of 6500 people. To commemorate the event, a cairn was unveiled in Friend Park. By early July 1854 O'Connell had decided that the promontory at the southern end of Barney Point Beach, which had been intended as a temporary camp only, would be a more appropriate site for the government residence and domain than the site near Waapentake Creek selected by surveyor MacCabe. O'Connell's domain was laid out with gardens and fencing, but work on construction of a permanent residence in stone did not commence until 1855, and was not completed until late 1856. Amongst O'Connell's regular reports to Sydney was an account of the accidental death on 16 September 1854 of 22 year old Thomas Milles Stratford Riddell, eldest son of the acting NSW colonial secretary. Riddell had been among the first purchasers of Gladstone land at the February 1854 sale in Sydney, and is thought to have accompanied O'Connell to Gladstone in March 1854. He had been assisting in carting water to the township in September when he was thrown under the wheels of the dray and killed instantly. He was buried in the government domain (now Friend Park), and by the early 1900s his grave was marked by a stone sarcophagus. Another early burial in the domain was that of Lieutenant Le Strange. This grave was known in 1954, when a wreath was laid on it during the centenary celebrations, but is no longer evident. At the first census of Gladstone conducted by O'Connell in May 1854, the small community comprised 127 non-indigenous residents. A young visitor to the place in March 1855, Richard Mitchell, claimed the township was known locally as Auckland Point and consisted of two commercial stores and a courthouse near Auckland Inlet, while everyone except the storekeepers lived at Barney Point ‚Äì likely either on or adjacent to the area set aside (but not yet proclaimed) for a public reserve. O'Connell, autocratic by nature and fiery of temperament, was not well liked in the small Gladstone community. Although his correspondence reveals that he had great hopes for the future of Gladstone and Port Curtis, his critics accused him of inaction, and in late 1855 he faced a Select Committee Inquiry into the conduct of the Government Residency at Port Curtis. As a result, the status of Port Curtis was reduced from that of a government residency with its own revenue and government administration, to that of a pastoral district. O'Connell filed his last report as Port Curtis Resident on 26 April 1856, but remained at Gladstone as Lands Commissioner, still occupying the temporary tent house erected for him in April 1854. In late 1856 he moved into the stone dwelling completed in the government domain. O'Connell was reinstated as Government Resident in September 1858 to handle the rapid influx of population into the Port Curtis District following the discovery of gold at Canoona. A rush from August 1858 briefly revived the fortunes of the district, but O'Connell's hopes that Port Curtis and Gladstone would now develop their potential were crushed when it became clear that most prospectors were accessing the Canoona goldfield via Rockhampton. In June 1859 the non-indigenous population of Gladstone was 203, which represented an 8-person increase since 1856, while that of Rockhampton stood at 250. In June 1859 Queen Victoria signed Letters Patent separating the colony of Queensland north of the 29th parallel of latitude, and following the arrival of Governor Bowen and the proclamation of the new colony on 10 December 1859, the Port Curtis Residency became redundant. O'Connell was informed in February 1860, following which he moved to Brisbane where he served as President of the Queensland Legislative Council from 27 August 1860 to 23 March 1879. He still held an interest in the Port Curtis District, being the pastoral lessee of the Riverston run on the Boyne River. Following the abolition of the Port Curtis Residency, O'Connell petitioned the Queensland Government to be allowed to purchase his former house and grounds at Barney Point, claiming that he had invested a considerable amount of his own money on improvements, but the colonial government refused. A survey plan (G14.1) of the government buildings erected at Barney Point, completed by surveyor Clarendon Stuart by 9 July 1860, indicates that the government residency was located on what is now Friend Park. It was a well-ordered establishment comprising a main house, three out houses, stable, cow yard, a formally laid out garden with pathways, and front fencing. To the northwest of the government residence, outside what is now Friend Park, an old brick shed was identified, and further to the northwest, overlooking Barney Point Beach, was the house of the Clerk of Petty Sessions. To the southwest was a more extensive garden and stock yard, which appear to have been associated with the government residence. No graves were identified on the plan. On 11 July 1862 Surveyor Permien completed a survey of sections 55 to 86 of the Town of Gladstone (survey plan G14.7). The area of the government residency and domain was surveyed as section 65 of the Town of Gladstone (later Friend Park), and on this the improvements comprised a stone house, another stone dwelling, stables, garden and fencing. These correspond closely to the improvements indicated on surveyor Stuart's 1860 survey plan. Again, no graves were identified on the plan. Whether anyone occupied the former government residence after O'Connell's departure has not been established. On 28 December 1864 section 65 was purchased from the Crown for , in the name of Alfred Henry Brown of Gladstone. This AH Brown was the six- year-old son of Henry Hort Brown, not to be confused with the Alfred Henry Brown of Gin Gin Station in the Port Curtis Pastoral District. HH Brown was resident in the Port Curtis District by July 1858, when his son Alfred Henry was born, and was among a small party of Gladstone citizens who had prospected for gold at Canoona in mid-1858 and who were largely responsible for the rush of late 1858. It has not been established whether the Brown family ever lived in the former government residence. The family was resident in the Richmond district of New South Wales during most of the 1860s, where children were born in 1860, 1862, 1863, 1865, and 1867. They had returned to Queensland by December 1867 and were still in this colony in November 1870, but may not have been resident in Gladstone. Thereafter no further record of this family in Queensland has been located. Henry Hort Brown died in the Helensburgh district of New South Wales in 1904. Following his death, the site of the former Port Curtis Government Residency was transferred to his widow, Theresa Brown. Ruins of Government Residence, Gladstone, 1906The former government residence at Port Curtis had been long abandoned by late 1888, when a sketch captioned \\"Ruins of Government Residence, Port Curtis\\" appeared in the Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil of 27 December 1888. The sketch shows the partly crumbling walls of a roofless stone residence. Photographs of the ruins taken in 1905 and 1906 show only remnants of the stone walls, and the site overgrown with grasses and saplings. By the 1920s some members of the Gladstone community were keen to see the site conserved. In 1927 the Gladstone Chamber of Commerce urged the Gladstone Town Council to preserve \\"historic spots\\" such as the graves at Barney Point([that is, those located in the former government domain at the southern end of Barney Point Beach). Following the death of Theresa Brown in December 1927, the site was acquired in 1929 from her family (who were resident in Sydney) by Gladstone businessmen and former alderman Henry Friend junior. Friend had purchased the property with the express intention of presenting it to the Gladstone Town Council, which he did in November 1929. As a site of strong historical significance to the Gladstone community, the land was to be held by the Council in perpetuity for the people of Gladstone. To honour the generous gift, the site was named Friend Park. In 1935 George Simmons, curator of the Rockhampton Botanical Gardens, provided sketch plans for Gladstone's three parks: Friend Park, Victoria Park [on Auckland Hill] and Central Park, and Rockhampton City Council gifted trees to Gladstone to assist in the park improvements. During 1954 the highlight of the centenary celebrations was the unveiling by Gladstone's oldest inhabitant, Mrs Fanny Golding, of the cairn in Friend Park commemorating the installation of Captain Maurice O'Connell as Government Resident on 17 April 1854. In the mid-1950s Gladstone's Junior Chamber of Commerce (established in 1954) made the creation of a children's playground in Friend Park its principal project. In December 1958 the Gladstone Jaycees handed over the completed playground to the Council. The place remains one of Gladstone's principal parks, and a popular picnic area. In the late 20th century a decision was made by the Gladstone City Council to remove the stone foundations and remnants of the 1856 government residence. On Sunday 22 June 2003 a memorial cairn to Francis MacCabe was unveiled in Friend Park by the Mayor of Gladstone Peter Corones.  Description  Friend Park is a site located on a low promontory or headland at the southern end of Barney Point Beach and Barney Point Park. The promontory juts into Port Curtis on its northern and eastern sides, with views across Port Curtis, and a rocky foreshore extends around the promontory from Barney Point Beach. On the west the site is bounded by Sutton Street and on the south by Friend Street. The site slopes (gently in some sections, more steeply in others) down to the foreshore, the slope being rocky and covered with agave spp and indigenous small trees and grasses. The foreshore is composed of principally alluvial muds from the Calliope River and various creek systems entering Port Curtis, deposited over Carboniferous sandstones and mudstones of the Wondilla Group. At the northern end of Friend Park a low dry-stone retaining wall separates a gentle sloping bank from the foreshore and Barney Point Park. The slope here is grassed and almost terraced, and a \\"stair\\" of stones set into the ground at intervals enables easy access to the parkland above. Above the slope the park comprises an open lawn with specimen trees, including a lone Norfolk Island Pine (Araucaria heterophylla), Ficus sp., palms, and Eucalyptus sp.], several memorials, a timber dais, and children's play equipment. Close to the apex of the site is the 1954 cairn. This is a four-sided, tapering structure with a flat top, constructed of what appears to be water-polished stone. It rests on a substantial concrete base about high, and has a bitumened plinth and a low concrete-post-and- single- steel-rail surround. On the northern face of the cairn is a marble plaque with the lettering: > On this spot the first official residence in North Australia was erected, > and Captain Maurice Charles O'Connell was installed first Government > Resident, Police Magistrate and Commission of Crown Lands, on 17th April > 1854 by Sir Charles Fitzroy Governor of New South Wales. Unveiled Centenary > Celebrations 17th April 1954. In the mid-north section of the park is a low-set timber dais resting on timber stumps, with timber railing to three sides and a timber ramp to enable easy access. Just west of this is the grave of Thomas Riddell. This has a stone sarcophagus with two inscriptions, and an iron grave surround (not original) with concrete corner posts. The inscriptions on the sarcophagus read: > Underneath this stone are deposited the remains of THOMAS MILLES STRATFORD > RIDDELL eldest son of the Acting Colonial Secretary and Mrs Riddell. and He > was born at Sydney on 22 January 1832 and died at Port Curtis on the 16 > September 1854 aged 22 years. Further west still is a steel flagstaff associated with the creation of the 1958 children's play area in Friend Park. This has a tapered concrete base, with a metal plaque on the western face which bears the following inscription: This play area was planned and equipped by the Gladstone Junior Chamber of Commerce and presented to the citizens of Gladstone on 6 December 1958. While there are no above-ground relics associated with the use of the site as the Port Curtis Government Residence and Domain, there are likely to be sub- surface deposits of archaeological interest.  Heritage listing  Friend Park and Graves was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Friend Park is one of the most significant historical sites in the Gladstone district, being closely associated with the establishment of Gladstone township in 1853-54. It is also a significant place in Queensland's history, being the site of the former Government Residence and Domain of the Port Curtis Residency, associated with the early development of Port Curtis as the potential hub of a possible northern colony separate from New South Wales. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Although little above-ground evidence remains of the former use of the site as the Port Curtis Government Residence and Domain, the place is significant for its potential to reveal archaeological information which may assist in our understanding of Queensland's history. This includes evidence of structures and graves on the site, as well as artefacts associated with daily life in the government domain of a remote, mid-19th century British colonial settlement. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place is significant for the retention of historical views to and from the headland. In particular the view from the headland across Port Curtis varies little from that which Government Resident Captain Maurice O'Connell found in 1854, when he decided to establish the Government Residence and Domain on this promontory. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site has long been valued by the local community for its association with the early history of Gladstone. This is demonstrated in the purchase of the site and donation to the Gladstone Town Council in 1929 by Henry Friend jnr; the erection of a cairn in the park in 1954 to celebrate the centenary of the founding of Gladstone; and Gladstone City Council's nomination of the early graves to the Queensland Heritage Register in the 1990s.

The title is part of the \\"Picross\\" nonogram series that use number-based grid puzzles to reveal pictures. It was released as a downloadable title on the Nintendo 3DS eShop worldwide in December 2015. Gameplay Pok√©mon Picross follows the typical format of nonogram puzzles, in which players must use numbers depicted on a grid to determine which sections to fill and not fill in. In this a game a twist is added in which, when a puzzle is completed, players are rewarded with a Pok√©mon based on the puzzle they cleared. These Pok√©mon can be set before starting a puzzle and can utilise various abilities based on their type. For example, Electric-type Pok√©mon can slow down the levels' timer, while Fire-types can automatically fill in certain areas of the grid in a cross-shape pattern. Each Pok√©mon has a cooldown period after their ability is used, and their ability may be limited to grids under a certain size, anywhere form 10x10 to 20x15 (the smallest and largest Pok√©mon puzzle sizes respectively). The game's free-to-play elements revolve around items known as Picrites, which are required to perform various actions such as unlocking new areas, increasing the number of Pok√©mon that can be set, opening up Mega Evolution and Alt World stages, and instantly restoring the Energy gauge (the latter of which is replenished over time). In addition to purchasing them with real money, players can obtain Picrites by clearing certain objectives in each stage (such as using a particular Pok√©mon or beating the stage within a certain time limit), playing the Daily Challenge (which tasks players with clearing several smaller puzzles in quick succession), and unlocking certain achievements as they play. Clearing certain stage objectives also unlocks Mural Tiles, which contain individual Picross puzzles as part of a larger mural puzzle. The game also features a spending cap in which, if the player spends a certain amount of money on Picrites, they will be able to receive additional Picrites for free. Development Pok√©mon Picross was first announced on a November 12, 2015 Nintendo Direct broadcast, along with a worldwide release date set for the following month. The title's developer, Jupiter Corporation, had originally planned to release a game called Pok√©mon Picross on the Game Boy Color, 16 years earlier, previews of which appeared in Japanese gaming magazines in Spring 1999. However, this game was ultimately cancelled. In September 2020, alongside other data and unreleased games, a playable version was discovered in the Nintendo \\"Gigaleak 3\\".https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7kp3b9/nintendos-secrets-are-continuing- to-leak-revealing-its-unknown-history Reception Pok√©mon Picross received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Kyle Hilliard of Game Informer found that the game was \\"difficult to recommend universally\\", and that the free-to-play mechanic was not conducive to a Picross-style puzzle title, stating \\"Free-to-play is not inherently a bad thing... but unlike most successful free-to-play games, Picross puzzles are not randomized nor worth replaying.\\" The editor did commend the title for not being an \\"endless money-sink\\" by having the in-game currency become free after 5,000 are purchased. Destructoid found the game to be an improvement over previous Picross entries, stating \\"Aside from the strangely disguised pricing scheme, the new additions to Pok√©mon Picross exceed expectations,\\" giving special mention to its mission mechanic, the unlocking of \\"mural\\" images, and \\"mega rows\\" that encourage non-standard play.

It was built in 1935 as a dormitory hall for female descendants of Confederate States Army veterans. Its former name resulted in multiple lawsuits and student unrest. In August 2016, Vanderbilt announced it would reimburse the United Daughters of the Confederacy for their financial contribution and remove the word Confederate from the building. History The project was initiated by the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) as early as the mid-1890s and was supported by Peabody College president James D. Porter, a Confederate veteran and former Tennessee governor, in 1902. Edith D. Pope, the second editor of the Confederate Veteran and a leading member of the Nashville No. 1 chapter of the UDC, played a key role in its construction. In addition, Pope and other members of the UDC made sure the college would offer a course on Southern history. The construction of Confederate Memorial Hall was supported by a $50,000 donation from the UDC in 1933. The total cost of construction was $140,000. The building was completed in 1935. It was used as a residential building by female descendants of Confederate veterans who were selected by the UDC to live free of charge while they studied education. Memorial Hall in 2006 The building became part of Vanderbilt University campus in 1979 when the university acquired Peabody College. By 1988, students were holding protests on campus, arguing the building's name was offensive to black students. As a result, the university added a memorial plaque near the building to contextualize the origin of the name. When Gordon Gee became Chancellor in 2002, he tried to change the name of the building. However, the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued the university in the Davidson County Chancery Court. The case went to the Tennessee Supreme Court, and Judge William C. Koch, Jr. sided with the UDC. By 2005, Judge William B. Cain of the Tennessee Court of Appeals concluded that the word Confederate was not about slavery, but about the fallen soldiers of the Confederate States Army, who defended their land against Northern invaders. When he suggested Vanderbilt University would have to repay the UDC for their $50,000 donation (adjusted to inflation), the university dropped the lawsuit. However, the university used the name \\"Memorial Hall\\" in their publications. In November 2015, students asked Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos to change the name on the building, arguing that \\"Vanderbilt refuses to pay $1 million to the Daughters of the Confederacy to divorce this university from its 'racist' past but raised $10 million to renovate campus baseball facilities\\". On August 15, 2016, the university announced it would remove the word Confederate from the building after receiving an anonymous donation of $1.2 million to repay the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The UDC \\"reluctantly\\" accepted the donation. Meanwhile, the university hid the word Confederate with a \\"temporary covering\\". Alumnus Clay Travis, a Fox Sports journalist, criticized his alma mater's decision to remove the word Confederate, comparing them to \\"Middle Eastern terrorists\\". In response, Jack Daniel's canceled a $3,000 promotion deal it had with Travis.

Voltaire reworked the structure of the play in order to fit the classical model of French drama. L'Orphelin de la Chine adheres to the theory of three unities, which codified that dramas should conform to the unity of action, unity of time, and unity of place. Voltaire's 1753 version of the drama follows the three-act structure and was later expanded to five acts when it was performed by Comedie Francaise in 1755. Background Voltaire's source of inspiration was a translation of The Orphan of Zhao by Joseph Henri Marie de Pr√©mare, a French Jesuit missionary who lived in China. Pr√©mare translated a portion of the original play for √âtienne Fourmont, a French orientalist. Jean-Baptiste Du Halde included Pr√©mare's translation as part of his Description de la Chine, a compilation of European reports on China, under the name Le petit orphelin de la maison Tchao, trag√©die chinoise. Europe's sinomania and chinoiserie fad was at its height and works about China were in high demand. The success of Halde's book brought the play to the attention of French playwrights such as Voltaire. Voltaire's adaptation was also written as a response to the Manchu conquest of the Ming dynasty and the creation of the Manchu Qing dynasty. His version of the story changed the play's setting from the state of Jin during the Spring and Autumn period to a locale near the Great Wall coinciding with Mongol conquest of the Southern Song dynasty. He deliberately chose the Mongols as an analogue to the contemporaneous Manchus who ruled 18th-century China. Voltaire himself acted in an amateur production of the play in June 1763, playing the role of Genghis Khan. SynopsisReception The play premiered on 20 August 1755, with a run of seventeen performances. It was a popular success, but provoked hostile critical responses including from Charles Coll√©, La Morli√®re, Antoine Poinsinet, and Jean-Fran√ßois de La Harpe It is celebrated in a painting by Anicet Charles Gabriel Lemonnier, \\"Reading of the tragedy of L'Orphelin de la Chine in the room of Madame Geoffrin\\", which shows a roomful of Parisian intellectuals listening to the reading.Les ≈íuvres compl√®tes de Voltaire volume 45A, published 2009 by the Voltaire Foundation, University of Oxford. pp. 79-83.

There was a by- election in October 2016 to fill a vacancy in the district of Vale. Electoral system Following the 2012 general election, it was decided to reduce the number of seats from 45 to 38. This resulted in reductions to the number of seats in most electoral districts, although the districts themselves remained unchanged. A new electoral roll was drawn up, with 22,408 people registered to vote by 4 November 2015. The total passed 25,000 by 7 January 2016 and rose to 27,000 on 15 February, before reaching 30,320 when registration closed, higher than the 29,745 who registered for the 2012 elections. Campaign Prospective candidates started to register by filing their nominations at the Bailiff's Chambers on 21 March and had until 31 March 2016 to file nomination forms. There are no political parties; all candidates stood as non-partisans. Candidates could apply for a grant of up to ¬£600 for the production and distribution of manifestos.

Strandgade 95 in Helsing√∏r, Denmark Stephen Hansen (28 September 1701 ‚Äì 22 January 1770) was a Danish industrialist, businessman and General War Commissioner. He is most known for his involvement with Kronborg Rifle Factory in Helleb√¶k and for building Helleb√¶kg√•rd as well as the Stephen Hansen Mansion on the harbourfront in Helsing√∏r.. Early life and military career Hansen was born on 28 August 1701 in the village of Skodsb√∏l in the Parish of Oddum in western Jutland. Little is known about his early years. In 1728, he was appointed to quartermaster at the Artillery Regiment and shortly thereafter also to recruitment officer (Danish: M√∏nsterskriver) and Judge Advocate General (Danish: Audit√∏r) at the Naval Artillery. In 1747, he was appointed to Superior War Commissioner but resigned from the military in 1750 to focus on his civil career as an industrialist and merchant. Civil career Stephen Hansen's Helleb√¶kg√•rd from 1747 as it appeared prior to the rebuilding in 1768 In 1743, Hansen purchased Helleb√¶kg√•rd and the Hammerm√∏llen industrial enterprise which was in a state of neglect. He expanded the factory and improved operations. He obtained a 20-year monopoly on the manufacture of rifles in Denmark and benefited tremendously from the Seven Year War (1756‚Äì1763)when he supplied rifles for the Danish army in Holstein. In 1761, he was appointed to General War Commissioner. Hansen was also involved in trade on the Garoe Islands on which he had a monopoly from 1750 until 1770. In 1759, he commissioned Philip de Lange to build a Rococo-style mansion in Strandgade in Helsing√∏r. Last years In 1765, Hansen sold Kronborg Rifle Factory to the Danish state for 70,000 Rigsdaler and that same year acquired Frydendal Manor at Holb√¶k. He died on 22 January 1770 and is buried at Frederick's German Church in Copenhagen.

He met and supported Ludwig van Beethoven in the composer's later years. Life He was born in Ruhla, Thuringia in 1769, a son of a maker of keyboard instruments. In 1789 he moved to Hamburg, and in the following year moved to London, settling there as a manufacturer of harps and pianos. He had a workshop on Great Portland Street, and styled himself \\"J. A.

In 1814 he returned to Germany, visiting Weimar where he briefly met Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; it was probably during this visit to Germany that he bought the manuscripts of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's ten last string quartets, from the music publisher Johann Anton Andr√©. They remained in his possession during his lifetime.Preface Alfred Einstein, W. A. Mozart, The Ten Celebrated String Quartets, Courier Corporation, 2013, accessed 20 November 2015.Johann Andreas Stumpff Pamela J. Willetts, The Musical Times Vol. 118, No. 1607 (January 1977), p29, accessed 20 November 2015. Stumpff furthered his acquaintance with Goethe, meeting him in 1824 when he gave him presents of editions of Goethe's works, and again in 1829, when he spent every evening for a week in his company. Stumpff read aloud to Goethe his poem about a steam engine, Der Kampf der Elemente (The Battle of the Elements); Goethe published this and other poems by Stumpff in the Weimar literary periodical Chaos. Stumpff visited Vienna in 1824, and Andreas Streicher gave him a letter of recommendation to Ludwig van Beethoven. Stumpff had a cordial meeting with him, during which it was clear that England was occupying the composer's thoughts. \\"Beethoven had an exaggerated opinion of London, and its highly cultured inhabitants\\", he wrote. Beethoven said to him, \\"England stands high in culture. In London everybody knows something and knows it well, but the man of Vienna can only talk of eating and drinking, and sings and pounds away at music of little significance or of his own making.\\"Nettl, Paul. \\"Stumpff, Joseph Andreas\\". Beethoven Encyclopedia. Philosophical Library, New York. 1956. In 1826 Stumpff sent Beethoven Samuel Arnold's 40-volume edition of Handel's complete works. Beethoven thanked him in a letter of 8 February 1827, in which he also wrote that he was ill and unable to write a note of music, and was in financial difficulty. Stumpff obtained from the Royal Philharmonic Society an advance of money for Beethoven, informing the composer of this in a letter of 1 March; however the help was too late, as Beethoven died on 26 March of that year.

Towering at 6 feet 6 inches, Wertheim was known for his strong wrists and vigorous play. Biography Wertheim was born on 22 December 1893, in Melbourne Victoria, the second son of Hugo Wertheim and Sophie Emilie. His parents were both emigrants from Germany, who settled in Melbourne in the 1880s. He had four siblings, two brothers and two sisters. One of his sisters is the grandmother of former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett. The business which his father founded, Wertheim Pianos, was highly successful and made the family a well known name in Australia. It is said that Nellie Melba would request to use Wertheim pianos for her performances. From 1901 to 1910, Wertheim attended Melbourne Church of England Grammar School before following his older brother into Trinity College, one of the residential colleges of the University of Melbourne, in March 1911. Following his studies, he worked for a period of time in the family business. An interstate tennis player for Victoria, Wertheim first competed in the Australasian Championships in 1911, as a 17-year-old. At the 1914 Australasian Championships he reached the semi- finals in the singles competition, which remained his best performance. His loss in the semi-finals was to eventual champion Arthur O'Hara Wood, a fellow alumnus from his residential college, in four sets. Due to his German heritage, Wertheim was nicknamed \\"Sos\\" or \\"Soss\\", for sausage. He later served in Germany as a member of the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. After enlisting in 1915, Wertheim went to Gallipoli with the 23rd Battalion but only saw the final month of the campaign. He transferred after that to the 2nd Pioneer Battalion in March 1916 and fought in Pozi√®res from July to August and then in Flers. In 1917 he was seconded to the Intelligence Corps and is credited with obtaining vital information from a German prisoner to avert a planned counter-attack. He was mentioned in despatches three times during the war, included those of Douglas Haig, for his interrogation of the German prisoner. In 1919 he returned to Australia. He continued his tennis career in the 1920s and was a regular competitor at the Australasian Championships. Although he wasn't able to reach the final four again he was a doubles semi- finalist on four occasions, with Timothy Fitchett in 1924, Garton Hone in 1925 and Richard Schlesinger in both 1926 and 1929. The 1922 season saw Wertheim called up to the Australian team for the International Lawn Tennis Challenge (Davis Cup) and he played in a quarter-final tie against Czechoslovakia in London. He featured in the doubles, with Gerald Patterson, which they won in straight sets, over Karel Ardelt and Friedrich Rohrer. It was the only rubber he would ever play and he later would jocularly declare that he was one of the few players to be unbeaten in the Davis Cup. While in England he competed at Wimbledon and was runner-up in the All England Plate, after a second round exit in the main draw. He then travelled with the Davis Cup team to America and although he wasn't required for the Davis Cup ties did appear at the U.S. National Championships. One of his finest wins came when he defeated Patterson, then a two-time Wimbledon winner, at the 1925 Victorian Championships. A stock broker, he co-founded a brokerage business called Williams & Wertheim in Collins Street. Illness ended his tennis career in 1929 and for two years he remained bedridden as a result. He recovered well enough to return to work but on 12 October 1933 died at a hospital in East Melbourne after collapsing in the city. His funeral was held at Brighton Cemetery. He was married with three sons.

The two central openings are deeply recessed. The facade of Lisbon Cathedral has two bell towers in the Norman manner and a wheel window. The Romanesque style of architecture was introduced in Portugal between the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th century. In general, Portuguese cathedrals have a heavy, fortress-like appearance, with crenellations and few decorative elements apart from portals and windows. Portuguese Romanesque cathedrals were later extensively modified, among others the Old Cathedral of Coimbra, although it only had some minor changes. Chronological and geographical distribution of Romanesque buildings in Portugal are intimately connected with the territorial organization emerging from the Reconquista, being the fundamental reason for the differences between a locally influenced artistical phenomenon in the North of the country and a more \\"international\\" kind in buildings like Coimbra and Lisbon cathedrals. Romanesque architecture first developed in Minho and Douro regions (with Braga Cathedral being its reference) spreading later southwards to Coimbra. It is in the rural areas of the northwest and center regions that Romanesque buildings are more concentrated, being more dense in the margins of rivers Douro and Mondego. Convent of Christ was built in the second half of the 12th century. Like some other templar churches throughout Europe, was modelled after the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. Introduction S√£o Pedro de Roriz Church like other Romanesque churches, have a strong and heavy appearance. It was in areas that had been recently added to Portuguese territory, thus more open to foreign influence, places where royal and ecclesiastical sponsorship were stronger, where French monastical communities settled in and foreign artists produced their works (like Coimbra and Lisbon), that we find the most artistically complete forms of Romanesque. As it expanded it became more local, mixing with earlier regional construction techniques and solutions. Romanesque building construction activity gained pace after 1095, when Count Henry took possession of the County of Portugal. Count Henry came with noblemen and Benedictine monks from the Abbey of Cluny, which was headed by Henry's brother, Hugh. The Benedictines and other religious orders ended up giving great impulse to Romanesque architecture in Portugal during the whole 12th century. Examples of those rural monastical and parish churches, most of them built in the 9th and 10th centuries with late High Middle Ages artistical features and before the expansion of Romanesque architecture, are the Monastery of Rates, one of the best iconographical buildings of this style in Portugal, the churches of Pa√ßo de Sousa Monastery, Santa Maria de Air√£es and the Monastery of S√£o Pedro de Ferreira, among others. Their communities first followed the Benedictine rule but were later deeply influenced by the monastical reforms in the 11th century, mainly the Cluniac, reflected in the adoption of newly Romanesque architectural features, creating some very regional and rich decorative and architectural solutions. Pre-Romanesque architecture: The Mozarabic art Apse of Castro de Avel√£s Monastery, a mix of Mozarabic and Asturian-Leonese style. Mozarabic art refers not only to the artistic style of Mozarabs (from musta'rab meaning \\"Arabized\\"), Iberian Christians living in Al-Andalus who adopted some Arab customs without converting to Islam, preserving their religion and some ecclesiastical and judicial autonomy, but also to those same communities that migrated north to the Christian Kingdoms, bringing with them an architectural phenomenon in which Christian and Islamic artistic elements were fused together. Although Mozarabic communities maintained for the practice of their religious rites some of the Visigothic churches predating the Islamic occupation, the extent of this Visigothic artistical heritage is hard to pinpoint, as most monuments from the previous period have been lost. Nevertheless, those buildings that did survive seem to hold on tenaciously to traditions of Visigothic architecture with few, if any, Islamic features. All this includes them in the ample concept of Pre-Romanesque architecture. Besides this possible Visigothic connection, Mozarabic architecture in Portugal also came in contact with Asturian art, identified with the artistic creations that were being produced during the 9th century specifically in the territories that comprised the Kingdom of Asturias. However this artistic activity, in general (and architecture specifically) was not limited to this area or this century, it encompassed the whole northern peninsula and continued during the next century. Central nave of the Church of S√£o Pedro de Lourosa (Coimbra) The most exceptional example of Mozarabic architecture in Portugal is the Church of S√£o Pedro de Lourosa, near Coimbra. There is no doubt that this rural church was founded sometime around 912 AD (950 by the Era of Caesar, corresponds to 912 by Christian Era) according to an authentic inscription found in one of the transept arms. Despite a number of Asturian references to the church's engravings, the influences of the architectural models favoured by the Mozarabs are clearly visible in the modulation of the masonry and mainly in the decorative elements of the cornices (use of the Alfiz) and the design of horseshoe arches, typical of Mozarabic style. Its basilican type structure comprises a small transept separating the chancel from the main body of the building (called a Narthex), and a row of three surmounted arches supported by columns separating the central nave from the side aisles. During restoration works carried out in the mid-20th century, various architectural features were found that would have belonged to an earlier Visigothic church. Other examples of Mozarabic monuments in Portuguese territory are the Chapel of S√£o Pedro de Balsem√£o in Lamego, the Cathedral of Idanha-a-Velha, with a more Visigothic influence but still used by the Mozarabic community of the region, the Church of S√£o Gi√£o, near Nazar√©, and the unique apse of the old monastery of Castro de Avel√£s (Bragan√ßa), that presents not only a Mozarabic flavour but also a deep fusion with Asturian-Leonese architectural features. Most scholars had identified its construction from the late 12th and early 13th centuries, although new archeological findings have challenged that date and put its origin back in the 11th century.

Rise and development of Romanesque in Portugal (11th to 13th century) Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra), its original Romanesque facade was later redecorated with Manueline style during the 16th century In Portugal, the Romanesque architecture comes in late 11th century within a wider phenomenon of European cultural and religious spreading to the Iberian Peninsula, influenced by the Cluniac monastical reforms and the arrival of the Orders of Cluny (after 1086), Cister (or Citeaux) (1144), St. Augustine (after 1131) and the Military-Religious Orders of the Knights Hospitaller (1121) and the Knights Templar (1126). The Romanesque architecture, through its prestige, relates with the rise and assertion of Portuguese independence. Developing itself later than witnessed in the rest of Europe, in Portugal it only gained real significance after the second quarter of the 12th century, although previous buildings of the same style already existed. Various factors contribute to this aspect, mainly the unstable environment experienced in the Iberian Peninsula at the time due to the Reconquista and the consequent political reorganisation of peninsular geography. In fact, one of the most significant aspects of Romanesque architecture in the Peninsula, but particularly in Portugal, is the noticeable connotation that we find between its spreading and land organisation and occupation. The arrival in Portugal of the religious orders mentioned above must be understood in the general context of the Reconquista. In fact, those monastical institutions received immense privileges from the Portuguese monarchs and nobility, contributing to the security of the territory, but above all, to its social organization. This Reconquista took place from North to South, resulting in the same spread of Romanesque architecture with a decreasing density to the South. Almost no Romanesque artifacts survive in Southern Portugal.Jos√© Cust√≥dio Vieira da Silva, Portugal ¬ß2: Architecture; Oxford Art online Main fa√ßade of Monastery of Rates old church, a Cluniac monastic building. The first Romanesque churches in the North were simple constructions, consisting of a nave with a timber roof and a rectangular apse. Examples can be found at the Igreja de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o de Rio Mau, at the Igreja de Santa Eul√°lia do Mosteiro de Arnoso and at the Church of Fontarcada (with already a semicircular apse at the east end). Expansion of the Romanesque style coincided with the reign of D.Afonso Henriques (1139‚Äì1185), a monarch with Burgundian background being the son of Count Henry and great grandson of Robert II, King of France. During his reign Lisbon, Coimbra, Porto and Viseu Cathedrals were built and also the Augustinian Monastery of Santa Cruz, projected to be a royal pantheon. The construction began in 1131 and by 1150 the nave and its apses were already finished. Its structural shape and decorative features were a novelty in Portugal, showing that its architect was either probably French or came in contact with French Romanesque architecture from Burgundy like Tournus, Cluny, Paray-le-Monial or Romainm√¥tier. Being a predominantly religious architecture, Portuguese Romanesque style was deeply related with ecclesiastical rural church parishes and monastic monasteries founded or rebuilt in the 12th and 13th centuries, with bishops, by royal mandate, their biggest sponsors. Romanesque cathedrals (Braga, Porto, Viseu, Coimbra and Lisbon)=Braga Cathedral The Cathedral of Braga was rebuilt in the 1070s by Bishop Pedro and consecrated in 1089, although only the apse was finished at the time. He wished to create a pilgrimage church, with a three aisled nave, an ambulatory and a large transept. Works increased during the tenure of D.Paio Mendes as archbishop (1118‚Äì37), after King D.Afonso Henriques granted a foral chart to the city as well as generous donations for its construction. It was then resumed and lasted until the middle of the 13th century. The original 12th- century building was built in the Burgundian Romanesque style of the monastery church of Cluny and influenced many other churches and monasteries in Portugal in that period. In later times the cathedral was greatly modified, so that today it is a mix of Romanesque, Gothic, Manueline and Baroque styles. Main fa√ßade of Braga Cathedral. The entrance gallery (galilee) with three arches is gothic (end of the 15th century), but the towers and upper storeys are early baroque (17th century). The original Romanesque Western fa√ßade of the cathedral has been totally suppressed, except for some archivolts and capitals of the main portal, heavily decorated with animal and human sculptured reliefs. The figures on one archivolt, with hens, foxes and a minstrel, may be telling a moralistic song like the ones from Roman de Renart, of French tradition. Inside it has three aisles covered by a wooden roof, a transept and five Eastern chapels in the apse. On the north wall outside of the cathedral there is the small Chapel of S√£o Geraldo, in memory of Geraldo of Moissac, Archbishop of Braga (1096‚Äì1108), of early Romanesque design, that may be a remnant of the late 11th-century building. This chapel was left outside of the final cathedral, perhaps due to a change of design in the 12th century. The nave is essentially Romanesque thanks to a \\"purifying\\" reform in the 20th century that suppressed most later additions, although some original capitals of the columns have been lost. D.Afonso, son of King D.Jo√£o I, is buried in a 15th-century tomb made of bronze, which can be seen in the nave of the cathedral. Several chapels were built adjacent to the cathedral in the Middle Ages. The Chapel of Kings (Capela dos Reis) was built around 1374 in the place where Count Henrique and Countess Teresa were buried. Their tombs were replaced in the early 16th century by new ones, with recumbent figures. File:Catedral_de_Braga_-_Interior.JPGThree-aisled nave with a wooden roof.

Porto Cathedral Porto Cathedral, its heavy and imposing facade with thick buttresses was later embellished by a Baroque portal. The Porto Cathedral, located in the historical centre of the city of Porto, is one of the city's oldest monuments and one of the most important Romanesque monuments in the country. There is evidence that the city has been a bishopric seat since the Suevi domination in the 5th-6th centuries. The current building was built according to tradition around 1110 under the patronage of Bishop Hugo (1112‚Äì1136), but apparently the church is likely to have been built in the mid-12th century, after 1147, because the \\"De Expugnatione Lyxbonensi\\" appears to describe a small church that appears to match the old pre-Romanesque cathedral built in the 9th-10th centuries. As such, the building was likely built later, as the artistic evidence, that links the Romanesque of this church to the area of La Rochelle, supports. The church was only completed in 1557, when the Manueline lantern tower was installed. The cathedral is flanked by two square towers, each supported with two buttresses and crowned with a cupola. The fa√ßade lacks decoration and is rather architecturally heterogeneous. It shows a Baroque porch and a beautiful Gothic wheel window under a crenellated arch, giving the impression of a fortified church. The Romanesque nave is rather narrow and is covered by barrel vaulting. It is flanked by two aisles with a lower vault. The stone roof of the central aisle is supported by flying buttresses, making the building one of the first in Portugal to use this architectonic feature. This original building has suffered some alterations (minored by the archaizing restorations of the Estado Novo between 1927 and 1945) but the general aspect of the building has remained a mix of Romanesque and Gothic. Also to be referenced the elegant Gothic cloister, built between the 14th and the 15th centuries during the reign of King D.Jo√£o I, who married English Princess Philippa of Lancaster in this cathedral in 1387.

Viseu Cathedral started being built in the 12th century and is the most important historical monument of the city. It is currently a mix of architectural styles, specially from the Manueline, Renaissance and Mannerist periods. The current cathedral building started being erected in the mid-12th century, but little remains from this early Romanesque building except for some architectural details. The church was greatly enlarged in the following centuries of the Middle Ages, assuming its present configuration as a three-aisled building with three Eastern chapels. Some Gothic chapels in the cloisters also date from this period. Built has a three-aisled nave, transept and three Eastern chapels. The main fa√ßade is flanked by two towers. The outer, lateral walls of the church have a heavy, menacing appearance, typical of Portuguese medieval cathedrals, being partially decorated with merlons. The South (clock) tower is still of medieval origin, while the North tower had to be rebuilt in the 17th century after a storm. The storm also destroyed the Manueline fa√ßade, which was rebuilt around 1635. The three-storey fa√ßade resembles a Mannerist altarpiece and is decorated with niches harbouring statues of the Four Evangelists, as well as the Holy Mary and Saint Theotonius.

Coimbra Cathedral The Old Cathedral of Coimbra (Portuguese: S√© Velha de Coimbra) was built some time after the Battle of Ourique in 1139. The project of this Romanesque cathedral is attributed to Master Robert, a, possibly, French architect who was directing the building of Lisbon Cathedral at that time and visited Coimbra regularly. The works were supervised by Master Bernard, possibly also French, who was succeeded by Master Soeiro, an architect active in other churches around the Diocese of Porto. Coimbra Cathedral, with crenellated tops and heavy buttresses giving it a castle like appearance. From the outside, Coimbra's old cathedral looks like a fortress, with its high, crenellated walls harbouring few, narrow windows. This menacing appearance is explained by the belligerent times in which it was built. There is a tower-like structure in the middle of the western fa√ßade with a portal and a similar-looking upper window. Both portal and window are heavily decorated with Romanesque motifs of Mozarabic and Pre-Romanesque influences. The fa√ßade is reinforced by thick buttresses at the corners that compensate for the angle of the terrain (the cathedral was built on the slope of a hill). The interior of the cathedral has a nave with two aisles, a small transept, and an eastern apse with three chapels. The nave is covered by barrel vaulting and the lateral aisles by groin vaults. The nave has an upper storey, a spacious triforium (arched gallery), that could accommodate more mass attendants in the tribunes if needed. All columns of the interior have decorated capitals, mainly with vegetable motifs, but also with animals and geometric patterns. The windows of the lantern-tower and the big window in the west facade are the main sources of natural light of the cathedral. The cloister, built during the reign of Afonso II (early 13th century), is a work of the transition between Romanesque and Gothic. Each of the Gothic pointed arches that face the courtyard encompass two twin round arches in Romanesque style. File:SeVelha-Nave1.jpgBarrel vaulted nave with a high placed arched gallery.

Lisbon Cathedral The Patriarchal Cathedral of St. Mary Major (Portuguese: Santa Maria Maior de Lisboa or S√© de Lisboa) or simply Lisbon Cathedral is the oldest church in the city and the see of Archdiocese of Lisbon. Lisbon Cathedral, severely damaged after the earthquake of 1755, it was rebuilt following the same original 12th-century plan. This first building was completed between 1147 and the first decades of the 13th century in Late Romanesque style. At that time the relics of St. Vincent of Saragossa, patron saint of Lisbon, were brought to the cathedral from Southern Portugal. This cathedral follows a Latin cross plan with three aisles, a transept and a main chapel surrounded by a Gothic ambulatory. The church is connected with a cloister on the Eastern side. The main fa√ßade of the cathedral looks like a fortress, with two towers flanking the entrance and crenellations over the walls. This menacing appearance, also seen in other Portuguese cathedrals of the time, is a relic from the Reconquista period, when the cathedral could be used as a base to attack the enemy during a siege. From its first building period from 1147 until the first decades of the 13th century, Lisbon cathedral has preserved the West fa√ßade with a rose window (rebuilt from fragments in the 20th century), the main portal, the North lateral portal and the nave of the cathedral. The portals have interesting sculptured capitals with Romanesque motifs. The nave is covered by barrel vaulting and has an upper, arched gallery (triforium). Light gets in through the rose windows of the West fa√ßade and transept, the narrow windows of the lateral aisles of the nave as well as the windows of the lantern tower of the transept. The general plan of the cathedral is very similar to that of the Cathedral of Coimbra, which dates from the same period. One of the chapels of the ambulatory has an interesting Romanesque iron gate.

Knights Templar round church (Charola/Rotunda) at Convent of Christ Originally a 12th-century Templar stronghold, when the order was dissolved in the 14th century the Portuguese branch was turned into the Knights of the Order of Christ, that later supported Portugal's maritime discoveries of the 15th century. The Convent and Castle complex in Tomar is a historic and cultural monument which was listed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage list in 1983. The round church of the Knights Templar in Tomar was built to be a fortified chapel, serving both for praying and defense. The convent was founded by the Order of Poor Knights of the Temple (or Templar Knights) in 1160. Its construction continued until the final part of the 12th century with the construction of the Charola (oratory), in one of the angles of the castle, completed by the Grand Master Gualdim Pais sometime around 1180. Templar Church The Romanesque round church (charola, rotunda) was built in the second half of the 12th century by the Knights Templar, as a 16-side polygonal structure, with strong buttresses, round windows and a bell-tower. Inside, the round church has a central, octagonal structure, connected by arches to a surrounding gallery (ambulatory). The general shape of the church is modelled after similar round structures in Jerusalem: the Mosque of Omar and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The capitals of the columns are still Romanesque (end of the 12th century) and depict vegetal and animal motifs, as well as a Daniel in the Lions' Den scene. The style of the capitals shows the influence of artists working on the Cathedral of Coimbra, which was being built at the same time as the round church. The interior of the round church is magnificently decorated with late Gothic/Manueline sculptures and paintings, added during a renovation sponsored by King Manuel I starting in 1499. The pillars of the central octagon and the walls of the ambulatory have polychrome statues of saints and angels under exuberant Gothic canopies, while the walls and ceilings of the ambulatory are painted with Gothic patterns and panels depicting the life of Christ. The paintings are attributed to the workshop of the court painter of Manuel I, the Portuguese Jorge Afonso, while the sculptured decoration is attributed to Flemish sculptor Olivier of Gand and the Spaniard Hern√°n Mu√±oz. A magnificent panel depicting the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, by Portuguese painter Greg√≥rio Lopes, was painted for the Round Church and now hangs in the National Museum of Ancient Art in Lisbon.

In the Middle Ages the structure had no decorations, paintings and golden leafs were added in the 16th century during Manueline style. Churches and monasteries Monastery of Pa√ßo de Sousa, built in the 10th century by the Benedictine monks. As previously stated, Romanesque architecture style reached Portugal by the end of the 11th century by the hand of Cluniac, Cistercian and Augustinian orders, bringing with them the monastical reforms that were already underway in their countries of origin. Their influence and importance on the spreading of this new art form can be asserted by the large number of churches and monasteries, one of the kind of Romanesque buildings that survived until our days. The introduction of this new style coincides with the advance of the Reconquista to the south and the development of recent Portuguese independence and its territorial changes, reflecting this war paradigm and the need for defense profoundly engraved in the specific kind of Romanesque art we can find in Portugal: thick and menacing crenelated walls, towers, use of battlements, merlons, narrow slits and decorative austerity, like the church of Travanca Monastery with its heavy tower, the Monastery of Cete, the Church of Air√£es, S√£o Martinho de Mouros, Pa√ßo de Sousa Monastery and the Monastery of Rates, one of the most artistically diverse. Almost every religious building has a fortress-like design because in the absence of castles, churches were always considered the best fortresses. Church of S√£o Martinho de Mouros with its heavy and fortified structure. Therefore, it is not surprising that monastical buildings comprise most of the Romanesque kind, specially in the northern areas of Entre-Douro-e-Minho, T√¢mega and Sousa valleys and along the Douro river margins. With a significant rural population dispersed within these regions and organized in villages or concelhos we also find a significant number of parish churches, like S√£o Gens de Boelhe, S√£o Vicente de Sousa, S√£o Pedro de Ferreira or Santa Maria de C√°rquere Being very simple and small constructions, it is astonishing how each of them have such an iconographic variety of decorative features, being another unique \\"indigenous\\" characteristic of Portuguese Romanesque. Portuguese Romanesque churches have a longitudinal structure, following the basilical plan common throughout Europe: three aisles, transept and apse with two apsidoles, either semi-circular or square shaped, or just with one single aisle and apse. With semi-circular apse and apsidoles we have the churches of Ganfei, Rates, Pombeiro, S√£o Tiago of Coimbra and Castro de Avel√£s. The churches of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o de Rio Mau and Santa Eul√°lia de Arnoso, among others, present a square-shape apse and apsidoles.

Interiors Interior of the church of Monastery of Rates seen towards the main chapel, with its wooden roof and pointed arches. Most Romanesque monasteries, parish churches and abbey churches in Portugal are aisless halls with a projecting apse at the chancel end, or sometimes, a projecting rectangular chancel with a chancel arch that might be decorated with mouldings. More ambitious churches have aisles separated from the nave by arcades. The apse is lower or at the same height of the nave. Monasteries are usually larger with 3 aisles supported by decorated columns and piers. The walls are of massive thickness with few and comparatively small openings and almost entirely made out of granite stones. Arcades can occur in storeys or stages. While the arcade of a cloister is typically of a single stage, the arcade that divides the nave and aisles in a church is typically of two stages, with a third stage of window openings known as the clerestory rising above them. Arcading on a large scale generally fulfils a structural purpose, but it is also used, generally on a smaller scale, as a decorative feature, both internally and externally where it is frequently \\"blind arcading\\" with only a wall or a narrow passage behind it. S√£o Pedro de Ferreira Monastery with small openings and carved capitals. The arches used in Portuguese Romanesque buildings follow the basic European model and are nearly always semicircular, for openings such as doors and windows, for vaults and for arcades. Wide doorways are usually surmounted by a semi- circular arch, except where a door with a lintel is set into a large arched recess and surmounted by a semi-circular lunette with decorative carving. These doors sometimes have a carved central jamb. Narrow doors and small windows might be surmounted by a solid stone lintel. Larger openings are nearly always arched. A characteristic feature of Portuguese Romanesque architecture, both ecclesiastic and domestic, is the pairing of two arcade openings, separated by a pillar or colonette and often set within a larger arch. There were some number of buildings in which pointed arches have been used extensively, apparently for stylistic reasons and it is believed that in these cases there is a direct influence of Mozarabic and/or Islamic architecture. At other late Romanesque churches the pointed arch was introduced as a structural device in ribbed vaulting. Its increasing application was fundamental to the development of Gothic architecture. Interior of the Church of S√£o Pedro de Rubi√£es seen towards the main entrance, with its wooden roof. Although basically rectangular, piers can often be of highly complex form, with half-segments of large hollow-core columns on the inner surface supporting the arch, or a clustered group of smaller shafts leading into the mouldings of the arch. Piers that occur at the intersection of two large arches, such as those under the crossing of the nave and transept, are commonly cruciform in shape, each arch having its own supporting rectangular pier at right angles to the other. Columns, colonnettes and attached shafts are also used structurally and for decoration. Arcades of columns cut from single pieces are also common in structures that do not bear massive weights of masonry, such as cloisters, where they are sometimes paired. The majority of buildings have wooden roofs, generally of a simple truss, tie beam or king post form. In the case of trussed rafter roofs, they are sometimes lined with wooden ceilings in three sections like those that survive at the monasteries of Rates or Pa√ßo de Sousa. Some others are completely barrel vaulted or a mix between wooden roofs and a vaulted apse. In later stages rib vaulting started to be used as an experiment in main altar roofs.

File:Mosteiro_de_Sanfins_de_Friestas.jpgMain altar and nave of the church of Sanfins de Friestas, the narrow lateral and front windows are another Romanesque trademark. Portals Church of Santiago in Coimbra has columns decorated with detailed motifs. Romanesque churches generally have a single portal centrally placed on the west front, the focus of decoration for the facade of the building, and both the largest and the smallest, had lateral entrances that were commonly used by worshippers. Doorways have a character form, with the jambs having a series of receding planes, into each of which is set a circular shaft, all surmounted by a continuous abacus. Travanca Monastery has a pointed arch portal, a feature that would later be developed in Gothic architecture. The semi-circular arch which rises from the abacus has the same serried planes and circular mouldings as the jambs. The arch consists typically of four planes containing three shafts, but there may be as many as twelve shafts, symbolic of the apostles. The opening of the portal may be arched, or may be set with a lintel supporting a tympanum, generally carved. A carved tympanum generally constitutes the major sculptural work of a Romanesque church. The subject of the carving on a major portal may be Christ in Majesty or the Last Judgement. Lateral doors may include other subjects such as the Birth of Christ. The portal may be protected by a porch, from simple open porches to more elaborate structures. The religious context of the art at the time was well noticeable in the churches carvings, both inside the church as outside. They showed several episodes of the life of saints and various myths and biblical stories. Those that were sculptured specially in the tympanums, capitals and collonettes of the portals can be divided into two major themes: * Representations of apotropaic motifs, such as crosses and esoteric symbols. * Representations of Theophanies or \\"Maiestas Domini\\" (Christ in Majesty) such as \\"Agnus Dei\\" (the mystical lamb trespassed by a cross) or Christ in mandorla surrounded by prophets, angels and tetramorphs.

Capitals The foliate Corinthian style provided the inspiration for many Romanesque capitals, and the accuracy with which they were carved depended very much on the availability of original models, being some much closer to the Classical than others. Vegetalist capitals at the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Orada. The Corinthian capital is essentially round at the bottom where it sits on a circular column and square at the top, where it supports the wall or arch. This form of capital was maintained in the general proportions and outline of the Romanesque capital. This was achieved most simply by cutting a rectangular cube and taking the four lower corners off at an angle so that the block was square at the top, but octagonal at the bottom. This shape lent itself to a wide variety of superficial treatments, sometimes foliate in imitation of the source, but often figurative, without forgetting that the kind of stone used for construction of Romanesque churches in Portugal was mostly granite which made the carving of intricate and sharp details much harder. Santiago Church. It is however in the figurative capitals that the greatest originality is shown. While some are dependent on manuscripts illustrations of Biblical scenes and depictions of beasts and monsters, others are lively scenes of the legends of local saints, all of those with a deep religious meaning and pedagogical objective of teaching the faithful ones about virtues and sins guiding them through the right path. Another important aspect of the iconography represented in capitals throughout the Portuguese Romanesque buildings are the scenes of daily life or mundane events such as musicians playing instruments, acrobats performing stunts, people dancing. Also, scenes representing the several economical activities of that period like peasants planting crops, farm animals (cows, sheep, goats, horses, etc.), as well as the social medieval hierarchy displaying knights, bishops and peasants each performing specific tasks according to their social positions.

Corbels and Modillions The \\"horn blower\\" at Braga Cathedral. In Romanesque architecture a corbel is a structural piece of stone jutting from a wall to carry a superincumbent weight, a type of bracket. The technique of corbelling, where rows of corbels deeply keyed inside a wall support a projecting wall or parapet, has been used since Neolithic times. A modillion is an ornate bracket, a corbel, underneath a cornice and supporting it, more elaborate than dentils (literally translated as small teeth), they were carved classically under a Corinthian or a Composite cornice, but may support any type of eaves cornice. Sanfins de Friestas Church. Corbels in Portuguese Romanesque buildings often have an elaborately carved appearance with stylised heads of humans, animals and imaginary \\"beasts\\", or a wide range of motifs, sometimes end with a point apparently growing into the wall, or forming a knot, and often are supported by angels and other figures. In later periods the carved foliage and other ornaments used on corbels resembled those used in the capitals of columns. Another particular feature of Romanesque buildings are corbel tables, a projecting moulded string course supported by a range of corbels. Sometimes these corbels carry a small arcade under the string course, the arches of which are pointed and trefoiled. As a rule corbel tables carries the gutter, but the arcaded corbel table was also used as a decoration to subdivide the storeys and break up the wall surface. In some buildings corbels will form a moulding, and above a plain piece of projecting wall forming a parapet.

Apses (East ends) and apsidoles Simple square east end on the'Chapel of Santo Abd√£o. One of the most striking features of a Romanesque church is its apse or \\"east-end\\", a recess covered with a hemispherical vault or semi-dome, also known as an Exedra, applied to a semi-circular or polygonal termination to the choir or aisles of a church at the liturgical east end (where the altar is), regardless of the shape of the roof, which may be flat, sloping, domed, or hemispherical. Apses and apsidoles can be either semi-circular, with or without a high chancel surrounded by an ambulatory, or a square end from which an apse is projected. Apsidoles can also be found whenever the main altar is surrounded by lateral chapels. Church of Armamar already has a semi-circular apse. Churches in Portugal have long since followed the Pre-Romanesque kind of simple square-shaped apses typical of Visigothic and Mozarabic periods where east ends reflected the common structural plan of single-aisled churches as the main altar is separated from the nave by a transept or is just the extension of it. This style continued to be popular through the Romanesque and well into Gothic period. Fully Romanesque semi-circular apses started being more widespread in the regions between Douro and Minho in the second quarter of the 12th century (1125‚Äì1150), coming from the center region of Coimbra that was more open to foreign novelties as stated above. This kind of so-called \\"French style\\" semi-circular apses and apsidoles became more frequent not only in single nave churches, on which case there are no apsidoles, but particularly in three-aisled churches and monasteries built in the second half of the 12th century and during the 13th century.

File:Mosteiro_de_Travanca_PM_33621.jpgTravanca Monastery has double round apsidoles surrounding a square-shape apse. Cloisters Coimbra Cathedral, arcades and columns are Romanesque but its roof already presents a ribbed vault. A cloister (from Latin claustrum, \\"enclosure\\") is a covered walk, open gallery, or open arcade running along the walls of buildings and forming a square or garth. The attachment of a cloister to a cathedral or church, commonly against a warm southern flank, usually indicates that it is (or once was) part of a monastic foundation, forming a continuous and solid architectural barrier that effectively separates the world of the monks from that of the serfs and workmen, whose lives and works went on outside and around the cloister. Monastery of Cete cloister have simple composite capitals with no decorations. Although much of the cloisters in Portuguese churches and cathedrals have been extensively remodelled in later centuries, original Romanesque ones still survived, some almost completely preserved, others in various states of ruin. In contrast to their French counterparts, they often have suffered less modern intervention, and as a result, their current state is more likely to reflect their original arrangement and to preserve more fully the character of the visual imagery found there. Most arcades and masonry walls of the cloister carries simple wooden shed roofs as barrel or groin vaulted ceilings weren't common or likely didn't survived into our days. When ribbed vaults were introduced, the columns were articulated by multiple applied shafts, with smaller arcades in the openings to the garth. Cloisters provided special accommodation for the activities that took place within it: stone benches were used for reading, books were sometimes stored in cupboards or armoires built into the walls. In addition, the cloister often contained a fountain or well, where the monks could wash and draw water to drink. The single, double, and even triple and quadruple capitals of 12th-century cloisters' columns were carved with foliate forms derived from the Classical period, such as vine scrolls and acanthus leaves, real and imaginary animals in combat or in heraldic positions, secular images such as musicians, entertainers, hunters, saints' lives and biblical events. Piers bore narrative scenes or relief figures of apostles or saints. File:MachadodeCastroCloisters.png10th-century cloisters at National Museum Machado de Castro.

Cistercian Romanesque Tarouca Abbey copying the facade of the Abbey of Fontenay. The Cistercian Romanesque architecture reflected the austerity and sobriety characteristic of that monastical Order in their quest for a mistic and spiritual goal preached by their leader and mentor Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. In Portugal, besides a Cistercian Gothic-featured architecture (in which the Alcoba√ßa Monastery is a universal symbol), there is a previous Romanesque style expressed by the Abbeys of Tarouca (construction started in 1144, the year of Cistercian monks arrival in Portugal), Salzedas (started in 1152) and Fi√£es (started in 1163). Amares Abbey, one of the first of the Order of Cister in Portugal. In the architecture of Cistercian churches the transept is usually quite wide and the lateral aisles are covered with groined vaults that help to sustain the longitudinal central nave. There is a clear preference for square-shaped apses, more simple and economical to build. The columns and piers supporting pointed-arched arcades (already a proto- Gothic feature), have big strong capitals and stand on rectangular blocks on the ground floor. Although Tarouca Abbey was clearly inspired in the Burgundian abbeys of Clairvaux and Fontenay and Salzedas still have some similarities with Fontfroide, their authentic and magnificent Cistercian architectural features are mixed with local Portuguese decorative motifs. Some of smaller churches were also influenced by Cistercian Romanesque, like the vault of S√£o Martinho de Mouros that shows the influx of Tarouca's abbey central nave vault and the exterior capitals in the main altar of Armamar church are significantly influenced by the outlayer of Salzedas abbey.

The Domus Municipalis (Latin: municipal house) is a Romanesque building in the northeastern municipality of Bragan√ßa. Its exact function, name and construction date have been the onset of much debate and controversy, even after many researches during the 20th century: first it was believed it could have been the city's Municipal house (Portuguese: \\"Casa da C√¢mara\\"), place of public meetings and a symbol of people's local government through their representatives, but more recent findings have presented basis for a theory that it could have served as cistern, but there are still doubts if that was its primary function. Upper level where the town meetings took place (cistern drains in the centre ) This singular (and enigmatic) building of Romanesque civic architecture also presents challenges in its dating construction. An initial thesis stated that by its design and decorative features it could have been built as early as the 10th or 11th century, but a closer look actually tells us that was, most likely, built in the first half of the 13th century. Also, a deeper research showed that the existing building might be the result of two different dating constructions, with an older cistern on its lower floor and a meeting room built on top, using the already existing structure. Doubts about its real function arouse from a document of 1501 in which the author (according to the published writings of the Abbot of Ba√ßal (1865‚Äì1947)) referred to the local record of Martim Anes (1185‚Äì1254) who spoke of the construction of the Domus upper level during his lifetime. In this account he stated that it was used as a meeting place for the \\"good men\\" of the municipality. Corbel details show its Romanesque style although probably built in a later period. There is another document from 1503 referring to the building as both a Sala da √Ågua (English: Water-room) and a place where the town representatives gathered to discuss and sign contracts, therefore, it should not be surprising if this supposed double-function turns out to be correct. Its construction date also becomes more clear in face of this facts, art-historian Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida noted that by its medallions, the diamond-shaped openings and the layout of windows we can date the upper level by the end of the 13th century or beginning of the 14th century, in which its already archaic Romanesque architectural style can be explained with the need of a compromise with the pre-existent cistern. Located near the Castle's courtyard alongside the Church of Santa Maria, the structure is based on a multi-level irregular pentagon, constructed of rounded granite blocks and held together by mortar, with a barrel vaulted wooden roof supported by three arches and covered by tiles. Its floor-plan is slightly steeped and a natural water fountain was found in the Northwest corner at a low depth. File:Domus_Municipalis_5.jpgThe inferior corner of the Domus structure.

Towers and fortified houses Tower-House of S√£o Cipriano, near Guimar√£es. Remodelled in the 15th and 18th centuries, its tower and main building date back to the early 12th century. In sharp contrast to the reality throughout most of Europe, there are still some examples of Portuguese Romanesque civil architecture that survived to our days, specially the fortified noble residences or Domus Fortis (in Portuguese:\\"Casa-Torre\\"). Most are no longer more than single towers that stand out from more modern constructions carried out in the house that surrounds them, and many were remodelled in later Gothic and Renaissance styles, but their Romanesque features are still very much visible. These noble fortified manors were built within, or in the periphery, of feudal lands (Coutos or Honras), among agricultural fertile valleys. We can also find them in neighbouring areas of forests or mountain ranges where nobility could control new farm lands outside more occupied regions in which the purchase of new lands and titles was more difficult. Azevedo Tower-House, in Braga (13th century). Nowadays, like many manors, is a rural-tourism guest house. Among those we have the manors and towers of Vilar (Penafiel), Pousada (Guimar√£es), Dornelas in Braga, Oriz (Vila Verde), Lourosa do Campo (Arouca) and Quintela (Vila Real). In northern Portugal there were two kinds of fortified houses during the Middle Ages: the Manor house and the Domus Fortis. The manor house, associated with high and middle nobility, doesn't follow an architectural frame but are rather a cluster of different autonomous buildings, as opposite with the \\"Domus Fortis\\" that follows a specific kind of fortified structure which was originated by the last quarter of the 11th century becoming extensively widespread by the late 12th century and through the 13th and 14th centuries. This kind of model was adopted by the smaller ranks of nobility in search of social ascension in a way of displaying to local communities their newly acquired power. Pinheiro fortress-house, built by late 14th and early 15h centuries still, near Guimar√£es. The Domus Fortis is composed by several divisions:  The most important being the Tower, of square plan (round ones were rare in Portugal), fortifying the house and offering protection to their owners and respective servants in case of need. It was built with four levels, each corresponding to a single division. Just like a keep tower in castles, the main gate was accessed by the first floor rather than the ground floor. This ground floor was the reception and living room, as the upper floors were destined for private chambers.  A \\"domus fortis\\" also had a separate building coupled with or close to the tower, with rectangular plan and two floors. Those were usually the servants area and accommodations.  In some cases is reported the existence of a private chapel like in Vasconcelos Tower- house. Also other individual structures, like kitchens, were built close to water springs or small streams. No remains are left from these buildings although their existence if fully documented. Most of tower-houses were built in northern and central regions of Portugal that belonged to feudal areas. Some were progressively restored in later centuries reflecting more modern Renaissance and Baroque styles: like Agui√£, Refoios, Gomariz, Castro, Faral√£es and Barbosa Tower-Houses. In other cases their towers were separated from the main building like Silva, Quintela, Oriz and Penegate Towers, among others.

Construction activity of bridges during the Middle Ages is directly related to the need of restoring the old Roman road system that was already obsolete, in order to develop new connections and boost trading. Since the end of the 11th century that need was so urgent that building bridges and restoring the paveways were activities that started to be considered as pious. S√£o Gon√ßalo of Amarante and S√£o Louren√ßo Mendes, sponsors of the construction of Amarante and Cav√™s bridges, respectively, were called saints by popular acclamation, such as Saint Benizet of Avignon (France) or S√°n Domingos da Cal√ßada (La Rioja (Spain)), showing how much this phenomenon of bridge and road construction were considered extremely important elsewhere in Europe. Porto Bridge over the C√°vado River, built in the 11th century. In the will of monarchs, noblemen and clergymen there are many references to donations for building bridges, King D.Afonso Henriques (1109‚Äì1185) himself contributed to the construction of Coimbra, Ave and Piares (Douro river) bridges. The stonemasons of the Romanesque period were more careful about the structural design and maintenance of bridges than their previous Roman counterparts, and looked for more solid grounds to build them, and because of that, according to Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida, medieval bridges resisted better against the danger of floodings and the test of time. Prado Bridge over the C√°vado River, although originally Roman it was rebuilt in the early 12th century. Romanesque bridges present large arches whose height had to be balanced with the use of abutments at each end by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. Bridge builders also improved on the Roman structures by using narrower piers, thinner arch barrels and lower span-rise ratios. Examples of these are the bridges of Lagoncinha (12th century), over the Ave River, with six arches, Prado bridge over the C√°vado River (11th century), with nine arches and Cav√™s bridge over the T√¢mega River (13th century). Bridge building deeply shaped the Portuguese medieval landscape. Among the Romanesque civil architecture and by the economical and technical means used for their construction, the building of bridges had the most impact in everyday life, benefiting communication between people.

Castles Guimar√£es Castle, built in the 10th century, its current look is the result of late 13th-century enlargements. In Portugal, castles are directly related with military needs and the state of continuous warfare characterised by the Reconquista. Populations living closer of the border between Christians and Muslims were under threat of constant raids and the advance of either sides in pursue of territorial conquest. The region more precociously fortified was the area south of the Douro river, where in the 10th century almost all the population centers had their castle. The majority of these defensive positions, the rural castles, were of very simple structure and took advantage of natural conditions such as high places with granite outcrops, that made access difficult. During the next three centuries (10th to 13th centuries) we witness a boom of castles due to the ever-growing necessity to provide a territorial passive defense. Arnoia Castle, built in the late 11th century, offered protection to a nearby monastery. The strength of a Romanesque castle sits in the thickness and height of its walls in order to resist sieges. The Allure or round-path (Portuguese: Adarve) was intertwinned with towers in order to break continuous cloths of wall and in the 12th century other outer sets of walls were built next to castles themselves to shelter populations and cattle as attested in the Castle of Castro Laboreiro. The Romanesque castle testifies to the triumph of rural nobility and is also the symbol of a territory's safety. During this period it consisted of a wall with allures, battlements and a central tower: the Keep, symbol of feudal power, and the biggest innovation to the fortress. This element has its origins in the domus fortis, the strengthened noble residence. Main gate of Lindoso Castle and its drawbridge. Between the North and the South of Portugal, particularly in the regions defined by the margins of the Mondego and Tejo Rivers, there are notable differences in military structures. In the North castles have a more basic structure and are very tied to fortifications typified in pre-Romanesque era. Going southwards castles display more advanced techniques in the field of military architecture. The strategic area was then concentrated on the border with the Moors where the Military Orders would play a key role. In the North we can find the castles of Lanhoso, Castro Laboreiro, Lindoso, Melga√ßo, Arnoia, Pena de Aguiar, Trancoso, Vilar Maior, and the most outstanding Guimar√£es Castle. This fortress, documented since around 950 AD, had undergone restoration works during the reign of D.Afonso Henriques and later changes in its layout in the Gothic period. Battlements and the round- path at P√≥voa de Lanhoso Castle, late 11th century. Built under the tenure of Gualdim Pais as Master of the Knights Templar (1157‚Äì1195), the castles of Pombal (c.1156), Tomar (1160), Monsanto (1165), Penas Roias (1166), Almourol (1171) and Longroiva (1174) demonstrate the importance of the Templars in the development of Portuguese military architecture during the second half of the 12th century. The first document stating the Knights Templar presence in Portugal dates back to 1128, when Queen D.Teresa donated them the castle of Soure. Its keep, built on the north side of the fortress, retains a distinctive feature: the Alambor, a reinforced base for the tower using a stone-slanted ramp. This solution gives it greater strength and makes an assault on its walls harder to accomplish. This feature can also be seen in the Keep of Pombal Castle. At Tomar Castle, headquarters of the order in Portugal, the alambor was built along the outer walls of the fortification. With origins in the military architecture developed by the Crusaders in the Holy Land, this constructive technique was used in the castle of Sa√¥ne and the Krak des Chevaliers, both located in Syria, where Gualdim Pais was stationed between 1151 and 1156. It owns to the Templar Order some of the most innovative solutions that the Portuguese military architecture met throughout the 12th century.

Transition to Gothic architecture Church of Santa Maria do Olival, built by the Knights Templar around 1170, was one of the first buildings reflecting the newly arrived Gothic architecture maintaining a Romanesque structural shape. The arrival of the Cistercians in Portugal after 1142 coincided with the first steps on the development of the new Gothic artistical style in France. Those initial Gothic features (pointed arch, taller and slimmer columns, groin and rib vaults, flying buttresses and more windows), although still with much Romanesque flavour, were implemented in Cistercian abbeys as they matched the exact kind of austere and ascetic teachings preached by their leader and mentor Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. Church of S√£o Jo√£o do Alpor√£o, built by the Knights Hospitaller after 1185, also presents early Gothic features like the rose window or the non-decorated portal. Thus, in Portugal, the strong presence and popularity of Romanesque until later centuries meant that this decorative and architectural Cistercian model was the perfect basis for the slow change into Gothic style, without never completely cutting off with the previous Romanesque. Instead, these two styles merged in Portuguese architecture like nowhere else in Europe within a specific kind called Mendicant Gothic, typical of monastic buildings. Alcoba√ßa, one of the biggest Cistercian abbeys in the world, is the first fully Gothic building in Portugal, but it still has a heavy and austere exterior appearance, only balanced by its tall and massive rib vaulted central nave and aisles. Churches like Santa Maria dos Olivais in Tomar, or S√£o Jo√£o de Alpor√£o in Santar√©m are perfect examples of this Mendicant transitional period between the Romanesque and the definitive settle of Gothic style, which would only be a reality by the 14th and 15th centuries. √âvora Cathedral, where its massive buttresses give a very Romanesque look. √âvora Cathedral is another example of Romanesque/Gothic transition, combining both in a single monument. Built between 1186 and 1204 (but only fully completed by 1250) with a clear Romanesque outlook, it was again enlarged c. 1280‚Äì1340, this time in early Gothic style. The cathedral received several valuable additions through time, such as the cloisters (Gothic period ‚Äì 14th century), or its zimborium (dome), built in the late 13th century and another addition already showing the new Gothic features. Romanesque never truly ceased to be expressed in various ways both decorative and structural until as late as the 16th century, thus most historians name it as Resistance Romanesque, referring to a specific kind of buildings that present a very marked statement of this period even if mixed with later artistical styles (Gothic, Manueline, Renaissance). Some examples of those are the Churches of Caminha, (built in the late 15th century), Torre de Moncorvo (built in the early 16th century), and the Cathedral of Viana do Castelo (also from the 15th century). File:CaminhaMatrizChurch2.jpgChurch of Caminha (15th/16th centuries). Its Gothic and Manueline decorative motifs and Renaissance portal are flanked by a heavy Romanesque-like bell tower.
