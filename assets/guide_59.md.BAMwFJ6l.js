Pre-Portuguese era No concrete evidence has been found that Christianity prevailed in Goa before the Portuguese arrived, but it is believed that St. Bartholomew, one of the twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, brought and spread the Gospel in Konkan including Goa, just as St. Thomas had done in Kerala and Tamil Nadu in Southern India. Portuguese era The Se Cathedral is a cathedral dedicated to Catherine of Alexandria, located in Old Goa In the 15th century, the Portuguese explored the sea route to India and Pope Nicholas V enacted the Papal bull Romanus Pontifex. This bull granted the patronage of the propagation of the Christian faith in Asia to the Portuguese (see \\"Padroado\\") and rewarded them with a trade monopoly for newly discovered areas. After Vasco da Gama arrived at Calicut on the coast of Kerala in India in 1498, the trade became prosperous. In 1510, the Portuguese wrested Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur and finally established themselves in Goa. By 1544, they conquered the districts of Bardez and Salcette in Goa. The Portuguese however were not interested in proselytizing. After four decades, the Catholic Church threatened to open Asia for all Catholics. In 1534, the Archdiocese of Goa was established. Soon missionaries of the newly founded Society of Jesus were sent to Goa, which lead to conversion of many locals to Christianity. They offered rice donations for the poor, good positions in the Portuguese colonies for the middle class and military support for local rulers. In 1542, Francis Xavier, co-founder of the Society of Jesus, arrived in Goa. He observed that the newly converted Christians were practicing their old customs and traditions. The path of migration of Goan Catholics towards South Canara Many of the newly converted Goan Catholic ancestors of the present Mangalorean Catholic community fled Goa because of the Goa Inquisition introduced by the Portuguese in 1560. King Sebastian of Portugal decreed that every trace of Indian customs be eradicated through the Inquisition. But many Christians of Goa were attached to some of their ancient Indian customs and refused to abandon them. Those who refused to comply with the rules laid down by the Inquisition were forced to leave Goa and to settle outside the Portuguese dominion. About 7,000 of them, mostly Bammons (Brahmins) and Sarodis (Kshtriyas), fled Goa and Damaon. Most migrated to South Canara in what is called the \\"First Wave of Migration\\". The Scottish physician Francis Buchanan visited Canara in 1801. In his book, A Journey from Madras through the Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar (1807), he stated that \\"80,000 Goan Christians came and settled in South Canara at the invitation of the King of Bednore.\\" Later, this was identified as a probable mistake and should have read \\"8,000\\". However even this figure included the second emigration of Christians from Goa. The Sultan of Bijapur attacked Goa in 1571 and ended Portuguese influence in the region. The Bijapur sultans were especially known for their loathing of Christianity. Fearing persecution, many Catholics from Goa migrated to South Canara. This migration is referred to as the \\"Second Wave of Migration\\". The attacks of the Maratha Empire on Goa, during the mid 16th century, was also a cause of migration. In 1664, Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, attacked Kudal, a town north of Goa, and began his campaign for Goa. After Shivaji's death on 3 April 1680, his son Sambhaji ascended to the throne. The onslaught of Sambahji, along the northern territories of Goa, drove nearly all the Christians from their homelands, and most of them migrated to South Canara. This migration is referred to as the \\"Third Wave of Migration\\". During the later years, 1680-1707, the migration slowed because of the Moghul-Mahratta wars which kept Sambhaji busy, and some 10,000 Christians returned to Goa. Contents taken from Sarasvati's Children article, written by Joe Lobo, the President of the Goan Catholic Association in Florida. This article has been borrowed mainly from Alan Machado's above book. From the Bardez district of Goa, Jesuit priests estimated that 12,000 Christians migrated to the South of Goa between 1710‚Äì1712. A Goa Government report of 1747 recorded that around 5,000 Christians fled to South Canara from the Bardez and Tiswadi districts of Goa during the invasion of the Marathas. It was estimated that during the Maratha raids on Goa, about 60,000 Christians migrated to South Canara. Modern era In 1787, inspired by the French Revolution, several Goan Catholic priests, unhappy with the process of promotion within the Church and other discriminatory practices of the Portuguese, organized the Pinto Revolt against the Portuguese. Though it was an unsuccessful revolt, it was the first open revolt against the Portuguese from within Goa. Britain gained control of Goa twice, the first time in 1797‚Äì1798 and the second time from 1802‚Äì1813. In 1843, the capital was moved to Panjim and by the mid-18th century the area under occupation by the Portuguese expanded to Goa's present day limits. By this time the Portuguese Empire started declining and further resistance to their occupation in Goa started gaining momentum. After the rest of India gained independence in 1947 Portugal refused to relinquish Goa. On 18 December 1961, India moved in with troops and after hostilities that lasted 36 hours, forced the Portuguese administration to surrender. On 30 May 1987, Goa was elevated as India's 25th state. During the 1970s, coastal communication increased between Bombay and Goa, after introduction of ships by the London- based trade firm Shepherd. These ships facilitated the entry of Goan Catholics to Bombay.

He won three caps for Wales and was the only Welsh representative on the 1903 British Isles tour. Career Skrimshire was born in Crickhowell in 1878, and educated at Monmouth School. He became a civil engineer who worked mainly in Ceylon, Southern Africa and India. Employed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office he built railways and bridges in the former British Empire, his most notable work being the railway from Johannesburg to the Victoria Falls, including the famous bridge over the falls. He died at Swan Dean Hospital in High Salvington, England in 1963.  Rugby career  After playing his early rugby with Blaenavon he moved to first class side Newport. He made his Newport debut against English side Moseley in 1897, and in his first season scored 16 tries in 24 matches, a good return for a centre. Skrimshire was regarded as a fast and agile runner who had a cool head and good positional ability, though he was noted as being greedy with the ball and needed to release more to his wing players. Skrimshire was first selected for Wales against England on 9 January 1899 at St Helens in front of a Welsh record crowd of 20,000.Godwin (1984), pg 55. Wales ran out comfortable winners and Skrimshire was back in the team for the Scotland game two months later. Although Wales lost the match against Scotland, he retained his place for the final game of the 1899 tournament against Ireland. Ireland won the a much disrupted game, caused by crowd trouble, and took the Triple Crown. It would be Skrimshire's last match for Wales.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The building, which was designed by John Philpott Jones in the Gothic Revival style for the Bishop Auckland Town Hall and Market Company, was financed by private issue of shares and officially opened on 28 October 1862. When it opened facilities included a large lecture hall capable of accommodating 800 people and a temperance hotel. The building held a prominent position in the town and dominated the area with its strong mansard pavilions, spires and associated ironwork. The mansard pavilions were an unusual feature imported from France which were copied a few years later by Bellamy and Hardy in their design for Retford Town Hall. The building was acquired by the local board of health in 1888 and it became the headquarters of Bishop Auckland Urban District council in 1894. Sir Edward Elgar visited the building on 2 December 1919 and conducted the Leeds Symphony Orchestra playing a series of pieces of his own work. After Bishop Auckland Urban District Council was abolished in 1974, the building was abandoned and then condemned for demolition in the 1980s; however, after a local campaign to save the building, it was fully restored in the early 1990s. The works included the conversion of the main assembly hall into a facility known as the Eden Theatre to commemorate a previous theatre of that name in Newgate Street which had been demolished in 1974. The changes also introduced a new public library, an art gallery, a tourist information centre and a caf√©. The complex was officially re-opened in September 1993 and the restoration in the complex was recognised with a Civic Trust Award in 1995. The art gallery went on to hold three exhibitions for mining artist Tom Lamb. The first was held in 1999 for his \\"Fading Memories\\" exhibition, then in 2004 for Lamb's \\"The Footprints Of My Years\\" exhibition and in 2008 the last exhibition called \\"My Mining Days\\" was held. The building closed for a further refurbishment involving a new layout to the art gallery and expected to cost ¬£1.9 million in September 2019.

Plot  Jim Buchanan (Marshall), wealthy president of Buchanan Motor Company, is engaged to Evelyn Fletcher (Inescort), a bossy socialite who is interested in Jim for his money. When Jim's fellow executives reject his plan to introduce a new automobile design, he decides to take a vacation. Declaring himself \\"sick and tired of everything\\", Jim goes for a walk in the park, where he meets a young woman named Joan Hawthorne (Arthur). Joan is having trouble finding a job and has just been evicted from her apartment. Assuming he is also a job hunter, she asks Jim to pose as her husband so they can apply for a combined job opening for a butler and a cook. Without revealing his true identity, he agrees. \\"Mr. and Mrs. Burns\\" are soon hired by Michael Rossini (Carrillo). She is a good cook; he improves his skills by sneaking away at night and taking lessons from his own butler. He also goes to his office and takes some of his automobile sketches from a safe to show to Joan. Impressed by his designs, on their day off she shows them to an executive with one of Buchanan's competitors, but he recognizes Buchanan's style, leading to her arrest for theft. Having fallen in love with Jim, she refuses to help the police find him. Meanwhile, Jim has decided to tell Joan who he is. When she misses a lunch date while in jail, he writes her a letter, abandons his butler position, and returns to Evelyn and his life as a businessman. Rossini, who has just organized a bootlegging gang, learns of Jim's trip to the office from his assistant, Flash (Stander), who is suspicious of Jim and has been tailing him. Wanting Joan for himself, he has her bailed out and tells her the truth about Jim. She reacts by raging against Jim, so Rossini promptly orders his henchmen to kill Jim at his wedding. To ingratiate himself with Joan, he tells her about this, but she declares that she loves Jim after all and begs Rossini to spare his life. Rossini's men abduct Jim from the wedding as he is about to take his vows, but Rossini arrives before they leave. He and his men take Jim home at gunpoint and fetch a justice of the peace to marry Jim and Joan. Joan refuses and locks herself in her room, but Jim embraces the plan. Since Rossini's men were seen kidnapping him, he blackmails the gang into persuading her to change her mind. Outside Joan's room, Rossini pretends to argue with Jim, Flash fires his gun in the air, and Jim collapses onto the floor, pretending to be hit. The deception works: Joan opens the door and rushes to his side.

Jean Arthur, a genuinely versatile player, could not quite lend the sparkle to the role of the girl which it conceivably deserved.\\" Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a negative review.

However, pure endmembers are very rare, with often either one of the mentioned cations dominating the composition. Thus, the formula can be written in such a way to express common intermediary gedrite samples: (Mg,Fe)2+2(Mg,Fe)2+3Al2(Al2Si6O22)(OH)2. Divalent manganese (Mn) may substitute for some of the magnesium. Trivalent or ferric iron, or titanium4+ may replace some of the aluminum (Al).

The album includes the duo's biggest hit single to date, \\"Solo Se Vive Una Vez\\" (\\"You Only Live Once\\"). Esclava De Tu Piel was entirely recorded in the United States and was produced by one of Gloria Estefan and Emilio Estefan Jr.'s longtime collaborators, arranger and producer Ricardo \\"Eddy\\" Martinez (a.k.a. Edito). Martinez has worked with some of the biggest names in the world of Latin music besides Estefan and Miami Sound Machine, such as Chayanne, Yolandita Monge, Lissette, Luis Miguel, Javier Garcia, Mal√∫, Paloma San Basilio, Arturo Sandoval, Ilan Chester, Latin Majik, Francesca Cezan and many others. After two albums in the mainstream Latin pop genre, Ojos Negros (1992) and El Amor (1994), which had become their breakthrough on the South American and U.S. markets respectively, but which only had been moderate commercial successes compared to Bandido (1990) and Mambo (1991) in their native Spain, Martinez' production of Esclava De Tu Piel was a return to a more up-to-date, dancefloor oriented and altogether rougher soundscape, the prime example being the title track \\"Esclava De Tu Piel\\" which combined heavy dance beats with distorted guitars and toasting by American Salsa singer Roberto Blades. The lead single released from the album was the dancehall influenced \\"Solo Se Vive Una Vez\\", written by Spanish singer Miguel Gallardo and Luis Caba√±as, promoted by a slightly controversial genderswapping music video showing the Salazar sisters both as themselves and in other scenes in typical male attire such as pin-striped suits with slicked back hair and smoking cigars - and in turn one of their male dancers both as himself and as a drag queen. The song was released in a wide variety of dance remixes, issued on two separate singles entitled The Mediterranean Remixes and The Caribbean Remixes. \\"Solo Se Vive Una Vez\\" became a major hit in the summer of 1996, topping the charts both in Spain and several countries in South and Central America, and has since served as one of Az√∫car Moreno's signature tunes. In the 2000s the track was included on the first Spanish language editions of karaoke video game SingStar. The follow-up proved to be another of Az√∫car Moreno's highest charting singles; \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas De Ti\\" (translated: \\"Today I Desire You\\"), originally one of Miguel Gallardo's biggest hits and first recorded in 1975, but then as a dramatic ballad. The duo's version was again notably different from the original, turning it into a modern dance anthem with rough guitars. The promo video was shot in New York and shows the sisters performing the song in the streets of the city as well as on top of skyscrapers. The following single release was the title track \\"Esclava De Tu Piel\\", which turned into their third big hit single in a row, and the track was also issued in remixed form on a release entitled The Slave Mixes. Esclava De Tu Piel was also Az√∫car Moreno's first album to incorporate influences from the Middle East; the fourth single was a radically reworked flamenco/rock/dance cover of the traditional \\"Hava Nagila\\", sung entirely in Hebrew with a men's choir. Just like the preceding singles the track was available in a large number of dance remixes, issued on the Hava Naguila - The Middle Eastern Remixes release. The chart success of the album and its singles even resulted in a fifth single being released in Spain, Pedro Rilo's flamenco flavoured \\"Bandolero\\". As a contrast to the album's dance tracks it also featured a few R&B; flavoured ballads, such as \\"Enreda\\", composed by acclaimed British hitmaker Albert Hammond and originally recorded in both Spanish and English, then as \\"Tangled Up In Tears\\", by Hammond himself in 1976, and later also covered by Leo Sayer. Further mid-tempo tracks include \\"Tapame\\", written by Sevillan singer-songwriter Luis del Estad, a cover of Willie Gonzalez' romantic salsa \\"√Åmame Toda La Noche\\", Alejandro Jaen's \\"La Cita\\" and the album closes with Cordoban flamenco singer Manuel Ruiz Queco's \\"Tiritatando\\". Esclava De Tu Piel remains the bestselling album of Az√∫car Moreno's career to date, having sold some five hundred thousand copies in Spain alone and thus certified five times platinum. In the United States the album reached #43 on Billboards Top Latin Albums chart.[ All Music Esclava De Tu Piel] The duo's first greatest hits album, Mucho Az√∫car - Grandes √âxitos, followed in 1997 and then included \\"Solo Se Vive Una Vez\\", \\"Hoy Tengo Ganas De Ti\\" and \\"Esclava De Tu Piel\\". The Esclava De Tu Piel album itself was re-released with slightly revised cover art by Sony Music in 1998 under the title Latin Stars.

It announced the abolition of tribute payment by the Indians of New Spain, which, it was hoped, would reduce Indian support for the rebellion. Although Venegas stated that Nahuatl was used simply to reach as many Indians as possible, relatively few speakers of Nahuatl were literate, and those that were usually could also read Spanish or Latin.Morris (2007): p. 453.

It is directed by Philippe Falardeau and is adapted from Bruno H√©bert's novels C'est pas moi, je le jure! and Alice court avec Ren√©.Official website of the movie . The film's soundtrack contains original songs composed by Montreal musician Patrick Watson. It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, the Berlin International Film Festival, and the Kingston Canadian Film Festival. Synopsis The story begins with a boy hanging himself in a tree, for fun. L√©on is a 10-year-old kid, with a tendency to vandalize, lie, prank, steal or even attempt suicide. He is not necessarily suicidal, but to escape punishments for his other deeds, he uses the suicide trick to get out of blame. When his parents were fighting, he sets fire to the bed, simply to make them stop. The story circulates around the evolving love of L√©on, and another girl who lives next door, whose name is Lea. She is regularly beaten by her uncle, and dreams of a normal childhood, specifically showing a desire for Barbie dolls. Their love proves to be difficult however, as at first Leon cannot admit that he likes her, but when he confesses his love, Lea throws him off by replying that she too loves herself. L√©on's mother moves away when she and her husband have had a big argument, and leaves the next day for Greece. L√©on and his brother struggle to accept this, and try several different ways to get in touch with her, such as running away to Greece, ringing her, or trying to find her home address. Leon follows Lea's plan to go to Greece but really Lea wants to look for her father. Lea runs off to look for her father but her father moved over a year ago, according to the woman living in the house where he once lived. Leon and Lea return but Leon's father is furious and Leon jumps off a high ledge to attempt suicide but fails. One day, a woman who resembles L√©ons mother arrives from Greece, and delivers both messages and gifts from her. She is most probably a daughter. She also secretly gives L√©on's brother the telephone number for her mother, and he telephones her many times in the dead of night; leaving expensive bills for L√©on (the chronic liar) to take blame for. The story ends with L√©on going to a local bowling alley where he often goes to spend time, but this time he places his head where the bowling ball hits the pins, and awaits the impact of the ball. Though he wakes up, and realizes that life may not be for him, but he is made for life.

The crest of Mount Kassidiaris is also visible. Kastri (, pron. Kastr√≠, from the Medieval Greek word for small castle or watchtower) is a village of the unit of Evrymenes, Zitsa municipality, Epirus, NW Greece. Until 1950 it was named Siutista, Renamed Settlements of Epirus and Thessaly, from the webpage of historian Dimitrios Lithoxoou. a name still in use by the local people. Location - Demographics Kastri lies 43 km northwest of Ioannina through a local road connected to the E92/E90 route (Ioannina - Igoumenitsa). Built at an elevation of 800 metres, it is the highest village of Mount Kassidiaris. According to the 2011 census the permanent inhabitants are 40 persons yet the actual number differs from the statistics. The number of the all-year-round inhabitants does not exceed that of 20, whatsoever. Nevertheless, this number rises after Eastertide, when some retired former villagers travel from their residence in Athens or Ioannina to their village to spend the summer period. This results in a significant increase in the number of Kastri's residents, often exceeding 100 during the August summer vacation period. History Kastri was founded by Souliotes fugitives as Siutista in the early 19th century; probably named after the adjacent mountain Kassidiaris, called Siutista at the time. The exact year is unknown, but it must have been soon after Ali Pasha conquered Souli (1803). The British topographer William Martin Leake mentions the village as Sh√∫tista in the 4th volume of Travels in Northern Greece,William Martin Leake ¬´Travels in Northern Greece, volume iv¬ª, page 94. Editions J. Rodwell, London, 1835. published in 1835, but saves no further information about it. Monument of that first period is the monastery consecrated to the Dormition of the Theotokos, situated at the northern edge of the village; today only the temple of the monastery survives. In the past it had also been asylum for people suffering from mental disorders. Typically the villagers of Kastri have always been stock-breeders. They also used to cultivate small amounts of corn, onion and vegetables for domestic use, since the mountainous soil was infertile for large scale farming. After the Second Balkan War and the annexation of Epirus in the Greek State (Treaty of Bucharest, 1913) the families were offered small arable properties in the nearby valley of Upper Thyamis, which previously belonged to Ottoman institutions (chifliks). The civil war of 1946-1949 triggered the first wave of immigration, when members of the defeated Democratic Army fled to the Eastern Bloc. This was followed by a second long- lasting wave in the following decades, during which most of the villagers immigrated to Athens or West Germany. The Temple of Dormition. A rather shy church today, it served as Katholikon for a monastery before the latter's collapse by a wildfire in 1944. The EEC subventions in the 80's provided some financial support for the few remaining inhabitants to keep on living in the village. At the same period, the connection with the rural road and electricity network encouraged some emigrant families to build houses in their fatherland for use in the summer months. Sightseeings The winding asphalt roadway driving to Kastri offers amazing view above the valley of Upper Thyamis as far Tymfi (...) such that otherwise only alpinists can enjoy.

Moreover, a footpath starting from the village leads to the highest peak of Kassidiaris (1329 m). The only sightseeing inside the village is the Temple of Dormition. Around the temple is held each year the traditional festival of the village (14‚Äì16 August) organised by the St. George Brotherhood, the fellowship of those born in or descended from Kastri. Another local celebration is the feast of St. George, who is considered as the village's patron saint.

Depending on the direction, trains would run either double headed or with a banker on the steep gradients. Once the switchbacks had been reached, each train was broken up and run in sections. Loaded trains then traveled to the D&RGW;'s yards at Salida, where the Stone was transferred to standard gauge gondola cars via a purpose built rotating 'barrel'. Once the branch was converted to standard gauge, trains ran double-headed with D&RGW; 4-axle EMD GP9s and in later days GP30s, GP35s and GP40s. During this period of operations, each train was broken up before the climb up the steep grades. 6-axle SD9s were tested on the branch but derailed due to the tight curves. Diesels assigned to the branch were given modified dynamic brakes to cope with the 4.5% grades.

The competition was run on a regional basis, with 17 regional associations holding separate qualification rounds. The winners of each of these qualification tournaments, along with the second-placed team from Auckland, qualified for the competition proper. In all, 91 teams took part in the competition, 32 from the South Island and 59 from the North Island. Note: Different sources record different numbers for the rounds of this competition, with some confusion caused by differing numbers of rounds in regional qualification. The 1966 final The final was the first since 1962 to feature no Auckland teams. Rangers had the stronger of the two finalist sides, with strong players such as goalkeeper Peter Whiting and brothers Les and Barry Taylor. In a gritty but largely uninspiring final, Western had most of the play, coming close to scoring on several occasions, with one goal disallowed and another shot hitting the woodwork. As the game progressed Rangers came into their own, taking the lead through a Les Taylor shot which hit the upright before ricocheting into the net. The ball had been the result of a parried clearance by Western keeper David Smith of a Stef Billing header. p. 74 Results Third round *match won by Wanganui East on corners Fourth round Fifth round Quarter-finals Semi-finals =Replay= Final References *Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation New Zealand 1966 page *ultimatenzsoccer.com 1966 Chatham Cup page Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Chatham Cup ","title":"1966 Chatham Cup"},{"id":"19109319","text":"SAFE (Save Animals From Exploitation) is a New Zealand animal rights group. SAFE's vision is to create an ethical Aotearoa (New Zealand) that ensures the rights of animals. Its purpose is to educate, inform and empower people to make cruelty-free, plant-based and vegan choices.  History  SAFE evolved out of an Auckland branch of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. This group was renamed Save Animals from Experiments, in 1972, and renamed again to Save Animals from Exploitation in 1987. Now known as SAFE, it is a registered charity and an incorporated society.  Structure  The organisation has annual and lifetime members and is governed by a Board of Directors. It has approximately 20 staff and 2,000 volunteers. There are SAFE offices in Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland. As SAFE is a charity, it is entirely dependent on donations from its supporters.  Politics  SAFE has received support from Auckland mayor John Banks and Mike King, former politician Tim Barnett, actress Robyn Malcolm, Gareth Hughes and Sue Kedgely from the Green Party. Leading up to the 2008 General Election, SAFE's Animal Welfare Policy Survey 2008 rated the country's political parties' animal welfare policies. SAFE Ambassador Hans Kriek declared that \\"the Green Party was a shining light having by far the best and most comprehensive animal welfare policy of any party in New Zealand\\". Ratings higher than 0 out of 10 were also given to United Future, the MƒÅori Party and the National Party. This could be construed as an endorsement of the Green Party, or of the National Party above the Labour Party.  Dairy industry campaigns In 2015, SAFE released footage that was secretly filmed of workers in the winters of 2014 and 2015 abusing bobby calves. One video showed truck drivers throwing calves roughly into a truck, while another showed a slaughterhouse worker kicking and beating calves before clubbing them to death. A number of workers were subsequently fired, with the slaughterhouse owner claiming that she wasn't informed of the abuse earlier. Following the airing of the videos on TV, SAFE supporters protested outside Fonterra's headquarters in Hamilton and SAFE . The slaughterhouse closed after being investigated by the Ministry of Primary Industries and the worker responsible for the abuse was sentenced to home detention. Shortly after the release of the video, SAFE ran an ad in The Guardian's Saturday edition, saying New Zealand dairy was \\"contaminated with cruelty\\". The ad read: \\"In New Zealand millions of newborn calves are taken from their mothers so that people can drink milk meant for them\\". The president of Federated Farmers responded saying that separating cows from calves \\"is simply the reality of dairy farming\\". New Zealand prime minister, John Key, said running the ad in Britain was \\"a form of economic sabotage\\".

He turned to schoolmastering, for which he quickly demonstrated a remarkable aptitude He taught in Parkes in rural New South Wales, and in 1897 founded his own small school in Bega, where he met and married Beatrice Ashdown in 1898. The marriage was a happy one and the couple had five children. In 1904, Rolfe began a nine-year stint as headmaster of Wolaroi Grammar, now Kinross Wolaroi School, in Orange. In 1908 he was at last ordained to the Anglican priesthood. After a time at St Peter's College in Adelaide, he became acting headmaster of Barker College in Sydney before founding his own school, Malvern School, in Hunters Hill, again in Sydney.

He rose to become Lord Chancellor of Scotland and was eventually murdered in 1595. Career He was the second son of Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree, by his wife Agnes, the daughter of John Cunningham, 5th of Capringtoun, Ayrshire. Stewart's sister, Margaret, was married to the reformer John Knox. In April 1573, James was sent as a \\"pledge\\" or hostage to England for the security of the English army and artillery sent to the \\"Lang Siege\\" of Edinburgh Castle, which was held by supporters of Mary Queen of Scots. Regent Morton gave him ¬£55 for his expenses in England.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 12, Edinburgh, HMSO (1970), 345, (393). He was Captain of the Royal Guard of James VI, served with the Dutch forces in the Netherlands against the Spanish, and returned to Scotland in 1579. James quickly became a favourite of the young king, and in 1580 was made Gentleman of the Bedchamber. He was a follower of Esm√© Stewart, and in January 1580 he accused the former Regent Morton, still the effective power in Scotland, of participation in the murder of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. Stewart was rewarded as Tutor of Arran, with powers over the earldom of the mentally-ill James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran, then made Earl of Arran on 22 April 1581. He also claimed the position of second person in the land through being nearest to the king by descent, other than the now-insane third earl. The new Earl often resided at the Hamilton's Kinneil House until after his own fall in the autumn of 1585, when he remained at Kinneil under house- arrest, and for a time Kinneil was called Arran House.CSP Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), p. 326. In July 1581 he married Elizabeth Stewart, the divorced former wife of the King's great-uncle, Robert Stewart, once Earl of Lennox and now Earl of March. Elizabeth, the Countess of Arran, was the daughter of John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl. The Lennox-Arran administration Esm√© Stewart was made Earl, then Duke, of Lennox, and he and Arran became partners in government, and rivals for the supremacy. Their government of Scotland, and their correspondence with France and Spain, made them unpopular in England and with the \\"ultra-Protestant\\" sector at home, although the young King greatly admired Lennox and enjoyed his company. Lennox and Arran disagreed over several issues, including the rehabilitation of Thomas Kerr of Ferniehirst in June 1581.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), p. 392. The Ruthven raid In August 1582 Lennox and Arran held the Privy Council at Perth, and then returned to Dalkeith Palace near Edinburgh. James VI was invited to stay hunting in Perthshire, and he was taken at Huntingtower Castle by the Earl of Gowrie and his political faction on 22 August 1582, a kidnap known as the Ruthven Raid. The next day they gave the King their supplication or mandate, which stated; > We have suffered now about the space of two years such false accusations, > calumnies, oppressions and persecutions, by the means of the Duke of Lennox > and him who is called the Earl of Arran, that the like of their insolencies > and enormities were never heretofore born with in Scotland. Arran went to Huntingtower and was arrested by the raiders. Lennox was sent in exile to France and died. Gowrie ran Scotland for ten months, after issuing an indictment against Lennox and Arran that included the detail that the Countess of Arran was \\"a vile and impudent woman, over famous for her monstrous doings, not without suspicion of the devilish magical art.\\" Arran was permitted to attend some council meetings to bolster support for the new regime.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol.3, Edinburgh (1880), pp.506-513 footnotes following Calderwood Arran had obtained a quantity of jewels belonging to James VI, or to his mother, Mary, Queen of Scots. On 28 May 1583 his wife Elizabeth Stewart, returned sets of pearl, ruby, and diamond buttons, to the Master of Gray, who was master of the king's wardrobe. Later, in 1585, they returned more royal jewels, including the \\"Great H of Scotland\\".Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 316-320. The Arran supremacy Arran assembled a force of 12,000 men and regained power in July 1583, an ascendancy that would last for two years, and the Ruthven Raiders and their followers were banished to Newcastle upon Tyne. Gowrie was executed. After May 1584, Arran was always recorded first in the lists of those attending the Scottish Privy Council. He became governor of Edinburgh Castle, provost of the city, and lieutenant-general of the royal army. He acted against the Presbyterian wing of the Scottish church, and the banished lords of the Ruthven Raid, who had returned to assault Stirling Castle. The role of his wife in the administration also attracted the censure of Edinburgh Kirk ministers. Arran was made keeper of Edinburgh Castle and in November 1584 he was ordered to survey the state of repair and faults in its fortifications, and prospect for a new well, according to \\"his experience and judgement in the art militaire.\\"David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), p. 705. As part of his strategy to maintain good relations with England, Arran sent copies of the king's poetry book, The Essayes of a Prentise in the Divine Art of Poesie, printed in Edinburgh by Thomas Vautrollier and bound in orange vellum, to Cecil and Lord Hunsdon on 28 December 1584.Sebastiaan Verweij, '\\"Booke, go thy wayes\\": The Publication, Reading, and Reception of James VI/I's Early Poetic Works', Huntington Library Quarterly, 77:2 (Summer 2014), pp. 111-131 at 115-6: Reliqui√¶ Antiqu√¶ Scotic√¶, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1848), p. 163 from BL Lansdowne MSS. Arran's rule was undermined in part by the machinations of his own diplomat in London, the young Master of Gray. By February 1585, Elizabeth opened two lines of communication in Scotland, one with Arran and another with the Master.Masson, David, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), introduction.

Arran fell from power after a border incident when the Englishman Francis Russell, son of the second Earl of Bedford, was killed with a \\"shot from a dag\\" on 27 July 1585. Arran was accused of involvement by the English ambassador, Nicholas Wotton and James VI on first hearing the news had offered to send Arran as a prisoner to England.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol.3, (1880), p.760 note. Instead Arran was imprisoned at St Andrews Castle and then placed in house arrest at his own Kinneil House. One account says he went from Kinneil to Ayr and embarked on a boat with the royal jewels including the Great H of Scotland or 'Kingis Eitche', but was forced to give the jewels to George Home.John W. Mackenzie, A Chronicle of the Kings of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 139. He was unable to prevent the Banished Lords of the Ruthven Raid returning from England, seizing Stirling Castle on 4 November 1586, and declaring him a traitor. Retirement and death Avoiding plans for his banishment, and despite being ordered to leave the country, he spent the rest of his life in retirement in Ayrshire.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 4 (1881), vi-x He did however remain in communication with James, and may have carried out some secret missions for him. In December 1592 Stewart came to Holyroodhouse and met the king by the kennels. He then entered the presence chamber where some called him 'Lord Chancellor' and then met Anne of Denmark and kissed her hand. However, James let it be proclaimed in churches that he would not employ Stewart again. The English ambassador Robert Bowes heard that his supporters included the Duke of Lennox, Sir George Home, James Sandilands, Colonel William Stewart, Thomas Erskine, and the Laird of Dunipace, who plotted his rehabilitation and the wreck and overthrow of the Chancellor John Maitland and the Hamilton family.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 819, 821.

When released for beta in Spring 2001 it was the first multiplayer online game to merge first person shooting and role- playing. The game had its full commercial release on July 1, 2003.http://pc.ign.com/objects/017/017346.html Originally developed and owned by Aaron Boucher and his independent Avaria Corporation, the game was sold as part of a game engine licensure agreement with Rapid Reality Studios,http://games.ign.com/objects/944/944703.html a now defunct game developer who tried to improve it by creating a sequel named Phylon. The sequel did not have a very good reception, and in July 2007 the game went off- line. In May 2008 a former Endless Ages player and an investor, doing business as Digital Motion Entertainment,http://www.aboutus.org/Endless-Ages.com acquired the rights to the game and re-released it in something similar to its gold version, calling it Endless Ages Reborn.  Back-story  Endless Ages takes place after you die‚Äîand begin to inhabit planet Iia *[(EYE-uh,) a takeoff of Jupiter's moon Io,] a world where all beings from all worlds, places and time end up. Because a few minutes on Iia is the same as hundreds of years in our time weapons, architecture, magic, technology, and even creatures that have been extinct to the world now coexist. * Some people dispute this and believe the planet should be pronounced Eye-eye-aye when the developers used all caps - IIA. Still others, however, believe that the developer's use of IIA was an oversight, as that would make it an acronym. It has never been suggested that IIA stands for anything. Unlike most MMOs, Endless Ages doesn't have a cohesive, fully articulated back-story. The game lore basically is about the four races; human male and female, amphibians and bloblics all vying independently of each other for control of the various worlds against the monsters, known as Mobs, of which there are hundreds who roam the land and guard their territory.  Worlds  One of the main features of Endless Ages is the vast amount of land which can be explored by the user. Many worlds exist, and all differ from each other. The worlds vary from being large islands, to treacherous caves, labyrinths and many more. There are also sub-worlds; small zones with a few dangerous and rare creatures. Most worlds have protected areas. In such areas, players cannot harm other players. They also cannot loot another player's possessions. In previous versions there were some buildable areas, where users could purchase and build their own houses.http://www.mmorpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID;=701 Houses allow users to place items in storage as well as placing some items for sale. The houses effectively form user-created towns, and market areas. The current licensee has been unable to restore the player owned-house feature.  Races  There are Four Races that inhabit Planet IIA, all of which serve a valuable purpose - to survive.  Amphibian  As a race that implements the regimen of nature, Amphibians live in the tranquility of a natural habitat, building temporary domiciles which blend into trees or caves. They are suspicious beings to a fault and are very well at hiding from view. As a race that implements the regiment of nature, other creatures within the realm are inevitably drawn to them as friends or guardians. They have the ability to dominate the minds of different creatures while devising a methodical connection with them. Above all others, Amphibians are stealthy and elusive. Standing at an average of 3 feet, they can easily evade stronger enemies and have a unique talent for eluding attention.  Female  The female possesses majestic, beauty and gracious talent, however take heed not to underestimate these beings. Deriving from the planet Earth, the female gender seeks an imperial state of existence. They retain great knowledge in Crafting skills and Magical Arts due to an extensive training. Unpredictable in their ventures, these individuals are acutely intelligent and incredibly swift. They are known for prolonged endurance and a forceful nature. Heroic in a sense, females are versatile and steady in all traditions. The average height is 5.5 feet and weight of 125 pounds.  Male  This generation of humanity is robust and well educated, originating from the planet earth. The males you find in this realm are of high caliber, physically and mentally. Geared for war, they are elite and accelerate in the development of Engineering skills, which can be used in Melee Arts. Conquering kingdoms of war, victory lies within these natural born leaders. They are clever in political affairs and exploit human principles on an intellectual level. The average male stands at a height of 6.5 and weighs about 200 pounds.  Bloblic  The Bloblic race is the most antagonistic of all inhabitants within the Omnir Galaxy. They reign with immoral vitality and utmost greed in their home world, Malia. The sheer mention of the Bloblics sends fear through all those who are against this species. Bloblics are known as mercenaries by trade. They are astute in developing weapons of mass destruction and gain skill quite rapidly. These marauders are focused combatants that fight at frantic paces and are not very graceful to observe. Due to their size and nature, these beings can sustain more injury than any other race. They are hulking figures to gaze at, standing at an average of 12.3 feet and weighing approximately 1200 pounds.  Skills  Endless Ages has a wide variety of skills. The different races will also find certain skills easier or harder to master. For example, Bloblics are greatly disadvantaged in hiding, unlike the Amphibians.

Description  The System Deployment Image (SDI) file format is often used to allow the use of a virtual disk for startup or booting. Some versions of Microsoft Windows allow for \\"RAM booting\\", which is essentially the ability to load an SDI file into memory and then boot from it. The SDI file format also lends itself to network booting using the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE). Another usage is hard disk imaging. The SDI file itself is partitioned into the following sections: ; Boot BLOB : This contains the actual boot program, STARTROM.COM. This is analogous to the boot sector of a hard disk. ; Load BLOB : This typically contains NTLDR and is launched by the boot BLOB. ; Part BLOB : This contains the actual boot runtime (i.e. the contents of the disk image including any Operating System [OS] files) and also includes the boot.ini (used by NTLDR) and ntdetect.com files which should be located within the root directory of the runtime. The size of the runtime cannot exceed 500 MB. In addition to this requirement the runtime must also be capable of dealing with the fact that it is booting from a ramdisk. This implies that the runtime must include the \\"Windows RAM Disk Driver\\" component (specified within the boot.ini). ; Disk BLOB : This is flat HDD image starting with a MBR. It is used for hard drive imaging instead of booting. Also only Disk BLOBs can be mounted with Microsoft's utilities. SDI usually contains either Disk BLOB (HD cloning or temporary SDI) or three other of them (bootable SDI). Windows Vista or Windows PE 2.0 boot sequence includes a boot.sdi file, which contains Part BLOB for an empty NTFS volume and a Table- of-Contents slot for the WIM image, which is stored on a separate on-disk file.  SDI features   SDI driver  SDI files can be mounted as virtual disk drives and assigned a drive letter if an SDI driver is available to allow this. A SDI driver is a type of storage driver and is commonly used with Windows XP Embedded.  SDI management  Microsoft provides a tool called the \\"SDI File Manager\\" (sdimgr.exe) which can be used for the purpose of manipulating SDI files. Some of the tasks which this tool facilitates are: * The creation of an SDI image file. * The creation of an SDI image file from an existing hard disk partition. * The verification of an existing SDI image.  SDI loader  The mechanism which allows for the creation, addition and removal of virtual disk drives. SDI Loader and Driver work with Disk BLOB.

After the Mongol army crossed the Yalu river, it quickly captured almost all of Goryeo's border defenses. The Mongol army, however, ran into stiff resistance both at Anju and the city of Kuju (modern-day Kusong), commanded by General Park Seo. To take Kuju, Saritai used a full array of siege weapons to bring down the city's defenses. Lines of catapults launched both boulders and molten metals at the city's walls. The Mongols deployed special assault teams who manned siege towers and scaling ladders. Other tactics used were pushing flaming carts against the city's wooden gates and tunneling under the walls. The most grisly weapon used during the siege were fire-bombs which contained boiled down, liquefied human fat. According to an old Mongol general who, toward the end of the siege said: :\\"...I have never seen [a city] undergo an attack like this which did not, in the end, submit.\\" Despite the fact the Goryeo army was heavily outnumbered and after over thirty days of brutal siege warfare, Goryeo soldiers still refused to surrender and with mounting Mongol casualties, the Mongol army could not take the city and had to withdraw.

At least 1,193 were built between 1938 and 1945. It was the standard light gun of the German mountain divisions, both Army and Waffen-SS, during World War II. Development and description The 7.5 cm GebG 36 was designed by Rheinmetall to meet an Army requirement for a 7.5 cm howitzer to serve in the mountain divisions (Gebirgs Divisionen) and replace the World War I-era mountain guns still in service such as the Austro-Hungarian 7.5 cm Gebirgskanone 15. Production began in 1938 although exactly how many were produced that year is unknown.Gander and Chamberlain, p. 289 Some 1,193 were built between 1939‚Äì45. The design of the 7.5 cm GebG 36 was relatively conventional in regard to the gun itself, with its standard German horizontal sliding breech block and muzzle brake. To maximize its ability to fire at high-angles, it was given rear trunnions to lengthen the distance between the breech and the ground, although springs became necessary to balance the muzzle preponderance. Furthermore, it used the a variable recoil system that shortened the recoil as the elevation increased. The breech was uncommonly massive as it incorporated a transport joint to allow it to be separated from the barrel.Hogg, p. 32 The spades at the end of the split trail legs were removable. Generally it used light-alloy disc wheels with rubber rims, but early guns had wooden-spoked wheels. No shield was fitted to save weight. It could be towed in one load or broken down into eight pack-loads to be carried by mule or horse. It weighed .Hogg, p. 32 Because of its lightness the 7.5 cm GebG 36 would jump when fired at low angles as the recoil forces would force the gun's trail spades to act as a fulcrum and lever the wheels upwards. In fact Charge 5, the largest propellant increment, was forbidden to be fired at angles under 15¬∞ because the gun would jump excessively. Firing at higher angles was perfectly safe as the ground absorbed any residual recoil forces not absorbed by the recoil system.Hogg, p. 32 Ammunition The 7.5 cm GebG 36 fired a wide variety of ammunition, with the notable exception of a conventional armor-piercing shell. It used instead a unique hollow-charge armor-piercing shell that weighed with a maximum range of .Zentner, C. Soldaten im Einsatz. Jahr Verlag Hamburg (1977). p. 115 It had its own high-explosive shell, but could also fire that used by the 7.5 cm FK 18 as well. When the situation demanded, it could fire a colored smoke shell. It used four increments of propellant which were added together to reach the desired range. A fifth charge could be used which replaced all the other charges for targets at the limit of the gun's range.Hogg, pp. 32-3 While this range was respectable for a light gun, the 7.5 cm calibre soon proved too small for the demands of World War II. Organization The guns were organized into batteries of four guns each with two or three batteries per battalion. A mountain artillery regiment (Gebirgs- Artillerie Regiment) would have anywhere from one to three battalions equipped with the 7.5 cm GebG 36. Notes References * Chant, Chris.

Duncan is the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Toronto riding of Etobicoke North and Duncan serves as deputy leader of the government in the House of Commons. Duncan has previously served as minister of science and minister of sport and persons with disabilities. She has published a book about her 1998 expedition to uncover the cause of the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. Education After graduating from Kipling Collegiate Institute in 1985 as an Ontario scholar, Duncan studied geography and anthropology at the University of Toronto. She then entered graduate school at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, and completed a Ph.D. in geography in 1992. Career Duncan was an associate professor of Health Studies at the University of Toronto, where she taught global environmental processes and medical geography. Duncan is the former research director for the AIC Institute of Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School of Management. As well, Duncan served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organization which won the Nobel Prize in 2007. From 1993 to 2000, Duncan taught meteorology, climatology and climate change at the University of Windsor. In 1992, as she became aware of the increasing probability of a global flu crisis, she was led to investigate the cause of the similar 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, saying, \\"I was horrified we didn‚Äôt know what caused Spanish flu, and also knew that if we could find fragments of the virus, we might be able to find a better flu vaccine\\". Though at the time she \\"knew nothing about influenza\\", she began what she called a \\"six-month crash course in virology\\". Eventually, she began searching for possible frozen samples of lung and brain tissue that might contain the virus. Her initial thoughts led her to think of Alaska, as it contains large areas of permafrost, which would leave the viruses intact, but the search proved fruitless. Eventually, after several years of searching, Duncan learned of seven miners who had died from the Spanish flu and were buried in the small town of Longyearbyen, Norway, an area that would contain permafrost. She then began assembling a team of scientists to accompany her. After several more years of preparation, which involved garnering various permissions to perform the exhumations, the ground survey began in 1998. However, the samples were not viable, as the bodies were not in the permafrost, and the expedition ultimately proved a disappointment. In 2003, Duncan wrote a book about her expedition, entitled Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus. Published by the University of Toronto Press, it details Duncan's process and the expedition itself. After the book's publication, Duncan began speaking about pandemics, which led her to begin teaching corporate social responsibility at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. In 2008, Duncan published a second book, Environment and Health: Protecting our Common Future. Duncan is currently an adjunct professor teaching both medical geography at the University of Toronto and global environmental processes at Royal Roads University, and served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organization that won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore. In 2018, the University of Edinburgh awarded her an honorary degree. Federal politics In February 2008, Roy Cullen announced that he would not be running in the next federal election and Duncan was appointed as the next Liberal candidate. She was elected in the 2008 general election and re-elected in the 2011, 2015, and 2019 general elections. On November 4, 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed her to the Cabinet as minister of science. Duncan was tasked with establishing the new position of chief science officer that would serve as a replacement to the national science adviser role eliminated by Stephen Harper in 2008. As well Duncan became minister for sports and persons with disabilities after Kent Hehr resigned from cabinet following sexual misconduct allegations. Duncan with Justin Trudeau and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, India, 2018 As minister of science and sport, Duncan has made ending abuse and harassment in sport her priority since taking over the portfolio in January 2018. She wants to institute a series of initiatives, including establishing new policy for national sports organizations, funding the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada to create an investigation unit, and setting up a toll-free confidential tipline for athletes and witnesses to call if they experience abuse. Duncan's action items include creating a code of conduct with sanctions and finding a way to prevent coaches or officials from freely moving to another province or club after allegations of abuse. Currently this action item is a work in progress. Duncan's priority as minister of science was to \\"unmuzzle our scientists\\". Duncan was able to bring back the long-form census and chief scientific advisor. In 2019, Duncan won her Etobicoke North seat in west Toronto. Duncan reported that the government in 2018 devoted $2.8 billion to renewing Canada's federal science laboratories because they said that they understand the critical role that government researchers play in Canada's science and research community. She was re- elected in the 2019 federal election, following which Duncan was appointed deputy leader of the government in the House of Commons. Controversies Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is a proposed extremely large telescope (ELT) that has become controversial due to its planned location on Mauna Kea, which is considered sacred land according to the native Hawaiians, on the island of Hawaii in the United States.The Government of Canada has made a commitment to spend $243.5 million over a period of 10 years for the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope. The telescope's enclosure was designed by Dynamic Structures Ltd. in British Columbia. In an online petition, a group of Canadian academics have called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau together with Industry Minister Navdeep Bains and Science Minister Kirsty Duncan to divest Canadian funding from the project. The online petition titled \\"A Call to Divest Canada's Research Funding for the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea\\" was posted to Change.org on July 20, 2019.

Comparable engravings have been described, even further east, around Djelfa and in the region of Constantine. Although in the past some archaeologists affirmed that these engravings derived from European Upper Paleolithic art, this theory is today definitively rejected. History Less famous than the rock art at the Tassili n'Ajjer site, the South Oran engravings have however been the subject of study since 1863. The most important works are notably those of Auguste Pomel (from 1893 to 1898), St√©phane Gsell (from 1901 to 1927), Georges-Barth√©lemy M√©d√©ric Flamand (from 1892 to 1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (in 1925), l'Abb√© Henri Breuil (from 1931 to 1957), L. Joleaud (from 1918 to 1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (from 1935 to 1955). In 1955 and 1964 Henri Lhote had visits of several months to the region which allowed him to complete his former researches, to add hundreds of new descriptions and in 1970 to publish Les gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais in the series M√©moires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques pr√©historiques et ethnographiques (CRAPE) directed at Algiers by Mouloud Mammeri.Published:Arts et M√©tiers graphiques, Paris, 210 pages et reproductions photographiques. A notable part of the work was particularly devoted to the engravings of the El-Bayadh region. For Henri Lhote the South Oran region constitutes one of the \\"three great centres of art of the antelope age\\"Henri Lhote, Les gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais, (Arts et M√©tiers graphiques, Paris). with Tassili (\\"Oued Dj√®rat\\") and Fezzan. Date In this work Lhote tells that a hearth found at the \\"Station of M√©andre\\", near to Br√©zina, had been dated to 3900 years B.C., without this figure being capable of \\"being attributed to a definite category of the engravings which ornament the 'walls' of the station.\\" The oldest of these engravings, on the other hand, show many affinities with those of Tassili which he proposes the minimum date of around 5000. There is therefore room, according to him, to \\"adopt it also for the South-Oranian material until better information may be forthcoming.\\" The region of El-Bayadh on WikiMapia.

St√©phane Gsell considered the most ancient engravings showing antelope and elephants to be Neolithic, and he distinguished from them the images of rams, which according to him reflect an Ancient Egyptian ritual, which, like the depictions of horses he attributed to the historical period. The classification proposed by Georges-Barth√©lemy M√©d√©ric Flamand based on a study of techniques and patinas distinguished a first group of naturalistic engravings (buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, rams, donkeys, horses, antelopes), a second, libyco-berber group (engravings of decadent style, little horses, camels, alphabetic characters) and two late groups (Arab inscriptions and modern graffiti). Presumably, the pictures which Pomel, Flamand and others identify as the recently extinct buffalo species Pelorovis antiquus,Ronald M. Nowak: Walker's Mammals of the World. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999 is called \\"hartebeest\\" in the text of this article below. For Hugo Obermaier there exist two sub-groups in the neolithic engravings, the older being of naturalistic style (hartebeest), the more recent of sub-naturalistic style (less elaborated and smaller-scale subjects). The cult of the ram with the sphere was, according to him, native to the populations of North Africa before having been adopted by the Egyptians. Henri Breuil for his part distinguished three stages. In Stage I, contemporary with the end of the Capsian, he places the large hartebeest with ringed horns, the elephants, and the very style- accomplished as well as large human figures (Ksar El Amar). Stage II, which he attributes to the Lower Neolithic, brings together the large ram of Bou Alem, the hartebeest, rhinoceros, elephants and other animals in less accomplished style. The ram, for him, had not yet been domesticated but only tamed, and its cult is rather the origin than the reflex to the Egyptian belief. Stage III includes the figures in decadent style. Raymond Vaufrey, studying the industry of flint implements found at the foot of the engraved rocks, takes the naturalistic figures to the \\"Neolithic of the Capsian tradition\\" deriving from the Neolithic of Egypt, and places them between 4200 and 2000 B.C. The ram, which he considers domesticated, is only a transposition of the Egyptian cult of Ammon and the representations of it cannot be older than 2200 B.C. For Henri Lhote however, there is not any archaeological argument which should cause one to separate the rams, supposed to be later, from the giant hartebeest, elephants or rhinoceros. Being like them of Neolithic age, they cannot derive from the Egyptian ram, and need not on that account be considered as the ancestors of a cult of which the ram of Ammon would constitute a late sequel. Classification of Henri Lhote Henri Lhote distinguished seven series in the mural art of the South Oranian. Kef el Akhal, large Hartebeest 1. Large engravings of monumental naturalistic style, or Large-scale Hartebeest style. Beside the great hartebeest, elephants and rhinoceros, Lhote placed the numerous ostriches and antelopes, boars, lions and panthers. The animals are represented absolutely in profile apart from the hartebeest, in relative profile (the two-eyed formula being frequent). Lhote placed in this ensemble the human images which accompany them (of which the hands and feet have almost always six digits). No human figure with animal head having been found, he observed that \\"the hartebeest ensembles of the Saharan Atlas differ from those of Tassili-n-Ajjer and of Fezzan where these figures are running. The author also thinks that the domestication of the dog was achieved in this period and that the South Oranian presents the most ancient rock testimonies to it. This first stage also includes the \\"mythic animals\\". All these engravings are made by a punctuation of little dots or hollows, more or less connected, and then most often by a polishing apparently helped by a wooden utensil with the addition of wet sand. Some engravings show a beginning of polishing in the endoperigraphic area (head), others a complete polishing. Tazina, animals in the style of the \\"School of Tazina\\" 2. Small engravings in naturalistic style, or small-scale hartebeest stage. The stage would be constituted by the collection of engravings of more reduced size, of which the style has been designated as \\"School of Tazina\\" after the name of one of the sites. These naturalistic images show the same fauna (hartebeest, elephant and rhinoceros) as those of the preceding group but in very conventionalised forms, the legs and tails of the animals being very thinned out, the lines of the horns and the muzzle prolonged in a 'fantastic' way (Flamand), the lengthening of the body, the hind-quarters and the heads having inspired faulty identifications. The style is however not uniform and on certain murals these characteristic deformations co-exist with more realistic depictions. From a technical standpoint the finish of the engravings is regular, no trace surviving of a preliminary dotting-out, and the patina is similar to that of the preceding stage. The human depictions show the same character but the terminal parts of the limbs, hands and feet are generally rounded-off. Koudia Abd El Hak, superimposed engravings. From a chronological viewpoint, a single station (Koudiat Abd El Hak) shows an indisputable over- drawing, a little antelope with attenuated legs being overdrawn by a large elephant, although another would appear to be later than it. This fact obliged Lhote \\"to ask himself if the small-scale school might be earlier than that of the large engravings, or even if the two schools might have been contemporary.\\" This latter hypothesis would have implied the existence \\"of two different gatherings of humans living side by side or, at the least, two artistic schools operating in parallel.\\" In his analysis Lhote shows that beyond the great similarity of the fauna represented and of the presence of the \\"orant-ram\\" association in both stages, the \\"orant-hartebeest\\" association was not indicated in the second, whereas the antelopes there are more numerous and the lions rarer. He adds that \\"the small-scale style extends towards the south Moroccan as far as the Rio de Oro, although the large-scale style remained confined in the south oran area, with certain migrations towards the north-east.\\" The author's opinion therefore leans therefore towards the existence of two groups. Furthermore, the style of the small-scale art, by comparison with the static forms of the large-scale figures, reflects \\"rather an art which has already attained conventional formulae\\", \\"more advanced in the sense of a more evolved creative impulse\\" and therefore later. But in this hypothesis one should be able to rediscover traces of this so distinctive style in the later group of the decadent engravings, even though these seem, to the contrary, to derive from the large-scale school. In his conclusions the author considers that the small-scale engravings, often thought of as later decadent reminiscences, would be as old as those of the large hartebeest and elephants. \\"Whichever solution may prevail\\", concluded Lhote, one should consider that the identity of the fauna in each of the two groups indicates that there could not have been a great lapse of time between them, and that, despite the variation of styles, one can ask oneself if they do not represent two expressions of one and the same art.\\" Gouiret bent Saloul, human figure sexually displayed, with axe and shield 3. Engravings of sub-naturalistic style or decadent hartebeest stage. These are characterized by the mediocrity of their style and technique, reduced to a fairly clumsy dotting and an irregular final polishing. Their patina is clearer than for the two preceding stages, an observation confirmed by the fact that they are often found on the same murals. Their dimensions are more reduced than the first group, but larger than those of the second, with which they have nothing in common. The most common theme is of sexually displayed human figures, in a semi-crouching position, seen frontally, often together with numerous lions and ostriches. The fauna, less varied than in the two first groups, still includes the last representations of hartebeest of which the horns are not always ringed, and images of elephants, cattle and panthers. The association of man-ram disappears, which seems \\"to mark a rupture on the environment of the foregoing stages and shows an evolution of religious beliefs\\", replaced by the man-lion association, hartebeest and elephants no longer holding the place which they had formerly occupied. It is, according to Lhote, \\"the end, very degraded, of that remarkable artistic epoch of the south Oranian. 4. Engravings of the sub-naturalist style of the husbandmen or the bovidian stage. Gouiret bent Saloul. The domestic cow with long or short horns sometimes wearing little spheres dominates this stage, the fauna being composed otherwise of elephants, antelope and ostriches, while images of humans are rare. The engravings are in various different styles, the formula schematic and massive, called \\"quadrangular\\" by H. Breuil, seeming like the most ancient. The main group of these engravings are not found in south Oran but in the valley of the Saoura (Sahara): Lhote supposes \\"a different origin to that of the preceding groups\\", showing \\"secondary infiltrations which have come from the south.\\" For the author, \\"this bovidian civilization has certainly emerged from a Saharan milieu, but it has only made a very superficial appearance in the south Oran,\\" following the tracks from the Hills of Ksour, having perhaps \\"another direct contact with the Sahara in the region of Br√©sina.\\" 5. Engravings of schematic carriages, which ought to occupy a comparable chronological position to that of the carriages of the Sahara. 6. Libyco-Berber engravings. 7. Modern Arabo-Berber engravings. Other views Bou Alem, the largest ram. For F. Cominardi, analysing most recently the superimposition of engravings at \\"Koudiat Abd el Hak\\",F. Cominardi, Chebka Dirhem I nouvelle station rupestre des Monts des Ksour, dans Lybica , Vol XXIV, CRAPE, Algiers, 1976, pp. 167‚Äì168. it seems accepted that the naturalistic large-scale stage and the naturalistic small-scale stage (the most ancient level being constituted of very tiny engravings, the most recent by works of slightly superior execution) were contemporary, at least within a single epoch, \\"the first not being extinguished before the second began.\\" The author leans, \\"on account of the arguments of the more evolved schematic style, towards placing the naturalistic large-scale stage in the first place, and to making the naturalistic small-scale stage begin before the disappearance of the former.\\" R'cheg Dirhem, hartebeest and human.According to F. Cominardi, \\"It would be during the lapse of time while they coexisted, that the engravings of the plaque of Koudiat were made. Were these two so differentiated artistic worlds brought into being by different peoples? It is possible. It could be explained that they dwelt rarely together on the same rocks, and that the school of Tazina should be so individualized geographically.\\" \\"If the small-scale naturalistic stage is, by comparison with the older stage, if not contemporary, at least starting to unfold during that time, one could, provisionally, place it between the 6th and the 4th millennium.\\" Interpretation Henri Lhote identified among the south Oran engravings 41 images of rams or of sheep-like creatures, which is comparatively few in the sum of the representations, \\"especially as this figure includes small scale images and the uncertain ones of the decadent school.\\" Their symbolic attributes (spheroids, manes, collars) remain very variable, in contrast to those of the Egyptian ram of Ammon, which was furnished right from the start with the symbols which it would always keep, one could claim, according to the author, that they had not yet been fixed in a definitive fashion and we find ourselves here looking at a cult which was just beginning to take form.\\" The difference \\"shows, if it were still necessary to show, that the South Oranians had not adopted the cult from Egypt. In 13 cases the engraved rams are associated with human figures. Analyzing their possible relations, the author's conclusion is \\"that the Ram played a religious role of first importance to the south-Oranians, that its association with man, though he may have been in a praying position, should have been armed with an axe, shows that it certainly had the character of a divinity which one would ask things of and which one might, on suitable occasions, sacrifice.\\" This role, he adds, \\"is well attested in the two hartebeest stages of large and small scale, but disappears in the age of the decadent style where nothing of it remains except the mere vestige.\\" The representations of hartebeest, more numerous (73 for the region) and in 13 cases associated with the presence of a human, show despite the absence of the spheroid \\"which may have been the object of rites associating it with men,\\" that it \\"held an eminent place in the beliefs of the ancient populations of the South Oranians. As for the lion, represented with facing head in the old hartebeest stage where it is only a single time associated with a man, but shown in profile in the decadent style where its associations with humans are on the contrary quite frequent, it seems to have replaced hartebeest and rams. One should be able, according to Lhote, \\"to interpret this phenomenon as a radical modification in the behaviour of south Oranians, a real change, unless it represents the arrival of new human populations.\\" For Henri Lhote, \\"the south Oran engravings are certainly among the oldest artistic and cultic manifestations of Africa which we know of, and the beliefs of which they are the reflection may perhaps have helped to influence the later populations of the Nile valley and of black Africa where animism was to undergo so great a development.\\" Who were the artists? Conjectures on the identities of the artists have been many. Lhote tells that some have believed them to belong to the black populations ancestral to the Mandinka and the Hausas. But the Tuareg, the Egyptians and the ancestors of the Berbers have also been invoked. They have also been thought to have been the Cro-Magnons, the husbandmen and farmers of Asiatic origin, the Harratines, the Proto-Libyans and the Bushmen.

The style rapidly gained popularity throughout Japan due to the efforts of Togasaki Kumataro, Okada Junmatsu, Saito Yakuro, and his sons Shintaro and Kannosuke. History The Feudal Era of Japan Fukui Hy≈çemon (1700‚Äì1782) was born in Shimano no Kuni (now Tochigi Prefecture) and learned Shin Shinkage Ichiden Ryu under Nonaka Gonnai received Menkyo Kaiden at a relatively young age. Hy≈çemon, unsatisfied, traveled Japan taking part in shinken shobu (death matches) and honing his skills. He became so reputed that he was listed on Imperial and Tokugawa Bakufu records as one of the best swordsmen of his time. Hyoemon continued to travel through Japan until he encountered a small shrine in the Inazuma Mountains. There he found the Izuna-Gongen Shrine where he meditated and trained in isolation for 50 days. On the 50th night he achieved enlightenment. The resulting enlightenment was organized into a rather large syllabus of techniques later codified as \\"Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´\\". Hy≈çemon thereafter traveled to Edo (present day Tokyo) where he opened a dojo in Yotsuya. There he trained a small number of dedicated students until his retirement. Hy≈çemon then passed the ryu onto his successor Togasaki Kumataro (2nd Generation). His grave can be found in present-day Saitama not too far from his protege's (Togasaki Kumataro). The fourth successor of Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´, Sait≈ç Yakuro Yoshimichi (ÊñéËó§Âº•‰πùÈÉé), established the dojo called Renpeikan (Á∑¥ÂÖµÈ§®) in Edo. Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ reached the pinnacle of its popularity towards the end of the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868). In this politically unstable time, Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ swordsmen participated in both the political and physical battles that came to define the Bakumatsu (1853‚Äì1868). It was not uncommon for Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ swordsmen of different or even the same dojo to engage each other in combat. Politically active members like Katsura Kogoro and Ito Hirobumi later took active leadership roles in the Meiji Government. Today the Kanto ha Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ is one of the remaining branch of Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´. Negishi Shingor≈ç (Ê†πÂ≤∏‰ø°‰∫îÈÉé) was the last headmaster who teaches Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ in the edo period. Shingor≈ç received the licence Menkyo Kaiden in Edo Den from Sait≈ç Shintaro. Shingoro, however felt the loss of idealism and passion that surrounded him during the closing days of the Tokugawa Bakufu. He acknowledged this fact by closing the Renpeikan's doors (officially ending the Edo Line) and opening the Yushinkan (Êúâ‰ø°È§®ÈÅìÂ†¥) Dojo and founding the Kanto Ha. Prior to the fall of the Tokugawa Bakufu there were many Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ branches all over Japan. These branches operated independently of one another and prospered. The Modern Era of Japan (1868‚Äì) The dawn of the Meiji in 1868, however brought many new hardships with it and most of the branches Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ were forced to close their doors due to lack of patronage and the Meiji Sword Ban. Most surviving branches opened their doors again after the Meiji Sword Ban was lifted. Most, however lost the majority (if not all) of their kata as a result. In present-day branches like Choshu Han Den, Hachinohe Han Den, and Sait≈ç Ha only practice a small portion of the Iaijutsu curriculum. Most of these Iaijutsu kata were reconstructed from written descriptions, and so may not be true to the original forms. The style itself survived the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912) completely intact however, largely due to the efforts of Negishi Shingor≈ç (Edo Den 6th Generation/Creator of Kanto ha) who taught swordsmanship to the Tokyo Police Force. Shingor≈ç's successor Nakayama Hakud≈ç continued to preserve Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ throughout the Taisho (1912‚Äì1926) and Showa Periods (1926‚Äì1989) by producing some of the notable swordsmen in modern history. Examples are Nakayama Zendo, Hashimoto Toyo, Kiyoshi Nakakura, Haga Junichi, and Nakashima Gorozo. The Nihon Kobud≈ç Kyokai and Shinkyokai have recognized Kanto ha of Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ as the branch that preserves most of Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ (Kenjutsu, Iaijutsu, and other practices). The current headmaster of this branch is Ogawa Takeshi (10th Generation). Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ as taught by Iaido Sanshinkai  The Sanshinkai organization teaches a style of Iaijustu also called Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´. The style was propagated by Mitsuzuka Takeshi, a student of Nakayama Hakudo's school, from a makimono that described a set of tachiwaza (standing) kata for intermediate students to the Sanshinkai curriculum. It is often taught alongside Mus≈ç Shinden-ry≈´, but outside of Mus≈ç Shinden-ry≈´'s core curriculum. The styles of Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´ practice in the Sanshinkai and that of Japan's extent groups are not directly related, though the noto is similar.

Button & Sons, Waterford NY - Lyman & Merrie Wood Museum of Springfield History - DSC04148 Lysander Button (September 2, 1810 ‚Äì July 29, 1898) was the inventor of many of the early improvements made on hand and steam fire engines. Many of those improvements made their way to the modern fire engines of today. Button was born in North Haven, Connecticut on September 2, 1810 but moved with his parents to Albany by 1825. After John Rogers relocated his machine shop from Albany to a spot on King‚Äôs Canal in Waterford, Saratoga County, New York, Button found a job there as a machinist. Rogers manufactured fire engines and had even submitted two patents in the 1830s (the copies of which have unfortunately been lost). Rogers sold the shop to William Platt and Judge Nicholas Doe, who expanded the product line to include other castings such as iron water wheels. Without the advantages of a formal education, Button became foreman in the shop by 1833 and was named a partner the following year. In 1841, Platt sold his share of the business to Button, who became the sole owner after Judge Doe died. For the next fifteen years the business was known as L. Button & Company, which continued to operate on Kings Canal. Button later moved to a steam-powered building on Third Street in the Village of Waterford.Handbook of Modern Steam Fire Engines, Roper, 1897 Most of his innovations were for the so-called ‚Äúhand- pumper‚Äù fire engines. He possessed remarkable gifts in mechanical engineering, since by 1838 he had developed the first ‚Äúpiano engine‚Äù which delivered water from the front end of the trunk of the device. Another notable improvement was the ‚Äúrunaround‚Äù that returned water to the suction to relieve pressure on the hose. In 1841 he developed the first fire engine water pump, with valves set at an angle of 45 degrees and straight-level waterways from the inlet to the outlet.Standard of the Age, Utter, 2007 Upon coming of age, Lysander‚Äôs eldest son Theodore became involved with the company, and the name was changed to Button & Son. From 1873 to 1891 Theodore submitted some half a dozen patents, including improvements in hose and pipe couplings, feed water regulators, and steam engines. Two patents were assigned to his brother Charles, who seems to have remained affiliated with the fire engine business even after it was sold to other parties. In 1876, the Button Steamer won the Centennial Award at the Philadelphia International Exhibition for its simplicity, strength, and reliability. However, after spending almost half a century manufacturing fire engines, Lysander decided to retire in 1882 and sell the entire works, including the rights to his many patents, to Holroyd & Company of Waterford. Years later, Button fire engines continued to be manufactured by the American Fire Engine Company, which was formed in 1891 by the consolidation of the Button Fire Engine Works, Silsby Manufacturing Company, Ahrens Manufacturing Company, and Clapp & Jones. In 1900, a group of New York investors formed the International Fire Engine Company, which included American Fire Engine, LaFrance Fire Engine Company, and Thomas Manning Jr. & Company. Button and his wife Abigail Ranney had five children: May Josephine, Eliza, Theodore, Julia, and Charles. After retiring, Lysander took a special interest in local schools by serving on the Board of Trustees and advocating for clean water in the school system. He was also prominent in the Presbyterian Church, becoming a ruling elder. He was superintendent of the Sunday school for 25 years and was a teacher there until within one year of his death, which occurred on July 29, 1898.

Edited by Joe Pruett, Negative Burn is noted for its eclectic range of genres, mixture of established comics veterans and new talents, and promotion of creative experimentation. Publication history The first volume of Negative Burn ended with issue 50 in 1997. Revived by Image and Desperado in 2005 with two seasonal specials, Negative Burn returned to a monthly format in 2006. The first eleven issues of the new volume were published by Image; the title is now exclusively published by Desperado. A typical issue of Negative Burn might include a number of stand-alone stories; a new chapter of a longer, serialized piece; recurring features such as Brian Bolland‚Äôs ‚ÄúMr. Mamoulian‚Äù; and a sketchbook section. The sketchbook featured studies, rough drawings, and never-before-seen artwork by a single illustrator. Artists such as Dave Dorman, Michael William Kaluta, David Mazzucchelli, Terry Moore, P. Craig Russell, Greg Ruth, Charles Vess, and even Neil Gaiman have been featured in the sketchbook section. Desperado Publisher Pruett views the new incarnation of Negative Burn is a potential launching pad for new creators: \\"I‚Äôm offering Negative Burn as a way for a new creator to break in with us. If a creator shows promise and potential with his/her short story contributions then I might try to find them work with an already established creator or title in our library of titles, such as Dalibor Talajic and Federico Dallocchio with Deadworld and Will Volley with Antoine Sharp. I believe there needs to be an outlet for new talent . . . and [I] will try to do what I can to help them.\\" Regarding Negative Burn's current sales, Pruett said \\"it has the advantage of being a well-known commodity from its long run in the 90‚Äôs, but even then it suffers from the consistent month-to-month drop in sales that is the rule of thumb in the marketplace. As long as we can break even with Negative Burn I‚Äôll keep it going.\\" The title was scheduled to return for a third time, as a yearly, in 2009 from DesperadoDiamond Comic Distributors 2009 August order form at a Diamond Comic Distributors website.

There are two types of color mixing: additive and subtractive. In both cases, mixing is typically described in terms of three color and three secondary colors (colors made by mixing two of the three primary colors in equal amounts). All primary colors combined make an orange/brown shade. Additive mixing A simulated example of additive color mixing. Additive primaries act as sources of light. The primaries red, green, and blue combine pairwise to produce the additive secondaries cyan, magenta, and yellow. Combining all three primaries (center) produces white. The additive mixing of colors is not commonly taught to children, as it does not correspond to the mixing of physical substances (such as paint) which would correspond to subtractive mixing. Two beams of light that are superimposed mix their colors additively. By convention, the three primary colors in additive mixing are red, green, and blue. In the absence of light of any color, the result is black. If all three primary colors of light are mixed in equal proportions, the result is neutral (gray or white). When the red and green lights mix, the result is yellow. When green and blue lights mix, the result is a cyan. When the blue and red lights mix, the result is magenta. Red-green‚Äìblue additive mixing is used in television and computer monitors, including smartphone displays, to produce a wide range of colors. A screen pixel uses a juxtaposition of these three primary colors. Projection televisions sometimes have three projectors, one for each primary color. Subtractive mixing A simulated example of (idealized) subtractive color mixing. An external source of illumination is assumed, and each primary attenuates (absorbs) some of that light. The standard subtractive primaries cyan, magenta, and yellow combine pairwise to make subtractive secondaries red, green, and blue (which themselves are additive primaries, or in practice somewhat darker and less-saturated versions of typical additive primaries). Combining all three primaries (center) absorbs all the light, resulting in black. For real pigments, the results would be somewhat complicated by opacity and mixing behavior, and in practice adding a fourth pigment such as black may be helpful. The mixing of colored physical substances corresponds to subtractive color mixing, hence it corresponds to our intuition about mixing colors. To explain the mechanism, consider mixing red paint with yellow paint. The red paint is red because when the ambient light strikes it, the composition of the material is such that it absorbs all other colors in the visible spectrum except for red. The red light, not being absorbed, reflects off the paint, and is what we see. This same mechanism describes the color of material objects ‚Äì note that light is not a material object ‚Äì and so applies to the yellow paint as well. Making recourse to the figure above demonstrating additive color mixing, one sees that yellow light is composed of an (additive) mixture of red and green light. When we mix the two paints, the resulting substance has red paint and yellow paint. The yellow paint absorbs all colors except for red and green. However, the red paint will absorb the green reflected by the yellow paint. The red paint can be said to subtract the green from the yellow paint. The resulting paint reflects only red light and so appears red to our eyes. Note however that this description is theoretical and that the mixing of pigments does not correspond to ideal subtractive color mixing because some light from the subtracted color is still being reflected by one component of the original paint. This results in a darker and desaturated color compared to the color that would be achieved with ideal filters. The three primary colors typically used in subtractive color mixing systems are cyan, magenta, and yellow, corresponding to the CMY color model and CMYK color model widely used in color printing. In subtractive mixing of color, the absence of color is white and the presence of all three primary colors makes a neutral dark gray or black. The secondary colors are the same as the primary colors from additive mixing and vice versa. Subtractive mixing is used to create a variety of colors when printing or painting on paper or other white substrates, by combining a small number of ink or paint colors. Red is created by mixing magenta and yellow (removing green and blue). Green is created by mixing cyan and yellow (removing red and blue respectively). Blue is created by mixing cyan and magenta (removing red and green). Black can be approximated by mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow, although real pigments are not ideal and so pure black is nearly impossible to achieve.

Formerly, he was the weekend sports anchor and reporter at WLS-TV in Chicago, the sports anchor for CNN HLN‚Äôs Morning Express with Robin Meade and also an actor. Background Weigel grew up in a journalism household in Evanston, Illinois, the son of the Chicago television sportscaster and newspaper columnist Tim Weigel and former WGN Radio news anchor Kathy Worthington. He is the grandson of Weigel Broadcasting founder and former Lawrence Welk radio announcer John Jacob Weigel. Weigel has two sisters, Jenniffer Weigel, a former Chicago television news anchor and published author, and Teddi, who began high school in 2008. He was married to photographer Tiffany Weigel. They had their first child, son Heathcliff John Weigel, on November 20, 2009. He became engaged to Kathy Browne in August 2018. Weigel is named after Olympian Rafer Johnson. Growing up, Weigel regularly spent time among journalists and media personalities, including columnist Mike Royko, Studs Terkel, Steve Dahl, Gene Siskel and Richard Roeper. His father Tim began his career as a newspaper sportswriter and eventually became a popular Chicago sports and news anchor. He died of cancer at the age of 55 in 2001. Weigel decided to follow in his father's footsteps after his death. Weigel graduated in 1987 from Evanston Township High School, where he performed on stage with the Piven Theatre Workshop's Young People's company, which featured such notables as John Cusack, Joan Cusack and Jeremy Piven. He worked summers as an intern for his father at WLS-TV. Weigel continued his education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating with a degree in theatre in 1992 after finishing his studies in London. Career Acting Weigel's first acting job was with Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre as the title role in \\"Master Harold\\"...and the Boys and worked with others such as The Wisdom Bridge, Bailiwick, and Organic theatres. His first television role was a small part on the locally filmed TV show The Untouchables. In 1993, Weigel was hired for a news magazine show featuring younger journalists and brought out to Hollywood. Shortly thereafter, Weigel was hired as an on-camera host for VH1 where he joined future Headline News colleague A.J. Hammer. In 1995, Weigel returned to Hollywood, landing small speaking roles on ER and Party of Five, and guest starring on JAG, Charmed, and the former Vengeance Unlimited. In 1997, Weigel was hired as a series regular on the NBC sitcom Jenny, starring former fellow Chicagoan Jenny McCarthy. The series lasted only one season. During this year he also played the Dark Jedi Yun in the video game Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II. Soon thereafter, Weigel began his film career in the lead role opposite William Shatner and Eric McCormack in the cult movie Free Enterprise, and then alongside Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen in the Showtime film Rated X. Journalism After his father died in 2001, he began his pursuit of a career in journalism and returned to Chicago. He wrote an essay after his father's death that ran in the Chicago Sun-Times that opened the door for him as a freelance writer covering high school sports. Weigel covered games all over the Chicago area and wrote regular features on local high school athletes. He also hosted a weekly radio show on WCKG called \\"Celebrity Rock.\\" A year later, he and his wife, Tiffany, relocated back to Los Angeles, where he worked as a clerk in the sports department at The Los Angeles Times. He began writing articles for The Times on a freelance basis and a year later was hired full-time as a high school sports staff writer. Television Weigel's first on-camera journalism job came in 2005 as a freelance reporter for KUSI in San Diego for the weekend morning show‚Äîdoing live remotes at events as well as covering breaking news. He continued working nights at The L.A. Times and mornings for the TV station. In February 2006, he was hired by the CBS-owned and operated station KOVR in Sacramento as a general assignment reporter, covering breaking news, politics and national stories like the Lake Tahoe wildfires and wayward whales Delta and Dawn. In February 2008, Weigel joined the cast of the already-successful morning show Morning Express with Robin Meade. Weigel and the CNN sports team extensively covered the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In March 2011, Weigel became the new weekend sports anchor and reporter at WLS Channel 7 in Chicago, a station where his father spent 17 years as an anchor. He replaced Ryan Chiaverini, who became co-host of Channel 7's morning show \\"Windy City Live,\\" a role Weigel himself had been under consideration for. Weigel decided to go back to his \\"news\\" roots and in October 2014 accepted the anchor role for the 6pm and 10pm shows Monday-Friday in St. Louis at the Fox affiliate KTVI, Channel 2. On September 1, 2017, Weigel joined WFLD-TV in Chicago as a weekend evening news anchor and general assignment reporter.https://www.robertfeder.com/2020/01/27/rafer- weigel-fox-32-let-go/https://www.robertfeder.com/2017/08/22/rafer-weigel- joins-fox-32-weekend-news-anchor/ In October 2019, Weigel was suspended after a northwest Indiana court revealed three-way allegations of harassment and revenge porn.https://www.robertfeder.com/2020/01/27/rafer-weigel-fox-32-let- go/ Weigel was never charged with a crime, and that court dismissed the case in January 2020 for lack of evidence, without Weigel ever having been charged.https://www.robertfeder.com/2020/01/20/robservations-will-angry-cubs- fans-turn-off-tv-boost-score/ However, on January 27, 2020, Weigel was fired from WFLD.https://www.robertfeder.com/2020/01/27/rafer-weigel-fox-32-let-go/ References *Broadcasting & Cable 01/31/08 *Sacramento Bee 01/02/2008 * Chicago Sun Times 06/07/2009 *Media and Marketing Mix 03/08/2011 * External links * Profile on CNN.com * Morning Express with Robin Meade * Morning Express Blog with Robin Meade 1969 births CNN people American television journalists American sports announcers University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign alumni American male film actors Living people Evanston Township High School alumni Television sports anchors from Chicago American male journalists ","title":"Rafer Weigel"},{"id":"19110227","text":"Veerappa Gangaiah Siddhartha Hegde (1959 ‚Äì July 2019) was an Indian businessman from Karnataka.

He directed the driver to wait for him at the other end of the bridge giving an impression that he wanted to take a stroll. The driver reported to the police that he did not show up even after an hour; which led to a search of the area for him. The Indian Coast Guard and National Disaster Response Force eventually joined a search. A letter, apparently written by Siddhartha and addressed to his company board, shareholders, and family, surfaced a few hours after he went missing. This letter detailed the unbearable pressure he was subjected to over the years and the harassment he faced under the \\"previous\\" Director General of Income Tax (Investigation) (referred to as DG in the lettter).

It entered service in 1936 becoming the standard grenade launcher of the Polish Army; it was still in use during the German Invasion of Poland in 1939. The wz.30 had a maximum range of 700 meters; this was increased to 800 meters in the wz.36. They both fired the same 46 mm shell, weighing 0.76 kg. About 3,850 of these 46 mm mortars were produced by 1939. Typically 81 such mortars were distributed to each Polish infantry division‚Äîthree per company.  Development history  In the aftermath of World War I and the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920 the Polish Army used a variety of World War I rifle grenade launchers and light mortars, notably the German World War I-vintage light mortar pressed into Polish service under the designation of Granatnik wz. 16 and the French VB rifle grenade designed for the ageing Berthier rifle. While battle-tested, these weapons were neither accurate nor did they offer enough fire support on a modern battlefield. To counter that in 1927 the Central Rifle School of Toru≈Ñ developed a new blunderbuss, or more properly a rifle grenade launcher to be used with the then-standard Kb wz. 98a rifle. This design however proved little better than the already used weapons and in 1929 all further trials were halted. Work on a new weapon was resumed by the Institute of Material Research for Armament () by a team led by Lt. Col. Kick. It was decided to abandon the idea of a rifle grenade altogether and instead design a crossover between a light mortar and a grenade launcher. In April 1931 a prototype of a new mortar was completed. After a series of successful tests, the weapon was accepted by the Polish Army under the designation of granatnik wz. 30 (\\"grenade launcher Mark 1930\\"). An order for 400 pieces was placed in the Perkun company in Warsaw. By July 1932 the first mortars entered service. Meanwhile, the Instytut Techniczny Uzbrojenia (Armament Technical Institute) continued to improve the design and eventually came up with four different projects, initially code-named \\"type A\\", B, C and D. (some sources call them \\"granatnik wz. 30\\", \\"wz. 33\\", \\"wz. 35\\" and \\"wz. 36\\", respectively). The Centre for Ballistic Studies at Zielonka conducted extensive tests of the four new prototypes hand-made by the Warsaw-based Pa≈Ñstwowa Fabryka Karabin√≥w. Eventually the \\"type D\\" was chosen and was accepted by the Polish Army as granatnik wz. 36. The first batch was ordered at the I. Zieleniewski factory in Krak√≥w, at a price of 1032 z≈Çoty apiece. The first batch of 850 was delivered to the armed forces by the end of July 1937. Another batch of 1,500 followed the next year. Overall, some 3850 were delivered to the army (397 of wz. 30 and 3453 of wz. 36 type), which allowed the creation of either a separate light mortar section of three mortars in every infantry company, or arming every infantry platoon with at least one grenade launcher. Full documentation of the wz. 36 mortar and the 46 mm grenades was given free of charge to Yugoslavia in late 1930s, but no licence production followed.  Operation  Unlike ordinary mortars of the era, the firing angle was fixed at 45 degrees and the range was regulated not by raising or lowering the barrel but by limiting the volume of a gas chamber (see also the Type 89 grenade discharger). The unrifled 46 mm barrel was attached to a flat base equipped with a bubble level and stabilised by a folding bipod. On top of the barrel was an exhaust pipe, equipped with a valve and attached to the bottom of the barrel. By turning the valve, soldiers operating the mortar could limit the size of combustion chamber beneath the grenade, setting the muzzle velocity and thus the firing range at between 100 and 800 metres (700 for the wz. 30 version). The mortar was equipped with a frame sight and a muzzle sight, as well as a firing trigger located at the base of the barrel. In comparison to other light mortars of the period such as the German 5 cm Granatwerfer 36 or the Soviet RM-38, the Polish mortar was less accurate and the grenades used had a smaller warhead, however it was lighter and easier to handle and assemble. Also, thanks to the firing mechanism the weapon could be preloaded and fired immediately upon sighting a target. Pre-war tests proved the weapon reliable and durable. During one stress test the weapon was fired 850 times at a high rate of fire without requiring cleaning or cooling. However, due to the complexity of the design, field repairs were significantly more difficult than with conventional mortars.

He was a noted ascetic known for being prone to ecstatic states on a frequent basis; he served as a prior of several convents until he settled in Forl√¨ where he remained until his death. Salomoni's beatification was approved in mid-1526. Life Giacomo Salomoni was born in 1231 in the Republic of Venice to nobles; his mother raised him after his father died though his mother later became a Cistercian nun at which stage his maternal grandmother raised him. He became a Dominican in 1248 and became the prior of houses at several places such as Faenza and San Severino as well as Ravenna. But Forl√¨ was where he settled for the remainder of his life. He gained fame for healing as well as for his prophetic abilities obtained through an ecstatic state. From 1269 he lived at a Dominican convent in Forl√¨ and was called the \\"father of the poor\\". He also earned fame for being the person who received the confession of Carino of Balsamo - the murderer of Peter of Verona - and became his spiritual director. Salomoni suffered from cancer but he was cured some time before his death in 1314. He was serving in the choir when he suffered a sudden heart attack and died. Salomoni's remains were conserved in an urn at Forl√¨ but in 1939 were translated to Venice to the basilica of Santi Giovanni e Paolo in a chapel. Beatification In 1315 a brotherhood was founded to promote veneration for Salomoni. On 26 June 1526 he received formal beatification from Pope Clement VII upon the confirmation of his cult for Forl√¨. But it was not until 1568 that Pope Pius V approved that veneration for Venice; Pope Gregory XV approved his cult for the Dominicans in 1622. A shrine was built to Salomoni at the Saint Catherine of Siena church that the Dominicans manage in Manhattan. The oldest indult which Pope Benedict XIV quotes in this connection is that which Clement VII granted to the Dominicans of the convent of Forl√¨ on 25 January 1526 to celebrate the Mass for the late Salomoni \\"as often during the year as their devotion may move them to do so\\" (Benedict XIV, De canonizatione de SS.).

Beaufort spent her entire career in the Pacific Ocean, based out of Pearl Harbor and then Sasebo, Japan, and provided salvage and rescue services where needed from the Western Pacific to the North Pacific. Construction The fifth ship to be so named by the Navy, Beaufort (ATS-2) was laid down on 19 February 1968 at Lowestoft, England, by Brooke Marine Ltd.; launched on 20 December 1968; sponsored by Mrs. Waldemar F. A. Wendt; delivered to the Navy at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 5 January 1972; and commissioned there on 22 January 1972, Lt. Comdr. Arthur R. Erwin in command. Naval service Beaufort completed outfitting at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 5 April 1972 and moved first to the Naval Operating Base, Norfolk, Virginia, for deperming and thence to Little Creek, Virginia, to load in preparation for the voyage to Pearl Harbor. She made an overnight stop at one of her namesake cities, Beaufort, South Carolina, on 14 and 15 April and a two-day visit to Port Royal, South Carolina, from 15 to 17 April before resuming her voyage to Hawaii. The salvage tug transited the Panama Canal on 24 April and headed up the U.S. West Coast of North America to San Diego, arriving there on 3 May. Five days later, Beaufort put to sea on the last leg of her voyage. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on 15 May and became a unit of Service Squadron (ServRon) 5. The ship remained in port until 5 June at which time she began shakedown training in the Hawaiian Islands operating area. The salvage tug completed shakedown training on 23 June and soon began diver and salvage training. August brought final contract trials; and, in September, she resumed salvage training and capability evaluation. Between 13 October and 15 November, she towed the former Observation Island (AG-154) to San Francisco, and returned to Pearl Harbor. She arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 15 November and began post-shakedown availability. First Western Pacific Ocean deployment That repair period occupied her for the rest of 1972 and ended on 15 March 1973. At that time, she resumed normal operations out of Pearl Harbor. Salvage training kept her busy until 16 May when she got underway for her first deployment to the western Pacific. Beaufort stopped at Midway Island and Guam before arriving in the Philippine Islands at Subic Bay on 8 June. She conducted operations in the vicinity of Subic Bay until the beginning of July. At that time, the salvage tug got underway for Vietnam. Between 8 and 22 July, she served as a support ship for the minesweepers engaged in Operation End Sweep, the removal of mines from Haiphong harbor in North Vietnam. Losing her tows in a storm She returned to Subic Bay late in July for a short period of upkeep. From there, the salvage tug went to Naha, Okinawa, to pick up three pontoon barges for towing to Ream, Cambodia. Beaufort departed Naha on August first and shaped a course for Ream, however Beaufort encountered a storm and all three barges broke their tow lines so Beaufort Gunnersmates sank all three barges so they were not floating around the open ocean. While in Ream Beaufort came under attack from the jungle. Gunnersmates Day, Kelley Reed, and Seabo returned fire with the 50 caliber machine guns. At the time there was a disabled Cambodian ship so the Captain of the Beaufort directed the Captain of the Cambodian ship, and a minor argument ensued the Captain of the Cambodian ship relented resulting in Beaufort towing the disabled Cambodian ship out of harms way. While in Ream she picked up another tow, a Cambodian Landing Craft, Infantry (LCI), for the voyage back to Subic Bay. The salvage tug reached her destination on 19 August. On the 27th, she got underway for Hong Kong where she made a storm-induced, extended port visit. Beaufort departed Hong Kong on 8 September and headed back toward the Philippines. On the approach to Subic Bay, she took The USS Tripoli LPH-10 in tow and brought her into port on the 10th. After the 'Beaufort' reached port, the United States Marines bought the crew of the 'Beaufort' all of the beer they could drink anywhere on the main street of Magsaysay Street in olongapo, Subic Bay. She put to sea again on 25 September to help to refloat the grounded US Army Sgt. Jack J. Pendleton (T-AKV-5) and returned to Subic Bay from that mission on 9 October. The crew of the Pendelton ran-a-ground on the coral shoal off of North Vietnam. The Pendelton was 10 degrees off course during a storm. It was hauling ammunition to South Vietnam. The seas were heavy, with high waves being pushed by high winds. As the storm subsided, the 'Beaufort' hooked its steel cables to the aft section of the 'Pendleton' and attempted to tow her off of the snow white coral reef; there was no moving the ship. A barge was called from South Vietnam to unload the ammunition, and get it to U.S. Forces in South Vietnam, the unloading was completed by the sailors of the 'Pendleton'. While the unloading was being completed, the crew of the 'Beaufort' put its Navy Divers both Scuba and hardhat into the water to recon the bottom hull of the 'Pendleton'. The Beaufort Hull Technician Divers, noticed a crack in the hull; it was a gap between four inches to twelve inches, and compartments were flooded, which added additional weight. The bow of the 'Pendelton' was protruding approximately twenty feet up toward the sky. Additional ships were dispatched to the scene to assist in pulling the ship off the reef. During the same time, China sent a message stating it owned the island and to stop all procedures and depart the island; North Vietnam also stated it owned the coral reef and to make haste out of the area or it would send a warship to engage the Navy ships, both dispatches were taken seriously, however, no county was taking another operational naval vessel. All towing attempts failed, and a typhoon was closing in on the area. The 'Beaufort' made on final attempt. Another ship rammed the starboard side of the Beaufort, nearly crushing a sailor, as the I-Beam of the other ship crushed-in the side of the 'Beaufort'. The ship was hit so hard, the Mast began to shake violently, and the men on the Bridge were on the deck waiting for it to crash. The 'Beaufort' removed all men from the 'Pendelton', and loaded Divers into a Mike Boat, Landing Craft. The Divers took dive equipment, and demolitions to the 'Pendleton', and set charges to the hull. After retreating approximately 1,000 yards, the charges exploded, and the ship was there \\"for the duration\\". It was used as a Radar Beacon for aircraft. The 'Beaufort' Hull Technicians shored its bulkhead with wood and steel, until it could get back to port for major repairs. During repairs, a U.S. Naval Destroyer was docked starboard side to 'Beaufort'. The 'Beaufort' was under shipyard repairs. There was a 'Wood Camel', a floating dock between the ships, for which shipyard workers were painting the hull of the starboard side. The 'Beaufort' was taking on fuel, which had an 'over flow', and dumped into the area between the ships, and surrounded the 'camel' with two men on it; the Destroyer was flying a red Bravo Flag, taking on ammunition. The 'Beaufort' crew were securing from normal operation for the day, and as sailors were taking showers in the Head 'bathroom', the ship yard welders arc and metal slag fell into the fuel laden water. The fuel caught fire. The Fire Alarm sounded, and the 'In Port Scene Leader' Hull Technician who had the duty day, responded to the fire on the Main Deck Starboard Side, he was dressed in his boxer shorts and Boots. He dragged out a fire hose, and began to fight the fire, he called for additional fire teams to direct water toward the men on the 'Camel' and for others to rescue the men. Then he directed his fire team to put water onto the Destroyer three Port side torpedo tube, which had three live torpedoes; the type one would view on a World War II PT Boat, the Fire Scene Leader of the 'Beaufort' was giving orders to a Lieutenant, who refused to listen, so the Fire Scene Leader of Repair Party #3, hosed him to get the Officer away from the torpedoes, as flames were reaching the weapons. The Scene Leader received flash burns on his face, arms, and chest. The men on the Camel were later rescued. Three Fire Teams were on scene that day, and not one man ran from the danger of possible explosions, they stood their post and put the fire out. The Captain was at the fire scene to assist his men. Some of the men of the Fire Teams were Alegra, Allen, Master Chief Belk, Beltzek, Butler, Duke was burned, Kopitar led Team #2, Mecca, Miller, Rogers, Weirsma, Yost, and several others. On the 24th, the salvage tug shaped a course for Sasebo, Japan. She arrived in Sasebo on 29 October and remained there until 4 November. On the latter day, Beaufort took two tank landing ships in tow and began the voyage back to Pearl Harbor. She reentered her home port on 28 November and spent the rest of the year in post-deployment leave and upkeep. North Pacific operations From 1 January to 20 May 1974, Beaufort underwent a restricted availability in the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Following that repair period, she resumed normal operations in the Hawaiian Islands. That employment lasted until 16 August when she stood out of Pearl Harbor in company with USNS Silas Bent (T-AGS-26) bound for Alaskan waters. She operated with Silas Bent until mid-September. On the 18th, the salvage tug parted company with Silas Bent and laid in a course for Bremerton, Washington. She visited Bremerton from 25 September to 10 October and Vancouver, British Columbia, between 10 and 17 October. During the remainder of October, she made calls at Seattle, Washington; Astoria, Oregon; Longview, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and San Francisco, California. On 4 November, Beaufort departed San Francisco to return to Pearl Harbor. She reentered her home port on 10 November and remained there through the end of 1974. Return to the Far East A restricted availability occupied her during most of January 1975. She resumed operations out of Pearl Harbor on the 27th. Type training, diving drills, and local tows kept her busy until 30 June when she entered the Dillingham Shipyard for a pre-deployment restricted availability. Beaufort resumed local operations on 23 August, and they lasted until 8 September when she got underway for the Far East. The salvage tug stopped at Guam from 15 to 19 September and then continued on to the Philippines. She arrived in Subic Bay on the 24th and operated out of that port until 18 November when she set a course for Japan. Between 24 November and 4 December, Beaufort salvaged some amphibious equipment that had been blown to sea by a storm near Numazu, Japan. On 5 December, she put into Sasebo, Japan, for two days of upkeep. She returned to sea on the 7th, bound for Chinhae, Korea, where she spent the period between 9 and 19 December supporting Republic of Korea Navy salvage training operations. On 20 December, she returned to Sasebo and remained there through the end of the year. Beaufort departed Sasebo on 3 January 1976 and shaped a course for Taiwan. After visits to Keelung and Tsoying, Taiwan, she conducted five days of salvage training with the Taiwanese Navy before heading back to Subic Bay on the 17th. She operated out of Subic Bay until 14 February when she departed the Philippines for Guam towing . The salvage tug brought her charge into Apra Harbor on 22 February and, two days later, got underway with in tow and headed for Midway Island. Beaufort dropped her tow off at Midway on 6 March and continued her voyage back to Pearl Harbor. The ship arrived at Oahu on 9 March and began a month of post-deployment leave and upkeep. She underwent a restricted availability for the installation of firefighting equipment and new navigational lights during the latter part of April and most of May. She resumed operations out of Pearl Harbor on 27 May. Concluding those operations on 16 August, she reentered the Dillingham Shipyard for a regular overhaul. The yard work took about a year, occupying the remainder of 1976 and the first eight months of 1977. During the final three months of the overhaul, however, Beaufort put to sea occasionally for tests and evaluations. After 24 May, additional repairs were made at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. She resumed normal operations in September, conducting refresher training in the local operating area between the 6th and the 25th. Normal operations‚Äîsalvage training and diving drills‚Äîoccupied her time until the end of the first week in November. Re-deployment to the Western Pacific On the 7th, Beaufort stood out of Pearl Harbor on her way to the western Pacific. She arrived at Apra Harbor, Guam, on 18 November. For the next two weeks, she conducted special operations in the Mariana Islands operating area. On 2 December, she broke off the special operations to evade a typhoon at Buckner Bay, Okinawa. On 7 December, she resumed the special operations which lasted until the 14th. The following day, the salvage tug reentered Apra Harbor. She departed Guam on the 22d bound for Korea. She reached Pusan on the 26th but departed again the next day for Chinhae. Beaufort provided support services for from 28 to 31 December and then headed back to Pusan. Following a visit to that port on 1 and 2 January 1978, the salvage tug weighed anchor for Japan. She arrived at Sasebo on 4 January once again and began a 15-day upkeep period. On 20 January, Beaufort put to sea for Korea once again. She stopped at Chinhae from the 21st to the 23d, then headed for Numazu, Japan, where she conducted salvage operations between 26 January and 9 February. After a stop at Yokosuka on 10 and 11 February, she towed the former to sea for a sinking exercise. She completed that mission on the 17th and laid in a course for Hong Kong. At the end of a four-day call at the British colony, the salvage tug headed for Taiwan where she took part in salvage exercises with elements of the Taiwanese Navy early in March. Salvaging a downed F-14 She returned to Hong Kong on 9 March for an 11-day visit before getting underway for Subic Bay. On her way there, however, she received orders diverting her to the Gulf of Thailand to salvage a downed F-14. From 25 to 31 March, conducted recovery operations on the fighter. On 1 April, Beaufort put into Singapore for a week of liberty and upkeep. She returned to sea on the 9th, bound for surveillance duties in the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands. That mission continued until 23 April when the ship entered Apra Harbor, Guam, for a two-day port call. On 26 April, she began her voyage home to Oahu. She reached Pearl Harbor on 5 May and began a month of post-deployment leave and upkeep. On 5 June, Beaufort resumed normal operations with a visit to Lahaina Roads near the island of Maui. There, she conducted a bow-lift exercise on the former Bluegill. Similar duty elsewhere in the Hawaiian Islands and the mid-Pacific operating area occupied her for the rest of the year and into 1979. Return to the Western Pacific At the end of January 1979, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability. Beaufort completed repairs on 11 March and resumed local operations. On 1 April, the salvage tug began preparations for overseas movement and, on the 24th, departed Pearl Harbor for the western Pacific. The ship arrived in Apra Harbor, Guam, on 5 May and operated from that port until the 27th when she got underway for the Philippine Islands. Beaufort stopped at Legaspi between 1 and 4 June before arriving in Subic Bay on the 6th. For the next four months, she performed the usual U.S. 7th Fleet duty visiting a number of ports, towing ships, and conducting salvage training. On 29 September, she departed Yokosuka, Japan, to return to Hawaii. Beaufort arrived in Pearl Harbor on 10 October and, after post-deployment standdown, resumed local operations on 13 November. Duty out of Pearl Harbor occupied her time through the next nine months. On 25 August 1980, she got underway for the west coast of the United States. The ship reached Oakland, California, on 1 September and remained there until the 7th. Beaufort headed back to Hawaii on 8 September and arrived there on 15 September. Five days later, she got underway for the western Pacific. The salvage tug arrived in Apra Harbor, Guam, on 6 November. Following a nine-day stopover at Guam, Beaufort weighed anchor for the Philippines. En route, she conducted a surveillance mission in the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands. On 26 November, the salvage tug arrived in Subic Bay but remained only until the 30th when she embarked upon a voyage which took her to Thailand and Singapore. Beaufort returned to Subic Bay on 2 January 1981. She operated out of that port until 6 April when she got underway for home. The ship stopped at Guam on 12 April but continued her voyage east on the 13th. Beaufort reentered Pearl Harbor on 28 April and remained there until 8 June when she resumed operations in the Hawaiian Islands. Decommissioning Beaufort was decommissioned on 8 March 1996 and was struck from the Navy List on 12 December 1996. She was disposed of through the Security Assistance Program, transfer and cash sale of the hull and transferred to the Republic of Korea Navy on 29 August 1996.

Produced by Paramount Cartoon Studios (formerly Famous Studios) and directed by Isadore Sparber, it was released in 1957 and is the final cartoon in the Popeye series of theatrical cartoons released by Paramount Pictures. Plot The cartoon opens with Popeye and Olive Oyl out at sea on a life raft playing checkers. Popeye suddenly spies an old sailing ship on the horizon, which also thrills Olive who cannot wait to go home and watch television again. Popeye then twirls his pipe around and, using it like an outboard motor, propels the raft towards the ship. The raft hits the ship and breaks apart, catapulting Popeye and Olive aboard. The camera then pulls over to the ship's figurehead, which also reveals the ship is called \\"Sea Witch,\\" which has been adrift at sea since 1678. Unbeknownst to the couple, as they search the ship for the crew, the ship does have a crew, but of ghosts with English accents (voiced by Mercer). Upon hearing voices outside their quarters, the ghosts wake up and spot the boarders. Despite concluding that the ship is deserted, Popeye determines that the ship is still seaworthy enough to return to land. Having heard this, the ghosts become alarmed at the thought of returning to human civilization, as they like the peace and quiet of being adrift at sea and don't like civilization. The captain of the ghost crew agrees that they must get rid of the boarders in order to keep their peaceful life at sea intact. Soon afterwards, as Popeye starts to sail the ship in the direction towards land, two ghosts appear behind Olive (resting in the anchor rope) and toss the anchor overboard (to stop the ship in place), which unravels the rope and sends Olive flying and spinning. Olive then flies towards Popeye and, with her spinning legs, knocks him through the ship's wheel, much to the amusement of the ghosts. Olive manages to pull the wheel off Popeye, but only succeeds in getting stuck in the wheel herself, generating more laughter from the ghosts. Later, while Olive repairs the wheel, Popeye starts pulling up the anchor, which gets the ship moving again, but one ghost paints grease on the last few yards of the rope and another ghost tangles some of the anchor rope around Popeye's leg. As soon as the anchor is almost aboard, the greased part of the rope slips through Popeye's hands and the anchor stops the ship again and pulls Popeye overboard into the water. While Popeye struggles underwater trying to free himself from the rope, Olive tries to pull the anchor back up, but isn't strong enough. The ghosts (now invisible) take the opportunity to blindfold Olive and force her to the plank. Back underwater, Popeye manages to grab a swordfish and use its snout to cut the rope, allowing him to swim back to the surface and back on to the ship, which has now started moving again. At this point, the ghosts (still invisible and holding a sword) force Olive to walk the length of the plank while Olive cries out for Popeye. The sword disappears just as Popeye sees Olive almost about to walk off the edge of the plank. He picks it up and redirects it so that Olive ends up landing face first into a bucket of water. Olive cries out that she's drowning, but Popeye reassures her she's all right and goes to steer the ship. Just as soon as Olive spits out some water, she suddenly feels herself being carried along the deck. The moment Olive begins to state her suspicions about the ship, two ghosts (carrying her) appear, holding her by her arms. Olive then freaks out and manages to escape the ghosts' grip, running past Popeye while screaming \\"Ghosts!,\\" and immediately dives overboard, but Popeye catches her just in time and pulls her back aboard. Popeye tries to assure her that ghosts aren't real, but a ghost cuts loose a sail above them and the sail falls onto Popeye. Seeing Popeye covered by the sail, Olive shrieks (thinking Popeye is a ghost), grabs a quartermaster's baton, and starts clubbing Popeye with it, but Popeye's shouts make her stop right away and realize her mistake. Seeing that all their haunting isn't working against the boarders, the ghosts run towards Popeye and Olive while wielding swords and shouting out what they intend to do with them. Olive flees to another part of the ship while Popeye runs into the ship's galley. While inside, he sees a jar of \\"ye king's spinach\\" and runs back out to face the attacking ghosts. Popeye immediately consumes the spinach and becomes invisible. The ghosts all stop at the spot where Popeye had been and wonder where he's gone. Popeye then appears in ghost form and punches all the ghosts so hard that they become solid. The now solid ghosts then crash into a wall, which kills them and allows Olive to take the ghosts and sew them together into a new sail. With the ship now ghost free, Popeye and Olive sail off into the sunset back for civilization and sing Popeye's song as the short ends - and the cartoon series with it.Internet Archive Availability Because the cartoon is in the public domain in the United States, it is available on various VHS and DVD compilations of theatrical Popeye cartoons as well as streaming video from various web sites. This is also the last Famous Studios cartoon to be in the public domain.

LA 73 was built as a bypass to the backbends of River Road. It was soon after bypassed itself in a more complete way with U.S. Route 61 (Airline Highway). Route description From LA 75 (River Road), LA 73 travels north north east as an undivided two-lane road through the Dutchtown area before hitting I-10 and US 61. From US 61 it turns north through Prairieville, Louisiana and turns northwest to cross Bayou Manchac. At one time, this portion of the highway was called Hope Villa Road. For most of its length in East Baton Rouge Parish, LA 73 is known as Jefferson Highway. At Tiger Bend Road it becomes a four-lane with turning lane for about a mile and before becoming concurrent with Airline Highway for another mile. After leaving Airline Highway it takes a generally northwesterly path until it becomes Government Street at the entrance to downtown Baton Rouge. As Government Street it proceeds due west to a junction with River Road. LA 73 ends at an intersection with the southbound beginning of LA 30, also known as St. Philip Street. History The route of LA 73 was originally called \\"Clay Cut Road,\\" as it roughly followed the Claycut Bayou through the southern part of East Baton Rouge Parish. Other names for the road were Hope Villa Road, as it traversed through the community of Hope Villa in Ascension Parish. When the Jefferson Highway auto trail was designated in 1916, Clay Cut and Hope Villa Roads became part of the new road (there is now another Claycut Road in Baton Rouge, located south of the present-day LA-73). When Louisiana numbered their highways in 1921 plan, Jefferson Highway was designated Louisiana Highway 1. US 61 followed the section between Prairieville and the Mississippi River from 1926 until 1933 when the Airline Highway was opened between Prairieville and the Bonnet Carr√© Spillway. US 61 remained on the section between Prairieville and Baton Rouge until 1941, when Airline Highway was extended into Baton Rouge. As of 2018, the portion west of LA 948 is under agreement to be removed from the state highway system and transferred to local control.

These engines were the earliest members of the Wright Whirlwind engine family. Design and development The R-790 Whirlwind began as the Lawrance J-1, a nine-cylinder air-cooled radial developed in 1921 by the Lawrance Aero Engine Company for the U.S. Navy. The Navy was very enthusiastic about air-cooled engines, which it felt were better suited for naval use than liquid-cooled ones.Wright J-5 \\"Whirlwind\\" (PDF), by Kimble D. McCutcheon, from the Aircraft Engine Historical Society Lawrance was a small company, though, and the Navy doubted it could produce enough engines for its needs. Despite urgings from the Navy, the major U.S. aircraft engine makers, Wright and Curtiss, were satisfied with their liquid-cooled engines and showed no interest in building air-cooled ones. Since the Navy was already a major purchaser of Wright engines, it decided to force the issue by suggesting that Wright purchase Lawrance and build the J-1 itself, while informing the company that the Navy would not buy any more of its existing engines or spare parts. To keep the Navy's business, Wright was thus compelled to buy Lawrance in 1923, and the Lawrance J-1 became the Wright J-1. By the time Lawrance merged with Wright, it had already developed the J-2, a more powerful version of the J-1 with slightly enlarged bore and displacement. However, Lawrance decided the J-1 was large enough, and the J-2 never went into production; only two examples were built. Over the next two years, Wright gradually refined the J-1 engine, introducing the J-3, J-4, J-4A, and J-4B. The changes improved the engine's reliability, cooling, and fuel consumption, but the basic design, dimensions, and performance were unaltered. The J-4 was the first engine to bear the Whirlwind name; previous engines had no name, only a designation. The J-5 Whirlwind, introduced in 1925, was a complete redesign of the engine which greatly improved its cooling and breathing, further increasing its reliability and reducing its fuel consumption. Among the more visible changes were a much wider separation between the valves, for better cooling airflow, and completely enclosed pushrods and rocker arms, rather than exposed ones as on the earlier engines. The U.S. government later designated the J-5 Whirlwind as the R-790, but it did not apply this designation to the older engines.Naval Aviation Chronology 1920‚Äì1929, from the Naval Historical Center. See entries for 1928, February 1 and 28. All these engines had a bore of 4.5 in (11.4 cm), a stroke of 5.5 in (14.0 cm), and a displacement of 788 in3 (12.91 L). In a 1928 report on transcontinental aviation, the author noted that a typical five-seat commercial aircraft cost $12,500 of which $5,000 was for one of the 350 200 hp Whirlwind Engines available that year. The J-5 was the last of the original nine-cylinder Whirlwinds. In 1928, it was replaced by the seven-cylinder version of the Whirlwind J-6. Image:Wright_J-6.jpgPartially sectioned Wright J-4B at Canada Aviation Museum Image:Wright_R790_2.jpgSide view of the USAF museum's R-790 (J-5) Operational history Many Whirlwind engines were used in U.S. Navy aircraft, mostly in trainers, but also in some ship-based observation and fighter aircraft. As the engines were refined and their reputation for reliability grew, their use expanded to U.S. Army trainers and a wide range of U.S. civil aircraft, including the earliest versions of the Fokker Trimotor and Ford Trimotor airliners. The reliability of J-5 Whirlwind engines also led aviators to use them for a number of record-setting distance and endurance flights. The most famous of these is Charles Lindbergh's solo transatlantic flight from New York City to Paris on May 20‚Äì21, 1927, in the Spirit of St. Louis, powered by a single Whirlwind J-5C. During Lindbergh's flight, the engine ran continuously for 33.5 hours. Lindbergh's achievement greatly boosted the Whirlwind's already good reputation. Some other historic long- duration flights made in aircraft powered by the J-5 Whirlwind: * Clarence Chamberlin and Bert Acosta made a record endurance flight of 51 hours, 11 minutes, 25 seconds in a single-engined Wright-Bellanca WB-2 over New York City in April 1927. * Chamberlin and Charles Levine flew nonstop from New York City to Eisleben, Germany, in the same Wright-Bellanca on June 4‚Äì6, 1927, in a flight lasting 42.5 hours (3,920 mi). * The first successful flight from the continental U.S. to Hawaii was made by Albert Hegenberger and Lester Maitland in the Fokker C-2 Bird of Paradise from Oakland, California, to Honolulu, Hawaii, on June 28‚Äì29, 1927, lasting 25 hours 50 minutes (2,400 mi). * The first flight across the Pacific was made by Sir Charles Kingsford Smith in the Fokker Trimotor Southern Cross from Oakland to Brisbane, Australia, with stops in Hawaii and Fiji, from May 31 to June 9, 1928. The leg from Hawaii to Fiji lasted 34.5 hours over 3,100 mi (5,000 km) of open ocean. * A record endurance flight of 150 hours, 40 minutes, and 14 seconds was made by U.S. Army fliers in the Fokker C-2A Question Mark trimotor over Southern California on January 1‚Äì7, 1929. Achieved with the help of aerial refueling, this flight ended only when valvetrain failures stopped the portside engine, and excessive valvetrain wear was slowing the nose and starboard-side radials. Charles L. Lawrance, who developed the original Whirlwind series and became president of Wright, won the 1927 Collier Trophy for his work on air-cooled radial aircraft engines. Licence-built versions The J-5 Whirlwind was built by Hispano-Suiza in France. The Whirlwind J-5 was also produced under license in Poland by several makers. Among these were Polskie Zak≈Çady Skody, the Polish branch of ≈†koda Works, which built about 350 to 400 engines from 1929 to 1931, and the Polish firm Avia, which manufactured a further 300 engines from 1935 to 1938. Polish- built J-5s were used in numerous Polish aircraft, mostly in military training, observation, and liaison aircraft.

Couney, also known as the ‚ÄòIncubator Doctor‚Äô, was best known in medical circles and public view for his amusement park sideshow, ‚ÄúThe Infantorium‚Äù, in which visitors paid 25 cents to view prematurely-born babies displayed in incubators. After allegedly apprenticing under Dr Pierre-Constant Budin, an established French obstetrician in the 1890s, Couney began exhibiting incubators at expositions and fairgrounds around In Europe, and then America (Mars, 2019). Couney is best-known for his Infantorium at Coney Island, New York. During Couney‚Äôs active years at fairgrounds across America, it was widely believed that premature babies were ‚Äòweaklings‚Äô, who were unfit to survive into adulthood. Couney was one of the first advocates for premature babies, and his Infantoriums have become widely accredited with saving the lives of over 6,500 premature babies. Couney is additionally recognised as one of the first pioneers of neonatological technology.  Early Life  Martin Couney was born Michael Cohen (or Cohn) in Krotoszyn, Poland in 1869. Raffel, D., 2019. The Strange Case Of Dr. Couney: How A Mysterious European Showman Saved Thousands Of American Babies. 1st ed. Blue Rider Press. Couney‚Äôs cultural and professional background remain contested as Couney repeatedly changed the details about his personal background throughout his life. The ambiguity of his early life has long impacted his work and reputation. The mystery Couney enforced on his background was compounded by his lack of an official medical licence. Barry, R., 2018. Coney Island‚Äôs Incubator Babies. [online] JSTOR Daily. Available at: [Accessed 17 March 2020]. Couney stated he had studied in Leipzig and Berlin and that his medical licence was European, and therefore, that his doctorate was not applicable in America.Silverman, W., 1979. Incubator-Baby Side Shows. American Academy of Pediatrics, (2), pp.127-141.Mars, R., 2019. The Infantorium. [podcast] 99% Invisible. Available at: [Accessed 17 March 2020]. However, there is no record of Couney ever studying medicine in any European institutions. Prentice, C., 2016. The Man Who Ran A Carnival Attraction That Saved Thousands Of Premature Babies Wasn‚ÄôT A Doctor At All. [online] Smithsonianmag.com. Available at: [Accessed 16 March 2020]. There is some evidence to suggest that Couney immigrated to the United States in 1888 when he was 19 years old, however this sheds suspicion on his claims of having completed both a medical degree and of having studied under Dr Budin due to the inconsistencies in this timeline. In 1903, Couney married Annabelle Maye, a nurse employed in one of his ‚ÄòInfantoriums‚Äô. BBC News. 2016. How One Man Saved A Generation Of Premature Babies. [online] Available at: [Accessed 18 March 2020]. In 1907, Couney‚Äôs daughter, Hildegarde Couney, was born six weeks premature, weighing just three pounds (1.4 kilos).  Apprenticeship and Early Career  Despite the many unknowns of Couney‚Äôs life, it is widely accepted that he was an apprentice under Dr Pierre-Constant Budin in Paris, an established obstetrician, known as the founder of modern perinatal medicine. In 1896, Couney entered his first exhibition as Budin‚Äôs intermediary to exhibit Budin‚Äôs Kinderbrutanstalt, or ‚Äòchild hatchery‚Äô, to spectators at Berlin‚Äôs Great Industrial Exposition. Snow, R., 1981. Martin Couney. American Heritage, (32). The exhibit was a success and in 1897, Couney was invited by exposition promoter Samuel Schenkein to host an exhibit at the Diamond Jubilee Celebration for Queen Victoria in London to present his first infant incubator show. Following the European success of Couney‚Äôs displays and a move to the United States, Couney held the American debut of his incubator show at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha. Couney then began showcasing his Incubator shows in fairgrounds across the US, including the World‚Äôs Fair in Buffalo, New York in 1901.  Incubator Evolution  Artificial incubator for premature babies designed by R. Mathieu. Note the sides of glass and the inclusion of thermometer and sponges in the model. Originally, incubators were used by poultry farmers to hatch chicken eggs, with the original design being little more than a heated, enclosed box. St√©phane Tarnier, a prominent French obstetrician in the nineteenth century, has been widely recognised as the first to implement incubators in the care of human infants. At the time, his ideas were deemed unscientific. It wasn‚Äôt until his assistant Dr Pierre-Constant Budin exhibited the incubators at Berlin‚Äôs World Fair that the incubators gained considerable attention. Couney‚Äôs alleged apprenticeship under Dr Budin allowed him the knowledge and ability to promote and spread the medical importance of these machines. The importance of the infant incubators was noted early on in Couney‚Äôs career by medical journal The Lancet during the Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The Lancet editors visiting the infant exhibit noted that while the use of the incubators had ‚Äúnot yet become general in England‚Äù, they further claimed that ‚Äúany successful attempt to improve the construction of incubators and to render this life-saving apparatus available to the general public must be welcomed.‚Äù Each Incubator at Couney‚Äôs Infantorium measured around 1.5m high, with steel walls, framework and a glass front. In order to fill the incubators with warm air, water boilers fed warm water into pipes that ran underneath where the babies rested and thermostats were placed inside the incubators to maintain and regulate temperatures. Couney was also concerned with the entrance of impurities into the air of the incubators. In order to filter out impurities in the air, the air fed into the pipes was first filtered through wool suspended in antiseptic, then again through dry wool. The air was then cycled out of the incubators, constantly refreshing the infant‚Äôs air.  The 'Infantorium'  Nurse bathing an infant in the Baby Incubator exhibit Couney‚Äôs shows varied in name from fairground to fairground, including the ‚ÄòInfantorium‚Äô and ‚ÄòBaby Incubators‚Äô. Couney‚Äôs slogan was ‚ÄòAll the world loves a baby‚Äô and he encouraged nurses to take the babies out and cuddle them in front of audiences. The babies were placed in incubators with glass doors to allow visitors to see in and contained warm, filtered air. At the Coney Island ‚ÄòInfantorium‚Äô, Couney worked in tandem with established doctor, Dr Julius Hess and he employed a team of nurses who lived onsite, taking care of the premature infants at all hours. Dr Couney is usually remembered for his Coney Island facility, but he also established a similar exhibit in Atlantic city which ran for 38 years, from 1905 to 1943. Couney‚Äôs facilities were known for their professionalism and cleanliness. Couney was influenced by one of his employed nurses, and later wife, Annabelle Maye who insisted upon the importance of strict hygiene and systematic procedure. In 1903, the average cost for the care of one infant at Couney‚Äôs facility was $15 ($405 today). The care costs of premature babies was expensive, however, Couney did not charge the parents of his patients for their care. Couney made up the costs of caring for the infants through the entrance fees during the exhibitions. The entrance fees covered not only the care of the infants, but also allowed Couney to pay his nurses a good wage and facilitated the frequent travel of the exhibit.  Infant Care  Upon being admitted to Couney‚Äôs care, infants would all undergo the same routine. The infants were first bathed in lukewarm water and, if they were capable, were given a small dose of brandy. Ribbons, either pink or blue, were tied around the babies and allowed visitors to identify the sex of the infants. The infants would be on show throughout the day in individual incubators, excluding two hours for feeding. The ‚Äòpreemies‚Äô were fed breastmilk in three different ways, depending on the varying abilities of the infants to receive milk. Most were fed by either wet nurses or using bottles. However, some infants were administered breastmilk spooned through the nose by Madame Recht, one of Couney‚Äôs long-time employees. Couney placed strict diet restrictions on his nurses. While under his employment, nurses were not allowed to smoke, consume foods, such as hamburgers, or drink alcohol as Couney believed doing so would impact the quality of the nurses‚Äô breastmilk. Couney also encouraged his nurses to take the babies out of the incubators and cuddle them in front of audiences. In addition to holding the infants, one of Couney‚Äôs long-time wet nurses at Coney Island, Madame Recht, would show a diamond ring to audiences before sliding it up the babies‚Äô arms to emphasis the tiny size of the infants. These performances however triggered outcry from child protection groups, claiming Couney objectified the infants for monetary gain. Leinhard, J., 2006. Babies In Sideshows. [podcast] Engines of our Enginuity. Available at: [Accessed 22 April 2020]. Indeed, in 1897 as Couney was starting his career in the field of neonatology, an anonymous source in the medical journal The Lancet condemned the exposition as ‚Äúan unscrupulous way to make money‚Äù. Couney defended his sideshow, claiming his exhibits were the last resort for many ‚Äòpreemies‚Äô, and that his survival rate was much higher in fact than many hospitals. In 1934, in order to demonstrate the importance and success rates of the incubators, Couney hosted a reunion at the Chicago World Fair for the babies that he and Dr Hess had cared for in 1933. On July 25, 1934, 41 of the 58 babies, accompanied by their mothers, returned to Coney Island for a ‚ÄòHomecoming‚Äô ceremony.  Reputation  Couney‚Äôs reputation suffered after the 1911 Coney Island Fire. Despite all of the infants being rescued, the incident highlighted the dangers of caring for infants in amusement parks. Coney Island History Project. n.d. Coney Island Hall Of Fame: Dr. Martin Couney. [online] Available at: [Accessed 23 April 2020]. Others decried the entire notion of infant incubators in fairgrounds. In the medical journal The Lancet in 1897, an article titled ‚ÄúThe Danger of Making a Public Show of Incubators for Babies\\" lamented the proximity of infant incubators to animal exhibits and peep shows, concerned that the unsanitary conditions of the animal exhibits would endanger the babies. It was also seen as inappropriate to house the infants so close to 'scandalous' peep shows, especially as the Infantorium shows attracted many families and children. The perceived dangers of ‚Äòpreemie‚Äô fairground exhibits were accentuated by imposter shows, which began appearing in fairgrounds as a result of the profitability of shows such as Couney‚Äôs Infantorium. These shows often did not adhere to the same cleanliness and professional standards as the well-known Infantorium. As a result, medical journals at the time condemned the shows as risky and dangerous for the premature infants. The support of Dr Julian Hess, who came to be known as the father of American neonatology, during the 1933 Chicago World Fair improved Couney‚Äôs reputation. The exhibit ran for two consecutive summers, over 18 months from 1933-1934. The facility cost $75,000 ($1.4 million today) to construct and was fronted by a huge sign bearing the words, ‚ÄúLiving Babies in Incubators‚Äù. By the end of the second summer, Chicago‚Äôs health commissioner had become involved in Couney‚Äôs efforts. It was not long after the end of the fair that Chicago became the first American city to officially implement policies for the explicit purpose of premature infant care. Throughout Couney‚Äôs career, whenever a midway or fairground closed, Couney attempted to donate his incubators to local hospitals, his donations were never accepted. By the year of Couney‚Äôs death in 1950, incubators had been integrated into public hospitals. Couney is now recognised as a pioneer of early infant care. His exhibits worked against the claims of the then popular eugenics movement and helped introduce the issue of premature births to the general populace. Due to the high fatality rates of prematurely-born infants in the first half of the twentieth century, the topic was generally undiscussed. Couney‚Äôs promotion of his Infantorium demonstrated that ‚Äòpreemie‚Äô infant care could be successful, if expensive.  Eugenics Movement  The eugenics movement of the early twentieth century presented an ideological contrast to Couney‚Äôs treatment of premature babies. The eugenics movement was reaching its peak at the beginning of the 20th century and Couney‚Äôs ‚ÄòInfantoriums‚Äô were often showcased in the same fairgrounds as exhibitions supporting the eugenics movement. Articles in medical journals at the time condemned Couney‚Äôs treatment of premature babies, stating the babies would pass on their ‚Äúdeficiencies, deformities and vices‚Äù to the next generation. A film produced by an American doctor in the early 1900s was even tagged ‚ÄúKill Defectives, Save the Nation‚Äù and articles in medical journals questioned efforts to save premature infants, doubting the efficacy of such efforts. The prominence of the eugenics movement led many doctors at the time to perceive Couney as farcical, and premature babies often left to die without medical intervention.

Early life Sears, n√©e Sarah Carlisle Choate, was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts on 5 May 1858, the daughter of Charles Francis and Elizabeth Carlisle Choate. Her family was one of the Boston Brahmins, a very prominent class of cultural society in New England. In 1876 she studied painting at the Cowles Art School in Boston and later attended courses at the Museum of Fine Arts a few blocks away. In 1877 she married real estate magnate Joshua Montgomery Sears (1854‚Äì1905), one of the wealthiest men in Boston. The combination of her own family‚Äôs wealth and that of her new husband meant that she would live a life of leisure, free to pursue whatever interested her.

She continued her art studies and won prizes for her watercolors at the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1893), the Universal Exposition in Paris (1900), the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo (1901) and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in Saint Louis (1904). Photography and later life \\"Mary\\", by Sarah C. Sears. Photogravure published in Camera Work, No 18, 1907 About 1890 she began exploring photography, and soon she was participating in local salons. She joined the Boston Camera Club in 1892, and her beautiful portraits and still lifes attracted the attention of fellow Boston photographer F. Holland Day. Soon her work was gaining international attention. At the same time she was pursuing her photography interest, she and her husband were hosting some of the most elegant cultural and artistic parties in Boston. They often featured private symphonic performances and included many international composers and performers, including Ignacy Paderewski, Serge Koussevitsky and Dame Nellie Melba. In 1899 she was given a one-woman show at the Boston Camera Club, and in 1900 she had several prints in Frances Benjamin Johnson‚Äôs famous exhibition in Paris. In early 1900 she met American Impressionist Mary Cassatt, and the two continued to be friends for the remainder of their lives. During this same period she was elected as a member of the prestigious photographic associations: the Linked Ring in London and Alfred Stieglitz‚Äôs Photo-Secession in New York. In 1904 she stopped working to care for her ailing husband, and after his death a year later she devoted herself to managing the family‚Äôs finances for a brief period. She then traveled throughout Europe with Cassatt and Gertrude Stein, collecting more art and living a highly glamorous lifestyle among artists, musicians and writers. Added by the advice of Cassatt, she began to collect early Impressionist paintings by Edgar Degas, Edouard Manet and others. Her collection included Manet‚Äôs well-known ‚Äò‚ÄôStreet Singer‚Äô‚Äô, later donated by her to the Museum of Fine Arts. Under the guidance of Stieglitz, she also collected modernist paintings by Maurice Prendergast, Arthur B. Davies, Paul C√©zanne, Georges Braque and Henri Matisse. She took a particular interest in Prendergast, arranging for his first Boston exhibition and later paying for him to study in Europe. In 1907, two of her photographs were published in Camera Work, but by that time she had lost much of her interest in photography. She continued to paint watercolors for the rest of her life but rarely photographed again. She died in West Gouldsboro, Maine, on 25 September 1935.

The presence of all four variables indicates a 40‚Äì60% positive predictive value for a culture of the throat to test positive for Group A streptococcus bacteria. The absence of all four variables indicates a negative predictive value of greater than 80%. The high negative predictive value suggests that the Centor criteria can be more effectively used for ruling out strep throat than for diagnosing strep throat. The Centor criteria were originally developed for adults. A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2013 looked at whether it could be applied to children aged 2‚Äì16. It was a retrospective study (2008‚Äì2010) and looked at 441 children who attended a Belgian hospital emergency department and had a throat swab taken.

Background  Li Lin was born in 694, during the reign of Wu Zetian. He was a member of the imperial Li clan of Tang Dynasty -- although he was distant in lineage from the imperial lineage itself. His great-great- great-grandfather Li Qidou (Êùé‰πûË±Ü) was a younger brother of Li Hu (ÊùéËôé), the grandfather of Tang's founding emperor Emperor Gaozu, who was the grandfather of Wu Zetian's husband Emperor Gaozong.New Book of Tang, vol. 70. Li Lin's father Li Jun (ÊùéÊø¨) served successively as the prefect of three different prefecture and was known for his honesty. Li Jun died during the Kaiyuan era (713-741) of Emperor Gaozong's and Wu Zetian's grandson Emperor Xuanzong while serving as the military governor (jiedushi) of Jiannan Circuit (ÂäçÂçó, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan).  Before serving as chancellor  Li Lin himself was well-studied and capable in literary matters. On the account of his father's official service, he was able to enter civil service and eventually served as a census officer for the capital municipality, Jingzhao (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), which included the capital Chang'an. In 734, Emperor Xuanzong made an attempt to find imperial clan members with special talents, and Li Lin, one of the imperial clan members selected, was made Dianzhong Shiyushi (ÊÆø‰∏≠‰æçÂæ°Âè≤) -- a low-level imperial censor -- and he subsequently served as a junior officer at the ministries of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hu Bu) and civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Li Bu). In 742, he became Jianyi Daifu (Ë´´Ë≠∞Â§ßÂ§´), one of the officials in charge of submitting proposals of corrections to the emperor. In 746, he served a tour of duty to survey the circuits to the west -- Hexi (Ê≤≥Ë•ø, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu), Longyou (Èö¥Âè≥, headquartered in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai), and Anxi (ÂÆâË•ø, headquartered in modern Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang) - to evaluate the performance of the officials. His tour was considered a success, and he was made an imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong). In 748, he became Bingbu Shilang (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé) - an assistant minister of defense -- serving with Yang Guozhong. At that time, though, Yang was already very powerful due to his personal association with Emperor Xuanzong, as cousin to Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine Consort Yang Yuhuan, and Yang Guozhong did not wish to share authority with Li Lin, and therefore had the chancellors, while allowing Li Lin to keep the title of assistant minister of defense, be made in charge of the imperial examinations instead. Soon, however, Yang Guozhong was moved to another position, and Li Lin resumed his office as assistant minister of defense. In 752, he was given the honorific title of Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (ÈäÄÈùíÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´) and made the principal of the imperial university (ÂúãÂ≠êÁ•≠ÈÖí, Guozi Jijiu). In 755, while he retained those titles, he was made the governor of Hedong Commandery (Ê≤≥Êù±, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) and the surveyor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù± as well, but referred to the entire circuit, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). He was said to have governed simply and honestly, and was praised by both the people and subordinates. In winter 755, however, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang Circuit (ËåÉÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Beijing). As Li Lin was a civilian official not learned in military matters, the imperial government was concerned that he would not know how to defend the commandery. Li Lin was therefore recalled to Chang'an and replaced with the general L√º Chongbi (ÂëÇÂ¥áË≥Å). Li Lin was also created the Baron of Weiyuan. In summer 756, when Emperor Xuanzong was forced to flee Chang'an in light of An's troops approaching Chang'an, Li Lin escaped Chang'an as well and caught up with Emperor Xuanzong's train, attending Emperor Xuanzong on his way to Chengdu. Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, however, did not follow Emperor Xuanzong to Chengdu, but instead went to Lingwu, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong), a declaration that Emperor Xuanzong recognized after the news reached him. Emperor Xuanzong, now using the title Taishang Huang (retired emperor), however, did not stop exercising imperial authority, and when he arrived at Chengdu, he initially made Li Lin deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang) and Shangshu Zuo Cheng (Â∞öÊõ∏Â∑¶‰∏û), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). He soon made Li Lin the minister of justice (ÊÜ≤ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xianbu Shangshu).  As chancellor and death  In spring 757, Emperor Xuanzong gave Li Lin the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. At that time, Emperor Xuanzong had already sent several other chancellors that he had commissioned during his journey to Chengdu and during the duration he was at Chengdu -- Wei Jiansu, Fang Guan, Cui Huan, and Cui Yuan -- to Emperor Suzong's court, but kept Li Lin with him on account of the fact that Li Lin was an imperial clan member. Li Lin oversaw all of the affairs of Emperor Xuanzong's court in Chengdu. In winter 757, after Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an and welcomed Emperor Xuanzong back to Chang'an, for Li Lin's accomplishments, he was given the honorific title Jinzi Guanglu Daifu (ÈáëÁ¥´ÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´). He continued to be the minister of justice, now under the title Xingbu Shangshu (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏). His chancellor de facto designation was promoted to Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), a more honorific designation, and he was created the Duke of Bao. At that time, the most powerful figures at Emperor Suzong's court were his wife Empress Zhang and the eunuch Li Fuguo. Li Lin's chancellor colleagues Miao Jinqing and Cui Yuan both carefully followed Empress Zhang's and Li Fuguo's wishes, but Li Lin refused to do so. This displeased Li Fuguo and, in 758, at his instigation, Li Lin was removed from his chancellor office and made Taizi Shaofu (Â§™Â≠êÂ∞ëÂÇÖ), an advisor to the crown prince Li Chu.Old Book of Tang, vol. 112 . He died in fall 759 and was buried with honors.

He has also played for Worksop Town, Gainsborough Trinity and Matlock Town. Career Cropper was a produce of the youth setup at Sheffield Wednesday and signed professional terms with The Owls in August 2000, a few months prior to the club's relegation from the Premier League. He would make the first and reserve teams and although offered a new deal he left the club on a free transfer in the summer of 2002. During the 2001‚Äì02 season Cropper signed on loan for Worksop Town, He notched up a decent scoring rate for them, netting ten goals in twenty games. On 10 May 2002, Cropper along with Ben Futcher became Lincoln City manager Keith Alexander's first signings of his second spell in charge at Sincil Bank. He made his Football league debut in the club's 1‚Äì1 opening day draw at Kidderminster Harriers on 10 August 2002, though this was marred when, seven minutes from time, referee Phil Crossley deemed his challenge on Abdou Sall unfair and, following an earlier booking for dissent, dismissed him for two bookings. His home debut, three days later, was a far happier affair as he notched his first goal for the club in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Rochdale. Cropper had a good season with Lincoln, but failed to score as many goals as his play deserved in a season which saw him and his team lose out in the playoff finals at the Millennium Stadium. The following season, Cropper found himself overlooked, and was finding himself on the bench on a regular basis due to long lay offs with injury and the performances of the club's other forwards. In February 2004 he signed on loan with Non-League club Gainsborough Trinity, in a month that saw him net once in five appearances at The Northolme. He returned to Lincoln after his month and was subject to another loan offer, this time from Scarborough, but he rejected the chance to play for Scarborough in favour of a permanent switch to local rivals Boston United. Cropper played five times for Boston and scored once but suffered a serious knee injury towards the end of the season which prompted his release from the club. Upon returning to the game Cropper turned down a move to King's Lynn before re- joining former club Worksop Town. He made a move to Matlock Town in September 2005 for an undisclosed fee.

He remains famous for hunting down large numbers of grizzly, cougars and black bears. A mix between a transcendentalist spirit and an ardent Christian, he is described as an unfathomable Southern wild character. He was a stern practitioner of simple living and outdoor freedom, roamed and hunted from Louisiana to Arizona and from Idaho to as far south as Chihuahua and Durango, Mexico, and was a subject of American folktales. He guided on hunting expeditions oiler W. H. McFadden and President Theodore Roosevelt, whom he intrigued and who wrote about him. He was arguably the most prolific hunter of apex predators in the history of North American hunting and also the last active mountain man of the historical American Southwest.The Ben Lilly Legend, by J. Frank Dobie He was not a conservationist but made important contributions of fauna specimens and naturalistic observations to American institutions and museums. He was a contradictory character and his exploits have been consistently exaggerated to folktale proportions, and most records are oral, bona-fide, Americana transcripts. Personal life Lilly was born in the winter of 1856 in Wilcox County, Alabama of parents from North Carolina. His family moved from Alabama to Kemper County, Mississippi when he was young and he spent most of his childhood there, being raised as a devout Christian. After the end of the American Civil War, at twelve, he was sent by his parents to a military academy in Jackson, Mississippi, but ran away. His whereabouts were not known to his family for a long time, until his uncle, Vernon Lilly, by chance discovered him running a blacksmith shop in Memphis, TN. His uncle, a \\"planter\\" from Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, offered Lilly a job, and he accepted. After his uncle's death, he inherited the cotton farm, and there, in 1880, he married his first wife, Lelia, whom he not so affectionately referred to as \\"daughter of Sodom and Gomorrah\\". He also worked as a blacksmith but did not pursue this career for long; later he used these skills to fashion his hunting knives and traps. There, in Louisiana, he discovered his passion for big-game hunting after killing a black bear with a knife, and started relentlessly pursuing hunting as a career for the rest of his life. At first, he was making an income selling bear meat and wild honey. Then he moved to east Texas, in the Big Thicket and lived for three years around 1904‚Äì1907 in the hunting camp of Ben Hook, with whom he partnered. In 1907, he guided President Theodore Roosevelt, as chief huntsman in a big game hunting expedition in Tensas Bayou, Louisiana. Roosevelt wrote about Ben Lilly: > I never met any other man so indifferent to fatigue and hardship. The > morning he joined us in camp, he had come on foot through the thick woods, > followed by his two dogs, and had neither eaten nor drunk for twenty-four > hours; for he did not like to drink the swamp water. It had rained hard > throughout the night and he had no shelter, no rubber coat, nothing but the > clothes he was wearing and the ground was too wet for him to lie on, so he > perched in a crooked tree in the beating rain, much as if he had been a wild > turkey. He equaled Cooper's Deerslayer in woodcraft, in hardihood, in > simplicity‚Äìand also in loquacity. Lilly was 5'9\\" tall and around 180 lbs, and known for the strength and stamina that stayed with him until old age, \\"spare, full bearded, with mild, gentle eyes and a frame of steel and whipcord.\\"Theodore Roosevelt In his convictions, Ben Lilly did not smoke nor drink alcohol or coffee, facts that set him apart from the rest of his contemporaries. He was, however, fond of eating bear and particularly cougar meat, which, he believed, in a similar fashion to syncretic Native American ideas, would give him feline powers. He was one of the most accomplished houndsmen at the time in North America, and was strict but fond of his packs of hounds, mostly Southern catahoula and coonhound breeds. In 1908, he crossed into Mexico, to Chihuahua, and then took to the Sierra Madre mountains, in western Coahuila, where he hunted grizzly and became the source of local tales, notably the one of him pursuing a menacing large grizzly that sported a white star and terrorized locals of Camino Real. A description of a grizzly hunt while in Coahuila, Mexico, narrated personally by him remains: > Old man Sanborn set me on him. They was grizzlies, four of them, and I > tracked them down by myself and killed them. They was desert bears, light > colored with a stripe down their back, but desert or mountain they didn't > get away and I killed the four of them, brought their skins back to Sanborn. He crossed back into US and settled in Gila Wilderness, New Mexico, and starting in 1911 was employed by the government and local cattle ranchers for killing predators, earning the most money in his lifetime. He is credited with killing the last wild grizzly in the vast Gila Wilderness. In 1912 he was registered as hunter and trapper for the Apache National Forest in Arizona, living near Clifton and earning $75 a month. Between 1916 and 1920 he was employed full-time by the U.S. Biological Survey. The ties with the agency started in 1904, when at 50 years old, he began sending specimens of the animals he hunted and trapped to the collections of U.S. Biological Survey, today's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Museum of Natural History, Washington D.C., through the care of his friend, Ned Hollister. Those specimens included mountain lions, brown and black bears, deer, otter, and rare animals like the Mexican gray wolf or ivory-billed woodpecker. The most famous of these specimens went to the Smithsonian Institution, and was a record grizzly hunted in northeast Arizona. On occasion, he captured mountain lion cubs and raised them to full maturity, not as pets, but to observe their habits. In 1921, Ben acted as guide for Oklahoma oil tycoon W. H. McFadden on his memorable hunt through the Rocky Mountains, from Mexico to Canada. For some reason, Lilly left the party in Idaho and did not finish the trip to Canada. For fifteen years, from 1911 to 1926 between Ben's fifty-fifth and seventieth years, he reached his goal of hunting every day of the year, except Sundays. By hunting all bears and cougars, Benjamin Vernon Lilly held the personal belief that he was in a sacred mission for the extermination of \\"malefic creatures\\" and spared no effort in doing so. He was no doubt, one of the most destructive individuals contributing to the reduction of North American apex predators to the brink of extinction, an act contrary to modern standards of both ethical hunting and wildlife conservation. The numbers of animals killed by Ben Lilly in his exploits are disputed, but it is estimated that he killed between 600 and 1000 mountain lions in his lifetime. An epitaph that Ben Lilly wrote on the box in which he buried one of his most prized hounds in 1925, near Sapillo Creek, New Mexico, read: > Here lies Crook, a bear and lion dog that helped kill 210 bear and 426 lion > since 1914 (n.n. 11 years period), owned by B. V. Lilly ... He was known many times to fight and dispatch in hand-to-hand combat bear and cougars using a self-made custom Bowie knife, more precisely a double edged S-shaped large Arkansas toothpick dagger, named \\"The Lilly Knife\\". For the rest he was an accomplished marksman and used Winchester lever-action rifles, a .30-30 for cougars and a .33 Winchester (.33 WCF) caliber for bears. He died at eighty, on December 17, 1936, on a ranch in Pleasanton, near Silver City, New Mexico and is buried in the historic Memory Lane Cemetery in Silver City. History of Memory Lane Cemetery, Silver City, NM His modest tombstone bears the epitaph: \\"Lover of the Great Outdoors\\". In 1947 the last people who knew him erected a bronze plaque to his memory, on Bear Creek, Pinos Altos, New Mexico. Peculiarities, humor and quotes In one well known account, his wife sent him to shoot a chicken-hawk that was bothering the birds around their home. Then he went missing for almost two years, and upon his return, when asked what happened, he gave the laconic answer: \\"That hawk just kept flying!\\" Quotes from Benjamin Vernon Lilly are sometimes shocking by today's standards, many completed with Southern humor: > Anyone can kill a deer but it takes a man to kill a varmint. by varmints he meant bears, mountain lions, and wolves. > Property is a handicap to man. > I never saw a man with his face shaved clean until I was a big boy. When I > saw him I thought he was a dead man ... walking about, and I was mighty > scared. Ben Lily to a rogue bear, prior to dispatching him with a Bowie knife: > You are condemned, you black devil, I kill you in the name of the law! Another time, he said: > My reputation is bigger than I am. It is like my shadow when I stand in > front of the sun in late evening. Gallery Bibliography  Books * The Ben Lilly Legend, by J.

Fauna The island is home to thousands of little penguins. As well as the black-faced cormorants, recorded breeding seabirds and waders include the little penguin, short-tailed shearwater, common diving-petrel, white-faced storm-petrel, Pacific gull, silver gull, sooty oystercatcher and crested tern. Cape Barren geese also breed there, European rabbits have been introduced and the southern grass skink is present. The island is approximately long and wide, lying from the north-eastern coast of Tasmania. It is partly privately owned and has been badly affected in the past by grazing, frequent fires and, in July 1995, by the oil spill which killed between 2000 and 6000 little penguins. The island forms part of the Ninth and Little Waterhouse Islands Important Bird Area (IBA), so identified by BirdLife International because it holds over 1% of the world population of black-faced cormorants. Ownership and conservation In approx 1988‚Äì1989, Ninth Island was purchased for 64,000. In February 2015, Ninth Island was advertised for sale with an asking price of A$500,000; however in July it was passed in at auction for 1.19 million. The island currently does not have a jetty or an airstrip, so the only way to access the island is via helicopter. In 2012 the Ninth Island Conservation Area was formed on the island. This conservation area completely surrounds the central hill on the island and extends all the way to the shoreline. In addition, the full tidal region of the island's shoreline has been designated Tidal Crown Land, managed by the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service.http://maps.thelist.tas.gov.au/listmap/app/list/map A conservation covenant exists on the island, owing to the fact a mutton-bird rookery exists on the island. Region Other islands in the Waterhouse Group include St Helens, Tenth, Waterhouse, Little Waterhouse, Maclean, Baynes, Foster, Swan, Little Swan, Cygnet and Paddys islands and Bird Rock and George Rocks islets.

He spent most of his professional career in Spain, almost exclusively in the lower leagues with Celta de Vigo B. Football career Early years / Celta Born in Novi Sad, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Mariƒá moved to Spain in his teens, going on to play for three different clubs as a youth, including FC Barcelona and RC Celta de Vigo. He made his senior debut with the latter's reserves and scored regularly for the Segunda Divisi√≥n B side, notably netting 21 goals in 32 games in the 2007‚Äì08 season (best in his group, second overall); however, he only appeared once for the main squad in Segunda Divisi√≥n, his output consisting of 30 minutes in a 1‚Äì2 home loss against CD Castell√≥n on 2 February 2008. In 2008‚Äì09, Mariƒá was loaned to another team in the third level, FC Barcelona B. In June 2009, he was released by the Galicians. Norwich City Mariƒá joined Norwich City on trial in the summer of 2009, touring with the club during its pre-season in Scotland and scoring twice in three matches, against Airdrie United and St Johnstone. Afterwards, manager Bryan Gunn confirmed he had been impressed well enough to offer the player a contract, with the one-year deal being signed on 30 July. Mariƒá made his official debut for the Canaries against Yeovil Town, for the campaign's Football League Cup, appearing as a substitute. His first start came in the 2009‚Äì10 Football League Trophy against Brentford (1‚Äì0 win) but he was almost always fifth-choice during his spell, behind the habitual Grant Holt and Chris Martin but also Jamie Cureton and Cody McDonald; subsequently, he left the side after his link was terminated by mutual consent, on 3 December 2009. Return to Spain / Hungary For the second part of 2009‚Äì10, Mariƒá returned to Spain and its division two, signing with Real Uni√≥n. He appeared rarely during the season (less than one half of the league matches), also suffering team relegation. Mariƒá spent the better part of the following years in Hungary, in representation of Lombard-P√°pa TFC. Personal life Mariƒá's father, Zoran, was also a footballer and a striker.

Bates (born 1963) is a professor of individual differences in psychology at the University of Edinburgh. His current research interests include the genetics of reading and spelling, intelligence, and personality.  Biography  He is currently a member of the editorial board of the journal Intelligence. His PhD was completed in 1994 at the University of Auckland (New Zealand) and integrated the Eysenckian dimensional model of psychosis with the categorical model of schizotypy proposed by Paul E. Meehl, using measures of personality, creativity, evoked potentials, and smooth pursuit eye movement dysfunction. He has since conducted research in individual differences, genetics, and cognitive neuropsychology, publishing nearly 100 peer-reviewed scientific journal articles. His principal academic achievements include demonstrating the existence of two separate forms of dyslexia, underpinned by distinct genes, and, subsequently, demonstrating that the genes associated with dyslexia are also linked to normal variation in reading ability. This work evolved into searches for specific genes involved in reading and language. In positive psychology, he showed (along with Alexander Weiss and Michelle Luciano) that the genes for happiness are genes for personality, suggesting that a general factor of genetic well-being and specific genetic influences from the five factor model traits of Extraversion, Neuroticism/Stability, and Conscientiousness completely explain the heritable component of differences in happiness. With Caroline Rae, Bates showed that creatine supports cognitive function ‚Äì finding that creatine supplements in vegans substantially increased their cognitive ability and working memory by comparison with placebo. This supported a literal 'mental energy' model of intelligence, first postulated by Charles Spearman. In his work with the late Hans Eysenck and subsequently with Con Stough on the role of basic information processing speed in human intelligence, he used ERP complexity measures to argue for a modification to the Hendrickson and Hendrickson error or \\"string theory\\" (so named as pins and string were used to make the measurements of EEG output) model of ability, to include a controlling role of attention. In related work on reaction time, he introduced a novel modification to the Jensen box, again controlling the role of attention in this task, and suggesting that under these conditions, intelligence is, as Arthur Jensen proposed, related to the rate of information processing defined in Fitts Law and using Claude Shannon's information metrics. At the University of Edinburgh he has investigated individual differences in intelligence, memory, and the genetic and environmental influences on social behaviours, such as coalition affiliation, politics, and altruism. Working with Ian Deary, Paul Irwing, and Geoff Derr, he reported evidence for substantial gender differences in intelligence in the form of much larger variance amongst males than amongst females, with more boys and men scoring in both the extreme high range, and in the extreme low range.

The festivities included song and dance, usually performed or led by masked professionals. The carnival song was elaborated under the rule of Duke Lorenzo the Magnificent (1469-92) and the ducal court became more involved. Lorenzo wrote lyric poems designed to be sung by members of his court and of the city's guilds, whose members also sang their own songs, with lyrics drawn mostly from popular legend and daily life. These canti are the textual descendants of the caccia, a song form that was typically satiric and obscene, revelling in the double entendre. The musical settings were generally chordal and strophic (often ABBC), similar to the frottola, which was then popular in Mantua. The A and B stanzas were typically in common metre, the final stanza was then in perfect (i.e. 3/4) time. Performance outdoors and before popular audiences probably constrained the music to be simple and unsubtle. These songs were usually serenades, chariot songs, and processionals, often song from parade floats. Though we know that Heinrich Isaac composed canti carnascialeschi for Lorenzo around 1480, none of these works survive. One anonymous surviving song, Orsu car' Signori, is an advertisement paid for by the guild of scribes: \\"Step up, dear sirs, if you wish your bulls quickly certified.\\" The fate of many of the canti was sealed by the fall of the Medici and the Bonfire of the Vanities (and the like) under Girolamo Savonarola. Some melodies escaped destruction by being set to new (sacred) words. The canti, with the carnivals, were restored after Savonarola's downfall in 1498, but they were increasing ceremonial in character and the exercise of writing songs for them became more literary.

The resort covers of mountainous terrain. During the winter cat-skiing operation, the land is used primarily by guests of the lodge, who access the lodge by snowcat. Members of the public use the cross-country trail system in the Cedar Valley, and some back-country touring groups access the high alpine terrain by traversing over from Fernie Alpine Resort. In summer, the access road is open to the lodge. Geography Island Lake Lodge is surrounded by the Canadian Rockies in the southern portion of the Kootenay Range in Cedar Valley, to the west of the City of Fernie. Unique weather patterns tend to bring much more precipitation to the area than usually found this far inland, creating benign conditions for powder skiing. History Island Lake's of land The Island Lake property has been under private ownership since the early 1900s. In 1907, the North America Land and Lumber Company purchased the mill and timber rights to the area now known as the Island Lake Resort from the Cedar Valley Company. The mill was located at the junction of the existing access road (Mount Fernie Park Road) and Highway 3. Logging was restricted to the distance foresters were able to drag the logs to the mill and only the lower portion of the resort access road shows signs of high grade logging. Eventually, the land was sold to Shell Oil Company. Island Lake Mountain Tours began as a small back- country ski touring operation on the property in 1986, leasing the land from Shell. In 1988, one of the founders purchased a Pisten Bulley snowcat and catskiing at Island Lake was introduced. Initially, accommodation, meals and leisure space were provided in the small Bear Lodge building. In 1994, Island Lake Mountain Tours purchased the land from Shell, becoming the only cat- skiing operation in British Columbia to own the land they operated on. In 1996, the accommodation capacity was increased with the construction of the Red Eagle Lodge. More upscale accommodation was added in the Cedar Lodge in 2002. Construction of the Tamarack Lodge, which now functions as the hub of the resort including a full serviced restaurant, spa facilities and eight luxury suites, commenced in 2004. In April 2005, the property was purchased by the owners of Mica Heli Guides in Mica Creek, British Columbia who continue to operate the Resort.

The Kalaripayattu not only trained in battle but also developed a range of healing modalities known as Kalari Chikitsa, which comprises various massage techniques; Chavutti Thirumal, Marma Massage (Uzhichil), and the application of medicinal herbal oils.  Overview  Unlike most massage modalities, Chavutti Thirumal is unique as the feet are used to deliver the treatment. This act is an art form, with the technique being precisely executed by the practitioner's foot in long, sweeping therapeutic motions from the fingers to the toes of the recipient. The main focus of Chavutti Thirumal is to increase flexibility, so the position of the recipient's body on the floor with the therapist holding onto a rope for support, is paramount. Correctly positioned, the massage enables the postural muscles to strengthen, the hips and thoracic area to open, and the energetic channels (nadi) to become activated. An Ida and Pingala approach is evident in Kalaripayattu, with Kalari Chikitsa being entwined within the training regime where it is used to prepare and heal the body in the two distinct training and healing seasons.

Morley, ed., The Plays and Poems of William Heminge, Madison, NJ, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2006. He was the ninth child and third son of John Heminges, the actor and colleague of William Shakespeare. William Heminges was christened on 3 October 1602 in the parish of St. Mary's, Aldermanbury, in London. He was educated at Winchester School and then at Christ Church, Oxford, where he attained his M.A. degree in 1628. Only two of his plays have survived, The Jews' Tragedy (1626; published 1662) and The Fatal Contract (c. 1639; published 1653). In these two tragedies, the dramatist was strongly influenced by the works of Shakespeare. A third play is lost: titled The Coursing of the Hare, or the Madcap, it was staged at the Fortune Theatre in March 1633. Little is known of Heminges's life. The parish records of St. Giles in the Fields record the birth of a daughter in 1639, and the burials of two sons a decade later.G. E. Bentley, \\"Players in the Parish of St. Giles in the Fields,\\" Review of English Studies, Vol. 6 No. 22 (April 1930), pp. 149-66; see p. 159. He was in financial difficulties in the middle 1630s, and spent some time in prison. His date of death is a mystery; Andrew Pennycuicke and Anthony Turner, the booksellers who issued The Fatal Contract in 1653, refer to him then as deceased. The \\"Elegy\\" Among Heminges's non-dramatic literary works, his satirical \\"Elegy on Randolph's Finger\\" (c. 1632) has gathered significant attention from scholars and critics. Its fullest version occurs in MS. Ashmole 38 in the collection of the Bodleian Library at Oxford.John J. Parry, \\"A Seventeenth Century Gallery of Poets,\\" Journal of English and Germanic Philology, Vol. 19 (1920), pp. 270-7. The poem refers to an incident in which Thomas Randolph lost his finger \\"in a fray\\" with \\"a riotous gentleman.\\" (Heminges and Randolph were friends and former schoolmates.) In the poem, the severed finger is carried into the Underworld by group of English poets that includes Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Michael Drayton, Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton, George Chapman, Thomas Heywood, James Shirley, John Ford, John Webster, and Richard Brome, among others ‚Äî the \\"neoterical refined wits\\" of the age. Charon, however, refuses to ferry the group across the river Styx, because they can't pay his fee. (John Taylor the Water Poet tries to talk Charon into giving them a free ride...but unsuccessfully.) Eventually the poets obtain some of Mercury's quicksilver, and use that to pay the fare. Across the river, Randolph's finger is welcomed by Edmund Spenser, Geoffrey Chaucer, Rabelais, Plautus, Terence, and other worthies. An excerpt from the longer poem, in slightly different form, is known by the title \\"On the Time Poets.\\" It was first published anonymously in the 1656 collection Choice Drollery, Songs, and Sonnets. As John Heminges' last surviving son, William Heminges inherited his father's shares in the Globe Theatre and the Blackfriars Theatre at John Heminges's death in 1630. Together with Cuthbert Burbage, Richard Robinson and Winifred (d.1642), his wife, Joseph Taylor and John Lowin, William Heminges filed a Bill of Complaint on 28 January 1632 in the Court of Requests against the owner of the Globe, Sir Matthew Brend, in order to obtain confirmation of an extension of the 31-year lease originally granted by Sir Matthew Brend's father, Nicholas Brend.. Heminges sold off his shares from 1630-1634, primarily to John Shank, comedian with the King's Men. William's sales to Shank earned him ¬£156 in 1633 and ¬£350 in 1634. William \\"was then in difficulties, and Shank disbursed additional small sums to him in prison.\\"E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 2, p. 323. Shank's sudden wealth in theatre shares (two shares in the Blackfriars and three in the Globe) provoked three other members of the King's Men, Robert Benfield, Thomas Pollard, and Eliard Swanston, to petition the Lord Chamberlain for a more equitable division of the wealth. The resulting controversy generated what are often termed the \\"Sharers's papers,\\" documents that provide significant information of the theatrical conditions of the time.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564‚Äì1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 448-9.

The film premiered in Japan on March 7, 2009. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom by Eureka on May 12, 2012, while Discotek Media released the film in North America in 2013. Plot In Tokyoko, a fictional city sporting various homages of Tatsunoko Production works, the Doronbo Gang have seemingly destroyed a large part of the city. The heroic Yatterman duo make their entrance with Yatterwoof (Yamadera, voice), a sentient dog-shaped mecha and Toybotty (Takahashi, voice), their robot sidekick. After a series of slapstick combat scenes, the Doronbo trio flee back to their mecha to defeat Yatterwan. Cheering at their first victory, the villains accidentally hit the mecha's self-destruct button. When the chaos clears, a teenage girl emerges from the ruins with a blue object in her hands. The Narrator (Yamadera) explains Gan Takada (a.k.a. Yatterman #1, Sakurai) and his girlfriend, Ai Kaminari (a.k.a. Yatterman #2, Fukuda), live a double life as crime-fighting heroes. They are based under Takada Toys, founded by Gan's father. Gan built Toybotty and Yatterwoof, the latter an abandoned plan from his father. The girl they found in the ruins was Shoko Kaieda (Okamoto), daughter of Dr. Kaieda (Abu), an archaeologist. The piece of blue stone Shoko carries is a part of the Skull Stone, a legendary object now split into four pieces. Dr Kaieda, who is on a quest to find them, is attacked in the forest of Narway by Skullobey (Takeguchi), a black-clad being with an oversized skull. The Doronbo Trio is then introduced. The gang includes Doronjo, the sexy female boss; Boyacky (Namase), the clever but lecherous mecha genius; and Tonzra, the gluttonous, kansai-ben-speaking strongman. Skullobey sends them orders to find the Skull Stone pieces, and will punish them should they fail. The trio open a wedding store called \\"Doro Merry\\" to raise money to build a new mecha: the , a very feminine-looking construction. A robot skull arrives to deliver Skullobey's message: another Stone is in Ogypt, and the Doronbo trio must find it without losing Shoko. The skull self-destructs. Unknown to the trio, Toybotty witnesses everything and reports back to Gan and Ai. The duo transform into Yatterman and set off for Ogypt. When the group discover the missing piece, the villains arrive on the scene. They again use their mecha to damage Yatterwoof. After consuming a Mechanade thrown by Gan, the dog robot releases a swarm of ant robots which destroy the Bridesmaidiot, dragging Yatterwoof with it. Back home, Gan tries to rebuild Yatterwoof while Ai, jealous of Shoko and Doronjo goes out for a walk. The trio receive another message that another piece of the Stone is in the Southern Halps. It is then revealed that Skullobey wants Doronjo for himself. Meanwhile, things around the world start to disappear, and before he can tell the truth behind the Skull Stone pieces, Toybotty, who has been analyzing the Stone, disappears, as well. Ai discovers another scam by the villains, involving a sushi restaurant, to raise money for their new robot, a giant squid. She also overhears that the last piece is hidden in the Southern Halps. The Doronbo trio then set out in a Squid mecha. Upon returning to base, Gan reads the analysis made by Toybotty before it disappeared: the Skull pieces, put back together, will destroy the flow of time itself, causing the disappearance of all things. The only way to stop this is to destroy the Stone when the pieces are reunited. The Yatterman duo set out with Shoko riding Yatterking, an upgraded Yatterwoof. The trio find the final piece. When the heroes arrive, Skullobey encases them in a giant dome filled with clockworks. Doronjo zaps Ai to force the Yatterman duo apart, only to finally discover the true love between Gan and Ai. Shoko realizes Skullobey has possessed her father and due to her pleas, Dr. Kaieda is able to free himself from Skullobey and reveal his true form. Fighting as a unit again, Yatterman #1 and #2 team up with a reformed Doronbo Gang, defeat Skullobey and trap him in the other world. Later, Gan and Ai bid Shoko and her father farewell, who leave to explore the world some more while the Doronbo Gang goes their separate ways. However, because their paths reassemble into a single road, they will meet again.

(ca. 1440 - 1522) was a Spanish mathematician, music theorist, and composer. His only surviving work is the Latin treatise Musica practica.Available in an English translation by Clement A. Miller (American Institute of Musicology, 1993). By his own testimony at the end of his Musica practica, Ramos de Pareja was born in Baeza, possibly around 1440. Most of the biographical details of his life must be culled from this treatise. He says that he was a student of Juan de Monte and that he obtained the chair of music at the University of Salamanca for his commentaries on the works of Boethius (cum Boetium in musica legeremus). At Salamanca he had many debates with Pedro de Osma concerning his musical theories. In 1482, when he published his Musica, he revolutionarily proposed a new, five-limit division of the monochord, breaking from the Pythagorean system that had dominated the medieval ars antiqua through Boethius and Guido of Arezzo. This system of musical tuning yielded consonant perfect fourths and fifths, but the thirds and sixths were rough.Donald Jay Grout and Claude V. Palisca (2001), A History of Western Music, 6th ed. (New York: W. W. Norton & Co, ), p. 148. Ramos de Pareja's new division was only slowly accepted. Afterwards he worked in Italy, primarily at Bologna, where his theories engendered serious controversy, even polemics, from conservatives such as Franchino Gaffurio. After a long stay there he moved to Rome, where he died shortly after 1521. Ramos de Pareja sought to heal the divide between music in theory and in practice. To this end he sought to render the dissonant thirds and sixths consonant. He proposed the intervals 5/4, 6/5, 5/3, and 8/5 for the division of the monochord, subsequently accepted universally. Less successful was his attempt to replace hexachordal notation with a system of eight syllables denoting the eight sounds of a diatonic scale: psal-li-tur-per-vo-ces-is-tas. The Musica practica also contains interesting commentary on mensural notation, chromatic alterations, examples of counterpoint, musical instruments, and the division of music and its effects. Ramos de Pareja was the first theorist to label the method now known as the Guidonian hand the manus Guidonis; prior to him it was called the manus musicalis. He chose the title Musica practica to emphasise the practical rather than the theoretical/mathematical component of music. Throughout Ramos de Pareja alludes to his own compositions, though few survive.

United States, 246 U.S. 231 (1918), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States applied the \\"rule of reason\\" to the internal trading rules of a commodity market. Section 1 of the Sherman Act flatly states: \\"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.\\"Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, ¬ß 1 (excerpt). However, in evaluating the U.S. government's allegations that the Chicago Board of Trade's rules on grain prices violated the Act, the Supreme Court rejected a strict interpretation of its language: \\"The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.\\" Facts Defendant Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) is a commodity market, dealing in spot sales (sales of grain stored in Chicago and ready for delivery), future sales (grain to be purchased for delivery at a later time), and ‚Äúto arrive‚Äù orders (grain which is en route to Chicago). CBOT introduced a new ‚Äúcall rule‚Äù which regulated board members buying or selling sales of ‚Äúto arrive‚Äù orders‚Äîat the close of the call session (which at that point was 2:00 p.m Central Time), the price of grain is set and dealers can't sell grain at any other price. The United States Department of Justice accused CBOT of price-fixing, and in 1913, filed suit against the Board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. At trial, CBOT asserted that the rule did not have any unlawful purpose, but rather was set up to curb certain pre-existing problems and abuses. CBOT claimed that a group of agents were lowering discounts on commissions to those people buying grain after hours. These agents would wait until after hours, and then buyers would get cheaper prices. CBOT wanted to curb the power of these monopsony/oligopsony type of buyers by making prices the same for everyone after hours. Also, the rule shortened the traders‚Äô work hours, for the convenience of its members. Ultimately, however, the District Court did not issue an opinion. The Justice Department and CBOT entered into a consent decree under which enjoined them from acting upon the same or from adopting or acting upon any similar rule. Judgment Justice Brandeis, writing for a unanimous court, first observed that every trade association and board of trade imposes some restraint upon the conduct of its members. He explained the essence of the Rule of Reason: \\"The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.\\" Whether or not a rule restrains trade in violation of the Sherman Act thus turns on the facts and circumstances of each particular case. He then examined the nature, scope, effect, and history of the rule. He held that the call rule was ultimately procompetitive in purpose and effect. The scope of the rule was such that it only operated during certain times of day, and affects only small percentage of the grain market. The rule helped to create public market for grain and made pricing more transparent. It decreased the market power of dominant sellers and made sure that prices were set by open competitive bidding. The decree of the District Court was reversed.

Biography Born on December 19, 1953, the grandson of Slovak immigrants, Dzurilla grew up in Carteret, New Jersey. His family moved to Holly Hill, Florida, and he graduated from Mainland High School in Daytona Beach. He received his B.A. degree from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 1978, and his J.D. from Tulane Law School in 1981. After graduation, he clerked for Judge Albert Tate of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit from 1981 to 1982 and then for Justice Byron White of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1982 to 1983.Dennis J. Hutchinson, The Man Who Once Was Whizzer White: A Portrait of Justice Byron R. White, p. 197 (1998) (listing clerks of Justice White) After completing his clerkship, Dzurilla joined the New Orleans firm of Gordon Arata McCollam & Duplantis, where he stayed for 15 years. He worked with his former co-clerk Patricia A.

The commission's work led to the enactment of the 1993 Constitution of Russia. However, as a result of the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, the final version differed from the commission's draft by substantially increasing the powers of the president.Chenoy, supra at 54-61 In 1998, Dzurilla accepted a Fulbright Scholarship to teach law at the Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia.

It was originally established in 1955, was subsequently abolished, but was eventually reestablished. This Commission is responsible for overseeing oil and gas drilling and production, reservoir depletion, and certain other operations on private and state-owned lands in Alaska. History A territorial statute created the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in 1955, before Alaska became a state in 1959. At that time, the Commission comprised the Territorial Governor, Commissioner of Mines, and Highway Engineer. Rules and regulations for the Commission's activities took effect in 1958. In 1959, the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission was temporarily abolished, and its duties were transferred to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. In 1968, the Division of Oil and Gas was formed within the Department of Natural Resources. In 1976, the word \\"conservation\\" was added back to the division's title, and it became the Division of Oil and Gas Conservation. In 1977, with oil production occurring in Prudhoe Bay, the Alaska Legislature decided that an independent quasi- judicial agency should be created in the executive branch of the state. The present independent agency was at first located within the Department of Natural Resources, but in 1980 was transferred to the Department of Commerce and Economic Development. In 1994, it was transferred to the Department of Administration. Structure The structure of the membership has changed throughout the years, though it has consistently been a three-person Commission. Under the current structure, adopted in 1979, one member must be a registered petroleum engineer, one member must be a registered geologist, and one member must represent the public at large (i.e., a citizen in neither of the two categories listed above). Mission The Commission is tasked to work in-hand with the oil industry to maximize production, administer correlative rights, and improve resource recovery. It also administers an underground injection program for enhanced oil recovery and underground disposal of oil field waste, as authorized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. As part of this injection process, oil corporations must obtain an Aquifer Exemption Order granted by the AOGCC in areas with deep groundwater supplies. Some environmental groups such as the Cook Inletkeeper as well as First Nation People have contested these Orders, fearing they may contaminate groundwater supplies. The Commission also holds oversight of wastewater disposal known as \\"wastewater drain fields\\"; as such, oil corporations are permitted to dispose of wastewater in the soil when certain requirements are met, and reject Orders when not met. Additionally, the Commission adjudicates certain oil and gas disputes between owners, including disputes where the state is a party. It is designed to cooperate with industry, while still meeting its regulatory requirements. The Commission website lists their primary mission, \\"To protect the public interest in exploration and development of Alaska's valuable oil, gas, and geothermal resources through the application of conservation practices designed to ensure greater ultimate recovery and the protection of health, safety, fresh ground waters and the rights of all owners to recover their share of the resource.\\"\\"Home, Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, Department of Administration, State of Alaska\\" Though the Cook Inletkeeper website notes of toxic waste are disposed of in the Cook Inlet waterway every year by oil corporations References External links * 1955 establishments in Alaska Energy in Alaska Energy policy of the United States Government agencies established in 1955 Organizations based in Anchorage, Alaska Oil ","title":"Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission"},{"id":"19111439","text":"Foll may refer to: * Harry Foll, an Australian politician * St√©phane Le Foll, a French politician * The Followers in Australian rules football See also * Folle * Folles ","title":"Foll"},{"id":"19111440","text":"Prince Giorgi Eristavi Giorgi Eristavi () (1813 ‚Äì September 9, 1864) was a Georgian playwright, poet, journalist, and the founder of modern Georgian theatre. Prince Giorgi Eristavi was born in the village of Odzisi (near Dusheti) of a prominent noble family, who had once served as the eristavi (\\"duke\\") of Ksani for the kings of Georgia. He received his early education in Tiflis and Moscow. On return to Georgia, he became involved with the underground society which plotted a coup against the Imperial Russian rule. He had his first poem published in 1832. This was An Ossetic Tale (·Éù·É°·É£·É†·Éò ·Éõ·Éù·Éó·ÉÆ·É†·Éù·Éë·Éê; revised and republished as Zare and Qanimat, ·Éñ·Éê·É†·Éî ·Éì·Éê ·Éß·Éê·Éú·Éò·Éõ·Éê·Éó, in 1853), a story of ill-fated lovers set against the background of the struggle of Georgian and Ossetian mountaineers against the Persian armies of Shah Abbas I in the 17th century.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History, pp. 154-157. Routledge, . After the collapse of the anti-Russian plot in 1832, Eristavi spent a year in prison and four years as an exiled infantryman in Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania), where he mastered Polish and came under the influence of Adam Mickiewicz's Romanticism. In 1842, he was able to permanently return to Georgia where he married and joined the Russian civil service soon to become assistant to the Viceroy of the Caucasus Mikhail Vorontsov. Under the patronage of this liberal viceroy, Eristavi took charge of the Georgian theatre in Tiflis, dormant since 1795. The company premiered on January 1, 1851 and was later able to stage its performances in the new theatre building in the city‚Äôs central square. He almost single-handedly created and directed a troupe and wrote first actable comedies ‚Äì original as well as translated ‚Äì in which he himself took leading parts. He also created and edited the 24 issues of the literary journal Tsiskari (\\"Down\\") and, under the pseudonym Glukharich (Russian for \\"son of the deaf, or capercaillie\\"), wrote the first literary reviews. In spite of Eristavi‚Äôs loyal service in the Russian administration, the imperial government as well as the eroding system of Georgian aristocracy was a frequent subject of indignation and satire in his best plays such as The Lawsuit (·Éì·Éê·Éï·Éê; 1840), and The Family Settlement (·Éí·Éê·Éß·É†·Éê; 1849). Eristavi boldly attacks a degenerating Georgian noble, who has lost all of his ideals and has much envy and anger, exploiting his serfs; a corrupt Russian bureaucrat and an Armenian money-lender who exploit the feuding gentry; and treats the newer, Russian-educated generation of idealist liberals with condescending sympathy. These plays had a popular support and were tolerated by Vorontsov.Lang, David Marshall (1962), A Modern History of Georgia, pp. 89-90. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. However, after Vorontsov's departure from Georgia in 1854, Eristavi was forced to resign. He retired to the village of Khidistavi near Gori. His prot√©g√© and successor, Ivane Kereselidze, was able to keep the company for only two years and, in 1856, the theatre went defunct. Apart from comedies, lyrics and journalism, Eristavi also wrote an account of his 1862 journey to London to inspect machinery. He died in Gori in 1864 and was buried at the Ikorta church.

It was chartered by BHP Shipping in 1990. On 10 July 1995 it was nearing the end of a voyage transporting 24,000 tonnes of manganese ore from Groote Eylandt via Port Kembla to the port of Launceston in northern Tasmania, Australia. Weather conditions at the time were north- westerly 37‚Äì46 km/h (20‚Äì25 knot) winds and two-metre seas. It grounded on Hebe Reef as it approached the mouth of the Tamar River and began leaking bunker fuel oil. The crew was safely evacuated. Salvage work commenced and the first casualties of the incident, a dead penguin and three dead cormorants, were recovered by 13 July. At that time 200 penguins had been taken into care. On 16 July the Iron Baron was refloated and moved to an offshore anchorage. Underwater inspections confirmed that it had incurred major structural damage and was continuing to deteriorate. With further bad weather predicted, it was decided by BHP to dump the ship. It was towed to an approved disposal site east of Flinders Island where it sank on 30 July. Environmental impact An estimated 325 tonnes of heavy bunker fuel oil was spilled from the vessel in the course of its grounding, refloating and towing to the disposal ground. Several beaches and islands in north-eastern Tasmania were affected and a major clean-up and wildlife rescue effort was undertaken. Little penguins were especially badly affected with 1894 oiled birds collected for treatment and rehabilitation.

The text is historically significant because it contains one of the earliest evaluations of early Christianity by a non-Christian author.Van Voorst, pp 58-64. Summary Modern photograph of the stadium at Olympia, where Peregrinus is reported to have publicly immolated himself. Lucian writes his account as a letter to Cronius the Pythagorean, a Platonist philosopher. He tells Cronius that Peregrinus has burned himself to death at the recent Olympics. The author assumes that Cronius will find this news greatly amusing and gratifying.Lucian, 1-2. The narrative then shifts to Elis where Lucian, having just arrived, overhears Peregrinus's follower Theagenes compare Peregrinus, or Proteus, to Heracles and even Zeus himself. Theagenes announces Peregrinus's plan to kill himself through fire.Lucian, 3-5. Following Theagenes's speech Lucian enters the story as a double character. This double admonishes the crowd and provides an account of Peregrinus's life from his perspective. According to Lucian's double, Peregrinus was caught in adultery in Armenia shortly after entering manhood, seduced a youth and bribed the child's parents, and killed his own father.Lucian, 7-10. According to Lucian's double, Peregrinus exiled himself after this and wandered until he arrived in Palestine where he learned under the Christians. With the Christians, Peregrinus became an influential leader and author, and was \\"honored...as a god\\".Lucian, 11. During this period, Peregrinus was imprisoned for his being revered \\"as a god\\" and \\"as a lawgiver\\" and was cared for by Christians from throughout the province of Asia who regarded him according to Lucian as ‚Äúthe new Socrates‚Äù.Lucian, 12. Hoping to avoid making a martyr out of Peregrinus, according to Lucian, the governor of Syria released Peregrinus.Lucian, 14. After returning home, Lucian writes that Peregrinus faced threats of prosecution over the death of his father and left his father's land (30 talents according to Lucian, 5 thousand according to Theagenes) to the city of Parium to escape punishment. It is at this point that Peregrinus began to appear as a Cynic, or ‚Äúwith his hair now grown long, wearing a dirty cloak, a pouch at his side and a staff in his hand‚Äù.Lucian, 15. After this Lucian claims that Peregrinus broke Christian dietary laws and was excommunicated from the church. Without their funding Lucian claims that Peregrinus attempted to reclaim his property from Parium, but lost his claim. Upon losing his case Peregrinus set out to Egypt where he trained as an ascetic and demonstrated his Cynic indifference to society by masturbating in a large crowd. Sailing to Rome, Peregrinus began to speak out in public against various officials including the Emperor, who ignored him, before being sent away by the city prefect.Lucian, 16-18. Returning to Greece, he began speaking out again, this time against the Eleans, the Romans, and Herodes Atticus who had recently constructed an aqueduct. After nearly being stoned, Peregrinus fled to Zeus's sanctuary and renounced his former opinions about the aqueduct.Lucian, 19-20. At the following Olympics, Peregrinus proclaimed his intention to burn himself to death at the following games. Lucian decries his methods, saying that while he intends on following Heracles he is more similar to the arsonist who burned the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus.Lucian, 22. Lucian then makes a prophecy about Peregrinus's future followers and includes two prophecies: one from the Sybil, related by Theagenes which compares Peregrinus to Heracles, and a second from the oracle of Bacis which calls for his followers to follow him in killing themselves or face stoning. Lucian's double ends his speech, and the crowd calls for Peregrinus's death.Lucian, 29-31. Switching back to the first person Lucian announces that Peregrinus arrived with his followers and delivered a speech comparing himself to Heracles before being applauded by ‚Äúthe more stupid of the people‚Äù.Lucian, 33. Announcing his cremation would take place in the evening at Harpina, Peregrinus poured incense on the pyre and shouted ‚ÄúSpirits of my mother and father, receive me favorably‚Äù before entering the flames.Lucian, 36. Ending his letter Lucian again remarks that Cronius will find these events humorous as he himself did.Lucian, 37. He describes a false account of the death that he gave to several followers of Peregrinus in which the cremation was followed by an earthquake and a vulture emerging from the smoke. Lucian also mentions that in his past he shared a voyage from Troas with Peregrinus, who he found to be quite cowardly.Lucian, 43-44. Lucian claims that Peregrinus‚Äîsick with fever‚Äîfeared death on the ship, saying, ‚ÄúBut that way would bring less renown, being common to everyone‚Äù.Lucian, 44. Lucian‚Äôs satirical purpose Lucian's work can be faulted for its bias if it is read as a straightforward historical account of Peregrinus's life and death. However, it is a work of satire, with several possible purposes. His presentation of facts is sometimes motivated by his intention to attack beliefs that he viewed as disingenuous, na√Øve, or superstitious. Several scholars have attempted to divine Lucian's purpose in order to better judge the veracity of his account. According to Mark Edwards, satire \\"seeks, not truth, but the characteristic and the probable\\".Edwards, p. 89 Along these lines, Lucian shows that Peregrinus, rather than being the consummate Cynic, was actually a fake, and that early Christianity was home to the most radically out-of-step Cynics at that time. Edwards argues that Lucian's character Philosophy in The Fugitives makes a distinction between the admirable deaths of the Brahmins and the less honorable lives of the pretenders, led by Peregrinus, who only care for the appearance of these virtues in order to avoid work and accumulate wealth.Edwards, p. 92 Another avenue for Lucian's attack on Peregrinus, according to Stephen Benko, is the act of suicide, and how Peregrinus carries it out. Lucian mentions the example of the Brahmins, who killed themselves in a more honorable manner than Peregrinus who sought out attention. Benko claims that the manner of Peregrinus's suicide seems to have been shaped in some part by the public martyrdom of early Christians like Polycarp.Benko, p. 43. Mark Edwards argues that Lucian also attacks the Christian claims of a strong moral code by having Peregrinus both break several of these laws (adultery, murder) and gain a high place in the church.Edwards, p. 95. Edwards claims that this is in response to Aristides' argument against the divinity of Zeus. Aristides argues that \\"How then can a god be an adulterer, a pederast, and the murderer of his own father?\\" Lucian assigns all three roles to Peregrinus, and notes that he was honored ‚Äúas a god‚Äù by the Christians. Edwards points out that the Christian apologists' claims to philosophic strength is challenged by Lucian through the judgment of the governor of Syria. The governor has an interest in philosophy, but has no interest for the Christian Peregrinus and frees him in order to avoid making a martyr out of him. C. P. Jones writes that Lucian uses the format of a letter to Cronius as a way to legitimize his opinion of Peregrinus, and set up a dichotomy in which his views represent the realm of reason, while the Cynics are fanatics.Jones, pp. 117-119. This can be seen in his frequent remarks that Cronius will have found his account incredibly amusing. Jones also argues that Theagenes's comparison of Peregrinus to both Heracles and Zeus is meant to further discredit him amongst his followers. Finally, he argues that Lucian's account of his own creation of legends involving Peregrinus's death is meant to discredit his surviving followers. Jones writes that these same legends were currently being spread around the growing group of followers of Peregrinus, and so Lucian's careless creation of them shows the foolishly high level of credulity among the followers. Historical criticism Although The Passing of the Peregrinus is clearly satirical, several modern historians have criticized it for inaccuracies concerning the details of Peregrinus's life. In addition to the bias in his account, some critics argue that Lucian misses several key historical facts about the church that Peregrinus interacted with as well as major events that may have shaped his life. Stephen Benko criticizes Lucian's negative portrayal of Peregrinus as being the result of his own narrow opinion that belief in the supernatural was ridiculous. Disputing Lucian's presentation of Christians as easily fooled simpletons, Benko notes that the Didache warns congregations about travelers who stayed more than two or three days without working.Benko, p. 39. Benko also argues that Lucian's views on Peregrinus's attitude toward death may have been influenced by the general public opinion of Christian martyrs and their own attitudes toward death.Benko, p. 40. Lucian's take on the Christians' attitudes towards death comes when he writes: Gilbert Bagani argues that Lucian is wrong about the nature of the charges Peregrinus received as well as his eventual pardon. Bagani points out that Trajan's orders to Pliny would not have allowed for the governor to simply pardon a self-professed Christian like Peregrinus who had had charges brought against him on the matter.Bagani, p. 110. Instead he proposes that the arrest was made as part of a larger crackdown following the Bar Kochba revolt, and he was released when his jailers realized that he was not related to the insurrection. Bagani also argues that Peregrinus's excommunication may have been based on his refusal to eat pork, rather than his eating sacrificial meat as has been supposed.Bagani, pp. 110‚Äì111 He bases this on the hypothesis that the Christian sect was heavily Jewish in their origin before the revolt and Peregrinus's imprisonment, but after the revolt it became more heavily Gentile and accepting of those who consumed pork. Peregrinus's ties to the earlier congregation would have presented a difficulty in this manner. C. P. Jones argues that Lucian changed the order of Peregrinus's gift of land to Parium and his excommunication for satirical purposes.Jones, p. 123. By stating that Peregrinus only gave up his land because he was under the expectation that he could live off of the kindness of other Christians, and then backtracked on the gift when this possibility was taken away, Lucian undermines Peregrinus's claim to have given up his possessions for a more high-minded purpose. Relationship between Cynics and Christians Three Christian writers wrote about Peregrinus after his death. Tertullian remarks that while Peregrinus had died a pagan, his willingness to suffer was an example to Christians.Tertullian, Ad Martyras 4.5. Tatian, a Greek apologist, is heavily critical of Peregrinus and other Cynics. He writes: \\"They say they want nothing, yet like Proteus, they need a currier for their wallet, and a weaver for their mantle, and a woodcutter for their staff, and the rich, and a cook also for their gluttony.\\" Tatian describes a state of war between Cynics, in whose lot he includes Peregrinus, and Christians. In fact Crescens, who had brought charges against the apologist Justin Martyr, was a Cynic. Athenagoras mocks Peregrinus's death as well as the attention it received and insinuates that he should not be considered a martyr.Athenagoras, Legatio 26.2-4. He also describes a statue of Peregrinus built in Greece that supposedly has oracular powers. He argues that these powers must not come from Peregrinus. Stephen Benko argues that Peregrinus and other Cynics presented an image of asceticism that was ultimately incorporated into Christian monasticism.Benko, p. 30. Cynics were supposed to live with few possessions, have little worldly ambition, and were forced to endure severe training or \\"Askesis\\". Benko compares this training to that undergone by monks in the Egyptian desert.Benko, p. 48. Other contemporary texts that mention Peregrinus Three other close contemporaries of Peregrinus mention him in existent literature. Aulus Gellius in Noctes Atticae describes Peregrinus as a ‚Äúserious and disciplined man‚Äù.Clay, p. 3431 He also attributes to Peregrinus the idea that philosophers never do wrong even though they do not fear detection by men or the gods, while less righteous men need the deterrent of detection by one or the other to avoid sinning. Philostratus the younger writes about Peregrinus in connection with Herodes, the builder of the aqueduct in Elis. He calls Herodes calm for his measured response.Clay, p. 3432 Philostraus the elder also mentions Peregrinus in connection with Herodes and his criticism. Lucian also mentions Peregrinus in The Fugitives, which he begins with a scene involving Zeus complaining about the stench of Peregrinus's burning corpse reaching him and the gods.

A total of 420 were built during World War II. It saw action with German mountain divisions in Finland, Italy, France, on the Eastern Front and in the Balkans from 1942. It served with a number of European countries into the 1960s. Development and description The 10.5 cm GebH 40 was designed to meet an Army requirement for a 10.5 cm howitzer to serve in the mountain divisions (Gebirgs Divisionen). Both Rheinmetall and B√∂hler submitted designs for troop trials in 1940 and B√∂hler was selected for production, although actual production did not begin until 1942.Gander and Chamberlain, p. 289 Some 420 were built between 1942‚Äì45. The design of the 10.5 cm GebH 40 was relatively conventional in regard to the gun itself, with its standard German horizontal sliding block breech, split trail carriage with removable spades, and muzzle brake, but the carriage differed considerably from those typically used in the German army. The wheels were made from light- alloy with solid rubber tires, and their spring suspension was fixed to the legs of the split-trail carriage and would \\"toe-in\\" when the legs were spread out in preparation for firing. A firing pedestal was positioned underneath the front of the carriage so that the howitzer had three points of support when firing and also minimized the time needed to find a firing position by reducing the amount of level space required (three level spots being easier to find than four). It could be either towed fully assembled, broken down into four loads on single-axle trailers towed by Sd.Kfz. 2 \\"Kettenkrad\\" half-track motorcycles or broken down into five pack-loads to be carried by mules. It remains the heaviest mountain howitzer ever made at , but some consider it one of the best mountain guns ever made and it remained in service until the 1960s with various European countries.Hogg, p. 34 Two different range figures have been quoted for the 10.5 cm GebH 40, and .Hogg, p. 35 The former figure seems more plausible when compared to 10.5 cm howitzers with roughly similar barrel lengths and muzzle velocities like the 10.5 cm leFH 18 and the American M-2. Ammunition The 10.5 cm GebH 40 fired a wide variety of ammunition, with the notable exception of a conventional armor-piercing shell. It used instead the standard three types of 10.5 cm hollow-charge armor-piercing shells developed over the course of the war and shared its illumination shell with the 10.5 cm leFH 18. However it used unique high-explosive and smoke shells. It used six increments of propellant which were added together to reach the desired range. A seventh charge could be used which replaced all the other charges for targets at the limit of the howitzer's range.Hogg, pp. 35‚Äì6 References Sources * Engelmann, Joachim and Scheibert, Horst.

Nodding greenhoods have flowers which \\"nod\\" or lean forwards strongly, have a deeply notched sinus and a curved, hairy labellum.Pterostylis nutans rosette Description Pterostylis nutans has a rosette of between three and six egg- shaped to elliptic leaves, each leaf long and wide. The leaves are dark green, have a wavy edge and a distinct petiole. A single translucent white flower with green stripes and brown colouration is borne on a flowering spike high, the flower strongly \\"nodding\\" or leaning forwards. The flowers are long, wide. There is a wide gap at each side of the flower between the petals and the lateral sepals. The lateral sepals curve forwards, have a tapering tip, long and there is a deeply notched sinus between them. The labellum protrudes from the flower and is long, wide, curved, blunt, green and brown and covered with short, bristly hairs. Flowering occurs from March to December. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis nutans was first described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (nutans) is a Latin word meaning \\"nodding\\" or \\"drooping\\". Distribution and habitat Nodding greenhoods often occur in large colonies in moist, protected forest environments and is native to the Australian states of South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland as well as the Australian Capital Territory. In Queensland it grows as far north as the Atherton Tableland, in the eastern half of New South Wales, the southern half of Victoria, the south-eastern corner of South Australia and in Tasmania, including King and Flinders Islands. It has also been found in New Zealand but is regarded as a vagrant there because the insect pollinator is not present in that country. There is a single population remaining near the Waihaha River, although there have been records from Kaitaia and Castor Bay. Ecology This greenhood is pollinated by a particular species of fungus gnat, attracted by a kairomone produced by the flower's labellum. The labellum tips the insect into the flower, and in attempting to escape, it comes into contact with the sexual organs of the flower and pollination occurs. Use in horticulture Pterostylis nutans is easily grown in pots containing a free-draining, sandy mix. The plants require regular watering during their growing period, to be kept dry during dormancy and to be repotted annually.

Variants include the 1‚Äì9‚Äì90 rule (sometimes 90‚Äì9‚Äì1 principle or the 89:10:1 ratio), which states that in a collaborative website such as a wiki, 90% of the participants of a community only consume content, 9% of the participants change or update content, and 1% of the participants add content. Similar rules are known in information science; for instance, the 80/20 rule known as the Pareto principle states that 20 percent of a group will produce 80 percent of the activity, however the activity is defined. Definition According to the 1% rule, about 1% of Internet users are responsible for creating content, while 99% are merely consumers of that content. For example, for every person who posts on a forum, generally about 99 other people view that forum but do not post. The term was coined by authors and bloggers Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba, although earlier references to the same concept did not use this name. The terms lurk and lurking, in reference to online activity, are used to refer to online observation without engaging others in the community. A 2005 study of radical Jihadist forums found 87% of users had never posted on the forums, 13% had posted at least once, 5% had posted 50 or more times, and only 1% had posted 500 or more times. A 2014 peer-reviewed paper entitled \\"The 1% Rule in Four Digital Health Social Networks: An Observational Study\\" empirically examined the 1% rule in health oriented online forums. The paper concluded that the 1% rule was consistent across the four support groups, with a handful of \\"Superusers\\" generating the vast majority of content. A study later that year, from a separate group of researchers, replicated the 2014 van Mierlo study in an online forum for depression. Results indicated that the distribution frequency of the 1% rule fit followed Zipf's Law, which is a specific type of a power law. The \\"90‚Äì9‚Äì1\\" version of this rule states that for websites where users can both create and edit content, 1% of people create content, 9% edit or modify that content, and 90% view the content without contributing. The actual percentage is likely to vary depending upon the subject matter. For example, if a forum requires content submissions as a condition of entry, the percentage of people who participate will probably be significantly higher than one percent, but the content producers will still be a minority of users. This is validated in a study conducted by Michael Wu, who uses economics techniques to analyze the participation inequality across hundreds of communities segmented by industry, audience type, and community focus. The 1% rule is often misunderstood to apply to the Internet in general, but it applies more specifically to any given Internet community. It is for this reason that one can see evidence for the 1% principle on many websites, but aggregated together one can see a different distribution. This latter distribution is still unknown and likely to shift, but various researchers and pundits have speculated on how to characterize the sum total of participation. Research in late 2012 suggested that only 23% of the population (rather than 90 percent) could properly be classified as lurkers, while 17% of the population could be classified as intense contributors of content. Several years prior, results were reported on a sample of students from Chicago where 60 percent of the sample created content in some form. Participation inequality A similar concept was introduced by Will Hill of AT&T; Laboratories and later cited by Jakob Nielsen; this was the earliest known reference to the term \\"participation inequality\\" in an online context. The term regained public attention in 2006 when it was used in a strictly quantitative context within a blog entry on the topic of marketing.

There have been a number of nuclear whistleblowers, often nuclear engineers, who have identified safety concerns about nuclear power and nuclear weapons production. In 1976 Gregory Minor, Richard Hubbard and Dale Bridenbaugh \\"blew the whistle\\" on safety problems at nuclear power plants in the United States, and Fukushima in Japan. George Galatis was a senior nuclear engineer who reported safety problems at the Millstone 1 Nuclear Power Plant, relating to reactor refueling procedures, in 1996.Eric Pooley. Nuclear Warriors Time Magazine, 4 March 1996. Other nuclear power whistleblowers include Arnold Gundersen and David Lochbaum. Karen Silkwood The first prominent nuclear whistleblower was Karen Silkwood, who worked as a chemical technician at a Kerr-McGee nuclear fuel plant. Silkwood became an activist in the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union in order to protest health and safety issues. In 1974, she testified to the United States Atomic Energy Commission about her concerns. A few months later she died in a car crash under mysterious conditions on the way to a meeting with a New York Times reporter and a national union leader. The 1983 film Silkwood is an account of this story. The \\"GE Three\\" On 2 February 1976, Gregory C. Minor, Richard B. Hubbard, and Dale G. Bridenbaugh (known as the GE Three) \\"blew the whistle\\" on safety problems at nuclear power plants, and their action has been called \\"an exemplary instance of whistleblowing\\".Whistleblower on Nuclear Plant Safety The three engineers gained the attention of journalists and their disclosures about the threats of nuclear power had a significant impact. They timed their statements to coincide with their resignations from responsible positions in General Electric's nuclear energy division, and later established themselves as consultants on the nuclear power industry for state governments, federal agencies, and overseas governments. The consulting firm they formed, MHB Technical Associates, was technical advisor for the movie, \\"The China Syndrome.\\" The three engineers participated in Congressional hearings which their disclosures precipitated. Browns Ferry Unit 1 under construction Browns Ferry nuclear power plant construction began in 1966. It was located in Alabama and in 1967 it earned a federal construction permit. The plant received new design standards which call for \\"physical separation of electrical cables.\\" Weil, Vivian. \\"Moral Responsibility and Whistleblowing in the Nuclear Industry: Browns Ferry and Three Mile Island.\\" (1983). There was an issue with the instructions on how to accomplish this so the AEC inspector F.U. Bower requested that the AEC elaborate; however, there was no response from the organization and installation went on. Still, no instructions were issued after five failed inspections in 1970. The lack of cable separation instructions led to the sacrifice of safety coolant systems in two of the units in order to improve one with severe safety violation. The ignorance of the AEC led to the fire that occurred on 22 March 1975, that almost led to a radiation leak. The substance separating the wires caught fire when tests to find air leaks with a candle ignited it thus resulting in damage to the control systems. With damage to the control systems, the cooling system that keeps the units from leaking radiation did not work properly. Somehow the situation was avoided and the units were put out of service. Throughout the occurrence of these events Bridenbaugh had been discussing his reservations on the safety at the plant in vain and in 1976 a year later Bridenbaugh, Hubbard and Minor resigned. Crystal River 3 and Lou Putney Lou Putney came on the scene of the Crystal River 3 plant after receiving a call from a plant engineer. The engineer claimed that the managers hired engineers based on \\"good ol' boy mentality.\\"Riggs, Stephanie. \\"FLORIDA POWER AND THE CRYSTAL RIVER NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.\\" (1997). The plant had experience numerous shut downs since 1978. Along with this concern, the engineer was not confident that the manager possessed the qualifications to be a manager. Although the engineer pursued nothing further with his complaint, it prompted Putney to purchase shares of stock in the company that would allow him to file \\"shareholder resolutions.\\" Putney had looked into the nuclear reactors that were built of an unsafe material for emergency cooling procedures. The NRC had placed Crystal River on the top 14 worst reactors list because of this. So, the shares were purchased in 1981, which is when Putney filed his first shareholder resolution requesting the plant be shut down. This tradition was upheld by Putney for seven years until he was required to purchase more stock in order to continue filing resolutions. Over the course of sixteen years, Putney filed a total of fourteen shareholder resolutions. All of these resolutions were ignored and were met with offers to buy out his shares so he could no longer file the resolutions. The plant was officially decommissioned in September 2009. Ronald Goldstein Ronald J. Goldstein was a supervisor employed by EBASCO, which was a major contractor for the construction of the South Texas plants. In the summer of 1985, Goldstein identified safety problems to SAFETEAM, an internal compliance program established by EBASCO and Houston Lighting, including noncompliance with safety procedures, the failure to issue safety compliance reports, and quality control violations affecting the safety of the plant. SAFETEAM was promoted as an independent safe haven for employees to voice their safety concerns. The two companies did not inform their employees that they did not believe complaints reported to SAFETEAM had any legal protection. After he filed his report to SAFETEAM, Goldstein was fired. Subsequently, Goldstein filed suit under federal nuclear whistleblower statutes. The U.S. Department of Labor ruled that his submissions to SAFETEAM were protected and his dismissal was invalid, a finding upheld by Labor Secretary Lynn Martin. The ruling was appealed and overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that private programs offered no protection to whistleblowers. After Goldstein lost his case, Congress amended the federal nuclear whistleblower law to provide protection reports made to internal systems and prevent retaliation against whistleblowers. Fernald Nuclear Incidents Aerial view of Fernald Feed Materials Production Center Uranium components fabricated at Fernald The Fernald Feed Materials Production Center was built in Crosby Township, Ohio in 1951, and decommissioned in 1989. Fernald processed uranium trioxide and uranium tetrafluoride, among other radioactive materials, to produce the uranium fuel cores for nuclear weapons. It was shrouded in suspicion with many manager changes and the people of the town ill-informed of the purpose of the plant. The Fernald Feed Materials Production Center also conducted an evaluation of how much material was contaminated by Radium. Using 138 pieces of the CR-39 film assays, they were able to determine that people working in the area where K-65 silos ( Underground chamber used to store missiles) had lower levels of exposure of materials contaminated by Radon than the Q-11 silos between the period of 1952-1988 Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology.Throughout 1951-1995 the plant had numerous scandals including faking numbers for contamination and disregarding evidence of ground water pollution. Among the citizens affected by the pollution was Mrs. Lisa Crawford who took action. Crawford and other residents filed a lawsuit in 1985 and became president of the organization FRESH (Fernald Residents for Environmental Safety and Health). A lawsuit was then filed once again against Fernald by former employees several years later in 1990. After several years of being heavily advised not to blow the whistle, the workers earned themselves a $15 million settlement and lifelong medical monitoring. In 1992, FERMCO was hired to construct a cleanup plan for the plant and in 1996, around accusations of wasteful spending, the cleanup of ground water and soil was completed. Mordechai Vanunu Mordechai Vanunu 2009 Mordechai Vanunu blew the whistle on the nuclear plant in Dimona, Israel in an interview with The Sunday Times that was published on 5 October 1986. According to Vanunu, this plant had been producing nuclear weapons for 10 to 20 years. It is estimated that there may be around 200 nuclear weapons in possession of Israel's nuclear weapons program. Vanunu demonstrated his knowledge to Frank Barnaby and Theodore Taylor, and they confirmed the credibility of his story. Frank Barnaby wrote in his Declaration of Frank Barnaby in the Matter of Mordechai Vanunu that Vanunu had the bare minimum knowledge of nuclear physics that a technician should have and accurately described the makeup of the nuclear plant in Dimona. Having served in full his 18 years prison term, ruled in closed door trial, including 11 years in solitary Vanunu has been further in and out of jail after. In 2007, sentenced to six months for violating terms of his parole, and in May 2010, again to three months for having met foreigners in violation of his release terms from jail. Vanunu is ethnic Mizrahi Jew, born in Marrakesh Morocco, having emigrated to Israel, following its independence in 1948, like many of the North African Jewish community did. Amnesty International issued a press release on 2 July 2007, stating that \\"The organisation considers Mordechai Vanunu to be a prisoner of conscience and calls for his immediate and unconditional release.\\"[6] Vanunu has been characterized internationally as a whistleblower[7][8] and by Israel as a traitor. Despite the whistle blown towards the operation of the nuclear weapons program in Israel, the Israeli government denied the existence of all allegations. Mordechai Vanunu is known as Israel\`s Nuclear Whistleblower. Arnold Gundersen In 1990 Arnold Gundersen discovered radioactive material in an accounting safe at Nuclear Energy Services in Danbury, Connecticut, the consulting firm where he held a $120,000-a-year job as senior vice-president. Three weeks after he notified the company president of what he believed to be radiation safety violations, Gundersen was fired. According to The New York Times, for three years, Gundersen \\"was awakened by harassing phone calls in the middle of the night\\" and he \\"became concerned about his family's safety\\". Gundersen believes he was blacklisted, harassed and fired for doing what he thought was right. The New York Times reports that Gundersen's case is not uncommon, especially in the nuclear industry. Even though nuclear workers are encouraged to report potential safety hazards, those who do risk demotion and dismissal. Instead of correcting the problems, whistleblowers say, industry management and government agencies attack them as the cause of the problem. Driven out of their jobs and shunned by neighbors and co-workers, whistleblowers often turn to each other for support. The Whistleblower Support Fund is an organization that has compiled resources for whistleblowers to access if they are considering whistleblowing. It was founded by Donald Ray Soeken, who has counseled whistleblowers for 35 years. In addition, a social network to connect whistleblowers to other whistleblowers will be implemented. It will be a private discussion where whistleblowers can safely seek support. David Lochbaum In the early 1990s, nuclear engineer David Lochbaum and a colleague, Don Prevatte, identified a safety problem in a plant where they were working, but were ignored when they raised the issue with the plant manager, the utility and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). After bringing their concerns to Congress, the problem was corrected not just at the original nuclear plant but at plants across the country. Gerald W. Brown Gerald W. Brown Gerald W. Brown was the whistleblower on the Thermo-Lag scandal, as well as on silicone foam firestop issues in the US and Canada, exposing the fact that fireproofing of wiring between control rooms and reactors did not function as intended and exposing bounding and combustibility issues with organic firestops. George Galatis George Galatis was a senior nuclear engineer and whistleblower who reported safety problems at the Millstone 1 Nuclear Power Plant, relating to reactor refueling procedures, in 1996.William H. Shaw. Business Ethics 2004, pp. 267-268. The unsafe procedures meant that spent fuel rod pools at Unit 1 had the potential to boil, possibly releasing radioactive steam throughout the plant.Adam Bowles. A Cry in the Nuclear Wilderness Christianity Today, 2 October 2000. Galatis eventually took his concerns to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to find that they had \\"known about the unsafe procedures for years\\". As a result of going to the NRC, Galatis experienced \\"subtle forms of harassment, retaliation, and intimidation\\". Rainer Moormann Rainer Moormann in 2004 Rainer Moormann is a German chemist and nuclear power whistleblower. Since 1976 he has been working at the Forschungszentrum J√ºlich, doing research on safety problems with pebble bed reactors, fusion power and spallation neutron sources. In 2008 Moormann published a critical paper on the safety of pebble bed reactors, which raised attention among specialists in the field, and managed to distribute it via the media, facing considerable opposition. For doing this despite the occupational disadvantages he had to accept as a consequence, Moormann was awarded the whistleblower award of the Federation of German Scientists (VDW)Press statement of the VWD (in German), official short version in English: http://ialana.net/uploads/media/Program_Whistleblower_Award_2011.pdf, inofficial English translation of the press release: https://euzicasa.wordpress.com/2011/06/10/presentation-of-whistleblower- award-2011_via-hintergrund/ and of the German section of the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms (IALANA). Setsuo Fujiwara Setsuo Fujiwara, who used to design reactors, said he clashed with supervisors over an inspection audit he conducted in March 2009 at the Tomari nuclear plant in Japan. Fujiwara refused to approve a routine test by the plant's operator, Hokkaido Electric Power, saying the test was flawed. A week later, he was summoned by his supervisor, who ordered him to correct his written report to indicate that the test had been done properly. After Fujiwara refused, his employment contract was not renewed. \\"They told me my job was just to approve reactors, not to raise doubts about them\\", said Fujiwara, 62, who is now suing the nuclear safety organization to get rehired. In a written response to questions from The New York Times, the agency said it could not comment while the court case was under way. Along with the lawsuit Mr. Fujiwara filed against the agency he used to work for, he had gone to the Tokyo District Court to further write several complaints about how the JNES ( Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization) failed to follow the UN laws concerning how to properly inspect nuclear energy reactors. Mr. Fujiwara also submitted several documents and emails that dealt with how the reactor inspections were improperly handled by JNES even though JNES denies all allegations. [42] Walter Tamosaitis The Hanford site resulted in a number of whistleblowers during the efforts to clean the site up. Walter Tamosaitis blew the whistle on the Energy Department's plan for waste treatment at the Hanford site in 2011. Tamosaitis's concern was the possibility of explosive hydrogen gas being built up inside tanks that the company was to store the harmful chemical sludge they were trying to put into hibernation for its chemical life. Shortly after this Tamosaitis was demoted and two years later, fired which triggered his lawsuit for wrongful termination. A $4.1 million settlement was offered to Tamosaitis from AECOM on 12 August 2015. Tamosaitis has since been reinstated. Donna Busche blew the whistle resulting in her 2013 lawsuit with claims that the URS \\"retaliated against her. She was head of nuclear safety and a URS employee around the time when she expressed her concerns. Gary Brunson reported 34 safety and engineering violations after quitting in 2012. Brunson was federal engineering chief before he quit. Shelly Doss earned \\"$20,000 in emotional distress and $10,000 in callous disregard of her rights\\" as well as reinstatement in 2014. Doss was an environmental specialist at the time of her firing in 2011 working for Washington River Protection Solutions. Larry Criscione and Richard H. Perkins In 2012, Larry Criscione and Richard H. Perkins publicly accused the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission of downplaying flood risks for nuclear plants which are sited on waterways downstream from large reservoirs and dams. They are engineers with over 20 years of combined government and military service who work for the NRC. Other nuclear safety advocates have supported their complaints. John Pace and Dan Parks In 1959, John Pace was employed at the Santa Susana Field Lab, 36 miles from Los Angeles, at the time of the partial meltdown during the Sodium Reactor Experiment. According to Pace, the reactor building doors and reactor exhaust stack were opened, releasing radiation into the atmosphere. Dan Parks also worked at the Santa Susana Field Lab, as a health physicist in the 1960s, where he witnessed the burning of radioactive waste in burn pits, and frequently saw workers illegally vent radiation into the atmosphere. In 2015 they spoke out about the incident in an investigative report by NBC News. Other nuclear whistleblowers *Chuck Atkinson *Dale G.

Saunders. The character was inspired by the character of Harry Flashman in a series of historical novels written by George MacDonald Fraser, but the character of Travers did not become as successful as his British counterpart.  Overview  The character Fenwick Travers was envisaged by Saunders as the American equivalent of Harry Flashman, having been inspired by the novels written by Fraser during the 1970s onwards. Several Travers books were written during the 1990s, and despite some positive reviews from journalists, they failed to receive the fame of the Flashman novels.  The Travers novels  Each book, like the Flashman novels, is set during a particular event in American history, and follows the actions of the antihero Travers during these events that lead to his becoming an iconic American hero. Below is the name of each book and the events that the book focuses on. * Fenwick Travers and the Years of Empire: An Entertainment - The Boxer Rebellion in China (1995) * Fenwick Travers and the Forbidden Kingdom: An Entertainment - Moro Rebellion in the Philippines (1995) * Fenwick Travers and the Panama Canal: An Entertainment - Creation of the Panama Canal in 1903 (1996)  Differences between Flashman and Travers  Although being inspired by the Flashman character, Travers differs from Flashman in several important aspects: * The Flashman novels take place between the 1840s and late 1860s, whereas the Travers novels are set between the 1880s and the early 1900s * Flashman is written to appear as though he was a real person, but Saunders acknowledges that Travers is a fictional character * The Flashman novels were written in the style of a discovered set of memoirs, whereas the Travers stories are written as adventure novels. * Harry Flashman was based on a character of the same name in an earlier book, Tom Brown's School Days, by Thomas Hughes. Travers is an original character, and is not based on any other character.

His documentary, When We Were Kings depicts the iconic heavyweight boxing match: The Rumble in the Jungle between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. This film would go on to win the 1996 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and the Independent Spirit Award. Gast co- directed the 1977 documentary, The Grateful Dead Movie with guitarist Jerry Garcia. The film captured the band's October 1974, five-night performance at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. Gast also co-directed the 1983 film Hell's Angels Forever, which focused on the notorious motorcycle club Hells Angels. The Angels are believed to have learned that Gast put material in the documentary in which they didn't prefer. To this end, Gast claims that the Angels tracked him down and beat him up. Gast has also produced works on B.B. King and Celia Cruz.  Early life  A native of Jersey City, New Jersey, Gast studied dramatic arts at Columbia University, and in that same period worked on the television series High Adventure with writer and broadcaster Lowell Thomas. Gast is also known for his still photography which has appeared in such magazines as Vogue, Esquire, and Harper's Bazaar. Gast would make album covers for Fania All-Stars which would lead him to make Our Latin Thing.  Kinshasa & When We Were Kings  Leon Gast is best known for his documentary When We Were Kings, for which he won an Academy Award for Documentary Feature. The film details the boxing match known as ‚ÄúThe Rumble in the Jungle‚Äù between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. Ali defeated Foreman in the fight, for which the two split a $10 million purse. Gast was not originally supposed to film this documentary. Gast went to Kinshasa and was still a photographer who had one documentary which was on Latin music. Gast was hired to create a documentary about a three-day music festival that was happening in Kinshasa when the fight was occurring. Zaire's ruler declared the concert free-of-charge days before it was supposed to happen. This was problematic because funds for the documentary were supposed to come directly from the proceeds of the festival. Five days before the scheduled fight, Foreman acquired a bad cut above one of his eyes and the fight was pushed back six weeks. Gast turned his attention to the fight and centered the documentary on Ali. When Gast returned from Kinshasa, he had 300,000 feet of film. Initially Gast didn't have the money to finish the documentary, so he paid the bills by making documentaries on the Grateful Dead and the Hell's Angels. In 1989, Gast's former lawyer, David Sonenberg, helped Gast out by putting up almost $1 million to finish the project. The film was first featured at the 1996 Sundance Film festival. Gast won an award for the documentary and was eventually premiered at Radio City Music Hall. Gast spent close to two decades on ‚ÄúWhen We Were Kings‚Äù. This documentary was focused towards the comeback of Ali who was forced into exile after he objected to the draft during the Vietnam Draft. When We Were Kings has received strongly positive critical reaction. The documentary highlighted an important time in sports. Susan Ryan, who is a Cineaste reviewer, said ‚Äúthis entertaining documentary shows the boxer at one of the most celebrated moments in his career, dancing around the press, and preaching black pride with the same skill that he once used dancing around the ring‚Äù.\\"Leon Gast.\\" Contemporary Authors Online.

During the battle a Boer raiding force under Jan Smuts destroyed a British cavalry squadron led by Captain Sandeman, a cousin of Winston Churchill, on the Modderfontein farm. This battle is therefore also known as the Battle of Modderfontein. Background Jan Smuts After a year of guerrilla war, the Boer leaders decided to send significant raiding forces into the Cape Colony and Natal. About 1000 Boers in six commandos already operated in the Cape Colony. The Boer leaders hoped to cause an uprising in that Dutch-majority territory or at least to widen the theater of war beyond the Boer republics of Orange Free State and South African Republic. Smuts led a commando south into the Cape Colony, while Louis Botha attempted to cross into Natal. Earlier Boer raids into the Cape Colony proved unsuccessful. All had been eventually hounded out by British mounted columns and had suffered painful losses. Smuts believed he could do better. The raid During the trek south to the Orange River, Smuts' commando lost 36 men. He finally crossed into the eastern Cape at Kiba Drift on 3 September. Major General Fitzroy Hart's British force had been guarding the ford, but General Herbert Kitchener mistakenly sent them away on another mission. The Basotho attacked the Boers on 4 September near Wittenberg Mission, killing three and wounding seven with spears and ancient guns before being driven off with serious losses. On 7 September, Smuts went on a scout near Moordenaarspoort (Murderer's Gorge), near Bethulie, when they were ambushed. All three of his companions were shot by the British and Smuts barely escaped. The cold spring rains tormented both men and horses as British pursuing columns under the overall command of Major General Sir John French closed in on Smuts' raiders. On 13 September, the Boers were cornered atop the Stormberg Mountains () and escaped only when a friendly guide in the form of Hans Kleynhans appeared and led them down a precipitous route to safety. The night of 15 September nearly finished the raiders as freezing rain killed over 60 ponies and fourteen men went missing. In front of the Boers, every mountain pass was reportedly held by the British. Battle On 17 September, as Smuts' commando threaded through a gorge that opened out into the Elands River valley, a 17-year-old farmer named Jan Coetzer informed them that a British force held the pass at Elands River Poort in the next valley. Smuts commented, \\"If we don't get those horses and a supply of ammunition, we're done for\\". The British were C Squadron of the 17th Lancers. The Boers took advantage of a mist to encircle the British camp. When Smuts' vanguard ran head on into a Lancer patrol, the British hesitated to fire because many of the Boers wore captured British uniforms. The Boers immediately opened fire and attacked in front while Smuts led the remainder of his force to attack the British camp from the rear. The British party suffered further casualties at a closed gate that slowed them down. All six British officers were hit and four were killed, only Captain Sandeman, the commander, and his lieutenant Lord Vivian surviving. The 17th Lancers lost 29 killed and 41 wounded before surrendering. Boer losses were only one killed and six wounded. One Boer noted, \\"We all had fresh horses, fresh rifles, clothing, saddlery, boots and more ammunition than we could carry away, as well as supplies for every man\\". In his book Commando, Deneys Reitz, one of the Boers, recounts how George Vivian pointed out his bivouac tent and told him it would be worth his while to take a look at it. Soon, Reitz, who had been wearing a grain-bag and using an old Mauser rifle with only two rounds of ammunition left, was dressed in a cavalry tunic and riding breeches and armed with a Lee-Metford sporting rifle. Reitz reports that he met Lord Vivian in London in 1935, on excellent terms. (Thomas Pakenham reports a more elaborate story. In this touching account, Lord Vivian overcame Reitz's reluctance to take the spoils of victory, and presented Reitz's original rifle to him in London in 1943. As Vivian died in 1940 this is impossible.) The Boers destroyed a field gun that they captured, while two maxim guns were dumped in a dam after they proved to be too much trouble. Aftermath Smuts and some 250 men of his commando were able to operate for many months in the Cape Colony, but could not win the war. By this time, the Dutch in the Cape Colony were mostly convinced that the Boer republics were losing the war. Though the commando received generous help from Dutch civilians, and indeed commandeered their requirements from people of every background, the British refrained from burning Dutch farms in the Cape Colony as a matter of policy. While Boers captured in the republics were well-treated as prisoners of war, Boer fighters native to the Cape Colony and captured there were sometimes treated as rebellious subjects and executed by the British. During the campaign, Smuts' commando, replaced worn out cloths with pieces of British khaki uniforms, and Lord Kitchener gave orders that all Boer fighters taken in British uniform were to be executed. Several members of the commando were shot on this basis, others for being treasonous subjects of the Cape Colony. When the remaining members found out about this order, they dressed themselves in civilian clothes as soon as they could.

Nauru is an island country in Micronesia, a subregion of Oceania, in the Central Pacific. These attacks were conducted by auxiliary cruisers between 6 and 8 December and on 27 December. The raiders sank five Allied merchant ships and inflicted serious damage on Nauru's economically important phosphate- loading facilities. Despite the significance of the island to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru was not defended and the German force did not suffer any losses. The two attacks were the most effective operations conducted by German raiders in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. They disrupted supplies of phosphate to Australia, New Zealand and Japan, which reduced agricultural production in these countries. In response, Allied naval vessels were deployed to protect Nauru and nearby Ocean Island and escort shipping in the South Pacific. Small garrisons were also established to protect the two islands. Background Nauru and nearby Ocean Island were important sources of phosphate for Australian and New Zealand fertilizer production and played an important role on both countries agriculture industries at the time of World War II. The Melbourne-based British Phosphate Commission (BPC) managed the extraction and export of phosphate from the islands and dominated all aspects of Nauruan life.Pretes (2003), pp. 24‚Äì25 During the year ending 30 June 1940, the BPC shipped almost a million tons of phosphate from Nauru and about half that amount from Ocean Island using its fleet of four vessels (Triadic, Triaster, Triona and Trienza) and chartered merchant ships.Gill (1957), pp. 276‚Äì277 As the islands have no harbours or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods‚Äîwhich are common from November to March‚Äîthe ships had to stop loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was common for these ships to be allowed to drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.Gill (1957), p. 277 Despite their importance to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru and Ocean islands had been allocated a low priority for the limited military assets which were available to protect the Australia Station and both islands were undefended in December 1940. Strategic stockpiles of phosphate had been built up in Australia, however, to lessen the impact of an attack on the islands.Gill (1957), p. 283 In late October 1940, the German raider , which was commanded by Captain Kurt Weyher met , which came under the command of Captain Robert Eyssen, and the supply ship Kulmerland at Lamotrek in the Caroline Islands. Eyssen was the more senior of the two captains, and assumed overall command of the force.Gill (1957), p. 280 The three ships operated off New Zealand's east coast for 18 days during November and sank the small coaster Holmwood and large ocean liner with gunfire without being detected by the weak New Zealand defences on 25 and 27 November respectively.Jackson (1998), p. 94 Following these attacks, the raiders proceeded to the Kermadec Islands where they transferred their women and children prisoners to Kulmerland on 29 November. The three ships then proceeded to Nauru to attack the island's phosphate industry and the concentration of shipping which the German captains knew was usually present. Attacks on Nauru Movements of the three German ships in December 1940 and January 1941 The German force encountered its first BPC ship while en route to Nauru. On 6 December, Triona () was attacked north-east of the Solomon Islands and was sunk with torpedoes after a chase in which three of her crew were killed by the raiders' guns. All 68 survivors were captured. The raider captains intended to land a shore party and bombard Nauru's shore installations at dawn on 8 December, but bad weather forced them to concentrate on the ships which were off the island. On the evening of 7 December, Komet‚Äîwhich had gone ahead to reconnoitre and was disguised as the Japanese merchant ship Manyo Maru‚Äîsank the Norwegian merchant ship Vinni () approximately south of Nauru. While the raider was spotted from the shore, her disguise was successful and she was assumed to be a merchant ship bound for Japan.Gill (1957), p. 281 Orion joined Komet off Nauru in the early hours of 8 December, and attacked and damaged Triadic () and sank Triaster (). Komet then tried to sink Triadic with scuttling charges, but this was unsuccessful and Orion sank the merchant ship with gunfire. Komet later sank the British steamer Komata (). Following these attacks, the two raiders and Kulmerland withdrew and assembled east of Nauru. As the weather precluded a landing on the island, it was decided that Komet and Kulmerland would go to Ailinglaplap in the Marshall Islands, where Komet would refuel while Orion operated north- west of Nauru. Following this, the ships would meet off the island and make another attempt to land a raiding party. The German attacks on Nauru on 7‚Äì8 December and 27 December 1940. When the German force reassembled off Nauru on 15 December, the weather continued to be too bad to permit a landing and the attack on Nauru was broken off. Further attacks on shipping were judged impractical, as the raiders had intercepted radio messages ordering vessels bound for Nauru and Ocean Island to disperse. Instead, the three German ships proceeded to the Australian-administered island of Emirau to disembark the 675 prisoners they were carrying. While Weyher refused to release any of the European ethnic prisoners on board Orion, as he believed that \\"trained officers and crews are as much a problem for Britain as shipping itself\\", the ships landed 343 Europeans and 171 Chinese and South Pacific-ethnic people.Waters (1956), p. 145 Fortunately for the Germans, Emirau was one of the few islands in the region to not have a Royal Australian Navy-supplied radio to contact the Australian authorities.Jackson (1998), p. 95 The two European families on the island provided the released prisoners with supplies, and sent a canoe to Kavieng in New Ireland to notify the Australian colonial government. A schooner was dispatched to bring additional supplies to Emirau, and arrived there on 24 December. The colonial administrator of New Britain and further supplies was also flown to Emirau on board a flying boat. The released prisoners were embarked onto the steamer Nellore on 29 December to be transported to Townsville in Queensland, where they arrived on 1 January 1941. They provided useful intelligence on the German raiders' operations, and the German Naval Staff issued a directive on 19 February 1941 prohibiting raiders from releasing further prisoners.Waters (1956), pp. 145‚Äì146 The three German ships parted company after leaving Emirau on 21 December. Orion proceeded to Lamutrik and then Maug in the Mariana Islands to overhaul her engines, Kulmerland went to Japan, and only Komet continued operations in the South Pacific. She attempted to lay mines off Rabaul on 24 December using her motor boat, but this project was abandoned when the boat's engines failed. Komet returned to Nauru following the unsuccessful attempt to mine Rabaul, and arrived off the island at 05:45 on the morning of 27 December. After issuing a warning for those on shore to not use radio and signalling her intent to destroy the phosphate loading plant, she opened fire at 06:40. The bombardment lasted for about an hour, during which time the raider wrecked the loading plant, oil tanks, boats, buildings and mooring buoys. Following this attack, she sailed to the south-east and Nauru broadcast news of the attack to Australia. This was the last visit of German ships to Nauru during the war, and Komet transferred her activities to the Indian Ocean.Gill (1957), p. 282 Aftermath HMAS Manoora off Nauru in January 1941 The German raids on Nauru affected the Australian and New Zealand economies and were the greatest success achieved by German raiders in the Pacific Ocean during World War II.Waters (1956), pp. 147‚Äì148 It took ten weeks to resume phosphate shipments from Nauru, and the loss of ships and damaged infrastructure led to a significant decline in output. The resulting phosphate shortages forced the introduction of fertilizer rationing in New Zealand from July 1941. Komets bombardment of the island also interfered with phosphate consignments to Japan, which caused the Japanese government to threaten to reduce the aid it was providing to Germany. The success of the attacks on Nauru led to rumours in Australia and New Zealand that the raiders had been aided by treachery in the islands. Several investigations were conducted into the rumours and proved them to be unfounded. Following the raids, the Commonwealth military forces in the Pacific took steps to prevent further attacks by raiders. The Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force flew an increased number of patrols in search of raiders operating near major ports.Forczyk (2010), p. 62 In addition, the Australian Naval Board requested that the British Admiralty authorise the redeployment of Australian naval units to meet the threat posed by raiders. This was agreed to, and the light cruiser and armed merchant cruiser returned to Australia from other stations. This allowed naval protection to be provided to Nauru and Ocean islands, and the armed merchant cruiser arrived off Ocean Island on 4 January 1941 escorting Trienza.

The attacks also led to the introduction of convoys between Australia and New Zealand.Gill (1957), p. 284 The naval authorities were able to use the intelligence they gained from the prisoners landed at Emirau to re-route merchant ships away from the areas in which the German raiders were operating; this greatly reduced the effectiveness of the raiders, and Komet and Orion only sank three ships in the period between the attack on Nauru and their return to Europe in late 1941.

It is useful as a method in fluid mechanics to compare true velocities, such as the velocity of a flow in a stream, to a velocity that relates shear between layers of flow. Shear velocity is used to describe shear-related motion in moving fluids. It is used to describe: * Diffusion and dispersion of particles, tracers, and contaminants in fluid flows * The velocity profile near the boundary of a flow (see Law of the wall) * Transport of sediment in a channel Shear velocity also helps in thinking about the rate of shear and dispersion in a flow. Shear velocity scales well to rates of dispersion and bedload sediment transport. A general rule is that the shear velocity is between 5% to 10% of the mean flow velocity. For river base case, the shear velocity can be calculated by Manning's equation. :u^*=langle uranglefrac{n}{a}(gR_h^{-1/3})^{0.5} * n is the Gauckler‚ÄìManning coefficient. Units for values of n are often left off, however it is not dimensionless, having units of: (T/[L1/3]; s/[ft1/3]; s/[m1/3]). * Rh is the hydraulic radius (L; ft, m); * the role of a is a dimension correction factor. Thus a= 1 m1/3/s = 1.49 ft1/3/s. Instead of finding n and R_h for your specific river of interest, you can examine the range of possible values and note that for most rivers, u^* is between 5% and 10% of langle urangle: For general case :u_{star}=sqrt{frac{tau}{rho}} where œÑ is the shear stress in an arbitrary layer of fluid and œÅ is the density of the fluid. Typically, for sediment transport applications, the shear velocity is evaluated at the lower boundary of an open channel: :u_{star}=sqrt{frac{tau_b}{rho}} where œÑb is the shear stress given at the boundary. Shear velocity can also be defined in terms of the local velocity and shear stress fields (as opposed to whole-channel values, as given above). Friction Velocity in Turbulence The friction velocity is often used as a scaling parameter for the fluctuating component of velocity in turbulent flows. One method of obtaining the shear velocity is through non- dimensionalization of the turbulent equations of motion. For example, in a fully developed turbulent channel flow or turbulent boundary layer, the streamwise momentum equation in the very near wall region reduces to: : 0={ u}{partial^2 overline{u}over partial y^2}-frac{partial}{partial y}(overline{u'v'}) . By integrating in the y-direction once, then non- dimensionalizing with an unknown velocity scale u‚àó and viscous length scale , the equation reduces down to: : frac{tau_w}{rho} = ufrac{partial u}{partial y} - overline{u'v'} or : frac{tau_w}{rho u_{star}^2} = frac{partial u^+}{partial y^+} + overline{tau_T^+}. Since the right hand side is in non-dimensional variables, they must be of order 1. This results in the left hand side also being of order one, which in turn give us a velocity scale for the turbulent fluctuations (as seen above): :u_{star} = sqrt{frac{tau_w}{rho}}. Here, œÑw refers to the local shear stress at the wall. Planetary boundary layer Within the lowest portion of the planetary boundary layer a semi-empirical log wind profile is commonly used to describe the vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind speeds. The simplified equation that describe it is u(z) = frac{u_*}{kappa} left[ln left(frac{z-d}{z_0} right)right] where kappa is the Von K√°rm√°n constant (~0.41), d is the zero plane displacement (in metres). The zero-plane displacement (d) is the height in meters above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings. It can be approximated as 2/3 to 3/4 of the average height of the obstacles.Holmes JD. Wind Loading of Structures. 3rd ed. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press; 2015. For example, if estimating winds over a forest canopy of height 30 m, the zero-plane displacement could be estimated as d = 20 m. Thus, you can extract the friction velocity by knowing the wind velocity at two levels (z). u_* = frac{kappa(u(z2)-u(z1))}{ln left(frac{z2-d}{z1-d} right)} References * Fluid mechanics Geophysics Geomorphology Sedimentology ","title":"Shear velocity"},{"id":"19111857","text":"The T140W TSS was the last motorcycle model made by Triumph Engineering at their Meriden factory.  Development history  Designed to appeal to the US market, the TSS had an eight valve Weslake Engineering cylinder head developed by Triumph's Brian Jones from a 1978/9 design originally commissioned from Nourish Racing of RutlandA Final Bid To Triumph Classic Bike (April 2012( following 1960s designs for the 650cc twins by the Rickman Brothers. The crank was a fully machined single forging with increased big end diameter making it much stiffer and better-balanced and producing one of the smoothest running motorcycles in the Triumph range. The head had smaller valves set at a steeper angle (30¬∞). Recesses in the pistons allowed a 10:1 compression ratio. UK models had a pair of 34 mm Amal MkII carburetors while the export models had Bing constant velocity carburetors. Other changes from the standard T140E included offset connecting rods, steel-linered alloy barrels, a strengthened swinging arm, and a high output three-phase alternator. A modified TSS raced by Jon Minonno for Texan Jack Wilson's Big D Triumph dealership achieved outstanding results in the Battle of the Twins races for 1981-1982.The Empire Strikes Back(Bike 8/82) According to the Triumph build books, held by the Vintage Motor Cycle Club, the first TSS was built on 27 October 1981 for the North American market.  Specification  1982 UK/RoW specification Triumph TSS at the London Motorcycle Museum sporting the Morris alloy wheel option but also owner-fitted with some non-standard 1979 parts: Girling rear shock absorbers, handlebar levers and a grabrail with parcel carrier Launched in 1982 with an electric starter as standard, the all-new top end of the engine featured Cooper rings sealing the 8-valve cylinder head to the barrel. American Morris alloy wheels were an option with dual Automotive Products Lockheed disc brakes upfront as standard. The fins of the black painted engine were polished although, like the Triumph TR65 Thunderbird, many alloy cycle parts that had in the past been bright‚Äìpolished or chromed were now painted satin black. Mudguards were stainless steel as were the Italian Radaelli rims for the wire-spoked wheel option. The high specification air-oil 'Strada' rear suspension units were supplied by Italian firm Marzocchi. Like the Italian‚Äìsourced petrol tank, other OEM components were now from mainland Europe: French Veglia clocks, Italian Paioli petrol taps and German Bumm mirrors, Magura choke lever and ULO direction indicators.Eight into Two Makes Power ! (Classic Bike 7/82)Fast And Varicose (Motorcycling 7/82) Unlike most Triumph models, no USA style with high handlebars and two-gallon tank was produced, all models coming with the Italian four-gallon tank and low handlebars as well as the newly introduced alloy 'dog leg' clutch and front brake levers. The actual version exported to the USA received a black paint scheme with gold-lined red 'wings' along with newly shaped megaphone mufflers and German Bing carburettors.Triumph TSS-The Legend Reborn (Rider 2/83) A one- off variant in line with the Triumph Bonneville T140EX Executive was produced for a London dealer, albeit again in gold-lined black, but with the Executive's standard Brealey-Smith 'Sabre' fairing and luggage by Sigma.Re- Writing History (Classic Bike Guide 12/93) All TSS were shod with Avon Roadrunner tyres. Only 112 TSS bikes were actually exported by Triumph, as on 26 August 1983 the factory at Meriden went into voluntary liquidation. It is calculated that 438 TSS units were made in total. The TSS, particularly the engine, was generally well received by the British and international pressDate with the Eight (Motor Cycle News 3.03.82)Britisches Reitpferd (PS 5/83)Renovierung (Motorrad 18.8.82)Gestern Heute (Motorrad 26/1982)TSS:More Notes on the Trumpet(Bike 8/82)Triumph TSS: Quick Teaser (Bike Australia no.11 Vol.1 02.83) although a long term test by Motor Cycle Weekly revealed early cylinder heads to be porous and wet weather braking failure.Triumphing Against The Odds ! (Motor Cycle Weekly 8.01.83) In an interview in US magazine, Motorcyclist, Meriden's Director of Engineering, Brian Jones revealed that the epoxy coating on the initial cylinder heads supplied by Weslake disguised the porosity problem from their factory testers.Triumph:End of the Road?(Motorcyclist 6/83)  TSSAV  Fitting an eight-valve engine in an anti- vibration frame was first mooted by the factory at the 1981 Earls Court motorcycle show on the prototype super-tourer, TS8-1. Now displayed at the London Motorcycle Museum, the TS8-1 had plastic bodywork by Ian Dyson of contracted stylists, Plastic Fantastic.After Eight ?(Which Bike ? 2/81) For the unrealised 1984 range, the TSS was to have had Meriden's 'Enforcer' anti- vibration frame as standard where the engine was rubber-mounted in a special anti-vibration frame. Styling changes included the adoption of parts from the Triumph T140 TSX model such as the abbreviated rear mudguard albeit in stainless steel and side panels with a TSX-styled TSS badge affixed. These replaced the original side panels which had been extended to cover the Bing carburettor linkages on the USA export models. A plastic 'ducktail' seat unit was mounted above the shortened rear mudguard of the projected 1984 civilian model and rear set footrests, brake and gear shift mechanisms fitted. Police TSS AV retained the standard footrest/control arrangement as well as conventional cycle parts over the ducktail and TSX parts. Due to the height clearance limitations caused by the engine jogging about its rubber mounts within the Enforcer frame, the shorter Amal Mk2 carburettors instead of Bings were fitted.Guide Lines (Cycle Guide 6/83) TSS-AV close up Only three examples of the TSS AV in police and civilian specification were ever madeMr Smoothy (British Bike Magazine 6/92)(and one bare frame) including one for the late Chris Buckle, proprietor of former Triumph dealers, Roebucks Motorcycles. Not quite to the envisaged 1984 specification, this was made on 27 June 1983 and is, according to the factory production records held by the Vintage Motor Cycle Club, the last complete Meriden Triumph.Meriden's Last Twin For Sale(Classic Bike 4/90) This is the pictured burgundy-coloured example now on display at the National Motorcycle Museum in Solihull, West Midlands close to the former factory site. It was factory -fitted with Koni rear suspension units and omitted the 'ducktail' in favour of the conventional rear mudguard arrangement.  TSX8  Another prototype from the unrealised 1984 range, a TSS engine, with Bings, in Triumph T140 TSX cycle parts was to be marketed as the TSX8, the original four-valve version renamed as the TSX4. Wayne Moulton who designed the TSX, had originally done so with the 8-valve TSS engine in mind.

Terrorism Threat of Islamic terrorism is a matter of concern. Watching a Saudi Succession The New York Times Saudi Arabia has seen many terrorist attacks on its soil. In 1996, Khobar Towers bombing and a number people inside the building were killed. Various Iranian groups have also tried to wreck havoc in Saudi Arabia. During the 9/11 plane crashes, it was revealed that most of the terrorists were from Saudi Arabia. https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches- testimony/2002/DCI_18_June_testimony_new.pdfFrom 2000 to 2004, when a number of expatriate workers were killed in car bombings, questions arose over the seriousness and sincerity of Saudi efforts to prevent or investigate attacks. Before May 2003, the only public statements of any investigation or prosecution of attacks were Saudi accusations against the (mainly British) western expatriates themselves. Saudis arrested and detained several, claiming they were 'alcohol traders' fighting a turf war over the illegal distribution of alcohol. According to author Thomas Hegghammer, \\"today, few outside Saudi Arabia believe that alcohol traders carried out the bombings\\", as the suspects were well-paid professionals with no prior record of violent crime, no forensic evidence was provided against them, and attacks of a very similar nature on western nationals continued despite the arrests of the alleged perpetrators. After 26 foreigners were killed in a May 2003 attack by three car bombs on foreign residential compounds in Riyadh, American intelligence sources quoted by the Daily Telegraph, stated the operation \\"depended on a significant level of \`insider\` knowledge of the compounds,\\" and this and other evidence indicates that al-Qaeda has infiltrated even the elite National Guard, which was involved in compound security. Bombers wore uniforms of security forces, in both the May 2003 compound bombing and another in November. In May 2004, militants took dozens of hostages attacking three buildings in the oil-industry town of Khobar over a 25-hour period killing 22 and injuring 25 ‚Äîmainly foreign workers ‚Äî killing one victim by tying him to the back of a vehicle and dragged through the street.

Fitzgerald, Praeger, 2007, \\"Saudis storm besieged compound\\" on CNN, 30 May 2004 While attacks by militants have decreased dramatically since late 2004, there are continued reports of terrorist planning. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of the Government of Australia claimed they received reports that terrorists are masterminding attacks against assets belonging to the Government of Saudi Arabia, oil infrastructure, aviation infrastructure, embassies, hotels, shopping malls and many Western interests such as residential housing complexes, gatherings of foreign tourists for recreational or cultural activities etc. The United States Department of State reported \\"There is an on-going security threat due to the continued presence of terrorist groups, some affiliated with al Qaida, who may target Western interests, housing compounds, and other facilities where Westerners congregate\\".Saudi Arabia United States Department of State Terrorist attacks in the country targeted both native people and foreigners. DFAT further stated \\"Terrorist attacks could occur at any time, anywhere in Saudi Arabia, including in Riyadh, Khobar, and other major cities\\". The kingdom has taken successful efforts to rehabilitate terrorists. Saudi Arabia has the best terrorist rehabilitation program in the world. Their terrorist recidivism rate is about 3 to 4%. In order to have such a low terrorist recidivism rate, the Saudi Arabian‚Äôs well-designed strategies to counter the effects new terrorist recruits endure during indoctrination to a terrorist organization. The effects that Saudi Arabia terrorist rehabilitation program targets are as follows: authorization, isolation, training, and dehumanization. By knowing these steps, the rehabilitation programs reverse the effects of the terrorist authorization, isolation, dehumanization, and training to become successful in criminal rehabilitation. The rehabilitation programs help violent offenders positively reintegrate in the free society by supporting the creation of positive peer and familial relationships. These programs help to reconnect family with the offender or aid in the creation of a family.Lankford, Adam & Gillespie, Katherine. (2011). Rehabilitating Terrorists Through Counter- Indoctrination: Lessons Learned From The Saudi Arabian Program. International Criminal Justice Review. 21. 118-133. Murder In 1988, the \\"reported\\" murder rate in Saudi Arabia was .011 per 100,000 population, sexual offenses were .059 per 100,000 population, and thefts were .005 per 100,000. In 2002, a total of 599 crimes were reported in Saudi Arabia, or .06 crimes for every 100,000 people. By 2006 those numbers had gone down with murder at .010 per 100,000 population, sexual offenses at .046 per 100,000, and thefts offenses at .04 per 100,000. In 2015, the UN office of drugs and crime reported the murder rate in Saudi Arabia to be 1.5 per 100,000, with 472 recorded offences.https://data.unodc.org/#state:1 Sharia law The Saudi legal system is based on Sharia or Islamic law and thus often prohibits many activities that are not crimes in other nations, such as alcohol or pork consumption, public displays of non-Islamic religious symbols or text, affection between opposite sex outside of marriage, \\"indecent\\" artwork or media images, sorcery, homosexuality, cross-dressing, and fornication or adultery. Although some Western countries and human rights advocates criticize the Saudi corrections system for the manner in which offenders are punished, in fact many such punishments originally come from Islam and are applied regardless of religion to anyone who commits crime. The article \\"Islamic Law Across Cultural Borders: The Involvement of Western Nationals in Saudi Murder Trials\\" by Esmaeili & Gans (2000), discussed several important points regarding the three major types of punishments established under Sharia law. These three are \\"Hudud\\" (limit or boundary), \\"Qisas\\" \\"retaliation\\", and \\"Tazirat\\" \\"discretionary punishments\\" (Esmaeili & Gans, 2000, p. 153). These punishments \\"are fixed by the Quran and Sunnah and cannot be altered by any judicial authority\\" (Esmaeili & Gans, 2000, p. 153). The first punishment called Hudud (limit or boundary) includes life imprisonment, lashing, stoning to death for those who have illegal sexual intercourse, and hand amputation for thefts, depending on the particular culpable circumstances (Esmaeili & Gans, 2000). Despite its potential for harshness, punishment through Hudud is imposed incrementally and under community supervision. The second punishment called Qisas (retaliation) is reserved for crimes of violence such as murder and assault. Esmaeili and Gans (2000) stated that \\"the courts have no initial sentencing role\\" because Qisas follows an eye-for-an-eye justice of retaliation, meaning that \\"the offender is punished in the same way, and by the same means, as the crime that she or he committed\\" (p. 153). Thus the penalty for murder is death and for assault is a beating. The third punishment is called Tazirat (discretionary punishments) and it depends on the severity of the crime (Esmaeili & Gans, 2000). In this category the King‚Äôs approval is not required as in the previous categories. So, if a person commits any sin which violates Islamic law, the judge can punish him or her. Practicing Tazirat includes punishments such as \\"lashing, prison, or banishment, is specified in written form\\" (Esmaeili & Gans, 2000, p. 153).

Richardson Historic District of North Easton is a National Historic Landmark District in the village of North Easton in Easton, Massachusetts. It consists of five buildings designed by noted 19th-century architect Henry Hobson Richardson, and The Rockery, a war memorial designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. and The landmark district is contained within the larger North Easton Historic District which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 3, 1972. It also contains the Old Colony Railroad Station which was individually listed on the NRHP on April 11, 1972. History Easton was first settled in 1694 and was officially incorporated in 1725. In 1694, the first settler, Clement Briggs established his home near the Easton Green. In 1711, the Taunton North Purchase area became Norton, and in 1713, the twenty- six families settled in Easton and hired Elder William Pratt as their first minister. There was no legal parish in Easton until 1722 when the East Precinct of Norton was recognized. In 1725, the area was incorporated as the Town of Easton; it was so named because it was formerly called the \\"East End\\" of the Taunton North Purchase and was shortened by pronunciation to Easton. In 1803, the Ames Shovel Company was established and became nationally known as having provided the shovels which laid the Union Pacific Railroad and opened the west. In 1875, the shovel production of the Ames plant was worth 1.5 million. The most notable of the Ames family were Oakes Ames, a key figure in the Cr√©dit Mobilier of America scandal, and Oliver Ames, governor of Massachusetts from 1887‚Äì1890. The Ames family shaped the town's economy, and was responsible for the presence of a number of landmark buildings in the town designed by H. H. Richardson, originator of the Richardsonian Romanesque style and designer of Trinity Church in Boston. The five Richardson buildings in the Historic Landmark District include: *Ames Free Library *Oakes Ames Memorial Hall *Old Colony Railroad Station (houses the Easton Historical Society; original NRHP designation, April 1972) *Ames Gate Lodge (located on Elm Street; privately owned by the Ames family) *F. L. Ames Gardener's Cottage Other associated buildings Though this school complex was not made by Richardson himself, it was dedicated to him and made in his style: *H. H. Richardson/F. L. Olmsted Intermediate School Although intended to be the town hall, the Oakes Ames Memorial Hall was never accepted by the town and never used for that purpose. In addition, there is a commercial building at 66 Main Street which was designed and built in the nineteenth century by Richardson's office in a Richardsonian style. The Richardson buildings are all located within a compact area designated as the H. H. Richardson Historic District. The area also includes The Rockery, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, who also landscaped grounds of Oakes Ames Memorial Hall and the Ames Free Library.

R. Simms. A single prototype was ordered by the British Army in April 1899, a few months before the Second Boer War broke out. It was built by Vickers, Sons & Maxim of Barrow on a special Coventry-built Daimler chassis and had a German-built Daimler engine. Because of difficulties that arose, including a gearbox destroyed by a road accident, Vickers did not deliver the prototype until 1902, and by then the South African wars were over. The vehicle was an improvement over Simms's earlier design, known as the Motor Scout, which was the first armed (but not armoured) vehicle powered by a petrol engine. The vehicle had Vickers armour 6 mm thick and was powered by a four-cylinder 3.3-litre 16 Horsepower Cannstatt Daimler engine, giving it a maximum speed of around 9 miles per hour (14.5 km/h). The armament, consisting of two Maxim guns, was carried in two turrets with 360¬∞ traverse. Some sources also mention a single QF 1 pounder pom-pom. Fully equipped, the vehicle had a length of overall, with a beam of , a ram at each end, two turrets, and two guns. It was \\"capable of running on very rough surfaces\\". It was designed to be operated by a crew of four men.

Innes was a commandant at the Port Macquarie penal settlement from November 1826 to April 1827. He then spent time in Sydney as brigade major before becoming a superintendent of police and magistrate at Parramatta, until 1829. Captain Innes returned in 1830 and settled on his grant of 2,568 acres (1,039 ha) of land near Port Macquarie where the 22-room Lake Innes house was built, using convict labour, in several stages between 1831 and 1843.

In 1536 he began his military career. In 1548 he was in Granada and in 1550 he embarked to the Indies with his brother Alonso de Zurita. In 1553 went on to the kingdom of Peru. At the beginning of 1557, by order of the Viceroy Hurtado de Mendoza he was sent with an expedition of 700 soldiers under the command of his son Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza, to Chile. From there by order of the new Governor Mendoza, he was sent with a command of 70 men with the position of Lieutenant Governor and Greater Justice for the province of Tucuman, Juries and Diaguitas. He crossed the Andes Mountains and arrived at Santiago del Estero in May 1558.  Biography  Zurita relieved Juan Gregorio Baz√°n the chief of the few soldiers or colonists who remained in the province, that was torn by discord and afflicted by crime continuing a precarious existence after the departure of the previous governor. With a new immigration from Chile and Peru, Zurita at the head of the government was able to bring the settlers a larger measure of prosperity than they had previously enjoyed and treated all parties with equal justice. In honour of the union of Philip II and Queen Mary, Zurita changed the name of the province to Nueva Inglaterra (New England). He also founded three towns: Londres, Canete, and Cordova. Zurita continued the task of subjugating the Diaguita and Calchaqu√≠ Indians with some success. When Diego L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga y Velasco, arrived in Peru as the new Viceroy in 1560, he was determined to make the province of Tucuman independent, except as subordinated to the viceroy of Peru. This proposed change provoked a revolt on the part of those who wished to maintain the connection with Chile. Londres inhabitants led this movement, reinforced by the garrison of the town, who went over to them. The uprising was suppressed, but opposition aroused by Zurita finally persuaded the Governor of Chile that it was desirable to transfer the affairs of the province of Tucuman to other hands. Gregorio Casta√±eda was, therefore, sent to supersede Zurita. Zurita was transferred, against his will, back to Chile, but rendered service to the governors Don Pedro de Villagra and don Rodrigo de Quiroga in the Arauco War. At first he underestimated the Mapuche and his column of reinforcements from Angol for Concepcion was ambushed by Millalelmo and 3000 Mapuche at the Andali√©n River in 1564. He managed to escape annihilation and get back to Santiago, Chile. Following the Mapuche's failed Siege of Concepcion he joined Governor Villagra in the Second Battle of Reinohuel√©n and Battle of Tulmill√°n ending the revolt of the Mapuche north of the B√≠o B√≠o River.  Family  In 1571, the Viceroy of Peru, Don Francisco de Toledo, gave permission for him to found two settlements in the government of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. He was married with Jer√≥nima de Mena y Salda√±a. He died in La Plata in the year 1595.

The main temple has also the statue of Shiva, considered as swami of Taxaka.  Mythological legend  There is puranic mythological legend heard about nagaraja Taxaka and Dhanavantari in this part of Malwa region in Madhya Pradesh. Emperor Janamejaya ascended to the throne of Hastinapura upon the death of his father Parikshit. According to legend, Parikshit, the lone descendant of the House of Pandu, had died of snakebite. He had been cursed by a sage to die so, the curse having been consummated by the serpent-chieftain Takshak. Janamejaya bore a deep grudge against the serpents for this act, and thus decided to wipe them out altogether. He attempted this by performing a great Sarpa satra - a sacrifice at Nagda that would destroy all living serpents. All the nagas had been destroyed in this nagayagya except Taxaka, who is believed to have obtained boon from Lord Vishnu. Local tradition goes that Taxaka resides here in this place. On the other hand Dhanavantari along with his followers and medicines was going to save Parikshit. The Taxaka naga with the help of illusive powers took the form of wood-stick of chandan tree. When Dhanavantari took this wood-stick on his shoulder, the Taxaka bite him on back and Dhanvantari died. The local people believe that Dhanvantari stays here since that time as god of herbs and medicines. The local vaidyas first worship Dhanavantari here and then collect medicinal herbs for treatment.

The Manor of Ipsley was held by the Huband family from Norman times. The house, originally comprising a central block and two wings to the north and south, was built for Sir John Huband Kt in the 16th century. The estate was sold in 1724, following the death of Sir John Huband Bt.. The new owner, the Rector Rev. John Dobson demolished the central block leaving two unconnected wings. The south wing was used residentially, the north was converted to a stable block. In the mid 18th century the property passed to Samuel Savage, whose nephew Walter Savage Landor later restored the buildings and added an apselike structure to the south wing. The property was much altered and modernised when it was converted to commercial use in the 20th century. For many years it was occupied by The Law Society, and now is occupied by the head office of Knights Pharmacy, a regional chain of pharmacies.

It took place at the recorded time of 04:05 (05:05 hrs ) hours, on the May the 19th, 1953 in Yucca Flat, in the Nevada Test Site. The sponsor of the test was the National Laboratory of the United States of America located at Los Alamos. Device The test device, codenamed Hamlet, was detonated atop a 300-foot tower, the device produced a yield of 32 kilotonnes. The device had a diameter of 56 inches and a length of 66 inches. Its weight was 4 tonnes. The device was designed by Ted Taylor at the Los Alamos National Laboratory of the United States of America, and is distinguished from all others because it was the most efficient pure fission design with a yield below 100 kt ever tested. The design utilized a new hollow core concept.Newsletter published and written by the (United States of America) National Association of Atomic Veterans, Inc. (ed. R.J.Ritter) Retrieved 2015-11-28 (c.f. Atomic veteran) The concept was termed as \\"radical implosion system\\" aiming towards reducing the amount of fissionable materials present in the weapon's core while generating moderately high yield. Detonation A picture taken about a hundredth of a second after ignition. The device was detonated in Area 3 of the test site. Deposition Of the Upshot‚ÄìKnothole tests, the so-called Harry test deposited the 3rd highest amount of Caesium-137, Niobium-95, Strontium-90, Zirconium-95, the fourth highest deposit for Niobium-95m, Praseodymium-144, fifth for Uranium-240, Ruthenium-106, sixth for Iodine-131, Tellurium-127m, eighth for deposition of Cobalt-60, tenth for deposition of Europium-155, thirteenth for Strontium-89, Yttrium-90, and sixteenth for Beryllium-7, (the source lists Sr-90 twice, at 3rd and thirteenth, thirteenth was omitted here). The deposition pattern was most similar to test name CLIMAX. Monitoring personnel including United States of America Atomic Energy Commission personnel monitored the resultant radioactive fallout in areas including St.George, Utah. Fallout from the test fell on 3046 counties of the United States. Due to a miscalculation and change in wind-direction, this Upshot‚ÄìKnothole test released an unusually large amount of fallout (the highest of any test in the continental U.S.), much of which later accumulated in the vicinity of St. George, Utah. Because of this, the shot would become known as \\"Dirty Harry\\" in the press when details were released publicly. It would be among the most controversial of the U.S. nuclear weapon tests. Two years after the blast, Howard Hughes filmed the motion picture The Conqueror near St. George. The cast and crew totaled 220 people. By the end of 1980, as ascertained by People magazine, 91 of them had developed some form of cancer and 46 had died of the disease, including the main stars John Wayne and Susan Hayward.

He was also the first to describe the contact and wear of the approximal side of the teeth. He continued to develop the cohesive gold fillings. His eldest son, Ott√≥ Zsigmondy, was also a dentist. His more limited professional field of research was the preserving dentistry. He used sodium-superoxide for widening the root canal and he made permanent fillings of black hard gutta percha. On the basis of observations carried out on himself he described the two-phase or temporal mastication called after him. He was also much engaged with professional politics, in his publications he strove for recognition of dentistry as an organic part of medical science.

In 1971, selected trips were extended through Southwest Baltimore along a route similar to today's Route 16. This service operated to Brooklyn, serving Rosemont, Lutheran Hospital, and the corridor of Hilton Street, Caton Avenue, and Patapsco Avenue. In 1975, Route 22 was modified to absorb parts of Routes 34 and 57. In January 2001, service between Mondawmin and Brooklyn was split into a separate line identified as Route 16 in order to simplify an improve the reliability of service.MTA January 2001 schedule changes The frequency of Route 16 would be increased later during the decade.

The line currently runs from Towson to Fox Ridge, serving Parkville, Overlea, Rosedale, and Essex, and the Essex campus of the Community College of Baltimore County (formerly Essex Community College). History Route 36 started operating in 1973 as Route 55 between Overlea and Towson, with branches via Joppa Road and Taylor Avenue, and to Hunt Valley. A year later, as the Route 9 was introduced, the Hunt Valley service on this line was truncated to Towson. In 1977, Route 55 was combined with Route 2, which had operated limited service between Overlea and Fox Ridge. For the next 20 years, the line operated from the Towson area to Franklin Square Hospital, with selected trips, mostly during rush hour, continuing to Fox Ridge. Express trips to the Essex area from Towson were also introduced, but were eliminated in 1992.MTA June 1992 schedule changes In 1997, all trips were extended to Fox Ridge.MTA Summer 1997 schedule changes In 1998, two daily trips which operated via Taylor Avenue through Parkville were discontinued. In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, it was proposed that Route 55 would operated every 30 minutes versus the previous 40, and Sunday service would be introduced. No routing changes were planned initially to Route 55. But this plan was later delayed due to public outcry over changes to other routes. In 2006, under a revision, MTA made plans for Route 55 to loop at the Towson Courthouse rather than GBMC, and for service on the remainder of the route to be provided on other lines. This plan was not implemented immediately. But on October 8, 2006, Sunday service was introduced, reflecting this new routing.MTA October 2006 schedule changes On February 17, 2008, these changes were implemented seven days a week,MTA February 2008 schedule changes despite public outcry over transfers that would be required to reach Towson University and area hospitals.

He was the founder of the Burid dynasty of Damascus. Biography Toghtekin was a junior officer to Tutush I, Seljuq emir of Damascus and Syria. After the former's death in 1095, civil war erupted, and Toghtekin supported Tutush's son Duqaq as emir of the city against Ridwan, the emir of Aleppo. In the chaotic years which ensued Toghtekin was sent to reconquer the town of Jebleh, which had rebelled against the qadi of Tripoli, but he was unable to accomplish his task. On October 21, 1097, a Crusader army began the siege of Antioch. The local emir, Yaghi-Siyan, though nominally under Ridwan's suzerainty, appealed to Duqaq to send an armed force to their rescue. Duqaq sent Toghtekin, but on December 31, 1097, he was defeated by Bohemund of Taranto and Robert II of Flanders, and was forced to retreat. Another relief attempt was made by a joint force under Kerbogha, the atabeg of Mosul, and Toghtekin, which was also crushed by the Crusaders on June 28, 1098. When the Crusaders moved southwards from the newly conquered Antioch, the qadi of Jebleh sold his town to Duqaq, who installed Toghtekin's son, Taj al-Muluk Buri as its ruler. His tyrannical rule, however, led to his quick downfall. In 1103, Toghtekin was sent by Duqaq to take possession of Homs at the request of its inhabitants, after the emir Janah al-Dawla had been murdered by Assassins by order of Ridwan. The following year Duqaq died and Toghtekin, now acting as regent and de facto ruler, had the former's junior son Tutush II proclaimed emir, while he married Duqaq's widow and reserved for himself the title of atabeg. After deposing Tutush II he had the brother of Duqaq, Irtash, named emir, but soon afterward he had him exiled. Irtash, with the support of Aytekin al-Halabi, the emir of Bosra, tried to reconquer Damascus, but was pushed back by Toghtekin and forced to find help at the court of King Baldwin I of Jerusalem. Around 1106 Toghtekin intervened to momentarily raise the siege of Tripoli by the Crusaders, but could not prevent the definitive capture of the city. In May 1108 he was able to defeat a small Christian force under Gervaise of Bazoches, lord of Galilee. Gervaise was proposed to be freed in exchange for his possession, but he refused and was executed. In April 1110 Toghtekin besieged and captured Baalbek and named his son Buri as governor, replacing al-Taj G√ºm√ºshtegin. Late in November 1111, the town of Tyre, which was besieged by Baldwin's troops, put itself under Toghtekin's protection. Toghtekin, supported by Fatimid forces, intervened, forcing the Franks to raise the siege on April 10, 1112; however, he refused to take part in the anti-Crusade effort launched by Mawdud of Mosul, fearing that the latter could take advantage of it to gain rule over the whole of Syria. Nonetheless, the next year the two Muslim commanders allied in reply to the ravages of Baldwin I and Tancred of Antioch. Their army besieged Tiberias, but they were unable to conquer it despite a sound victory at the Battle of Al-Sannabra in 1113 and they were forced to retreat to Damascus when Christian reinforcements arrived and supplies began to run out. During his sojourn in the city, Mawdud was killed by the Assassins on October 2, 1113. The inhabitants accused Toghtekin of the deed. In 1114, he signed an alliance against the Franks with the new emir of Aleppo, Alp ArslƒÅn al-Akhras, but the latter was murdered a short time later by his atabeg Lu ælu æ al-Yaya. In 1115 Toghtekin decided to ally himself with the Kingdom of Jerusalem against the Seljuk general Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, who had been sent by the Seljuk sultan Muhammad I Tapar to fight the Crusaders. The following year, judging the Franks too powerful, he visited Baghdad to obtain a pardon from the sultan, though never forgetting to remain independent himself between the two main forces. Allied with Ilghazi, emir of Aleppo, he attacked Athareb in the Principality of Antioch, but was defeated at the Battle of Hab on August 14, 1119. In the June of the following year he sent help to Ilghazi, who was again under peril of annihilation in the same place. In 1122 the Fatimids, no longer able to defend Tyre, sold it to Toghtekin, who installed a garrison there, but the garrison was unable to prevent its capture by the Frankss on July 7, 1124. In 1125, al-Bursuqi, now in control of Aleppo, appeared in the Antiochean territory with a large army which Toghtekin joined; however, the two were defeated at the Battle of Azaz on June 11, 1125. The following January Toghtekin also had to repel an invasion by Baldwin II of Jerusalem. In late 1126 he again invaded the Principality of Antioch with Bursuqi, but again with no results. Toghtekin died in 1128. He was succeeded by his son Buri. In the Old French Crusade cycle chansons de geste, Toghtekin is known as \\"Dodequin\\".

The former village development committee (VDC) was merged with Daulatpur, Naya Gaun, Badalpur, Bhimapur and Rajapur VDCs to form the new municipality on 18 May 2014. It is almost at the centre of river island called Bhawara Tappu of Karnali River. Badalpur village development committee (VDC) lies north of Manpur Tapara. Manau VDC lies northeast, Khairi Chandanpur VDC lies east and southeast, Bhimapur VDC lies south and southwest and Rajapur VDC lies west of Manpur Tapara. Although Manpur Tapara VDC does not touch international border between Nepal and India, it lies just half a kilometer north of International Border at Ishworiganj in Bhimapur VDC. Manpur Tapara is a plain fertile land in the western part of Bardiya district. It is an agricultural land with a well- developed irrigation system. Almost all of the VDC is connected with agricultural canals. More than 2500 hectares of land can be irrigated with these canals. These sophisticated irrigation canals were developed by Tharu people in the past using simple tools. The main source of water in these canals is the Maila Nala, which itself is a branch of Geruwa branch of Karnali river. Rice, wheat, maize, mustard and lentils are the major crops cultivated in Manpur Tapara. Karnali river brings heavy sediments during monsoon season and deposits in the canal beds and the field every year. Every year more than 2500 farmers contribute their muscle power to dig and clear the sediment deposits in the canal bed. Previously, it required more than two months of work to control the amount of water coming into Maila Nala from Geruwa. Every year earthen dam used to be reconstructed or repaired. Material used in the dam were, non compacted slab of soil called chapari or chyapa, branches of trees and cobbles and boulders. Thanks to the Rajapur Irrigation Project which constructed concrete dams. It also constructed many aqueducts, head and cross regulaters and off-sets at different locations in the canal system. Manpur Tapara used to be covered with agricultural land some forest and it had a small population of indigenous Tharu people just 50 years back. During the late 1940s and 1950s more Tharu people migrated from Dang valley and Deukhuri valley in the east. These people speak their own language which is called Tharu language. Their culture is unique and it is different from pahadiya people. Before 45 years, it had a very less population of Pahadi people. At present, there is a significant number of Pahadi population. At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 7,387 and had 842 houses in the town. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Nepal, in 2001 it had a total population of 9495 in which male population of 4738 and female population of 4757. Total number of households were 1307.

A  * Abundance - is a measure of how many fish are in a population or a fishing ground. See relative abundance and absolute abundance. * Acoustic survey - a systematic gathering of information on fish availability and abundance using underwater sound. * Acoustical oceanography - the use of underwater sound to map underwater topography and the contents of the sea. * Aerial survey - a method of gathering information on surface fish movement and density by visual observation and photography from low-flying aircraft. * Aggregation - any grouping of fish, for whatever reason (or unknown reason) they are concentrating. See shoaling. * Agricultural runoff - surplus water from agricultural land, often draining into rivers and then into the sea, and often enriched with nutrients, sediment, and agricultural chemicals. * Alginate production - a gel substance extracted from brown algae and used industrially as a thickening agent for food and paint. * Algal bloom - a rapid excessive growth of algae, generally caused by high nutrient levels, particularly phosphorus. When the algae die, algal blooms can deplete oxygen to the point where fish cannot survive. * Artisan - someone who practices a craft as a livelihood, as opposed to an artist, who practices an art for its own sake. * Artisan fishing - a term sometimes used to describe small scale commercial or subsistence fishing practices. The term particularly applies to coastal or island ethnic groups using traditional techniques and traditional fishing boats. * Anadromous - fish that live their adult lives in the ocean but migrate up fresh water rivers to spawn. Examples are Pacific salmon. Fish that migrate in the opposite direction are called catadromous. * Anoxic sea water - sea water depleted of oxygen. See hypoxia. * Anoxic sediments - sediments depleted of oxygen. * Antarctic convergence - a line encircling Antarctica where cold, northward-flowing Antarctic waters meet and sink beneath the sub-Antarctic waters, creating an upwelling zone which is very high in marine productivity, especially in Antarctic krill. * Aquaculture - the farming of freshwater and saltwater organisms including molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. See also fish farming and mariculture. * Availability - (1) the proportion of a fish population living where it can be fished. (2) catch per unit effort. (3) a term sometimes used to describe whether a given fish of a given size can be caught by a given type of gear in a given fishing area.  B  * Bait fish - are small fish caught for use as bait to attract large predatory fish. See forage fish. * Bathypelagic - the open ocean or pelagic zone that extends from a depth of 1000 to 4000 meters below the ocean surface. * Beach - a geological landform along the shoreline of a body of water, consisting of loose particles composed of rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, or cobble, or of shell fragments or coralline algae fragments. * Beam trawling - the simplest method of bottom trawling. The mouth of the trawl net is held open by a solid metal beam attached to two solid metal plates, welded to the ends of the beam, which slide over and disturb the seabed. This method is mainly used on smaller vessels, fishing for flatfish or prawns, relatively close inshore. * Bed - the bottom of a river, or watercourse, or any body of water, such as the seabed. * Benthic zone - the ecological region at the lowest level of a body of water such as an ocean or a lake, including the sediment surface and some sub-surface layers. Organisms living in this zone are called benthos. * Benthos - aquatic organisms which live on or in the seabed, also known as the benthic zone. Included are both mobile animals, such as crabs and abalone, and non mobile animals, such as corals and sponges. * Billfish - large, predatory fish characterised by their long sword-like bill. Billfish include the sailfish, marlin and swordfish. They are important apex predators feeding on a wide variety of smaller fish and cephalopods. * Bioacoustics - in underwater acoustics and fisheries acoustics this term is used to mean the effect of plants and animals on sound propagated underwater, usually in reference to the use of sonar technology for biomass estimation * Bimodal - a bimodal distribution is a distribution with two different modes which appear as distinct peaks. An example in fisheries is the length of fish in a fishery, which might show two or more modes or peaks reflecting fish of different ages or species. * Biodiversity - is the variation of life forms within an area. In the context of fisheries the number and variety of organisms found within a fishery. * Biomass - the total weight of a fish species in a given area. Can be measured as the total weight in tons of a stock in a fishery, or can be measured per square metre or square kilometre. The most successful species worldwide, in terms of biomass, may be the Antarctic krill, with about five times the total biomass of humans. * Biotone - a region where a distinctive transition from one set of biota to another occurs. An example is the region where tropical and temperate waters mix. * Biotoxins - natural toxins produced by organisms, often for use as a defence mechanism. * Bony fish - fish that have a bony skeleton and belong to the class osteichthyes. Basically, this is all fish except for sharks, rays, skates, hagfish and lampreys. * Bottom trawling - a fishing method that involves towing trawl nets along the sea floor. Bottom trawling can cause serious damage to sea floor habitats. * Brackish water - water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries. * Breach - a whale's leap out of the water. * Breaker zone - the zone where ocean surface waves approaching the shore commence breaking, typically in water depths between five and ten metres. * Brood - the collective offspring of a species produced in a particular time span. See also cohort. * Buoy - a floating object usually moored to the bottom. Buoys can be used as temporary markers, called dans, during Danish seine fishing to mark the anchor position of a net, or when fishing with lobster pots to mark the position of the pots. * Bycatch - bycatch is the harvest of marine life and seabirds during fishing operations when other fish were the target. For example, bycatch might consist of a species which was not the targeted species, such as a shark caught on a tuna longline. Or it might consist of fish of the targeted species, but not of the targeted age or size. Some shrimp fisheries have a bycatch five times the weight of the caught shrimp. See also incidental catch.  C  * Carapace - a calcified protective cover on the upper frontal surface of crustaceans. It is particularly well developed in lobsters and crabs. * Carrying capacity - the supportable population of a species, given the food, habitat conditions and other resources available within a fishery. * Casting - the act of throwing bait or a lure over the water, using a fishing rod. * Catadromous - fish that live their adult lives in fresh water lakes or rivers but migrate down rivers to spawn in the sea. An example are freshwater eels of genus Anguilla, whose larvae drift on the open ocean, sometimes for months or years, before travelling thousands of kilometres back to their original rivers (see eel life history). Fish that migrate in the opposite direction are called anadromous. * Cephalopods - (from the Greek for \\"head-feet\\") animals such as squid and octopus where tentacles converge at the head. Cephalopods are the most intelligent of the invertebrates with well-developed senses and large brains. * Cetacean - member of the group of marine mammals that includes whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully adapted to aquatic life and are noted for their high intelligence. * Cetacean bycatch - the incidental capture of non-target cetacean species by fisheries. Bycatch can be caused by entanglement in fishing nets and lines, or direct capture by hooks or in trawl nets. * Climate change - variation in the Earth's global climate or in regional climates over time. Climate change involves changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time periods ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by natural processes on Earth, external factors including variations in sunlight intensity, and more recently by human activities. * cohort - those individuals of a stock born in the same spawning season. For annual spawners, a year's recruitment of new individuals to a stock is a single cohort or year-class. See brood. * Commercial fishery - An umbrella term covering fisheries resources and the whole process of catching and marketing fish, molluscs and crustaceans. It includes the fishermen and their boats, and all activities and resources involved in harvesting, processing, and selling. * Conspecific - organisms or populations that belong to the same species. Organisms that don't belong to the same species are heterospecific. * Continental margin - the zone of the ocean floor that separates the thin oceanic crust from the thick continental crust. Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area. * Continental rise - is below the slope, but landward of the abyssal plains. Extending as far as 500 kilometres from the slope, it consists of thick sediments which have cascaded down the slope and accumulated as a pile at the base of the slope. * Continental shelf - the seabed from the shore to the edge of the continental slope, covered by relatively shallow seas (known as shelf seas) and gulfs. * Continental slope - the slope which starts, usually abruptly at about a 200-metre depth, at the outer edge of the continent shelf and dips more steeply down to the deep-ocean floor (abyssal plain). * Coriolis effect - due to the Earth's rotation, freely moving objects on the surface of the earth veer right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere. This effect is called the Coriolis effect, and works, in particular, on winds and ocean currents. The effect varies with latitude and is zero at the equator and increases towards the poles. * Cottage industry - small, locally owned businesses usually associated in fishing with traditional methods and low relative yield. * Crab pot fishery - a fishing technique where crabs are lured by bait into portable traps, sometimes called pots. * Crustaceans - A group of freshwater and saltwater animals having no backbone, with jointed legs and a hard shell made of chitin. Includes crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp and krill.  D  * Danish seine - a widely used commercial fishing technique which uses a small trawl net with long wire warps. The seine boat drags the warps and the net in a circle around the fish. The motion of the warps herds the fish into the central net. Danish seining works best on demersal fish which are either scattered on or close to the bottom of the sea, or are aggregated (schooling). See also purse seine. * Dead zone - an area in an ocean or large lake where oxygen levels are extremely low, often due to eutrophication. Dead zones have been increasing since the 1970s. * Deep ocean currents - currents in the deep ocean, also known as thermohaline circulation or the \\"conveyor belt\\", are driven by density and temperature gradients. They can be contrasted with surface ocean currents, which are driven by the wind. * Demersal zone - the zone at or near the bottom of a sea or lake. Inhabitants of the demersal zone feed off the bottom or off other demersal fish. See also pelagic zone. * Demersal fish - fish that live in the demersal zone. Examples are cod, flounder and snapper. Compared to pelagic fish, demersal fish contain little oil. See also bottom feeder. * Demersal trawling - trawling on or near the bottom of a sea or lake. See also bottom trawling. * Depletion - reducing the abundance of a fish stock through fishing. * Delisted - a species which is no longer listed under the ESA. See also recovered species. * Diatoms - minute planktonic unicellular or colonial algae. * Downwelling - A downward movement (sinking) of surface water caused by onshore Ekman transport, converging currents or when a water mass becomes more dense than the surrounding water. * dorsal - relating to or situated near or on the back. * Dredging - dredge designed to catch scallops, oysters or sea cucumbers are towed along the bottom of the sea by specially designed dredge boats. * Driftnet - a gillnet suspended by floats so that it fishes the top few metres of the water column. Drift nets can be many kilometres long. Because drift nets are not anchored to the sea bottom or connected to a boat, they are sometimes lost in storms and become ghost nets. * Dropline - a fishing line with one or more hooks, held vertically in the water column with weights and generally used on the continental shelf and slope. Several droplines may be operated by a vessel, either on manually or mechanically operated reels.  E  * Echinoderms - a group of marine animals that includes seastars, sea urchins and sea cucumbers, abundant on the floor of the deep sea, as well as in shallower seas. * Ecologically sustainable development - in the context of fisheries, using, conserving and enhancing fishery resources so that the ecological processes, on which the fish depend, are not degraded. * Economic rent - the profit that could be earned from a fishery owned by an individual. Individual ownership maximizes profit, but an open entry policy usually results in so many fishermen that profit barely matches opportunity cost. See maximum economic yield. * Ectothermic - animals that control body temperature through external means, using the sun, or flowing air or water. * Ekman transport - resultant flow at right angles to and to the right of the wind direction in the northern hemisphere, to the left in the southern hemisphere. * Elasmobranch - cartilaginous fish that includes sharks, skates and rays. Compare bony fish. * Electrophoresis - A technique used by fisheries scientists. Tissue samples are taken from fish, and electrophoresis is used to separate proteins such as enzymes, based on their different mobilities in an electric field. This information is used to differentiate between morphologically similar species and to distinguish sub-populations or stocks. * El Ni√±o - large scale, cyclical (generally three to seven years), ocean warming and cooling episodes across the equatorial Pacific. Warm water pools in the east in El Ni√±o conditions and in the west during La Ni√±a conditions. It begins around Christmas (El Ni√±o means Christ child). These changes disrupt weather patterns and the migration habits of fish. * Endangered species - An endangered species is a population of an organism which is at risk of becoming extinct. The IUCN has calculated the percentage of endangered species as 40 percent of all organisms based on the sample of species that have been evaluated through to 2006. * Endemic - native to a certain region, often a fairly small local area. * Endothermic - animals which maintain a body temperature which is above ambient temperature. See Ectothermic. * Epibenthos - invertebrates that live on top of the seabed. Compare benthos. * Epipelagic - The top layer of the ocean from the surface down to about 200 metres. This is the illuminated zone where there is enough light for photosynthesis. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. See photic zone. * Escapement - the percentage of a spawning anadromous fish population that survives all obstacles during their migration, including fishing pressure and predation, and successfully reach their spawning grounds. * Estuary - a semi-enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. Healthy estuaries can have high rates of biological productivity. * Eulittoral zone - another name for the intertidal zone or foreshore, extending from the spring high tide line to the neap low tide line. * Euryhaline - fish that are tolerant to a wide range of salinities. * Eutrophication - an increase in chemical nutrients ‚Äì typically compounds containing nitrogen or phosphorus ‚Äì in an ecosystem. Eutrophication in water often results in an increase in algae growth and decay, which can lead to decreased levels of oxygen and fish populations. * Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) - a seazone under the law of the sea over which a state has special rights to the exploration and use of marine resources. Generally a state's EEZ extends to a distance of 200 nautical miles (370 km) out from its coast.  F  * Farmed fisheries - are fisheries where the fish are farmed using aquaculture techniques. They can be contrasted with wild fisheries. * Fecundity - the number of eggs a fish produces each reproductive cycle; the potential reproductive capacity of an organism or population. Fecundity changes with the age and size of the fish. * Fish - a true fish is a vertebrate with gills that lives in water. However, in the context of fisheries, the term \\"fish\\" is generally used more broadly to include any harvestable animal living in water, including molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms. :::*the term \\"shellfish\\" refers to molluscs :::*the term \\"finfish\\" refers to bony fishes, sharks and some rays :::*the term \\"scalefish\\" refers to fish bearing scales :::*the term \\"fish\\" can refer to more than one fish, particularly when the fish are from the same species :::*the term \\"fishes\\" refers to more than one species of fish * Fishing - the activity of trying to catch fish * Fisherman or fisher - someone who captures fish and other animals from a body of water, or gathers shellfish. * Fishery - the activities leading to and resulting in the harvesting of fish. It may involve capture of wild fish or raising of fish through aquaculture. A fishery is characterised by the species caught, the fishing gear used, and the area of operation. * Fishing effort - a measure of how much work is needed by fisherman to catch fish. Different measures are appropriate for different kinds of fisheries. * Fishmeal - protein-rich animal feed product based on fish. * Fishing trip - usually performed by using a vessel, fishing trip starts when departing a port and ends when returning to port or in some cases when landing the catch. Fishing trip consists of different types of activities performed when fishing, for example - setting traps, recovering traps, crossing a fishing zone, relocating catch, discarding catch etc. * Fishing vessel - any vessel normally used for the harvesting of living aquatic resources or in support of such activity. This includes vessels which provide assistance to other fishing vessels such as supply, storage, refrigeration, transportation or processing (mother ships). * Fishing fleet - an aggregation of fishing vessels of a particular country, such as the Russian fishing fleet, or using a particular gear, such as purse seine fleet. * Flushing time - the time required to replace all the water in an estuary or harbour by the actions of currents and tides. * Fork length - in fishes with forked tails, this measures from the tip of the snout to the fork of the tail. It is used in fishes when is difficult to tell where the vertebral column ends. * Forage fish - are small fish which are preyed on by larger predators. Typical ocean forage fish are small, filter-feeding fish such as herring, anchovies and menhaden. They compensate for their small size by forming schools. See bait fish. * Foreshore - intertidal area between the highest and lowest tide levels * Founder effect - the loss of genetic variation when a new colony is established by some individuals moving to a new area that is unoccupied. As a result, the new population may be distinctively different from its parent population. * Free-diving - diving under water without the assistance of breathing apparatus to collect oysters, abalone, corals, sponges, crayfish etc. The gear usually includes a snorkel, face mask, flippers, weight belt and wet suit. * Front - region of sharp gradient in temperature or salinity, indicating a transition between two current systems or water masses. Fronts are usually associated with high biological activity and high abundance of highly migratory resources such as tuna. They are actively sought as fishing areas and can be monitored by satellite remote sensing.  G  * Gametes - eggs and sperm. * Gear - the equipment used by fishermen when fishing. Some examples are hooks, lines, sinkers, floats, rods, reels, baits, lures, spears, nets, gaffs, traps, waders and tackle boxes. * Gene flow - The movement of genes from one population to another by individuals moving between the populations. * Ghost nets - fishing nets and other gear that has been left or lost in the ocean and continues to capture and kill fish. * Gillnet - fishing nets constructed so that fish are entangled or enmeshed, usually in the gills, by the netting. According to their design, ballasting and buoyancy, these nets can be used to fish on the surface, in midwater or on the bottom. The mesh size of the net determines the size of fish caught, since smaller fish can swim through the mesh. See also drift net. * Global positioning system - a device which uses satellite signals to accurately determine a fishing vessel's position and course. * Global warming - the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans in recent decades, as well as the projected continuation of this trend. * Groundfish - fish that lives most of its life on or near the sea bottom, such as cod, haddock, or flounder. * Gulf - a large area of water bordered by land on three sides.  H  * Habitat - the place where an organism lives. * Halocline - a zone in which salinity changes rapidly. * Harmful algal bloom (HAB) - an algal bloom that produces toxins detrimental to plants and animals. Scientists prefer this term to red tide, since not all algal blooms are harmful, nor do all algal blooms cause discoloration, and the blooms are not associated with tides. * Harvest - the number or weight of fish caught and retained from a given area over a given period of time. Note that landings, catch, and harvest are different. * Hatchery - the process of cultivating and breeding a large number of juveniles in an enclosed environment. The juveniles are then released into lakes, rivers or fish farm enclosures. * High seas - waters outside national jurisdictions. * Highly migratory species - a term which has its origins in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It refers to fish species which undertake ocean migrations and also have wide geographic distributions. It usually denotes tuna and tuna-like species, shark, marlins and swordfish. See also transboundary stocks and straddling stocks. * Husbandry - the farming practice of breeding and raising fish stock. * Hypoxia - occurs in aquatic environments when dissolved oxygen becomes depletion to a level which is harmful to aquatic organisms.  I  * Incidental catch - the catch of non- fish species, caught in the course of commercial fishing practices. Examples of non-fish species are seabirds, and marine mammals and reptiles, such as dolphins, seals and sea turtles. Incidental mortality can be contrasted with bycatch, which is a general term for the catch of all fish and non-fish species other than the targeted species. * Individual transferable quota (ITQ) - a management tool by which the total allowable catch quota is allocated to individual fishers or companies who have long-term rights over the quota or can transfer it to others by sale, lease, or will. See also quota. * Intertidal - The intertidal zone is the region of land which is submerged during high tide and exposed during low tide. * Introduced species - Species brought into an area where it does not naturally occur, but is able to survive and reproduce there. * Invertebrates - animals without a backbone, such as octopus, shellfish, jellyfish and corals. See also vertebrates. * Isobath - a contour line linking regions of the same depth. * Isopleth - contour line joining points corresponding to similar values. Often used to plot yield-per- recruit values on a graph showing the changes as a function of size-at-first- capture and fishing mortality. * Isopods - group of small crustaceans that includes fish lice. * isotherm - contour line connecting points with the same temperature. Summary of 2006 IUCN Red List categories. * IUCN - the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources is the world's main authority on the conservation status of species. Their system divides threatened species into three categories: critically endangered (CR), endangered (EN), and vulnerable (VU). They also list extinctions that have occurred since 1500 AD and taxa that are extinct in the wild. * IUCN Red List - the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (also known as the IUCN Red List or Red Data List), created in 1963, is the world's most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of plant and animal species.  J  * Jigging - a method of fishing which uses lures on a vertical line that is moved up and down, or jigged. Jigging can be done manually with hand-operated spools. It is also done automatically using machines when fishing for arrow squid. *Jukung - a traditional fishing boat used in Indonesia. * Juvenile - a young fish or animal that has not reached sexual maturity.  K   L  * La Ni√±a - a condition involving an excessive pooling of cool water which occurs in the equatorial Eastern Pacific Ocean. See El Ni√±o. * Lagoon - a body of shallow salt or brackish water separated from the deeper sea by a shallow or exposed sandbank, coral reef, or similar feature. * Land runoff - rainfall, snow melt or irrigation water that runs off the land into streams and other surface water, and ultimately into the ocean. Land runoff can carry pollutants, such as petroleum, pesticides, and fertilizers. * Landing - the amount of fish (usually in tons) harvested from the sea and brought to the land. May be different from the catch, which includes the discards. Landings are reported at the points at which fish are brought to shore. Most often, landings provide the only record of total catch, i.e. landings plus discards. Note landings, catch, and harvest define different things. * Line fishing - a general term for fishing methods which use fishing lines. It includes handlines, hand reels, powered reels, pole-and-line, droplines, longlines, trotlines and troll lines. * Littoral - the shallow water region around lake or sea shores where significant light penetrates to the bottom. Typically occupied by rooted plants. On sea shores it includes the intertidal zone. * Logbook - an official record of catch and its species composition, fishing effort and location, recorded on board the fishing vessel. In many fisheries, logbooks are a compulsory condition of licensing. * Longlines - a long fishing line with many short lines, called snoods and carrying hooks, attached at regular intervals. Pelagic longlines are suspended horizontally at a fixed depth using surface floats. Demersal longlines are weighted at the seabed and have closer-spaced hooks. A longline can be miles long with several thousand hooks.  M  * Mariculture - a particular branch of aquaculture where marine organisms are cultivated in the open ocean, or an enclosure of the ocean, or in tanks, ponds or raceways filled with seawater. Examples are the farming of marine fish, prawns, oysters and seaweed. * Marine mammal - mammals that are primarily ocean-dwelling or depend on the ocean for food, such as porpoises, whales, seals, walrus and polar bears. * Marine protected area (MPA) - marine area with some level of legal restriction to protect living, non-living, cultural, and/or historic resources. * Maximum economic yield (MEY) - the total amount of profit that could be earned from a fishery if it were owned by one individual. An open entry policy usually results in too many fishermen so profits are barely higher than opportunity costs. See economic rent. * Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) - the maximum catch that can be taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period. Under the assumption of logistic growth, the MSY will be exactly at half the carrying capacity of a species, as this is the stage at when population growth is highest. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the optimum sustainable yield. Studies have shown that fishing at the level of MSY is often not sustainable. See also long-term potential yield. * Meristics - A series of measurements on a fish, such as scale counts, which are used to separate different populations or races of fish. * Mesopelagic - ocean depths extending from 200 to 1000 metres (650 to 3280 feet) below sea level * Migration - a systematic (as opposed to random) movement of individuals in a fish stock from one place to another. * Minimum landing size - the smallest length at which it is legal to keep or sell a fish. Sizes vary with the species of fish and also vary in different places around the world. * Population model - a hypothesis of how a population functions. It often uses mathematical descriptions of growth, recruitment and mortality. * Mollusc - A group of freshwater and saltwater animals with no skeleton and usually one or two hard shells made of calcium carbonate. Includes oysters, clams, mussels, snails, conches, scallops, squid and octopus. * Morphometrics - Measurements which characterise the form, shape and appearance of an animal or plant. Difference in morphometrics, such as colouration, can be used to distinguish different stocks of the same species. * Mortality - Mortality is a death rate from various causes, such as the proportion of a fish stock dying annually. See also natural mortality and fishing mortality. * Mud flat - are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by the tides or rivers, sea and oceans. They are found in sheltered areas such as bays, bayous, lagoons, and estuaries.  N  * Natal - relating to birth, such as many salmon that return to their place of birth to spawn. * Nearshore waters - relatively shallow inshore waters that do not extend beyond the continental shelf. See also sublittoral zone * Neritic zone - the shallow pelagic zone over the continental shelf. See also nearshore waters. * Nitrate - a water-soluble molecule made up of nitrogen and oxygen, commonly found in agricultural fertilizers, and therefore in land runoff. Too much nitrate concentration is can be toxic to marine life. * Nursery - The part of a fish or animal habitat where the young grow up. * Nutrient upwelling - Nutrient upwelling is the 'welling-up' of deeper water that is usually richer in nutrients than surface water.  O  * Ocean basin - geologically an ocean basin is a large geologic basin which is below sea level. * Ocean currents - Oceanic currents can be divided into surface and deep ocean currents. Surface currents are generally wind driven and develop typical clockwise spirals in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise spirals in the southern hemisphere. Surface currents can operate to a depth of 400 meters and apply to about ten percent of water in the ocean. Deep ocean currents are driven by density gradients in water due to temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline) differences. This thermohaline circulation, occurs at both deep and shallow ocean levels and moves much slower than tidal or surface currents. Upwelling and downwelling areas in the oceans are areas where significant vertical currents of water are observed. Ocean currents can be contrasted with the tidal currents that occur in coastal areas. * Ocean surface waves - are surface waves that occur on the free surface of the ocean. They usually result from wind, and are also referred to as wind waves. Some waves can travel thousands of miles before reaching land. * Ocean Tracking Network - a research effort using implanted acoustic transmitters to study fish migration patterns. * Oceanodromous - fish that migrate only within salt (ocean) waters. * Oceanography - the branch of earth sciences that studies the ocean, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents and waves; plate tectonics and the formation of underwater topography; and movements of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. * Otoliths - calcareous deposits or bones found in chambers at the base of the skull in fish. Sectioned, these bones often show rings or layers which can be used to determine age. * Otter trawl - An otter trawl is a demersal trawl which uses large rectangular otter boards to keep the opening of the trawl net from closing. Otter trawls are towed by a single trawler. * Overfishing - occurs when fishing activities reduce fish stocks below an acceptable level. This can occur in any body of water from a pond to the oceans. * Oxytetracycline - an antibiotic which is injected in a fish to leave a mark on its skeletal structures such as otoliths. When the fish is later recaptured, the mark left can be used to validate age estimates.  P  * Pair trawling - occurs when two trawlers tow the same net. Otter boards are not needed and very large nets can be held open and towed in this manner. * Panmictic - refers to random mating where all individuals within a population are potential partners. * Parameter - parameter in fisheries is a characteristic measure of some aspect of a fish stock. it is usually expressed as a numerical value, such as the \\"natural mortality rate\\". * Pelagic zone - any water in the sea that is not close to the bottom. * Pelagic fish - fish that spend most of their life swimming and feeding in the pelagic zone, as opposed to resting on or feeding off the bottom. Examples are tuna and most sharks. * Phosphate - a chemical compound containing phosphorus and oxygen, commonly found in agricultural fertilizers and land runoff. * Photic zone - \\"sun lit\\" zone extending downward from a lake or ocean surface to the euphotic depth where the light intensity falls to one percent of that at the surface. The photic zone exposed to sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis to occur. The depth of the photic zone can be greatly affected by seasonal turbidity. Typical euphotic depths vary from only a few centimetres in highly turbid eutrophic lakes, to around 200 metres in the open ocean. About 90% of all marine life lives in this region. * Plankton - consist of any drifting organisms (animals, plants, archaea or bacteria) that inhabit the pelagic zones, particularly the surface areas, of oceans or bodies of fresh water. * Population - See stock. * Population dynamics - The study of fish populations and how fishing mortality, growth, recruitment, and natural morality affect them. * Precautionary principle - a moral and political principle which states that if an action or policy might cause severe or irreversible harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of a scientific consensus that harm would not ensue, the burden of proof falls on those who would advocate taking the action * Predator-Prey - A predator is a species that feeds on other species. A prey is a species that is being eaten by a predator. * Primary Productivity - A measurement of plant production that is the start of the food chain. Much primary productivity in marine or aquatic systems is made up of phytoplankton, which are tiny one-celled algae that float freely in the water. * Projection - With the help of a mathematical model as a numerical representation of the population, a projection is a prediction of what may happen in the future under a variety of conditions. * purse seine - a fishing technique capable of harvesting large quantities of surface-schooling pelagic fish by surrounding the school with a net. A line which passes through rings on the bottom of the net can be tightened to close the net so that the fish are unable to escape. See also Danish seine. * Phytoplankton - tiny, free-floating, photosynthetic organisms in aquatic systems.  Q  * Quota - Quota is the amount of catch that can be legally landed in a time period. It could refer to a fishery as a whole (total allowable catch) or to an amount allocated to an individual or company. See also individual transferable quota. * Quota management system (QMS) - a system that limits the amount of fish that can be taken by commercial fishers. The QMS sets a quota that can be taken by each commercial fisher.  R  * Recruitment - the number of new young fish that enter a population in a given year. More pragmatically, it can be defined as the number of young fish that attain a size where they can be legally caught, or become susceptible to being caught by a given fishing gear. * Red tide - discolouration of surface waters, most frequently in coastal zones, caused by large concentrations of micro-organisms. See harmful algal bloom. * Risk analysis - evaluates the possible outcomes of various harvesting strategies or management options.  S  * Salinity gradient - Salinity gradient: Change in salinity with depth, expressed in parts per thousand per metre. See halocline. * Sample - A relatively small part of a fish stock which is removed for study, and which ideally is representative of the whole. The greater the number and size of the samples, the greater the confidence that the information obtained accurately reflects the status (such as abundance by number or weight, or age composition) of the stock. * Seamounts - underwater mountains rising at least 1000 metres above the sea floor. * Sea grass - members of marine seed plants that grow chiefly on sand or sand-mud bottom. They are most abundant in water less than 10 metres deep. Common types are eel grass, turtle grass and manatee grass. * Selectivity - ability of a type of fishing tackle or gear to catch a certain size or kind of fish, compared with its ability to catch other sizes or kinds. * Seashore - the coast or that part of the land adjoining or near the ocean. See intertidal zone. * Shelf break - where the continental shelf and continental slope meet. At the shelf break, the more gently sloping region of the seabed adjacent to a landmass rather abruptly slopes moresteeply down towards the ocean depths, commonly around depths of 200 metres. * Shellfish - general term for aquatic invertebrates (molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms). * Shoal - or sandbar is a somewhat linear landform within or extending into a body of water, typically composed of sand, silt or small pebbles. Bars can appear in the sea, in a lake, or in a river. * Shoaling - describes the behaviour of fish which aggregate together, including mixed species groups. Fish derive many benefits from shoaling behaviour including defence against predators through better predator detection and by diluting the chance of capture, enhanced foraging success, and higher success in finding a mate. It is also likely that fish benefit from shoal membership through increased hydrodynamic efficiency. * Shore - A shore or shoreline is the fringe of land at the edge of a large body of water, such as an ocean, sea, or lake. A shore of unconsolidated material is usually called a beach. See intertidal zone. * Simulation - An analysis that shows the production and harvest of fish using a group of equations to represent the fishery. It can be used to predict events in the fishery if certain factors change. See population dynamics. * Socioeconomics - A word used to identify the importance of factors other than biology in fishery management decisions. For example, if management results in more fishing income, it is important to know how the income is distributed between small and large boats or part-time and full-time fishermen. * Spawning - the production or depositing of large quantities of eggs in water. * Species - a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring. * Species density - the number of species in a sampled area. * Species group - a group of similar species. Similar species are often difficult to differentiate without detailed examination. * Sport fishery - See recreational fishery. * Stakeholder - anyone who has a stake or interest in the outcome of the project, as well as anyone one who is affected by the project. * Standardization - procedures which maintain methods and equipment as constant as possible. Without standardization one cannot determine whether measurements of yearly differences in relative abundance are caused by actual fluctuations in stock abundance or by differences in the measurement procedure used. Lack of standardization is one reason why surveys using different commercial fishing vessels in different years do not produce comparable information. For example, if two vessels of different horsepower are used in separate years, the results can't be compared unless vessel mensuration experiments are performed. This would involve comparing the two vessels' catches to determine the influence of their fishing power on the size of the catch, and a determination of a correction factor. * Stock - group of fish of the same species (for example, snapper) that occupy a defined area of the ocean. Fish stocks are the basis of fisheries‚Äô management. Not to be confused with stockfish. * Straddling stocks - A term defined by the United Nations as \\"stocks of fish such as pollock, which migrate between, or occur in both, the economic exclusion zone of one or more states and the high seas\\". They can contrasted with transboundary stocks. A stock can be both transboundary and straddling. * Subantarctic waters - waters adjacent to, but not within, the Antarctic circle (about 66030'S). * Subtropical waters - waters adjacent to, but not within, the tropics. * Super seiner - a large purse seiner, usually over 70 metres long, with freezing and storage facilities, and capable of fishing for an extended period in open oceans. * Surf - collective term for breakers. Also the wave activity in the area between the shoreline and the outermost limit of breakers. * Surf zone - As ocean surface waves come closer to shore they break, forming the foamy, bubbly surface called surf. The region of breaking waves defines the surf zone. * Surface ocean currents - surface currents are generally wind driven and develop typical clockwise spirals in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise rotation in the southern hemisphere. In wind driven currents, the Ekman spiral effect results in the currents flowing at an angle to the driving winds. Surface currents make up about ten percent of the water in the ocean, and are generally restricted to the upper 400 meters. They can be contrasted with deep ocean currents, which are driven by density and temperature gradients. * Surplus production - Surplus production is the inherent productivity of a fish stock that can be harvested on a sustainable basis. Based on the theory that, at large stock size, reproductive rates and rate of stock growth are slowed by self-regulating mechanisms, and that stock growth rates are faster after removals, as the stock attempts to rebuild. In theory, fishing can be moderated to take advantage of the more productive stock growth rates, provided that it does not exceed the stock recovery capacity. * Sustainable fishing - fishing activities that do not cause or lead to undesirable changes in biological and economic productivity, biological diversity, or ecosystem structure and functioning, from one human generation to the next. * Sustainable yield - Sustainable yield is the catch that can be removed over an indefinite period without causing the stock to be depleted. This could be either a constant yield from year to year, or a yield which is allowed to fluctuate in response to changes in abundance.  T  * Tag and release - marking or attaching a tag to a fish so that it can be identified on recapture. Used for the study of fish growth, movement, migration, and stock structure and size. * Threatened species - Threatened species are species which are vulnerable to extinction in the near future. The IUCN further divides them into three categories: vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered. * Tidal current - alternating horizontal movement of water in coastal areas, associated with the rise and fall of the tide as the earth rotates. The rise and fall is caused by gravitational forces exerted by the moon and the sun. Unlike ocean currents, tidal currents change in regular patterns that can be predicted for future dates. * Tidal flats - are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by tides or rivers. Also called mudflats. * Transboundary stocks - are fish stocks which range across the EEZs of two or more countries. They can be contrasted with straddling stocks. A stock can be both transboundary and straddling. * Trap fishing - fishing by means of traps, often designed to catch a particular species, such with lobster pots. * Trash fish - catch with no commercial value which is discarded, especially when trawling. Also called rough fish. See also coarse fish. * Trawling - is fishing with a large bag-like net, called a trawl, which is drawn along behind a boat called a trawler. The net can be dragged along the sea bottom in order to target demersal fish, or pulled through clear water in order to target pelagic fish. Trawling along the sea bottom can result in significant bycatch and habitat destruction. * Trophic level - The position that a species occupies in a food chain. The species it eats are at a lower trophic level, and the species that eats it are at a higher trophic level. * Trolling - a method of fishing where one or more fishing lines, baited with lures or bait fish, are drawn slowly through the water behind a boat. Trolling is used to catch pelagic fish such as mackerel and tuna species. * Turbidity current - a current of rapidly moving, sediment-laden water that is heavier than clear water and therefore flows downslope along the bottom of the sea or a lake. The term is most commonly used to describe underwater currents in lakes and oceans, which are usually triggered by earthquakes or slumping. * Turtle excluder device (TED) - a specialized device that allows a captured sea turtle to escape when caught in a trawl net.  U  * Underwater acoustics - due to its excellent propagation properties, underwater sound is used as a tool to aid the study of marine life, from microplankton to the blue whale. See also Ocean Tracking Network. * Upwelling - the process by which water, usually cold and nutrient-rich, rises from a deeper to a shallower depth. This is often a result of offshore surface water flow, particularly when persistent wind blows parallel to a coastland and the resultant Ekman transport moves surface water away from the coast.  V  * Vertebrates - animals with a backbone, including fish (sharks, rays and bony fish), amphibians, reptiles and mammals. See also invertebrates. * Vessel monitoring system (VMS) - technology used in commercial fishing to allow environmental and fisheries regulatory organizations to track the location of vessels. * Virtual population analysis (VPA) - an analysis of fish population numbers that uses the number of fish caught at various ages or lengths and an estimate of natural mortality to estimate fishing mortality in a cohort. It also provides a back estimate of the number of fish in a cohort at various ages. * Vulnerable species - a species which is likely to become an endangered species unless the circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve.  W  * Wetlands - areas of land where the soil is saturated with moisture, such as swamps and mangrove forests. * Wild fish - are fish which live free, not penned in, in lakes, rivers or the sea. They can be contrasted with farmed fish. * Wild fisheries - also called \\"capture fisheries\\", are fisheries which target wild fish. They can be contrasted with farmed fisheries. * Wind currents - currents created by the action of the wind. Surface ocean currents are generally wind driven and develop typical clockwise spirals in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise rotation in the southern hemisphere. In wind driven currents, the Ekman spiral effect results in the currents flowing at an angle to the driving winds. Surface currents make up about ten percent of the water in the ocean, and are generally restricted to the upper 400 meters.

He devoted his career to improve the education system of the United States. He was the father of Charles Russell Bardeen and grandfather of two- time Nobel Prize winning physicist John Bardeen. He was referred to as C.W. by the later generations of Bardeens.Hoddeson, Lillian; Vicki Daitch. True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen. p. 11 Early life C.W. was born in 1847 in Groton, Massachusetts, to an abolitionist family. He left school at the age of fourteen to enlist in the Northern Army in the American Civil War, where he signed up as a drummer boy. He was a poor drummer and because of that, he spent the Civil War as a fifer. After the end of the Civil War, he worked his way through Yale University, and graduated from Yale in 1869. Career After completing his graduation, C.W. found employment as a vice-principal and teacher, and held several positions as school principal, superintendent, and college English professor until 1873. His son Charles R. Bardeen was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1871. C.W. moved his family to Syracuse, New York in 1874. He established his own publishing company, School Bulletin Publications, that year. He became managing editor of the School Bulletin in 1874 and retained that position for almost fifty years. The magazine became a forum for expressing his strong views on the importance of quality education. In the 1880s and 1890s, C.W. made a number of trips to Europe and northern Africa, and he wrote up his travel adventures for the Bulletin. C.W. took positions of national leadership in the National Education Association and the Educational Press Association of America. He was invited for membership in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Geographical Society, and the American Social Science Association.

Relations began in the early 18th century, as the French East India Company was attempting to extend its influence into Southeast Asia. France became involved upon the building of a shipyard in 1729 in the city of Syriam. The 1740 revolt of the Mon against Burmese rule however forced the French to depart in 1742. They were able to return to Siam in 1751 when the Mon requested French assistance against the Burmese. A French envoy, Sieur de Bruno was sent to evaluate the situation and help in the defense against the Burmese. French warships were sent to support the Mon rebellion, but in vain. In 1756, the Burmese under Alaungpaya vanquished the Mon. Many French were captured and incorporated into the Burmese Army as an elite gunner corps, under Chevalier Milard. In 1769, official contacts resume when a trade treaty was signed between king Hsinbyushin and the French East India Company. Soon however, France became embroiled in the French revolution and Napoleonic wars, giving way to overwhelming British influence in Burma. French contacts with Burma, effectively a British colony, would become almost non-existent, while from the second half of the 19th century France would concentrate in the establishment of French Indochina and the conflicts with China leading to the Sino-French war.  French shipyard in Syriam (1729-1742)  Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix initiated French intervention in Burma. The Governor-General of French India Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix had started to show interest in Burma since 1727, on account of the country's abundance in teak and crude oil. As a result, a French shipyard was established in the city of Syriam in 1729, building ships for Pondicherry.Hall, Burma, p. 78. The shipyard was abandoned in 1742 due to the revolt of the Mon. Intervention in Burma (1751) A few years later, a Mon envoy visited Dupleix requesting French help in the fight against the Burmese.Harrison, p. 148. Dupleix promised men and munitions and dispatched Sieur de Bruno with the objective of developing French influence in the country.Hall, Europe and Burma, p. 62. (\\"Dupleix promised them men and munitions, but before deciding how far to commit himself he sent over his agent, the Sieur de Bruno, to Pegu.\\") He arrived at Bago, Burma in July 1751.Hall, Burma, p. 78-79. Sieur de Bruno reported back that a few hundred French troops would be able to take control of the Irrawaddy Delta, triggering an official request by Dupleix to the French court to obtain the necessary military support.Hall, Burma, p. 79.Harrison, p. 148. (\\"Soon after his arrival in 1751 the agent, Sieur de Bruno, reported back to Pondicherry that the Irrawaddy delta could easily be conquered by a small force.\\") Sieur de Bruno obtained a treatyLiang, p. 14. (\\"In July 1751, Dupleix sent Sieur de Bruno to Burma and negotiated a treaty by which, in return for commercial concessions, the Mons were to receive substantial French aid.\\") and formed an alliance between France and the Mons.Lamb, p. 64. (\\"In 1751 Dupleix sent the Sieur de Bruno to Pegu to initiate an alliance between the French and the Mon Government at Pegu against the Burmans.\\") Governor Thomas Saunders of Madras attempted to counter the French moves in the region by sending a military force to survey the island of Negrais under Captain Thomas Taylor. He also tried to negotiate the cession of Syriam to the British. The Mons firmly opposed these attempts at British encroachment under the counsel of Sieur de Bruno, who had considerable influence at the Mon court and was especially on excellent terms with the Heir Apparent. Saunders finally decided to occupy Negrais forcibly, occupying the island on 26 April 1753. However, Dupleix's proposals to take control of the Irrawaddy delta were rejected by the French government, strongly limiting his capacity to intervene there.Hall, Burma, p. 80 Participation in the Burman-Mon conflict (1751-1756) Following their 1740 revolt against Burmese rule, the Mon sacked Ava in 1752, and overran most of Burma, putting an end to the Toungoo dynasty.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, page 752, Robert McHenry, 1993: \\"Assailed from all sides, Ava fell to the Mons in 1752; and the whole of Myanmar passed under Mon rule\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1970 Page 441 \\"In 1752 they captured Ava and the Toungoo dynasty finally collapsed\\" Soon however, the Burmese were able to repeal the Mons under the leadership of Alaungpaya.Lang, p. 28. The Mons had to retreat, as Alaunpaya first recovered northern Burma, capturing the city of Ava on 14 January 1754.Hall, Burma, p. 77 By February 1755, Central Burma was secured. The Burmese soon threatened the capital of Pegu, as well as the city of Syriam. In Syriam, Sieur de Bruno was helping the Mons in organizing their defense.Hall, Burma, p. 78, 81.Hall, A History of South-east Asia, p. 382. (\\"Moreover, the Mons were aided by a brilliant Frenchman, the Sieur de Bruno, whom Dupleix had sent some years earlier to Pegu as his agent.\\") Sieur de Bruno was insistently requesting more help from Pondicherry.Hall, Burma, p. 81 He acted as a military advisor to the Mons, and French warships participated in fighting against the Burmese in Syriam and Dagon (ancient Rangoon).Findlay, p. 277 Alaungpaya on the other hand was asking the British for guns and ammunitions. Alaungpaya managed to capture Syriam in July 1756.Hall, Burma, p. 82. Sieur de Bruno and the other French with him were captured and tortured. Two French ships arriving two days after the capture of Syriam, Fleury and Galath√©e,Harvey, p. 231. with reinforcements and supplies were also captured by Alaungpaya, when Alaungpaya forced Bruno to write a letter to trick them. The French captains were killed and the 200 sailors forced to join the Burmese army Sieur de Bruno was roasted to death. From the two ships, Alaugpaya managed to put his hands on 35 ships guns (24 pounders), five field guns, 1300 muskets, and a large quantity of ammunitions. France was precluded from further intervention in Burma, with the advent of the Seven Years' War in Europe (1756-1763). French elite corps The French troops with their guns and muskets were incorporated in the Burmese army as gunners, and played a key role in the later battles between the Burmese and the Mons. They were treated well and received Burmese wives. They became an elite corps, which was to play an important role in the Burmese battles against the Siamese and the Manchus. One of them, the Chevalier Milard, was ultimately nominated Captain of the Guard and Master of the Ordnance for the Konbaung dynasty. When they reached old age, the French soldiers were able to retire Shwebo villages, with the spiritual support of a priest. To this day, some Catholic villages are still extant in the area where an awareness of some European ancestry remains.Myint-U, p. 27 Resumption of official contacts (1769) In 1769, a French embassy led by M. Feraud was sent to resume official French East India Company contacts with Burma. He obtained a trade treaty, and the establishment of a French factory in the city of Rangoon. The arrival of the embassy was facilitated by Chevalier Milard. The king of Burma Hsinbyushin welcomed Feraud's embassy,Burma: A Historical and Political Analysis, page 17 by Frank N. Trager, 1966: \\"he acknowledged the presents of their ambassador, Feraud...\\" and accepted Ferraud's offer for trade, in exchange for the supply of guns and ammunitions.James, Helen. \\"Hsinbyushin\\". In Ooi, p. 611. The king remitted a letter of agreement, which Feraud brought back to Pondicherry. Given the previous involvement of the French with the dissident Mon under Sieur de Bruno, the king of Burma clearly specified that French arm trade should involved him only.Koenig As a result of the embassy, the French obtained a large ground in Rangoon where they were able to establish warehouses.SOAS, p. 194 Franco-British rivalry (19th century) With the advent of the French revolution in 1789 and the rise of Napoleon, France became less capable of involvement in faraway theaters such as Burma. Great Britain on the contrary was able to increase its influence, leading to the First Anglo‚ÄìBurmese War (1823-1826) and the gradual extinction of Burmese sovereignty and independence. After the Second Anglo-Burmese War (1852), the British Empire annexed Lower Burma. 19th century Burmese mission to France. In 1872, king Mindon sent an embassy to Europe, led by his confidant, the Kinwun Mingyi,The United States and Burma, page 79 by John F. Cady, 1976: \\"In 1872, Mindon had dispatched a high-level diplomatic mission to Europe, headed by his confidant, the Kinwun Mingyi\\" leading to the signature of a commercial treaty with France on 24 January 1873.Chandler & Steinberg, p. 181.Burma Under British Rule--and Before, page 56 by John Nisbet, 1901 Further, in 1883, king Thibaw Min attempted to break the stalemate with Great Britain by trying to establish an alliance with France to obtain recognition and aid. This led to strong tensions between France and Great Britain. In the end, in spite of the dispatch of a Burmese mission to Paris, France refused in 1884 to sign a treaty promising that France would come to the support of Burma in case a third power would attack it, only suggesting the possibility of arm shipments from Tonkin. In 1885, the French consul M. Hass moved to Mandalay and negotiated the establishment of a French Bank in Burma, a concession for a railway from Mandalay to the northern border of British Burma and a French role in running monopolies controlled by the Burmese government. A secret treaty signed between Hass and king Thibaw was disclosed.Morrison, p. 29 The British reacted with diplomatic force. Charles Bernard, the Chief Commissioner of Lower Burma, warned that \\"if Ava refuses to stop the treaty, annexation will be inevitable\\".Myint-U, p. 188 The French government recalled Haas, who was removed allegedly \\"for reasons of health\\". While the French had backed down in Burma, the French actions as well as many other events nevertheless convinced the British to take action against Burma.Rapson et al., p. 437. (\\"What forced the English to act was that France, having won an empire in Indo-China, now tried to dominate Upper Burma by peaceful penetration.\\") Finally, the Third Anglo-Burmese War (1885), staged while France was occupied with the Sino-French war (1884-1885), resulted in the total annexation of Burma by Great Britain. With the completion of British rule in Burma, French contacts with Burma would become almost non-existent, while France would concentrate in the establishment of French Indochina from the second half of the 19th century. 20th century Following the end of World War II, ambassador-level diplomatic relationships between France and Burma were established in 1948, soon after the Burmese nation became an independent republic on 4 January 1948, as Union of Burma, with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first President and U Nu as its first Prime Minister.

Clayton is credited with playing a significant role in the post- war development of electronics in the United Kingdom.http://physicsworld.com/cws/index/print/1998 Physics World, Sep 1998, p.53 Early life He was the only son of Frank Clayton, wine merchant's assistant, and his wife, Flora, n√©e Gillbanks. His parents had a struggle to support themselves because his father, originally a clerk, had been invalided out of the services in the First World War and could seek only outdoor work. Thoughts of emigration to Canada were thwarted by his father's early death and Clayton's mother had to make a meagre living as a dressmaker. In later years he said that in effect he had been brought up by the Boy Scouts, convincing him that he could succeed by his own efforts. Clayton won two county scholarships leading to a major scholarship at Christ's College, Cambridge, specialising in physics. Career Upon graduating in 1937 he joined the General Electric Company (GEC) research laboratories, at that time one of the leading industrial research centres, to work on the company's new television receivers. In spite of the turmoil of the emerging electronics industry, for the rest of his career he remained with GEC. With the outbreak of war the GEC laboratories were soon in the forefront of radar development and Clayton's expertise was quickly applied to the development of airborne radar equipment. When the BBC resumed television service from Alexandra Palace after the war GEC won the important contract to implement the first link to another transmitter at Birmingham. This was based on Clayton's advanced proposal for a microwave radio relay. He coerced the rest of the laboratories to assist in bringing television to Birmingham on time in 1950. In 1955 GEC invited Clayton to establish its new Applied Electronics Laboratories at Stanmore to create a defence electronics capability, initially centred on developing missile guidance systems for the Royal Navy. By 1963 all the diverse GEC activities in electronics were brought together with Clayton as managing director. At this point Arnold Weinstock took control of the vulnerable GEC and with government encouragement embarked on the rationalisation of the fragmented UK electrical industry. He soon recognised that Clayton could provide the necessary technical input to his own financial acumen and in 1968 appointed Clayton technical director of the enlarged company. Clayton continued in this role, while turning his attention from streamlining the overlapping activities of the acquired companies to future ventures. However, Weinstock's growing financial caution was a limiting factor and after Clayton joined the main board in 1978 he acted mainly in an advisory role and as the technical presence of the GEC on major issues, until he retired in 1983. During the period of rationalisation of the UK electronics industry he was often perceived as a hard man who implemented Weinstock's plans. Equally, others saw him as protecting the essential research and development activities and endeavouring to move GEC into areas of future growth‚Äîoften against a company culture of short-termism. Personal life On 2 April 1949 he married Joy Kathleen (c. 1925‚Äì1997), daughter of Allan McFarlane King, an electrician, and they moved to live at Stanmore. They had no children. In his retirement ill health and blindness increasingly restricted his activities. He was widowed in 1997 when his wife died. He died at Northwick Park Hospital, Brent, on 20 June 1998. His cremation was marked only by an informal gathering of friends and the dedication of a copse of trees of the Woodland Trust. His wealth at death exceeded ¬£2 million. Honors He was a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society; an Honorary Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, becoming President in 1975; and a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, becoming President in 1982. He was also a Fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering (later the Royal Academy of Engineering) and its Vice-president for 1980‚Äì82. In 1983 he was made an Honorary Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. He was awarded a number of Honorary Doctorates, for example Honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Aston University in 1979 and City University London in 1981.http://www.city.ac.uk/about/city-information/governance/honorary- graduates/honorary-graduates-a-z Graduating at the same Aston ceremony in 1979 was Kevin Warwick, who also went on to obtain an Honorary Doctor of Science degree from Aston University. Another outcome was the invitation to join many ‚Äòquangos', including the National Enterprise Board (1978‚Äì80), the National Electronics Council (1973‚Äì83), the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee (1983‚Äì86), and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (1983‚Äì89). At various times he also served on the University Grants Committee; standing conference on schools, science & technology; the advisory council of the Science Museum; and the British Library board. His earlier work at the GEC had led to the award of an OBE (1960) and CBE (1970), and, with later contributions to public matters, a knighthood in 1980.

The film won the Golden Leopard award for the Best First Feature at the Locarno International Film Festival in 1971. Plot The director of a known car corporation invites one of his employees to his country villa to give him the good news. He just got promoted. However, the old man is not what he seems and promotion has a price. Production The screenplay of They Have Changed Their Face was written by Giulio Berruta and director Corrado Farina. They were influenced by German philosopher Herbert Marcuse, specifically his book One-Dimensional Man(1964), a critique of capitalism and communist Russia which provided the film with its thesis that consumerism is a form of social control. According to Farina, the film was very low budget, costing about 50 million Italian lire. The film was shot in Turin and Incir-DePaolis Studios in Rome between December 1970 and January 1971. Release They Have Changed Their Face was distributed by Garligiano in Italy on 2 July 1971. The film grossed a total of 28.01 million Italian lire on its domestic release. The film was released on DVD in the United States in 2014 as They've Changed Their Faces. Reception They Have Changed Their Face won the Golden Leopard award for the Best First Feature at the Locarno International Film Festival in 1971.

The University of the Philippines Manila - School of Health Sciences in Leyte (UPM - SHS) is a medical school in the Philippines supervised by the University of the Philippines, Manila. One of the schools offerings includes midwifery. History Established in 1976, the School of Health Sciences was seen as the solution to the lack and the inequitable distribution of health professionals serving rural communities in the Philippines. The school started as a two-classroom building and a small nipa hut at the Danilo Z. Romuladez Hospital (now the Eastern Visayas Medical Center) and then in 1981 transferred to its present campus at Palo, Leyte. There are two extension campuses, namely the Baler, Aurora campus opened in 2008 and Koronadal City, South Cotabato campus opened in 2010. In November 2013, during the onslaught of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the school's facilities were damaged and programs were interrupted. Help from various groups came quickly to rebuild the school. Purpose and programs The Oblation statue at the campus. The mission of UPM - SHS is to train clinically competent and socially conscious health workers who will stay and serve in depressed and underserved communities especially in the rural areas. It also has the mandate to develop a training model for the training of community oriented health workers that could be replicated in other areas of the Philippines. The school offers an innovative \\"step-ladder\\" curriculum where each student starts at a single point and exits at various levels with varying competencies, first as Community Health Worker (CHW), or Midwife then sequentially as Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), and eventually as Doctor of Medicine (MD). Admissions to this innovative program depend on the needs of the community and the desire of the student to do community work. Rural communities nominate who will be the student assigned to them.

Scouts rafting on Bert's Pool at Tolmers Scout Camp. **History of Tolmers Scout Camp and Activity Centre The land occupied by the campsite was purchased from Tolmers Park Estate in 1939, with the aim of completing a ring of Headquarters‚Äô campsites around London. The site was bought for ¬£4,600 of which ¬£2,000 was donated anonymously by a \\"Mr B\\", and the balance of ¬£2,600 came from the Gang Show fund. It was officially opened on 11 May 1940, 800 Scouts and visitors attended, despite wartime restrictions. The opening was performed by Baron Wigram, a distinguished member of the Council of the Boy Scouts Association and former private secretary to King George V. Sir Percy Winn Everett, the Deputy Chief Commissioner, read a letter from Lord Baden-Powell wishing he \\"could be there in person to support you on the opening of Tolmers\\".The Scout Magazine: June 1940 issue p.162 Almost immediately afterwards, Tolmers temporarily lost the use of the site apart from the Brick Field and the Valley Field, as it was requisitioned by the Ministry of Food. Defence works, including pill boxes, tank traps and barbed wire entanglements were constructed along Cuffley Brook, as part of the Outer London Defence Ring.https://www.northmymmshistory.uk/2018/01/fortress-hertfordshire-local- wartime.html After the war, development of Tolmers continued and all the requisitioned land was returned by the end of the 1950s. The site was very popular with Scout troops from North London who came by train to Cuffley Station, often hauling their equipment the rest of the way in trek carts. By 1970, flush toilets had been installed,Scouting Magazine, February 1971, page 84 work had started on a hut for Cub Scouts and the camp centre had moved to its present position. The original service crew were the Cuffley Rover Scout Crew, led by Ron Erwood. They were responsible for a great deal of the work in 1939-1940 prior to the official opening of the campsite. Before long, Rovers and Scouters from across North London joined them. In 1964, a system of five separate crews began, ensuring a team of volunteers was available every weekend. In 1968, the first female service crew members joined. Today, the service crew has over 100 active members. Bert Longdon, the camp warden from 1964, envisaged the creation of a small lake by damming Cuffley Brook. In 1976, a licence was granted by Thames Water Authority for the flow of the brook to be impeded \\"by means of a weir\\" and to create \\"a pond suitable for canoe instruction\\" with a capacity of 120,000 gallons.The London Gazette, 28 June 1976 Bert died in 1977 before any work could be done, but it was completed as his memorial, and the first Scouts canoed on it at Easter 1980.Scouting Magazine, July 1980, p.460 In January 1953, work started on a plantation of Scots pines in the Main Field, in the shape of the new Queen's cypher; EIIR.

Historically, much of the high country area has been grazed by sheep and cattle. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s, about 27% of New Zealand's land area was either leased or licensed from the Crown. In the South Island pastoral farming relied on Crown leasehold land. About one-fifth of the occupied land in Otago was freehold. In Canterbury, about two-fifths of occupied land was freehold. In 2006, Lincoln University lecturer Ann Brower argued that the process is in favour of the lessees rather than the government. In 2008, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment carried out an investigation into tenure review. A number of recommendations were made, including the establishment of a High Country Commission for a fixed period of time in order to address issues involving the high country.

It is the seat of the government of Hamburg and as such, the seat of one of Germany's 16 state parliaments. The Rathaus is located in the Altstadt quarter in the city center, at the Rathausmarkt square, and near the lake Binnenalster and the central station. Constructed from 1886 to 1897, the city hall still houses its original governmental functions with the office of the First Mayor of Hamburg and the meeting rooms for the Parliament and the Senate (the city's executive branch). History Floor of the parliament in 1897. After the old city hall was destroyed in the great fire of 1842, it took almost 44 years to build a new one. The present building was designed by a group of seven architects, led by Martin Haller. Construction started in 1886 and the new city hall was inaugurated in 1897. Its cost was 11 million German gold marks, about ‚Ç¨80 million. On October 26, 1897 at the official opening ceremony the First Mayor Johannes Versmann received the key of the city hall.Demizlaff, p. 35 In the postwar period, various heads of state visited Hamburg and its City Hall ‚Äî among them Emperor Haile Selassie I, the Shahanshah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1955, and in 1965 Queen Elizabeth II.

So there is a probability that there are even more rooms than the currently counted 647 rooms.Domzilaff, p. 28 Architecture Rathaus tower On the outside the architectural style is Neo- Renaissance, which is abandoned inside for several historical elements. It is one of the few completely preserved buildings of historicism in Hamburg. Built in a period of wealth and prosperity, in which the Kingdom of Prussia and its confederates defeated France in the Franco-German War and the German Empire was formed, the look of the new Hamburg Rathaus was intended to express this wealth and also the independence of the State of Hamburg and Hamburg's republican traditions. The city hall has a total area of , not including the restaurant Ratsweinkeller, now called Parlament, of . The tower is high with 436 steps. It is a common misconception that Hamburg Rathaus has more rooms than Buckingham Palace (647 vs. 775), on a building area of . The balcony is surmounted by a mosaic of Hamburg's patron goddess Hammonia, the city's coat of arms and an inscription of the city's motto in Latin: The courtyard is decorated with a Hygieia fountain. Hygieia as the goddess of health and hygiene in Greek mythology and its surrounding figures represents the power and pureness of the water. It was built in remembrance of the cholera epidemic in 1892, the former technical purpose was air cooling in the city hall. Functions The lobby is a public area used for concerts and exhibitions. It is open to the public. The emperor's hall in the first floor is the second- largest representation hall, named after Wilhelm II and functions as a room for official presentations. The mayor's hall was planned as a small meeting room. In the room as of 2008 the entry in the city's Golden Book take place, which was done by many dignitaries including the former German President Paul von Hindenburg and the Dalai Lama.

In his book Italian Horror Film Directors, Louis Paul has described Lazenby's performance as one the actor's best, although he regretted that some dubs of the film did not use Lazenby's voice. Danny Shipka, author of Perverse Titillation, compared the film stylistically to Nicolas Roeg's later film Don't Look Now, which shares a Venetian setting. Shipka noted that Lado avoided the explicit gore and sexual elements usually present in a giallo film, instead focussing on \\"an aura of uneasiness\\". Buzz McClain of AllMovie awarded Who Saw Her Die? three-and-a- half stars out of five, highlighting Lazenby's performance and Morricone's score; McClain felt that the film's plot was unnecessarily complicated, but that this was compensated for by its setting and cinematography.

He organized several expeditions to reconquer lands from the Crusaders, but never succeeded. Biography Mawdud was an officer of Muhammad I Tapar who sent him to reconquer Mosul from the rebel atabeg Jawali Saqawa. After his conquest of the city, Mehmed entrusted him with several military attempts to push back the Crusaders from the nearby Principality of Antioch and County of Edessa. The first attempt was launched in 1110; having joined forces with Ilghazi, the emir of Mardin, and of S√∂kmen el-Kutb√Æ, emir of Ahlat, they began by besieging Edessa from April of that year, but Baldwin I of Jerusalem intervened, and forced Mawdud to retreat. The following year Mawdud marched against Edessa, but as the city walls had been quickly strengthened, he preferred to lay siege to the town of Turbessel, held by Joscelin I of Courtenay. When Ridwan of Aleppo sent news that the Christians under Tancred were on the verge of capturing Aleppo, he moved on to that city. On his arrival, however, he discovered that the capture of the city was not imminent at all, and that Ridwan even refused to open the city's gates for him. He also received the news that a relief army which had been sent by Baldwin I was now marching northwards, so he raised the siege of Turbessel and the subsequent Battle of Shaizar in 1111 proved to be indecisive and a tactical draw. The 1112 campaign began again with the siege of Turbessel, but was halted when a party of the Mosul army was decimated by Joscelin on June 15. An attempt to capture Edessa with the assistance of its Armenian population was discovered by then count Baldwin II of Jerusalem, resulting in the slaughter of the Armenian participants. In 1113 Toghtekin of Damascus, tired of the ravages by the Christian forces against his territories, appealed to Mawdud to join him to invade the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The two pillaged Galilee and besieged Tiberias, though without being able to capture it. On June 28, however, the Muslims defeated King Baldwin I of Jerusalem's army at the Battle of Al-Sannabra. Reinforcements saved the Christian forces from total annihilation and prevented the Muslim commanders from exploiting the victory, and ultimately forced them to retreat to Damascus due to a lack of supplies. It was while in Damascus as a guest of Toghtekin that Mawdud was murdered by the Assassins, possibly with the knowledge of his host. He was succeeded as atabeg by Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, his representative at Baghdad.

Joint ecumenical effort In accordance with the ecumenical movement of the latter half of the 20th century, a joint ecumenical translation committee was set up in 1969 to get a new translation of the Bible, so it can be used by all Christian denominations. Interconfessional Translation Bible Its New Testament translation, called the Interconfessional Translation Bible (ÂÖ±ÂêåË®≥ËÅñÊõ∏ in Japanese, pronounced \\"Ky≈çd≈ç Yaku Seisho\\") was completed in 1978. However, for example, its local pronunciation rule of the people and place names, such as \\"Yesusu\\" (Jesus) and \\"Paurosu\\" (Paul), when used in worship, created some confusions and problems. New Interconfessional Translation Bible The committee, therefore, made necessary adjustments, such as \\"Yesu\\" (Jesus) and \\"Pauro\\" (Paul), and continued the translation work. In 1987, both Old and New Testaments were published as the New Interconfessional Translation Bible (Êñ∞ÂÖ±ÂêåË®≥ËÅñÊõ∏ in Japanese, pronounced \\"Shin Ky≈çd≈ç Yaku Seisho\\"). Original Bible texts It is a complete Bible translation, of the Old and New Testaments and the Deuterocanonical books. The original texts used are: Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia in Hebrew for the Old Testament, Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece in Greek, and the Greek Old Testament for the Deuterocanonical books. Publication Its publication is done by Japan Bible Society (Êó•Êú¨ËÅñÊõ∏Âçî‰ºö), a member of the United Bible Societies (UBS). It is published in various forms, such as the whole Old and New Testament book, Old Testament only book, New Testament only book, Old Testament with or without the Deuterocanonical books, Japanese translation with the English translation (Good News Bible (TEV) or New International Version (NIV)), with the Korean translation, etc. Use in churches It is now the most widely read Japanese Bible, by both Catholics and Protestants. It is used by Catholic churches, Anglican/Episcopal churches, Lutheran churches, United Church of Christ churches and other churches. It is not used by the Japanese Orthodox Church because they, although participated in the translation committee initially, later backed out and did not approve its use in the church. The other Japanese Bible translation often used is the New Japanese Bible (Êñ∞ÊîπË®≥ËÅñÊõ∏ in Japanese, pronounced \\"Shin Kaiyaku Seisho\\"), first published in 1970, mainly by the Evangelical Protestants. The Bible, Colloquial Japanese (Âè£Ë™ûË®≥ËÅñÊõ∏ in Japanese, pronounced \\"K≈çgo Yaku Seisho\\"), first published in 1955, is Japan's first effort to translate the Bible in compliance with the modern Japanese writing system that went into effect right after World War II and is now much less used.

Morley, ed., The Plays and Poems of William Heminge, Madison, NJ, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2006. Written in 1626 but apparently never acted in its own era, the drama was the most intensive and detailed attempt to portray Jews onstage in English Renaissance theatre. Earlier plays -- The Three Ladies of London, The Jew of Malta, The Merchant of Venice and others -- had depicted Jews with varying degrees of antipathy or sympathy, though they featured a single Jewish character, or a few at most. No dramatist before Heminges attempted to present a full cast of Jewish characters or to depict Jewish society. The prevailing anti-Semitism in England at the time makes it unsurprising that the work was not staged -- and somewhat surprising that it was ever written. Though never produced before an audience, Heminges's drama was published in 1662, under the title The Jewes Tragedy, or their fatal and final overthrow by Vespasian and Titus his son, agreeable to the authentick and famous History of Josephus. Like Heminges's other surviving play The Fatal Contract, The Jews' Tragedy was heavily influenced by the works of Shakespeare. The Jews' Tragedy is the earliest play to quote Hamlet's famous soliloquy, \\"To be or not to be.\\"Irving T. Richards, \\"The Meaning of Hamlet's Soliloquy,\\" Papers of the Modern Language Association, Vol. 48 No. 3 (September 1933), pp. 741-66. (During the Restoration, John Crowne wrote a two-part drama on the same subject, titled The Destruction of Jerusalem, acted in 1677. Crowne's play satirized the Puritans as Pharisees; it was a popular success.)

Famed Hungarian-Dutch photographer Eva Besny√∂ used a Brillant for her early work. Introduction The first Voigtl√§nder Brillant was released in 1932. This early model resembles a TLR but it is functionally closer to a box camera, since it cannot be focused in the viewfinder. It uses 'zone-focusing' for which one has to estimate the distance to the subject. To assist this estimate, three situations are marked around the taking lens: Portr√§t, Gruppe and Landschaft (i. e. Portrait, Group and Landscape). While TLRs of the same period have a rather dim ground-glass viewfinder, the Brillant has a so-called brilliant finder made of plain glass. The 1932 version has a metal body. From 1937 onwards, Brillants were made of bakelite, a polymer, and introduced an accessory compartment for an exposure meter or filters. This 1937 version is known as the Brillant V6. The next major step took place in 1938, with the introduction of the Focusing Brillant. A small opaque spot is added in the brilliant finder to focus on. The viewing and taking lens are coupled outside the body through gears. After the introduction of this focusing model, the zone-focusing models continued to be produced. Focusing and controls Pre-1938 models use zone focusing. This means there are three markings: Portrait, Group and Landscape, each supposing a standard distance or depth-of- field. A small table with the right distances is provided in the manual or inside the accessory-shoe holder. Different language versions were made for various markets; German, English (their name became Brilliant), Spanish, French, Italian, Polish and CzechoslovakThe terminology used is common to both Czech and Slovak. versions have been reported. Apart from this zone-focusing, a distance scale in meters or feet and a depth-of-field scale are provided to let the photographer make an educated guess of whether the picture will be in focus. Three shutter speeds are provided; B, 1/25 and 1/50s. The aperture can be set at 9 (full aperture), 11 and 22. The latter two are selected by rotating a punched disc between the lenses. The introduction of the Focusing Brillant added a third way of focusing: a visual focus check on a small dot of ground glass in the viewfinder.

The ship was part of a squadron commanded by George Anson and bound to attack Spanish interests in the Pacific. Wager lost contact with the squadron while rounding Cape Horn, ran aground, and wrecked on what would become known as Wager Island in May 1741. The main body of the crew mutinied against their Captain, David Cheap, abandoned him and a group of loyal crew members, and set off in a modified open boat, named 'Speedwell' via the Strait of Magellan to Portuguese administered Rio de Janeiro. On the Speedwell voyage most of the crew died from starvation, some were abandoned on shore, and a smaller boat accompanying the Speedwell disappeared in rough seas with two men aboard and was never seen again. Four Hundred miles short of Rio Grande a further eight men were abandoned on the shore whilst gathering food. Of this group three eventually made it back to England after being captured and enslaved by local Indians. The main ringleaders in the Speedwell that made it to Rio also returned to England. The group abandoned on Wager Island were re-joined a few days later by a small group from the Speedwell who were sent back in the longboat to collect some sails that were left behind. Two midshipmen, Alexander Campbell and John Byron, contrived to be part of this group after they were misled into believing that the Captain would be accompanying them in Speedwell. When the longboat failed to return, the Speedwell returned to Wager Island to look for it, but by that time everybody on the island had left in an attempt to sail north and re-join the squadron. Captain Cheap's group could not weather the cape to the north and therefore returned to Wager Island three months after they had left in a destitute condition having given up hope of escape. A few days later however a group of astonished Indians visited the island and after some negotiation in halting Spanish they agreed to guide the group north using an overland route on the mainland to Spanish inhabited Chile in return for the longboat and some guns. Most of the group died on the journey from starvation and exposure, but Cheap, Campbell, Byron and a marine officer called Hamilton survived and eventually returned to England in 1745, two years after the surviving mutineers. The adventures of the crew of the Wager were a public sensation and inspired many narratives written by survivors and others to the present day. Background and events before the wreak  HMS Wager  HMS Wager was a square-rigged sixth-rate Royal Navy ship of 28 guns. She was built as an East Indiaman in about 1734 and made two voyages to India for the East India Company before the Royal Navy purchased her in 1739. As an Indiaman she carried 30 guns and had a crew of 98.Winfield (2007), p.253. Under Captain Charles Raymond she sailed from the Downs on 13 February 1735, arriving in Madras on 18 July and returning to England via St Helena in July 1736. She made her second and final run for the company to India in 1738, sailing via the Cape of Good Hope to Madras and Bengal, and returning to the Downs on 27 August 1739.British Library: Wager (1). The Admiralty purchased Wager from Mr J. Raymond on 21 November 1739, and rated her as a 28-gun sixth rate. The Admiralty bought her to fill in a squadron under Commodore George Anson that would attack Spanish interests on the Pacific west coast of South America. Her role was to carry additional stores of small arms, ball and powder to arm shore raiding parties. It was apt that she carried the name of the principal sponsor of the voyage, Admiral Sir Charles Wager, First Lord of the Admiralty. She was fitted for naval service at Deptford Dockyard between 23 November 1739 and 23 May 1740 at a cost of ¬£7,096.2.4d and was registered as a sixth rate on 22 April 1740, being established with 120 men and 28 guns.  Commodore Anson's squadron  The squadron consisted of some 1,980 men (crew plus infantry), of whom only 188 survived the voyage. It included six warships and two victuallers (supply ships) in addition to Wager:Williams, Glyn (1999), p. 15 ::* , the flagship (a fourth-rate ship of 1,005 tons, 60 guns, and 400 men) ::* (866 tons, 50 guns, 300 men) ::* (683 tons, 50 guns, 300 men) ::* (559 tons, 40 guns, 250 men) ::* (559 tons, 24 guns, 120 men) ::* Tryal (201 tons, 8 guns, 70 men) The two merchant vessels were (400 tons, 16-men) and Industry (200 tons), and they carried additional stores. The squadron also included 470 invalids and wounded soldiers from Chelsea hospital under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Cracherode. Most of these men were the first to die during the hardships of the voyage. Their inclusion in place of regular troops was severely criticized by historian Glyn Williams as cruel and ineffective.Pack, S (1964), p. 13Williams, Glyn (1999), p.21Walter, Richard (1749) p.7Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the Western Hemisphere, 1492 to the Present, Volume 1, David Marley, p. 388  Spithead to Staten Island  North coast of Staten Island (Isla de los Estados) The squadron took 40 days to reach Funchal where they replenished supplies of water, wood, and food before making the Atlantic crossing to Santa Catarina. Two weeks into this leg of the journey, the store ship Industry signaled to the Commodore that it required to speak to him. The Captain of Industry told Anson that his contract had been fulfilled and Industry needed to turn back for England. Her stores were distributed among the remaining ships, with a large quantity of rum sent aboard Wager. Her cargo now consisted of rum, siege guns to attack fortified Spanish holds, and trading goods for use with coastal inhabitants, to be traded for supplies for the squadron and used to subvert Spanish rule. Many men in the squadron died of scurvy due to lack of fresh citrus fruits or meats. The high contingent of invalids in the squadron and the outbreak of scurvy meant that Anson's squadron was in poor condition for the arduous rounding of the Horn.Williams, Glyn (1999), p. 29 & p. 45Pack, S (1964), p. 15 Anson moved Captain Dandy Kidd from Wager to the Pearl and Captain Murray to Wager. Kidd died after the squadron left Santa Catarina and before they reached the straits of Staten Island. He allegedly made a deathbed prediction of success and riches for some, but death and devastating hardship for the crew of Wager.Williams, Glyn (1999), p. 35Pack, S (1964), p. 21 Anson now moved Captain Murray from Wager to Pearl, and he moved Lieutenant David Cheap from the small sloop Tryal and promoted him to captain of Wager. Cheap was in command of a large vessel for the first time, crewed by sick and dispirited men. He compounded these handicaps by denigrating the technical abilities of many of the officers, and being easily moved to fits of rage. He was, however, a capable seaman and navigator, a big man who feared nobody, and a loyal and determined officer.Pack, S (1964), p. 20 Anson impressed on Cheap the importance of the Wager and her role in the mission, as the squadron would draw on Wager store of small arms and ammunition to attack shore bases along the west coast of Chile.  The rounding of the Horn  Cape Horn The delays of the voyage were most keenly felt when the squadron rounded the Horn. The weather conditions were atrocious; high sea states and contrary winds meant that progress west was very slow. Added to this was the deteriorating health of the crew: because of scurvy, few able-bodied seamen were available to work the ship and carry out running repairs to the continually battered rigging.Bulkley, John; Cummins, John (1743), pp. 10‚Äì11 After many weeks working westwards to clear the Horn, the squadron turned north when navigational reckoning suggested enough westerly had been made. At this time latitudinal determination was relatively easy with the use of a sextant; however, longitudinal determination was much harder to predict: it required accurate time-pieces or a good view of the stars on stable ground, neither of which were available to the squadron. Longitude was predicted by dead reckoning, an impossible task given the storm conditions, strong currents and length of time involved. The intention was to turn north only when Anson was reasonably certain that the Horn had been cleared.Walter, Richard (1749) pp. 81‚Äì82 The result was nearly a complete disaster. In the middle of the night, the moon shone through the cloud for a few minutes, revealing to diligent sentinels aboard Anna towering waves breaking onto the Patagonian coastline. Anna fired guns and set up lights to warn the other ships of the danger. Without this sighting, the whole of Anson's squadron would have been wrecked, with the likely loss of all hands. This was a severe disappointment. The ships turned around and headed south again into huge seas and a foul wind. During one particularly severe night, Wager became separated from the rest of the squadron, and would never see it again.Pack, S (1964), pp. 30‚Äì38Williams, Glyn (1999), pp. 45‚Äì46Byron, John (1768), pp. 3‚Äì4  Events leading up to the wreak and on Wager Island   The Wreaking of the Wager  As Wager, now alone, continued beating to the west, the question being debated was when to turn north? Do it too early and the risk of running the ship aground was very high; which the crew already realized. But, they were severely depleted with scurvy ‚Äì every day more victims were going down with the condition ‚Äì and there was a shortage of seamen to handle the ship. The dilemma became contentious when Captain Cheap stated his intention to make for Socorro Island (now Guamblin Island). The gunner, John Bulkley, objected strongly to this proposal. He argued to make the secondary squadron rendezvous, the Island of Juan Fernandez, their primary destination, since it was not as close to the mainland as Socorro and was less likely to result in the wrecking the ship on a lee shore. Bulkley was recognized as probably the most capable seaman on the ship; as gunner, he had officer rank. Navigation was technically the responsibility of the master, Thomas Clark, but he, along with most of the officers on board, was held in thinly-disguised contempt by Cheap.Pack, S (1964), p. 35 Bulkley repeatedly tried to persuade Cheap to change his mind, arguing that the ship was in such poor condition that the crew's ability to carry the required sail-plan to beat off a lee-shore or come to anchor was compromised, making Cheap's decision to head for Socorro too hazardous, especially given that the whole area was poorly charted. In the event Bulkley was to prove exactly correct, but Cheap refused to change course. What Bulkley did not know was that Cheap was following his orders and it was impressed upon him that the siege guns in the hold of the Wager were required for attacking Valdivia. These orders were secret and the rumours that the Gunner perpetuated that Juan Fern√°ndez Islands should be their destination was not correct.Bulkley, John; Cummins, John (1743), pp. 12‚Äì14Pack, S (1964), p. 40Williams, Glyn (1999), pp. 38‚Äì41Byron, John (1768), pp. 4‚Äì5 On 13 May 1741, at 9 am, John Cummins, the carpenter, went forward to inspect the chain plates. Whilst there he thought he caught a fleeting glimpse of land to the west. The lieutenant, Baynes, was also on deck but he saw nothing, and the sighting was not reported. Baynes was later reprimanded at a Court Martial for failing to alert the Captain. The sighting of land to the west was thought to be impossible. But, Wager had entered a large uncharted bay, now called Golfo de Penas, and the land to the west was later to be called the Tres Montes Peninsula. At 2 pm land was positively sighted to the west and northwest. All hands were mustered to make sail and turn the ship to the southwest. During the frantic operations which followed, Cheap fell down the quarterdeck ladder and dislocated his shoulder and was confined below. There followed a night of terrible weather, with the ship in a disabled and worn-out condition, which severely hampered efforts to get her clear of the bay. At 4:30 am, the ship struck rocks repeatedly, broke her tiller, and although still afloat was partially flooded. The invalids below who were too sick to move were drowned.Bulkley, John; Cummins, John (1743), pp. 15‚Äì20Byron, John (1768), pp. 7‚Äì12 Bulkley and another seaman, John Jones, began steering the ship with sail alone towards land, but later in the morning the ship struck again, this time fast.Pack, S (1964), pp. 44‚Äì45  Shipwrecked on Wager Island  Wager struck rocks on the coast of a small, uninhabited island. Some of the crew broke into the spirit room and got drunk, armed themselves, and began looting, dressing up in officers' clothes and fighting,Pack, S (1964), p. 47 & p. 53 while 140 other men and officers took to the boats and made it safely to shore. Their prospects were desperate, as they were shipwrecked far into the southern latitudes at the start of winter with little food on a desolate island without resources to sustain them. The crew were dangerously divided, with many blaming the captain for their predicament. On Friday 15 May, the ship bilged amidships, and many of the drunken crew drowned. The only members of the crew left on board Wager were boatswain John King and a few of his followers, and King was a rebellious and difficult individual.Byron, John (1768), pp. 16‚Äì19  Mutiny  The crew of Wager were frightened and angry with their captain, and dissent and insubordination grew. King fired a four- pounder cannon from Wager at the captain's hut to induce someone to collect him and his mates once they began to fear for their safety on the wreck.Pack, S (1964), p. 54 The crew knew that they were in danger of harsh justice if they mutinied, so they worked to build a story to justify their actions. Full mutiny would likely not have occurred had the captain agreed to a plan of escape devised by Bulkley, who had the confidence of most men. He proposed that Cummins the ship's carpenter would lengthen the longboat and convert it into a schooner which could accommodate more men. They would make their way home via the Strait of Magellan to Portuguese Brazil or the British Caribbean, and then home to England. The smaller barge and cutter would accompany the schooner and be important for inshore foraging work along their journey. Bulkley was skilful enough to give the plan a chance of success. Despite much prevarication, Captain Cheap would not agree to Bulkley's plan. He preferred to head north and try to catch-up with Anson's squadron.Bulkley, John; Cummins, John (1743), p. 15‚Äì20Pack, S (1964), pp. 80‚Äì82 Cheap was in a difficult predicament. He would automatically be subject to court martial, and he could be thrown out of the Navy and into a lifetime of poverty and isolation, at best. At worst, he could be found guilty of cowardice and executed by firing squad, as demonstrated by the 1757 execution of Admiral John Byng. Cheap wanted to head north along the Chilean coast to rendezvous with Anson at Valdivia. His warrant officers had warned him against some of his actions, which would reflect badly on him when the Admiralty investigated the loss of his ship. This impasse led to the mutiny. The mutineers justified their actions based on other events, including Cheap shooting Cozens. Cheap heard an altercation outside his tent, came out in a rage, and shot Cozens in the face at point blank range without any warning. This incident further raised tensions, as Cheap refused to allow medical aid for Cozens, who took ten days to die of his wound.Pack, S (1964), p. 62 The carpenter continued modifying the boats for an undetermined plan of escape, and outright mutiny remained only a possibility so long as his work continued. Once the schooner was ready, however, events happened quickly. Bulkley set the wheels in motion by drafting the following letter for the captain to sign: > Whereas upon a General Consultation, it has been agreed to go from this > Place through the Streights of Magellan, for the coast of Brazil, in our way > for England: We do, notwithstanding, find the People separating into > Parties, which must consequently end in the Destruction of the whole Body; > and as also there have been great robberies committed on the Stores and > every Thing is now at a Stand; therefore, to prevent all future Frauds and > Animosoties, we are unanimously agreed to proceed as above-mentioned.Pack, S > (1964), p. 87‚Äì88 Baynes was presented with the letter to read, after which he said: > I cannot suppose the Captain will refuse the signing of it; but he is so > self-willed, the best step we can take, is to put him under arrest for the > killing of Mr. Cozens. In this case I will, with your approbation, assume > command. Then our affairs will be concluded to the satisfaction of the whole > company, without being any longer liable to the obstruction they now meet > from the Captain's perverseness and chicanery.Pack, S (1964), p. 88 Cheap refused to sign Bulkley's letter, and armed seamen entered his hut on 9 October and bound him, claiming that he was now their prisoner and they were taking him to England for trial for the murder of Cozens. Lieutenant Hamilton of the Marines was also confined, the mutineers fearing his resistance to their plan. Cheap was completely taken aback, having no real idea how far things had gone.Pack, S (1964), pp. 96‚Äì97 He said to Lieutenant Baynes, \\"Well 'Captain' Baynes! You will doubtless be called to account for this hereafter.\\"Pack, S (1964), p. 98  Events after the Mutiny   The voyage of the Speedwell  Satellite image of the Straits of Magellan At noon on Tuesday, 13 October 1741, the schooner, now named the Speedwell, got under sail with the cutter and barge in company. Cheap refused to go, and to the relief of the mutineers, he agreed to be left behind with two marines who were earlier shunned for stealing food. Everyone expected Cheap to die on Wager Island, making their arrival in England much easier to explain. Bulkley assumed this by writing in his journal that day, \\"this was the last I ever saw of the captain\\". In the event, both would make it back to England alive to tell their version of events, Cheap some two years after Bulkley.Byron, John (1768), p. 45 Initially the voyage got off to a bad start. After repeatedly splitting sails, the barge was sent back to Wager Island, where there were additional stores.Bulkley, John; Cummins, John (1743), p.108 Two midshipmen, John Byron and Alexander Campbell, who had been tricked into thinking Cheap would be taken home with them, quietly slipped aboard and formed part of the nine who returned. When Bulkley realised they were onboard he tried to get them to return but the barge set sail quickly and rounded the point of land whilst the schooner was at anchor. Once back at Wager Island, they were greeted by Captain Cheap, who was delighted to hear of their wish to remain with him.Byron, John (1768), p. 46 By the time Bulkley sailed back to Wager Island in search of the barge and its men, all had disappeared.Bulkley, John; Cummins, John (1743), p. 109 The Speedwell and the cutter turned around and sailed south. The journey was arduous and food was in very short supply. On 3 November the cutter parted company; this was serious as she was needed for inshore foraging work. By now Bulkley was despairing of the men in the Speedwell. Most were in the advanced stages of starvation, exposed in a desperately cold, open boat, and had lapsed into apathy. Some days later they had good news, sighting the cutter and rejoining it. Soon after, at night, she broke loose from her consort's tow line and was wrecked on the coast. Of the eighty-one men who had departed about two weeks before, ten had already perished.Bulkley, John; Cummins, John (1743), pp. 110‚Äì121 As food began to run out, the situation became desperate. Ten men were picked out and forced to sign a paper consenting to being cast ashore on the uninhabited frozen bog- ridden southern coast of Chile, a virtual death sentence. Sixty men remained in the Speedwell. Eventually the improvised vessel entered the Strait of Magellan, in monstrous seas which threatened the boat with every wave. Men were dying from starvation regularly. Some days after exiting The Straits, the boat moved closer to land in order to take in water and hunt for food. Later, as the last of their supplies were being taken on board, Bulkley made sail, abandoning eight men on the desolate shore 300 miles south of Buenos Aires. For the second time, Bulkley would abandon men to a certain death, only to confront them back in England years into the future. Three of the party he left behind, after much exertion, made it back to England alive. Only thirty- three men remained in the Speedwell.Bulkley, John; Cummins, John (1743), pp. 122‚Äì126 Eventually, and after a brief stop at a Portuguese outpost on the River Plate, where the crew were fleeced by the locals for meagre provisions and cheated by a priest who disappeared with their fowling pieces (shotguns) on the promise of returning with game,Bulkley, John; Cummins, John (1743), pp. 166‚Äì167 the Speedwell set sail once more. On 28 January 1742, it sighted the Rio Grande, southern Brazil, after a journey of over two-thousand miles in an open boat over fifteen weeks. Of the eighty-one men who set off from Wager Island, thirty arrived at Rio in a desperate condition.Bulkley, John; Cummins, John (1743), pp. 169‚Äì170  Captain Cheap's group  Title page of Byron's Book Twenty men remained on Wager Island after the departure of the Speedwell. Poor weather during October and November continued. One man died of exposure after being marooned for three days on a rock for stealing food. By December and the summer solstice, it was decided to launch the barge and the yawl and skirt up the coast 300 miles to an inhabited part of Chile. During bad weather, the yawl was overturned and lost, with the quartermaster drowned.Byron, John (1768), pp. 51‚Äì64 There was not enough room for everyone in the barge, and four of the most helpless men, all marines, were left on the shore to fend for themselves. In his account, Campbell describes events thus: ::\\"The loss of the yawl was a great misfortune to us who belonged to her (being seven in number) all our clothes, arms, etc. being lost with her. As the barge was not capable of carrying both us and her own company, being in all seventeen men, it was determined to leave four of the Marines on this desolate place. This was a melancholy thing, but necessity compelled us to it. And as we were obliged to leave some behind us, the marines were fixed on, as not being of any service on board. What made the case of these poor men the more deplorable, was the place being destitute of seal, shellfish, or anything they could possibly live upon. The captain left them arms, ammunition, a frying pan, and several other necessaries.\\"Campbell, Alexander (1747) Fourteen men were now left, all in the barge. After repeated failed attempts to round the headland, they decided to return to Wager Island and give up all hope of escape. The four stranded marines were looked for but had disappeared. Two months after leaving Wager Island, Captain Cheap's group returned. The thirteen survivors were close to death, and one man died of starvation shortly after arriving.Pack, S (1964), pp. 140‚Äì146 Back at Wager Island Captain Cheap was observed to deteriorate markedly in health with his legs swelling to twice their normal size, and he also attracted criticism in Byron's subsequent narrative for taking more food than the others but did less work. Fifteen days after returning to Wager Island, the men were visited by a party of indigenous Chono nomads led by Mart√≠n Olleta, who were astonished to find castaways there. After some negotiation, with the surgeon speaking Spanish, the Chono agreed to guide Cheap's group to a small Spanish settlement up the coast, using an overland route to avoid the peninsula. The castaways traded the barge for the journey. Iron was highly valued by the Chono as this metal was even scarce in the Spanish settlements further north. Mart√≠n Olleta led the survirors trough an unusual route across Presidente R√≠os Lake in Taitao Peninsula avoiding the common route through San Tadeo River and San Rafael Lake. In his book, John Byron gives a detailed account of the journey to the Spanish village of Castro in Chilo√© Archipelago, as does Alexander Campbell. The ordeal took four months, during which another ten men died of starvation, exhaustion and fatigue. Marine Lieutenant Hamilton, Midshipman Campbell, Midshipman Byron, and Captain Cheap were the only survivors.Byron, John (1768), pp. 71‚Äì124 Before handing over the English to Spanish authorities Mart√≠n Olleta's party stopped somewhere south of Chilo√© Island to hid all iron objects, likely to avoid have them confiscated. Scholar Ximena Urbina conjectures that Mart√≠n Olleta must have lived close to the Spanish and heard from other natives of the wreckage. Thus the rescue was not by chance but an enterprise done with prior knowledge of the Spanish interest in foreigners and of the valuable loot to be found at the wreckage.  Bulkley and the Speedwell survivors return to England  British Ambassador writes of Speedwell survivors arrival in Lisbon Baynes says he did not keep a journal as the men 'would not suffer it'. The 30 mutineers had an anxious time before eventually securing passage to Rio de Janeiro on the brigantine Saint Catherine, which set sail on Sunday 28 March 1742. Once in Rio de Janeiro, internal and external diplomatic wrangling continually threatened to terminally complicate either their lives, or at least their return to England. John King did not help. He formed a violent gang that spent most of its time repeatedly terrorising his former shipmates on various pretexts. They moved to the opposite side of Rio to avoid King. After many episodes of fleeing their accommodations in terror of King and his gang (who referred to him as their 'commander'), Bulkley, Cummins and the cooper, John Young, eventually sought protection from the Portuguese authorities. Captain Stanley Walter Croucher Pack describes these events: ::\\"As soon as the ruffians had gone [Kings gang], the terrified occupants left their house via the back wall and fled into the country. Early the next morning they called on the consul and asked for protection. He readily understood that they were all in mortal peril from the mad designs of the boatswain [King] and placed them under protection and undertook to get them on board a ship where they could work their passage.\\"Pack, S (1964), p. 167 They eventually secured passage to Bahia in the Saint Tubes, which set sail on 20 May 1742. They gladly left the boatswain John King behind to continue causing criminal havoc in Rio de Janeiro. On 11 September 1742, the Saint Tubes left Bahia bound for Lisbon, and from there they embarked in HMS Stirling Castle on 20 December bound for Spithead, England. They arrived on New Year's Day 1743, after an absence of more than two years.Pack, S (1964), pp. 167‚Äì172 Events were also reported back to London from the British Consul in Lisbon, in a dispatch dated 1 October 1742 (see images): ::\\"Last week four officers of the Wager which went out with Mr Anson, viz the Lieutenant of the ship [illegible, Bulkley?], two lieutenants of marines and four sailors arrived here in a Portuguese vessel; they say they were cast away upon an uninhabited island in the South Seas in May last twelvemonth, after they had lost their ship they lengthened their longboat and threw a deck over her in which & two open boats the whole crew being 81 in number resorted to put to sea, except their Captain who said it was as well to starve as be drowned which he was persuaded would be their fate [this is a lie]. One of the boats put back again immediately [the barge], the others proceeded, sailed the Straights of Magellan, kept along the coast 'till they got to Rio Grande, where they say they were well received by the Portuguese. But before they got there several of the people died in the voyage, others ran away there [meaning Isaac Morris and others, this is also a lie]. The rest sailed again from thence and went to Rio de Janeiro, what numbers landed there they do not remember. The whole event the Lieutenant [Baynes] says must be very important for [Page 2] the sailors were become masters and would not suffer him to keep a journal. When they got to the Rio de Janeiro there were lots of their companions who left them at Rio Grande had been there & were gone away in His Majesty's ship commanded by Captain Smith who sailed for the West Indies seven or eight days before they got in. The officers gone home of this Packet [HMS Stirling Castle] & the sailors are put on board His Majesty's ship the Greyhound.\\"Records assembled by the State Paper Office [National Archives SP 89/42] Stanley Walter Croucher Pack's book describes a similar report: ::\\"Arrival of some of the castaways from the loss of H.M.S. Wager in the South Pacific. Were well treated by Portuguese at Rio de Janeiro, but sailors were mutinous against their officers. King of Portugal has had another seizure and his departure for Caldas is postponed... etc.\\"Records assembled by the State Paper Office SP 89/42 Lieutenant Baynes, in order to exonerate himself, rushed ahead of Bulkley and Cummins to the Admiralty in London and gave an account of what happened to Wager which reflected badly on Bulkley and Cummins but not himself. Baynes was a weak man and an incompetent officer, as was recorded by all those who provided a narrative of these events. As a result of Baynes' report, Bulkley and Cummins were detained aboard HMS Stirling Castle for two weeks whilst the Admiralty decided how to act. It was eventually decided to release them and defer any formal court martial proceedings until the return of either Commodore Anson or Captain Cheap. When Anson did return in 1744, it was decided that no trial would proceed until Cheap returned. Bulkley asked the Admiralty for permission to publish his journal. It responded that it was his business and he could do as he liked. He released a book containing his journal, but the initial reaction from some was that he should be hanged as a mutineer.Pack, S (1964), p. 222 Bulkley found employment when he assumed command of a forty-gun privateer Saphire. It was not long before Bulkley's competence and nerve found him success as he tricked his way around a superior force of French frigates which his vessel encountered when cruising. As a result, Bulkley found his successes being reported in popular London papers and gained some celebrity. He began thinking that it would not be long before the Admiralty would offer him the coveted command of a Royal Navy ship. On 9 April 1745, however, Cheap arrived back in England.Pack, S (1964), p. 223  Survivors of Captain Cheap's group return to England  By January 1742 (January 1743 in modern calendar, the year changed on 25 March in those days), as Bulkley was returning to Spithead, the four survivors of Cheap's group had spent seven months in Chacao. Nominal prisoners of the local governor, they were allowed to live with local hosts and were left unmolested. The biggest obstacle in Byron's efforts to return to England began firstly with the old lady who initially looked after him (and her two daughters) in the countryside before his move to the town itself. All of the ladies were fond of Byron and became extremely reluctant to let him leave, successfully getting the governor to agree to Byron staying with her for a few extra weeks. He finally left for Chacao, amidst many tears.Byron, John (1768), p. 146 Once in Chacao, Byron was also offered the hand in marriage of the richest heiress in the town. Her beau said, although \\"her person was good, she could not be called a regular beauty\\", and this seems to have sealed her fate.Byron, John (1768), p.147 On 2 January 1743, the group left on a ship bound for Valpara√≠so. Cheap and Hamilton removed to Santiago, as they were officers who had preserved their commissions. Byron and Campbell were unceremoniously jailed.Byron, John (1768), p. 155 Campbell and Byron were confined in a single cell infested with insects and placed on a starvation diet. Many locals visited their cell, paying officials for the privilege of looking at the 'terrible Englishmen', people they had heard much about, but never seen before. But, the harsh conditions moved not only their curious visitors but also the sentry at their cell door, who allowed food and money to be taken to them. Eventually Cheap's whole group made it to Santiago, where things were much better. They stayed there on parole for the rest of 1743 and 1744. Exactly why becomes clearer in Campbell's account: ::\\"The Spaniards are very proud, and dress extremely gay; particularly the women, who spend a great deal of money upon their persons and houses. They are a good sort of people, and very courteous to strangers. Their women are also fond of gentlemen from other countries, and of other nations.\\" After two years, the group were offered passage on a ship to Spain; they all agreed, except Campbell. He chose to travel overland with some Spanish naval officers to Buenos Aires and from there to connect to a different ship also bound for Spain. Campbell deeply resented Captain Cheap's giving him less money in a cash allowance than he gave to Hamilton and Byron.British Consul, Lisbon \\"A Castres, Lisbon. Requests payment for a bill drawn by Captain David Cheap late of the Wager\\" ADM 106/988/106 Campbell was suspected to be edging toward marrying a Spanish colonial woman, which was against the rules of the British Navy at that time. Campbell was furious at this treatment. He wrote: ::\\"...the misunderstanding between me and the Captain, as already related, and since which we had not conversed together, induced me not to go home in the same ship with a man who had used me so ill; but rather to embark in a Spanish man-of-war then lying at Buenos Aires.\\" On 20 December 1744, Cheap, Hamilton and Byron embarked on the French ship Lys,Byron, John (1768), p. 176Pack, S (1964), p. 206 which had to return to Valparaiso after springing a leak. On 1 March 1744 (modern 1745) Lys set out for Europe, and after a good passage round the Horn, she dropped anchor in Tobago in late June 1745. After managing to get lost and sail obliviously by night through the very dangerous island chain between Grenada and St Vincent, the ship headed for Puerto Rico. The crew was alarmed at seeing abandoned barrels from British warships, as Britain was now at war with France. After narrowly avoiding being captured off San Domingo, the ship made her way to Brest, arriving on 31 October 1744. After six months in Brest being virtually abandoned with no money, shelter, food or clothing, the destitute group embarked for England on a Dutch ship. On 9 April 1745 they landed at Dover, three men of the twenty who had left in the barge with Cheap on 15 December 1741.Byron, John (1768), p. 189Pack, S (1964), p. 211 News of their arrival quickly spread to the Admiralty and Buckley. Cheap went directly to the Admiralty in London with his version of events. A court martial was duly organised. After all he had been through and survived, Bulkley was in danger for his life, and at risk of execution.  Abandoned survivors of the Speedwell group return to England  Left by Bulkley at Freshwater Bay, in the place where today stands the resort city of Mar del Plata,Vignati, Milc√≠ades Alejo (1956), p.86Bulkeley, John; Cummins, John; Byron, John; Gurney, Alan (2004) p. 237 were eight men who were alone, starving, sickly and in a hostile and remote country. After a month of living on seals killed with stones to preserve ball and powder, the group began the 300-mile trek north to Buenos Aires. Their greatest fear, correctly as it would transpire, were the Tehuelche nomads, who were known to transit through the region. After a 60-mile trek north in two days, they were forced to return to Freshwater Bay because they were unable to locate any water resources. Once back they decided to wait for the wet season before making another attempt. By autumn they were starving for lack of food. They became more settled in Freshwater Bay, built a hut, tamed some puppies they took from a wild dog, and began raising pigs. One of the party spotted what they described as a 'tiger' reconnoitering their hut one night. Another sighting of a 'lion' shortly after this had the men hastily planning another attempt to walk to Buenos Aires (they actually saw a jaguar and a cougar).Pack, S (1964), pp. 190‚Äì193 One day, when most of the men were out hunting, the group returned to find the two left behind to mind the camp had beenback murdered, the hut torn down, and all their possessions taken. Two other men who were hunting in another area disappeared, and their dogs made their way back to the devastated camp. The four remaining men left Freshwater Bay for Buenos Aires, accompanied by 16 dogs and two pigs. They eventually reached the mouth of the River Plate, but, unable to negotiate the marshes on the shores of Samborombon Bay, the party was forced to make their way back to Freshwater Bay. Shortly afterwards a large group of Tehuelches on horseback surrounded them, took them all prisoner, and enslaved them. After being bought and sold four times, they were eventually taken before Cangapol, a chieftain who led a loose confederation of nomad tribes dwelling between the rivers Negro and Lujan. When he learned they were English and at war with the Spanish, he treated them better. By the end of 1743, after eight months as slaves, they eventually told the chief that they wanted to return to Buenos Aires. Cangapol agreed but refused to give up John Duck, who was mulatto. An English trader in Montevideo, upon hearing of their plight, put up the ransom of $270 for the other three and they were released. On arrival in Buenos Aires, the Spanish governor put them in jail after they refused to convert to Catholicism. In early 1745 they were moved to the ship Asia, where they were to work as prisoners of war. After this they were thrown in prison again, chained, and placed on a bread and water diet for fourteen weeks, before a judge eventually ordered their release. Then Midshipman Alexander Campbell, another of Wager crew, arrived in town.Pack, S (1964), pp. 194‚Äì198Byron, John; Morris, Isaac (1913)Morris, Isaac (1751)  Midshipman Alexander Campbell's overland trek to Buenos Aires  On 20 January 1745 Alexander Campbell and four Spanish naval officers set out across South America from Valparaiso to Buenos Aires. Using mules, the party trekked into the high Andes, where they faced precipitous mountains, severe cold and, at times, serious altitude sickness. First a mule slipped on an exposed path and was dashed onto rocks far below, then two mules froze to death on a particularly horrendous night of blizzards, and an additional 20 died of thirst or starvation on the remaining journey. After seven weeks travelling, the party eventually arrived in Buenos Aires.Pack, S (1964), p. 213  Campbell and the Freshwater Bay survivors return to England  It took five months for Alexander Campbell to get out of Buenos Aires, where he was twice confined in a fort for periods of several weeks. Eventually the governor sent him to Montevideo, which was just 100 miles across the R√≠o de la Plata. It was here that the three Freshwater Bay survivors, Midshipman Isaac Morris, Seaman Samuel Cooper and John Andrews were languishing as prisoners of war aboard the Spanish ship Asia, along with sixteen other English sailors from another ship. Campbell had finally converted to Catholicism, which helped him. While his fellow shipmates were treated harshly and confined aboard the Asia, Campbell wined and dined with various captains on the social circuit of Montevideo.Pack, S (1964), p. 214 All four Wager survivors departed for Spain in the Asia at the end of October 1745, but the passage was not without incident. Having been at sea three days, eleven Indian crew on board mutinied against their barbaric treatment by the Spanish officers. They killed twenty Spaniards and wounded another twenty before briefly taking control of the ship (which had a total crew of over five hundred). Eventually the Spaniards worked to reassert control and through a 'lucky shot', according to Morris, they killed the Indian chief Orellana. His followers all jumped overboard rather than submit to Spanish retribution.Pack, S (1964), pp. 217‚Äì218 The Asia dropped anchor at the port Corcubion, near Cape Finisterre on 20 January 1746. The authorities chained together Morris, Cooper and Andrews and put them in jail. Campbell went to Madrid for questioning. After four months held captive in awful conditions, the three Freshwater Bay survivors were eventually released to Portugal, from where they sailed for England, arriving in London on 5 July 1746. Bulkley had to confront men he assumed had died on a desolated coastline thousands of miles away.Pack, S (1964), p. 219 Campbell's insistence that he had not entered the service of the Spanish Navy, as Cheap and Byron had believed, was apparently confirmed when he arrived in London during early May 1746, shortly after Cheap. Campbell went straight to the Admiralty, where he was promptly dismissed from the service for his change in religion. His hatred for Cheap had, if anything, intensified. After all he had been through, he completes his account of this incredible story thus: ::\\"Most of the hardships I suffered in following the fortunes of Captain Cheap were the consequence of my voluntary attachment to that gentleman. In reward for this the Captain has approved himself the greatest Enemy I have in the world. His ungenerous Usage of me forced me to quit his Company, and embark for Europe in a Spanish ship rather than a French one.\\"  Court martial into the loss of Wager  Proceedings for a full court martial to inquire into the loss of Wager were initiated once Cheap had returned and made his report to the Admiralty. All Wager survivors were ordered to report aboard HMS Prince George at Spithead for the court martial. Bulkley on hearing this reacted in his typical style of being overly clever and devious. He arranged to dine with the Deputy Marshal of the Admiralty (the enforcing officer of the Royal Navy command) but kept his true identity concealed. Bulkley wrote about his prepared conversation with the Deputy Marshal at the Paul's Head Tavern in Cateaton Street: ::\\"Desiring to know his opinion in regard to the Officers of the Wager, as their Captain was come home; for that I had a near relation which was an Officer that came in the long-boat from Brazil, and it would give me concern if he would suffer: His answer was that he believ'd that we should be hang'd. To which I replied, for God's Sake for what, for not being drown'd? And is a Murderer at last come home to their Accuser? I have carefully perused the Journal, and can't conceive that they have been guilty of Piracy, Mutiny, nor any Thing else to deserve it. It looks to me as if their Adversaries have taken up arms against the Power of the Almighty, for delivering them.\\"Pack, S (1964), p. 224 At which point the Marshal responded: ::\\"Sir, they have been guilty of such things to Captain Cheap whilst a Prisoner, that I believe the Gunner and Carpenter will be hang'd if no Body else.\\" Bulkley told the Marshal of his true identity, who immediately arrested him. Upon arrival aboard Prince George, Bulkley sent some of his friends to visit Cheap to gauge his mood and intentions. Their report gave Bulkley little comfort. Cheap was in a vindictive frame of mind, telling them: ::Gentlemen, I have nothing to say for nor against Villains, until the Day of Tryal, and then it is not in my Power to be off from hanging them.\\"Pack, S (1964), p. 225 Upon securing the main players, trial was set for Tuesday 15 April 1746, presided by Vice Admiral of the Red Squadron James Steuart. Much of what happened on the day land was first sighted off Patagonia as recounted here came out in sworn testimonies, with statements from Cheap, Byron, Hamilton, Bulkley, Cummins and King (who had also returned to England, under unknown circumstances) and a number of other crew members. Cheap, although keen to charge those who abandoned him in the Speedwell with mutiny, decided not to make any accusations when it was suggested to him that any such claims would lead to his being accused of murdering Midshipman Cozens. None of the witnesses was aware at this point that the Admiralty had decided not to examine events after the ship foundered as part of the scope of the court martial proceedings. After testimony and questioning, the men were all were promptly acquitted of any wrongdoing, except for Lieutenant Baynes. He was admonished for not reporting the carpenter's sighting of land to the west to the captain, or letting go the anchor when ordered.  Aftermath  The mutineers argued that, since their pay stopped on the day their vessel was wrecked, they were no longer under naval law. Captain Stanley Walter Croucher Pack, in his book about the mutiny, describes this and the Admiralty's decision not to investigate events after the Wager was lost in more detail: ::\\"Their Lordships knew that a conviction of mutiny would be unpopular with the country. Things were bad with the Navy in April 1746. Their Lordships were out of favour. One of the reasons for this was their harsh treatment of Admiral Vernon, a popular figure with the public... The defence that the Mutineers had was that as their wages automatically stopped when the ship was lost, they were no longer under naval law. Existence of such a misconception could lead, in time of enemy action or other hazard, to anticipation that the ship was already lost. Anson realised the danger and corrected this misconception. As Lord Commissioner he removed any further doubt in 1747. An Act was passed \\"for extending the discipline of the Navy to crews of his majesty's ships, wrecked lost or taken, and continuing to receive wages upon certain conditions... The survivors of the Wager were extremely lucky not to be convicted of mutiny and owe their acquittal not only to the unpopularity of the Board, but to the strength of public opinion, to the fact that their miraculous escapes had captured the public fancy.\\"Pack, S (1964), p. 246 Captain Cheap was promoted to the distinguished rank of post captain and appointed to command the forty-gun ship , demonstrating that the Admiralty considered his many faults secondary to his steadfast loyalty and sense of purpose. He captured a valuable prize soon after, which allowed him to marry in 1748. He died in 1752. His service records, reports, will and death are recorded in the National Archives.Admiralty Service Records, David Cheap, 1st Lieutenant ADM 6/15/209Admiralty Archive: Will of Captain David Cheap PROB 11/797 Midshipman John Byron was promoted to the rank of master and commander, and appointed to command the twenty-gun ship Syren. He eventually rose to the rank of vice admiral. Byron had a varied and significant active service history which included a circumnavigation of the globe. He married in 1748 and raised a family. His grandson George Gordon Byron became a famous poet. He died in 1786. Robert Baynes' service records exist from prior to the sailing of Anson's squadron.Admiralty Service Records: Robert Baynes, Lieutenant ADM 6/15/218 Upon his return to England after the Wager affair, he never served at sea again. Instead, in February 1745, before the court martial, he was given a position onshore running a naval store yard in Clay near the Sea, Norfolk.Robert Baynes \\"takes charge of the Rye's stores on the orders of George Goldsworth\\" ADM 106/1003/52 Apart from some reports of thieving from his yard, his life did not create other records.Robert Baynes, \\"Robert Baynes, men charged with thieving from his yard\\" ADM 106/1003/141 He remained in this capacity until his death in 1758.Robert Baynes, Records of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury PROB 31/416/337Robert Baynes, death recorded by Admiralty ADM 354/160/116 Shortly after the court martial, John Bulkley was offered command of the cutter Royal George, which he declined, thinking her \\"too small to keep to the sea\\". He was right in his assessment, as the vessel subsequently foundered in the Bay of Biscay, with the loss of all hands.Pack, S (1964), p.244 Alexander Campbell completes his narrative of the Wager affair by denying he had entered the service of the Spanish Navy; however, in the same year his book was published, a report was made against him. Commodore Edward Legge (formerly captain of in Anson's original squadron) reported that whilst cruising in Portuguese waters, he encountered a certain Alexander Campbell in port, formerly of the Royal Navy and the , enlisting English seamen and sending them overland to Cadiz to join the Spanish service.Williams, Glyn (1999), pp.101‚Äì102 Further reading * John Bulkeley & John Cummins: A Voyage to the South-Seas, in the Years 1740-1: Containing a Faithful Narrative of the Loss of His Majesty's Ship the Wager on a Desolate Island.

He won 14 caps for Wales in union, and five caps for Wales in rugby league, and was the first player to tour Australia and New Zealand for both union, and league British teams. Morley, although mainly a wing player was often used as a utility back, and was known for his incredible pace and ability to change direction at speed. He was an intelligent but unorthodox player. Club career Morley first represented Wales as a schoolboy, and after leaving Newport Municipal Secondary School he joined Newport. In his first season with the club he scored 29 tries, and by 1931 was captain of the senior Newport team, at the age of 21 he was the youngest player to be given the honour.Billot (1974), p. 136. He captained Newport against the touring South Africans at Rodney Parade on 8 October 1931, and set up Ken Richards for a try after a typical zigzag run. The South Africans took note of Morley and attempted to ensure he wasn't given the space to run at them for the rest of the game.Billot (1974), p. 137. In August 1932 he switched to rugby league, leaving Newport for Wigan. Championship Final appearances Jack Morley played , i.e. number 2, and scored a try in Wigan's 15‚Äì3 victory over Salford in the Championship Final during the 1933‚Äì34 season at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on Saturday 28 April 1934 . County Cup Final appearances Jack Morley played , i.e. number 2, in Wigan's 10‚Äì7 victory over Salford in the 1938‚Äì39 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1938‚Äì39 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 22 October 1938. Notable tour matches Jack Morley played , i.e. number 2, and scored 2-tries in Wigan's 30‚Äì27 victory over France at Central Park, Wigan, on Saturday 10 March 1934. International career Morley was first capped for Wales against England on 19 January 1929 and although he finished on the losing side he did manage to score a try on his d√©but, when he received the ball forty yards out, broke infield and crossed wide, after cutting back inside to score.Godwin (1984), p. 173. He retained his place and played in the remaining three games of the Championship. After playing in two matches of the 1930 tournament, he played in all four matches of Wales's Championship winning 1932 campaign. Morley scored in all but one of the matches, surprisingly the game he failed to score was against France, when Wales were rampant and his team mates scored seven tries. Morley was capped 14 times for Wales and his final game was against Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park in 1932. He would probably have been chosen for future teams as he was still a young exciting player, but his decision to join a professional league side made him ineligible for future Welsh games.

The National Library of Latvia was formed in 1919 after the independent Republic of Latvia was proclaimed in 1918. The first supervisor of the Library was JƒÅnis Misi≈Ü≈°, a librarian and the founder of the Latvian scientific bibliography (1862‚Äì1945). The current building was designed in 1989 by noted Latvian-American architect Gunnar Birkerts (1925-2017), who emigrated to the United States and made his career there. It was constructed in the early 21st century and opened in 2014. Today the Library plays an important role in the development of Latvia's information society, providing Internet access to residents and supporting research and lifelong education. The historical main building, Kri≈°jƒÅ≈Üa Barona iela 14  History  Interwar period The National Library was founded on 29 August 1919, one year after independence, as the State Library (Valsts Bibliotƒìka). Its first chief librarian and bibliographer was JƒÅnis Misi≈Ü≈° (1862-1944), who made his immense private collection the basis of the new library. Within a year, until 1920, the stocks had grown to 250,000 volumes. Starting in the same year, all publishers were obliged to hand in a deposit copy of their works. Since 1927, the Library has published the National Bibliography of Latvia. There were significant additions in 1939 and 1940, when the State Library took over many of the libraries and collections of the Baltic Germans. Most resettled to the Nazi German Reich. Among these collections was a large part of the collection of the Society for History and Archaeology of Russia's Baltic Provinces, est. 1834, the primary historical society of the Baltic Germans. In 1940, holdings encompassed 1.7 million volumes, so that they had to be stored in two different locations in the Old Town (Jƒìkaba iela 6/8 and AnglikƒÅ≈Üu iela 5). German and Soviet occupation During World War II, Germany invaded Latvia and occupied Riga (1941-1944). At that time, German authorities renamed the State Library as Country Library (Zemes bibliotƒìka), eliminating reference to a sovereign Latvian state). Following the war, Latvia was under Soviet rule, and the institution was known as State Library of the Latvian SSR (Latvijas PSR Valsts bibliotƒìka). According to Soviet customs, in 1966 the library received an honorary name, commemorating Vilis LƒÅcis, a writer and the late prime minister of Soviet Latvia. From 1946, literature deemed 'dangerous' from the Soviet perspective was withdrawn from the shelves and until 1988, when the Soviet Union gave up control, could be accessed only with a special permit. In 1956, the State Library moved into a new building at Kri≈°jƒÅ≈Üa Barona iela. Renewed independence Since the reestablishment of Lativan national independence in 1991, the institution has been called National Library of Latvia. In 1995, it received as a permanent loan the Baltic Central Library of Otto Bong (1918-2006), a collection pertaining to the history, regional studies and languages of the Baltic countries. In 2006, the National Library joined the European Library online service.  Collections  The Library's holdings today encompass more than 5 million titles, incl. about 18,000 manuscripts from the 14th century up to modern times. One of the characteristic cornerstones of the NLL, which characterizes every national library, is the formation of the collection of national literature, its eternal storage and long-term access. The NLL is a centre of theoretical research and practical analyses of the activities of Latvian libraries. The Library carries out the functions of the centre of Latvia Interlibrary Loan, ensures the library and information service to the Parliament of the Republic of Latvia ‚Äì the Saeima, implements the standardisation of the branch. Since the very outset, its main concern has been the national bibliography. The massive union catalogue Seniespiedumi latvie≈°u valodƒÅ (Ancient Prints in Latvian 1525‚Äì1855, published in Riga, 1999) received the Spƒ´dola Prize in 2000 and was awarded The Beautiful Book of the Year 99. In 2005, the Letonikas grƒÅmatu autoru rƒÅdƒ´tƒÅjs (1523-1919) (Index of the Authors of Lettonica Books (1523‚Äì1919)) was published, providing information about versatile branches of science and representatives of various nations, Latvia being the main focus of their publications. The NLL includes several collections of posters (artists Oskars ≈†teinbergs (1882‚Äì1937), Sigismunds Vidbergs (1890‚Äì1970), Raoul Dufy (1877‚Äì1953), Bernhard Borchert (1863‚Äì1945), NiklƒÅvs Strunke (1894‚Äì1966) and others). Lettonica Digitising collections at the NLL started in 1999. At present the Latvian National Digital Library Letonica, which was formed in 2006, holds digitized collections of newspapers, pictures, maps, books, sheet-music and audio recordings. In 2008 NLL launched two major digital projects. Periodika.lv is the NLL's collection of digitized historical periodicals in Latvian with the possibility to read full texts and search page by page. Latvia has a tradition of Song and Dance Festivals organized every four years. The historical materials from the first Song Festival in 1864 till the Latgale Song Festival in 1940 can be explored in another digital collection of the National Library of Latvia.  New building  Interior of the library Conference hall Ziedonis St. Peter's Church An amphora-shaped sculpture in front of the library. The surface of the sculpture is covered in letters. The first discussions about the need for a new National Library began as early as 1928, and the significance of the project of this century was confirmed by high-level international recognition of the value of its collections. In 1999 almost all 170 UNESCO member states adopted a resolution during its General Conference, calling on member states and the international community to ensure all possible support for the implementation of the NLL project. The continuous growth of the Library had made it necessary to transfer parts of the stocks into other buildings. By NLL had its holdings distributed among five locations in Riga. Furthermore, since 1998, some stocks had to be stored in a depot in Silakrogs outside the capital. The Parliament finally authorized a new building to be constructed on the left bank of the Daugava River. On 15 May 2008, after discussions lasting for many years, the state agency Three New Brothers and the Union of National Construction Companies signed the contract on the construction of the new National Library of Latvia. On 18 May 2014, the main facility of the Library at Kri≈°jƒÅ≈Üa Barona iela was closed for the move. In 2008, construction started according to the design of noted Latvian- American architect Gunnar Birkerts, who had been based in the Detroit, Michigan area since the early 1950s. He had been commissioned to design the building in 1989. He was inspired by the Glass Mountain of Latvian mythology. The new building has 13 floors and is 68 m high. Construction costs were given as 193 million euros. 480 people work there. As part of Riga's programme for its title as European Capital of Culture, selected holdings were symbolically carried from the old to the new building by a human chain on 18 January 2014. The new building was finally opened on 29 August that year, the Library's 95th anniversary. Today the NLL building is a dominant landmark on the Riga cityscape. It has space for conferences and conventions, and other community events. Among others, it hosted the 4th summit of the EU's Eastern Partnership programme in May 2015, and a debate chaired by the BBC's Jonathan Dimbleby on 14 March 2016.BBC World Service report, 14 March 2016 Current projects *LIBER 43rd Annual Conference *Development of the digital library services *Dissemination and Exploitation via Libraries: for Success and Sustainability of LLP Results *Effective training tools application to qualification improvement in library sector (ETQI) *Europeana Awareness *Europeana Inside *Europeana Newspapers *Europeana Sounds *The Exhibition \\"Book 1514‚Äì2014\\" and Academic readings \\"Content of the 21st Century\\" *The Impact of Digital text and Multimedia Format on Childhood Learning: a Multidimensional Approach See also *List of national libraries *Latvian ISBN Agency  References   External links  * Official site of the National Library of Latvia * Project of the new building of the NLL * Friends of the National Library of Latvia * National Library of Latvia at Google Cultural Institute * Message to the future readers * Live from the construction site * World Wide Science Library buildings completed in 1919 Buildings and structures in Riga Latvian culture Latvia Latvian digital libraries 1919 establishments in Latvia Libraries established in 1919 Deposit libraries Libraries in Latvia ","title":"National Library of Latvia"},{"id":"19113950","text":"Alan Morris (15 July 1954 ‚Äì 31 December 1998) was an English footballer.

John Zosimus, also known as Ioane-Zosime (; died c. 990) was the 10th-century Georgian Christian monk, religious writer, and calligrapher known for his liturgical compilations and the hymns dedicated to the Georgian language. Biographical details on Ioane-Zosime are scarce beyond the fact that he was one of the numerous expatriate Georgian clerics active at the monastery of Mar Saba in Palestine from where he moved, probably fleeing the Arab rule, to Mount Sinai early in the 970s. His voluminous body of work dates from between 949 and 987. Of the three surviving manuscripts of Ioane-Zosime's Mar-Saba period, two ‚Äì the collections of hymns of 949 and 954 ‚Äì are the most important. On Mt. Sinai, Ioane-Zosime principally engaged in bookbinding, collating and copying. In his hymnographic compilations and chronologic treatises, Ioane-Zosime provides a detailed list of sources as well as an encyclopedically organized calendar of saint's feast days and the chronology of the Georgian liturgy. He also collected obsolete texts which he frequently cites, comparing usage in different ecclesiastical centers and distinguishing Georgian from Greek sources. One of his anthologies of chants ends with Ioane- Zosime's \\"testament\\" written as an elaborate acrostic hymn in which reading the first and last letter of each stanza gives us the name of St. George.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History, pp. 32-33.

Furthermore, Ioane-Zosime imbues the Georgian language with religious connotation as the tongue to be used on the Judgment Day.Rapp, Stephen H.

In fluid dynamics, the Ursell number indicates the nonlinearity of long surface gravity waves on a fluid layer.

The Ursell number is derived from the Stokes wave expansion, a perturbation series for nonlinear periodic waves, in the long- wave limit of shallow water ‚Äì when the wavelength is much larger than the water depth. Then the Ursell number U is defined as: :U, =, frac{H}{h} left(frac{lambda}{h}right)^2, =, frac{H, lambda^2}{h^3}, which is, apart from a constant 3 / (32 œÄ2), the ratio of the amplitudes of the second- order to the first-order term in the free surface elevation.Dingemans (1997), Part 1, ¬ß2.8.1, pp. 182‚Äì184.

As a result, libertarians seek to maximize autonomy and freedom of choice, emphasizing political freedom, voluntary association and the primacy of individual judgment.

It can be found in geographically widespread sites around the British Isles and in the Mediterranean Sea. It has five arms, is about 1.5 cm across and is of a green colour with central brown markings.Asterina phylactica, habitas.org.uk, accessed 31 August 2008 The species was formally described in 1979 and is very similar to Asterina gibbosa. Description Asterina phylactica is a pentagonal starfish with short blunt arms and a flattened shape. It grows to a diameter of about and is olive-green with a central brown star-shaped marking, a pale underside, and a clear cut edge between the upper and lower surfaces. It can be distinguished from the closely related Asterina gibbosa by the fact that it has fewer plates surrounding its mouth, its smaller size and its characteristic colouring. At one time the two were believed to be the same species but it was realised in 1979 that besides the differences in appearance, the two occupied different ecological niches and had different reproductive methods. Distribution and habitat Asterina phylactica is native to the northwestern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. Around the British Isles, Asterina phylactica is found around the south-west coasts but also occurs on the west coasts of Scotland and north-west Ireland. In Wales, the typical habitat for this species is rock pools on exposed coasts with much encrusting coralline algae. It is a tolerant species and able to adapt to a range of different salinities and temperatures. Biology Asterina phylactica feeds on the film of bacteria and diatoms that exists on the surface of rocks. To do this it everts its stomach and presses it against the rock before secreting digestive enzymes. In their first year, individuals of Asterina phylactica are all males but in the following year they become hermaphrodite and produce both sperm and eggs. The breeding season is late spring and several individuals come together in a group. Sperm is liberated into the sea and the eggs are fertilised. The developing embryos are retained under the starfish where they are brooded for about three weeks. The eggs have direct development and metamorphose into juvenile starfish which crawl out from under their mother and disperse. The lifespan is probably about two years as females normally die after they have brooded their young.

It had its origins in an August 2002 meeting of 15 political parties that had failed to reach the electoral threshold in the 1999 legislative election to qualify for the subsequent election. The idea was that the parties would band together to establish a new party. However, this proved impossible because of differences such as religion and ideologies. Three parties soon dropped out, then another two but driven by the desire to take part in the next election, the remaining ten formed an alliance. By the time the Bogor Political Memorandum was signed on 24 November 2002 only eight parties remained. The following month, the new party was founded. In the 2004 legislative election, the Indonesian Unity Party won 0.6% of the popular vote and no seats. After initially failing to qualify, following a lawsuit, the party won the right to contest the 2009 elections, in which it won only 0.14 percent of the vote and no seats.

Career Liverpool/Tranmere Rovers In the early days of Barnett's career, he played for Liverpool Youth side, with whom he won the FA Youth Cup in 2006 and 2007, before being released by the club, having never made an appearance for the side. Barnett then moved to League One side Tranmere Rovers on a one‚Äìyear contract on 1 August 2008, signing his first professional contract in the process. Barnett made his d√©but for Tranmere Rovers away to Swindon Town, in the 3‚Äì1 defeat in League One on 9 August 2008. However, he spent two months on the substitute bench, due to manager Ronnie Moore's decision to \\"inject greater defensive discipline into the midfield\\". His handful of reserve appearances led Moore to recall him to the first team. It wasn't until on 24 October 2008 when Barnett made his first team appearances for the first time in two months, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Crewe Alexandra. He then appeared in a handful of first team appearances for the side. He scored his first goal with a volley in the 1‚Äì1 draw to Peterborough United on 17 February 2009. Barnett later scored two more goals later in the season, scoring a vital goal in the derby against Oldham Athletic, when he volleyed in the opening goal of the game in the 2‚Äì0 win for Tranmere Rovers on 21 March 2009, and adding his third goal at home to Hereford United in Tranmere's 2‚Äì1 win on 13 April 2009. For his performance, he was named the club's Young player of the season. At the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Barnett went on to make thirty‚Äìthree appearances and scoring three times in all competitions. On 17 July 2009, he signed a new one-year contract at Tranmere Rovers, ending speculation over a potential transfer move. However, in the 2009‚Äì10 season, he found himself out of the first team, due to a groin injury and appeared in the substitute bench. As a result, Barnett played in the club's reserve for the side. His first appearance of the season came on 25 August 2009, coming on as a substitute in the 65th minutes, in a 1‚Äì0 loss against Bolton Wanderers in the second round of the League Cup. However, he received a straight red card for \\"a lunge on Neil Austin\\", in a 1‚Äì0 loss against Hartlepool United on 24 October 2009. After being suspended for three matches, Barnett scored on his return, in a 2‚Äì1 loss against Leyton Orient on 21 November 2009. Following this, he spent the rest of the season on the substitute bench and only made four more appearances for the side. At the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, where Barnett made nine appearances and scoring once for the side, he was released by the club. Accrington Stanley In summer 2010, Barnett was on trial with Scottish First Division side Falkirk and assisted one of the goals in the Bairns' 2-1 friendly win over Northwich Victoria but failed to win a contract, citing the club's finance. Instead, he joined Accrington Stanley on a twelve-month contract on 4 August 2010. Upon joining the club, Barnett was given a number eight shirt for the side. Barnett made his Accrington Stanley debut on 7 August 2010 in the opening match of the season against Aldershot Town. Since making his debut for the club, he quickly became a first team regular for the side, playing in the midfield position. It wasn't until on 2 October 2010 when Barnett scored his first goal for the club, as well as, setting up one of the goals, in a 7‚Äì4 win over Gillingham. His performance was praised by Manager John Coleman, though he believed that Barnett need to work on his fitness. He then set up two goals, in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Chesterfield on 3 January 2011. The following month on 22 February 2011, Barnett scored his second goal for the club, in a 3‚Äì2 win over Crewe Alexandra. Despite suffering injuries during the 2010‚Äì11 season, Barnett went on to make forty‚Äìtwo appearances and scoring two times in all competitions for the side. Reflecting the season, he said: \\"The amount of pressure and stress he works under and the squad he's managed to get together, he's done a really good job.\\" In the 2011‚Äì12 season, Barnett signed a one‚Äìyear contract with the club on 25 July 2011. He continued to be in the first team regular for the side, playing in the midfield position. But he was sent‚Äìoff for a professional foul in the 43rd minute for a challenge on Steve Kabba, in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Barnet on 3 September 2011. After serving a three match ban, Barnett returned from suspension, coming on as late substitute, in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Oxford United on 24 September 2011. In a follow‚Äìup match against Aldershot Town on 1 October 2011, he scored his first goal of the season, in a 3‚Äì2 win. Seven days later on 8 October 2011, Barnett helped the side by setting up two goals to come from 2-0 down with 10 men to claim a point, in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Plymouth Argyle. Over the season, he, at one point, played in the right‚Äìback position. Barnett said about the new position, saying: \\"The gaffer has played me a bit further forward in the last few games and I've managed to be at the heart of a lot of things we've done well, which is a massive positive for me. I am happy playing there so that's a massive plus for me if I do stay.\\" At the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Barnett went on to make forty‚Äìfour appearances and scoring once in all competitions. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, Barnett signed a one‚Äìyear contract extension with the club.

The film was an episode of the French documentary film series Cin√©astes de notre temps (Filmmakers of our time), which in over ninety episodes since 1966 concentrates on individual film directors, film people and film movements. The title of the film is a play on the title of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's novella One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. Plot The film combines clips from Tarkovsky's films with footage of Tarkovsky on the set of his last film The Sacrifice and on his deathbed, during the final stage of his battle with cancer. The film mostly relies on images, with only sparse commentary, and concentrates mainly on giving insight into Tarkovsky's work and philosophy and on exploring the intersections between his private life and his work. The film starts with a scene from Tarkovsky first film Ivan's Childhood and ends with a parallel scene from his last film The Sacrifice. It shows the reunion of Tarkovsky with his son Andrei Jr., who had been allowed to leave the Soviet Union only after Tarkovsky was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Apart from Andrei Tarkovsky himself the film shows, among others, his second wife Larisa Tarkovskaya, his son Andrei Jr., the editor of the film The Sacrifice Michal Leszczylowski, the French actress Val√©rie Mairesse, the Swedish cinematographer Sven Nykvist and the Russian actress Margarita Terekhova. Release The film was first shown on the Franco-German TV channel Arte on 17 May 2000. The film was screened at the 2000 Telluride Film Festival, the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival, the 2000 San Francisco International Film Festival, the 2000 Berlin International Film Festival and the 2001 Doubletake Documentary Film Festival. The film was also screened at the Santa Fe Film Festival in 2000 and won the best documentary award. On June 21, 2011, Icarus Films released One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich on home video.http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s3564life.html Included on the disc, alongside the film, are two short films about contemporary Russia: Three Songs About The Motherland by Marina Goldovskaya, and In the Dark by Sergey Dvortsevoy.http://alternativechronicle.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/one-day-in- the-life-of-andrei/ Critical reception Although not widely distributed, the film received very positive reviews. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader writes that One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich is \\"the best single piece of Tarkovsky criticism I know of, clarifying the overall coherence of his oeuvre while leaving all the principal mysteries in the films intact.\\" whereas J. Hoberman of the Village Voice called the film \\"a brilliant appreciation of the last great Soviet director, Andrei Tarkovsky\\". Other documentaries about Tarkovsky  Several dozen other documentaries about Andrei Tarkovsky have been produced. Most notable are Voyage in Time by Tonino Guerra and Andrei Tarkovsky himself, Moscow Elegy by Alexander Sokurov, The Recall by Tarkovsky's son Andrei Jr., and Regi Andrej Tarkovskij by Michal Leszczylowski, the editor of Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice.

It was originally developed for the FM Towns, and also ported for the Sega Mega-CD, Amiga CD32, 3DO, and MS-DOS. Microcosm featured realistic FMV animation, with the graphics being rendered on Silicon Graphics workstations. The game is either in first person or third person view depending on the gaming system. Plot Set in the year of 2051 AD, the game takes place in a dystopian futuristic setting on an alien planet called Bodor, located in the Bator System, where the galaxy's two largest conglomerates ‚Äî Cybertech, considered the more compassionate of the two, and Axiom, thought to be the more oppressive corporation ‚Äî compete to achieve premier status in the business world, a position known as CORP 1. Because of heavy mining operations on the planet from the corporations, most of Bodor is uninhabitable due to pollution, forcing 87% of the population onto 2% of the planet's land. Because of this, poverty, crime and disease are rampant in the cities. Axiom also claims that Cybertech is responsible for the death of Axiom's former president. Axiom injects Cybertech president Tiron Korsby's body with microscopic droids designed to penetrate his brain and control his mind. Cybertech, however, learns of this plan and injects Korsby with their own piloted submarines shrunken down to a microscopic size to destroy Axiom's droids and prevent them from controlling Korsby's mind. Development The game used the latest Silicon Graphics computers at the time to render the graphics as realistically as possible. In 1991, the game was first seen in a demo for the Amiga CDTV. A port for the CD-i was planned and then canceled, but a prototype exists. The lead platform was the FM Towns, and development was funded in part by Fujitsu with the aim of making it a launch title for the console-styled version of the platform, the FM Towns Marty. The game engine was later purchased by Fujitsu for ¬£250,000. The DOS and FM Towns versions feature an exclusive soundtrack by Rick Wakeman, which was replaced in other versions with a soundtrack by Tim Wright for licensing reasons. A promotional version of the game was later developed for Pfizer. Reception Critics generally rated Microcosm as having excellent graphics but very limited and poorly designed gameplay. Amiga Format, for instance, greatly praised the Amiga CD32 version's graphics and soundtrack, but described the gameplay as \\"a merely slightly better than average\\" rail shooter. In a 1995 second review, they lowered their score from 87% to 40%, mocking their earlier review's emphasis of graphics over gameplay and describing the game as \\"a decidedly average Space Harrier clone that certainly looks great, but plays horribly\\". Amiga Power similarly described Microcosm as a Space Harrier clone with extremely limited interactivity and little variations in the visuals, giving the game a 44%. CU Amiga gave the Amiga CD32 version an 86%, saying that the graphics are not nearly as good as the FM Towns version, with enemy sprites that look \\"pasted on\\", but that the gameplay is considerably improved. Reviewing the Sega CD version, GamePro opined that Microcosm represents a good concept for FMV games, but that the poor level design reduces the gameplay to trial-and-error and takes away the fun. Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly commented that the game concept is good, but the gameplay is \\"repetitious and boring.\\" They scored it a 5.4 out of 10. Computer Gaming World in June 1994 said that the DOS version was \\"a very basic shooter\\" with \\"simplistic, even brainless\\" gameplay. While praising the \\"polished graphics and animation\\" and \\"equally excellent\\" music, the magazine concluded that despite \\"cool technology and a 'cinematic feel' ... Psygnosis forgot to make a game\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly's four reviewers gave the 3DO version a unanimous score of 4 out of 10, commenting that the graphics are a huge improvement over the Sega CD version.Though the FM Towns and Amiga CD32 versions had also been released at the time, the review does not mention them because they were not released in North America, where Electronic Gaming Monthly was published, but that the gameplay is still shallow and \\"just not fun\\". Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"This is one of those games one can never describe as challenging, only as frustrating.\\" Editions The limited edition copy of the PC and Amiga CD32 versions of the game contains the game, the manual, a soundtrack CD and a T-shirt.

It was founded in 1773 by the Quaker physician and philanthropist Dr John Coakley Lettsome for physicians, surgeons and apothecaries who met to exchange medical news and confer about difficult cases. Lettsome himself served as president of the new society in 1775‚Äì1776, 1784‚Äì1785, 1809‚Äì1811 and 1813‚Äì1815. James Sims was president from 1786 to 1808 and during his long term of office some members of the society, led by Sir William Saunders, became so offended by his autocratic style that in 1805 they formed themselves into a new medical society, the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London, which later evolved into the Royal Society of Medicine. The Society's wide appeal, the possession of a valuable library (originally purchased from Sims) and freehold property (donated by Lettsome) has helped to ensure the society's success and longevity. Originally based in the City of London, it moved in 1873 to its present location in Lettsom House, Chandos Street, near Cavendish Square in the heart of London's medical community. This early 19th-century building was originally owned by the Earl of Gainsborough, and is now also home to several related societies who share the facilities.Postgrad Med J 2004;80:350-354 P. Hunting (2004) \\"History of Medicine: The Medical Society of London\\" The library has since been purchased by the Wellcome Trust. The Lettsomian lecture is delivered annually by a fellow of the society. The Fothergill gold medal, named in honour of physician John Fothergill, Lettsome's patron, is awarded every three years in consultation with the Royal College of Physicians (to be awarded every five years from 2010). The present prize, founded in 1824, is funded by the will of Anthony Fothergill and prior to 1888 was awarded annually. The original award, sponsored by Lettsome, was introduced in 1787 and awarded until 1803.

White conflorescences with 6-18 flowers appear in the leaf axils in spring. The fruit grow on a short stalk are ovate or obliquely ovate long by wide with a short beak. Taxonomy and naming Hakea ulicina was first formally described by Robert Brown in Supplementum primum prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae in 1830, based on plant material collected by William Baxter in Wilsons Promontory. Named from the Latin ulex for the genus of plants which includes furze (Ulex europaeus), and believed to be a resemblance to the habit or the leaves of this species. Distribution and habitat Furze hakea occurs on the southern slopes of the Great Dividing Range as well as in coastal heathland. It is mostly found from the east of Port Phillip Bay in Victoria through to Eden in south-eastern New South Wales. Additional populations occur in the Brisbane Ranges and Anglesea to the west of Port Phillip Bay, as well as Tasmania's Furneaux Group of islands. A similar species from South Australia and western Victoria, Hakea repullulans, can be distinguished by its broader leaves and presence of a lignotuber.

It is a harbour on the northern shore of the Fehmarn Belt. A ferry service connects R√∏dbyhavn with Puttgarden on the island of Fehmarn. Thus one can drive or take the train from Copenhagen over the Fehmarn Belt, and on to L√ºbeck and Hamburg by European route E47, which in Germany is known as autobahn A1 or Vogelfluglinie.

The dyke had been constructed in 1872 following storm floods, and on its outer side, at Syltholm, a harbour for fishing and commerce was opened in 1912. With the emergence of a new settlement to support the activities of the harbour, the name of Syltholm was changed to \\"R√∏dbyhavn\\". 1916 saw the construction of a first shipyard, but by the 1920s, the shipbuilding business at R√∏dbyhavn ran into bankruptcy, and activity in the harbour stagnated. In 1920, the harbour installations were expanded on the landward side. In 1941, work began to prepare for the expansion of the harbour in order to support a ferry connection between R√∏dbyhavn and Puttgarden. The work came to a halt during the immediate post-war years, but was resumed in 1958. Finally, on 14 May 1963, the \\"Vogelfluglinie\\" ferry connection was inaugurated. The resulting transport boom created jobs and drew in immigrants, and the population of R√∏dbyhavn more than doubled. Economy Codan Medical Aps has a factory on F√¶rgevej 4.

It is engraved on eighteen plates, and survives in fourteen known copies. It is the first of Blake's Continental prophecies.Blake Archive page Background During autumn 1790, Blake moved to Lambeth, Surrey (today within the bounds of Greater London). He had a studio at the new house that he used while writing what were later called his \\"Lambeth Books\\", which included America in 1793. Like the others under the title, all aspects of the work, including the composition of the designs, the printing of them, the colouring of them, and the selling of them, happened at his home.Bentley 2003 pp.122-124 America was the first book printed by Blake to include the place of origin and Blake's full name on the title page, which showed that Blake would continue to expound his visions of revolution even though parliament had passed acts against seditious writings earlier that year.Damon 1988 p. 20 Blake wrote in his notebook \\"I say I shan't live five years. And if I live one it will be a Wonder. June 1793\\". Early sketches for America were also included in this notebook, which Blake used between 1790 and 1793.Bentley 2003 p. 142 While early drafts of America mentioned King George III by name, Blake scrupulously avoided this in the final draft, referring to him as \\"the King of England\\", or other synonyms. Only a few of Blake's works were fully coloured,Bentley 2003 p. 158 and America was one of the few works that Blake describes as \\"illuminated printing\\", those of which were either hand coloured or colour printed with the ink being placed on the copperplate before printed.Bentley 2003 pp. 149‚Äì150 There were 17 copies of America created with 4 of them coloured. The work contained 18 plates,Bentley 2003 p. 140 and were 23 x 17 cm in size. The lines of poetry included in the work were organized into septenaries.Bentley 2003 p. 312 Henry Crabb Robinson contacted William Upcott on 19 April 1810 inquiring about copies of Blake's works that were in his possession. On that day, Robinson was allowed access to Europe and America and created a transcription of the works.Bentley 2003 p. 338 In plate 8 (copy A) Orc, spirit of revolution, arises. \\"The grave is burst, the spices shed, the linen wrapped up\\" Poem The image A Breach in a City served as the frontispiece for America and was originally shown on its own at the Royal Academy during April 1784. The work was probably based on the Gordon riots at Newgate Prison during June 1780.Bentley 2003 pp. 91-92 The implications of the work are taken up again in America with the King of England trembling as he sees Orc, the embodiment of the American colonies. The Angel of Albion believes Orc is the Anti-Christ and Orc believes the King of England is the same. This is followed by Orc's apocalyptic vision:Bentley 2003 pp. 138-139 Orc provokes the Angel of Boston to rebellion:Bentley 2003 p. 139 Together, the rebels are able to be freed of the psychological chains that bind them: The frontispiece to America a Prophecy (Copy A) Themes America, like many of Blake's other works, is a mythological narrative and is considered a \\"prophecy\\". However, only America and Europe were ever given that title by Blake. His understanding of the word was not to denote a description of the future but to describe the view of the honest and the wise.Bentley 2003 p. 130 America was also the first book that Blake titled a Prophecy. This change indicates that he was no longer dramatizing history, as in The French Revolution, but instead \\"recording the formula of all revolution\\". For that reason the events of the revolution are portrayed without regard for chronological order: the governors meet at the house of Sir Francis Bernard (who had been recalled in 1769), the 37-year-old King George is described as having \\"aged limbs\\", and other episodes are compressed or out of order.Damon 1988 pp. 20-21 In regards to the prophetic works, the character Oothoon represented America in Visions of the Daughters of Albion and she is raped by the character Bromion. The book represents her as trapped by a philosophical system created by John Locke, and no one is able to hear her pleas except for the daughters of Albion. The implications of the work are taken up again in America with the King of England trembling as he witnesses Orc and the rebelling colonies. Although there is a vision of rebellion, there is no actual freedom at the end of the poem just as in the Visions of the Daughters of Albion.Bentley 2003 pp. 137-140 Unlike the Visions of the Daughters of Albion, America, as well as Europe, describes nations that are trying to determine their own destiny instead of individuals trying to deal with theirs.Bentley 2003 p. 152 The Song of Los is connected to both America and Europe in that it describes Africa and Asia, which operate as a sort of frame to the other works. As such, the three works are united by the same historical and social themes.Bentley 2003 p. 154 When Blake describes pity becoming a trade along with generosity becoming a science, it is possible that he is referring to how a Parish School of Industry at Golden Square transformed from a school that educated students in manual labour to a factory system in which the students were producing goods for sale after 1786.Bentley 2003 p. 90 Other political aspects of the work include Blake's portrayal of Thomas Paine as a defender of liberty in regards to Paine's Rights of Man.Bentley 2003 p. 112 Furthermore, the image of the English prince being a dragon figure is connected to a literary tradition of heroes slaying a dragon that has tyrannised a country. Likewise, in Biblical and apocalyptic tradition, the dragon is defeated by the Messiah. As such, the image in America a Prophecy is that the rebellion is a natural struggle for freedom against oppression and a renewal of society. It is part of a natural cycle.Frye 1990 p. 209 In other regards, the work deals with the oppression of the mind, with the dragon being representative of this repression. The \\"Ancient of Days\\", represented in America a Prophecy by Urizen, who is like Zeus, Jehovah and other leaders of gods, is the creator of religion. He is old in a mentally frail manner as well as cruel. Urizen is represented as white, which is connected to snow, colourlessness, atheism and the unknown. He is always an abstraction, Orc, on the other hand, is the representation of revolution, along with blood, rage and passion. The polarity of the characters and their contest is connected to the Ossian poem Carric-Thura, which describes the old and cruel god Loda being attacked by the hero Fingal, who drives the god away. However, both characters are interconnected, with Orc being the force of new life in the cycle and Urizen representing the older version of Orc that dies at the end of the cycle.Frye 1990 pp. 209‚Äì210 Blake had many expectations for the American Revolution, which is described in a prophetic way within the poem. However, he was disappointed when the fallen state of existence returned and that slavery was not immediately ended. He was also disappointed when there was not a sensual liberation. After Napoleon Bonaparte declared himself Emperor in 1804, Blake believed that the Americans would start treating George Washington as their god-king in the manner that the French treated Bonaparte and the British monarch George III. He continued to believe in an apocalyptic state that would soon appear, but he no longer believed that Orc man, the leader of a revolution, would be the agent of the apocalypse. Instead, he believed that God could only exist in men, and he distrusted all hero worship.Frye 1990 pp. 216‚Äì217 Critical response Allan Cunningham believed that the work was \\"plentifully seasoned with verse\\".Bentley 2003 qtd. p. 140 Henry Crabb Robinson believed the work to be obscure.Bentley 2003 p. 140 J. T. Smith was confused by the \\"expressions,\\" which \\"are mystical in a very high degree,\\" but thought the poem's designs were \\"very fine\\".Bentley 2003 qtd. p. 140 Alexander Gilchrist remarked that \\"Turning over the leaves it is sometimes like an increase of light on the retina, so fair and open is the effect of particular pages\\".Damon 1988 qtd. p. 21 Notes References * Bentley, G.

Tsum valley lies in Gorkha district and comprises two remote villages called Chumchet and Chhekampar. The name ‚ÄòTsum‚Äô came from the Tibetan word called ‚ÄòTsombo‚Äô, which means vivid. Traditionally Tsum valley was a very distinct place geographically and culturally therefore was called ‚ÄòTsum Tso Chuksums‚Äô, which means thirteen provinces ruled as a single territory. This land is so unexplored that many religious and archeological relics are still intact at many places in Tsum. People in Tsum Valley still practise polyandry system and they have unique culture, tradition and a dialect of their own. Their unique festivals observed here are Lhosar, Dhacyhang, Saka Dawa, Faning among others. The residents of Tsum valley are called Tsumbas. Many of the claimed sightings or encounters with Mehti, more commonly referred as the ‚ÄòYeti‚Äô, have come from Tsumbas. The valley occupies an area of about 1663 km2. The lowest point of Tsum Valley trek is Lhokpa (1905 m) and the highest is Ngula Dhojhyang Pass (over 5093 m) on the Tibetan border. The Hidden Valley is surrounded by the Baudha Himal and Himal Chuli to the west, Ganesh Himal to the south, and Sringi Himal to the North.

Long became one of Australia's most successful and popular country and folk artists in the 1960s, releasing over a dozen albums for EMI. He was also well known for his acting appearances on television programs such as Homicide.  Early life  Lionel Long was born in Burwood, New South Wales and grew up in Bondi. with his mother Aileen and father Ernest who was an accomplished violinist. He went to Christian Brothers School where he was an A grade student and won many scholarships to continue his education. On completion of his high school years, Lionel decided to go and work as a jackaroo in the Hunter Valley and then into the expansive outback of Queensland, where he also honed his skills in singing and playing guitar. Lionel returned with his family to Sydney, where he attended Hawkesbury Agricultural College, studying commercial art and marine biology. He learned to play the guitar with his long-time friend Gary Shearston. Both young men had a fondness for country and folk music and shared song verses at the Long family home at Rose Bay It is here where the idea arrived, to pen their book 'Australian Bush Songs'.  Career  While studying at Hawkesbury Agricultural College, Long's musical talent was recognised by Ron Wills of EMI Columbia and he was signed to the music label. Wills had previously produced the breakthrough Australian country hit \\"Pub With No Beer\\" by Slim Dusty and had also signed Frank Ifield to the label. Long's friend Gary Shearston also went on to fame, recording on the CBS records label. The 1950s and early 1960s saw folk music become popular in Australia with the success of American folk revivalists such as the Weavers and the Kingston Trio and, later, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Peter Paul and Mary. The Australian folk music scene's popularity was aided by the international success of the Australian group the Seekers. Australian musicians and producers started to research and rediscover Australian folk music from the 18th and 19th centuries, such as \\"Botany Bay\\", \\"Bound For South Australia\\" and the most famous of all Australian folk songs, \\"Waltzing Matilda\\". It was this folk music revival that made EMI Columbia insist that Long move away from his love of country music and record folk music. In 1958, Long released his first singles. Through the EMI Columbia label, he released almost a dozen albums from 1961 to 1970, meeting critical acclaim and becoming Australia's most popular performer of traditional \\"bush music\\". After his first LP in 1961, Waltzing Matilda, and his second in 1962, Wild Colonial Boy, Long had established himself as a household name. In 1963, he released his third LP, The Bold Bushrangers: Songs of Wild Colonial Days, which featured Australian artist Sidney Nolan's Ned Kelly on the sleeve. In 1964, he was presented with a gold record by EMI Records for his first LP Waltzing Matilda. Many of Long's albums featured accompaniment by other musicians, including Dave Guard of the Kingston Trio (who emigrated to Australia in the early 1960s), guitarist and teacher Don Andrews and jazz legend Don Burrows.  Television  During the 1960s, Long's profile was boosted by appearances on many TV shows, including the Channel 9 music program Bandstand. In 1962, the rocker Johnny O'Keefe suffered a breakdown after disagreements with the producers of his Johnny O'Keefe Show. While O'Keefe convalesced, Long took over as host of the show, retitled Sing Sing Sing, for a year. Soon after O'Keefe returned to host the show in early 1963, Long's popularity was so strong that he was given his own TV program titled Music Time, which aired for a year. Around this time, Long married Carole Newgrosh. In 1964, Lionel Long released another LP, this time not entirely Australian folk songs, Songs of the Sea. This album was dedicated to Lionel's early memories of fishing off the coast of New South Wales near Port Macquarie and his boyhood adventure of trying to sail from Sydney to Newcastle (130 km) in a rubber dinghy at the age of 10. Lionel was a keen sailor, having owned boats and spent much time sailing and fishing with friends, many of whom were famous recording artists in their own right. Lionel Long appeared on TV again on 1 August 1964, as one of the stars of This Is It, a show to inaugurate Channel 0, the for-running of Network 10, Melbourne's third commercial TV station. Lionel Long was also an acting teacher in the early 1980s for children and teenagers, who worked from firstly a church hall in Bankstown, New South Wales, with actress Erica Watson (who was later featured in the mini-series The Day of the Roses played by Gigi Edgley) as his assistant coach. The acting class featured in Simon Townsend's Wonder World, interviewed by Sheridan Jobbins, in late 1982. Long moved his acting school to the inner city of Sydney in 1984, working also with adults for the next few years in the Stanislavski Method of acting.  Film  Having dabbled in acting on TV since 1961 (Whiplash and Riptide), Lionel went to London in 1964 for a cameo appearance in The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders, starring Kim Novak in the title role. Lionel Long played the father (Charles Dawson) role in the Australian 1976 Columbia feature film Barney, also starring Spike Milligan and Sean Kramer directed by David Waddington. Lionel chose to live in New York to complete his studies in the Stanislavski Method of Acting, at The Studio of Acting, with critically acclaimed teacher Stella Adler, alongside greats such as Melanie Griffith and Tom Waits. Adler also produced alumni such as Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Salma Hayek, and Mark Ruffalo. On completion of Lionel's studies and honing a true lifelong respect and friendship with Stella, he returned to Australia. Long taught the Stanislavsky method at his own Actors Studio's, within his various campuses based around Sydney. Lionel arranged for his students to travel to Los Angeles once a year to practice and learn more about the actor's craft with a range of selected teachers. Lionel also organised for up and coming screenwriters to spend time with well known Hollywood Screenwriters to discuss intricate screenwriting techniques, editing and scriptwriting for screen. Lionel spent part of his time in Los Angeles, teaching the Stanislavsky Method by invitation from the AFTRA in Los Angeles, for students in the USA, who further wanted to develop their understanding and application of the method. Lionel Long, at this time, was also selected to be on the voting panel for the Academy Awards.  Return to music  Long Ago: Folk Songs of the British Isles was Lionel Long's 1965 album, and featured him playing a custom-made 6-string lute he purchased in the UK. A photograph of Lionel with his 6-string lute featured on the album cover for this LP and two later ones. A Sunburnt Country was Lionel's next album, which returned to Australiana, its title taken from Dorothea Mackellar's famous poem My Country which featured on the LP as a spoken track. Banjo Paterson's The Man from Snowy River also featured as a spoken track. In 1966, Lionel Long's next album was Amberwren and Other Folk Songs. His 1967 release Lionel Long Today included the song Follow the Wind, an unrecorded Bee Gees song. Homicide Long's best-known TV role came in 1968 when he appeared on police procedural program Homicide as Detective Bert Costello. His character was planned for only a few episodes, but Lionel's popularity was so great that he remained on the hit show all season and appeared in 49 episodes between 1968 and 1969. His character was eventually killed in a mine collapse. Following his success on Homicide, Lionel Long appeared on other Crawford Productions and other programs. His TV credits include: * The Link Men (1970) * The Rovers (1970) * Matlock Police (1971 and 1974) * Division 4 (1972) * Spyforce (1972) * Solo One (1976) * Chopper Squad (1978) * A Country Practice (1986) His film roles include: * Inn of the Damned (1975) * Barney (1976).  Final albums  In 1970, Lionel Long released one more album on the EMI Columbia label, Close Up, before signing with RCA and releasing four folk music albums, The Man From Snowy River, Australia! Australia!, Brandied Plums and The Best of Lionel Long. He also released several singles on RCA. Lionel Long re-signed with EMI in 1980 and released his final album, High, Wild and Handsome, which featured guitarist Tommy Emmanuel, a version of \\"Let It Be\\" by the Beatles and the well-known Kermit the Frog song \\"Rainbow Connection\\". Lionel also displayed visual artistic talents, producing illustrations for several books and guides. Lionel performed his music well into the 1980s, appearing at the Sydney Opera House in 1987 and travelling to Nashville, Tennessee, to work with the LeGarde Twins on various recording deals. Medal of the Order of Australia Lionel Long was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia Medal (OAM) in the 1993 Australia Day honours, with the citation, \\"for service to the performing and visual arts\\". Death Lionel Long died on 1 January 1998 at Sacred Heart Hospital in Darlinghurst, Sydney. He was cremated after a small service at the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park in Matraville, Sydney. Stonybrook  Lionel Long's vineyard homestead was owned and managed for 10 years under the name Stonybrook by advertising creative Matthew Batten. Batten maintained a collection of Lionel Long memorabilia, including a distinctive country-style chair which was hand-painted by Lionel in a folk art style and was donated by his Daughter Amberwren, in the homestead property when Batten purchased it. Batten sold the property privately in 2014.

Family  He was born in Harrow, North London, in 1893 and was the eldest child of Herbert William Bryans and his wife, Louisa Bryans, n√©e Richardson. He had a younger sister, Katherine, born in 1895, and a younger brother, George, born in 1896. By 1901, the family lived at Regent's Park, London.1901 Census of Great Britain He was educated at Eton College.  Attempts at diplomacy  Background Ulrich von Hassell, a German diplomat who served as ambassador to Italy from 1932 to 1938, had emerged as one of the leaders of the conservative opposition to the Nazi regime. During the Phoney War, Hassell sought an \\"assurance\\" from Britain that an \\"honorable peace\\" would be obtainable for a post-Nazi German government. Lonsdale-Bryans, described to Hassell as \\"an English associate of Lord Halifax\\", was prominent in the high society of Rome and had let it be known that he was willing to serve as an amateur diplomat. Lonsdale-Bryans had moved to Rome in October 1939 and, in November 1939 first met Count Detalmo Biroli. In his 1951 book The Blind Victory, Lonsdale-Bryans wrote of his \\"self-appointed mission\\" as \\"winning the peace\\" and \\"saving millions of lives\\", but the German historian Gregor Sch√∂llgen described Lonsdale-Bryans's real motives as seeking fame and money via his \\"often eccentric\\" attempts at playing diplomat. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had invested much hope that German conservatives would persuade the Wehrmacht to overthrow Hitler before the fighting started in Western Europe. Biroli was an Italian aristocrat who knew Lonsdale-Bryans through several mutual friends in Rome and had married Hassell's daughter, Fey, in 1939. On 28 December 1939, Biroli gave Lonsdale-Bryans an unsigned letter of the \\"peace terms\\" sought by the conservative opposition in Germany. After meeting Biroli and his wife Fey at least 40 times, in January 1940, Lonsdale-Bryans went to London to meet Lord Halifax. Initially, Halifax refused to see him, but Lonsdale-Bryans's patron, Lord Brocket, was able to arrange a meeting at the Foreign Office on 8 January 1940. It was agreed that Lonsdale-Bryans would meet Hassell and carry a written message from him back to London. Halifax agreed to the mission if that his name was not mentioned, and he instructed Sir Percy Loraine, the British ambassador in Rome, to assist Lonsdale-Bryans, but in the same cable, Halifax wrote that Lonsdale-Bryans \\"is clearly a lightweight and has, not of course, been sent on any mission by me\\". Meeting with Hassell Upon returning to Rome, he contacted Biroli to set up a meeting with Hassell, which turned out to be difficult since Hassell was paranoid that the Gestapo and/or the OVRA would be following him if he met Lonsdale-Bryans in Rome. In 1940, Lonsdale-Bryans travelled to Switzerland to meet Hassell, the former German ambassador to Italy. On 22 February 1940, Lonsdale-Bryans met Hassell in Arosa. Halifax had claimed that Longsdale- Bryans was not a representative of the British government, but Lonsdale-Bryans introduced himself to Hassell as the \\"English Envoy Extraordinary (if not plenipotentiary) of the First Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for His Britannic Majesty\\". Hassell believed that Lonsdale-Bryans had more authority than in reality. Hassell refused to name for whom he was speaking but promised that any message from Halifax would reach the \\"right people\\" in Germany. Hassell told Lonsdale-Bryans that much of the Wehrmacht's Generalit√§t was willing to revolt against Hitler if Britain would make \\"assurances\\" for a \\"honorable peace\\". Hassell also said that Britain should not publicly call for Hitler's overthrow and that it was imperative for the call for a \\"change of regime\\" in Germany not to be seen to come from \\"non-German sources\\". Hassell argued that most Germans still remembered what had happened in 1918, when US President Woodrow Wilson made it clear that the United States would never sign an armistice with the Kaiser, Wilhelm II, which led to what Hassell called the terrible situation in Germany \\"after the Kaiser was sacrificed\\". A conservative monarchist, Hassell stated the restoration of the monarchy in Germany was \\"very desirable, but only a question at the secondary stage\\". Much of what Hassell had to say concerned his fear that \\"a Bolshevistion of Europe is rapidly growing\\". He cited the Soviet aggression against Poland, the Baltic states and Finland to such an extent that Lonsdale-Bryans believed that Hassell feared the communists more much than the Nazis. Hassell gave Lonsdale- Bryans a letter in English that stated \\"assurances\\" that he sought. The terms that Hassell wanted for \\"a permanent pacification and re-establishment of Europe on a solid basis and a security against a renewal of war-like tendencies\\" called for the Reich to keep Austria and the Sudetenland and for the German-Polish border to be \\"more or less identical with the German frontier of 1914\\". Hassell was willing to accept the restoration of Polish and Czech independence but made it clear that he viewed Eastern Europe as Germany's exclusive sphere of influence although he was willing to accept Alsace-Lorraine as part of France. The rest of Hassell's letter contained a number of generalities about how after Hitler was overthrown, Europe should be guided by leaders who were committed to Christian values and would uphold human rights and social welfare. Lonsdale-Bryans's idea was \\"that the world ought to be divided into two parts. That Germany should be given a free hand in Europe and that the British Empire should run the rest of the world\\".Papers in the National Archives quoted in Later attempts Upon his return to Britain, the Foreign Office first learned that Lonsdale-Bryans expected generous financial compensation for his work. On 17 March 1940, Lonsdale- Bryan's patron, Lord Brocket, wrote to Alexander Cadogan, the Permanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office, to explain that Lonsdale-Bryans was deeply in debt and had a massive bank overdraft and so wanted lavish financial rewards for his work as an amateur diplomat. Cadogan wrote on the margin next to the part in Lord Brocket's letter about Lonsdale-Bryans's need for money \\"enlightening\\". The American historian Gerhard Weinberg called Lonsdale-Bryans a \\"rather dubious character\\", whose actions were motivated entirely by greed. Lonsdale-Bryans also met with Chamberlain and Halifax, both of whom were sympathetic to Hassell but not Lonsdale-Bryans. Halifax made it clear he wanted a professional diplomat to deal with Hassell and told Lonsdale-Bryans that he already sent \\"assurances\\" to Hassell via \\"another channel\\". Nonetheless, Lonsdale-Bryans returned to Arias to meet Hassell again on 14 April 1940 but offered little more than words of encouragement. The fact that fighting had begun five days earlier with the German invasion of Norway led the British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett to note \\"the discussion of a negotiated peace was purely academic\\" by now; despite Hassell's claims that the Wehrmacht generals were deeply opposed to Hitler, they were fighting fiercely against British, French and Polish troops in Norway. Lonsdale-Bryans then returned to Italy, where he continued his amateur diplomatic work until June 1940, when Italy entered the war. Then, he moved to Portugal, where he continued on much as he done in Italy. Lonsdale-Bryans \\"wrote to the then Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax with his plans.... MI5 was unsure as to how much backing Mr Lonsdale-Bryans had from Lord Halifax\\". A handwritten note by the MI5 stated: \\"He went to Italy with the knowledge of the Foreign Office in order to develop his contacts. He greatly exceeded his instructions\\". In October 1940, Lonsdale-Bryans continued his amateur diplomatic work by trying to set up a meeting with Hitler in Switzerland to discuss peace terms. Lonsdale-Bryans sent a letter from Portugal to the director of the Schwarzh√§upter publishing house in Leipzig, Germany, which had agreed to translate his book The Curve of Fate into German before the war. He wrote that he willing to meet Hitler in Switzerland to discuss Anglo-German peace terms and again demanded generous monetary rewards. In January 1941, the Foreign Office sent a message to the British embassy in Lisbon, Portugal, to find a way to ensure that \\"this undesirable and untrustworthy individual\\" would return to Britain at once before he did something that would cause Britain much embarrassment. Lonsdale-Bryans finally returned to Britain in 1941, much to the relief of the Foreign Office. British officials had a low opinion of Lonsdale-Bryans. On 11 February 1941, Cadogan called Lonsdale-Bryans in a memo \\"an idiot and something of a crook\\". A 1941 letter from an official in the Foreign Office stated, \\"Although there seems to been a good deal to been said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry, I understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the Foreign Office and the facilities afforded him to go to Italy\\". Another memo described Lonsdale-Bryans as \\"a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the Foreign Office\\". Until 1943, Lonsdale-Bryans continued to seek money from the Foreign Office despite its statements that it wanted nothing to do with him. Lonsdale-Bryans was on friendly terms with powerful members of the British aristocracy, including the Duke of Buccleuch and Lord Brocket, who also were Nazi sympathizers. When Winston Churchill succeeded Chamberlain as Prime Minister, Lord Halifax remained as Foreign Secretary until, in January 1941, he became the British ambassador to the United States.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of a subfamily of transcription factors that also includes TOX, TOX2, and TOX4 that share almost identical HMG-box DNA-binding domains which function to modify chromatin structure by unwinding and bending DNA. The protein TOX3 has a glutamine-rich C-terminus due to CAG repeats. TOX3 is located on human chromosome band 16q12.1. The gene consists of seven exons and is highly expressed in both the brain and luminal epithelial breast tissue. Mutations in the gene are associated with increased susceptibility to breast cancer. TOX3 plays a role in regulating calcium-dependent transcription and interacts with cAMP- response-element-binding protein (CREB) and CREB-binding protein (CBP). It also increases transcription via interaction with CITED1, a transcription co- regulator that increases transcription factor activity. Disease linkage Mutations in the TOX3 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The risk allele rs3803662 is a low-penetrance SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) associated with decreased expression of TOX3 and an increase in breast cancer risk. The risk locus was reported to regulate affinity of FOXA1 binding to chromatin, potentially affecting TOX3 expression. This locus also interacts with high-penetrance mutations BRCA1 and BRCA2 to increase risk. The rs3803662 variant has a high frequency in the population, with a minor allele frequency of 0.25. Little is known of the transcriptional mechanisms and protein interactions of TOX3. However, a 2019 publication identified TOX3 as a cancer suppressor gene in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and reported that downregulation of TOX3 facilitates the epithelial mesenchymal transition by decreasing repression of SNAI1 and SNAI2, resulting in tumor growth and metastasis. Like breast cancer, downregulation of TOX3 is associated with worse prognosis in ccRCC patients.

Nugiseks is also one of the four Estonian soldiers who received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Biography Nugiseks was born on Vana√µu farmstead, Karjak√ºla village, J√§rva County, S√§revere Province, Estonia. His parents were peasant farmers, and Harald attended the basic school at Laupa. He joined the Estonian Security battalion from the Commercial Institute at Pairu on 2 October 1941. When the German Army invaded Soviet territory it became Heinrich Himmler's policy that all Germanic regiments should be incorporated into Waffen SS units. Nugiseks became part of 185th battalion of General Georg von Kuchler's 18th Army officially known as Estniche Sicherungs Abteilung which was used as a security unit in the rearguard. But in 1943 the High Command decided reinforcements were needed for the Leningrad offensive. In 1943, he voluntarily joined the Estonian Legion. Three Estonian volunteer battalions were sent to Volkhov, when Nugiseks joined 660th commanded by Major Ellram. The 1st Estonian SS Volunteers was formed at Debica, Poland in August 1942 from police battalions such as Nugiseks. By March 1943 the unit was fighting with the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking on the Mius Front in the Ukraine. Two months later it was expanded into a No.3 Brigade consisting of two regiments, of three battalions each. They fought in hard battles against Communist Partisans and Soviet Regulars on the Nevel Front, and then at Velikye Luki. By November 1943, Nugiseks had already come under enemy fire, but the following month was transferred to the newly-formed 16th Army. In February 1944 his brigade joined Felix Steiner's III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps, renowned for hard fighting and tactical victories. In the teeth of repeated counter-attacks by the SS Estonian Division the Soviet infantry were relentless, breaking through the lines. After a month of brutal and incessant fighting at Siivertsi, thrown back into the river several times, the Soviets eventually reached Nugiseks position to the north of the village Narwa. The Dutch Nederland brigade's engineers were brought up to plug the gap in the line, but the Soviets called on massive reinforcements. The Estonians were short of men and facing insuperable odds. The Estonian volunteers under Nazi control were fighting along the right bank of the Narva River against superior Soviet forces. Despite being outnumbered the Estonian SS attacked with great ferocity driving back the Russians on the front. Nugiseks received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for leading the capture of the Vaasa-Siivertsi-Vepsk√ºla bridgehead. As the I Battalion, Waffen-Grenadier Regiment der SS 46 lost almost all of its officers, Nugiseks stepped in as the leader of the attack. He immediately changed tactics, loading a supply of hand grenade onto sledges so the stormtroopers would not have to crawl back for supplies over the minefields. Leo Tammiksaar (2001). L√ºhike √ºlevaade m√µningatest Eesti √ºksustest Wehrmachtis, politseis ja SS-is. (A Brief Overview on some Estonian Units in Wehrmacht, Police, and SS. In Estonian). Lennuliiklusteeninduse AS, Tallinn With hand grenades being passed on along the line of trenches, a bridgehead was at last squeezed in from the north by \\"rolling\\" tactics, his platoon engaged in desperate hand-to-hand fighting using spades, hand grenades and bayonets. Nugiseks was mentioned in the Wehrmachtbericht and in the Nazi Signal magazine following his Knight's Cross award, which was personally given to him by the SA occupation head in Estonia, Karl-Siegmund Litzmann on 9 April 1944, while Nugiseks was recuperating in T√ºri hospital. Only the second Estonian to receive the honour, the whole ceremony was filmed for propaganda purposes. In the action the divisional commander Standartenfuhrer Franz Ausberger, an Austrian, was wounded and also received the Knights Cross. Unterscharfuhrer Nugiseks was only 22 years old leading a Zugfuhrer (platoon leader) of Estonians defending the homeland against invasion for his unit I.46. and the first non-officer to be so awarded. Afterwards Nugiseks was demoted for fighting with some soldiers who were harassing Red Cross nurses. During the Soviet assault on Estonia in September 1944, Nugiseks' home was destroyed. Nugiseks was captured by Czech partisans in May 1945 and put in a prisoner-of-war camp. After three unsuccessful escape attempts, he served time after being handed over to the Soviets, who had sentenced him to ten years in the Gulag and five years deportation in Siberia. Nugiseks managed to return to Estonia in 1958: on release from Tyumenskaya oblast he worked as a labourer in Parnu area of Estonia until his retirement. In the 1970s, he constructed a house for the family using his own hands. Finally on 21 February 1994, service to his country was recognised when Major-General Aleksander Einseln made Nugiseks a Retired Captain (erukapten) of the Estonian Defence Forces. Nugiseks attended reburial of Alfons Rebane, another Estonian Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross holder, ordered by the Estonian government. After 4229 signatures were collected in October 2008, Captain Nugiseks was awarded the Medal of Gratitude by the people of Estonia for his part in the fight against Bolshevism. Revered and honoured by his community, a bust was posthumously installed at his school.

It is also simply known as \\"exposure.\\" http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketexposure.asp Exposure is the product of a marketing strategy, and once the strategy is implemented it is only a matter of time before exposure is put into action. Consumers recognize \\"marketing exposure\\" when the company creates and promotes a campaign. There are three types of marketing exposure: intensive, selective, and exclusive.\\"Marketing Strategy.\\" The IEBM Encyclopedia of Marketing. Ed. Michael J. Baker. London: International Thomson Business Press, 1999. 161-87. Print. Marketing exposure carries a risk total to the amount invested in said market; if a particular business invests 25% in a sector for housing then the market exposure for this sector is 25%. Investors are warned not to invest vast amounts in one particular sector due to the exposure results may vary between gains and losses depending on outcome of specific market strategies, being diverse in sectors are advised for lowering the risk factor. Overview Marketing exposure is put into action after a marketing strategy has been implemented. In the marketing world, exposure is a number within a portfolio. In the consumer world, exposure is a company's campaign or brand that is trying to market specific products to help service the consumer. It is also a way to make a business stand out in the marketplace. Without marketing exposure, campaigns would be non-existent and therefore companies would suffer. Purpose Marketing exposure is a major part that determines a company's success in their market. Although it is never directly identified or defined, it crucial for helping a company progress, creating competition for other companies, making the company more credible with consumers, and overall benefit both the company while satisfying consumers. While all of this may seem easy, it typically takes months of preparation to create, launch, and manage a campaign. Campaigns must be exposed thoroughly in the market as much as possible without annoying or bothering consumers to the point of \\"overexposing\\" the campaign. There is a fine balance between keeping the consumers interested in a product or brand, and annoying them to the point that they have no interest in supporting a company.Kerin, Roger A., Steven W. Hartley, and William Rudelius. \\"Managing Marketing Channels and Wholesaling.\\" Marketing. New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2009. 390-413. Print. To expose a campaign successfully, many factors must be considered. Exposure is not only limited to a consumer base, exposure can also be to other companies in the market. These companies do not have to be similar to the business which aims for positive exposure, on the contrary the companies should be diverse which can reach into other markets opening up new pathways. Also as advised before diversifying into many sectors also reduces the risk of profit loss where as being too diverse means resources are stretched out very thin causing minimum returns. There must be a balances between taking risks and diversifying. Objectives Exposure objectives are the basic goals that the company is looking to accomplish in their campaign. Among the important goals, first understanding their consumer is key. For successful exposure, the company must create a target market‚Äîidentify the specific consumer and their needs. Consumer factors and environmental factors can determine whether or not the company is capable of selling their product or service. Therefore, the company must evaluate what they have to offer and then determine how their product can help the consumer. Once the consumer and their needs have been identified, companies can figure out their goals and strategies as to how they can get the consumer to choose their product or service over the competitor's. Factors Within the objectives, factors must be taken into consideration. Factors fall into Environmental, Consumer, Product, and Company categories. Understanding these factors and how they effect the marketplace can greatly determine whether or not the objectives (or goals) can be attained. =Environmental= Environmental factors include change in every day consumer life. Examples include changes in family lifestyles, advances in technology, and the way consumers use the Internet. Companies cannot directly control changes in the environment, however they can create objectives or ways to market the product. If the company can expose the product in the right way, companies can convince the consumer that the product improves their environment and creates a service they believe they need. =Consumer= Consumer factors are key to selling a product. A company is capable of taking their product and selling it to potential buyers only if company understands their buyers. That is why companies must ask important questions such as: Who are potential customers? Where do they buy? When do they buy? How do they buy? What do they buy? Having a deeper understanding of these questions helps companies analyze their consumer and determine how to best approach them. =Product= The company's product is something that the company already has a deep understanding of. What makes the product such an important factor is determining its purpose and value in the marketplace. The purpose of the product depends on the tasks it completes, how small or large it is, and its complexity just to name a few. Next, the value in the particular marketplace is important. For example, a product such as a scientific computer is expensive, which eliminates many consumers because not many want to pay for a scientific computer. On the other hand, pepper, an inexpensive commodity, attracts many more consumers since they use it in everyday life‚Äîso the consumer demographic is much larger. =Company= Company factors are of highest importance. The company must understand their place in the marketplace and recognize their financial, human, and technological capabilities. The financial, human, and technological capabilities of a company determine how efficiently the company can execute their campaign. Once these factors are understood and recognized, the company can then create a successful campaign. Companies must also connect with other companies for the most effect in exposure. This is due to the reason that branching out to make connections will create bonds and pathways for companies to extend into other markets which they can receive more exposure. If done correctly the exposure gained will result on sales of goods and services increasing which would mean the exposure to these new markets would cause the investments into such sectors open and increase the return on investments Strategizing Once objectives are set, the company can begin strategizing how they can successfully approach and execute their campaign. The basic principles of marketing strategy are simply stated: to achieve persistent success in the marketplace over competition. With these basic principles, the company must recognize their competition, and strategize how they can be unique, while yielding positive results in the marketplace. To yield the best results in the market place requires two essential elements: the issue of the position, specifically within the 'strategic triangle' (the customers, competitors, and corporation), and of time (the analysis of the past and future). Using these principles and essential elements, companies must develop their campaign strategies. The company must develop these strategies and then determine their rate of exposure, who they are exposing it to, and how they plan on presenting the information.Managerial Marketing. \\"Marketing Management: Place.\\" Managerial Marketing. Ed. Managerial Marketing. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Mar. 2013. These strategies embody a range of marketing techniques from the campaign slogan to where advertising is placed. The Portfolio The general goal of the portfolio is to compile data to show to customers or employers how successful or unsuccessful the campaign and exposure was. Since the global financial crisis, it has been crucial for companies to use portfolios. The marketing exposure portfolio holds all of the monetary information that assesses how the exposure is interacting with consumers in the marketplace, the amount of money being spent on the campaign, as well as the amount of returns the company is getting for the campaign from the consumers. This portfolio helps to determine the gross potential, and when the company can break even. After the campaign has ended, it also allows the company to assess how well their campaign worked and whether or not consumers embraced the company's product. After reviewing these numbers companies can then assess the effectiveness of the campaign and if in the future events the campaign needs to be changed. by keeping connected to the target market companies can read the thought patterns and plan for future implementations of the type of exposure which would result a high profit with the least amount of cost and use of resource.

She only had 48 hours to prepare before taking part in the 59th Miss World pageant held in South Africa. As Miss England, Hodge managed to persuade the organisers to remove the bikini round from the Miss England competition. This, she said, would change people's views of beauty pageants, from being just about looks and more about the girl. Hodge said \\"To be Miss England you don't have to be the girl who looks best in a swimsuit, thankfully it's much more than that, it's about being a good role model\\". The bikini round of the 2010 competition was removed and replaced with a sportswear round.

Its introduction in 1987 (as part of Arthur, the predecessor to ) was a new concept in GUIs. It displays icons through which access is provided to all parts of the computer that a typical user will require, from physical devices and system utilities to running applications, and will usually be their starting point for interacting with the system once it has finished booting.  Appearance and features  The bar is fixed in height and located at the bottom of the screen. It takes up the full width of the screen, and a single row of icons is displayed within. Icons are either justified to the left or the right edge of the screen, at the control of the owning program. According to Acorn's official RISC OS Style Guide, a program should place its icons to the left hand side of the icon bar if they relate to physical devices or resources such as filing systems. These will have an item of text underneath them identifying the device or resource. All other icons should be placed on the right of the bar.RISC OS 3 Style Guide, p.94. Acorn Computers Limited, 1993, RISC OS Style Guide, p.104. RISC OS Open Limited, 2015, If too many icons are present to be displayed at once then the icon bar will extend horizontally and become wider than the screen; in order to access the non-visible icons the user must scroll the bar by hovering the mouse pointer at the appropriate edge of the screen. The result of clicking the left mouse button (known as the Select button) on an icon will vary depending on what the icon represents. For filing systems, a filer window will open containing the contents of the root directory. For document-oriented applications supporting multiple open documents, clicking Select will open a window containing a new, empty document. This is different from the behaviour of the typical Taskbar and Dock, where clicking an icon will result in a task switch (All windows associated with the icon will be brought to the front of the window stack and will gain input focus). For programs that do not support multiple open documents, clicking its icon will typically result in the task switch behaviour. By pressing the middle (Menu) mouse button while the pointer is over an icon, a context-sensitive menu associated with that icon will open. Although the owner of the icon is responsible for the contents of the menu, the menus for icons with similar functions will typically contain the same subset of options. For example, filing systems will allow the naming and formatting of disks, as well as an option to open a window displaying free space. Most applications will provide access to an Info window (displaying the version number and copyright information), online help, and a quit option. Drag and Drop, Filer Icons (File or Directory) can be dragged and dropped on top of an icon bar icon to initiate a process, if the object type is known to the application. For example: * Copying a file or directory to the root of a floppy or network drive * Adding a file or directory to a compressed archive * Opening a text file in a word-processor * Playing a music file or video * Deleting a file by placing it in the waste bin Even if there are no running applications or active filing systems, the icon bar will contain a small number of system- managed icons: * The Apps icon, located within the left-hand group of icons. This was introduced in RISC OS 3 as a way to access the applications built into the computer's ROM. It is actually just a frontend to the read-only ResourceFS filing system; when the icon is clicked it opens the Resources:$.Apps folder. Although ResourceFS is read-only via the usual filing system interface, system APIs can be used to add or replace files. In RISC OS 3.5 this functionality was leveraged to allow the user to easily add his own applications to the Apps folder, via the AddApp\\"RISC OS Star Commands@Everything2.com\\" star command. The applications inserted using AddApp are simple shell applications that will just execute the real, original copy of the application when they are started. This allows the applications to be added without using significant amounts of RAM and restricting them to read- only access to their internal files. * The Task Manager icon, located to the far right of the icon bar. When clicked with the left mouse button this opens a window similar to that of the Windows Task Manager, where the running programs and processes are listed, along with their memory usage. Basic control over the processes is also available (forced termination and in some cases manual control over how much memory is allocated). From the task manager's icon bar menu it is also possible to shut down the computer, exit the window manager to the single-tasking CLI, or open a multi-tasking CLI window. A desktop boot file can also be saved, which contains the current state of the desktop and any loaded programs. In theory this provides full hibernation support, although in reality because each program is responsible for saving and restoring its state within the file, the computer's state after executing the saved boot file will not be identical to its state before. * The Display Manager icon is located just to the left of the task manager. This allows selection of which display mode is in use. In versions of RISC OS prior to 3.5, where memory restrictions forced most people to use modes with 16 or less colours, it was also possible to alter the current palette from this icon. In RISC OS 3 the AddTinyDir star command was introduced, which allows an icon for any file, folder or application to be added to the left-hand side of the icon bar. This provides functionality similar to that later embodied in the Mac OS X dock.\\"AppleInsider: Road to Mac OS X Leopard: Dock 1.6\\"  History and evolution   Arthur  The icon bar first appeared in the Arthur operating system, in 1987. To the right was an Exit icon, which provided an exit to the command line (later to be replaced by the Task Manager). In keeping with the operating system as a whole, the icon bar reflected the multicolour appearance, being orange in colour  RISC OS 2  RISC OS 2 in 1988 introduced the Task Manager and Display icons, with the Task Manager adopting Acorn's Archimedes logo. The colour scheme was also revised and a suite of applications supplied on floppy disk. Amongst these was one called TinyDirs, which allowed users to dock applications and directories on the icon bar for convenient access.A3000 User Guide, p.181. Acorn Computers Limited,  RISC OS 3  RISC OS 3 in 1991 introduced the Apps icon to the left and replaced the Task Managers Archimedes logo with the Acorn nut. Apps provided access to the ROM based applications and the functionality of TinyDirs was replaced by the OS command AddTinyDir. The Shift-F12 keyboard shortcut and icon grouping were also added, with the intention of simplifying the finding of desired icons. The whole of RISC OS, including the icon bar, was given a facelift in 1993 including replacement of the flat grey colour with a textured wallpaper. This was referred to as the 3D \\"Look and Feel\\". In 1994, this 3D look was provided as standard with the release of RISC OS 3.5 on the series. The \\"nested Wimp\\" introduced in 1998 (as a soft load for existing machines) added the feature to temporarily bring the icon bar to the front of the window stack by moving the pointer to the bottom of the screen (previously this required Shift-F12 on the keyboard).  RISC OS 4  RISC OS 4 in 1999 introduced the facility for iconised windows to be sent to the icon bar rather than the Pinboard. The facelift introduced in RISC OS 3.5 was also incorporated directly into the OS, as well as the method of popping the icon bar to the front. The Task Manager icon was again replaced, this time with the cube logo used by . Later versions of replaced the Task Managers cube with the cogwheel, designed by Richard Hallas.  RISC OS 5  RISC OS 5 in 2002 introduced further changes in icon design, including the Iyonix 'blue jellybean' Task Manager icon, again designed by Richard Hallas.  RISC OS 6  RISC OS 6 in 2006 introduced the number 6 in the centre of the Task Managers cogwheel icon. Where appropriate, Adjust (right mouse button) clicks perform consistent operations such as loading the configuration choices for parts of the system.

These troops were available for service alongside the Indian Army when such service was requested by the British government. At the beginning of the 20th century, their total numbers were about 18,000 men. The troops were routinely inspected by British army officers and generally had the same equipment as soldiers in the British Indian Army. Although their numbers were relatively small, the Imperial Service Troops were employed in China and British Somaliland in the first decade of the 20th century, and later saw action in the First World War and Second World War. Genesis Mysore Imperial Service Troops circa 1910 In March 1885, after a Russian force defeated the Afghan army at Panjdeh, a village on the ill-defined Russian-Afghan frontier, the British were alarmed and immediately dispatched units from the Army of India to reinforce the North-West Frontier defenses. The \\"Panjdeh incident,\\" however, also resulted in generous donations of money for a potential war effort from many Indian rulers, most notably the Nizam of Hyderabad. Although the incident was later resolved by a compromise, the timely support of the Indian princes prompted the British to create a reserve force of approximately 20,000 soldiers recruited from the armies of the Native States, but trained and equipped by the Indian Army. The cost of the training and new equipment was borne by the Native States. Armies of the Princely States The armies of the Princely States were bound by many restrictions that were imposed by subsidiary alliances. They existed mainly for ceremonial use and for internal policing. According to the , > \\"Since a chief can neither attack his neighbour nor fall out with a foreign > nation, it follows that he needs no military establishment which is not > required either for police purposes or personal display, or for cooperation > with the Imperial Government.

In return the princely states were required to bring the pledged troops up to a level of preparation that would enable them to serve alongside regular Indian regiments. To this end Indian Army officers were seconded to Imperial Service Troops units and schools of instruction were established for IST recruits.John Gaylor, page 50 \\"Sons of John Company\\" A senior British officer was appointed as Inspector-General of Imperial Service Troops with a staff of inspectors to undertake IST training and advise the military durbars of each of the states.Lt. Gen.

Gen. Sir George MacMunn, page 198 \\"The Armies of India\\", Early campaigns Kashmir was the first of the participating states to provide a contingent for active service. This took the form of two mountain batteries who fought in the Hunza Nagar campaign of 1891 and the subsequent Chitral action of 1895. Nine Indian states provided Imperial Service detachments for the Frontier War of 1897. Alwar, Bikanir, Jodhpur and Malerkotla provided units for service in China during the Boxer Rebellion of 1901. The Bikanir Camel Corps subsequently served in Somaliland in 1902. While it was not British policy to employ Indian troops in the South African War of 1899‚Äì1902, considerable numbers of horses and quantities of equipment from Imperial Service stocks were provided by the princely states. The various Imperial Service units often had elaborate parade uniforms,Lt. Gen. Sir George MacMunn, colour plates between pages 178 and 179 \\"The Armies of India\\", designed and changed at the whim of individual state rulers.

Smaller numbers served as artillery, sappers and signals personnel, while Camel Corps troopers, mainly recruited in Bikanir, numbered 637. During the First World War 18,000 Imperial Service soldiers saw service in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Palestine and East Africa, including the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces. Sappers and transport units were sent to France. Contingents from the smaller states did not serve overseas but were employed, on internal security duties or training cavalry remounts, in India itself.John Gaylor, pages 50-53 \\"Sons of John Company - the Indian and Pakistan Armies 1903-1991\\", In the emotional atmosphere prevailing at the beginning of the war many of the Indian rulers went beyond meeting the standing commitment to make Imperial Service Troops available for whatever purpose the Government of India decided. In September 1914 the Viceroy Lord Hardinge reported that 700 Indian princes had offered their services in various forms from the sending of troops to the provision of hospital ships or financial assistance. =Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade= From 1914 to 1916, as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force commanded by General Maxwell, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade with the 10th and 11th Indian Divisions, the Bikanir Camel Corps and three batteries of Indian Mountain Artillery, took part in the Defence of the Suez Canal Campaign at the beginning of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign.Bruce 2002, pp. 15‚Äì6Carver 2003, pp. 8‚Äì9Wavell 1968, p. 27 The Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, made up of the Jodhpore Imperial Service Lancers, the Mysore Imperial Service Lancers and the 1st Hyderabad Imperial Service Lancers, continued to serve in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during 1917. In 1918 these regiments formed the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Cyril Rodney Harbord, in the 5th Cavalry Division commanded by Major General H. J.

On paper the Indian States Forces comprised approximately 50,000 men drawn from forty-nine states. Economic and other considerations slowed progress in introducing the new scheme, which was not fully implemented until 1939. Second World War During the Second World War the Indian States or Princely states provided 250,000 men for service with the Indian States Forces (ISF).Brown, p.134 ISF units saw service in Malaya, Burma, North Africa, the Middle East and Italy while detachments served as garrison and internal security troops in India itself. Five ISF battalions were part of the garrison of Singapore when it fell to the Japanese in February 1942. Post Independence Following 1947, sixty-nine former Indian States Forces units were transferred into the part of the Indian Army which transferred to the new Dominion of India. ISF infantry units were generally added to existing regular regiments: the 1st and 2nd Patiala Infantry for example becoming the 15th and 16th (Patiala) battalions of the Punjab Regiment. Six ISF cavalry regiments were however amalgamated to form the newly raised 61st Cavalry, which remains the only horse mounted non-ceremonial unit in the Indian Army.

Psychomotor learning is demonstrated by physical skills such as movement, coordination, manipulation, dexterity, grace, strength, speed‚Äîactions which demonstrate the fine or gross motor skills, such as use of precision instruments or tools, and walking. Behavioral examples include driving a car, throwing a ball, and playing a musical instrument. In psychomotor learning research, attention is given to the learning of coordinated activity involving the arms, hands, fingers, and feet, while verbal processes are not emphasized. Stages of psychomotor development According to Paul Fitts and Michael Posner's three-stage model, when learning psychomotor skills, individuals progress through the cognitive stages, the associative stage, and the autonomic stage. The cognitive stage is marked by awkward slow and choppy movements that the learner tries to control. The learner has to think about each movement before attempting it. In the associative stage, the learner spends less time thinking about every detail, however, the movements are still not a permanent part of the brain. In the autonomic stage, the learner can refine the skill through practice, but no longer needs to think about the movement. Factors affecting psychomotor skills *Psychological feedback *Amount of practice *Task complexity *Work distribution *Motive-incentive conditions *Environmental factors How motor behaviors are recorded The motor cortices are involved in the formation and retention of memories and skills. When an individual learns physical movements, this leads to changes in the motor cortex. The more practiced a movement is, the stronger the neural encoding becomes. A study cited how the cortical areas include neurons that process movements and that these neurons change their behavior during and after being exposed to tasks.

His nickname was (\\"the Cardboard picker\\"). D'Amico defected from the NCO and subsequently became a pentito in 1983.Jacquemet, Credibility in Court, pp. 74-76 Among the pentiti, D'Amico was one of the highest-ranking due to his position within the NCO. He was the first high-ranking NCO informant to reveal Neapolitan crime boss, Raffaele Cutolo links with the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta.Behan, See Naples and Die, pp. 316 Biography  Position within the NCO  D'Amico was one of the earliest members of the NCO, ever since its inception in Cutolo's hometown of Ottaviano on October 24, 1970. He was a santista, i.e., a member of the NCO executive board. He had the power to incorporate new members into the organization, and the autonomy to make important decisions, from the commission of killings to the exploration of new economical ventures. After he was arrested in the early 1980s, he was transferred to Naples' Poggioreale prison where he became the roommate of Raffaele Cutolo. This factor made him the messenger for Cutolo's orders, and was instrumental in propelling him to the top management of the NCO hierarchy. For instance, when on April 13, 1981, Raffaella Esposito, a ten-year-old girl from Somma Vesuviana, a small village in the proximity of Ottaviano was kidnapped, D'Amico warned the kidnappers during an appearance in the courtroom: \\"Leave her free, or the NCO will kill you.\\" The media reported this warning after the Italian police, who had arrested Giovanni Castiello, a 37-year-old factory worker on kidnapping charges, had to release him for lack of evidence. A few months later, the body of Raffaella Esposito was found in a ravine of her village. When word of this spread around, the NCO took upon itself the task to avenge the little girl's murder. Castiello was ambushed and shot dead in the streets of his village. In a telephone call to the Italian press agency ANSA, the NCO proclaimed that Castiello had been found guilty of the kidnapping and had been giustiziato (executed). The tone was eerily similar to that of political terrorist groups in Italy. Escape from prison and recapture In the summer of 1981, D'Amico escaped from prison and joined the executive board of the NCO branch outside prison, which was called Cielo Coperto (cloudy sky). He worked closely with Vincenzo Casillo, then second-in- command to Cutolo, and he accumulated a wealth of information on the different operations which were managed by the NCO. D'Amico was again arrested at the end of 1981. This time, during a raid on his apartment, police found very sensitive materials on him including a copy of the ritual of initiation, an agenda full of names, letters, money orders receipts, etc., which confirmed the Justice Department's suspicion of his role as a leader. Due to Cutolo's ability to command respect from the penitentiary direction, which until 1982 usually promptly consented to all his requests, D'Amico was sent to the prison on Ascoli Piceno where he joined the leadership of the NCO. Becoming a Pentito According to his later confession to the Justice Department, D'Amico began having his first doubts about the NCO after the murder of Antonio Di Matteo, an NCO member who was planning on switching sides to the rival Camorra clan, Nuova Famiglia. Di Matteo was murdered together with his mother, sister and sister-in-law. After this episode, D'Amico wrote a letter to the Neapolitan daily Il Mattino where he expressed his repugnance for the murders of so many innocent victims. However, this letter was read by a warden on the NCO's payroll who advised D'Amico to destroy it, in order to avoid trouble with the leadership at Ascoli Piceno. D'Amico then backed down claiming to have written the letter in a moment of rage. Also, when Cutolo's influence deteriorated in 1982 and he was relocated to a prison on the island Asinara at the insistence of then Italian president Sandro Pertini, D'Amico began having serious doubts as to the NCO's ability to compete successfully against the NF and the Italian Justice Department. Finally, in the summer of 1983, one of his godsons, Nicola Mazzo, aka \\"'o Carusiello\\" (The Cabman) showed him a letter by Cutolo in which Cutolo claimed that he was willing to sacrifice seven of his best men, among them D'Amico, in exchange for a peace treaty with the NF. Astounded by this high level of treachery that was being perpetrated by Cutolo, D'Amico decided to collaborate with Italian Justice on September 27, 1983. D'Amico's cooperation which came one year later than that of Pasquale Barra, was viewed by the Justice department as extremely valuable because it enabled the Department to cover the latest period of the NCO's activities, especially its response to the 1983 crackdown by the Italian government. D'Amico would testify against Cutolo and numerous NCO members during the three-year-long Maxi Trials. His testimony along with those of Giovanni Pandico, Pasquale Barra, Mario Incarnato, etc. were found reliable and convincing enough to become a significant factor in the convictions of more than 800 defendants. However, many of the pentiti's allegations were proved to be fabrications and several of the convicted defendants were released. References *Jacquemet, Marco (1996).

Early life and education Humphreys was born in Exeter, Devon on 13 February 1973, the youngest of four siblings. Growing up in Exmouth, Humphreys loved sport and played competitive rugby for Exmouth Rugby Club and for the County of Devon whilst at school, but it was the draw of the sea that held his true ambition. As part of the Exmouth Sailing Club, he competed in 2 Cadet world championships, winning the Junior Worlds in Holland 1989 and finishing 6th at the 1990 Cadet Worlds in Poland. It was at this point, he was asked to join a youth team preparing for the Fastnet in 1991, winning the Fastnet overall thrust him into the world of ocean racing. (Humphreys was to win the Fastnet race overall for the second time in 1997 with Ross Field on board the Ericsson 80 \\"Banque Internationale Luxembourg\\") Humphreys attended Exeter College, initially training to become a journalist, but the Whitbread Round the World Race in 1993‚Äì94Volvo Ocean Race pulled him away from his studies to race around the world at the age of 19 years. He was to return to the University of Plymouth where he graduated in 1997 with a BSc in Ocean Science and Meteorology. Humphreys was also later awarded an Honorary Master of Science from Plymouth University in 2005. Professional career Combining both his passions (sport and the outdoors) Humphreys founded Sport Environment, a sports marketing consultancy in 2001 and has worked with a number of leading brands, organisations and charities in both sailing and outdoor events. His creative drive and passion has led him to doing some pioneering work using sport as a catalyst for change. As a former Board Member of Sport England, he is particularly interested in using sport as a creative tool for engaging people with the issues that society faces. Humphreys is also a motivational speaker and coach and has worked with a number of organisation with organisational change. He's a passionate speaker and give talks about culture, leadership, agility and teamwork. Sailing career After racing in the 1993‚Äì94 Whitbread, Humphreys skippered the student yachting team whilst at Plymouth University to success winning the BUSA Student Yachting Nationals and finishing 2nd at World Championships. At the end of his studies, he applied for a place to Skipper one of the BT Global ChallengeGlobal Challenge 72's in the 2000‚Äì2001 edition of the race. Humphreys and his LG FLATRON team went on to dominate the race setting a record pace and winning four out of seven legs. At just 26 years of age, Humphreys became the youngest winning skipper in the history of the race. In 2001, Humphreys teamed up with Mike Golding as navigator for the EDS Atlantic Challenge, competing two transatlantic crossings and finishing 3rd in the inaugural edition of the race. He later joined Will Oxley for the 2001 edition of the Rolex Sydney Hobart Race and went onto race in the Sydney Hobart as navigator for Commodore, CYCA, Matt Allan's Ichiban 70 in the next five editions of the race, coming close to winning the race overall in 2003. In 2003, Humphreys secured sponsorship with Motorola for the Transat Jacques Vabre and raced double-handed with Australian speedster Paul Larsen. The duo won the 50 ft class by over 500 miles. The result gave him the opportunity to pitch a campaign to Motorola for the 2004‚Äì05 Vendee Globe. On 20 February 2005, Humphreys became only the 5th British sailor to complete the Vend√©e Globe. He finished 7th after 104 days at sea in what has been acknowledged as one of the most remarkable comebacks in the history of the Vend√©e Globe race. Humphreys would later sell his Open 60, Hellomoto to yachtswoman Dee Caffari and moved into the Extreme 40 Class again with Motorola competing in the inaugural edition of the Volvo Extreme Sailing Series during the Volvo Ocean Race. Humphreys selected Leigh McMillan as Helmsman for the campaign, which would see them finish 3rd overall, winning the final event in Rotterdam. Multihull sailing was taking off and as the Extreme Sailing Series grew, Humphreys teamed with DMS as main partner for the Archipelago Raid 2007. The tough Scandinavian event is an incredible endurance race in small 18 ft Formula 18 catamarans. Humphreys and teammate Ryan, would sail 4 editions of the Archipelago Raid, finishing 4th in the 2008 edition of the race. In 2011, Humphreys again teamed up with sponsor, DMS for the La Solitaire du Figaro, the unofficial World Championships for single-handed sailing. Humphreys sailed under the banner of the Artemis Academy which was set up by OC Sport to support talented solo sailors. After a break from solo sailing, Humphreys returned to race in the 2014 edition of the Route du Rhum with the Class 40, sponsored by Cat Phones and Bullitt Group. After a difficult start to the race, he suffered a dismasting 400 miles west of Lisbon and had to retire from the race. Mutiny ‚Äì recreating Captain Bligh's epic voyage of survival In 2016, Humphreys was recruited to be the professional skipper on board the ambitious recreation of Captain Bligh's 4000 mile voyage in an open 23 foot boat from Tonga to Timor for Channel 4. Using traditional navigation equipment and surviving off the same meagre rations as Bligh, a team of nine men led by SBS soldier, Anthony Middleton were cast adrift to recreate one of the world's greatest open boat voyages of British history. Charity work In 2007, Humphreys founded the Blue Project, a social enterprise to encourage people to connect and protect our blue environment. Between 2007-2017, the Blue Project (now Blue Foundation) celebrated a number of achievements, including creating the award-winning Blue Mile, a series of watersports and educational events that immersed participants across the UK and promoted environmental conservation. The Blue Project supported leading charities, WWF, Marine Conservation Society and the Shark Trust raising funds to support their much needed work. Humphreys is a trustee of the Island Sailing Trust, a local sailing charity that supports young, disabled and disadvantaged children by taking them sailing on three classic yachts, Pegasus, Moosk and Tectona. Personal life Humphreys married Vikki Cheung in 2002 and they have two children, Katelyn and Isabel. They live in Brixham, South Hams, Devon.

He practised law in South Africa and the United Kingdom from the 1940s until his retirement in 2013, and played a leading role in a number of the most significant political trials in apartheid-era South Africa, including the Treason Trial of Nelson Mandela and the 1978 inquest into the death of Steve Biko. Kentridge's wife, Felicia Kentridge, was also a leading anti-apartheid lawyer. Early life and education Kentridge was born in 1922 in Johannesburg, the son of Lithuanian- born Jewish lawyer and politician Morris Kentridge (1881‚Äì1964). Sydney Kentridge attended Johannesburg's King Edward VII School, before studying at the University of Witwatersrand. He graduated in 1942, and served during the Second World War as an intelligence officer in the South African Army in East Africa and Italy. After the war, he attended Exeter College, Oxford, on an ex- serviceman's grant, and graduated with a first-class BA in Jurisprudence in 1948. Legal career In 1949, after working briefly as a judge's clerk, Kentridge was admitted as an advocate of the Supreme Court of South Africa. He was appointed a Senior Counsel in 1965. He became a leading defence lawyer in political trials in South Africa, with some of his major cases including the Treason Trial (1958‚Äì61), which saw him defend Nelson Mandela, and the Prisons Trial (1968‚Äì69).

He died a miserable and lonely death on a cold prison floor.\\" Lord Alexander of Weedon wrote of his performance: \\"Through remorseless and deadly cross-examination, sometimes with brilliant irony, Kentridge established that the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement had been killed by police brutality. The verdict of accidental death was seen as risible.\\" In a 1984 British television dramatisation of the Biko inquest, Kentridge was portrayed by Albert Finney. Kentridge practised at the English Bar between 1977 and 2013, and was appointed Queen‚Äôs Counsel in 1984. He became a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1985.

Frickley & South Elmsall Colliery  The first sod was cut on 23 April 1903 of shafts No.1 and No.2 and the Barnsley Bed was hit on 23 May 1905 at a depth of 606 m. Sumps were established at a depth of 624 m in the Dunsil seam. Both shafts were 7 m in diameter and brick lined throughout. South Elmsall Colliery, situated in the same curtilage as Frickley, was sunk during 1920‚Äì23 reaching the Shafton seam at a depth of 218 m. This No.3 shaft was 4.26 m in diameter and brick lined throughout. Despite being located in South Elmsall, the colliery was sunk within the land of Frickley Hall, part of the small Hamlet of Frickley, hence the Frickley name. The Carlton Main Colliery Company was a model employer with strong views on the welfare of its workers. It built the Warde-Aldam Hospital in 1911\\"The National Archives: Hospital Records\\" The National Archives. U.K. Web. 28 April 2017. and it's welfare schemes also included a maternity home, medical service, recreation ground, swimming baths and other sports facilities including the formation of Frickley Colliery F.C. later Frickley Athletic F.C. and Frickley Cricket Club, as part of the Frickley Athletic Club. The Barnsley seam was worked until 1934 by hand-got tub stalls when mechanical conveying was introduced at the coal face. During the next three years the installation of face conveyors was completed almost throughout the whole pit. The total output was obtained from the Barnsley seam until 1942 when the Dunsil seam was entered in a small area to the south of the shaft piller. Since 1942 further access to the Dunsil has been obtained by means of drifts from the Barnsley level and two further areas to the West and East have been entered to work the Dunsil seam. Coal winding remains at the original Barnsley level. In 1951 the first prop free, front face with an armoured conveyor installation started up on 101's unit in the East Dunsil area. In February 1955 it became necessary to start off a face in the East Dunsil on the end cleat of coal and it was considered that such conditions would lend themselves to the use of an Anderton Disc Shearer machine working in conjunction with an armoured conveyor, friction type props and link bar supports. Central Power Station The Frickley & South Elmsall Collieries were powered by electricity and the company built in 1925 the \\"Central Power Station\\" at Frickley.

Despite having plentiful and easily accessible reserves, the pit closed on 26 November 1993, leaving massive social and economic problems in the local area. In its heyday in the 1930s the colliery employed 4000 men and boys and at is closure on 26 November 1993 735 men. To this day Frickley lives on in many peoples hearts and minds, Frickley Athletic F.C. continue to represent the name nationally at a high level of football, with the Westfield Lane stadium backing onto the former colliery. Regeneration Remediation work at Frickley colliery In 2005 it was announced the majority of the former colliery will be reclaimed to provide a high quality country park. As part of the scheme, provision will be made to allow the creation of new sport pitches and allotments if required. On the site of the former pithead up to 160 homes will be built, which will include affordable housing and overall will achieve some of the highest standards for sustainability in the country.

The building has previously been a hotel, guest house, event venue, and military camp. Currently, the H≈çheikan is registered as one of the National Important Cultural Properties, and is used as a wedding venue, restaurant and meeting facility. The building is run by the Sapporo city.  History  Administered by the Hokkaid≈ç Development Commission (Kaitaku shi), the construction of the H≈çheikan was started in 1879 in the Nishi 1-ch≈çme area of Odori Park. It was completed in November 1880, and opened in December of the same year. The purpose of the construction was to construct an accommodation for the other countries' engineers developing the primitive Hokkaid≈ç prefecture. The building was officially opened as a hotel in August 1881, and invited the Emperor Meiji as the first guest. He stayed in the H≈çheikan for four days. Winning fame as a hotel at which the Emperor had stayed, the H≈çheikan was used for many ceremonies and as a hotel for officials. In 1882, the Hokkaid≈ç Development Commission was demolished, and after the ownership of the H≈çheikan was moved, the Imperial Household Ministry has lent the building to Sapporo. Followed by the Emperor Meiji, the Emperor Taish≈ç stayed in the H≈çheikan in 1911, so as the Emperor Sh≈çwa in 1922. As the city of Sapporo grew, the demand for the event venues increased. Sapporo city begged the Imperial Household Ministry for moving the ownership of the building to Sapporo, and in 1921, the H≈çheikan was yielded to Sapporo city. In 1927, the building was enlarged by constructing new rooms on its back side, and the H≈çheikan was used as the musical venue. Along with the beginning of World War II, the H≈çheikan functioned as the facility for the Japanese Northern District Army, and after Japan lost the war, it was confiscated by the American army and used as their accommodation. After the American army moved to the Camp Crowford, which was a camp constructed in current Minami-ku, Sapporo, the H≈çheikan was returned to Sapporo, and used as the community centre. The H≈çheikan was pulled down in order to move to Nakajima Park, and in 1958, the new building was completed at the current place, and opened as the wedding hall and restaurant. In 1964, the H≈çheikan was registered as one of the Important Cultural Properties. The building has been repaired and renovated between 1983 and 1986. The Crown Prince Naruhito visited the H≈çheikan in 1986.  Overview  The balcony and the roof of the H≈çheikan The H≈çheikan is currently the only building used as a wedding hall among the Important Cultural Properties. The building is also the oldest wooden hotel building in existence in Japan. The architecture of the H≈çheikan comprises a few styles. The whole building was constructed in the American style, but the balcony and its accompaniments at the front of the building was constructed in European style. The semicircle roof at the centre of the building has a sculpture, a Japanese traditional fish sculpture usually seen at the roof of Japanese shrines and temples. The colour Ultramarine blue, which was imported from Europe, is painted on the column and window frames. Used as a wedding venue, the H≈çheikan has held wedding ceremonies for over 20,000 couples, as of January 2004. The H≈çheikan has also been a party venue. The restaurant and cafe are also housed in the building, and guests also enjoy snacks. The restaurant serves Japanese and French cuisine, and uses ingredients harvested in Hokkaid≈ç prefecture.Gurunavi Hokkaido The first floor of the building covers 522.94 m¬≤.

Since they are derived from the mesoderm, they have been shown to differentiate into bone, cartilage, muscle, and adipose tissue. MSCs from embryonic sources have shown promise scientifically while creating significant controversy. As a result, many researchers have focused on adult stem cells,Spinal Injury Foundation or stem cells isolated from adult humans that can be transplanted into damaged tissue. Because of their multi-potent capabilities, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) lineages have been used successfully in animal models to regenerate articular cartilage and in human models to regenerate bone. Recent research demonstrates that articular cartilage may be able to be repaired via percutaneous introduction of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC's). Current research Research into MSC's has exploded in recent years. As an example, a PubMed search for the year 1999 reveals about 90 papers published under the MESH heading of ‚ÄúMesenchymal Stem Cells‚Äù, the same search ran for the year 2007 reveals more than 4,000 entries. The most commonly used source of MSC's is bone marrow aspirate. Most of the adult bone marrow consists of blood cells in various stages of differentiation. These marrow components can be divided into plasma, red blood cells, platelets, and nucleated cells. The adult stem cell fraction is present in the nucleated cells of the marrow. Most of these cells are CD34+ heme progenitors (destined to differentiate into blood components), while very few are actually MSC's capable of differentiating into bone, cartilage, or muscle. As a result, that leaves the very small number of MSC's in the marrow as cells capable of differentiating into tissues of interest to joint preservation. Of note, this may be one of the reasons that commercially available centrifuge systems that concentrate marrow nucleated cells have not shown as much promise in animal research for cartilage repair as have approaches where MSC's are expanded in culture to greater numbers. Mesenchymal stem cell applications Marrow nucleated cells are used every day in regenerative orthopedics. The knee microfracture surgery technique relies on the release of these cells into a cartilage lesion to initiate fibrocartilage repair in osteochondral defects. In addition, this cell population has also been shown to assist in the repair of non-union fractures. For this application, bed side centrifugation is commonly used. Again, these techniques produce a very dilute MSC population, usually a yield of 1 in 10,000‚Äì1,000,000 of the nucleated cells. Despite this low number of MSC's, isolated bone marrow nucleated cells implanted into degenerated human peripheral joints have shown some promise for joint repair. As the number of MSC's that can be isolated from bone marrow is fairly limited, most research in cartilage regeneration has focused on the use of culture expanded cells. This method can expand cell numbers by 100-10,000 fold over several weeks. Once these MSCs are ready for re-implanation, they are usually transferred with growth factors to allow for continued cell growth and engraftment to the damaged tissue. At some point, a signal is introduced (either in culture or after transplant to the damaged tissue) for the cells to differentiate into the end tissue (in this discussion, cartilage). Recent developments Until recently, the use of cultured mesenchymal stem cells to regenerate cartilage has been primarily in research with animal models. There are now, however, two published case reports of the above technique being used to successfully regenerate articular and meniscus cartilage in human knees. This technique has yet to be shown effective in a study involving a larger group of patients, however the same team of researchers have published a large safety study (n=227) showing fewer complications than would normally be associated with surgical procedures. Another team used a similar technique for cell extraction and ex vivo expansion but cells were embedded within a collagen gel before being surgically re-implanted. They reported a case study in which a full-thickness defect in the articular cartilage of a human knee was successfully repaired. While the use of cultured mesenchymal stem cells has shown promising results, a more recent study using uncultured MSC's has resulted in full thickness, histologically confirmed hyaline cartilage regrowth. Researchers evaluated the quality of the repair knee cartilage after arthroscopic microdrilling (also microfracture) surgery followed by post- operative injections of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in combination with hyaluronic acid(HA).

It provided the geological key to Alberta's most prolific conventional oil reserves and resulted in a boom in petroleum exploration and development across Western Canada. The discovery transformed the Alberta economy; oil and gas supplanted farming as the primary industry and resulted in the province becoming one of the richest in the country. Nationally, the discovery allowed Canada to become self-sufficient within a decade and ultimately a major exporter of oil. The discovery followed years of exploratory failures throughout the province. Imperial Oil had spent millions of dollars drilling 133 dry holes in the previous years as only minor discoveries were made. Leduc No. 1 discovered that oil was trapped in what became known as the Nisku Formation and resulted in numerous major discoveries across the prairies. Leduc No. 1 produced of oil and of natural gas before it was decommissioned in 1974, and was part of the Leduc-Woodbend oilfield that has produced over of oil total. Billions of investment dollars flowed into Alberta and were followed by massive immigration to the province following the discovery. Alberta's two major cities saw their populations double within a few years. Calgary grew into a major financial centre and within two decades had the highest number of millionaires in Canada, per capita. The provincial capital of Edmonton, immediately northeast of the discovery, became a major petroleum production centre. A farming community with fewer than 900 residents in 1947, Leduc grew to become Alberta's 13th largest city, while several towns, including Devon and Swan Hills, were founded to support workers in the oil and gas industry. Background Oil was known to exist in Alberta for many centuries. First Nations peoples used it to pitch canoes and to act as a medicinal ointment. Pioneer settlers to southern Alberta in the late 19th century noticed that an oily film occasionally covered pools of water, and that the air had unusual odours at times. In 1911, Ontario-born settler William Herron identified the nature of the odours from his time working in oil fields in Pennsylvania. He convinced Calgary businessman Archibald Dingman and Member of Parliament R. B. Bennett to visit the site near Turner Valley. The trio gathered four other investors, formed the Calgary Petroleum Products Company, Ltd. and began developing the region in search of oil. The company drilled three wells beginning in 1913, and on May 14, 1914, the third struck a significant reserve at a depth of . Excitement reached a fevered pitch in Calgary once word of the Turner Valley strike reached town. Over 500 oil exploration companies were formed within days, the majority of which existed only to bilk unwitting citizens by selling shares in companies that owned no land and had no intention of drilling for oil. In fact, oil was not discovered initially, but rather naphtha ‚Äì a form of natural gas ‚Äì and Calgary settled into an economic recession that accompanied the outset of the First World War. A second major natural gas discovery brought renewed interest in 1924 when the Royalite No. 4 well blew in with a mammoth fire that burned uncontrolled for nearly a month. This find was made at a depth of . The new discovery resulted in the drilling of hundreds of wells in the region over the next 20 years. The first major crude oil discovery at Turner Valley was made in 1936 at a depth of , the deepest well in Alberta at the time. The Turner Valley oil field reached a peak production of in 1942, four years after it was recognized as the largest oil field in the British Empire. In the 30 years following the initial discovery of 1914, oil companies spent over $150 million on exploration and development but found no major reserves of note. The provincial government resorted to subsidies and tax relief for companies to encourage further exploration. Imperial Oil alone had drilled 133 wildcat wells throughout the province, all of which failed to yield significant quantities of oil. By the mid-1940s, the company neared the decision of abandoning the search for oil in the province in favour of focusing on the production synthetic gasoline out of natural gas. While the majority of the company's efforts drilled down only into Cretaceous levels where the Turner Valley strike was discovered, some of Imperial's geologists believed that greater reserves could be found deeper below the earth's surface. They convinced the company's technical committee to attempt one more deep drilling effort. Imperial's board of directors reluctantly supported the new effort, but made it known that this well, initially known as Wildcat No. 134, would be the company's last-chance effort. Discovery Imperial's chief geologist, Ted Link, was among those who believed oil could be found at a much greater depth and had already met with success drilling at Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories. He had his staff determine the best location for the new well. The majority of the team favoured a triangular area that stretched between Calgary and Edmonton in central Alberta, up to Grande Prairie in the northwest. The company then set out to acquire surface lease rights to tracts of land in the region. Imperial acquired rights to over 200,000 acres of land southwest of Edmonton by the end of spring and began surveying the area for the best place to begin drilling. Seismic tests produced two possible candidates: one near the village of Leduc and another farther to the southwest near Pigeon Lake. alt=A pyramid-shaped steel lattice structure extends several hundred metres into the air. It stands on a wood and steel platform and has walkways at both the midpoint and top.Though the Pigeon Lake spot was viewed by geologists as a more promising location, the team chose Leduc due to the location's proximity to major roadways and the North Saskatchewan River. This decision proved fortuitous, as a later effort by Imperial to drill at Pigeon Lake resulted in another dry hole. The farmstead of Mike Turta, 15 km west of Leduc, was chosen as the drilling site. As Turta lacked mineral rights, Imperial initially paid him only $250 per year to lease his land. Imperial brought Vern Hunter, nicknamed \\"Dry Hole\\" as a result of his numerous past failures, to lead the drilling team. Hunter was skeptical that the new site would lead to success. He expected it would fail like previous ventures and that Imperial would then limit its focus to Alberta's natural gas fields. The drilling site was a true wildcat ‚Äì no other wells drilled within of Turta's farm ‚Äì and Imperial was willing to go as deep as in this search. Drilling of Leduc No. 1 began November 20, 1946. Several drill stem tests down to depths of showed only traces of oil and natural gas. As drilling passed into Mesozoic depths, tests indicated large quantities of natural gas and some oil. It was a small find, and close to the limits of the Paleozoic Era, where conventional wisdom of the time held that oil was unlikely to be found. Imperial was left to choose whether to begin production of this small find, or drill deeper and risk having the byproducts of drilling ruin the company's ability to complete a well at the depth of this find. Imperial chose to continue drilling. When drilling reached , into the Devonian Era, tests showed promising results. On February 3, 1947, a test sent a geyser shooting out of the drilling hole and up half the height of the drilling derrick, covering a worker with oil. By this point, Imperial knew they had hit upon a strike. The company pressed Hunter to name a date when the well could come in. He later stated: \\"The crew and I were experts at abandoning wells but we didn't know much about completing them. I named February 13 and started praying.\\" Imperial invited the public to witness as the well came in. However, the machinery broke down on that morning. The crew worked most of the day trying to fix the machinery, while some of guests began to leave, fearing another disappointment. Shortly before 4 p.m., the crew finally cleared the wellhead and the 500 people who remained despite the bitter cold bore witness as Leduc No. 1 came to life. People felt a rumbling in the ground, while roughnecks opened release valves. The youngest member of the crew was given the honour of \\"flaring\\" the well. As the mixture of crude oil and gas spewed from a release pipe, the young man hurled a burning sack onto the mixture, igniting the fuel and sending flames into the air. Imperial held a party in Edmonton that night in celebration of its achievement. Geologic breakthrough The discovery at Leduc was actually a stroke of good fortune because geologists had chosen the location on the basis of theories that were later shown to be incorrect. The search for large oil reservoirs in Alberta had been ongoing for decades because the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin that lies beneath the majority of the Canadian Prairies was known to be prime ground for the formation of petroleum and natural gas, and it was unlikely that such a prime setting would have produced only the two oil fields that were known to exist in 1946. At that time, geologists believed that rocks of Early Cretaceous age had the greatest potential to contain oil and natural gas, and the Leduc area appeared to be a good location from which to reach those rocks. Earlier discoveries in Texas and at Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories had shown that oil could also be found in Devonian-age reefs, but the prevailing opinion was that Alberta had been a desert at that time so such reefs were unlikely to be present. It was later shown that much of Alberta was actually a marine basin fringed by reefs and lagoons during Late Devonian time and was therefore very likely to host porous, hydrocarbon-containing reefs like those at Norman Wells. The understanding of the Norman Wells field, which Imperial had located in the 1920s, helped provide the geological key to unlock Leduc,McKenzie-Brown From North to South: How Norman Wells Led to Leduc and twenty years after the initial discovery at Leduc No. 1, dozens of oil-bearing Devonian reefs had been discovered throughout western Canada. Leduc-Woodbend oil field Imperial had already begun testing for a second well, to the southwest of Leduc No. 1. Leduc No. 2 was spudded on February 12, 1947. By May it had reached the same depth as No. 1 but little oil was found. The company worried that Leduc was only a minor oil field, but decided to continue to drill deeper. At a depth of , the well broke through into a reservoir even larger than the one at Leduc No. 1. Leduc No. 3 came in on the same day, May 21, 1947, ushering in Alberta's oil boom. Within weeks, more than a dozen companies were drilling throughout the region, and by the end of 1947 there were 31 operational wells in the area, 24 of them owned by Imperial Oil. The depth at which Leduc No. 1 struck oil was designated the Devonian D-2, formally called the Nisku Formation, while Nos. 2 and 3 had reached the Devonian D-3, or Leduc Formation. However, it was still many years before the nature of the Devonian reefs was fully understood. In 1949, the majority of wells drilled were dry; only 26 of 107 wildcat wells drilled that year became producers of oil or gas. Other major discoveries followed Leduc. A second field called Woodbend was discovered by Imperial north of the initial find. The two fields were combined to form the Leduc-Woodbend oil field, and within a decade it was the third largest oil field in Canada. Imperial discovered a larger field northeast of Edmonton near the village of Redwater in 1948. Gulf Canada discovered a major field near Stettler in the central part of the province in 1950. In 1951, Texaco made two significant discoveries in the area around Wizard Lake, immediately south of Leduc-Woodbend. The Pembina oil field, the largest in Alberta, was discovered in 1953 near the town of Drayton Valley. Production Canada produced only of oil per day in 1946, most of it in Turner Valley, but consumed ten times that amount. Alberta's annual total production in 1946 was from 416 wells. Over ninety percent of the nation's oil requirements were imported from the United States. One decade later, Canada was producing sixty-five percent natively, despite a three-fold increase in consumption. Overall production had increased to nearly from 7,390 productive wells, and Alberta produced per day with the capability of doubling that total. The discoveries led to rapidly increasing estimates of Western Canada's reserves. The region was estimated to have recoverable in 1946. That figure was increased to in 1957. It is currently believed that Western Canada has as much as of oil in conventional reserves (i.e.: excluding the Athabasca Oil Sands), though the vast majority of that total is unrecoverable by current technology. Drilling activity in the Leduc-Woodbend field peaked in 1951 and exploratory drilling of the field had largely ended by 1955. The field produced of oil in 1948, surpassing total production of Turner Valley within one year. The field peaked at over annually between 1953 and 1956 before gradually declining. Overall, the Leduc-Woodbend field produced over in its first 50 years of operation. Leduc No. 1 itself was operational until 1974. During its 27-year lifespan, the well produced of oil and over of natural gas. Impact Population growth The discovery of Leduc No. 1 led to a rapid population boom in Alberta. The 1948 blowout of the nearby Atlantic No. 3 well aided provincial growth as the derrick collapse and resulting inferno made international headlines and alerted the world to Alberta's oil strikes. Alberta's population in 1946 was 803,000, compared to neighbouring Saskatchewan's total of 833,000. At the 1951 census, Alberta's population had grown to 940,000 while Saskatchewan remained stagnant. The 1951 census also made note of the transformation the province was undergoing, as the urban population outnumbered the rural for the first time in the province's history. Alberta's population grew by another 400,000 throughout the 1950s. The Government of Alberta attempted to manage growth and hoped to prevent the risk of so-called resource towns from turning into ghost towns once the oil boom passed them by, as had happened to turn-of-the-century coal mining towns across the province. The planned town of Devon, located west of Edmonton, was founded in 1949 by Imperial Oil with the assistance of the province to provide housing and services for workers of the Leduc-Woodbend oil field. Drayton Valley was the province's first model oil town as the government organized the rapid growth the hamlet of less than 100 people experienced beginning in 1954 following the discovery of the nearby Pembina oil field the year previous. Similar communities followed, including Swan Hills, which incorporated as a town in 1967. Calgary and Edmonton The already intense rivalry between the cities of Calgary and Edmonton increased following the discovery at Leduc No. 1 as both communities attempted to proclaim themselves the \\"oil capital of Canada\\". Edmonton, it was said, would have been only a \\"quiet administrative centre\\" if not for the discoveries made in the regions surrounding the city. The city became increasingly blue collar following Leduc as oil workers moved into the city. The city's population rose rapidly; Edmonton's 226,000 residents in 1956 was double that of the census ten years previous, while the city grew by an additional 55,000 by 1961. Edmonton has become one of the world's premier operations and service centres for the petroleum industry. It has fabrication and manufacturing capacity that would be the envy of virtually any other oilfield service centre. The University of Alberta is a jewel in the city's crown, and it has been a centre of oilsands research since the 1920s. The area is Alberta's refining and petrochemical centre ‚Äì notably the \\"Industrial Heartland\\" northeast of Edmonton. That industrial region has grown organically since the late 1940s, when Imperial Oil brought a tin-pot World War II refinery down from Whitehorse to process crude from Leduc and the other new fields. Now the beneficiary of more than $25 billion in investment, this 582-square-kilometre region hosts 40 large companies and many small ones. Together they operate refineries and petrochemical plants, an upgrader, pipelines, service companies and numerous other interdependent businesses. However, while many petroleum-related workers and facilities are now located in Edmonton, corporate offices remained in Calgary. Many oil companies had placed their offices in the southern city following the Turner Valley discovery and made no effort to relocate even as drilling and exploration moved north. Consequently, the oil money flowed through Calgary. By 1967, the city had more millionaires than any other in the country, per capita, and more cars per person than any city in the world. Today it is possible to imagine Calgary - which has the planet's greatest concentration of energy-related knowledge in its downtown core - becoming a serious rival to Houston as the energy capital of the world.McKenzie-Brown, Calgary Rising Oilweek, November 2011 Canadian Energy Museum Leduc No. 1 and the Leduc-Woodbend oil field were designated a National Historic Site in 1990. The Leduc #1 Energy Discovery Centre opened in 1997 and features exhibits about Canada's oil industry, including artifacts, photos and oilfield equipment. In 2019, the Centre was rebranded as the Canadian Energy Museum, with a broader focus on the Canadian energy industry as a whole .
