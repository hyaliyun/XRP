The CRS includes a High-Energy Telescope System (HETS), Low-Energy Telescope System (LETS), and The Electron Telescope (TET). It is designed to detect energetic particles and some of the requirements were for the instrument to be reliable and to have enough charge resolution. It can also detect the energetic particles like protons from the Galaxy or Earth's Sun. As of 2019, CRS is one of the active remaining instruments on both Voyager spacecraft, and it is described by as being able to detect electrons from 3‚Äì110 MeV and cosmic ray nuclei 1‚Äì500 MeV/n. All three systems used solid-state detectors. CRS is one of the five fields and particle experiments on each spacecraft, and one of the goals is to gain a deeper understanding of the solar wind. Other objects of study including electrons and nuclei from planetary magnetospheres and from outside the solar system. In the summer of 2019, the heater for the CRS on Voyager 2 was turned off to save power, however, although it cooled off it was still returning data at a new lower temperature outside its original operating range. The amount of power on the Voyager spacecraft has been slowly decreasing, so various items of equipment are turned off to save power. Overview The CRS is detecting extremely small particles as might be detected in a bubble chamber or cloud chamber, which can show the tracks certain particles make as they travel because they trigger little bubbles despite being of atomic size. Areas of original study for this investigation: *origin and acceleration process, life history, and dynamic contribution of interstellar cosmic rays, *nucleosynthesis of elements in cosmic-ray sources *behavior of cosmic rays in the interplanetary medium *trapped planetary energetic particle environment. High-Energy Telescope System: *6 and 500 MeV/nucleon for atomic numbers from 1 through 30 *Electrons from 3 and 100 MeV Low-Energy Telescope System: *0.15 and 30 MeV/nucleon for atomic numbers from 1 to 30. *Measures anisotropies of electrons and nuclei. Electron Telescope (TET): *The TET measures the energy spectrum of electrons from 3 to 110 MeV. The TET consists of eight solid state detectors with different thicknesses of tungsten between each detector. The detectors and tungsten layers are stacked one on top of each other. The tungsten layers range from 0.56 mm to 2.34 mm thick and function as absorbers. Each TET solid state detector has an area of 4.5 cm2 and is 3 mm thick. The P.I. is Prof. Edward C. Stone, Jr. The CRS was tested to operate down to a temperature of minus 49 degrees F (minus 59 degrees C) during its development in the 1970s.  Operating Temperature  During its development the CRS was rated to operated down to a temperature of minus 49 degrees F (minus 59 degrees C). Up until 2019 the instrument was operated on both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, however in the summer of 2019 there was need to save some power on Voyager 2. The heater for the CRS was turned off at this time, which caused a lowering of the CRS temperature to below its lowest rated operating temperature. The device cooled down to minus 74 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 59 degrees Celsius) but it still continued to operate at this temperature. Results This shows cosmic ray hits as recorded by Voyager 1 from 2011‚Äì2012, a time when it is thought to have finally exited the Heliosphere A view of the outer solar system as discovered by Voyager as of June 2013 Voyager 2 is reported as leaving the heliosphere on November 5, 2018. In 1977 the spectra of Helium (He), Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Neon during the solar minimum was measured using the CRS instrument on the Voyagers that year. The solar minimum of 1977 occurred towards the end of year, and it was possible to observe both interplanetary, galactic, and anomalous energy spectras. In the early 1980s, the CRS detected charged particles around Saturn. It detected a 0.43 million volt flux of protons as it traveled through Saturn's magnetosphere. In the 1980s the CRS data from both Voyagers was used to determine the abundances of energetic particles from the Sun and additional information. Another area studied in the 1980s using CRS data was variation in Galactic cosmic rays in the outer Heliosphere CRS helped predict that Voyager 1 and 2 would cross the Solar system's termination shock in 2003. This helped support the later conclusion that Voyager 1 crossed the termination shock in December 2004 and that Voyager 2 crossed it in August 2007. In 2011, CRS data along with the Voyager Magnetometer discovered an area where the solar wind was not going in either direction. The area was identified as a sort of charged particle doldrums, where the particles from the solar system are pushed back by cosmic forces. At a distance of 17 light-hours Voyager 1 was commanded to rotate several times (in the other direction then its spinning), to make detection in other directions. It was determined that in 2012 Voyager 1 entered interstellar space, that is it entered the interstellar medium between the stars. One of the reasons this was recognized was a significant increase in galactic cosmic rays. In 2013 CRS data lead some to propose that Voyager 1 had entered a \\"transition zone\\" as it leaves the Heliosphere. There was some changes in the amounts and type of detections that triggered deeper analysis. The results from the magnetometer muddied the waters of interpretation. Other scientists proposed that this indicated a departure from the solar system in the sense that it had left the Sun's heliosphere. The issue was the interpretation of the drop in cosmic rays, which happened at 123 AU from the Sun for Voyager 2 that year. The many revelations and restructured understandings as the Voyagers head out, as influenced by data from the CRS and other active instruments, was called by Nature publication as the \\"long goodbye\\". The CRS on Voyager 2, helped identify that spacecraft's departure from the Sun's heliosphere in 2018. CRS location Labeled diagram, with CRS on the boom on the right, but to the left of the cameras.

Written early in his career, the play won Poliakoff the Evening Standard Theatre Award for Most Promising Playwright.Nelson, Robin (2014). Stephen Poliakoff on Stage and Screen. pp. 13; 73‚Äì76. Methuen. The critic Michael Billington said it was \\"reminder of Poliakoff's precocious talent\\". In the original production Judy Monahan and James Aubrey played the lead roles and were supported by Lynne Miller. It was a shocking play in its time partly because it dealt with an incestuous relationship between a brother and sister. Hitting Town was developed into a television play with Thames Television for ITV Plays For Britain. The television adaptation was half shot on location on single-camera video and the other half in the studio using multiple cameras. Directed by theatre director Peter Gill, it stars Mick Ford and Deborah Norton with Lynne Miller repeating her stage performance as the rebellious waitress, Nicola. Hitting Town was released for the first time on DVD in 2013.  Storyline  Hitting Town is a play of just seven juxtaposed scenes, loosely shaped around a visit by Ralph to his sister Clare‚Äôs flat in their home town, Leicester. Clare is depressed having recently split up with her boyfriend. Ralph offers to take her out, ‚Äòhitting the town‚Äô as it were. The brother and sister travel through a landscape of Wimpy bars, shopping malls, subterranean discos, ending up in bed together. Set at the time of the Guildford and Birmingham bombings the play creates a feel for the contemporary mid-1970s. Poliakoff described the atmosphere of the time, ‚Äòas you walked down the streets you expected cars to blow up in front of you‚Äô (1997).  Controversy  Though not sexually explicit, the television adaptation of Hitting Town caused a considerable stir in 1976. Mary Whitehouse tried to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority prosecuted for screening the show. The matter was referred to the Attorney General.

In early June 1941, 359th HAA Bty was relieved at Derby and took over two sites at Nottingham to allow 362 HAA Bty of 113th HAA Rgt to attend a practice camp. Then in September 359th Bty transferred to 60th (City of London) HAA Rgt covering the Firth of Clyde in Scotland under the command of 42nd AA Bde in 12th AA Division.Frederick, p. 770.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80. Static 3.7-inch HAA gun At the beginning of 1942 the battery was firing at No 2 AA Practice Camp at Burrow Head, and then took over two gun sites at Irvine, North Ayrshire. Site IC1 had emplacements for four guns, but only two 3.7-inch mobile guns were in position, while IC2 had four static 3.7-inch guns and a GLII gun-laying radar. Although 60th HAA Rgt remained in 42nd AA Bde, 359th Bty was attached to 63 AA Bde, which covered Western Scotland.359 HAA Bty War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7568.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81. The battery continued training on the guns, radar and semi-automatic plotter at Irvine until May, when it received a warning order to prepare for overseas service. On 15 May it entrained for London to proceed to the RA Depot at Woolwich together with B and C Troops from 205 LAA Bty of 84th LAA Rgt, also in 63 AA Bde. They became B and C Trps of 359 Bty, which came under direct War Office Control in June. That month it travelled to Avonmouth Docks to embark on HM Transport F9, with a strength of 10 officers and 275 other ranks, forming part of Force 122.

Force 122 40 mm Bofors LAA gun The purpose of the deployment was to stiffen the defences of Port Stanley, an advanced naval base with communication and fuelling facilities, which had been significant during the Battle of the River Plate, and which might be threatened by the Japanese. Previously its defence had rested with the local Falkland Islands Defence Force (FIDF), a few coast defence guns, and such ships of the Royal Navy as were there at any one time.Routledge, p. 204 GL Mk II radar receiver van Force 122 consisted of 11th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, 359th HAA Bty, and supporting units of the Royal Engineers, Royal Army Service Corps, Royal Army Ordnance Corps and Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. 359th HAA Bty brought with it eight 40 mm Bofors LAA guns equipped with Predictor No.3 (the Kerrison Predictor), and four static 3.7-inch HAA guns with instruments including a GLII radar. The guns were concentrated at the Port Stanley installations, where the HAA guns could also join the coast artillery fire plan. The ground was rough and boggy with rocky outcrops, and the battery commander found it difficult to select good sites. A level area had to be dug out for the GLII set. By 14 August the Bofors guns were ready on three positions covering the radio station and oil tanks. However, work was not completed on the static 3.7-inch gun site in Murray Heights ('Brooke Camp', named after General Sir Alan Brooke) and the wire mesh radar 'mat' until December. The position was occupied on 15 December, and in January 1943 the 3.7s carried out proof firing in the presence of the Governor. A semi- automatic plotter was installed for 'unseen' engagement of targets using radar alone.Routledge, p. 393. Aerial photo of a GL radar mat. There were practice shoots, exercises, calibration and barrage rehearsals throughout 1943, but no hostile aircraft appeared. In October 1943 the battery took over responsibility for coast radar. But in December 1943 Force 122 was ordered to return to the UK, to be replaced by the smaller Force 132. 259th HAA Battery passed two Bofors guns to the FIDF, while the rest of the equipment was stored or removed. After a farewell parade for the Governor, the battery embarked for home in February 1944. Disbandment The battery disembarked from HM Transport F2 at Liverpool on 17 March 1944 and proceeded to Grasmere in Westmorland, where disembarkation leave began. On 15 April the order was received to disband the battery. The officers and some 80 specialist other ranks were posted to RA units; of the remaining other ranks, 131 were posted to infantry training centres, and 42 to the Royal Army Service Corps. 359th HAA Battery completed its disbandment on 15 May 1944.359 HAA Bty War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 166/14849.

They are widely used to disinfect water, medical equipment, and surface areas as well as bleaching materials such as cloth. The presence of organic matter can make them less effective as disinfectants. They come as a liquid solution, or as a powder that is mixed with water before use. Side effects if contact occurs may include skin irritation and chemical burns to the eye. They may also cause corrosion and therefore may require being rinsed off. Specific compounds in this family include sodium hypochlorite, monochloramine, halazone, chlorine dioxide, and sodium dichloroisocyanurate. They are effective against a wide variety of microorganisms including bacterial spores. Chlorine-releasing compounds first came into use as bleaching agents around 1785, and as disinfectants in 1915. They are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. They are used extensively in both the medical and the food industry. Uses Chlorine-based compounds are usually handled in water solutions, powders, or tablets, that are mixed with water before use. They may have to be rinsed off after application to avoid corrosion of metals and degradation of organic materials. Disinfectants Chlorine-based compounds are effective against a wide variety of microorganisms including bacterial spores. They are listed by the World Health Organization as essential medicines in any health system. They are easy to use, widely available, and very cheap: as of 2014, the wholesale cost of chloramine-T in the developing world was US$0.01‚Äì0.02 per 500 mg tablet. The presence of other organic matter in the place of application can make these disinfectants less effective, by consuming some of the released chlorine. Whitening agents Chlorine-based bleaches have been used since the late 18th century to whiten cotton and linen clothes, removing either the natural fiber color or stains of sweat or other organic residues. They are still used in households for laundry and to remove organic stains (such as mildew) on surfaces. Colors of natural materials typically arise from organic pigments, such as beta carotene. Chlorine-based compounds work by breaking the chemical bonds that make up the pigment's chromophore. This changes the molecule into a different substance that either does not contain a chromophore, or contains a chromophore that does not absorb visible light. Industrially, chlorine-based bleaches are used in a wide variety of processes, including bleaching of wood pulp. Safety Chlorine-releasing products present significant risks. It is estimated that, in 2002, there were about 3300 accidents needing hospital treatment caused by liquid bleach in British homes, and about 160 due to bleaching powder.Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (2002): 24th Report of the Home and Leisure Accident Surveillance System (HASS)., page 150. Accessed on 2018-06-18. Chemical burns Chlorine releasing solutions, such as liquid bleach and solutions of bleaching powder, can burn the skin and cause eye damage, especially when used in concentrated forms. As recognized by the NFPA, however, only solutions containing more than 40% sodium hypochlorite by weight are considered hazardous oxidizers. Solutions less than 40% are classified as a moderate oxidizing hazard (NFPA 430, 2000). Release of chlorine gas Mixing a hypochlorite bleach with an acid can liberate chlorine gas. Chlorine is a respiratory irritant that attacks mucous membranes and burns the skin. As little as 3.53 ppm can be detected as an odor, and 1000 ppm is likely to be fatal after a few deep breaths. Exposure to chlorine has been limited to 0.5 ppm (8-hour time-weighted average‚Äî38-hour week) by the U. S. OSHAOSHA (2018): \\"Table Z-1\\". Appendix to Permissible Exposure Limits ‚Äì Annotated Tables. Published by U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Accessed on 2018-06-18. Due to transport and handling safety concerns, the use of sodium hypochlorite is preferred over chlorine gas in water treatment. Reaction with other products Chlorine releasing compounds can react with other common household chemicals like vinegar or ammonia to produce toxic gases. Mixing an acid cleaner with a hypochlorite bleach can cause toxic chlorine gas to be released. The hypochlorite anion and chlorine are in equilibrium in water; the position of the equilibrium is pH dependent and low pH (acidic) favors chlorine, : Cl2 \\\\+ H2O 2H+ \\\\+ Cl‚àí \\\\+ ClO‚àí A hypochlorite bleach can react violently with hydrogen peroxide and produce oxygen gas: :H2O2(aq) + NaOCl (aq) ‚Üí NaCl (aq) + H2O(l) + O2(g) A 2008 study indicated that sodium hypochlorite and organic chemicals (e.g., surfactants, fragrances) contained in several household cleaning products can react to generate chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs).Mustafa Odabasi (2008): \\"Halogenated Volatile Organic Compounds from the Use of Chlorine-Bleach-Containing Household Products\\". Environmental Science & Technology, volume 42, issue 5, pages 1445‚Äì1451. These chlorinated compounds are emitted during cleaning applications, some of which are toxic and probable human carcinogens. The study showed that indoor air concentrations significantly increase (8‚Äì52 times for chloroform and 1‚Äì1170 times for carbon tetrachloride, respectively, above baseline quantities in the household) during the use of bleach containing products. The increase in chlorinated volatile organic compound concentrations was the lowest for plain bleach and the highest for the products in the form of \\"thick liquid and gel.\\" The significant increases observed in indoor air concentrations of several chlorinated VOCs (especially carbon tetrachloride and chloroform) indicate that the bleach use may be a source that could be important in terms of inhalation exposure to these compounds. The authors suggested that using these cleaning products may significantly increase the cancer risk. The hypochlorites in liquid bleach and bleaching powder can react with ammonia to form a number of products, including monochloramine (), then dichloramine () and finally nitrogen trichloride ().Similar reactions may occur with amines or related compounds and biological materials (such as urine). The result depends on the temperature, concentration, and how they are mixed. These compounds are very irritating to the eyes and lungs and are toxic above certain concentrations. Chronic exposure, for example, from the air at swimming pools where chlorine is used as the disinfectant, can lead to the development of atopic asthma. Nitrogen trichloride is also a very sensitive explosive. Corrosion Chlorine releasing products may also cause corrosion of many materials and unintended bleaching of colored products.  Neutralization  Sodium thiosulfate is an effective chlorine neutralizer. Rinsing with a 5 mg/L solution, followed by washing with soap and water, will remove chlorine odor from the hands. Main compounds Specific compounds in this family include: * Sodium hypochlorite, . This is the most common chlorine-releasing bleaching and disinfection compound. A dilute (3‚Äì6%) solution in water, historically known as Eau de Labarraque or \\"Labarraque's water\\", is widely marketed as a household cleaning product, under the name \\"liquid bleach\\" or simply \\"bleach\\". More concentrated solutions are used to disinfect drinking water and as bleaching agents in industrial processes. A more diluted solution (up to 0.5%) has been in use since 1915 to cleanse and disinfect wounds, under the name of Dakin's solution.Marcel Daufresne (1916), \\"Mode de pr√©paration de l'hypochlorite de soude chirurgical - Differ√©nce entre la soulution de Dakin et celle de Labarraque\\". Presse m√©dicale, volume xxiv, page 474.Henry D. Dakin (1915): \\"On the use of certain antiseptic substances in the treatment of infected wounds\\". British Medical Journal, volume 2, issue 2852, pages 318‚Äì310.H. D. Dakin and E. K. Kunham (1918). A Handbook of Antiseptics. Published by Macmillan, New York. * Calcium hypochlorite, . This product, known as \\"bleaching powder\\" or \\"chlorinated lime\\", it is used in many of the same applications as sodium hypochlorite, but is more stable and contains more available chlorine. It is usually marketed as a white powder that contains, besides the hypochlorite, also calcium hydroxide (\\"lime\\") and calcium chloride .Vogt, H.; Balej, J.; Bennett, J. E.; Wintzer, P.; Sheikh, S. A.; Gallone, P.; Vasudevan, S.; Pelin, K. (2010). \\"Chlorine Oxides and Chlorine Oxygen Acids\\". Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley- VCH. A purer, more stable form of calcium hypochlorite is called HTH or high test hypochlorite. It is also available as bleaching tablets that contain calcium hypochlorite and other ingredients to prevent the tablets from crumbling. A supposedly more stable mixture of calcium hypochlorite and quicklime (calcium oxide) is known as \\"tropical bleach\\". Percent active chlorine in these materials ranges from 20% for bleaching powder to 70% for HTH. * Potassium hypochlorite, . This was the first chlorine-based bleaching agent, which became available around 1785 under the name Eau de Javel or \\"Javel water\\". It is no longer commonly used, having been superseded by the cheaper sodium analog. * Chloramine, . This chemical is commonly handled as a dilute water solution. It is used as an alternative to chlorine and sodium hypochlorite for disinfection of drinking water and swimming pools. * Chloramine-T, or tosylchloramide sodium salt, . This solid compound is available in tablet or powder form, and used in medical establishments to disinfect surfaces, equipment, and instruments. * Sodium dichloroisocyanurate . This solid compound, available as tablets, is widely used as a disinfectant, to sterilize drinking water, swimming pools, tableware, farming installations, and air; and as an industrial deodorant. It is also used for bleaching textiles. * Halazone, or 4-((dichloroamino)sulfonyl)benzoic acid, . This compound was for a while used to disinfect drinking water in field situations, but has largely been replaced in that use by sodium dichloroisocyanurate. * Chlorine dioxide, . This is an unstable gas, which is usually prepared in situ or stored as dilute aqueous solutions. Despite these limitations it finds large-scale applications for the bleaching of wood pulp, fats and oils, cellulose, flour, textiles, beeswax, skin, and in a number of other industries. It has also been used for chlorination of tap water. Mechanism of action Chlorine-releasing bleaches and disinfectants depend on the strong reactivity of chlorine towards many organic compounds; in particular, its strong oxidizing character, that is, its strong affinity for electrons. It readily inserts itself into double bonds, including those of aromatic rings, creating chlorinated organic compound. This accounts for its bleaching action, since many colored organic substances owe their color to compounds with such bonds. The extensive reactivity of chlorine is also responsible for its broad antimicrobial effect, since it can destroy or denature many proteins and other chemicals that are essential for microbes' metabolism.  Free chlorine  The strength of chlorine-releasing solutions, as well as their dosage in uses like water chlorination and pool sanitization, is usually expressed as mass concentration of \\"free chlorine\\" or \\"available chlorine\\". It is the mass of chlorine gas (Cl2) that would yield the same oxidizing power as the product contained in (or applied to) a specific mass or volume of the liquid in question. The concentration can be expressed, for example, as grams per liter (g/L), milligrams per liter (mg/L), or parts per million (ppm). Thus, for example, \\"15 mg/L of available chlorine\\" means that the amount of product contained in one liter of the liquid has the same oxidizing power as 15 mg of chlorine. The strength of commercial chlorine-releasing products may be instead specified as the concentration of the active ingredient, as mass or weight percent or grams per liter. In order to determine the free chlorine content of the product, one must take into account the oxidizing reactions that the ingredient may undergo in the application. For example, the label of a household bleach product may specify \\"5% sodium hypochlorite by weight.\\" That would mean that 1 kilogram of the product contains 0.05 √ó 1000 g = 50 g of . A typical oxidation reaction is the conversion of iodide to elemental iodine . The relevant reactions are : + 2 + 2 ‚Üí + + : + 2 + 2 ‚Üí 2 + + That is, one \\"molecule\\" of has the same oxidizing power as one molecule of . Their molar masses are 74.44 g and 70.90 g, respectively. Therefore, 1 kilogram of the solution has 1000 √ó 0.05 √ó 70.90/74.44 = 47.62 g of \\"free chlorine\\". In order to convert between mass ratios and mass per volume, one must take into account the density of the liquid in question. For chlorinated water, one can assume the density is the same as of pure water, about 1000 g/L (more precisely, about 997 g/L at 25 ¬∞C). For more concentrated solutions like liquid bleach, the density depends on the ingredients and their concentrations, and is usually obtained from tables. When diluting a product, one must be aware that the volume of the diluted solution may not be the sum of the volumes of product and water. For example, one ml of 5.25 wt% NaClO bleach added to ten liters of water, will yield a NaClO concentration of about 5.76 mg/L, and 5.48 mg/L of free chlorine. History Swedish chemist Scheele discovered chlorine in 1774, and in 1785 French scientist Claude Louis Berthollet recognized that it could be used to bleach fabrics. Berthollet also discovered potassium hypochlorite, which became the first commercial bleaching product, named Eau de Javel (\\"Javel water\\") after the borough in Paris where it was produced. Scottish chemist and industrialist Charles Tennant proposed in 1798 a solution of calcium hypochlorite as an alternative for Javel water, and patented bleaching powder (a solid product containing calcium hypochlorite) in 1799. Around 1820, French chemist Labarraque discovered the disinfecting ability of hypochlorites, and popularized the use of the cheaper sodium hypochlorite solution (known as Eau de Labarraque, \\"Labarraque's water\\") throughout the world for that purpose.Scott, James, transl. (1828). On the disinfecting properties of Labarraque's preparations of chlorine Published by S. Highley. His work greatly improved medical practice, public health, the sanitary conditions in hospitals, slaughterhouses, and all industries dealing with animal products‚Äîdecades before Pasteur and others established the germ theory of disease.Labarraque, Antoine-Germain, Nouvelle biographie g√©n√©rale, volume 28 (1859), columns 323-324. In particular, it led to the nearly universal practice of chlorination of tap water to prevent the spread of diseases like typhoid fever and cholera.Reece, R.J. (1907). \\"Report on the Epidemic of Enteric Fever in the City of Lincoln, 1904-5.\\" In Thirty-Fifth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1905-6: Supplement Containing the Report of the Medical Officer for 1905-6. London: Local Government Board. In 1915, British chemist Henry Dakin, working at a field hospital in France during World War I, did an extensive study of compounds that could be used to disinfect wounds and prevent sepsis. He found that chloramine was optimal, but settled for a dilute sodium hypochlorite solution‚Äîstill used today with the name of \\"Dakin's solution\\"‚Äîfor reasons of cost and availability.

She created a methodical training system which was implemented in many schools of Russian Empire. In 1862, she organized the first free girls' school in Ukraine. In 1889, she was elected vice-president of the International League of Education in Paris. Khrystyna Alchevska Biography Khrystyna was born 16 April 1841 in Borzna, Chernihiv gubernia, now in Ukraine. She married Alexey (Oleksii) K. Alchevsky, a Ukrainian businessman, later owner of a large mine and steel plant. Their children numbered many talented and accomplished artists. Son, Ivan Alchevsky, was a renowned opera singer. Daughter, Khrystia Alchevska, was a poet. Son, Hryhorii Alchevsky, was a composer. She lived and worked in Kharkiv where died on 15 August 1920. Professional life Beginning in 1862, she maintained the Kharkiv Women's Sunday School (officially accredited in 1870) at her own expense. The school remained in existence for 50 years and was renowned for its highly developed methods of adult education. Borys Hrinchenko taught at the school as a young man. She was an eminent pedagogue who initiated a method of adult education using literary works, rather than spelling books. In 1889, she attended the Paris Exhibition as the representative of Russian Empire teachers of adult students. She taught classes in Ukrainian until forced by the government to switch to Russian. Alchevska compiled an award-winning methodological and bibliographical guide, What the People Should Read, (Chto chitat‚Äô narodu) in 1906. This work earned the grand prize at the Paris International Exhibition, and a teaching manual, Book for Adults (Kniga vzroslykh) in 1900. She also wrote a memoir, My Thoughts and Experiences (\\"Peredumannoe i perezhitoe), in 1912. She also published several methodological articles on adult education. In the 1860s, Alchevska's articles appeared in Aleksandr Herzen's journal Kolokol, under the pseudonym Ukrainka. Alchevska encouraged girls and women to dress in traditional regional costumes at community festivals and to perform folksongs. She wore peasant costume as a symbol of her dedication to the people she taught. Her adaptation of folk culture and folk art helped peasants adjust to city life. Legacy In 1963, O. Mazurkevych published a book on the educational work of Alchevska and her colleagues.

Located on historic Whiskey Row in Prescott, the saloon was opened in 1877, and rebuilt in 1901 after a disastrous fire swept the district in 1900. It is considered one of the most historic bars in the state. History Outdoor sign In 1867, three years after the founding of the city, D.C. Thorne purchased the lot on which the saloon would later be built. In 1877, Thorne built the saloon and named it The Palace Saloon; it was one of over forty bars which stood next to one another on Whiskey Row in Prescott. Over the course of its history it has seen such famous patrons as Wyatt Earp, Virgil Earp, Doc Holliday (in the 1870s before they headed south to Tombstone), and Steve McQueen. During his time in Prescott before leaving for Tombstone, Wyatt Earp was involved in several gunfights behind the saloon, killing two men. Holliday also killed a man in the saloon during a knife fight. Thorne owned the property until it was destroyed in a fire in 1883, after which the property was sold to Robert Brow, who rebuilt the saloon, with innovations intended to make the structure less prone to fire, including a stone foundation and an iron roof. When it re- opened in 1884 it had the new hand-carved Brunswick bar, several chandeliers, three gaming tables and two club rooms. Along with the Cabinet Saloon next door, The Palace was considered the finest saloon in Arizona. The saloon was the scene of other violence as well, including the beating death of a sometimes prostitute named Jennie Clark, by her boyfriend Fred Glover. Jennie's real name was Nellie Coyle, and on a night in late August 1884, she and Glover got into a fight at the saloon. During the course of the scuffle, she was knocked down several times, and may have been kicked while on the floor. She died of her injuries that night. Glover was tried and convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to hang. Prior to his execution, Governor Frederick Tritle commuted the sentence to life in prison, which was further reduced in 1889 by the next governor, Oakes Murphy, and Glover was released from prison the following year. A fire swept through Whiskey Row in 1900. During the fire, the patrons of the bar picked up the fancy hand-carved Brunswick bar and carried it out of the burning building. Setting it down across the street, they continued their drinking as the other side of the street burned. The saloon was rebuilt at a cost of $50,000, combining with the Cabinet Saloon next-door, and re-opened in 1901 under the name The Palace Hotel. After its re-opening was called \\"the most beautiful saloon in all of Arizona\\". It was now a two-story masonry building, consisting of grey granite, iron and pressed ornamental bricks, and measuring 75 feet wide and 125 feet front to back. The central pediment on the front fa√ßade contained the seal of the Arizona Territory, flanked by a mountain lion and a bear. In addition to the bar, the saloon also contained gaming tables for faro, poker, roulette, kino and craps. During the Prohibition era, while the saloon closed down, a speakeasy continued to operate in the basement. Throughout its history it has served as more than just a bar and restaurant, being used as a place to post work notices, the local mineral office where mineral claims were bought and sold, and as a polling location during elections. It also had a seedier side, its upstairs rooms being used as a brothel, its basement used as an opium den, underground jail, and gambling rooms. Holliday's common-law wife, Mary Katherine Horony-Cummings, better known as Big Nose Kate, worked upstairs as a prostitute. In 1996, the saloon underwent a retrograde renovation, restoring the interior to better reflect the time frame in which it was created, including swinging doors, hardwood floors, oak wainscoting and leaded-glass windows. In 2011, Prescott implemented a \\"Boot Drop\\" on New Year's Eve, in imitation of the \\"Ball Drop\\" in New York City's Times Square. Each year the boot is dropped on the roof of The Palace. Current setting Window sign It is located in the historic district of Prescott, across the street from the county courthouse. Having been established in 1877, the establishment is not only the oldest bar in the state of Arizona, but the oldest business as well. It has been named \\"America's 10 best historic saloons\\" by USA Today, the second smallest city in the United States to be able to claim such a distinction. The centerpiece of the saloon is the Brunswick bar which was saved from destruction in the fire of 1900. Built in New Jersey, the bar was freighted around the tip of South America to San Francisco, from where it was transported by pack mule to Prescott, then the territorial capital of Arizona. The bar is 24 feet long, hand-carved from solid oak, and also contains large columns. The bar-top is polished cherry, while its fixtures consist of \\"the finest French plate glass oval top mirrors.\\" In addition to the swinging doors, hardwood floors, oak wainscoting and leaded-glass windows, the walls are lined with historic photographs and taxidermy. The bar taps are in unusual shapes such as a pistol and a cowboy, there is a high, pressed-tin ceiling, and the booths are named after famous patrons such as the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday. The wait staff and bartenders dress in period costumes from the 1880s. According to historians and anthropologists, the 1996 restoration returned the saloon to \\"an accurate replica of the original bar as it was constructed in 1877.\\" The bar continues to sell Old Overholt, which was the preferred drink of Holliday when he frequented the saloon. In the back of the saloon is a hand-painted mural featuring scenes and actors from Junior Bonner. In popular culture The bar has been featured in several films, including Junior Bonner, starring Steve McQueen; Billy Jack, starring Tom Laughlin; and Wanda Nevada, starring Peter Fonda and Brooke Shields. The establishment is said to be haunted by several of its past denizens, and has been featured on Ghost Adventures.

It was originally staged at the Bush Theatre in 1975 and directed by Hugh Thomas. City Sugar‚Äôs cast was led by John Shrapnel as Leonard Brazil and supported by Leon Vitali and Lynne Miller. In 1976 the play then transferred to the Comedy Theatre with Adam Faith taking over as Leonard Brazil and James Aubrey as Rex. City Sugar, along with its companion piece Hitting Town, won Poliakoff the Evening Standard's Most Promising Playwright Award in 1976. The play was widely performed in regional cities all over Britain, and was presented at the Phoenix Theatre in New York City with Jeff Goldblum in the lead role and was made into a successful ITV television play with Tim Curry playing the lead. City Sugar followed the story of the young waitress, Nicola, whom the audience first encountered in Poliakoff‚Äôs Hitting Town.  Storyline  The story charts a week in the life of a DJ, Leonard Brazil, as he launches what he calls the competition of the century aimed directly at a youth audience. It is a promotional campaign designed to whip up excitement amongst the station's audience in preparation for a super-group's visit to the city. As Leonard runs the competition, he is tormented by self-loathing and takes out his anger on those around him. He singles out Nicola Davies, one of his listeners and engineers, and she came into the studio where he purposefully humiliated her.

The route formed by the two railways was sometimes referred to as the Wyre Forest line or simply the Tenbury Line. The Tenbury Railway never achieved great commercial success, and the decline in dependence on railways for local transport in the 1950s resulted in a steep fall-off in use of the line. The line closed completely in 1961, except that Tenbury station was served by a school passenger service from the Bewdley direction for a year, then closing; a goods service from Bewdley to Tenbury closed in 1964, and the former railway had no further railway activity.

William Norris was a local man and his energies were directed at this stage into getting a branch line to Tenbury built. A Parliamentary Bill for a branch line from Woofferton to Tenbury went to the 1859 session. Notwithstanding some discussion about whether an extension to Bewdley was immediately desirable, the Tenbury Railway Act obtained the Royal Assent on 21 July 1859.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 558 Authorised capital was ¬£30,000, of which the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway might subscribe ¬£5,000.Beddoes and Smith, pages 12 and 13Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, page 305 The S&HR; assisted by selling lands, including the defunct Leominster Canal, and much of the Tenbury Railway route used some of the alignment of the canal.Rex Christiansen, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 13: Thames and Severn, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1981, , page 113 During the construction period, further negotiations with the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway took place, resulting in the larger company agreeing to work the line for ¬£500 per annum plus 40% of the balance of receipts.Beddoes and Smith, page 14 Construction and opening A GWR diesel railcar at Tenbury Wells StationThe line did not take long to construct, and Colonel Yolland of the Board of Trade inspected the line on 27 July 1861 with a view to authorising passenger traffic. He approved the opening, but required a full double junction to be provided at Woofferton: only the southbound line was connected; and the signals there were inadequate. The railway opened on 1 August 1861; there were five trains each way daily; the railway contractor Thomas Brassey worked the line, as he was working the S&HR; main line at the time.

The town of Tenbury is on the south side of the River Teme, which is spanned by an ornate road bridge.Rex Christiansen, Forgotten Railways: volume 11: Severn Valley and Welsh Borders, David St Jiohn Thomas, Newton Abbot, 1988, , page 86 The county boundary is in the centre of the river, and whilst Tenbury Wells is in Worcestershire, the railway station was in Shropshire. Tenbury and Bewdley Railway Tenbury Wells railway stationWhen the Tenbury line was under construction, there was already enthusiasm to extend the line to Bewdley. The Tenbury and Bewdley Railway obtained the Royal Assent on 3 July 1860; it was to run from Tenbury to the Severn Valley Railway at Bewdley.Beddoes and Smith, page 16 Amalgamations From 1 July 1862 the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway was leased jointly, 50% by the London and North Western Railway and 50% by the Great Western Railway and the West Midland Railway together. The following year the GWR and the West Midland themselves amalgamated, so that the main line at Woofferton was joint between the GWR and the LNWR. The Tenbury Railway was transferred to joint line status, so that from 1 July 1862 it was leased to the two other companies jointly. Thomas Brassey handed over the working of the line to the LNWR, who worked the line on behalf of the joint lessees.Beddoes and Smith, page 23 Opening of the Bewdley line The Tenbury and Bewdley Railway opened fully on 13 August 1864. It used the Tenbury Railway station at Tenbury, where it formed an end-on junction.Beddoes and Smith, page 32 Absorbed by the LNWR and GWR From 1 January 1869, the Tenbury Railway was acquired by the LNWR and GWR jointly, by Act of 1 December 1868.Grant says this was on 1 July 1871.Beddoes and Smith, page 38 Bewdley loop The railway network at Bewdley connected southwards towards Droitwich Spa, but the Bewdley Curve or Bewdley Loop, giving direct running north-east towards Kidderminster, opened on 1 June 1878.Beddoes and Smith, page 43 Train service The passenger train service indicated in the Bradshaw's Guide varied little over the years. In 1895 there were four trains daily (not Sundays) between Bewdley and Woofferton, with an additional two on the Tenbury to Woofferton section. By 1910 this had changed to five and four respectively, remaining similar from 1922 to 1960.Bradshaw's Rail Times for Great Britain and Ireland: December 1895, reprint, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2018, Bradshaw's April 1910 Railway Guide, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1968, Bradshaw's 1922 Railway Guide, Guild Publishing London, 1985Bradshaw's July 1938 Railway Guide, David & Charles Reprints, Newton Abbot, 1969, Western Region of British Railways, Passenger Timetable, Summer 1960 Railway organisation At the beginning of 1923 most of the railways of Great Britain were grouped, by Government order, into one or other of four new railways; the process is referred to as the \\"grouping\\", following the Railways Act 1921. The Great Western Railway amalgamated with other lines but retained its identity; the LNWR was a constituent of a new company, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. From 1 March 1932 the Shrewsbury office of the GWR had taken over the routine management of the S&HR; line and the Tenbury branch. At nationalisation in 1948, the Tenbury line was allocated jointly to the London Midland Region of British Railways, as successor to the LMS, and the Western Region as successor to the GWR. Joint status in common ownership proved to be of doubtful value, and in September 1948 that situation was rationalised and the whole line came under the control of the Western Region.Beddoes and Smith, pages 140 and 141 Decline The rural nature of the area served by the line meant that as soon as reliable road transport for goods and passengers became available, use of the railway declined. The decline was steep and after nationalisation it was plain that the losses were unsustainable. The former Tenbury Railway line was to be completely closed, except that a basic residual train service from Kidderminster would continue to run to and from Tenbury Wells station, so that the station continued in basic use. One passenger train ran in each direction, chiefly in connection with school pupils' journeys, was to operate for a year from 31 July 1961 on an experimental basis.Beddoes and Smith, page 190 The experiment was not thought to be successful, and passenger operation, and use of the Tenbury Wells station, ceased on 1 August 1962. A very basic goods service continued to Tenbury,Beddoes and Smith, page 193 but this too was withdrawn on 6 January 1964, and all railway activity on the former Tenbury Railway ceased.Beddoes and Smith, page 195 and 196 Station list * Woofferton; on S&HR; main line; opened 6 December 1853; closed 31 July 1961; * Easton Court; opened 1 August 1861; closed 31 July 1961; * Tenbury; opened 1 August 1861; renamed Tenbury Wells 1912; closed 31 July 1961.Christiansen says \\"The GWR called it simply Tenbury in public timetables, but Tenbury Wells (which was also the LNWR designation) in working timetables.\\"Forgotten Railways, page 78Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain: A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Limited, Shepperton, 2002R A Cooke, Atlas of the Great Western Railway as at 1947, Wild Swan Publications, Didcot, 1997, Michael Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology, the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, 2002 Notes References Rail transport in Shropshire Closed railway lines in the West Midlands (region) ","title":"Tenbury Railway"},{"id":"52859048","text":"Tsui Ting Or (born 13 June 1993), known professionally as Poon Choi Ying Chi, is a Hong Kong singer and comedian.

During a routine dive in the East Shetland Basin of the North Sea, the diving bell of the diving support vessel MS Wildrake became separated from its main lift wire at a depth of over . Although the bell was eventually recovered by Wildrake, its two occupants, 32-year-old Richard Arthur Walker and 28-year-old Victor Francis \\"Skip\\" Guiel Jr., died of hypothermia. The accident resulted in extensive subsequent litigation and led to important safety changes in the diving industry. MS Wildrake in Bj√∏rnafjorden, July 1979, shortly before the accident. The yellow- tipped SALM is moored to the side of the ship. Photo by Marcus Taylor Ltd.  Background  In March 1977, a Single Anchor Leg Mooring (SALM) system was installed in the Thistle oil field as a loading facility for oil tankers. It consisted of a buoy and riser connected to a gravity base on the seafloor. By January 1979, the buoy had become partially disconnected from the riser. British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) had the buoy blown free of the riser with explosives and taken to Amsterdam for repairs, but the explosive charges damaged the riser. In April 1979 the riser was removed from the base by divers and taken to Bergen, Norway to be repaired. In early 1978, Brian Masterson, an English businessman and engineer, co-founded Infabco Diving Services Ltd., a commercial diving company. BNOC awarded Infabco a contract for diving services from the drill rig Gulnare alongside the Thistle Alpha platform. Investigative reporter Bryan Gould would later discover that BNOC's Offshore Construction Manager, Joe Singletary, facilitated Infabco's bid by allowing Masterson to examine his competitors' bids. After the Wildrake accident, BNOC's security division and Grampian Police investigated the possibility that Masterson had bribed BNOC officials for contracts. On 18 June 1979, BNOC contracted with Infabco to reinstall the SALM on its base in the Thistle field. The MS Wildrake was a diving support vessel constructed for and owned by Anders Wilhelmsen AS, a Norwegian shipping company. It had a built-in saturation diving system designed and built by another Norwegian company, M√∏llerodden AS. In May 1979, Infabco began negotiations for exclusive rights to the Wildrake. In June and early July, with the Wildrake moored near Ulsteinvik, Infabco personnel prepared its diving system for use. The system was certified by Det Norske Veritas (DNV) on 3 July 1979. In mid-July, 17 bell runs were conducted from the Wildrake to prepare the SALM base for the reattachment. Typical bell with stage and conventional clump weight system During this period, several significant alterations were made to the diving system. The swivel connecting the lift wire to the bell was replaced with a pair of shackles. The clump weight below the bell, which served as a backup recovery system, was removed to enable the bell to be launched over the side of the Wildrake rather than through the ship's moon pool. The bell's drop weights, another secondary means of bell recovery, were lashed to the bell frame with nylon rope to prevent their accidental release. The accidental release of drop weights had caused fatal diving bell accidents in the North Sea in 1974 and 1976. The Wildrake bell also had no bell stage to keep the bottom hatch out of the mud if the bell became stranded on the sea bottom.  Accident  In late July and early August 1979, Wildrake divers reattached the SALM buoy to the riser and prepared the SALM for transport from Bj√∏rnafjorden to Thistle field. On the night of 7 August 1979, Richard Walker and Victor Guiel, who had been in saturation since 29 July, were lowered to a depth of in the Wildrake diving bell to work on the reattachment of the SALM to its base. This was Bell Dive No. 30 from the Wildrake. As the bell was lowered into the ocean, its transponder came loose, and the Wildrake deck foreman was ordered to cut it off. Shortly after 0220 hours on the morning of 8 August, Walker, who had been working outside the bell on the SALM base, saw that the bell had become separated from its lift wire and was hanging at an angle by its life support umbilical. He reported the emergency and rejoined Guiel in the bell, where the two divers closed and sealed the inside door. The bottom door, which opened outward, was left open and secured back to the bell frame. Wildrake dive superintendent Peter Holmes and dive supervisor Brian Reid believed that the umbilical was the correct secondary means of bell recovery in the system M√∏llerodden AS had designed. M√∏llerodden later denied this, and DNV had not certified the umbilical winch for bell recovery. Reid attempted to raise the bell with the umbilical, which was already damaged. The umbilical wheel on the ship's davit consisted of a rubber tire between two circular metal plates. The umbilical became jammed between the tire and one of the side plates. A further attempt to raise the bell on the umbilical using the ship's crane damaged the umbilical even more severely, and power and hot water to the bell were cut off. In response to a faint radio transmission from Walker and Guiel, the Wildrake crew lowered the bell to the seabed at a depth of .  Rescue attempts  Norwegian decorative plate depicting the Wildrake in May 1979. The diving vessel Stena Welder came alongside the Wildrake to render assistance in the rescue, but its diving system was undergoing repairs and had to be hastily readied for diving. Rather than having the Stena Welder recover the bell with its own crane, Holmes and Brian Masterson elected to raise the bell with the Wildrakes crane. This necessitated that the Stena Welder rescue divers attach a guide wire to the bell, which would then be used to send the Wildrake crane hook to the bell, allowing the rescue diver to attach it to the bell with a wire sling. At 0609 hours, the Stena Welder diving bell entered the water carrying rescue divers Phil Kasey-Smith and Eddy Frank. Due to communication problems, failure of the lights on the Stena Welder bell, the absence of the Wildrake bell's transponder, and the fact that the Wildrake crew had forgotten they had moved the bell away from the SALM base a few hours earlier, it took Kasey-Smith nearly an hour to find the Wildrake bell on the seafloor. At 0755 hours, he saw Walker and Guiel giving him thumbs up through the porthole. Kasey-Smith spent another hour directing the recovery of the slack guide wire around the SALM base. Because the Stena Welder was not a dynamic positioning (DP) vessel, it could not be held in a constant position, causing the Stena Welder bell to drag Kasey-Smith around the seabed on his umbilical. At 0902 hours, Kasey-Smith attached the guide wire to the bell. The Wildrake began lowering its crane hook, but Kasey-Smith now saw that Walker and Guiel's movements had become \\"very very frantic\\". The crane hook came down too far from the bell for Kasey-Smith to reach it with the wire slings attached to the hook. The hook was raised, had further slings attached, and was sent down again to Kasey-Smith, who attached the slings to the Wildrake bell at 1010 hours. The Wildrake attempted to lift the bell from the bottom at a 45-degree angle rather than vertically, and without a visual confirmation that the bell was clear to be lifted. During the lift, the bell wedged against the side of the SALM base, causing the wire sling to break. The end of the crane wire emerged from the sea at 1220 hours without the Wildrake bell, which was again lost. When rescue diver Frank relocated the bell, he saw that Walker or Guiel had attempted to cut the ropes on the drop weights to allow the bell to surface, but that only one of the two weights was cut free. He also saw that the stranded divers were near death. With Kasey-Smith and Frank at the point of exhaustion, they were brought to the surface in the Stena Welder bell and relieved by divers Michael Mangan and Tony Slayman. At 1816 hours, Mangan reconnected the crane wire to the bell. At 1937 hours, the bell was lifted out of the ocean. It was docked to the Wildrake saturation system, where Dr. Morven White, who had been placed into saturation, examined Walker and Guiel and determined that they were dead. The official pronouncement of death was made by Dr. George Shirrifs, who had arrived aboard the Wildrake with White earlier that day. The divers' autopsies in Aberdeen, Scotland, determined that they died of hypothermia.  Aftermath  The Felinto Perry, formerly the Wildrake, in 2015. On 9 August 1979, Department of Energy (DoE) inspectors and police boarded the Wildrake to investigate the accident. DoE inspector Roy Giles found multiple safety violations and evidence of negligence. Richard Walker's widow and Victor Guiel's family retained San Francisco attorney Gerald Sterns, who filed a wrongful death complaint in the United States on 30 July 1980 against ten defendants, including Infabco Diving Services and M√∏llerodden AS. On 28 November 1980, Infabco Diving Services Ltd. was indicted on criminal charges in Aberdeen Sheriff Court as the employer of Walker and Guiel. At the criminal trial, which began on 15 December 1980, the diving company used what later became known as the \\"Infabco defense\\", claiming that the divers were actually employed by a company called Offshore Co-ordinators Ltd., which was located in a bank on Jersey and registered in the Isle of Man. On 19 December 1980, Sheriff Alastair Stewart ruled that the Crown had failed to prove that Infabco was Walker and Guiel's employer. He therefore directed the jury to find Infabco not guilty. In May 1981, the United States District Court in Los Angeles awarded compensatory damages of $475,000 to Walker's widow and daughter and $75,000 to Guiel's family. This judgement, however, would never be enforced by the British court system. A fatal accident inquiry on Walker and Guiel's deaths was held from 11 to 22 May 1981 in Aberdeen. At the inquiry, Walker's widow, Jeanne Walker, read aloud the final entry from her husband's diary, written on 7 August 1979, in which he commented, \\"I don't even know if I'm gonna get out of here alive.\\" Sheriff Douglas James Risk issued his Determinations on 13 November 1981. He found that the removal of the clump weight contributed to the divers' deaths and that the absence of a bell stage indicated \\"that the diving contractors were more concerned with speed than with safety\\". He also concluded that Walker and Guiel \\"could probably have been saved\\" if Masterson had not ordered the crane lift to continue without investigating the obstruction impeding the lift, which proved to be the SALM base. On 17 December 1981, the Thames Television current affairs series TV Eye broadcast The Last Dive, a documentary featuring investigative reporter and former Member of Parliament Bryan Gould, which alleged that an improper relationship existed between Brian Masterson and Joe Singletary, BNOC's Offshore Construction Manager at the time of the accident. On 23 July 1982, the Edinburgh law firm of Simpson and Marwick filed suit in the United Kingdom against twelve defendants on behalf of the Walker and Guiel families. In October 1986, the remaining defendants settled, agreeing to pay ¬£293,000 ($422,066.50) to the Walkers and a much smaller amount (possibly around $8000) to the Guiels. No admission of wrongdoing was ever made by the defendants. The Wildrake, renamed Felinto Perry, later became a submarine rescue ship in the Brazilian Navy. In May 2000, the Wildrake accident records in London were found to be missing.

It is part of the Hospital Sisters Health System. History St. Vincent Hospital was created in 1888 by the Third Order of Saint Francis. The first hospital was in a home on Quincy Street in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and consisted of just one chair, four beds, and a kettle for laundry. In 1894, the hospital purchased eight lots on Webster Avenue, and the next year a new hospital building was built at this location. In 1957, a large, modern addition opened, enlarging the hospital to 437 beds. In 1998, the hospital partnered with Bellin Health and County Rescue Services to construct a helipad and purchase a rescue helicopter named EAGLE III. In 2015, the hospital upgraded their pediatric unit into a new St. Vincent Children's Hospital, and became a member of the Children's Hospital Association. In 2016, St. Vincent became the first hospital in Wisconsin to begin offering a Bioresorbable stent. Medical operations St. Vincent Hospital partners with Prevea Health, which is also owned by Hospital Sisters Health System, to provide health clinics throughout northeast Wisconsin.

He is the founder of Golden Pages Israel, Amdocs, the Aurec Group, Coral World and other companies. Through Coral World he founded several marine parks around the world, including the underwater observatory in Eilat. He is active in philanthropy and venture philanthropy. Early life Morris Kahn was born in March 1930 in Benoni, South Africa, to a Jewish family. He is the eldest child of Philip and Beattie Kahn. He was an active member of the Zionist youth group, Habonim. In 1956, Kahn moved from South Africa to Israel with his wife, Jacqueline Maloon, and their two sons, Benjamin and David.http://www.sajr.co.za/docs/default- source/pdf/2009/10-july-2009.pdf?sfvrsn=2 Business ventures Kahn‚Äôs business career in Israel began with a few business ventures, including a bicycle factory in Beit Shemesh in partnership with Kibbutz Tzora; and a cattle company in the Northern Galilee. In 1978 Kahn and Shmuel Meitar founded the Aurec Group, an Israeli-based private equity firm which started with investments in the cable and telecom sectors. This led to the installation of a fiber optic cable from Israel to Italy, which connected Israel to the rest of the world. His first major success began with the establishment of the Golden Pages telephone directory in Israel in 1968, which led to the co- founding of Amdocs in 1982, together with Shmuel and Tzvi Meitar. Amdocs provides customer relationship management and billing software for big telecommunications firms. The company, which is traded on NASDAQ (revenue in fiscal 2015: $3.6 billion) currently serves more than 300 clients in more than 90 countries, and has about 26,000 employees. Aurec also owns Golden Channels, Israel's first cable company, founded in 1989 and Golden Lines, Israel's first international communications company, founded in 1996. In 1997 the Aurec Group acquired 50% of Netcom, the launch of AIG Golden Insurance and Alpha Visa- Card. He is a principal investor in Aurum Ventures and the clean tech water company Atlantium, that uses UV rays to disinfect water, and N-Trig, a manufacturer of multi-touch screens for computers. In 2016 Aurum Ventures invested $3 million in a new method of diagnosing cancer developed by Noklaiks (Nucleix) Israel. Time to Know is a digital education platform which Kahn first launched as a nonprofit organization focused on improving grade school education. Kahn, a former diver, founded Coral World International, a group of aquariums around the world in Eilat, Israel; Maui, Hawaii; Perth, Australia; St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands; Coral Island Nassau, The Bahamas; Oceanworld in Manly, Australia; and elsewhere.  Philanthropy  Kahn supports the work of Save a Child's Heart (SACH), an organization that brings israeli doctors around the world to perform life-saving surgery and medical monitoring for children of all races, religions, nationalities, and economic status. The Morris Kahn Initiative is a $4 million program to help develop pioneering cancer research at Tel Aviv University. The initiative‚Äôs aim is to develop 3D cancer modeling of live cancer tumors. ‚ÄúBig Data Maccabi,‚Äù founded with contributions from Kahn, will help medical professionals to diagnose illness using the information collected during blood tests, imaging and other diagnostic testing. He supports Serious Fun, a camp for children with terminal illness, and a therapeutic horse-riding camp for the disabled. Kahn founded Zalul in 1999, a non-profit foundation which cleans bodies of water in Israel. Founded by Morris Kahn, SpaceIL is the first to sign a launch agreement for a private moon mission on the SpaceX Falcon 9 Launcher. SpaceIL hoped to land an Israeli spacecraft on the moon in either 2017 or 2018, but delays arose, and it was targeted for 11 April 2019. The attempt was unsuccessful, the engine cut out at around 10 km height and the spacecraft crashed into the Moon. Still the mission was seen as a success. He started the Youth Leadership Program called LEAD, dedicated to developing the next generation of leaders. Kahn is a supporter of Ben-Gurion University and the National Institute for Biotechnology of the Negev. The Morris Kahn Institute for Human Immunology was funded by Kahn. In conjunction with the Weizman Institute, he founded the Kahn Family Research Center for Systems Biology of the Human Cell. Kahn supports the Morris Kahn and Maccabi Health Data Science Institute, to create a database for the 2.5 million members of the Maccabi Healthcare Services organization. He sponsors an Omo Valley and Jinka, Ethiopia-based project, Jinka Eye Camp, for volunteer Israeli surgeons to perform operations to restore eyesight to people living in rural villages suffering from eye diseases such as cataracts and trachoma.

Biography He had his primary education in Pezinok then, in 1924, attended the secondary school in Ko≈°ice, where he studied economics. After deciding on art as a career, he went to Bratislava to take private lessons from the Expressionist painter . After acquiring the basics, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, where he studied under and Jakub Obrovsk√Ω.Brief biography @ Slovensk√© Dotyky. Upon graduation, he settled in Prague. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza In 1932, he took a brief trip to Paris, where he came under the influence of Marc Chagall and Giorgio de Chirico. In Prague, he became part of a circle of painters that included , and . Although he centered his career there, he made numerous trips to Slovakia to visit his family and hold exhibitions. About this time, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Nevertheless, his work was energized by his opposition to Fascism. By 1942, this was virtually his only theme, as he protested the prison camps, death marches and other evils perpetrated by the Nazi r√©gime. The figure of Don Quixote was a recurring motif of continued resistance, despite overwhelming odds against success. Following the Soviet liberation of Prague in May, 1945, the Umƒõleck√° beseda (an artists' association) gave him a certificate of political reliability. At that time, he also married his long-time companion, Karla, and applied for an apartment permit. Not long after, he committed suicide by jumping from a window. It is unknown what the immediate cause may have been, but he had recently suffered from short bouts of depression, related to the increasing difficulty involved in holding and manipulating brushes. A major retrospective was held the following year. In 1991, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk by President Vaclav Havel. A showing in honor of his 100th birthday was presented at Mirbach Palace in 2009.

It is a standard simplification and assumption used in probability theory. Generally, it is used in the context of measure theory on n-dimensional Euclidean space, for which it can be intuitive to study measures that are unchanged by rotations and translations. An obvious example of such a measure is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space: Lebesgue measure.  Definition  An isotropic measure on \\\\mathbb{R}^{d} is a (Borel) measure that is absolutely continuous on \\\\mathbb {R}^d \\\\smallsetminus \\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\\\\\} and that is invariant under linear isometries of \\\\mathbb{R}^{d}. Alternatively, an isotropic measure, \\\\mu(dz), is a measure for which there exists a real density function \\\\mu_{0}(r) on (0,\\\\infty) such that \\\\mu(dz) = \\\\mu_{0}\\\\left( z \\\\right)dz for z eq 0.  Example  * The Lebesgue measure on \\\\mathbb{R}^{d} is invariant under linear isometries and is hence an isotropic measure. In this case, \\\\mu(dz) = dz. * For d=1, the linear isometries of \\\\mathbb{R}^{1} are of the form f(x) = x + c or f(x) = -x + c, for some constant c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. Hence an isotropic measure on \\\\mathbb{R}^{1} must satisfy \\\\mu(A) = \\\\mu(-A + b), for any A \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{1} and b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. The measure \\\\mu(dz) = z^{-2} dz, for z eq 0, is one such isotropic measure.  Unimodal measure  In probability theory it is common that another assumption is added to measures in addition to the measure being isotropic. A unimodal measure (or isotropic unimodal measure) is any isotropic measure \\\\mu(dz) = \\\\mu_{0}\\\\left( z \\\\right)dz such that \\\\mu_{0}(r) is nonincreasing on (0,\\\\infty). It is possible that \\\\mu\\\\left( \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\right)>0.  Isotropic and unimodal stochastic processes  In studying stochastic processes, in particular L√©vy processes, a reasonable assumption to make is that, for each element of the index set, the probability distributions of the random variables are isotropic or even unimodal measures. More specifically, an isotropic L√©vy process is a L√©vy process, X = \\\\left( X_t, t \\\\geq 0 \\\\right), such that all its distributions, p_{t} (dx), are isotropic measures. A unimodal L√©vy process (or isotropic unimodal L√©vy process) is a L√©vy process, X = \\\\left( X_t, t \\\\geq 0 \\\\right), such that all its distributions, p_{t} (dx), are unimodal measures.

It is chosen to be on Friday the 13th each year and because there is a least one Friday the 13th per year on the modern Gregorian calendar, this is always possible. The event-day was started in 1995. In 2013, NAD was on September 13, and at that time Finland was experiencing about one million reported accidents, resulting in 2,800 deaths. Accident day is not limited to automotive accidents however, it is also to bring awareness to increasing safety in workplaces. Another place for increased safety awareness is in the home. The day is promoted by the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, which works also works other government and non-government agencies for this event. In 2016 Finland's National Accident Day occurred on May 13. The theme for that year was \\"accidents caused by haste\\" and there were increased traffic patrols in the weeks prior to the special day. One of the ongoing concerns is the hundreds of pedestrians, cyclists, and moped riders that are injured on the nation's roads.

There are minor discrepancies, with both of these rejecting an engraving of Venus and Cupid. He appears to have come from northern Italy, but later worked in Rome.Zucker, 74‚Äì75 He specialized in subjects from classical mythology,Oberhuber, 442 as well as the inevitable religious subjects. Despite his relatively small output, he was a sophisticated artist, whose style shows a number of influences and changes, reflecting awareness of the currents in artistic style at the start of the High Renaissance.Hind (1935), 440; Zucker, 75 The signed prints are usually dated to around 1500‚Äì1511.Oberhuber, 445; Zucker, 75; BM says \\"1500‚Äì1520\\" in the biographical details, but 1500‚Äì1510 or ‚àí1515 for individual prints. His earlier name comes from the monogram with which most of his prints are signed, the initials IB followed by a small image of a pigeon-like bird. The Italian word palumbo means 'pigeon' (the Latin name of the common wood pigeon is Columba palumbus), and in Latin the initial for Giovanni ('John' in English) is I, for Iohannes.Oberhuber, 440; Landau, 102 He is not to be confused with the Master I.B., a German printmaker active in Nuremberg c. 1523‚Äì1530. Atalanta and Meleager hunting the Calydonian boar, woodcut, Palumba's largest (270 √ó 445 mm) and perhaps most accomplished print.McDonald, 112 He is also attributed with various woodcuts for book illustrations from both before and after the 1500s, though all of these are rejected by some, and he is generally accepted as the author of a drawing in the British Museum related to his print of Leda and the Swan, with their Children.  Identification and known biographical facts  Master I.B. with a Bird had long been known, and is catalogued by Bartsch. In the 18th century the famous print collector Pierre-Jean Mariette had already proposed that the monogram hid a name with an avian meaning such as \\"Joannes Baptista Palumbus\\",Oberhuber, 440 and in 1923 Arthur Mayger Hind speculated: \\"One thinks of Passeri [sparrow] or Uccello [bird] as possible surnames\\".Hind (1923) In the 19th century an artist from Modena called Giovanni Battista del Porto was believed by many to be Master I.B. with a Bird. In the 1930s James Byam Shaw, who published on the prints, thought he might be Jacopo Ripanda, known as a painter and designer of antiquarian prints from Bologna, who mixed in the Roman humanist milieu that the prints reflect; ripanda is an Italian term for a water-bird.Oberhuber, 441; BM; Landau, 100; Hind (1935), 439‚Äì440; Zucker, 74 ; Examples of the monogram File:Palumba lotis (cropped).jpgPriapus and Lotis, see below File:Palumba europa2 (cropped to monogram).jpgRape of Europa, see below File:Palumba roma (cropped to monogram).jpgPersonification of Roma, see below File:Palumba ledafamily (cropped to monogram).jpgLeda and the Swan, with their Children, see below A satyress and her children, engraving The question was settled in 1936 when Augusto Campana published a gloss in a manuscript of poetry by Evangelista Maddeleni dei Cappodiferro in the Vatican Library which identified Palumba by referring to his print of Leda and the Swan, and this identification is now universally accepted.Oberhuber, 440‚Äì441 ‚Äì The manuscript gave various characters nicknames, the actual names being given in notes in the margins. There was an epigram \\"Of Leda printed by Dares\\", with Palumba named in the margin; BM Campana dated the epigram on the Leda to 1503, based on the sequence in the manuscript, but Konrad Oberhuber argues for a date around 1508‚Äì10, based on the style of the print itself, and its closeness to datable prints of that period by Marcantonio Raimondi.Oberhuber, 441 Identifying Master I.B. with a Bird with Palumba brought almost no extra biographical information, as there are no other documentary records with the name.Zucker, 74 The same Vatican manuscript credits Palumba with a painted portrait of a Sicilian servant, perhaps of Cardinal Giovanni Colonna (1456‚Äì1508). A Pietro Paolo Palumba, who published prints in Rome dated between 1559 and 1584, describes himself as \\"Palumbus successor Palumbi\\".Oberhuber, 440 Extrapolating from the stylistic influences visible in the prints, he is believed to have had a background in or close to Milan or Bologna, with some claiming unsigned woodcut book illustrations published there or in Saluzzo between 1490 and 1503 are by him.Oberhuber, 440‚Äì443 Hind thought that one early engraving \\"with its niello-like background, suggests a goldsmith's education,\\" and that \\"it seems rash to dogmatize on the locality of so eclectic a spirit\\"Hind, 1923, 60; the print Goldsmithing was a common background for engravers as the technique was first used on metalwork, and formed part of their normal training. This early period was followed by a move to Rome by about 1503; one print shows some \\"freaks of nature\\" that were news there in 1503.Oberhuber, 440 The dates estimated for his independent prints finish around 1510,Oberhuber, 452 though the portraits in Illustrium Imagines would have been from some years later, if they are his. Personification of Rome, engraving Palumba has also been suggested as the author of the long series of imagined profile head portraits of famous people in Andrea Fulvio's Illustrium Imagines (1517), though this idea has been rejected by other writers.\\"There is not a single bit of written or printed source material that links Giovanni Battista Palumba to the portraits in Andrea Fulvio's Illustrium Imagines. The question remains with us as to how an art historian can link the aerated style of Palumba in the larger pictures with the dense black and white sketchy portraits in the Illustrium Imagines...\\", Spink Numismatic Circular, Volume 108, 2000 He was proposed by Campana as the author of other woodcut book illustrations published in Venice and Siena between 1521 and 1524, though A.M. Hind disagreed. Oberhuber concludes that \\"It seems to be clear, at least, that after about 1510‚Äì11 Palumba's production of single woodcuts and engravings ceases\\".Oberhuber, 445 A drawing in the British Museum of Leda and the Swan, with their Children had been attributed to Giorgione, Sodoma, and \\"Anonymous: Milanese School\\", before Hind's attribution to Palumba was generally accepted. The composition is very similar to the engraving of the same subject (in reverse), as are the style and mood, though the background and minor details in the poses of the figures are different.Oberhuber, 450‚Äì453; Zucker, 75; British Museum, the drawing  Prints and style  Engravers generally worked the plates for their designs at this period, and it is assumed Palumba did the same. Conversely, like many or most designers of woodcuts, he probably did not cut the blocks himself; some of his woodcuts have other initials, presumably those of specialist block- cutters.Hind (1935), 442 He seems to have practised both techniques throughout the period of the prints with monograms.Oberhuber, 443‚Äì445 There is a single late chiaroscuro woodcut of Saint Sebastian, with one line and one tone block; this is very early for Italy, and a \\"truly pictorial\\" print.Oberhuber, 444, quoted; Hind (1935), 442; Landau, 150‚Äì153 Many of the prints taken to be relatively early show clear debts, especially in the landscape backgrounds, to the prints of Albrecht D√ºrer, especially those from the last five years of the 15th century; these were widely circulated in north Italy and had a strong and immediate influence on many printmakers.Oberhuber, 441‚Äì442, 446; Hind (1935), 440; McDonald, 110; Zucker, 75 The religious subjects are mostly regarded as early, a woodcut of the Crucifixion having many similarities to Andrea Solari's painting (now Louvre) made in Milan in 1503.Oberhuber, 442; Hind (1935), 443; the painting Apart from D√ºrer, who is invariably the first named, many other artists are mentioned as influences: Andrea Mantegna, Nicoletto da Modena, the Bolognese school in general, Sodoma, Baldassare Peruzzi, Francesco Francia,Hind (1923), 60; Hind (1935), 440 Marcantonio Raimondi, Andrea Solario, Venetian sculpture, Cesare da Sesto, Pollaiuolo, Cristofano Robetta, Filippino Lippi, Pinturicchio, Jacopo Ripanda, and Luca Signorelli.Oberhuber, 441‚Äì442 Oberhuber echoes Hind in calling him \\"extremely eclectic, but he always appropriates his motifs in such a way that the sources are not easy to identify\\".Oberhuber, 442 His borrowings from Leonardo are discussed below. In turn Leo Steinberg gives the Family of Fauns as the earliest appearance of the \\"slung leg\\" motif \\"in its canonic form\\"; he traces this motif, representing sexual intimacy, to the later works of Raphael and Michelangelo.Steinberg, Leo. ‚ÄúMichelangelo's Florentine Piet√†: The Missing Leg.‚Äù The Art Bulletin, vol. 50, no. 4, 1968, (pp. 343‚Äì353) p. 350, JSTOR. A number of the prints follow the fashion for imagining the varieties of humanoids of classical mythology in their family lives, already set by D√ºrer, Jacopo de' Barbari and others. Palumba's prints include families of tritons, fauns, and satyrs, though in most the females and children appear anatomically human. These and other prints \\"reflect the taste for the antique, mixed with a feeling for the bizarre and delicately beautiful\\" of Filippino Lippi, Pinturicchio, Peruzzi and Ripanda.Oberhuber, 442‚Äì443 He is also interested in Ovidian transformations, with two prints of Leda, and others of Europa being carried off, and Actaeon half-transformed. The approximate chronology proposed by Friedrich Lippmann in a paper of 1894 on the woodcuts has remained largely accepted, and Oberhuber is content to add the engravings to it. The prints are divided into chronological stages or groups, A to E.Oberhuber, 443‚Äì445 His woodcuts have been described, by Mark McDonald, as \\"amongst the most important produced in Italy (Rome) during the early years of the sixteenth century\\",McDonald, 110 but most Italian makers of independent prints (as opposed to book illustrations) preferred to use engraving.Antony Griffiths, Prints and Printmaking, p. 20, 1996, British Museum Press, 2nd edn, Exceptions include Titian, who experimented with woodcuts (executed by others, but with his encouragement) in these years. One link between the two artists is the unusual size of their woodcuts. At 270 x 445 mm and carved on a single block, Atalanta and Meleager hunting the Calydonian boar takes the woodcut near the edge of what is technically feasible; most woodcuts this size use multiple blocks. There was a fashion, mostly in Germany, for even larger woodcuts that were conceived as murals, either pasted to walls or mounted on textiles like Chinese paintings.Landau, 150, 231‚Äì237, 300 File:Palumba crux.jpgCrucifixion of Christ, woodcut File:Palumba prudence.jpgPrudence, or Foresight, engraving File:Palumba europa2.jpgRape of Europa, engraving File:Palumba diana.jpgDiana and Actaeon, woodcut File:Palumba fauns.jpgA family of fauns, engraving File:Palumba vulcan.jpgVulcan forging, with Mars, Venus and Cupid, woodcut File:Palumba stseb.jpgMartyrdom of Saint Sebastian, engraving File:Palumba jerome.jpgSaint Jerome, with lion  Leda and Leonardo  Drawing, Leda and the Swan, with their Children, British Museum Leda and the Swan was a subject that fitted Palumba's taste in subjects, and he engraved it twice; it was fashionable in the period, and a number of artists made depictions. The first is grouped in Lippmann's stage D, perhaps from around 1508, and shows the couple making love enthusiastically in a landscape. The second is from stage E, perhaps around 1510, and is one of his last and most highly praised prints. The British Museum drawing clearly relates to the print, and is \\"tentatively attributable to Master I.B.'s own hand\\".Zucker, 74‚Äì75 (75 quoted); Oberhuber, 444 Leda had also been a preoccupation of Leonardo da Vinci, who also worked on \\"a series of themes and variations on the subject of Leda and her children\\",Zucker, 75 centering on two compositions, in the approximate period 1503‚Äì1510; these both featured the children in some versions. Neither survive as paintings by Leonardo, but there are a number of drawings for both by him, and copies in oils, especially of the second composition, where Leda stands.Oberhuber, 450‚Äì451 Neither of Palumba's compositions borrow directly from Leonardo, but the second \\"appropriates the stylistic ideals created by Leonardo\\",Oberhuber, 445 (quoted), 450 and \\"in its final form, represents a harmonious fusion of Leonardo and D√ºrer\\".Zucker, 75 According to Vasari, Leonardo's disciple Cesare da Sesto was in Rome, probably around 1508‚Äì09, which is one possible route for Palumba's apparent awareness of Leonardo's designs.Oberhuber, 450‚Äì451 In the drawing the background is a D√ºrer-esque clump of trees and rocks, but in the print this is replaced by the famous Roman ruin known as the Temple of Minerva Medica, in fact a nymphaeum, given an invented coastal setting.Zucker, 75; Oberhuber, 452 In the print \\"the classically inspired female nude and accompanying putti [the children] arrange themselves into the sort of tightly knit pyramidal configuration universally associated with principles of Italian High Renaissance design\\".Zucker, 75 File:Palumba leda swan.jpgLeda and the Swan, engraving File:Palumba ledafamily.jpgLeda and the Swan, with their Children, engraving File:Study for the Kneeling Leda.jpgLeonardo da Vinci, Study for the Kneeling Leda, drawing File:Palumba lotis.jpgPriapus and Lotis, engraving  Notes   References  * \\"BM\\": British Museum, \\"Giovanni Battista Palumba (Biographical details)\\" *AM Hind (1923), A History of Engraving and Etching, 1923, Houghton Mifflin Co., reprinted Dover Publications, 1963, *AM Hind (1935), An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Volume II, 1935, Houghton Mifflin Co., reprinted Dover Publications 1963, *Landau, David, and Parshall, Peter.

Country According to R. H. Mathews, the Darkinyung's territory encompassed the lands to the south of the Hunter River, from Jerry's Plains towards Maitland, extending as far to the south as Wollombi Brook, Putty Creek, inclusive of the Macdonald, Colo, and Hawkesbury rivers. History of contact with white settlers In 1789, Governor Arthur Phillip conducted a boat expedition upstream to the branches of the Hawkesbury River, encountering the local inhabitants. He returned overland in 1791; members of his party who were natives of the Cumberland Plain confirmed that the people there were of a distinct group that spoke a different language. Phillip wrote: \\"Two of those natives who have lived amongst us for some time were with us, which was from them that we understood, our new friends had a language different from theirs.\\" The British referred to these inhabitants of the upper Hawkesbury, Richmond Hill, Kurrajong and Springwood as \\"The Branch natives\\". Ford writes that, after settlement of the upper Hawkesbury, \\"'The Branch' natives were pacified in 1805 by a massacre led by Andrew Thompson towards Springwood.\\" In 1824, John Blaxland, Jnr, learned that the mountain people south of the Hunter River referred to their land as Wallambine. Later, Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell instructed that a new town in the region be named Wollombi. The term \\"Wollombi Tribe\\" came to be used for that group. By the last years of the 19th century, only a remnant, mostly half-castes, of 60 Darkinyung had survived, concentrated on a government reserve set aside for aborigines on the Hawkesbury river, from Windsor. Of these, only two very old men had been initiated, Hoe Gooburra and Charley Clark. It was thanks to these elderly informants that much of what is known of Darkinung traditional ways was able to be recorded by Mathews.

The Guardian has described the controversial opposition research as \\"one of the most explosive documents in modern political history\\". The dossier, leaked without permission, is an unfinished 35-page compilation of raw intelligence based on information from witting and unwitting anonymous sources known to the author, counterintelligence specialist Christopher Steele, a former head of the Russia Desk for British intelligence (MI6), written for the private investigative firm Fusion GPS. The dossier's 17 unredacted reports allege that Trump campaign members and Russian operatives had conspired to co-operate in Russia's election interference to benefit Trump. It also alleges that Russia sought to damage Hillary Clinton's candidacy, including sharing negative information about Clinton with the Trump campaign. The draft dossier was published in full by BuzzFeed News on January 10, 2017, noting that it was unverified. This was done without permission from Orbis Business Intelligence or Steele. Several mainstream media outlets criticized BuzzFeeds decision to publish the reports without verifying their allegations, while others defended its decision. In October 2015, Fusion GPS was contracted by conservative political website The Washington Free Beacon to provide general opposition research on Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. In April 2016, an attorney for Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC separately hired Fusion GPS to investigate Trump, while The Free Beacon stopped its backing in May 2016. In June 2016, Fusion GPS subcontracted Steele's firm to compile the dossier. DNC officials denied knowing their attorney had contracted with Fusion GPS, and Steele asserted he was not aware the Clinton campaign was the recipient of his research until months after he contracted with Fusion GPS. Following Trump's election as president, funding from Clinton and the DNC ceased, but Steele continued his research and was reportedly paid directly by Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn R. Simpson. While compiling the dossier, Steele passed some of his findings to both British and American intelligence services. The media, the intelligence community, and most experts have treated the dossier with caution due to its unverified allegations, while Trump has denounced it as fake news. The U.S. intelligence community took the allegations seriously, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated every line of the dossier and identified and spoke with at least two of Steele's sources. In January 2017, the primary sub-source said that Steele misstated or exaggerated certain information. The Mueller Report, a summary of the findings of the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, contained passing references to some of the dossier's allegations but little mention of its more sensational claims. Some aspects of the dossier have been corroborated, in particular its main allegations that Putin and Russia actively favored Trump over Clinton and that many Trump campaign officials and associates had multiple secret contacts with Russians. However, many allegations in the dossier remain unverified. One allegation against Michael Cohen was dismissed by the Mueller Report, a court ruled that another of the claims was \\"inaccurate and misleading\\" and stated another claim was inaccurate. Goldman and Savage have described it as \\"deeply flawed\\". The Daily Telegraph has reported that anonymous sources believe Russian intelligence agencies may have sought to create doubt about the veracity of the dossier. Contrary to a conspiracy theory promoted by Trump, Fox News, and many of Trump's congressional supporters, the dossier was not the trigger for the opening of the FBI's \\"Crossfire Hurricane\\" counterintelligence investigation into \\"whether individuals associated with the Donald J. Trump for President Campaign were coordinating, wittingly or unwittingly, with the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\\" It did play a central role in the seeking of FISA warrants on Carter Page in terms of establishing FISA's low bar for probable cause.  History  The opposition research conducted by Fusion GPS on Donald Trump was in two distinct operations, each with a different client. The first research operation, from October 2015 to May 2016, was domestic research funded by The Washington Free Beacon. The second operation, from April 2016 to December 2016, was funded by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Only the second operation involved the foreign research that produced the dossier. From April 2016 into early May, the Washington Free Beacon and the Clinton Campaign/DNC were independently both clients of Fusion GPS.  Research funded by conservative website  In October 2015, before the official start of the 2016 Republican primary campaign, the founders of Fusion GPS were seeking political work and wrote an email to \\"a big conservative donor they knew who disliked Trump, [and] they were hired\\". He arranged for them to use The Washington Free Beacon, an American conservative political journalism website, for their general opposition research on several Republican presidential candidates, including Trump. It is primarily funded by Republican donor Paul Singer. The Free Beacon and Singer were \\"part of the conservative never-Trump movement\\". Early in their investigation, they received help from investigative reporter Wayne Barrett, who gave them his files on Trump. They contained findings about \\"Trump's past dealings, including tax and bankruptcy problems, potential ties to organized crime, and numerous legal entanglements. They also revealed that Trump had an unusually high number of connections to Russians with questionable backgrounds.\\" For months, Fusion GPS gathered information about Trump, focusing on his business and entertainment activities. When Trump became the presumptive nominee on May 3, 2016, the conservative donor stopped funding the research on him. In October 2017, the Free Beacon issued a statement: Although the source of the Steele dossier's funding had already been reported correctly over a year before, and the Free Beacon had issued a statement to this effect in October 2017, a February 2, 2018, story by the Associated Press (AP) contributed to confusion about its funding by stating that the dossier \\"was initially funded\\" by the Washington Free Beacon, so the AP posted a correction the next day: \\"Though the former spy, Christopher Steele, was hired by a firm that was initially funded by the Washington Free Beacon, he did not begin work on the project until after Democratic groups had begun funding it.\\" By the spring of 2016, researchers at Fusion GPS had become so alarmed by what they had already learned about Trump that they felt the need \\"to do what they could to keep Trump out of the White House\\".  Research funded by Democrats produces dossier  The second operation of opposition research was indirectly funded by the DNC and the Clinton campaign, working through their attorney of record, Marc Elias of Perkins Coie. In an October 2017 letter, Perkins Coie general counsel Matthew Gehringer described how, in March 2016, Fusion GPS approached Perkins Coie and, knowing the Clinton campaign and the DNC were its clients, inquired whether its clients wished to pay Fusion GPS \\"to continue research regarding then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, research that Fusion GPS had conducted for one or more other clients during the Republican primary contest.\\" In April 2016, Elias hired Fusion GPS to perform opposition research on Trump. This move was not done without reservations on the part of Simpson, as he did not like the idea of helping Hillary Clinton: \\"'The only way I could see working for HRC is if it is against Trump,' Simpson wrote in an email to his partners.\\" In June 2016, as part of its work for Perkins Coie, Fusion GPS hired Orbis Business Intelligence, a private British intelligence firm, to look into connections between Trump and Russia. Orbis co-founder Christopher Steele, a retired British MI6 officer with expertise in Russian matters, was hired as a subcontractor to do the job. Prior to his work on the dossier, Steele had been a paid informant for the FBI for information unrelated to the Russia investigation. In total, Perkins Coie paid Fusion GPS $1.02 million in fees and expenses, of which Fusion GPS paid Orbis $168,000 to produce the dossier. The DNC and Clinton campaign disclosed the total amount paid to Perkins Coie on campaign finance reports. Orbis was hired between June and November 2016, and Steele produced 16 reports during that time, with a 17th report added in December. The reports were like \\"prepublication notes\\" based on information from Steele's sources, and were not released as a fully vetted and \\"finished news article\\". Steele believes 70‚Äì90 percent of the dossier is accurate, a view shared by Simpson. Simpson has said that, to his knowledge, Steele did not pay any of his sources. According to investigative reporter Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, Orbis has a large number of paid \\"collectors\\" (also called subsources) whose information came from a network of often unwitting sub- subsources. Since payment of these sub-subsources can be seen as bribery or might encourage exaggeration, they are unpaid. \\"According to Steele, his sub- subsources were not paid and were not aware that their information was being passed to Orbis or Fusion GPS.\\" According to British journalist Luke Harding, Steele's sources were not new, but trusted, proven, and familiar sources. Howard Blum said Steele leaned on sources \\"whose loyalty and information he had bought and paid for over the years\\". Steele later informed the Inspector General's investigators that \\"this source network did not involve sources from his time as a [redacted] and was developed entirely in the period after he retired from government service.\\" The Inspector General's report also stated that \\"Steele himself was not the originating source of any of the factual information in his reporting.\\" One sub-source (dossier sources D and E, and \\"Person 1\\" in the IG Report) has been publicly identified as Sergei Millian, an unwitting source who allegedly confided in a compatriot, who then passed that information on to Steele. That information was used in Reports 80, 95, and 102. He denies being a dossier source. Steele delivered his reports individually to Fusion GPS as one- to three-page numbered reports. The first report, dated June 20, 2016, was sent to Washington by courier and hand- delivered to Fusion GPS. The names of the sources were redacted and replaced with descriptions to help Fusion judge their credibility. Luke Harding wrote: Steele has said he soon found \\"troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government\\". According to his sources, \\"there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit\\". According to Harding, \\"Steele was shocked by the extent of collusion his sources were reporting\\", and told his friends: \\"For anyone who reads it, this is a life-changing experience.\\" Steele felt what he had unearthed \\"was something of huge significance, way above party politics.\\" American reporter Howard Blum described Steele's rationale for becoming a whistleblower: \\"The greater good trumps all other concerns.\\" On his own initiative, Steele decided to also pass the information to British and American intelligence services because he believed the findings were a matter of national security for both countries. In June 2020, Steele said that Theresa May's British government covered up the evidence he provided them of Trump's Russian ties and took no actions, and that Boris Johnson suppressed a report about the intelligence in the dossier which was prepared by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee. That report has never been published. According to Simpson's testimony, Steele, who enjoyed a good working reputation \\"for the knowledge he had developed over nearly 20 years working on Russia-related issues for British intelligence, approached the FBI because he was concerned that Trump, then a candidate, was being blackmailed by Russia, and he became \\"very concerned about whether this represented a national security threat\\". Steele believed the intelligence community \\"needed urgently to know‚Äîif it didn't already‚Äîthat the next possible U.S. president was potentially under the sway of Russia.\\" In early July 2016, Steele called seasoned FBI agent Michael Gaeta, who was stationed in Rome, and asked him to come to London so he could show him his findings. Because he was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Rome, Gaeta sought and was granted approval for the trip from Victoria Nuland, who was then the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. When he arrived in London on July 5, 2016, he met with Steele at his office, and he was given a copy of Steele's first report, dated June 20, 2016 (Report 80). His reaction was \\"shock and horror\\". Alarmed by what he read, Gaeta remarked, \\"I have to show this to headquarters\\". As Nuland later shared, \\"In the middle of July, when he [Steele] was doing this other work and became concerned, he passed two to four pages of short points of what he was finding and our immediate reaction to that was, 'This is not in our purview.' This needs to go to the FBI if there is any concern here that one candidate or the election as a whole might be influenced by the Russian Federation. That's something for the FBI to investigate.\\" Shortly after, in July, the report was sent to an agent with expertise in criminal organizations and organized crime at the FBI's New York field office‚Äîessentially, the wrong person to handle a counterintelligence investigation. According to Nancy LeTourneau, political writer for the Washington Monthly, the report \\"was languishing in the FBI's New York field office\\" for two months, and \\"was finally sent to the counterintelligence team investigating Russia at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.\\" in September 2016. In August 2016, the FBI asked Steele for \\"all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources.\\" In October 2016, Steele \\"described the sources' access, but did not provide names\\" to the FBI. By August 22, 2017, Steele had provided them with the names of the sources for the allegations in the dossier. Meanwhile, in the July to September time frame, according to The Washington Post, CIA Director John Brennan had started an investigation with a secret task force \\"composed of several dozen analysts and officers from the CIA, the NSA and the FBI\\". At the same time, he was busy creating his own dossier of material documenting that \\"Russia was not only attempting to interfere in the 2016 election, they were doing so in order to elect Donald Trump... [T]he entire intelligence community was on alert about this situation at least two months before [the dossier] became part of the investigation.\\" The \\"Steele dossier has so far proven to be fairly accurate\\", LeTourneau wrote. In early August, Steele was summoned to Rome where he gave a full briefing to four American FBI officials about the report. At that time, he handed over the June 20 and July 26 reports. During its intense questioning of Steele, the FBI mentioned their own discoveries of connections between the Trump campaign and Russia and asked Steele about Papadopoulos, but he said he knew nothing about him. The agents \\"raised the prospect of paying Steele to continue gathering intelligence after Election Day\\", but Steele \\"ultimately never received payment from the FBI for any 'dossier'-related information\\". The subsequent public release of the dossier stopped discussions between Steele and the FBI. Simpson testified that \\"Steele wasn't paid by the FBI, but was possibly reimbursed for a trip to Rome to meet with FBI officials.\\" According to Mayer, Steele asked the FBI to cover his travel expenses to Rome, but he received nothing. The Inspector General's report later confirmed that the FBI had initially offered to pay Steele $15,000 for his trip to Rome, but when the FBI dropped Steele as a confidential human source because he had shared information with a third party \\"in late October 2016\\" (Mother Jones magazine), the payment was halted. Peter Strzok reported that: Steele met with Jonathan Winer in September, then the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement, whom he had known since 2009. In a 2018 editorial for The Washington Post, Winer recounted that during their meeting in Washington, he was allowed to review Steele's reports, but not to keep a copy: \\"I prepared a two-page summary and shared it with [Victoria] Nuland, who indicated that, like me, she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material,\\" he wrote. Later in September, Winer discussed the report with Sidney Blumenthal, who revealed he had received similar information from Cody Shearer, a controversial political activist and former journalist who was close to the Clinton White House in the 1990s. Winer met with Steele again in late September, and gave him a copy of Shearer's report, later known as the \\"second dossier\\". On September 19, 2016, Steele's handling agent sent six of Steele's reports (80, 94, 95, 100, 101, and 102) to the Crossfire Hurricane team, which had been operational since July 31, 2016. This was the first time they and their leader, Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterespionage Section, Peter Strzok, received any of Steele's reporting. (p. 100). Some reports referred to members of Trump's inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. The IG Report says this material \\"became an important part of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation and the FBI seeking FISA authority targeting one of the Crossfire Hurricane subjects, Carter Page.\\" On October 28, 2016, days before the election, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had started looking into newly discovered Hillary Clinton emails. Simpson and Fritsch described their reaction: \\"Comey's bombshell prompted the Fusion partners to decide they needed to do what they could to expose the FBI's probe of Trump and Russia. It was Hail Mary time.\\" The founders of Fusion GPS were very upset by a November 1, 2016, New York Times article \\"published a week before the election with the headline: 'Investigating Donald Trump, FBI Sees No Clear Link to Russia'. In fact, Russia was meddling in the election to help Trump win, the U.S. intelligence community would later conclude...\\" Simpson later said that \\"Steele severed his contacts with [the] FBI before the election following public statements by the FBI that it had found no connection between the Trump campaign and Russia and concerns that [the FBI] was being 'manipulated for political ends by the Trump people'.\\" Steele had become frustrated with the FBI, whom he believed failed to investigate his reports, choosing instead to focus on the investigation into Clinton's emails. According to The Independent, Steele came to believe there was a \\"cabal\\" inside the FBI, particularly its New York field office linked to Trump advisor Rudy Giuliani, because it blocked any attempts to investigate the links between Trump and Russia. = What the DNC, Clinton campaign, and Steele knew = According to Fusion GPS's co-owners, Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, they did not tell Steele who their ultimate clients were, only that Steele was \\"working for a law firm\\", and they \\"gave him no specific marching orders beyond this basic question: 'Why did Mr. Trump repeatedly seek to do deals in a notoriously corrupt police state that most serious investors shun?'\\" In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Simpson said that \\"it was Fusion GPS's idea to pursue overseas ties-‚Äîthat research was not directed by Perkins Coie, the DNC, or the Clinton Campaign\\". Jane Mayer reported that when the Clinton campaign \\"indirectly employed\\" Steele, Elias created a \\"legal barrier\\" by acting as a \\"firewall\\" between the campaign and Steele. Thus, any details were protected by attorney‚Äìclient privilege. \\"Fusion briefed only Elias on the reports, Simpson sent Elias nothing on paper‚Äîhe was briefed orally\\", Mayer reported. In its application for a FISA warrant to survey Carter Page, the Department of Justice told the FISC that Simpson had not informed Steele of the motivation behind the research into Trump's ties with Russia. Steele testified to Congress that he did not know the Clinton campaign was the source of the payments \\"because he was retained by Fusion GPS\\". By \\"late July 2016\\", \\"several months\\" after signing the contract with Fusion GPS, Steele became aware that the DNC and the Clinton campaign were the ultimate clients. A spokesperson for the DNC said neither Tom Perez nor \\"the new leadership of the DNC were... involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization.\\" A spokesperson for Perkins Coie said the campaign and the DNC were unaware Fusion GPS \\"had been hired to conduct the research\\". The Washington Post reported that it is not clear how much of the research Elias received from Fusion GPS he shared with the campaign and the DNC. It is also not clear who in those organizations knew about the roles of Fusion GPS and Steele, but one person \\"close to the matter\\" said the organizations were \\"not informed by the law firm of Fusion GPS's role\\". The New York Times revealed that earlier in 2017, \\"Mr. Elias had denied that he had possessed the dossier before the election.\\" The Clinton campaign did not know about Steele or that he was sharing his findings with the FBI, and \\"one top Clinton campaign official\\" told Jane Mayer that \\"If I'd known the F.B.I. was investigating Trump, I would have been shouting it from the rooftops!\\" The firewall was reportedly so effective even campaign principals John Podesta and Robby Mook did not know Steele was on the Democratic payroll until Mother Jones reported on the issue on October 31, 2016, in an article which did not name Steele. When the Mother Jones story broke, John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign, said he was \\"stunned by the news that the FBI had launched a full-blown investigation into Trump, especially one that was informed by research underwritten by the Clinton campaign.\\" Although they knew Perkins Coie had spent money for opposition research, neither Podesta nor campaign manager Robby Mook knew Steele was on the Democratic payroll. Mayer said they both maintain they \\"didn't read the dossier until BuzzFeed posted it online\\". She has also said that \\"the Clinton campaign never learned that Christopher Steele was on their payroll until it [the dossier] was in the press.\\" \\"Far from a secret campaign weapon, Steele turned out to be a secret kept from the campaign.\\" In their 2019 book, the founders of Fusion GPS wrote \\"...that no one from Fusion ever met or talked with Clinton and that she herself 'had no idea who they were'.\\" Philip Bump wrote that the dossier \\"has never been shown to have informed the Clinton campaign's approach and that was not made public until shortly before Trump was inaugurated.\\"  Hints of existence  The founders of Fusion GPS have described how they did not hide the fact that they were researching Trump and Russia: \\"Fusion and Steele tried to alert U.S. law enforcement and the news media to the material they'd uncovered...\\" and their office became \\"something of a public reading room\\" for journalists seeking information. In September they arranged a private meeting between Steele and reporters from The Washington Post, The New York Times, The New Yorker, ABC News, and other outlets. The results were disappointing, as none published any stories before the election. Jane Mayer has described how, in \\"late summer, Fusion set up a series of meetings, at the Tabard Inn, in Washington, between Steele and a handful of national-security reporters.... Despite Steele's generally cool manner, he seemed distraught about the Russians' role in the election.\\" Mayer attended one of the meetings. None of these news organizations ran any stories about the allegations at that time. Only two sources mentioned allegations, which we now know came from dossier reports, before the election. Steele had been in contact with both authors. These were a September 23, 2016, Yahoo! News article by Michael Isikoff which focused on Carter Page, and an article by David Corn on October 31, 2016, a week before the election, in Mother Jones magazine. = Mother Jones story = By the third quarter of 2016, many news organizations knew about the existence of the dossier, which had been described as an \\"open secret\\" among journalists, but chose not to publish information they could not confirm. Mother Jones was the first to report the existence of the dossier and that it was exclusively funded by Democrats. By October 2016, Steele had compiled 33 pages (16 reports), and he then passed on what he had discovered to David Corn, a reporter from Mother Jones magazine. On October 31, 2016, a week before the election, Mother Jones reported that a former intelligence officer, whom they did not name, had produced a report based on Russian sources and turned it over to the FBI. The article disclosed some of the dossier's allegations:  Post-election events  After Trump's election on November 8, 2016, the Democratic client stopped paying for the investigation, but Steele continued working on the dossier for Fusion GPS. According to The Independent, at that time, Simpson \\"reportedly spent his own money to continue the investigation\\". According to The New York Times, after the election, Steele's dossier became one of Washington's \\"worst-kept secrets\\", and journalists worked to verify the allegations. On November 18, 2016, Republican Senator John McCain, who had been informed about the alleged links between the Kremlin and Trump, met with former British ambassador to Moscow Sir Andrew Wood at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada. Wood told McCain about the existence of the collected materials about Trump, and also vouched for Steele's professionalism and integrity. According to Simpson's August 22, 2017, testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Steele and David J. Kramer, a longtime McCain aide and former U.S. State Department official working at Arizona State University, met each other at the Halifax forum and discussed the dossier. Kramer told Steele that McCain wanted to \\"ask questions about it at the FBI.... All we sort of wanted was for the government to do its job and we were concerned about whether the information that we provided previously had ever, you know, risen to the leadership level of the FBI.\\" Steele had agreed with Fusion GPS to deliver a hard copy of all 16 reports to McCain, which McCain received in early December from Kramer. On December 9, McCain met personally with FBI Director James Comey and gave him a copy of the dossier. On March 25, 2019, Senator Lindsey Graham, a close friend of McCain's, contradicted Trump's attacks against McCain and revealed that when McCain showed him the dossier, he had encouraged McCain to give the dossier to the FBI and that McCain acted appropriately. Graham described how he confronted Trump: \\"Senator McCain deserves better. There were some McCain people who took a piece of garbage and tried to go after Trump after the election. But I told the president it was not John McCain.\\" Comey later confirmed that counterintelligence investigations were under way into possible links between Trump associates and Moscow. After delivering his 16 reports to McCain, Steele received more information and composed the two-page \\"December memo\\", dated December 13. It mostly contained allegations against Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, which Cohen later denied. In an April 2017 court filing, Steele revealed previously unreported information that he had given a copy of his last report to a \\"senior UK government national security official acting in his official capacity, on a confidential basis in hard copy form\\", because it \\"had implications for the national security of the US and the UK\\". Both Simpson and Steele have denied providing the dossier to BuzzFeed. Unsealed documents from the discovery process in Russian entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev's defamation lawsuit revealed that David Kramer, an associate of John McCain, gave the dossier to BuzzFeed \\"in December 2016, weeks after the election\\", Fresh Air in what Fritsch has called an \\"ill- advised\\" Hail Mary pass. It was never intended that the dossier be public because it was unfinished raw intelligence and could have \\"compromised sources and methods\\". Steele was also worried about the safety of his source network, and he expressed concern that if Trump won the election, the new FBI director, and other agency heads appointed by Trump, might be more loyal to Trump \\"and could decide to take action against Steele and his source network\\". = Briefings of Obama and Trump = On January 5, 2017, the chiefs of four U.S. intelligence agencies briefed President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden about the Russian interference in the election and the existence of the dossier and its allegations. On the afternoon of January 6, 2017, President- elect Trump and his transition team received a similar briefing in Trump Tower. All four of the top intelligence chiefs met with Trump and his transition team. They were Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers. They informed Trump of the Russian election interference, and Comey told them of \\"a piece of Steele's reporting that indicated Russia had files of derogatory information on both Clinton and the President-elect\\". Then, according to a pre-arranged plan, Brennan, Clapper, and Rogers left, and Comey then asked to speak with Trump alone. Comey then informed Trump of the dossier and its allegations about salacious tapes held by the Russians. Comey later reported he was very nervous. The previous day Comey was told to \\"be very careful\\", \\"choose your words carefully\\", and then \\"get outta there\\". Trump became very defensive, and Comey described the meeting as \\"really weird\\". Trump later expressed that he felt James Comey was trying to blackmail him at the meeting in Trump Tower, held two weeks before the inauguration. In April 2018, Comey said he did not inform Trump the dossier was partly funded by Democrats because that \\"wasn't necessary for my goal, which was to alert him that we had this information\\". The Mueller Report, published on April 18, 2019, contains a footnote that suggests that Trump may have heard that Russia had incriminating tapes of his behavior. On October 30, 2016, Michael Cohen had received a text from Giorgi Rtskhiladze reporting that he had successfully stopped the \\"flow of tapes from Russia\\". Rtskhiladze told investigators that these were compromising tapes of Trump, and Cohen told investigators he had spoken to Trump about the issue. Rtskhiladze later told investigators \\"he was told the tapes were fake, but he did not communicate that to Cohen\\". On December 14, 2018, the FBI released a document called \\"Annex A\\", which was \\"part of [the] Russia dossier summary\\" used to brief Trump and Obama. The FBI withheld parts of the synopsis on the grounds that it remained classified and \\"because it pertains to ongoing investigations or court proceedings, originated with a confidential source or describes confidential investigative techniques or procedures\\". Two days after the publication of the dossier on January 10, 2017, James Clapper issued a statement describing the leaks in the press about their Trump Tower meeting with Trump as damaging to U.S. national security. The statement also included the non-committal wording that the U.S. intelligence community \\"has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions\\". This contradicted Trump's previous claim that Clapper had said the information in the dossier was false; Clapper's statement actually said the intelligence community had made no judgment on the truth of the information. James Comey had disagreed with Clapper's wording, but Clapper's wording remained unchanged. Comey later told the Office of the Inspector General of his concerns at that time, because he believed the dossier to be more reliable than indicated in Clapper's non-committal statement:  Publication by BuzzFeed News  On January 10, 2017, CNN reported that classified documents presented to Obama and Trump the previous week included allegations that Russian operatives possess \\"compromising personal and financial information\\" about Trump. CNN said it would not publish specific details on the reports because it had not \\"independently corroborated the specific allegations\\". Following the CNN report, BuzzFeed published a 35-page draft dossier that it said was the basis for the briefing, including unverified claims that Russian operatives had collected \\"embarrassing material\\" involving Trump which could be used to blackmail him. BuzzFeed said the information included \\"specific, unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations of contact between Trump aides and Russian operatives\\". The New York Times commented: \\"Mr. Steele has made clear to associates that he always considered the dossier to be raw intelligence‚Äînot established facts, but a starting point for further investigation.\\" Christopher Burrows, co-founder of Orbis Business Intelligence, does not consider it a \\"dossier\\", but \\"information that is referred to as 'raw intelligence' in intelligence circles.... a mixture of knowledge, rumor and hearsay.... [A]n intelligence agency would enrich the findings with data, test probabilities and write analyses. It's an elaborate process. But Steele is not an intelligence agency.\\" BuzzFeed was harshly criticized by several mainstream media outlets for releasing the draft dossier without verifying its allegations. Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan called it \\"scurrilous allegations dressed up as an intelligence report meant to damage Donald Trump\\", while The New York Times noted that the publication sparked a debate centering on the use of unsubstantiated information from anonymous sources. BuzzFeeds executive staff said the materials were newsworthy because they were \\"in wide circulation at the highest levels of American government and media\\" and argued that this justified public release. A judge in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia agreed with this reasoning when he threw out a libel suit against Steele and Orbis Business Intelligence. The draft dossier's publication by BuzzFeed has always been defended by Jack Shafer, Politicos senior media writer, as well as by Richard Tofel of ProPublica and the Columbia Journalism Review. Shafer defended the public's right to know about the allegations against Trump, and saw a parallel in Judge Ungaro's ruling in the defamation suit filed by Aleksej Gubarev. Ungaro wrote that the \\"privilege exists to protect the media while they gather information needed for the public to exercise effective oversight of the government.\\" She also noted that, before the FBI received any reports from Steele, they had \\"already opened a counterintelligence investigation into links between Russia and the Trump campaign.\\" In relation to a defamation lawsuit filed by Gubarev against BuzzFeed, regarding their publication of the draft dossier, Senior Master Barbara Fontaine said Steele was \\"in many respects in the same position as a whistle-blower\\" because of his actions \\"in sending part of the dossier to Senator John McCain and a senior government national security official, and in briefing sections of the US media.\\" She said that \\"it was not known who provided the dossier to BuzzFeed but Mr Steele's evidence was that he was 'horrified and remains horrified' that it was published at all, let alone without substantial redactions.\\" The founders of Fusion GPS felt so alarmed by what sources reported to Steele that they have defended the fact that they and Steele used intermediaries to pass dossier content to the authorities, but, regarding the publication by BuzzFeed, if it had been up to them, \\"Steele's reporting never would have seen the light of day.\\" They were also alarmed that the leak of the draft dossier would endanger sources, and Glenn Simpson immediately phoned Ken Bensinger at BuzzFeed: \\"Take those fucking reports down right now! You are going to get people killed!\\" Steele wrote: Christopher Burrows said: \\"We didn't expect the findings on Russia to reach the public.\\"  Format  When BuzzFeed published the 35-page dossier in January 2017, the individual reports were one to three pages long, numbered, and page numbers 1‚Äì35 had been handwritten at the bottom. All but one had a typed date at the bottom. Each of the first 16 reports was assigned a typed number in the heading between 80 and 135, but the numeric order didn't always match the chronological order. The 17th report, known as the \\"December memo\\", was numbered 166. Of the original reports numbered 1‚Äì166, only certain reports were used for the dossier, and it is unknown what happened with the content of the other reports: \\"For example, the first report is labeled as '080,' with no indication given as to where the original 79 antecedents might have gone. The second report is then labeled '086,' creating yet another mystery as to 81 through 85, and what content they might contain that would otherwise bolster or contextualize what came before or what follows.\\" Each report started with a page heading in the same style as the first one shown here:  Authorship  The dossier is based on information from witting and unwitting anonymous sources known to counterintelligence specialist Christopher Steele.  Christopher Steele  When CNN reported the existence of the dossier on January 10, 2017, it did not name the author of the dossier, but revealed that he was British. Steele concluded that his anonymity had been \\"fatally compromised\\", and, realizing it was \\"only a matter of time until his name became public knowledge\\", fled into hiding with his family in fear of \\"a prompt and potentially dangerous backlash against him from Moscow\\". His friends later reported that he feared assassination by Russians. The Wall Street Journal revealed Steele's name the next day, on January 11. Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd, for whom Steele worked at the time the dossier was authored, and its director Christopher Burrows, a counterterrorism specialist, would not confirm or deny that Orbis had produced the dossier. On March 7, 2017, as some members of the U.S. Congress were expressing interest in meeting with or hearing testimony from Steele, he reemerged after weeks in hiding, appearing publicly on camera and stating, \\"I'm really pleased to be back here working again at the Orbis's offices in London today.\\" Called by the media a \\"highly regarded Kremlin expert\\" and \\"one of MI6's greatest Russia specialists\\", Steele formerly worked for the British intelligence agency MI6 for 22 years, including four years at the British embassy in Moscow, and headed MI6's Russia Desk for three years at the end of his MI6 career. He entered MI6 in 1987, directly after his graduation from Cambridge University. He currently works for Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd, a private intelligence company he co-founded in London. Sir Andrew Wood, the former British ambassador to Moscow, has vouched for Steele's reputation. He views Steele as a \\"very competent professional operator... I take the report seriously. I don't think it's totally implausible.\\" He also said \\"the report's key allegation‚Äîthat Trump and Russia's leadership were communicating via secret back channels during the presidential campaign‚Äîwas eminently plausible\\". FBI investigators reportedly treat Steele \\"as a peer\\", whose experience as a trusted Russia expert has included assisting the Justice Department, British prime ministers, and at least one U.S. president. Steele's biases and motivations toward Trump appear to have changed over time. Starting in 2007, many years before he started his opposition research on Trump, he repeatedly met Ivanka Trump over several years, had a \\"friendly relationship\\" with her, and was \\"favorably disposed\\" to the Trump family. They even discussed the possibility of the Trump Organization using the services of Orbis Business Intelligence, but no arrangements were made. Simpson has also confirmed that \\"there was no pre-existing animus toward Trump by Steele or Fusion.\\" Later, as Steele was preparing the dossier before the 2016 election, Bruce Ohr said Steele told him he \\"was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president\\", attitudes which have been described by Julian Sanchez as \\"entirely natural, not suggestive of preexisting bias\\", considering Steele believed his own reporting. Steele has disputed Ohr's statement, and he told interviewers for Inspector General Horowitz that Ohr's wording was a paraphrase of his sentiments and not an exact quote, and the IG Report continues: \\"Steele told us that based on what he learned during his research he was concerned that Trump was a national security risk and he had no particular animus against Trump otherwise.\\" (Footnote 427) Steele told the FBI that he \\"did not begin his investigation with any bias against Trump, but based on the information he learned during the investigation became very concerned about the consequences of a Trump presidency.\\" (p. 193) Steele first became a confidential human source (CHS) for the FBI in 2013 in connection with the investigation in the 2015 FIFA corruption case, but he considered the relationship as contractual. He said the relationship \\"was never really resolved and both sides turned a blind eye to it. It was not really ideal.\\" Later, the Inspector General report on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation discusses \\"divergent expectations about Steele's conduct in connection with his election reporting\\", as Steele considered his first duty to his paying clients, and not to the FBI. The Inspector General's report states that \\"Steele contends that he was never a CHS for the FBI but rather that his consulting firm had a contractual relationship with the FBI.\\" (Footnote 200) Steele said \\"he never recalled being told that he was a CHS and that he never would have accepted such an arrangement,...\\" This divergence in expectations was a factor that \\"ultimately resulted in the FBI formally closing Steele as a CHS in November 2016 (although,... the FBI continued its relationship with Steele through Ohr).\\"  Steele's sources  The Inspector General's report stated that \\"Steele himself was not the originating source of any of the factual information in his reporting.\\" Instead, \\"Steele relied on a primary sub-source (Primary Sub-source) for information, and this Primary Sub-source used a network of [further] sub-sources to gather the information that was relayed to Steele.\\" In January 2017, the primary sub-source, later identified as Russian-trained Ukrainian attorney Igor Danchenko, was interviewed for three days by the FBI, and he said that Steele misstated or exaggerated certain information. The FBI found that Igor Danchenko, the Primary sub- source, was \\"truthful and cooperative\\", but the Supervisory Intel Analyst said that \\"it was his impression that the Primary Sub-source may not have been 'completely truthful' and may have been minimizing certain aspects of what he/she told Steele\\". In July 2020, Danchenko was unmasked after declassification of the interview report by Attorney General William P. Barr. Barr, who \\"has repeatedly been accused of abusing his powers to help Mr. Trump politically\\", had ordered the declassification, a move that was criticized by former law enforcement officials as an unmasking that could endanger other sources and make the FBI's work harder. Lindsey Graham had also \\"asked the F.B.I. to declassify the interview report\\". Information about Danchenko's network of sources was provided to the FISA court: BBC correspondent Paul Wood wrote that Steele had \\"20 to 30\\" sources for the dossier.  Allegations  President Donald Trump with Russian President Vladimir Putin at Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, 2018 The dossier contains far more allegations than are presented below, but this article can deal with only those which have been mentioned in multiple reliable sources. The veracity of allegations can vary widely, with some allegations publicly confirmed, others unconfirmed, but, according to James Clapper and Fox News host Shepard Smith, none are disproven. Trump and Putin have repeatedly denied the allegations, and Trump has labeled the dossier \\"discredited\\", \\"debunked\\", \\"fictitious\\", and \\"fake news\\". Below, the allegations are simply presented as they are, but in the section after this one, the widely varying verification status for a number of allegations is examined, sometimes with conflicting reports for or against their veracity, including whether some sources have rejected them. Each allegation should be read as \\"Sources allege... that (and then the allegation).  Cultivation of Trump  * ... that \\"Russian authorities\\" had cultivated Trump \\"for at least 5years\\", and that the operation was \\"supported and directed\\" by Putin. (Report 80) * ... that the Russian government's support for Trump was originally conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, then by the Federal Security Service (FSB), and was eventually directly handled by the Russian presidency because of its \\"growing significance over time\\". (Report 130) The dossier describes two different Russian operations. The first was an attempt, lasting many years, to find ways to influence Trump, probably not so much \\"to make Mr. Trump a knowing agent of Russia,\\" but most likely to make him a source the Russians could use. This operation utilized kompromat (Russian: short for \\"compromising material\\") and proposals of business deals. The second operation was very recent and involved contacts with Trump's representatives during the campaign to discuss the hacking of the DNC and Podesta.  Conspiracy, co-operation, and back channel communication  * ... that there was an extensive and \\"well-developed conspiracy of co- operation between [the Trump campaign] and the Russian leadership\\", with information willingly exchanged in both directions. That this co-operation was \\"sanctioned at the 'highest level' and involved Russian diplomatic staff based in the US\\". That the Trump campaign used \\"moles within DNC as well as hackers in the US and Russia\\". (Report 95) * ... that Trump had \\"so far declined various sweetener real estate business deals\\", but had \\"accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin\\", notably on his political rivals. (Report 80) * ... that Trump associates had established \\"an intelligence exchange [with the Kremlin] for at least 8years\\". That Trump and his team had delivered \\"intelligence on the activities, business and otherwise, in the US of leading Russian oligarchs and their families\\", as requested by Putin. (Report 97)  Why Russia supports Trump  * ... that a major goal of the Russians in supporting Trump was \\"to upset the liberal international status quo, including on Ukraine-related sanctions, which was seriously disadvantaging the country\\". (Report 130) * ... that Putin aimed to spread \\"discord and disunity\\" within the United States and between Western allies, whom he saw as a threat to Russia's interests. (Report 80) * ... that \\"TRUMP was viewed as divisive in disrupting the whole US political system; anti- Establishment; and a pragmatist with whom they could do business.\\" That Trump would remain a divisive force even if not elected. (Report 130)  Changing relationships  * ... that \\"there had been talk in the Kremlin of TRUMP being forced to withdraw from the presidential race altogether as a result of recent events, ostensibly on grounds of his state and unsuitability for high office.\\" (Report 100) * ... that the Trump camp became angry and resentful toward Putin when they realized he not only was aiming to weaken Clinton and bolster Trump, but was attempting to \\"undermine the US government and democratic system more generally\\". (Report 102)  Kompromat and blackmail: Trump  * ... that Trump \\"hated\\" Obama so much that when he stayed in the Presidential suite of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow, he employed \\"a number of prostitutes to perform a 'golden showers' (urination) show in front of him\\" in order to defile the bed used by the Obamas on an earlier visit. The alleged incident from 2013 was reportedly filmed and recorded by the FSB as kompromat. (Report 80) * ... that Trump was vulnerable to blackmail from Russian authorities for paying bribes and engaging in unorthodox and embarrassing sexual behavior over the years, and that the authorities were \\"able to blackmail him if they so wished\\". (Reports 80, 95, 97, 113) * ... that the Kremlin had promised Trump they would not use the kompromat collected against him \\"as leverage, given high levels of voluntary co-operation forthcoming from his team\\". (Report 97) * ... that Trump had explored the real estate sectors in St. Petersburg and Moscow, \\"but in the end TRUMP had had to settle for the use of extensive sexual services there from local prostitutes rather than business success\\". (Report 95) * ... that witnesses to his \\"sex parties in the city\\" had been \\"'silenced' i.e. bribed or coerced to disappear.\\" (Report 113) * ... that Trump had paid bribes in St. Petersburg \\"to further his [business] interests\\". (Report 113) * ... that Aras Agalarov, \\"would know most of the details of what the Republican presidential candidate had got up to\\" in St. Petersburg. (Report 113) * ... that Trump associates did not fear \\"the negative media publicity surrounding alleged Russian interference\\", because it distracted attention from his \\"business dealings in China and other emerging markets\\", which involved \\"large bribes and kickbacks\\" which could be devastating if revealed. (Report 95)  Kompromat: Clinton  Dmitry Peskov (2010s) * ... that Putin ordered the maintenance of a secret dossier on Hillary Clinton, with content dating back to the time of her husband's presidency. The dossier comprised eavesdropped conversations, either from bugging devices or from phone intercepts; it did not contain \\"details/evidence of unorthodox or embarrassing behavior\\", but focused more on \\"things she had said which contradicted her current positions on various issues\\". (Report 80) * ... that the Clinton dossier had been collated by the FSB and was managed by Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary. (Report 80)  Kremlin pro-Trump and anti-Clinton  * ... that Putin feared and hated Hillary Clinton. (Report 95) * ... that there was a \\"Kremlin campaign to aid TRUMP and damage CLINTON\\". (Reports 95, 100) * ... that Putin's interference operation had an \\"objective of weakening CLINTON and bolstering TRUMP\\". (Report 102)  Key roles of Manafort, Cohen, and Page  Paul Manafort mug shot (2018) Michael Cohen (2011) * ... that then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had \\"managed\\" a \\"well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between [the Trump campaign] and the Russian leadership\\", and that he used Trump's foreign policy advisor, Carter Page, and others, \\"as intermediaries\\". (Report 95) * ... that Page had \\"conceived and promoted\\" the timing of the release of hacked emails by WikiLeaks for the purpose of swinging supporters of Bernie Sanders \\"away from Hillary CLINTON and across to TRUMP\\". (Reports 95, 102) * ... that Page was informed by Igor Divyekin, a senior Kremlin Internal Affairs official, \\"that the Russians had kompromat on Clinton and Trump, and allegedly added that Trump 'should bear this in mind'.\\" (Report 94) * ... that Cohen played a \\"key role\\" in the Trump‚ÄìRussia relationship by maintaining a \\"covert relationship with Russia\\", arranging cover-ups and \\"deniable cash payments\\", and that his role had grown after Manafort had left the campaign. (Reports 134, 135, 136, 166) * ... that \\"COHEN now was heavily engaged in a cover up and damage limitation operation in the attempt to prevent the full details of TRUMP's relationship with Russia being exposed.\\" (Report 135)  DNC email hack, leaks, and misinformation  * ... that Russia was responsible for the DNC email hacks and the recent appearance of the stolen DNC emails on WikiLeaks, and that the reason for using WikiLeaks was \\"plausible deniability\\". (Report 95) * ... that \\"the operation had been conducted with the full knowledge and support of TRUMP and senior members of his campaign team.\\" (Report 95) * ... that after the emails had been forwarded to WikiLeaks, it was decided to not leak more, but to engage in misinformation: \\"Rather the tactics would be to spread rumours and misinformation about the content of what already had been leaked and make up new content.\\" (Report 101) * ... that Page had \\"conceived and promoted\\" the idea of [the Russians] leaking the stolen DNC emails to WikiLeaks during the 2016 Democratic National Convention. (Reports 95, 102) * ... that Page had intended the email leaks \\"to swing supporters of Bernie SANDERS away from Hillary CLINTON and across to TRUMP.\\" (Report 102) * ... that the hacking of the DNC servers was performed by Romanian hackers ultimately controlled by Putin and paid by both Trump and Putin. (Report 166) * ... that Cohen, together with three colleagues, secretly met with Kremlin officials in the Prague offices of Rossotrudnichestvo in August 2016, where he arranged \\"deniable cash payments\\" to the hackers and sought \\"to cover up all traces of the hacking operation\\", as well as \\"cover up ties between Trump and Russia, including Manafort's involvement in Ukraine\\". (Reports 135, 166)  Kickbacks and quid pro quo agreements to lift sanctions  Viktor Yanukovych (2013) * ... that Viktor Yanukovych, the former pro-Russian President of Ukraine, had told Putin he had been making supposedly untraceable kickback payments to Manafort while he was Trump's campaign manager. (Report 105) * ... that in return for Russia's leaking the stolen documents to WikiLeaks, \\"the TRUMP team had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and to raise US/NATO defense commitments in the Baltics and Eastern Europe to deflect attention away from Ukraine, a priority for PUTIN who needed to cauterise the subject.\\" (Report 95) * ... that Page had secretly met Rosneft chairman Igor Sechin in Moscow on \\"either 7or 8July\\", together with a \\"senior Kremlin Internal Affairs official, DIVYEKIN.\\" (Reports 95, 135, 166) * ... that Sechin \\"offered PAGE/TRUMP's associates the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent (privatised) stake in Rosneft\\" (worth about $11 billion) in exchange for Trump lifting the sanctions against Russia after his election. (Reports 94, 166)  Cultivation of various U.S. political figures  * ... that the Kremlin had been \\"supporting various US political figures\\", and had funded Moscow visits by Lyndon Larouche representatives, Jill Stein, Carter Page, and Michael Flynn, and was satisfied with the outcome. (Report 101)  Russian spy withdrawn  * ... that Russia had hastily withdrawn from Washington their diplomat Mikhail Kalugin (misspelled as \\"Kulagin\\"), whose prominent role in the interference operation should remain hidden. (Report 111)  Use of botnets and porn traffic by hackers  * ... that Aleksej Gubarev's \\"XBT/Webzilla and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'altering operations' against the Democratic Party leadership\\" and that Gubarev had been coerced by the FSB and was a significant player. (Report 166)  Veracity and corroboration status of specific allegations  Simpson has described his own and Steele's confidence in Steele's work: \\"Nothing that I have seen disproves anything in the dossier. Which isn't to say I think it's all true. I don't think Chris thinks it's all true, either. But there's a difference between things being fake or a hoax or a fraud or a lie and things being incorrect.\\" The Senate Intelligence Committee wrote that the FBI made \\"efforts to corroborate the information in the dossier memos, but the Committee found that attempt lacking in both thoroughness and rigor\\". The FBI stopped all efforts to corroborate the dossier in May 2017 when the Special Counsel's Office took over the Russia investigation. The following content describes how some allegations have been corroborated, while others remain unverified, with sometimes conflicting reports for or against their veracity.  Cultivation of Trump through time  Source(s) for Report 80 (June 2016) alleged that the Kremlin had been cultivating Trump for \\"at least five years\\". Luke Harding writes that documents show Czechoslovakia spied on Trump during the 1970s and 1980s, when he was married to Ivana Trump, his Czechoslovakia-born first wife. Harding writes that the Czechoslovakian government spied on Trump because of his political ambitions and notability as a businessman. It is known that there were close ties between Czechoslovakia's StB and the USSR's KGB. Harding also describes how, already since 1987, the Soviet Union was interested in Trump. In his book Collusion, Harding asserts that the \\"top level of the Soviet diplomatic service arranged his 1987 Moscow visit. With assistance from the KGB.\\" Then-KGB head Vladimir Kryuchkov \\"wanted KGB staff abroad to recruit more Americans.\\" Harding proceeds to describe the KGB's cultivation process, and posits that they may have opened a file on Trump as early as 1977, when he married Czech model Ivana Zeln√≠ƒçkov√°; the Soviet spies may have closely observed and analyzed the couple from that time on. Jonathan Chait has written that 1987 is a year where Russians courted and praised Trump when they invited him to consider building in Moscow. He then visited Moscow in July 1987, and was likely under surveillance, but he did not build anything.  Russian assistance to the Trump campaign  On January 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released the intelligence community assessment of the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. It stated that Russian leadership favored Trump over Clinton, and that Putin personally ordered an \\"influence campaign\\" to harm Clinton's electoral chances and \\"undermine public faith in the US democratic process\\", as well as ordering cyber attacks on the Democratic and Republican parties. John Brennan and James Clapper testified to Congress that Steele's dossier played no role in the intelligence community assessment, testimony which was reaffirmed by an April 2020 bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report. The committee found that the Steele dossier was not used by the assessment to \\"support any of its analytic judgments\\". The Mueller Report backed \\"Steele's central claim that the Russians ran a 'sweeping and systematic' operation... to help Trump win\\". James Comey said: Lawfare has noted that the \\"Mueller investigation has clearly produced public records that confirm pieces of the dossier. And even where the details are not exact, the general thrust of Steele's reporting seems credible in light of what we now know about extensive contacts between numerous individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russian government officials.\\" Newsweek said \\"the dossier's main finding, that Russia tried to prop up Trump over Clinton, was confirmed by\\" the ODNI assessment. ABC News stated that \\"some of the dossier's broad implications‚Äîparticularly that Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an operation to boost Trump and sow discord within the U.S. and abroad‚Äînow ring true.\\" In The New Yorker, Jane Mayer has said the allegation that Trump was favored by the Kremlin, and that they offered Trump's campaign dirt on Clinton, has proven true. Mayer also writes that the CIA had a Russian government official working as \\"a human source inside the Russian government during the campaign, who provided information that dovetailed with Steele's reporting about Russia's objective of electing Trump and Putin's direct involvement in the operation.\\" The spy could actually take pictures of documents on Putin's desk. After Trump's election, the CIA feared their spy was in danger, so the government official was discretely exfiltrated out of Moscow, during a family vacation to Montenegro, because of the dangers imposed by Trump's recent careless disclosures of classified information to Russian officials. On March 14, 2016, George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy advisor, held a meeting with Joseph Mifsud, a man described by James B. Comey as a \\"Russian agent\\". Mifsud, who claimed \\"substantial connections to Russian officials\\", told Papadopoulos the Russians had \\"dirt\\" on Clinton in the form of thousands of stolen emails. This occurred before the hacking of the DNC computers had become public knowledge, and Papadopoulos later bragged \\"that the Trump campaign was aware the Russian government had dirt on Hillary Clinton\\". According to John Sipher, \\"court papers show he was, indeed, told by a Russian agent that the Kremlin had derogatory information in the form of 'thousands of e-mails'.\\" In February 2019, Michael Cohen implicated Trump before the U.S. Congress, writing that in late July 2016, Trump had knowledge that Roger Stone was communicating with WikiLeaks about releasing emails stolen from the DNC in 2016. Stone denied this and accused Cohen of lying to Congress. Papadopoulos sent emails about Putin to at least seven Trump campaign officials. Trump national campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis encouraged Papadopoulos to fly to Russia and meet with agents of the Russian Foreign Ministry, who reportedly wanted to share \\"Clinton dirt\\" with the Trump campaign. When Donald Trump Jr. learned of the offer, he welcomed it by responding: \\"If it's what you say, I love it...\\" Later, on June 9, 2016, a meeting in Trump Tower was held, ostensibly for representatives from Russia to deliver that dirt on Clinton. Instead, the meeting was used to discuss lifting of the Magnitsky Act economic sanctions that had been imposed on Russia in 2012, a move favored by candidate Trump. At the Helsinki summit meeting in July 2018, Putin was asked if he had wanted Trump to win the 2016 election. He responded \\"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.\\"  Manafort's and others' co-operation with Russian efforts  Dossier source(s) allege that Manafort, who had worked for Russian interests in Ukraine for many years, \\"managed\\" a \\"well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between [the Trump campaign] and the Russian leadership\\". The \\"conspiracy\\" is not proven, but the \\"co-operation\\" is seen as proven. While the Mueller investigation did not \\"produce enough evidence\\" to prove the existence of a formal written or oral \\"conspiracy\\", some consider the actions of Manafort, Trump's welcoming of Russian help, and the myriad secret contacts between other Trump campaign members and associates with Russians to be the alleged \\"co-operation\\" with the Russian's \\"'sweeping and systematic' operation in 2016 to help Trump win\\", which the Mueller Report describes as \\"Steele's central claim\\". CNN described Manafort's role in its report of intercepted communications among \\"suspected Russian operatives discussing their efforts to work with Manafort... to coordinate information that could damage Hillary Clinton's election prospects... The suspected operatives relayed what they claimed were conversations with Manafort, encouraging help from the Russians.\\" These reported intercepts are considered \\"remarkably consistent with the raw intelligence in the Steele Dossier... [which] states that the 'well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between [the Trump campaign] and the Russian leadership... was managed on the TRUMP side by the Republican candidate's campaign manager, Paul MANAFORT'.\\"  Russian conversations confirmed  On February 10, 2017, CNN reported that \\"the dossier details about a dozen conversations between senior Russian officials and other Russian individuals\\", and that some of those communications had been \\"intercepted during routine intelligence gathering\\" and corroborated by U.S. investigators. They \\"took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier\\". Due to the classified status of intelligence collection programs, it was not revealed which of the specific conversations mentioned in the dossier were intercepted. U.S. officials said the corroboration gave \\"US intelligence and law enforcement 'greater confidence' in the credibility of some aspects of the dossier as they continue to actively investigate its contents\\".  Kompromat and \\"golden showers\\" allegation  Dossier source(s) allege that Trump \\"hated\\" Obama so much that when he stayed in the Presidential suite of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow, he employed \\"a number of prostitutes to perform a 'golden showers' (urination) show in front of him\\" in order to defile the bed used by the Obamas on an earlier visit. The alleged incident from 2013 was reportedly filmed and recorded by the FSB as kompromat. According to Comey, Trump told him on two occasions it could not have happened because he did not stay overnight in Moscow at the time of the Miss Universe contest. However, according to flight records, Trump was in Moscow for 37 hours. He flew with Phil Ruffin on Ruffin's Global 5000 private jet, arriving in Moscow at around 3p.m. on Friday, November 8, and spent that night in Moscow. According to former federal prosecutor Pete Zeidenberg, such \\"false statements to Comey about the trip could demonstrate that Trump has 'consciousness of guilt'.\\" Thomas Roberts, the host of the Miss Universe contest, confirmed that \\"Trump was in Moscow for one full night and at least part of another. (November 8‚Äì10). According to flight records, Keith Schiller's testimony, social media posts, and Trump's close friend, Aras Agalarov, Trump arrived by private jet on Friday, November 8, going to the Ritz-Carlton hotel and booking into the presidential suite, where the \\"golden showers\\" incident is alleged to have occurred. There were a number of meetings and a lunch that day. Schiller related that a Russian approached them \\"around lunch-time\\" and offered to \\"send five women to Trump's hotel room that night\\". According to \\"multiple sources\\", the offer \\"came from a Russian who was accompanying Emin Agalarov\\". Schiller said he didn't take the offer seriously and told the Russian, 'We don't do that type of stuff'.\\" That evening Trump attended a birthday party for Aras Agalarov. They returned to the hotel after the party. Schiller testified that, \\"On their way up to Trump's hotel room that night, [he told Trump] about the offer and Trump laughed it off\\". He then accompanied Trump to his room, stayed outside the door for a few minutes, and then left. According to one source, Schiller \\"could not say for sure what happened during the remainder of the night.\\" Schiller also testified that he \\"couldn't say if he'd been to Russia more than once....couldn't remember the hotel where he and Trump stayed in Moscow and couldn't remember if they spent more than one night.\\" British music publicist Rob Goldstone believes it was \\"unlikely\\" that Trump used prostitutes while he was in Moscow. He said he accompanied Trump at the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, Trump was in Moscow for 36 hours, and that he was with Trump for 31 of those 36 hours. The next day, Facebook posts showed he was at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. That evening he attended the Miss Universe pageant, followed by an after-party. He then returned to his hotel, packed, and flew back to the U.S. James Comey wrote in his book A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership that Trump asked him to have the FBI investigate the pee tape allegation \\"because he wanted to convince his wife that it wasn't true\\": \\"He brought up what he called the \\"golden showers thing\\"... adding that it bothered him if there was \\"even a one percent chance\\" his wife, Melania, thought it was true.... In what kind of marriage, to what kind of man, does a spouse conclude there is only a 99 percent chance her husband didn't do that?\\" Comey did not know if the \\"golden showers\\" allegation was true, but he came to believe it was possible. In an interview for ABC News, he told George Stephanopoulos: \\"I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don't know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013. It's possible, but I don't know\\". Regarding the \\"golden showers\\" allegation, Michael Isikoff and David Corn have stated that Steele's \\"faith in the sensational sex claim would fade over time.... As for the likelihood of the claim that prostitutes had urinated in Trump's presence, Steele would say to colleagues, 'It's 50‚Äì50'.\\" The book Russian Roulette says that Steele's confidence in the truth of \\"the Ritz-Carlton story was 'fifty-fifty.' He treated everything in the dossier as raw intelligence material‚Äînot proven fact.\\" In their 2019 book, the founders of Fusion GPS report that Steele received the \\"hotel anecdote\\" from seven Russian sources. A 25-second \\"pee tape\\" video of the purported occurrence has been in circulation since at least January 25, 2019. Ashley Feinberg has written extensively about it and all the reports and sources which have discussed and analyzed it. She describes it as believable but fake. A footnote in the Mueller Report suggests that Trump may have heard that Russia had incriminating tapes of his behavior. On October 30, 2016, Michael Cohen exchanged a series of text messages with Giorgi Rtskhiladze, a businessman who had worked with Cohen on Trump's real estate projects. Rtskhiladze reported that he had successfully stopped the \\"flow of tapes from Russia but not sure if there's anything else. Just so you know ‚Ä¶ .\\" Rtskhiladze told investigators that these were compromising tapes of Trump. Cohen told investigators he spoke to Trump about the issue. Rtskhiladze later told investigators \\"he was told the tapes were fake, but he did not communicate that to Cohen.\\" Rolling Stone reported that \\"Rtskhiladze's description of the tapes' content tracks with the unverified information included in the Steele dossier\\". Before the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow, Trump was accompanied on his visit to the Las Vegas club \\"Act\\" by Crocus Group owner Aras Agalarov and his son Emin, who was involved in the invitation to share \\"dirt\\" on Clinton at the Trump Tower meeting. The Agalarovs were also linked to knowledge of Trump's alleged sexual activities in Russia, both in St. Petersburg and the Moscow Ritz Carlton. The dossier's sources reported that Aras Agalarov \\"would know most of the details of what the Republican presidential candidate had got up to\\" in St. Petersburg. In 2013, when Trump stayed at the Ritz Carlton hotel, \\"multiple sources\\", reported that the offer to \\"send five women to Trump's hotel room that night\\" came from a Russian who was accompanying Emin Agalarov\\". A footnote in the Mueller Report describes how Giorgi Rtskhiladze reported that he had successfully stopped the \\"flow of... compromising tapes of Trump rumored to be held by persons associated with the Russian real estate conglomerate Crocus Group\\" [owned by Agalarov]. = Trump viewed as under Putin's influence = Dossier source(s) allege that the Russians possess kompromat on Trump which can be used to blackmail him, and that the Kremlin promised him the kompromat will not be used as long as he continues his cooperation with them. Trump's actions at the Helsinki summit in 2018 \\"led many to conclude that Steele's report was more accurate than not.... Trump sided with the Russians over the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Moscow had waged an all-out attack on the 2016 election... The joint news conference... cemented fears among some that Trump was in Putin's pocket and prompted bipartisan backlash.\\" At the joint news conference, when asked directly about the subject, Putin denied having any kompromat on Trump. Even though Trump was reportedly given a \\"gift from Putin\\" the weekend of the pageant, Putin argued \\"that he did not even know Trump was in Russia for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013 when, according to the Steele dossier, video of Trump was secretly recorded to blackmail him.\\" In reaction to Trump's actions at the summit, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke in the Senate: Several operatives and lawyers in the U.S. intelligence community reacted strongly to Trump's performance at the summit. They described it as \\"subservien[ce] to Putin\\" and a \\"fervent defense of Russia's military and cyber aggression around the world, and its violation of international law in Ukraine\\" which they saw as \\"harmful to US interests\\". They also suggested he was either a \\"Russian asset\\" or a \\"useful idiot\\" for Putin, and that he looked like \\"Putin's puppet\\". Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wondered \\"if Russians have something on Trump\\", and former CIA director John Brennan, who has accused Trump of \\"treason\\", tweeted: \\"He is wholly in the pocket of Putin.\\" Former acting CIA director Michael Morell has called Trump \\"an unwitting agent of the Russian federation\\", and former CIA director Michael V. Hayden said Trump was a \\"useful fool\\" who is \\"manipulated by Moscow\\". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioned Trump's loyalty when she asked him: \\"[Why do] all roads lead to Putin?\\" Ynet, an Israeli online news site, reported on January 12, 2017, that U.S. intelligence advised Israeli intelligence officers to be cautious about sharing information with the incoming Trump administration, until the possibility of Russian influence over Trump, suggested by Steele's report, has been fully investigated. Max Boot described what he sees as more \\"evidence of Trump's subservience to Putin\\", and he tied it to new government confirmations of rumors about Trump's alleged \\"dalliances with Russian women during visits to Moscow\\" that leave \\"him open to blackmail\\", rumors mentioned in the 2020 Senate Intelligence Committee report: Boot wrote: \\"This is the first confirmation from any branch of the U.S. government that rumors of Russian kompromat on Trump ‚Äî a central feature of the infamous Steele Dossier ‚Äî may have some basis in fact.\\"  Kremlin's \\"Romanian\\" hackers and use of WikiLeaks, and Trump campaign reaction  Dossier source(s) allege that \\"Romanian hackers\\" controlled by Putin hacked the DNC servers and that the Trump campaign co-operated with Russia. It was later proven that Russian hackers used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and claimed to be Romanian, like the Romanian hacker who originally used that identity. The Mueller Report confirmed that the dossier was correct that the Kremlin was behind the appearance of the DNC emails on WikiLeaks, noting that the Trump campaign \\"showed interest in WikiLeaks's releases of documents and welcomed their potential to damage candidate Clinton.\\" Thirteen Russian nationals and three companies have been charged for their efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and to support Trump's campaign. They started their campaign in 2014, \\"long before\\" the official start of Trump's campaign, according to Trump. By 2016, they were supporting Trump, concluded the U.S. government. According to CNN, \\"former top Trump campaign officials have corroborated special counsel Robert Mueller's finding that the Trump campaign planned some of its strategy around the Russian hacks, and had multiple contacts with Kremlin-linked individuals in 2016.\\" On February 19, 2020, numerous sources revealed that lawyers for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told Westminster Magistrates' Court Trump had Dana Rohrabacher visit Assange at the Ecuadoran Embassy in London on August 16, 2017. There, he made a quid pro quo offer of a presidential pardon to Assange, in exchange for Assange covering up Russian involvement by declaring that \\"Russia had nothing to do with the DNC leaks\\": \\"[Lawyer] Edward Fitzgerald... said he had evidence that a quid pro quo was put to Assange by Rohrabacher, who was known as Putin's favorite congressman.\\" = Timing of release of hacked emails = Dossier source(s) allege that Carter Page \\"conceived and promoted\\" the idea of [the Russians] leaking the stolen DNC emails to WikiLeaks during the 2016 Democratic National Convention for the purpose of swinging supporters of Bernie Sanders \\"away from Hillary CLINTON and across to TRUMP\\". (Reports 95, 102) In July 2016, in an \\"error- ridden message\\", WikiLeaks urged Russian intelligence to act swiftly to reach this timeline goal: \\"If you have anything hillary related we want it in the next tweo days prefable because the DNC is approaching, and she will solidify bernie supporters behind her after.\\" The New York Times reported that Assange told Democracy Now! \\"he had timed their release to coincide with the Democratic convention\\". The leaks started the day before the DNC national convention, a timing that was seen as suspicious by David Shedd, a former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, who said: \\"The release of emails just as the Democratic National Convention is getting underway this week has the hallmarks of a Russian active measures campaign.\\"  Manafort and kickback payments from Yanukovych  Dossier source(s) allege that Russia- friendly president Yanukovych, whom Manafort advised for over a decade, had told Putin he had been making supposedly untraceable kickback payments to Manafort. After Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014 under accusations of corruption, a secret \\"black ledger\\" was found in the former Party of Regions headquarters. It showed that Yanukovych and his ruling political party had set aside $12.7 million in illegal and undisclosed payments to Manafort for his work from 2007 to 2012. Manafort has denied receiving the payments. Manafort was accused of receiving $750,000 in \\"illegal, off-the-books payments from Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych before he was toppled.\\" From 2006 to at least 2009, Manafort had a $10 million annual contract with Putin ally and aluminum magnate, Oleg Deripaska, a contract under which Manafort had proposed he would \\"influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and former Soviet republics to benefit President Vladimir Putin's government.\\"  Page met with Rosneft officials  Carter Page (2017) Igor Sechin (2016) Dossier source(s) allege that Carter Page secretly met Rosneft chairman Igor Sechin in July 2016. Page denied meeting Sechin or any Russian officials during that July trip, but he later admitted under oath that he met with Sechin's senior aide, Andrey Baranov, who was head of Rosneft's investor relations. Jane Mayer said this part of the dossier seems true, even if the name of an official may have been wrong. Page's congressional testimony confirmed he held secret meetings with top Moscow and Rosneft officials, including talks about a payoff: \\"When Page was asked if a Rosneft executive had offered him a 'potential sale of a significant percentage of Rosneft,' Page said, 'He may have briefly mentioned it'.\\" On November 2, 2017, Page appeared before the House Intelligence Committee which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. In July 2016, Page made a five-day trip to Moscow, but, according to his testimony, before leaving he informed Jeff Sessions, J. D. Gordon, Hope Hicks, and Corey Lewandowski, Trump's campaign manager, of the planned trip to Russia, and Lewandowski approved the trip, responding: \\"If you'd like to go on your own, not affiliated with the campaign, you know, that's fine.\\" In his testimony, Page admitted he met with high ranking Kremlin officials. Previously, Page had denied meeting any Russian officials during the July trip. His comments appeared to corroborate portions of the dossier. Newsweek has listed the claim about Page meeting with Rosneft officials as \\"verified\\". = Brokerage of Rosneft privatization = Dossier source(s) allege that Sechin \\"offered PAGE/TRUMP's associates the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent (privatised) stake in Rosneft\\" (worth about $11 billion) in exchange for Trump lifting the sanctions against Russia after his election. According to Harding, Sechin and Divyekin set this offer up as a carrot and stick scheme, in which the carrot was the brokerage fee (\\"in the region of tens and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars\\"), and the stick was blackmail over purported \\"damaging material on Trump\\" held by the Russian leadership. About a month after Trump won the election, according to The Guardian, Carter Page traveled to Moscow \\"shortly before the company announced it was selling a 19.5% stake\\" in Rosneft. He met with top Russian officials at Rosneft, but denied meeting Sechin. He also complained about the effects of the sanctions against Russia. On December 7, 2016, Putin announced that a 19.5% stake in Rosneft was sold to Glencore and a Qatar fund. Public records showed the ultimate owner included \\"a Cayman Islands company whose beneficial owners cannot be traced\\", with \\"the main question\\" being \\"Who is the real buyer of a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft?... the Rosneft privatization uses a structure of shell companies owning shell companies.\\" Martin Longman, writing for Washington Monthly, found it \\"tantalizing\\" that Steele's \\"prediction that a 19% stake in the Russian energy giant Rosneft would be privatized and made available to Trump or his associates in return for a lifting of economic sanctions.\\" He also found it \\"intriguing\\" that \\"Either that number was floated somewhere in the press or that's a remarkable coincidence or the intelligence was good and the promise was kept.\\" Luke Harding wrote that \\"Steele's Rosneft source was right\\" about the sale: \\"This was one of the biggest privatizations since the 1990s... Steele's mole had known about the plan months before Rosneft's management board was informed. The board only discovered the deal on December 7, hours after Sechin had already recorded his TV meeting with Putin revealing it. Even the Russian cabinet had been kept in the dark.\\" = Trump's attempts to lift sanctions = The dossier says Page, claiming to speak with Trump's authority, had confirmed that Trump would lift the existing sanctions against Russia if he were elected president. On December 29, 2016, during the transition period between the election and the inauguration, National Security Advisor designate Flynn spoke to Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, urging him not to retaliate for newly imposed sanctions; the Russians took his advice and did not retaliate. Within days after the inauguration, new Trump administration officials ordered State Department staffers to develop proposals for immediately revoking the economic and other sanctions. One retired diplomat later said, \\"What was troubling about these stories is that suddenly I was hearing that we were preparing to rescind sanctions in exchange for, well, nothing.\\" The staffers alerted Congressional allies who took steps to codify the sanctions into law. The attempt to overturn the sanctions was abandoned after Flynn's conversation was revealed and Flynn resigned. In August 2017, Congress passed a bipartisan bill to impose new sanctions on Russia. Trump reluctantly signed the bill, but then refused to implement it. After Trump hired Manafort, his approach toward Ukraine changed; he said he might recognize Crimea as Russian territory and might lift the sanctions against Russia. Among those sanctioned were Russian oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska, \\"who is linked to Paul Manafort\\", parliament member Konstantin Kosachev, banker Aleksandr Torshin, and Putin's son-in-law. Preparation for the sanctions started already before Trump took office. In January 2019, Trump's Treasury Department lifted the sanctions on companies formerly controlled by Deripaska. Sanctions on Deripaska himself remained in effect.  Cohen and alleged Prague visit  Dossier source(s) allege that Cohen, together with three colleagues, secretly met with Kremlin officials in the Prague offices of Rossotrudnichestvo in August 2016, where he arranged \\"deniable cash payments\\" to the hackers and sought \\"to cover up all traces of the hacking operation\\", as well as \\"cover up ties between Trump and Russia, including Manafort's involvement in Ukraine\\". (Reports 136, 166) According to a Czech intelligence source, as of January 11, 2017, there was no record of him entering Prague by plane, but Respekt magazine and Politico pointed out that he could have entered by car or train from a neighboring country within the Schengen Area, for example Italy. In the latter case, a record of Cohen entering the Schengen zone from a non-Schengen country should exist. In April 2018, McClatchy DC Bureau reported that the Special Counsel had evidence Michael Cohen had secretly visited Prague in the late summer of 2016, as reported by Steele, and that Mueller's investigators had \\"traced evidence that Cohen entered the Czech Republic through Germany\\", a claim which The Spectator reported was \\"backed up by one intelligence source in London\\". Der Spiegel reported that this entry, using an airfield in Bavaria, is part of a story \\"circulating among intelligence officials in Europe\\". It asserts that Czech intelligence, acting \\"on behalf of an affiliated agency\\", planned to observe \\"a meeting between Solodukhin and another individual. But the surveillance was reportedly called off 'because the matter was too sensitive and the security precautions surrounding the meeting were too tight.' The Russians had 'taken countermeasures'. The Czechs were allegedly not informed by their foreign partners of the reason behind the operation or who might possibly attend the meeting.\\" In August 2018, BBC correspondent Paul Wood wrote: \\"I have spoken to one intelligence source who says Mueller is examining 'electronic records' that would place Cohen in Prague.\\" McClatchy reported in December 2018 that a mobile phone traced to Cohen had \\"pinged\\" cellphone towers around Prague in late summer 2016, and that the signal was \\"picked up by a foreign intelligence agency...\\" raising \\"the possibility that Cohen was not there but one of the many phones he used was\\". McClatchy said their December 2018 report was \\"based on information from five individuals with foreign intelligence connections,...\\" and that each \\"obtained their information independently from each other. McClatchy stands by the reporting.\\" McClatchy also reported that during that time an Eastern European intelligence agency had intercepted communications between Russians, one of whom mentioned that Cohen was in Prague. Cohen reasserted that he has never been to Prague, adding \\"Mueller knows everything!\\" Cohen said publicly he had never traveled to Prague, though he told Mother Jones in 2016 that he had visited Prague briefly 14 years before. He also told The Wall Street Journal that he had been in Prague in 2001. During an interview with Chuck Todd on August 22, 2018, Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis said Cohen was \\"never, ever\\" in Prague, and that all allegations mentioning his name in the Steele dossier were false. Cohen has also said he was in Capri for the time period in question with his family, friends, and musician and actor Steven Van Zandt and that receipts would prove he had been on Capri, but he declined to provide them. Van Zandt's wife, Maureen, said they met in Rome, not Capri. Van Zandt confirmed that he met Cohen and his wife in Rome. The Washington Post sent a team of reporters to Prague in an attempt to verify that Cohen had been there for the purposes alleged in the Dossier. According to reporter Greg Miller, they \\"came away empty\\". Glenn Kessler, fact-checker for The Washington Post, has said the Mueller Report \\"suggests no such meeting in Prague took place\\". Mueller did not indicate he had investigated the claim, \\"he simply dismisses the incident in Cohen's own words as he discusses Cohen's preparation for testimony before Congress.\\" The Mueller Report said Cohen had never traveled to Prague. It did not refer to evidence that Cohen's phone had pinged in or near Prague, as McClatchy had earlier reported. According to the testimony of David Kramer, Steele was uncertain about the \\"alleged Cohen trip to Prague\\". Kramer said: \\"it could have been in Prague, it could have been outside of Prague. He also thought there was a possibility it could have been in Budapest... [but Steele] never backed off the idea that Cohen was in Europe.\\"  Republican position on Russian conflict with Ukraine and related sanctions  In 2015, Trump had taken a hard line in favor of Ukraine's independence from Russia. He initially denounced Russia's annexation of Crimea as a \\"land grab\\" that \\"should never have happened\\", and called for a firmer U.S. response, saying \\"We should definitely be strong. We should definitely do sanctions.\\" With the hirings of Paul Manafort and Carter Page, Trump's approach toward Ukraine reversed. Manafort had worked for Russian interests in Ukraine for many years, and after hiring Manafort as his campaign manager, Trump said he might recognize Crimea as Russian territory and might lift the sanctions against Russia. At the time Trump appointed Carter Page as a foreign policy advisor, Page was known as an outspoken and strongly pro-Russian, anti-sanctions person whose views aligned with Trump's, and who had complained that his own, as well as his Russian friends', business interests were negatively affected by the sanctions imposed on Russia because of its aggression in Ukraine and its interference in the 2016 elections. Dossier source(s) allege that \\"the Trump campaign agreed to minimize US opposition to Russia's incursions into Ukraine\\". Harding considers this allegation to have been confirmed by the actions of the Trump campaign: \\"This is precisely what happened at the Republican National Convention last July, when language on the US's commitment to Ukraine was mysteriously softened.\\" The Washington Post reported that \\"the Trump campaign orchestrated a set of events\\" in July 2016 \\"to soften the language of an amendment to the Republican Party's draft policy on Ukraine.\\" In July 2016, the Republican National Convention did make changes to the Republican Party's platform on Ukraine: initially the platform proposed providing \\"lethal weapons\\" to Ukraine, but the line was changed to \\"appropriate assistance\\". NPR reported that \\"Diana Denman, a Republican delegate who supported arming U.S. allies in Ukraine, has told people that Trump aide J.D. Gordon said at the Republican Convention in 2016 that Trump directed him to support weakening that position in the official platform.\\" J. D. Gordon, who was one of Trump's national security advisers during the campaign, said he had advocated for changing language because that reflected what Trump had said. Although the Trump team denied any role in softening the language, Denman confirmed that the change \\"definitely came from Trump staffers\\". Kyle Cheney of Politico sees evidence that the change was \\"on the campaign's radar\\" because Carter Page congratulated campaign members in an email the day after the platform amendment: \\"As for the Ukraine amendment, excellent work.\\" Paul Manafort falsely said that the change \\"absolutely did not come from the Trump campaign\\". Trump told George Stephanopoulos that people in his campaign were responsible for changing the GOP's platform stance on Ukraine, but he denied personal involvement.  Relations with Europe and NATO  Vladimir Putin (2017) Dossier source(s) allege that, as part of a quid pro quo agreement, \\"the TRUMP team had agreed... to raise US/NATO defense commitments in the Baltics and Eastern Europe to deflect attention away from Ukraine, a priority for PUTIN who needed to cauterise the subject.\\" Aiko Stevenson, writing in HuffPost, noted that some of Trump's actions seem to align with \\"Putin's wish list\\", which \\"includes lifting sanctions on Russia, turning a blind eye towards its aggressive efforts in the Ukraine, and creating a divisive rift amongst western allies.\\" During the campaign Trump \\"called NATO, the centrepiece of Transatlantic security, 'obsolete', championed the disintegration of the EU, and said that he is open to lifting sanctions on Moscow.\\" Harding adds that Trump repeatedly \\"questioned whether US allies were paying enough into Nato coffers.\\" Jeff Stein, writing in Newsweek, described how \\"Trump's repeated attacks on NATO have... frustrated... allies... [and] raised questions as to whether the president has been duped into facilitating Putin's long-range objective of undermining the European Union.\\" Trump's appearances at meetings with allies, including NATO and G7, have frequently been antagonistic; according to the Los Angeles Times, \\"The president's posture toward close allies has been increasingly and remarkably confrontational this year, especially in comparison to his more conciliatory approach to adversaries, including Russia and North Korea.\\"  Spy withdrawn from Russian embassy  Dossier source(s) allege that a \\"\\" participated in U.S. election meddling, and was recalled to Moscow because Kremlin was concerned that his role in the meddling would be exposed. The BBC later reported that U.S. officials in 2016 had identified Russian diplomat Mikhail Kalugin as a spy and that he was under surveillance, thus \\"verifying\\" a key claim in the dossier. Kalugin was the head of the economics section at the Russian embassy. He returned to Russia in August 2016. McClatchy reported that the FBI was investigating whether Kalugin played a role in the election interference. Kalugin has denied the allegations.  Use of botnets and porn traffic by hackers  The validity of the accusation that Aleksej Gubarev's \\"XBT/Webzilla and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'altering operations' against the Democratic Party leadership\\" has been confirmed by an unsealed report by FTI Consulting in the defamation suit(s) Gubarev had filed against others. The report by FTI Consulting said: Cyber security and intelligence expert Andrew Weisburd has said both Gubarev and the dossier \\"can be right\\": \\"Their explanation is entirely plausible, as is the Steele Dossier's description of Mr. Gubarev as essentially a victim of predatory officers of one or more Russian intelligence services.... Neither BuzzFeed nor Steele have accused Gubarev of being a willing participant in wrongdoing.\\" XBT has denied the allegations, and \\"findings do not prove or disprove claims made about XBT in the dossier, but show how the company could have been used by cyber criminals, wittingly or unwittingly.\\"  Veracity of dossier  Steele and the dossier have become \\"the central point of contention in the political brawl raging around\\" the Special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Those who believe Steele consider him a hero who tried to warn about the Kremlin's meddling in the election, and people who distrust him consider him a \\"hired gun\\" used to attack Trump. Glenn Kessler has described the dossier as \\"a political Rorschach test. Depending on your perspective, it's either a hoax used to defame a future president or a credible guide to allegations about Trump's involvement with Russia.\\" The Daily Telegraph reported that anonymous sources believe Russian intelligence agencies may have sought to create doubt about the veracity of the dossier. The dossier's \\"broad assertion that Russia waged a campaign to interfere in the election is now accepted as fact by the US intelligence community.\\" With the passage of time and further revelations from various investigations and sources, it is becoming clearer that the overall thrust of the dossier was accurate: Shepard Smith said: \\"Some of the assertions in the dossier have been confirmed. Other parts are unconfirmed. None of the dossier, to Fox News's knowledge, has been disproven.\\" In some cases, public verification is hindered because information is classified. According to Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, a major portion of the dossier's content is about Russian efforts to help Trump, and those allegations \\"turned out to be true\\". After the Mueller Report was released, Joshua Levy, counsel for Fusion GPS, issued this statement: The Inspector General investigation by Michael E. Horowitz, published December 9, 2019, expressed doubts about the dossier's reliability and sources: Adam Goldman and Charlie Savage have described it as \\"deeply flawed\\" when they mentioned one unproven allegation and a statement by a source.  Reputation in the U.S. intelligence community  The process of evaluating Steele's information has been explained by Bill Priestap, at the time the Assistant Director of the FBI Counterintelligence Division: On January 11, 2017, Paul Wood, of BBC News, wrote that the salacious information in Steele's dossier was also reported by \\"multiple intelligence sources\\" and \\"at least one East European intelligence service\\". They reported that \\"compromising material on Mr. Trump\\" included \\"more than one tape, not just video, but audio as well, on more than one date, in more than one place, in both Moscow and St. Petersburg.\\" While also mentioning that \\"nobody should believe something just because an intelligence agent says it\\", Wood added that \\"the CIA believes it is credible that the Kremlin has such kompromat‚Äîor compromising material‚Äîon the next US commander in chief\\" and \\"a joint taskforce, which includes the CIA and the FBI, has been investigating allegations that the Russians may have sent money to Mr Trump's organisation or his election campaign\\". On January 12, 2017, Susan Hennessey, a former National Security Agency lawyer now with the Brookings Institution, said: \\"My general take is that the intelligence community and law enforcement seem to be taking these claims seriously. That itself is highly significant. But it is not the same as these allegations being verified. Even if this was an intelligence community document‚Äîwhich it isn't‚Äîthis kind of raw intelligence is still treated with skepticism.\\" Hennessey and Benjamin Wittes wrote that \\"the current state of the evidence makes a powerful argument for a serious public inquiry into this matter\\". On February 10, 2017, CNN reported that some communications between \\"senior Russian officials and other Russian individuals\\" described in the dossier had been corroborated by multiple U.S. officials. They \\"took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier\\". Some persons were known to be \\"heavily involved\\" in collecting information that could hurt Clinton and aid Trump. CNN was unable to confirm whether conversations were related to Trump. Sources told CNN some conversations had been \\"intercepted during routine intelligence gathering\\", but refused to reveal the content of conversations or specify which communications were intercepted because the information was classified. U.S. officials said the corroboration gave \\"US intelligence and law enforcement 'greater confidence' in the credibility of some aspects of the dossier as they continue to actively investigate its contents\\". They also reported that American intelligence agencies had examined Steele and his \\"vast network throughout Europe and found him and his sources to be credible.\\" On March 30, 2017, Paul Wood reported that the FBI was using the dossier as a roadmap for its investigation. On January 13, 2019, Sonam Sheth reported that the Senate Intelligence Committee was also using it as a roadmap for their investigation into Russia's election interference. On April 18, 2017, CNN reported that, according to U.S. officials, information from the dossier had been used as part of the basis for getting the FISA warrant to monitor Page in October 2016. Officials told CNN this information would have had to be independently corroborated by the FBI before being used to obtain the warrant. In his testimony before Congress, Glenn Simpson \\"confirmed that the FBI had sources of its own and that whatever the FBI learned from Steele was simply folded into its ongoing work.\\" British journalist Julian Borger wrote on October 7, 2017, that \\"Steele's reports are being taken seriously after lengthy scrutiny by federal and congressional investigators\\", at least Steele's assessment that Russia had conducted a campaign to interfere in the 2016 election to Clinton's detriment; that part of the Steele dossier \\"has generally gained in credibility, rather than lost it\\". On October 11, 2017, it was reported that Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC), had said: \\"As I understand it, a good deal of his information remains unproven, but none of it has been disproven, and considerable amounts of it have been proven.\\" On October 25, 2017, James Clapper said that \\"some of the substantive content of the dossier we were able to corroborate in our Intelligence Community assessment which from other sources in which we had very high confidence.\\" On October 27, 2017, Robert S. Litt, a former lawyer for the Director of National Intelligence, was quoted as stating the dossier \\"played absolutely no role\\" in the intelligence community's determination that Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. On November 15, 2017, Adam Schiff said much of the dossier's content is about Russian efforts to help Trump, and those allegations \\"turned out to be true\\", something later affirmed by the January 6, 2017, intelligence community assessment released by the ODNI. On December 7, 2017, commentator Jonathan Chait wrote that as \\"time goes by, more and more of the claims first reported by Steele have been borne out\\", with the mainstream media \\"treat[ing] [the dossier] as gossip\\" whereas the intelligence community \\"take it seriously\\". On January 29, 2018, a House Intelligence Committee minority report stated that \\"multiple independent sources... corroborated Steele's reporting\\". On January 29, 2018, Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said \\"little of that dossier has either been fully proven or conversely, disproven\\". John Sipher, who served 28 years as a clandestine CIA agent, including heading the agency's Russia program, said investigating the allegations requires access to non- public records. He said \\"[p]eople who say it's all garbage, or all true, are being politically biased\\", adding he believes that while the dossier may not be correct in every detail, it is \\"generally credible\\" and \\"In the intelligence business, you don't pretend you're a hundred per cent accurate. If you're seventy or eighty per cent accurate, that makes you one of the best.\\" He said the Mueller investigation would ultimately judge its merits. Sipher has written that \\"Many of my former CIA colleagues have taken the [dossier] reports seriously since they were first published.\\" During his April 15, 2018, ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos, former FBI Director James Comey described Steele as a \\"credible source, someone with a track record, someone who was a credible and respected member of an allied intelligence service during his career, and so it was important that we try to understand it, and see what could we verify, what could we rule in or rule out.\\" In May 2018, former career intelligence officer James Clapper believed that \\"more and more\\" of the dossier had been validated over time. James Comey told the Office of the Inspector General that: When DOJ Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz issued a report in December 2019 on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, the report noted that the \\"FBI Intel Section Chief told us that the CIA viewed the Steele reporting as 'internet rumor'.\\"  Varied observations of dossier's veracity  Steele, the author of the dossier, said he believes that 70‚Äì90% of the dossier is accurate, although he gives the \\"golden showers\\" allegation a 50% chance of being true. In testimony to Congress, Simpson quoted \\"Steele as saying that any intelligence, especially from Russia, is bound to carry intentional disinformation, but that Steele believes his dossier is 'largely not disinformation'.\\" Steele has countered the suggestion that the Russians deliberately fed his sources misinformation that would undermine Trump: \\"The ultimate Russian goal was to prevent Hillary Clinton from becoming president, and therefore, the idea that they would intentionally spread embarrassing information about Trump‚Äîtrue or not‚Äîis not logical.\\" The Inspector General's investigative team examined how seriously the FBI Crossfire Hurricane team had considered \\"whether Steele's election reports, or aspects of them, were the product of a Russian disinformation campaign\\". Bill Priestap explained to the OIG that by May 2017, after examining several possibilities for how disinformation could affect Steele's reporting, the FBI \\"didn't have any indication whatsoever that the Russians were running a disinformation campaign through the Steele election reporting\\". He further explained how it would make no sense for the Russians, who favored Trump, \\"to run a disinformation campaign to denigrate Trump on the side\\". The IG Report also said Steele explained how sophisticated the Russians were at planting and controlling misinformation, but he \\"had no evidence that his reporting was 'polluted' with Russian disinformation\\". Other observers and experts have had varying reactions to the dossier. Generally, \\"former intelligence officers and other national-security experts\\" urged \\"skepticism and caution\\" but still took \\"the fact that the nation's top intelligence officials chose to present a summary version of the dossier to both President Obama and President-elect Trump\\" as an indication \\"that they may have had a relatively high degree of confidence that at least some of the claims therein were credible, or at least worth investigating further\\". Vice President Joe Biden told reporters that, while he and Obama were receiving a briefing on the extent of election hacking attempts, there was a two-page addendum which addressed the contents of the Steele dossier. Top intelligence officials told them they \\"felt obligated to inform them about uncorroborated allegations about President-elect Donald Trump out of concern the information would become public and catch them off-guard\\". On January 11, 2017, Newsweek published a list of \\"13 things that don't add up\\" in the dossier, writing that it was a \\"strange mix of the amateur and the insightful\\" and stating that it \\"contains lots of Kremlin-related gossip that could indeed be, as the author claims, from deep insiders‚Äîor equally gleaned\\" from Russian newspapers and blogs. Former UK ambassador to Russia Sir Tony Brenton said certain aspects of the dossier were inconsistent with British intelligence's understanding of how the Kremlin works, commenting: \\"I've seen quite a lot of intelligence on Russia, and there are some things in [the dossier] which look pretty shaky.\\" In his June 2017 Senate Intelligence Committee testimony, former FBI director James Comey said \\"some personally sensitive aspects\\" of the dossier were unverified when he briefed Trump on them on January 6, 2017. Comey also said he could not say publicly whether any of the allegations in the dossier had been confirmed. Trump and his supporters have challenged the veracity of the dossier because it was funded in part by the Clinton campaign and the DNC, while Democrats assert the funding source is irrelevant. In June 2019, investigators for Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz found Steele's testimony surprising and his \\"information sufficiently credible to have to extend the investigation\\". In November 2019, the founders of Fusion GPS published a book about the dossier and had this to say about its veracity: David A. Graham of The Atlantic has noted that in spite of Trump's \\"mantra that 'there was no collusion'... it is clear that the Trump campaign and later transition were eager to work with Russia, and to keep that secret.\\" Adam Goldman and Charlie Savage of The New York Times have described the impact of some of the flaws in the dossier:  Discrepancies between sources and their allegations  One of the findings of the 2019 Inspector General's report related to conflicting accounts of sourced content in the dossier. When Steele's Primary Sub-source was later interviewed by the FBI about the allegations sourced to them, he gave accounts which conflicted with Steele's renderings in the dossier and implied that Steele \\"misstated or exaggerated\\" their statements. FBI agent Peter Strzok wrote that \\"Recent interviews and investigation, however, reveal Steele may not be in a position to judge the reliability of his subsource network.\\" The IG found it difficult to discern the causes for the discrepancies between some allegations and explanations later provided to the FBI by the sources for those allegations. The IG attributed the discrepancies to three possible factors: Another factor was attempts by sources to distance themselves from the content attributed to them: The Supervisory Intel Analyst believed this key sub-source \\"may have been attempting to minimize his/her role in the [dossier's] election reporting following its release to the public\\". The FBI found that Igor Danchenko, the Primary sub-source, was \\"truthful and cooperative\\", but the Supervisory Intel Analyst said that \\"it was his impression that the Primary Sub-source may not have been 'completely truthful' and may have been minimizing certain aspects of what he/she told Steele\\". The outing of Danchenko also brought to light an inaccuracy in the dossier, which describes him as a \\"Russian-based\\" source. In fact, although he traveled to Russia to gather information, and his source network is mostly in Russia, he is a Ukrainian-born and Russian-trained lawyer, researcher, and expert in Russian politics who lives in the United States.  Subject of investigations and conspiracy theories  The FBI Operation Crossfire Hurricane investigation into Russian interference, which started on July 31, 2016, was not triggered by the dossier, but the dossier is still the subject of the Russia investigation origins counter-narrative, a conspiracy theory pushed by Trump and Fox News. The Mueller Report, a summary of the findings of the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, contained passing references to some of the dossier's allegations but little mention of its more sensational claims. It was a major subject of the Nunes memo, the Democratic rebuttal memo, and Inspector General report on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. It also figures as part of the Spygate conspiracy theory and conspiracy theories related to the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal. The investigations led to Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson being interviewed in August 2017 by Congress.  Denials of specific accusations   Michael Cohen  Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, says (at 8:50) Cohen was \\"never, ever\\" in Prague. Dossier source(s) allege that Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, met with Oleg Solodukhin and other Russian officials in Prague in 2016 with the objective of paying those who had hacked the DNC and to \\"cover up all traces of the hacking operation\\". Cohen has denied the allegations against him, stating that he was in Los Angeles between August 23 and 29, and in New York for the entire month of September and that \\"I have never been to Prague in my life\\". However, Cohen has twice admitted having previously visited Prague, with the visit either being in 2001 or 2002. Cohen claimed that he was in Capri with Steven Van Zandt at the time of the alleged 2016 Prague trip, but Van Zandt's wife, Maureen, said they met in Rome, not Capri. Cohen stated that he had receipts that showed that he was in Capri, but he did not show them.  Aleksej Gubarev  Gubarev has denied all accusations made in the dossier. The accusations are twofold, as they mention Gubarev and his companies. While it has been proven that his companies were used to facilitate cybercrimes, Andrew Weisburd has said that \\"Neither BuzzFeed nor Steele have accused Gubarev of being a willing participant in wrongdoing.\\"  Paul Manafort  Manafort has \\"denied taking part in any collusion with the Russian state, but registered himself as a foreign agent retroactively after it was revealed his firm received more than $17m working as a lobbyist for a pro-Russian Ukrainian party.\\"  Carter Page  Page originally denied meeting any Russian officials, but his later testimony, acknowledging that he had met with senior Russian officials at Rosneft, has been interpreted as corroboration of portions of the dossier.  Donald Trump  Trump has denied the \\"golden showers\\" allegation, insisting it couldn't be true because he is a \\"germaphobe\\" and did not stay overnight in Moscow at the time of the Miss Universe contest in 2013. The latter claim was soon shown to be false.  Reactions to dossier  November 14, 2017‚ÄîHouse Intelligence Committee transcript of Glenn Simpson August 22, 2017, Fusion GPS testimony transcript of Glenn Simpson  Trump  Donald Trump's first Twitter reaction to the dossier was a January 10, 2017, tweet: \\"FAKE NEWS‚ÄîA TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\\", a view echoed the next day by the Kremlin: \\"absolute fabrication\\". Trump has repeatedly condemned the dossier and denied collusion with Russia, including in this December 26, 2017, tweet, in which he quotes from Fox & Friends: Trump has called the dossier \\"fake news\\" and criticized the intelligence and media sources that published it. During a press conference on January 11, 2017, Trump denounced the dossier's claims as false, saying it was \\"disgraceful\\" for U.S. intelligence agencies to report them. In response to Trump's criticism, CNN said it had published \\"carefully sourced reporting\\" on the matter which had been \\"matched by the other major news organizations\\", as opposed to BuzzFeeds posting of \\"unsubstantiated claims\\". The Wall Street Journal reported that the DNC and the Clinton campaign paid a total of $12.4 million to Perkins Coie for legal and compliance services during the 2016 campaign. This led Trump to claim the dossier had cost $12 million. The actual cost was far less. According to Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie paid them $1.02 million in fees and expenses, and Fusion GPS paid $168,000 to Steele's firm, Orbis Business Intelligence, to produce the dossier. Despite that, Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr. continued to claim for more than a year that Steele was paid \\"millions of dollars\\" for his work. A footnote in the Mueller Report revealed that Trump requested James Comey and James Clapper to publicly refute the dossier. The two men then exchanged emails about the request, with Clapper saying that \\"Trump wanted him to say the dossier was 'bogus, which, of course, I can't do'.\\" On July 11, 2020, Trump tweeted that Steele should be extradited.  Mueller Report  In July 2019, Special Agent in Charge David Archey briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee about certain aspects of the Special Counsel Office's (SCO) \\"investigative process and information management\\": He \\"declined to provide further information on whether FBI or SCO attempted to verify information in the dossier, although he noted that the SCO did not draw on the dossier to support its conclusions.\\"  Others  Russia has backed Trump by attacking the dossier and denying its allegations, calling it an \\"absolute fabrication\\" and \\"a hoax intended to further damage U.S.‚ÄìRussian relations\\". As Putin's press secretary, Peskov insisted in an interview that the dossier is a fraud, saying \\"I can assure you that the allegations in this funny paper, in this so-called report, they are untrue. They are all fake.\\" Putin called the people who leaked the dossier \\"worse than prostitutes\\" and referred to the dossier itself as \\"rubbish\\". Putin went on to state he believed the dossier was \\"clearly fake\\", fabricated as a plot against the legitimacy of President-elect Trump. Some of Steele's former colleagues expressed support for his character, saying \\"The idea his work is fake or a cowboy operation is false‚Äîcompletely untrue. Chris is an experienced and highly regarded professional. He's not the sort of person who will simply pass on gossip.\\" Among journalists, Bob Woodward called the dossier a \\"garbage document\\", while Carl Bernstein took the opposite view: \\"It's not fake news, otherwise senior-most intelligence chiefs would not have done this.\\" Ben Smith, editor of BuzzFeed, wrote: \\"The dossier is a document... of obvious central public importance. It's the subject of multiple investigations by intelligence agencies, by Congress. That was clear a year ago. It's a lot clearer now.\\" Ynet, an Israeli online news site, reported on January 12, 2017, that U.S. intelligence advised Israeli intelligence officers to be cautious about sharing information with the incoming Trump administration, until the possibility of Russian influence over Trump, suggested by Steele's report, has been fully investigated. On January 2, 2018, Simpson and Fritsch authored an op-ed in The New York Times, requesting that Republicans \\"release full transcripts of our firm's testimony\\" and further wrote that, \\"the Steele dossier was not the trigger for the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling. As we told the Senate Judiciary Committee in August, our sources said the dossier was taken so seriously because it corroborated reports the bureau had received from other sources, including one inside the Trump camp.\\" Ken Dilanian of NBC News said a \\"source close to Fusion GPS\\" told him the FBI had not planted anyone in the Trump camp, but rather that Simpson was referring to Papadopoulos. On January 4, 2018, U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled on Trump's repeated tweets describing the dossier as \\"fake\\" or \\"discredited\\": On January 5, 2018, in the first known Congressional criminal referral resulting from investigations related to the Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, Grassley made a referral to the Justice Department suggesting that they investigate possible criminal charges against Steele for allegedly making false statements to the FBI about the distribution of the dossier's claims, specifically possible \\"inconsistencies\\" in what Steele told authorities and \\"possibly lying to FBI officials\\". Senator Lindsey Graham also signed the letter. Both Grassley and Graham declared that they were not alleging that Steele \\"had committed any crime. Rather, they had passed on the information for 'further investigation only'.\\" The referral was met with skepticism from legal experts, as well as some of the other Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary committee, who reportedly had not been consulted. On January 8, 2018, a spokesman for Grassley said he did not plan to release the transcript of Simpson's August 22, 2017, testimony before the SJC. The next day, ranking committee member Senator Dianne Feinstein unilaterally released the transcript. On January 10, 2018, Fox News host Sean Hannity appeared to have advance information on the forthcoming release of the Nunes memo and its assertions about the dossier, saying \\"more shocking information will be coming out in just days that will show systemic FISA abuse.\\" Hannity asserted that this new information would reveal \\"a totally phony document full of Russian lies and propaganda that was then used by the Obama administration to surveil members of an opposition party and incoming president,\\" adding that this was \\"the real Russia collusion story\\" that represented a \\"precipice of one of the largest abuses of power in U.S. American history. And I'm talking about the literal shredding of the U.S. Constitution.\\" In April 2018, the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) gave The Merriman Smith Memorial Award to CNN reporters Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, Jake Tapper and Carl Bernstein. In January 2017, they reported that the intelligence community had briefed Obama and Trump of allegations that Russians claimed to have \\"compromising personal and financial information\\" on then-President elect Donald Trump. WHCA noted that \\"[t]hanks to this CNN investigation, 'the dossier' is now part of the lexicon\\". As late as July 29, 2018, Trump continued to falsely insist the FBI investigation of Russian interference was initiated because of the dossier, and three days later White House press secretary Sarah Sanders repeated the false assertion. Fox News host Shepard Smith said of Trump's assertion: \\"In the main and in its parts, that statement is patently false.\\" Alan Huffman, an expert on opposition research, has compared the two forms of opposition research represented by the dossier and WikiLeaks. He didn't believe the dossier's intelligence gathering to be illegitimate, although \\"a little strange\\", while he was troubled by the large dump of documents from WikiLeaks which \\"may have been obtained in an illegal way\\". In March 2020, Steele commented publicly on the dossier, stating: \\"I stand by the integrity of our work, our sources and what we did.\\"  Litigation  = Against BuzzFeed News and Fusion GPS =  Filed by Gubarev  On February 3, 2017, Aleksej Gubarev, chief of technology company XBT and a figure mentioned in the dossier, sued BuzzFeed News for defamation. The suit, filed in a Broward County, Florida court, centers on allegations from the dossier that XBT had been \\"using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'altering operations' against the Democratic Party leadership\\". In the High Court of Justice, Steele's lawyers said their client did not intend for the reports to be released, and that one of the reports \\"needed to be analyzed and further investigated/verified\\". In response to the lawsuit, BuzzFeed News hired the business advisory firm FTI Consulting to investigate the dossier's allegations. BuzzFeed News has sued the DNC in an attempt to force the disclosure of information it believes will bolster its defense against libel allegations. Fusion GPS \\"has claimed that it did not provide the dossier to BuzzFeed\\". In connection with the libel suit against them by Gubarev, on June 30, 2017, BuzzFeed News subpoenaed the CIA, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. They also sought \\"testimony from fired FBI Director James Comey, as well as former DNI James Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan\\". They were interested in using the discovery process to get information about the distribution of the dossier, how it had circulated among government officials, and the \\"existence and scope of the federal government's investigation into the dossier\\". They hoped \\"the information could bolster BuzzFeeds claim that publication of the document was protected by the fair report privilege, which can immunize reports based on official government records.\\" On June 4, 2018, Judge Ursula Ungaro ruled that BuzzFeed News could claim \\"fair report privilege\\" for the publication of the dossier and its accompanying article, bolstering BuzzFeeds defense. Cyber security and intelligence expert Andrew Weisburd has said both Gubarev and the dossier \\"can be right\\": \\"Their explanation is entirely plausible, as is the Steele Dossier's description of Mr. Gubarev as essentially a victim of predatory officers of one or more Russian intelligence services.... Neither BuzzFeed nor Steele have accused Gubarev of being a willing participant in wrongdoing.\\" On December 19, 2018, Judge Ursula Ungaro sided with BuzzFeed News in the defamation suit filed by Gubarev, defending BuzzFeeds privilege to publish and the public's right to know about the allegations against Trump. BuzzFeed News apologized for publishing Gubarev's name and redacted it.  Filed by Fridman, Aven, and Khan  In May 2017, Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and German Khan‚Äîthe owners of Alfa Bank‚Äîfiled a defamation lawsuit against BuzzFeed News for publishing the unverified dossier, which describes financial ties and collusion between Putin, Trump, and the three bank owners. In October 2017, Fridman, Aven, and Khan also filed a libel suit against Fusion GPS and Glenn Simpson for circulating the dossier among journalists and allowing it to be published.  Filed by Michael Cohen  On January 9, 2018, Michael Cohen sued BuzzFeed News and Fusion GPS for defamation over allegations about him in the dossier. On April 19, 2018, ten days after his home, office and hotel room were raided by the FBI as part of a criminal investigation, Cohen filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the suit.  Filed by Devin Nunes  On September 4, 2019, Devin Nunes filed a racketeering lawsuit in federal court against Fusion GPS seeking $10 million in damages. He accused them of harassment and impeding his investigation into Fusion GPS's role in raising suspicions about Trump's ties to Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. The suit was dismissed on February 21, 2020. = Against Steele and Orbis Business Intelligence = On April 16, 2018, Alfa Bank owners Fridman, Aven, and Khan filed a libel suit against Steele and Orbis Business Intelligence, since the dossier describes financial ties and collusion between Putin, Trump, and the three bank owners. The lawsuit was filed in Washington D.C. Steele's lawyers filed two motions to dismiss the case, accusing the three men of intimidation. On August 20, 2018, a judge in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia threw out the libel suit. The case was dismissed with prejudice in response to a motion by lawyers for Orbis Business Intelligence. Without assessing whether the dossier was \\"accurate or not accurate\\", the judge determined that Steele was protected by the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech. He also cited the District of Columbia's anti-SLAPP law, which prevents the filing of frivolous suits to silence critics. He also pointed out its importance to the public interest: \\"The Steele dossier generated so much interest and attention in the US precisely because its contents relate to active public debates here.\\" On June 18, 2020, an appellate court upheld the dismissal of their defamation lawsuit against Steele and Orbis Business Intelligence. Alfa Bank partners Petr Aven, Mikhail Fridman, and German Khan brought a lawsuit for defamation in Britain against Orbis Business Intelligence, Steele‚Äôs private intelligence firm. In July 2020, Justice Warby from the Queen‚Äôs Bench Division of the British High Court of Justice ordered Orbis to pay damages to Aven and Fridman who Steele claimed had delivered \\"large amounts of illicit cash\\" to Vladimir Putin when Putin was deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. Judge Warby ruled that the claim was \\"inaccurate and misleading\\" and awarded the damages to compensate \\"for the loss of autonomy, distress and reputational damage caused by the breaches of duty\\". The judge stated that Steele's dossier also inaccurately claimed that Aven and Fridman provided foreign policy advice to Putin. Aleksej Gubarev has filed a defamation lawsuit against Steele alleging the dossier made \\"seriously defamatory allegations\\". At issue was whether Orbis/Steele was responsible for the publication of the \\"December memorandum\\" by BuzzFeed, a charge denied by Steele. The defendants said that BuzzFeeds publication of the memorandum was \\"unauthorized\\" and they \\"did not intend the December memorandum or its content to be made public (and) did not provide the December memorandum to BuzzFeed or any other media organization.\\" The Senate Intelligence Committee wrote that \\"Fusion GPS's work for Perkins Coie ended on Election Day. Steele's final memorandum was completed on December 13, 2016. No one paid for it.\\" = Against DNC and Perkins Coie = In October 2018, Carter Page sued the DNC, Perkins Coie, and two Perkins Coie partners, for defamation. The lawsuit was dismissed on January 31, 2019. Page said he intends to appeal the decision. On January 30, 2020, Page filed another defamation lawsuit against the DNC and Perkins Coie, naming Marc Elias and Michael Sussmann as defendants. = Against Mueller and the DOJ = On June 17, 2020, Georgi Rtskhiladze sued Robert Mueller and the Department of Justice for defamation related to the mention of Rtskhiladze in a footnote in the Mueller Report. Rtskhiladze claims that he was falsely identified as a \\"Russian businessman\\" in the footnote. He is a U.S. citizen who was born in Georgia, a former Soviet republic, who emigrated to the U.S. in 1991. He is \\"seeking $100 million in damages and an injunction that would force DOJ to hastily remove all future references to him in the Mueller Report\\".  Conspiracy theories  The Russia investigation origins counter-narrative is a right-wing alternative narrative, sometimes identified as a conspiracy theory, concerning the origins of the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. These conspiracy theories have been pushed by Trump, Fox News, GOP politicians like Representative Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), and Trump's Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. In May 2019, U.S. Attorney General William Barr appointed John Durham to perform an inquiry based on this conspiracy theory, an inquiry described as a cover-up to protect Trump. The conspiracy theory aims to prove the dossier was used as an excuse for the FBI to start their Russia investigation. It also aims to discredit Steele and thus discredit the whole investigation. The dossier could not have had any role in the opening of the Russia investigation on July 31, 2016, as top FBI officials received the dossier the following September. Instead, it was the activities of George Papadopoulos which started the investigation. The investigation by Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz into Russian interference and alleged FISA abuses found that \\"none of the evidence used to open the [original Crossfire Hurricane FBI] investigation\\" came from the C.I.A. or Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier. The founders of Fusion GPS did not expect their connections to Bruce and Nellie Ohr, Steele, Hillary Clinton, and the FBI to \\"become public and subsequently provide the framework for a deep-state conspiracy theory\\". Several conspiracy theories related to the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal involve the dossier. According to The Wall Street Journal, President Trump's actions in the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal stemmed from his belief that Ukraine was responsible for the Steele Dossier. Trump has insinuated that the dossier had its origins in Ukraine, that the Clintons were involved, that Hillary Clinton's email server is currently secreted in Ukraine, and that Clinton's deleted emails are in Ukraine. The dossier is central to Republican assertions that Trump is the victim of an intelligence community conspiracy to take him down. Democrats see this focus on the dossier as conspiratorial. Congressman Devin Nunes, a staunch Trump defender, asserted as fact that the dossier originated in Ukraine during his questioning of EU ambassador Gordon Sondland during the Trump impeachment inquiry hearings in September 2019. Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan have pushed a conspiracy theory that the dossier was based on Russian disinformation.  Legal status as related to U.S. election laws  The legal status of the dossier relates to FEC laws forbidding foreign nationals from contributing to political campaigns, and that applies to any form of aid, not just cash donations. The dossier and the 2016 Trump Tower meeting are frequently contrasted and conflated in this regard. At issue is the legal difference between a campaign expenditure and a campaign contribution. Philip Bump has explained \\"why the Trump Tower meeting may have violated the law - and the Steele dossier likely didn't\\": \\"Hiring a foreign party to conduct research is very different, including in legal terms, than being given information by foreign actors seeking to influence the election. What's more, Trump's campaign did accept foreign assistance in 2016, as the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III determined.\\" The Trump Tower meeting involved a voluntary offer of aid (\\"a campaign contribution\\") to the Trump campaign from the Russian government, and the offer was thus illegal to accept in any manner. Already before the meeting the Trump campaign knew the source and purpose of the offer of aid, still welcomed the offer, successfully hid it for a year, and when the meeting was finally exposed, Trump issued a deceptive press release about it. By contrast, Steele's work was a legal, declared, campaign expense and did not involve any voluntary offer of aid to the Clinton campaign from the Russian government. FEC law allows such declared campaign expenditures, even if performed by foreigners. Bump explains that: Steven L. Hall, former CIA chief of Russia operations, has contrasted Steele's methods with those of Donald Trump Jr., who sought information from a Russian attorney at a meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016: \\"The distinction: Steele spied against Russia to get info Russia did not want released; Don Jr took a mtg to get info Russians wanted to give.\\" Jane Mayer referred to the same meeting and contrasted the difference in reactions to Russian attempts to support Trump: When Trump Jr. was offered \\"dirt\\" on Clinton as \\"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump\\", instead of \\"going to the F.B.I., as Steele had\\" when he learned Russia was helping Trump, Trump's son accepted the support by responding: \\"If it's what you say, I love it...\\"  Legacy  Glenn Simpson believes the dossier interrupted a planned renewal of relationships between the United States and Russia that was \\"not in the interest of the United States\\"; that it supported the existing FBI investigation into Russian interference; and that it furthered understanding of the hidden relationship between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Jane Mayer believes the dossier is \\"perhaps the most controversial opposition research ever to emerge from a Presidential campaign\\", and Julian Borger has described it as \\"one of the most explosive documents in modern political history...\\"  See also  * ''''  * '''' ''''  References   Further reading  ; Books ; Journals, newspapers, magazines ; Timelines * Timeline: The making of the Christopher Steele Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier, The Washington Post, February 6, 2018 * Timeline: Steele dossier and lawsuits, Associated Press, June 29, 2018  External links  Senator Grassley (R) discusses the dossier.

Finnigan founded the Scientific Instruments Division of Electronic Associates, Inc., producing the first commercial quadrupole mass spectrometer in 1964. He then formed Finnigan Instruments Corporation to combine a computer system with a quadrupole mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph. Finnigan's GC/MS/computer systems are used to detect and identify trace organic compounds, making them important instruments for the monitoring and protection of the environment. They were adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a standard instrument for monitoring water quality and were fundamental to the work of the EPA. Early life and education Robert Finnigan was born on May 27, 1927, in Buffalo, New York to Charles M. and Marie F. Finnigan. He was one of seven children, who were raised primarily by their father after their mother's early death. Robert Finnigan entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in June 1945, graduating in 1949 with a Bachelor of Science. On April 1, 1950, he married Bette Earl Van Horn at Perrin Air Force Base in Sherman, Texas. The couple had met while he was at Tyndall Air Force Base near Panama City, Florida. Because of his strong interest and aptitude in electrical engineering, he was able to enroll in an Air Force Institute of Technology program that sent qualified officers to graduate school. In 1952, he entered the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, receiving an M.S. in electrical engineering in 1954 and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1957. His master's thesis work with Edward C. Jordan used the ILLIAC to solve complex mathematical functions in antenna theory. For his Ph.D. he researched servomechanism theory with Gilbert Fett, completing the thesis Transient Analysis of Non-Linear Servomechanisms Using Describing Functions with Root-Locus Techniques. Lawrence Livermore Laboratory In 1957, as a Captain in the United States Air Force, Robert Finnigan joined the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore (later the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). Finnigan worked on Project Pluto, a United States government program to develop nuclear powered ramjet engines for the Supersonic Low Altitude Missile (SLAM), a type of cruise missile. Finnigan led the group that developed computer control systems for the nuclear reactor that powered the missile. In 1959, Finnigan had the choice of rotating to a different tour of duty in the Air Force, or resigning from the Air Force and staying at Livermore. He remained at Livermore for two more years. Finnigan's group developed the Tory II-A prototype and Tory II-C reactor and controls, which were tested at the Nevada Test Site in the 1960s. Stanford Research Institute In 1962, Finnigan and one of his coworkers, physicist and nuclear engineer P. Michael Uthe, Jr., left Livermore to work for the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Palo Alto, California. Finnigan was hired to establish a process controls group in SRI's control systems lab. SRI did contract research projects for both business and the military. One of the projects underway at SRI, led by Kenneth R. Shoulders, was developing a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Finnigan saw the potential for using the quadrupole broadly as a detector for instrumentation and process-control, and began trying to find support for its development and commercialization. Electronic Associates, Inc. In 1963, Finnigan and Uthe joined Electronic Associates, Inc. (EAI). The main research department of the company was based in Princeton, New Jersey, but Finnigan founded a new Scientific Instruments Division in Palo Alto, California. Finnigan's vision involved creation of a broad-based line of process-controlled instruments, beginning with the quadrupole mass spectrometer. Based on previous research at SRI, Finnigan was convinced that a market existed, but EAI and other companies such as IBM and Beckman Instruments were not interested in developing the quadrupole as a product at that time. Finnigan's group proposed to contract parts of the quadrupole production to SRI, but management at SRI were not interested in its commercial development either. Eventually Finnigan collaborated with staff from SRI, who supplied knowledge and expertise to help Finnigan's group bootstrap development of a prototype quadrupole analyzer at EAI. Because of the strong market demand the EAI division was able to sell more than 500 of these quadrupole residual gas analyzers between 1964 and 1966. Finnigan wanted to pursue development of computer-controlled instrumentation for a combined gas chromatograph (GC) and quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS). Hpwever, EAI's main focus was analog computers, and they were not interested in developing a computerized GC/MS. On December 31, 1966, after EAI unsuccessfully attempted to sell the division to Syntex Corporation, Finnigan submitted his resignation to EAI. Finnigan Instrument Corporation In 1967, Finnigan formed Finnigan Instrument Corporation with venture capital from Roger Sant and T. Z. Chu. He was joined by Michael Story from EAI, and William Fies from SRI. In early 1968, Finnigan Instrument Corporation delivered its first prototype quadrupole GC/MS instruments. One was sent to Nobel prizewinner Joshua Lederberg at Stanford University. The other was sent to Purdue University. The first commercial model for a computerized GC/MS, Finnigan's Model 1015/System 150, was introduced soon after for a price of $100,000. The first delivery went to Evan Charles Horning and Marjorie G. Horning at Baylor Medical College. For three years, Finnigan was the only company producing a computerized GC/MS. The next one to be introduced came from the Hewlett-Packard Company in 1971. Quadrupole mass spectrometry offered advantages in terms of size, cost, speed and sensitivity compared to the magnetic-sector mass spectrometry equipment most commonly used at that time. Quadrupoles offered high sensitivity and high pressure tolerance. They could operate with a low voltage ion source. Rapid scanning became feasible because computers could be used to step the spectrometer from one ion peak to the next. This allowed acquisition and display of data in real-time, and gave operators the potential to interact with the system and modify what was being monitored. A major strength of the instrument was precise quantitation. It could be used to detect trace contaminants in environmental samples, to identify drugs in a case of overdose, and to measure drug metabolites. After the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in 1970, it became a major customer for Finnigan's GC/MS. The EPA surveyed possible monitoring instruments for use in monitoring organic pollutants. Speed, cost, and performance were all important concerns. The target machine was projected as having the ability to scan for pesticides with a resolving power of 1,000 to 10,000, across a broad range of 10 nanograms to one microgram. A computer- controlled system was desirable. An international array of instruments were reviewed, of which only two used quadrupole technology. An expert panel recommended Finnigan's quadrupole GC/MS to the EPA for further evaluation, and twenty Finnigan Model 1015/System 150 instruments were ordered soon after by the EPA. Finnigan published a 1979 study, based on users, indicating that in spite of the high initial cost of the equipment, the Finnigan GC/MS was reliable and cost-effective. By 1979, the Finnigan GC/MS was the preferred instrument at the EPA for the analysis of environmental pollutants in water and wastewater. The models most generally used were Finnigan Corporation's 1015 and 3000 series of quadrupole mass spectrometers with a data system based on DEC's PDP-8 computers. The EPA also based its instruction manuals and standards for environmental testing on the Finnigan GC/MS, publishing the results in the Federal Register in 1979. By 1984, all public water was to be tested by using a GC/MS apparatus. In the 1980s, an estimated 60-70% of Finnigan's GC/MS sales went to the environmental market. GC/MS technology, of which Finnigan Instrument Corporation's instrument was the first, was the technical underpinning that made it possible for the EPA to carry out its regulatory efforts in the 1970s. About 100 organic compounds could be identified in water prior to 1970. By 1975, nearly 1500 organic pollutants had been identified. Without the ability to detect such compounds, their monitoring and regulation would not have been possible. When Finnigan Instrument Corporation was acquired by Thermo Instrument Systems (later Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1990, the firm was considered \\"the world's leading manufacturer of mass spectrometers\\". Robert Finnigan continued to consult for the company for several years after the acquisition. He has also consulted with other entrepreneurial companies. Other activities Robert Finnigan served on the board of directors of the trade organization American Electronics Association (AEA). He and Dean O. Morton were founders of the AEA's Environmental and Occupational Health activities. Finnigan also co- founded the Organization Internationale Metrology Legale (OIML) for legal metrology. With the support of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) they developed protocols for international regulations in fifty-one nations. In many cases, these closely matched the standards of the EPA.

She has been credited with reviving interest in the Metropolitan's Art Deco holdings by her authorship of an article in the museum's bulletin which drew attention to the collection. In 1979 Hunter-Stiebel was appointed associate curator of the Metropolitan museum's applied art department; she was the first permanent appointment in that department, and collected many objects of post-war design for the museum's holdings. In 1984 the property developer Donald Trump demolished the former Bonwit Teller department store on Fifth Avenue that was known for its exterior decoration. Hunter-Stiebel and the art gallery owner Robert Miller attempted to persuade Trump to donate the sculptural bronze reliefs from the building to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but they were destroyed. Hunter-Stiebel caught a cab to the building site and attempted to pay the workmen for the sculptures, but was rebuffed.

Christian Millau, who spotted him in 1979, offered him to collaborate with the Gault Millau, promising him a career of rigorous criticism in these terms: \\"In this job, people know how to eat or write, rarely both, sometimes none of the two. If you can do both, you're sure to succeed\\". He latter wrote for Paris Match, Cuisine et Vins de France, (where he created the category of \\"plates\\", awarding one to three plates to good restaurants, the pot with good quality / price ratio and the broken plate, which will make much of his reputation as \\"the Zorro of the critique\\" at the disappointing tables).

Their complete names are: *Declaration between the Governments of Great Britain and the German Empire relating to the Demarcation of the British and German Spheres of Influence in the Western Pacific; April 6, 1886 *Declaration between the Governments of Great Britain and the German Empire relating to the Reciprocal Freedom of Trade and Commerce in the British and German Possessions and Protectorates in the Western Pacific; April 10, 1886 Great Britain and Germany agreed in 1885 to negotiate a common declaration about their spheres of interest in the western Pacific. Previously, German plans of an annexation of New Guinea, outlined in a German newspaper,Sydney Morning Herald, 7 February 1883, summary of an article in the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung, 27 November 1882 and the rapid development of both German and French trade led to unrest among Australian politiciansFabricius 1992 (see External links), p. 167 Both powers wanted to protect the interests of their particular citizens and enterprises, but the western pacific was too less important for them to risk a conflict about it. The negotiation about the declarations began in 1885, they were led between Mr. Thurston for Great Britain and Mr. Krauel for Germany. In April 1886, they were signed by Herbert von Bismarck, State Secretary in the German Foreign Office, and the British ambassador to Germany, Sir Edward Malet.Fabricius 1992, p. 168 The declaration was valid in the whole area between the 15th parallel of north latitude and the 30th parallel of south latitude, and between the 165th meridian of longitude west and the 130th meridian of longitude east.Fabricius 1992, p. 131-132 The border between the spheres of interest should be a line beginning near Mitre Rock in North East New Guinea, on the 8th parallel of south latitude, then it should follow the points: *A. 8¬∞ south latitude, 154¬∞ longitude east *B. 7¬∞10' south latitude, 155¬∞25'east longitude. *C. 7¬∞15' south latitude, 155¬∞35' east longitude. *D. 7¬∞25' south latitude, 156¬∞40' east longitude. *E. 8¬∞50' south latitude, 159¬∞50' east longitude. *F. 6¬∞ north latitude, 1 73¬∞30' east longitude. *G. 15¬∞ north latitude, 173¬∞30' east longitude. The area in the north and west of this line should be the German, the area in the south and east should be the British sphere of influence. The islands of Samoa, Tonga and Niue were excluded. Also excluded were areas under control of other Great Powers. The second declaration guaranteed free trade and enterprise and freedom of establishment and domicile to the citizens of both nations in the whole area. Disputed claims to land prior to the declaration of sovereignty or protectorate, should be settled by a mixed commission, unless the plaintiff did not request the settlement by the local authority alone. Great Britain and Germany should treat each other as most-favoured nation, equal law for citizens of each nation in the area of the other one should be applicated. Religious freedom should be granted. No convicts should be brought in the area and no penal colonies should be founded.Fabricius 1992, p. 134-136 After the declaration, Great Britain colonised the Gilbert and Ellice Islands and the British Solomon Islands, Germany took over the Caroline Islands, Nauru and Bougainville. The British rule lasted up to the 1970s, while the German colonial rule ended in 1920 and was followed by League of Nations mandates, after World War II United Nations Trust Territories, which ended in Nauru in 1968.Nauru: Introduction, CIA World Factbook, retrieved Jan 15, 2017 References External Links and Literature * Fabricius, Wilhelm: Nauru 1888-1900.

The drama of this provocative image stems from the juxtaposition of vivid color and intrusive close-up.\\" Of the large close-up, O'Keeffe said that she decided that she would paint flowers \\"big and they will be surprised into taking time to look at it - I will make even busy New Yorkers take time to see what I see of flowers.\\" Making close-ups of flowers is said to have been influenced by her husband Alfred Stieglitz, a photographer, after they began a more sexual relationship. Along with Black Iris, Liese Spencer of The Guardian calls it one of \\"her lush, sensual paintings of flowers.\\" It fills the nearly four foot wide canvas, without a background, so that the flowers \\"explode\\" on the canvas, and direct the eye to the center of the flowers. It is among her most famous works of art.  Collection  The painting is owned by the Weisman Art Museum of the University of Minnesota, where it was the most valuable painting in their collection. Prior to its acquisition in 1937, it was exhibited by Stieglitz at his gallery, An American Place, in New York City.  Exhibitions  In 2016, Tate Modern in London exhibited Oriental Poppies along with more than 100 of O'Keeffe's major works of art, made over six decades. The exhibition was also held at the Bank Austria Kunstforum in Vienna that year.

Reading at the location was free, but the Association charged dues of 25 cents a month for the privilege to borrow books. In Mrs. John Strentzel and her daughter Louisa Strentzel Muir, wife of John Muir, donated land and a new library was built by popular subscription for . After more than 40 years at that location, voters passed an bond issue to fund a new library building. The new building was designed in an Art Deco style and completed in . In Measure H was passed narrowly by voters in the city of Martinez to renovate and expand the library. The bond specified a designated children's area, youth recreational opportunities, and improving disabled access. The renovation work started in and the library continued operating for 25 hours per week in a temporary location in the old train depot near Martinez station. The library continued operating in the interim Depot Library until when it closed to transition back to the renovated building. The Martinez Library held the Grand Reopening on Saturday with over 1000 visitors entering the library that day. New self-service stations were installed along with new furniture and additional computers. Modern The Martinez Library offers a variety of activities and resources for their patrons. Activities vary from story time and lego workshops for children to book clubs for adults. The library actively seeks to expose patrons to other cultures and has been hosting Chinese Lunar New Year celebration since .

The Day of the Foundation of the Republic is one of the most important holidays of the country, along with the Day of the Sun (birthday of Kim Il-sung), Day of the Shining Star (birthday of Kim Jong-il) and Party Foundation Day. History Following the Liberation of Korea in 1945 by the Soviet and American forces, a communist Soviet military regime was set up in the northern part of Korea. A new Supreme People's Assembly was elected in August 1948, and on 3 September a new constitution was promulgated. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was proclaimed on 9 September, with Kim Il-sung as Premier. Because the date is 9 September, it is also called 9 ¬∑ 9 (old version). National celebrations The holiday is celebrated throughout the country. On this day, events such as art performances, exhibitions, athletic events, and reports are held. On jubilee years (ex: 25th anniversary, 40th anniversary, 50th anniversary, 60th anniversary, 70th anniversary), military parades on Kim Il- sung Square take place with the participation of the leader of North Korea. It is also common for new children to be admitted to the Korean Children's Union on the day. In contrast to many other holidays that are very politicized, the Foundation Day concerns the whole country. It also has an international and diplomatic outlook with foreigners being likelier to attend it than some other holidays. The day was first celebrated in 1949. The intensity of celebrations has varied considerably. Celebrations in 1950 were low key due to the Korean War. In contrast, 1956 saw sizeable celebrations following Kim Il-sung's triumph in a domestic political crisis just days earlier called the August Faction Incident. In 1997 the Juche calendar was adopted on September 9, which became September 9, Juche 86. In 1978, the country celebrated the 30th anniversary of the republic. In honor of the anniversary, Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping attended in his official capacities as the First Vice Premier of the State Council and the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.https://books.google.com/books?id=CyTmfZOs3dcC&pg;=PA103&dq;=parade+in+pyongyang+1978#v=twopage&q;=parade%20in%20pyongyang%201978&f;=falsehttps://kknews.cc/zh- my/world/qqmq9ay.html In 2018, North Korea marked the 70th anniversary of its foundation, during which Russian Federation Council Chairman Valentina Matviyenko and Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, as well as delegations from Cuba, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, the Dominican Republic, Uganda, and South Africa were in attendance during the celebrations. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping was expected to attend the parade during his state visit to North Korea on 9 September, however cancelled his attendance, instead sending Congress chairman Li Zhanshu to Pyongyang.https://m.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2163237/theres-no- point-asking-why-xi-jinping-isnt-going-north-korea For the first time in five years, the Arirang Mass Games will also take place.  National civil- military parade  The semiannual parade, which was a feature of the day since the first parade of 1948, and is also televised on Korean Central Television via tape delay (since 2018), is a key highlight of the national celebrations in Pyongyang. Since 1958, parades have been held on the city's Kim Il-sung Square in honor of the holiday every 5 years, following Chinese practice. The first parade was a purely civil one (and so did others like the parades of 1960, 1968 and 1988) and it was in 1993 that the parade became a civil-military event. The parade is attended by the Supreme Leader of the DPRK in his capacity as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of North Korea, and the current format dates from the parade of 2013. Its commander is a general-ranked officer of the KPA with the rank of either Colonel General or General of the Army (rarely a vice marshal) with the billet of Commanding Officer, Pyongyang Defense Command, with the parade inspector also is a general-ranked officer of the KPA with the rank of either Colonel General or General of the Army (rarely a vice marshal or even a Marshal of the Republic) with higher billets, usually the Chief of the General Staff or Minister of the People's Armed Forces. =Rehearsals= The Korean People's Army prepares for these parades at Mirim Parade Training Ground in the summer and is expected to be one of the largest according to a satellite analysis of the capital. The training ground includes a replica of Kim Il-Sung Square and the central grandstand that is used during rehearsals.https://www.38north.org/2018/01/mirim012418/ =Arrival honors= Before 10 a.m., the parade is formed up as a trumpeter sounds the attention call. To the tune of the massed bands of the Korean People's Army and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, the parade's formations march into Kim Il-sung Square by battalions, each echelon halting and then taking their places in the square. Since 2013 the guard of honor battalion of the Supreme Guard Command, a joint service formation, takes its places in the formation as well together with the massed bands. (A third honor guard company is stationed in front of the Grand People's Study House to receive the arrival of the Supreme Leader and other party and state leaders.) At the stands at the square are distinguished citizens, residents of Pyongyang, veterans of the People's Army and members of the diplomatic corps. At 10 a.m. the Supreme Leader arrives at the grandstand and is received by a field officer of the Army who serves as the commander of the honor guard company, informing him of the readiness of the guard for inspection.http://www.pyongyangtimes.com.kp/LMTXM/?bbs=21006 He is accompanied by the following: * High ranking members of the Central Committee of the WPK, including Politburo * President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly * Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly * Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army * Minister of State Security * Minister of Social Security * Premier of the Cabinet * Presidents of the Supreme Court and Supreme Procurator's Office * Other dignitaries As a secondary band plays inspection music, he inspects the guard company, and following this, he then enters the parade grandstand. At the signal of the conductor of the Massed Bands who then play \\"Song of Happiness for the Great Leader\\", a signature tune adopted in the late 1960s, the Supreme Commander arrives at the central viewing platform of the grandstand with the other invited dignitaries. Upon his arrival, the parade renders a salute and the colours of all participating units are dipped, as all 20,000 service personnel on formation shout Manse! loud while a 21-gun salute is fired. = Ceremonial segment = Female soldiers rehearsing for the parade in 2011. As the music ends, the massed bands on formation sound an opening fanfare and then begin a military tattoo-style segment with the guards of honor as they prepare to reform to ceremonial order, in a tradition that began in 2013. Following this the parade commander takes his place on his vehicle, now set to begin the ceremonial segments of the parade. Following the command to present arms, the parade renders honors to the national flag and the banner of the Workers' Party, which arrive at the square on vehicles. As the colour guards depart, they march on to the two flagpoles at the south end of the square facing the state grandstand, whereby as the massed bands play \\"Aegukka\\" and '\\"Long Live the Workers' Party of Korea\\", the flags are raised. Following this, the parade presents arms again for the inspection phrase. To the tune of the massed bands, the parade commander's vehicle meets with the vehicle of the parade inspector, and as the music stops the parade commander informs the parade inspector for the readiness of the parade to be reviewed for inspection. The report done, the parade inspection begins as each of the battalions forming up the parade are inspected while the bands play, and as they halt the inspector greets the formations assembled. Following this, after all have been inspected, the two then depart to inspect the mobile column, and after the inspector greets the personnel of the column formed into battalions, they both return, as the bands play \\"Victorious Military Parade\\", to the square. As the music pauses, the parade inspector then informs the Supreme Leader that the parade, now formed up and having been inspected, is now ready for the marchpast, the report received the inspector leaves for the grandstand while the parade commander returns to his position. As the inspector arrives and the parade asked to order arms and stand at ease, the fanfare trumpeters sound a fanfare, and as another 21-gun salute is fired the massed bands play both the \\"Song of General Kim il-Sung\\" and the \\"Song of General Kim Jong-il\\", followed by the keynote national address by a high-ranking member of the Party Political Bureau or in some cases, the Supreme Leader himself. Following this, the parade renders a general salute to the memory of both Kim il-Sung and Kim Jong-il as limousines carrying their portraits are driven past, with red flag bearers (formerly colour bearers of KPA formations) escorting them while the massed bands play, the echelons are led by veteran officers of the KPA. (This segment was first introduced in the golden jubilee parade of 1998.) After this segment, the parade commander gives the following commands: As the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the senior director of music of the massed bands gets his conducting baton ready. After the final command, as the bands strike up the mostly locally composed marches the parade's ground column marches out by battalions past the grandstand and into the streets of the capital. As each battalion marches past the grandstand, in a recent tradition that began in the 65th anniversary parade in 2013, the color ensign dips the unit colour and upon finishing the bearer returns the colour to the slope position.

Millard, 23 February 1977, p.16 Family Patrick Ferguson Millard was born at Aspatria, Cumberland in March 1902. His father the Rev. F. L. H. Millard M.A. was vicar of St. Kentigern's Church between 1898 and 1905. His mother was the daughter of Robert S. Ferguson (1837-1900) M.A., LL.M, F.S.A., Mayor of Carlisle in 1881 and again in 1882. Ferguson was also a local historian, author and President of the Cumberland and Westmorland Archaeological Society and editor of its transactions. He was mainly responsible for the founding of Tullie House museum, art gallery, library and at one time the home of the School of Art.West Cumberland Times 2 May 1959 Education It was Millard's godfather, the one time secretary to John Ruskin, the art critic and political economist, W. G. Collingwood who first taught him to draw. Millard's general school education was undertaken at St John's School, Leatherhead, Surrey. Afterwards he studied consecutively at Carlisle School of Art, the Liverpool School of Art, and the Royal Academy Schools, London (1921‚Äì25). At the age of 23 he won the Royal Academy Gold Medal and the Travelling Scholarship for painting. During this period Walter Sickert taught one day a week and it was he who advised him to use his travelling scholarship to go to Paris and this he did, travelling additionally to Italy and Spain, where he fell in love with the work of El Greco at a time when he greatly undervalued. In 1928, he was elected member of the Royal Society of British Artists and shortly afterwards he began to exhibit his work in London and overseas. This was followed by several one man exhibitions. Academic teaching In addition to a number of part-time teaching posts in art schools he held a number of prestigious full- time positions. Towards the end of the 1920s he taught at the Richmond School of Art, where he met and shared a studio with John Piper. He then moved to St John's Wood Art School (1930‚Äì38), where he was joint head at a time when that institution was considered the most progressive of the London art schools. After a three-year period where he was Art Master and House Tutor at Oundle School, Northamptonshire he became senior lecturer in art at Shoreditch Teacher Training College in 1944. He held that position until 1950 when he became headmaster of Polytechnic School of Art, Regent Street, London. In 1958 he became Principal at Goldsmiths College from 1958 until his retirement in 1967. Artist Well-known students of Millard included John Minton and Michael Ayrton, as well as Nancy Haig, and visiting lecturers at \\"the Wood\\" included John Piper and Vanessa Bell. Millard's classes buzzed with ideas. As Nancy Haig put it, \\"He would let you go for a bit, till you were in a helpless mess and then sort you out.\\"Cited by Frances Spalding, John Minton: Dance Till the Stars Come Down, Lund Humphries, 2005, p.23 Millard was a gifted animal draughtsman and frequently took parties of students to the Regents Park Zoo in order to draw the exotic animals they found there. The drawings he himself produced on these occasions have nothing of the character of mere demonstration drawings but have all of the grandeur of animal drawings by David Jones or John Skeaping. His other works on paper were greatly influenced by a deep admiration for the work of the English Romantic artist, Samuel Palmer. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of British Artists and annual show, the New England Art Club and with The London Group. Author Millard was also the author of Student's Book of Life Drawings, published by Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons Ltd, UK (1938); and Birds of the Village, published by Penguin Puffin, Harmondsworth (1945).

Clin Ophthalmol 8 (2014) 571-9. This is because, in addition to the primary sensory role, the nerve also plays a role maintaining the integrity of the cornea by supplying it with trophic factors and regulating tissue metabolism. Neurotrophic keratitis is classified as a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of less than 5 in 10,000 people in Europe. It has been recorded that on average, 6% of herpetic keratitis cases may evolve to this disease, with a peak of 12.8% of cases of keratitis due to varicella zoster virus.Sacchetti M, Lambiase A, Diagnosis and management of neurotrophic keratitis. Clin Ophthalmol 8 (2014) 571-9. The diagnosis, and particularly the treatment of neurotrophic keratitis are the most complex and challenging aspects of this disease, as a satisfactory therapeutic approach is not yet available.Bonini S, Rama P, Olzi D, Lambiase A, Neurotrophic keratitis. Eye 17 (2003) 989-995.  Causes  The cornea lacks blood vessels and is among the most densely innervated structures of the human body. Corneal nerves are responsible for maintaining the anatomical and functional integrity of the cornea, conveying tactile, temperature and pain sensations, playing a role in the blink reflex, in wound healing and in the production and secretion of tears.B.S. Shaheen, M. Bakir, and S. Jain, Corneal nerves in health and disease. Surv Ophthalmol 59 (2014) 263-85. Most corneal nerve fibres are sensory in origin and are derived from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve.L. J. Muller et al., Corneal nerves: structure, contents and function.

Lambiase, Diagnosis and management of neurotrophic keratitis. Clin Ophthalmol 8 (2014) 571-9. Possible causes also include systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus,R. A. Hyndiuk, E. L. Kazarian, R. O. Schultz, and S. Seideman, Neurotrophic corneal ulcers in diabetes mellitus. Arch Ophthalmol 95 (1977) 2193-6. multiple sclerosis or leprosy. Other, albeit less frequent, potential causes of the disease are: intracranial space-occupying lesions such as neuroma, meningioma and aneurysms, which may compress the trigeminal nerve and reduce corneal sensitivity.S. Bonini, P. Rama, D. Olzi, and A. Lambiase, Neurotrophic keratitis. Eye 17 (2003) 989-995. Conversely, congenital conditions that may lead to this disorder are very rare.D. John, M. Thomas, and P. Jacob, Neurotrophic keratitis and congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis‚Äîa case report with 10-year follow-up. Cornea 30 (2011) 100-2.  Diagnosis  NK is diagnosed on the basis of the patient's medical history and a careful examination of the eye and surrounding area. With regard to the patient's medical history, special attention should be paid to any herpes virus infections and possible surgeries on the cornea, trauma, abuse of anaesthetics or chronic topical treatments, chemical burns or, use of contact lenses.S.

Angi, M.R. Romano, M.E. Filippelli, R. Di Iorio, and C. Costagliola, Neurotrophic keratitis. Ophthalmologica 231 (2014) 191-7. or other systemic diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The clinical examination is usually performed through a series of assessments and tools:M. Sacchetti, and A. Lambiase, Diagnosis and management of neurotrophic keratitis. Clin Ophthalmol 8 (2014) 571-9. * General examination of cranial nerves, to determine the presence of nerve damage. * Eye examinations: # Complete eye examination: examination of the eyelids, blink rate, presence of inflammatory reactions and secretions, corneal epithelial alterations. # Corneal sensitivity test: performed by placing a cotton wad or cotton thread in contact with the corneal surface: this only allows to determine whether corneal sensitivity is normal, reduced or absent; or using an esthesiometer that allows to assess corneal sensitivity. # Tear film function test, such as Schirmer's test, and tear film break-up time. # Fluorescein eye stain test, which shows any damage to the corneal and conjunctival epithelium  Classification  According to Mackie's classification, neurotrophic keratitis can be divided into three stages based on severity: # Stage I: characterized by alterations of the corneal epithelium, which is dry and opaque, with superficial punctate keratopathy and corneal oedema. Long-lasting neurotrophic keratitis may also cause hyperplasia of the epithelium, stromal scarring and neovascularization of the cornea. # Stage II: characterized by development of epithelial defects, often in the area near the centre of the cornea. # Stage III: characterized by ulcers of the cornea accompanied by stromal oedema and/or melting that may result in corneal perforation.M. Sacchetti, and A. Lambiase, Diagnosis and management of neurotrophic keratitis. Clin Ophthalmol 8 (2014) 571-9.  Treatment  Early diagnosis, targeted treatment according to the severity of the disease, and regular monitoring of patients with neurotrophic keratitis are critical to prevent damage progression and the occurrence of corneal ulcers, especially considering that the deterioration of the condition is often poorly symptomatic.M. Sacchetti, and A. Lambiase, Diagnosis and management of neurotrophic keratitis. Clin Ophthalmol 8 (2014) 571-9. The purpose of treatment is to prevent the progression of corneal damage and promote healing of the corneal epithelium. The treatment should always be personalized according to the severity of the disease. Conservative treatment is typically the best option. In stage I, the least serious, treatment consists of the administration of preservative-free artificial tears several times a day in order to lubricate and protect the ocular surface, improving the quality of the epithelium and preventing the possible loss of transparency of the cornea. In stage II, treatment should be aimed at preventing the development of corneal ulcers and promoting the healing of epithelial lesions. In addition to artificial tears, topical antibiotics may also be prescribed to prevent possible infections. Patients should be monitored very carefully since, being the disease poorly symptomatic, the corneal damage may progress without the patient noticing any worsening of the symptoms. Corneal contact lenses can also be used in this stage of the disease, for their protective action to improve corneal healing.H. L. Gould, Treatment of neurotrophic keratitis with scleral contact lenses. Eye Ear Nose Throat Mon 46 (1967) 1406-14. In the most severe forms (stage III), it is necessary to stop the progression towards corneal perforation: in these cases, a possible surgical treatment option is tarsorrhaphy, i.e. the temporary or permanent closure of the eyelids by means of sutures or botulinum toxin injection. This protects the cornea, although the aesthetic result of these procedures may be difficult to accept for patients. Similarly, a procedure that entails the creation of a conjunctival flap has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic corneal ulcers with or without corneal perforation.M. Sacchetti, and A. Lambiase, Diagnosis and management of neurotrophic keratitis. Clin Ophthalmol 8 (2014) 571-9. In addition, another viable therapeutic option is amniotic membrane graft, which has recently been shown to play a role in stimulating corneal epithelium healing and in reducing vascularisation and inflammation of the ocular surface.Turkoglu E, Celik E, and Alagoz G, A comparison of the efficacy of autologous serum eye drops with amniotic membrane transplantation in neurotrophic keratitis. Semin Ophthalmol 29 (2014) 119-26. Other approaches used in severe forms include the administration of autologous serum eye drops.Turkoglu E, Celik E, and Alagoz G, A comparison of the efficacy of autologous serum eye drops with amniotic membrane transplantation in neurotrophic keratitis. Semin Ophthalmol 29 (2014) 119-26. Research studies have focused on developing novel treatments for neurotrophic keratitis, and several polypeptides, growth factors and neuromediators have been proposed.Mastropasqua L, Massaro-Giordano G, Nubile M, Sacchetti M, Understanding the Pathogenesis of Neurotrophic Keratitis: The Role of Corneal Nerves.

Cornea 34 Suppl 11 (2015) S121-7 Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) play a role in the epithelial proliferation and differentiation and in the survival of corneal sensory nerves. Topical treatment with murine NGF showed to promote recovery of epithelial integrity and corneal sensitivity in NK patients.Lambiase A, Rama P, Bonini S, Caprioglio G, Aloe L. Topical treatment with nerve growth factor for corneal neurotrophic ulcers. N Engl J Med. 1998;338(17):1174-80. Recently, a recombinant human nerve growth factor eye drop formulation has been developed for clinical use.Sacchetti M, Lambiase A, Diagnosis and management of neurotrophic keratitis.

It is located within Pathum Wan District, next to its border with Bang Rak, where Si Lom meets Rama IV and Ratchadamri Roads. The Thai‚ÄìJapan Flyover Bridge, constructed in 1992, passes over Sala Daeng intersection, as well as the westward Henri Dunant and Sam Yan intersections, along Rama IV Road. A small street, known as Sala Daeng Road, branches off Si Lom Road (near the intersection) and connects to the parallel Sathon Road. The intersection area is served by the Sala Daeng Station of the BTS skytrain's Silom Line and the Si Lom Station of the underground MRT's Blue Line, forming one of the two systems' three interchanges and a gateway into the main business district of Si Lom Road, which begins here. On the corners of the intersection are Lumphini Park, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital and the Dusit Thani Hotel. History In the nineteenth century, the area consisted of paddy fields far from the city centre. When the Paknam Railway was built around 1893, linking Bangkok to Samut Prakan, a station was built in the area, at what is now approximately in front of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. The station building was painted red, leading it to be called Sala Daeng, which means \\"red pavilion\\". The field thus became known after the station as Thung Sala Daeng (, \\"Sala Daeng field\\"). King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) later bought the land in the area and developed it as Lumphini Park. Subsequent development led to the area becoming part of Bangkok's busiest commercial centres, and Sala Daeng Intersection has been known as one of the busiest in the city.

On 11 August 1736, he received his own company in the Cuirassier Regiment \\"Gessler\\" No. 4. In the same year, he was accepted into the Johanniterorden in Sonnenburg. At the beginning of the First Silesian War (also called the War of Austrian Succession), he was Rittmeister, a captain of cavalry. His regiment was late for the Battle of Mollwitz but, in 1742, his regiment was involved in the thick of action at the Battle of Chotusitz. He was awarded the Pour le M√©rite for his part in executing a successful retreat to Camenz. He was later promoted to major. In 1744 he fought in Bohemia and Moravia. On 22 May 1747, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel; in 1752, he was part of the famed Bayreuth Dragoons and, in 1755, second commander in the Dragoon Regiment \\"Normann\\", No. 1. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Promotions * Cornet: 1723 * Second Lieutenant: 1731 * First (Premier) Lieutenant: 7 July 1730 * Rittmeister (captain of cavalry): 1741 * Major: 1744 * Lieutenant colonel: 22 May 1747 * Generalmajor: 4 March 1757 * Generalleutnant: 12 May 1759 * General of Cavalry: 7 June 1787 } Action in the Seven Years' War In the Seven Years' War, Friedrich von Platen's regiment went to Saxony in 1756. On 4 March 1757, Platen received the Dragoon Regiment \\"Langermann\\" No. 8 as Inhaber (Proprietor) and was promoted to generalmajor. On 15 April 1757 he fought at Gross-J√§gersdorf. After the battle, the regiment was transferred to Pomerania to defend it against the Swedes and fought there at the Siege of Stralsund. At the beginning of 1758, the regiment was transferred to Farther Pomerania, where it was deployed until June against the Russians. He fought on 25 August at the Battle of Zorndorf, where two of his sons died. After the Russian retreat, the regiment drove back troops from such Russian-occupied Pomeranian towns as Gollnow and Greifenberg. He then moved north against the Swedes and his regiment occupied Prenzlau after the Battle of Pasewalk in December. On 17 January 1759, he took part in the capture of Demmin, after which he was again deployed against the Russians, this time in the Stolp area. Frederick II at the Battle of Zorndorf, where two of Platen's sons were killed. On 12 May 1759, Platen was promoted to generalleutnant, and was given command of the cavalry in the army of Prince Henry, the King's brother, operating in Saxony. The prince sent Platen on a successful marauding expedition with Frederick William von Kleist to the Bamberg area; afterward, Platen joined the King's army for the Prussian loss at Kunersdorf. In May 1760, he was sent, with General Friedrich Wilhelm Quirin von Forcade de Biaix, to the Pomeranian Neumark, with instructions to halt the advance of General Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben and his Russian army into Prussia. Subsequently, Platen was ordered to Landsberg to block the approach of the Russians and Austrians into Silesia and, most importantly, to defend the city of Breslau. Despite his efforts, in October 1760, the Russians under command of Totleben and Ivan Chernyshyov, and the Austrian army commanded by Franz Moritz von Lacy, occupied Berlin. After the withdrawal of the Russians and Austrians from Berlin, Platen rejoined the King's main army and fought on 3 November at the Battle of Torgau. On 10 September 1761, he marched with the army to Poland to attack the Russian supply depots. He destroyed the Russian magazine in K√∂blin. On 15 September, he met a large Russian group of 5,000 wagons and 4,000 men near a monastery in G√∂stin. Joined by battalions from the Regiments \\"von Rothenburg\\", \\"von Arnim\\", \\"G√∂rne\\" and \\"von Wunsch\\", he captured a large Russian magazine. From there, he proceeded to Posen, where he captured another magazine on 17 September. Meanwhile, the Russians had besieged Kolberg for the third time, and had thwarted all Prussian relief efforts. In an action at Landsberg, with the principal bridge over the Warta river destroyed, Platen's troops crossed the river with the help of pontoons and rafts. At K√∂rlin, on 30 September, he was able to recapture from the Russians an intact bridge over the Parsƒôta river, taking 200 prisoners in the action. From there, he attempted to reach the besieged fortress by marching along the Parsƒôta shore. After a three-hour battle southwest of Kolberg, though, the Russian forces commanded by Pyotr Rumyantsev stopped him at the village of Spie. On 17 October, he tried to break through to Gollnow with 5,500 men to secure supplies from there, but the Russian general William Fermor stopped him in an artillery duel at the bridge over the Ihna. Ultimately, when he could not relieve the fortress, Kolberg had to capitulate on 16 December 1761 and its garrison entered into Russian captivity. In January 1762, Platen returned to Saxony to the army of Prince Henry's army, where his regiment was stationed at Pegau and Zeitz and had no part in the fighting of the year. War of the Bavarian Succession In the War of Bavarian Succession, he commanded a corps in the army of Prince Heinrich, with whom he advanced on Prague, Peterswalde, Leitmeritz, and Budin an der Eger. In September 1786 he received from Frederick William II the Black Eagle Order. At the same time, the King appointed Platen as governor of K√∂nigsberg, an office which Platen did not want, but which he was persuaded to accept. On 20 May 1787 he became general of the cavalry and died shortly afterward on 7 June 1787. His name was perpetuated on the front of the Rheinsberg obelisk and on one of the honorary plates on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great established by Frederick's great great nephew, Frederick William IV of Prussia.

The aircraft was able to dump fuel over the Pacific Ocean and return to San Francisco for an overweight landing, but the occurrence prompted United to change pilot training requirements. Flight Flight 863 to Sydney departed from San Francisco International Airport at 10:39 pm PST on Sunday 28 June 1998 (UTC: 5:39 am, 29 June).https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB921735188918701336 As it took off, the Boeing 747-400 entered fog at the end of runway 28R. After lifting off, the crew experienced a \\"loud thumping noise\\" accompanied by vibration just after the aircraft's landing gear had retracted. Search for Report Number (ACN) 406810. The first officer was handling the takeoff under the captain's supervision, and since the noise occurred just after the landing gear had been retracted, at approximately above ground level, the first officer initially believed one of the tires had failed. At the same time, the exhaust gas temperature of the #3 engine (the inboard engine on the starboard wing) rose to 750 ¬∞C, exceeding the takeoff limit of 650 ¬∞C. With the first officer still flying, the captain retarded the #3 engine throttle to idle, which stopped the temperature rise and aircraft vibration. There were two non- flying relief pilots in the cockpit during takeoff; both noticed the aircraft had lost approximately 40 knots indicated airspeed after the problems with #3 engine and shouted 'airspeed' to the first officer to alert him to the potential stall danger. At that point, the stick shaker system activated and the captain took over control of the aircraft. The captain later stated he held the aircraft level to gain airspeed and avoid a stall, but it had drifted to the right due to the imbalanced thrust and narrowly missed colliding with San Bruno Mountain, which rises to a height of above sea level, excluding the television and radio towers on its summit. This photograph, taken from a blimp over Burlingame, California (foreground), shows the runways at San Francisco airport (in the middle of the picture) and their proximity to San Bruno Mountain (in the background). According to the cockpit voice and flight data recordings, rather than using the rudder, the First Officer had tried to compensate for the right drift by turning the aircraft to the left using ailerons, which control the aircraft‚Äôs longitudinal ‚Äúroll‚Äù axis rather than the vertical ‚Äúyaw‚Äù axis which would have been correct for compensating an asymmetrical thrust condition. The use of ailerons also deployed spoilers on the ‚Äúdown‚Äù wing, which increased the aircraft's net drag and decreased its net lift. A second activation of the stick shaker stall warning resulted. The relief pilots urged the first officer to enter a shallow dive to gain airspeed and avoid a stall, but this soon brought the aircraft close to San Bruno Mountain, and the ground proximity warning alerted the relief pilots and first officer to pull up to avoid striking the hill. By later accounts, the aircraft narrowly cleared San Bruno Mountain by only . The aircraft had approached San Bruno Mountain so closely that air traffic control radars briefly stopped detecting the aircraft. An air traffic controller in the San Francisco tower was conversing with one of her colleagues and said, \\"... Is United 863 still ... oh there he is, he scared me, we lost radar [...]\\" In total, the aircraft had disappeared from radar for approximately 15 seconds. Residents in houses along the flight path, in South San Francisco, Daly City, and San Francisco, called into the airport to complain about the noise and voice their fears the aircraft was about to crash. After the near-collision, UA863 was vectored out to sea to dump fuel to reduce weight and return to San Francisco for an overweight landing. During the climbout, the first officer stated he had noted the aircraft was handling sluggishly and was slow to climb, which he instinctively responded to by \\"[pulling] the nose up just a bit more to climb away from the ground.\\" The first officer had limited experience, having made only one takeoff and landing in a 747 during the year preceding the occurrence. Aftermath United instituted mandatory pilot training and rules, including mandating the use of the rudder in the event of an engine failure upon takeoff. All 9,500 of United's pilots were shown a recreation of the occurrence, filmed in one of United's simulators. As a compromise, pilots were required to make at least three takeoffs and landings in a 90-day period, of which at least one had to be in an actual aircraft. Aviation media consultant Barry Schiff noted the incident, in an article decrying the lack of basic stick-and-rudder skills, especially among pilots who had never flown a light aircraft.

Before inventing the Trapizzino, Stefano worked as a flight attendant for 15 years before returning to Rome to pursue his passion for pizza. Biography Early life Stefano was born in Testaccio, a district in the South of Rome, to parents in the restaurant business. He first encountered the world of pizza in 1992, when he became a delivery driver for a local bakery. Stefano learned to prepare pizza dough from the baker he was working for and, later, enrolled in a pizza-making course. For the next 15 years, Stefano worked as a flight attendant for an Italian airline. Tonda In 2005, Stefano opened his first restaurant, Sforno, in Rome's Cinecitta district. Stefano created a unique dough that was light, flavorful, and crispy. He experimented with different pizzas and created new versions, such as a cacio e pepe pizza. 00100 (Later Trapizzino) In 2008, Stefano opened 00100 in Rome's Testaccio district. After studying street food since the opening of Sforno in 2005, Stefano took inspiration from sandwiches made from pizza dough and decided to combine the simplicity of plain pizza with some of Rome's most traditional dishes to bring together the best characteristics of both elements. Stefano called this combination a Trapizzino and it became the cornerstone dish at 00100. The word Trapizzino is a combination of tramezzino (sandwich) and pizza. Stefano renamed 00100 after his creation after it became popular. Trapizzino NYC Encouraged by the Trapizzino's success in Rome, Stefano partnered with long- time friend and restaurateur Paul Pansera to bring the Trapizzino to the United States in 2017. Trapizzino NYC opened its doors late February, 2017. Philosophical views In an interview with Katie Parla, a Roman food blogger, Stefano stated that his greatest inspiration is food that is made with genuine love. Stefano tries to cook food with the same love a mother would have cooking for their child. Stefano believes that traditional Roman cuisine is becoming an exotic food to the younger generations of Romans.

She is known for her imaginative world-building and character-driven stories.  Career  Chambers worked in theater management and as a freelance writer before self publishing her first novel, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, in 2014 after successfully raising funds on Kickstarter. The novel received critical acclaim and a Kitschies nomination, becoming the first self-published novel to do so. This prompted the novel to be picked up and re-published by Hodder & Stoughton and Harper Voyager. The novel was the first book in the Wayfarer series, which so far includes two sequels, A Closed and Common Orbit, in 2016 and Record of a Spaceborn Few, in 2018. The series won the 2019 Hugo Award for Best Series. She published a novella, To Be Taught, if Fortunate, in August 2019, with a story un-connected to the Wayfarers books. In July 2018 it was announced that she signed a two-book deal with Tor Books, with the first book, A Psalm for the Wild-Built, due to be published in May 2021.  Style and themes  Her Wayfarers series novels take place in a fictional universe, governed by the Galactic Commons to which humans are relative newcomers. She has been lauded for the strong world-building in the series, including multiple unique alien races. She has been noted for the complex and likeable characters who drive the story. Her work has been alternatively criticized and praised for the deliberate, character-driven pacing and lack of the propulsive plots typical of other space opera novels.

These properties are listed on the Foundation‚Äôs Register of Resources Worthy of Preservation \\"Historic Santa Fe Foundation Register of Properties Worthy of Preservation\\" and many display the Historic Santa Fe Foundation bronze plaque. Many of the properties listed on the Foundation's Register of Resources Worthy of Preservation display this bronze plaque, as is shown here for the First Ward School. The Historic Santa Fe Foundation sponsors regular lectures, exhibits, workshops, events, and tours of historic properties. The Foundation also administers the Faith and John Gaw Meem Preservation Trades Internship, a 10-week program that permits a qualified student working in architecture, planning, design, or a similar field to gain hands-on experience in the theory and practice of preservation by working with foundation board members and staff Preservation Employment Opportunities, Preservation Directory.com . Each year, the Foundation recognizes contributions to historic preservation by local residents, businesses, and building trades professionals through its Architectural Stewardship Award. In addition, the Foundation has an artist-in-residence program focusing on the heritage of the Santa Fe area. As of 2018, the Foundation maintains preservation easements on nine properties and maintains a register of 95 homes, buildings, structures, and places that are considered worthy of preservation. History The Old Santa Fe Association, an advocacy organization for improved preservation policies, sponsored the formation of the Historic Santa Fe Foundation in 1961.\\"80 Years of Commitment to the Community\\". Old Santa Fe Association, El Presidio (Fall 2006:7). The inaugural members consisted of Santa Fe artists, writers, doctors, business owners, and neighbors. John Gaw Meem, a New Mexico architect, was elected the First Honorary Director of the Board of Directors. The catalyst for this new preservation organization was the City of Santa Fe‚Äôs proposal to demolish the historic Simon Nusbaum House in 1960. A Matter of Style, Santa Fe New Mexican, October 27, 2007 With the help of John Gaw Meem, $20,000 was raised to try to purchase the building. Although the Nusbaum house was replaced with an 85-car parking lot, the money that had been raised to protect it was used to begin the Foundation. Protection The Historic Santa Fe Foundation's preservation easement \\"Historic Santa Fe Foundation easements\\" [http://www.historicsantafe.org/easements/} } program seeks to permanently protect historic buildings and sites. The easement is a voluntary form of legal agreement between the Foundation and the property owner that describes the preservation objective of the easement and the property owner‚Äôs rights and obligations to follow those restrictions when making alterations to the property. The easement agreement remains in force when the property changes ownership, thus protecting the property well into the future The Historic Santa Fe Foundation endeavors to protect Santa Fe‚Äôs historic architectural and cultural integrity through scholarly research and documentation. HSFF archives include property files (narrative histories, newspaper articles, correspondence, etc.), photographs, and documentation relating to early and current preservation efforts. In addition to maintaining archives, the Foundation staff offers advice to those researching Santa Fe‚Äôs historic properties. Publications The Historic Santa Fe Foundation produces a tri- annual newsletter of essays, book reviews, and historical site descriptions. It also publishes a monthly e-zine, Historic Santa Fe, monthly ezine of the Historic Santa Fe Foundation and occasional books, including Old Santa Fe Today Archives The Historic Santa Fe Foundation has archives on about 100 historic properties in the Santa Fe region. The archives have historical information on ownership, architectural modifications, and more. Most properties are now in an electronic database and the electronic cataloging of files continues. The Faith and John Gaw Meem Preservation Trades Internship The Faith and John Gaw Meem Preservation Trades Internship, established in 2005, provides emerging students of preservation with an opportunity to engage in hands-on conservation of historic adobe buildings, working under the mentorship of Foundation Board members and staff. The 10-week summer program houses the intern, reimburses the intern at the rate of Santa Fe's Living Wage, and allows the intern to participate in all Foundation activities. Training and education Much of the preservation work performed by the Foundation is presented in workshops on the use of traditional techniques and material, open to the public. These workshops help to train new generations of preservation craftspeople as well as providing stewardship information for owners of other historic properties. Past workshops have covered tree ring dating (a useful tool in dating structures), earthen plasters, natural lime finishes, historic window restoration and maintenance of historic gardens. The monthly Salon El Zaguan lectures offer speakers on diverse topics of interest to Foundation members and the public. Architectural Stewardship Award Each year, during America's National Preservation Month, the Foundation presents an Architectural Stewardship Award to an individual or organization that has demonstrated outstanding dedication to the care and preservation of one or more of Santa Fe's prominent historic buildings. In recent years, the award has gone to the Scottish Rite Masonic Center (1911-12); La Fonda Hotel on the Plaza (1920); the Friends (Quaker) Meeting House (circa 1920), former studio of Olive Rush; the Gustave Baumann House (1923); and the San Miguel Chapel (built prior to 1628). The purpose of the award is to recognize outstanding stewardship and to encourage similar practices among owners of historic properties. The award is presented at Santa Fe's annual Heritage Preservation Awards ceremony, co-sponsored by the City's Historic Preservation Division, The Old Santa Fe Association, and the Historic Santa Fe Foundation.

Her grandfather was Job Otis, who with his wife Deborah was a leader of the Otisites, and whose house may still be seen today in Sherwood.See also: Amy studied at Cornell University and the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, and was a graduate of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. She also studied at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris. For some years she was active as a portraitist in Philadelphia, where she also taught art at Miss Capen's School for Girls from 1911 to 1914. In that year she began work a professor at Wheaton College in Massachusetts, ultimately becoming the head of the art department. Otis retired from Wheaton in 1932. She designed the seal for the school's Alumnae Association while she was there. After leaving Wheaton she taught for a time at Wells College, where she was at one point acting head of the Department of Art.Auburn Citizen Advertiser of February 27, 1933 During her career Otis exhibited work throughout the United States.

Six of the attacks left 12 people dead (mostly civilians) and around 45 people injured.Anne Cadwallader ‚Äì Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland pp.14 There was also an attack in a small village in County Down called Killyleagh. There were five attacks in and around Belfast which left people dead. A bomb which exploded in Coleraine left four UVF Volunteers dead. There were also several other smaller bombs planted around Northern Ireland (16 in total) but other than causing damage they didn't kill or injure anyone. Background There was a rise in sectarian killings during the Provisional IRA truce with the British Army, which began in February 1975 and officially lasted until February 1976. Loyalists, fearing they were about to be forsaken by the British government and forced into a united Ireland,Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.142 increased their attacks on Irish Catholics/Irish nationalists. Loyalists killed 120 Catholics in 1975, the vast majority civilians.Taylor, Peter. Brits: The War Against the IRA. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001. p.182 They hoped to force the IRA to retaliate and thus end the truce. Some IRA units concentrated on tackling the loyalists. The fall-off of regular operations had caused unruliness within the IRA and some members, with or without permission from higher up, engaged in tit-for- tat killings. The attacks In the first attack of the day on Casey's Bottling Plant in Belfast; four employees were shot and killed in the attack, sisters Frances Donnelly (age 35), Marie McGrattan (47) and Gerard Grogan (18) all died that day, with a fourth, Thomas Osborne (18), dying of his wounds three weeks later.Anne Cadwallader ‚Äì Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland pp.127 The UVF group, which was alleged to have been led by Shankill Butchers leader Lenny Murphy, had entered the premises by pretending to have an order to be filled before launching the attack. Murphy personally shot all except Donnelly who was killed by his accomplice William Green. The two sisters were forced to kneel on the ground and were shot in the back of the head. In the next attack Thomas Murphy (29), a Catholic photographer from Belfast, was killed in a booby-trap bomb and gun attack, when two UVF gunmen entered his premises on Carlisle Circus (close to both the loyalist Shankill Road and republican New Lodge areas of Belfast) and shot him in the chest, before planting a duffel bag bomb in his shop. The resulting explosion injured several people including a female passer-by who lost her leg. Next the UVF carried out a gun and bomb attack on McKenna's Bar near Crumlin in County Antrim which killed a Catholic civilian John Stewart (35) and injured scores of people. In Killyleagh, County Down, a no-warning bomb exploded outside a Catholic-owned bar, The Anchor Inn. Irene Nicholson (37), a Protestant woman, was killed as she was passing by while the attack was being carried out. Three UVF members were later arrested for this attack in Bangor and one of them claimed the attack was \\"a small one to scare them\\".Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1: The British Army in Northern Ireland, by Ken Wharton Next Ronald Winters (26), a Protestant civilian, was shot dead by the UVF in his parents' house on London Road, Belfast. Later at night four UVF Volunteers were killed in Coleraine when the bomb they were transporting exploded prematurely. Aftermath The next day on 3 October the UVF was once again made a proscribed terrorist organisation. Northern Ireland Secretary Merlyn Rees had unbanned the UVF in May 1974 (the same day the ban on Sinn F√©in was lifted, a move never extended to the IRA). Despite this the UVF were still able to kill Catholic civilians at will for the rest of 1975 and for most of 1976 also.

Born into slavery and of mixed race, during the American Civil War he left a position as steward on a Confederate steamboat to move to New Orleans, which had been taken over by Union troops. There he helped organize the First Louisiana Volunteer Native Guards, becoming captain of Company K and serving until 1864. After the war he became politically active in the Republican Party during the Reconstruction era, where he was an ally of several other leading men of color in the city and state. This was an especially violent time in Louisiana and New Orleans politics, but Lewis survived for decades as a political leader. He initially worked for the Freedmen's Bureau, where he was an agent to raise money and establish schools for freed slaves. He was appointed as a federal custom's inspector for a short period, the first man of African descent to gain a federal civil position in the state. He was recalled for political reasons. Lewis entered the New Orleans Metropolitan Police force, but left in 1872 after more political machinations. He emerged from the immediate postwar period as a leader in the New Orleans Republican Party . For much of the 1870s, 1880s, 1890s, and 1900s, he held state and federal-level Republican-appointee government positions, usually in the United States Treasury Department. He also served for years under Republican administrations as the surveyor-general of Louisiana and Mississippi. He was a Freemason and a leader in the Grand Army of the Republic, a civil war veterans organization.

All three became political leaders after the Civil War.Ingham and Feldman (1994), p135Lewis may have been free by the outset of the Civil War. Historian David C. Rankin lists Lewis as an illiterate free steward in 1860‚Äì61, see: Rankin, David C. \\"The Origins of Black Leadership in New Orleans During Reconstruction,\\" The Journal of Southern History 40, no. 3 (1974): 417‚Äì440. p438 Civil War At the beginning of the Civil War, Lewis served as a steward on the CSS De Soto and was present at the fighting at the Battle of Belmont in November 1861 and the Battle of Island Number Ten and New Madrid in February, March, and April 1862. Lewis believed the war was a chance to fight for the freedom of all blacks. He fled through danger to New Orleans shortly after its capture by Union Forces under David Farragut and Benjamin Butler in late April and early May 1862, to join Union forces. In New Orleans, Lewis resolved to become a soldier. Together with other blacks, he asked for permission to raise a regiment of colored troops. Lewis raised two companies of colored infantry and was mustered into the First Louisiana Volunteer Native Guards as captain of one of these, Company K. While a minority of the members had been free men of color before the war, the majority of troops were slaves newly freed by their escape from plantations and joining Union lines. Lewis resigned his commission after the Red River Campaign led by Nathaniel Banks in 1864. Lewis later wrote that he resigned because he was ordered to appear before a Board of Examiners that would rule on his ability to continue as captain, and a member of the board told him that no black officers would be passed. In November 1864, Lewis was authorized to recruit another company of infantry to join the 1st United States Colored Infantry. He offered to do so if allowed to appear before a Board of Examiners and be commissioned as an officer.Berlin, Ira, ed. Freedom: A Documentary History of Emancipation 1861‚Äì1867: Series 11: The Black Military Experience. Cambridge University Press, 1982. p332-334 In 1864 Lewis married Josephine Joubert of New Orleans, a free woman of color whose family had been slaveholders. For many years the couple lived in a fine house on Canal Street across from Straight University. Reconstruction era Lewis was at various times an ally and an opponent of Louisiana Republican leader, Henry Clay Warmouth (pictured). After the war, Lewis returned to New Orleans, where he worked as a permit and custom-house broker until the opening of ocean trade and the start of the Reconstruction Era. He was appointed as traveling agent for the educational department of the Freedmen's Bureau and worked to establish schools for freed slaves throughout Louisiana. He was frequently threatened during his work by ex-Confederates who opposed his efforts. At one point he was captured in North Louisiana and risked death but was rescued by the intervention of a group of fellow Freemasons. He may have been one of the injured in the 1866 New Orleans riot at the Mechanics Institute, when whites rioted against a parade of blacks celebrating suffrage.United States. Congress. House. Select Committee on the New Orleans Riots, Thomas Dawes Eliot, Samuel Shellabarger, Benjamin Markley Boyer. Report of the Select Committee on the New Orleans Riots. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1867, p13 When the Freedmen's Bureau closed, Lewis was appointed by Republican Governor William P. Kellogg as the United States inspector of customs for Louisiana, making him the first black man to have a civil position in the Federal service in Louisiana. In 1869, Lewis refused to support Seymour and Blair's presidential ticket, and as a result, Perry Fuller removed him from the position. Lewis became sergeant of the Metropolitan Police in New Orleans. He was successful in this position and was promoted to captain of the police. In 1870, Governor Henry Clay Warmouth appointed Lewis as colonel of the Second Regiment of the State Militia. That year Lewis was also elected to a two-year term as administer of police. Support for Warmouth among black Louisiana Republicans flagged, and opposition to Warmouth coalesced in what was called the Custom House Ring. It was headquartered at the U. S. Custom House and was led by federal appointees, including Lewis, Stephen B. Packard, a US Marshal; and James F. Casey, Collector of the Port of New Orleans and brother-in-law to President Ulysses S. Grant. The Custom House Ring supported the gubernatorial bid of Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives George W. Carter, and Carter and Warmouth violently clashed in late 1871 and early 1872. James Longstreet was the head of the Louisiana state militia, and was called to defend the statehouse from an attempt by Carter and the Ring to take over the government. Lewis did not respond to Longstreet's call-up of the militia. Members of his unit were reorganized under more politically reliable officers and did play a role in supporting Warmouth.Hogue, James Keith.

LSU Press, 2006. p76‚Äì83 Republican appointee In 1872, at the state Republican Party convention, Lewis was nominated for Congress and made chairman of the Louisiana delegation to the 1872 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. When he returned to New Orleans, party divisions threatened unity. Lewis declined his congressional nomination in favor of P. B. S. Pinchback. He campaigned for William P. Kellogg for governor and was nominated and elected as administrator of public improvements in New Orleans. His opponents in that race were former Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard and Major E. A. Burke. Lewis was well appreciated as a civil servant and noted for his economic efficiency.[No Headline], The Donaldsonville Chief (Donaldsonville, Louisiana) November 2, 1872, page 2.

In 1876 he campaigned with then-Governor Packard and was elected by the state legislature to the United States Senate. But he did not take his seat as the state government was taken over by Democrats, and Lewis refused to press his claim. In 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Lewis as naval officer of the port at New Orleans, and he held that position until 1880. In December 1879, Lewis attempted to resolve a political feud between fellow Republicans Emile Detiege and Ernest and Onezyphore Delahoussaye. The four men met in Lewis' office in the Custom House and peace had seemingly been achieved. However, shortly later, Detiege shot and killed the two Delahoussaye brothers.\\"A Political Feud,\\" The Times-Picayune (New Orleans, Louisiana) December 4, 1879, page 1.

He continued to serve as surveyor general during the administrations of William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft, from 1897 to 1913. During this period, Louisiana was dominated by white conservative Democrats, and the legislature passed a new constitution that effectively disenfranchised Lewis and most African Americans. But Lewis was appointed deputy collector of customs and immigration inspector by President Benjamin Harrison in the early 1890s.\\"Col Jas Lewis, Race Leader, Dead in N.

Lewis was one of the signatories of a letter to the Italian community, urging people to inform the committee about the suspects, and threatening extrajudicial action. He was the only man of color on the committee. Nineteen men were arrested. Ultimately eleven Italians were lynched on March 14, 1891 by a mob of 10,000 that stormed the prison where the suspects were held. Some of the victims had already been acquitted at trial and others had not yet been tried. In the 1890s and early 1900s, Lewis and Walter L. Cohen were the most important political allies in Louisiana of Booker T. Washington, president of Tuskegee Institute and a proponent of moderation in race issues.

Work  Weinberger is most known for his work on identifying genetic factors and biochemical mechanisms in mental illness, and promoting research in these areas to further explain causes behind disorders such as schizophrenia. He is an expert in the neurobiological mechanisms of genetic risk for developmental brain disorders, such as the gene that codes for catecho-O-methyltransferase (COMT), the enzyme that breaks down the chemical messenger dopamine. Weinberger discovered that a tiny variation in this gene slightly increases risk for schizophrenia, a discovery which Science Magazine ranked as the second most important scientific breakthrough of 2003. In a later paper, he analyzed the activity of the gene Neuregulin-1 in a large collection of brain samples from schizophrenic patients and found that the regulation of the gene contributes to schizophrenia.Nicholas Wade \\"Schizophrenia as Misstep by Giant Gene\\" New York Times, 18 April 2006. In a review in Neuron, Weinberger wrote that individuals of African ancestry must be included in research for brain illnesses.

The film follows a man whose occupation is breaking up girls' relationships for their deploring parents, and at the same time trying to win over a girl he had a crush on in grade school. The film premiered at Arclight Cinema Dome, Los Angeles, California on October 4, 2016, and was released in selected theaters on October 7. The film was released for digital download on December 6. This film features the only motion picture performance by the American musician Christina Grimmie, who was murdered four months prior to its release. Plot The film opens with Ethan Cooper, a clerk at a computer repair shop, retelling a story to his roommate Sam about his long-lasting infatuation with a girl he knew in primary school. One day, while visiting his sister Lexy, a florist, Ethan gets an offer from Mrs. Taylor to get rid of her daughter Veronica's boyfriend in exchange for money. He succeeds but accidentally causes Veronica to become infatuated with him. Mrs. Taylor recommends Ethan to other disapproving parents, thus making him a match-breaker and making his \\"business\\" prosperous. Sometime later, he gets a yet another offer from a dissatisfied parent. Ethan meets her at a jazz club, where she apparently sings at nights. It turns out that the daughter is actually Emily Atkins, the same girl whom Ethan was gushing about to his roommate, Sam. Ethan decides to meet up with her again, this time at an art gallery, where Emily works. Meanwhile, a puerile rich young man named Mitchell becomes interested in a waitress named Tricia. Unfortunately, his parents do not approve of his new-found love interest and they hire Ethan to dismantle the couple. Ethan goes on a double date with the couple, bringing Lexy along to act as his girlfriend. They try to make Mitchell and Tricia dislike each other but are unsuccessful. Sometime after, Emily invites Ethan to a restaurant where Ethan learns Emily's apparent displeasure with her boyfriend. Later, Ethan gets a surprise visit from Emily's mother, from whom he learns that Emily has broken up with her boyfriend on her own. Her mother offers Ethan a reward, but he declines. Ethan and Emily decide to hang out. Emily learns that Ethan had and still has a crush on her. Also, Ethan learns that Emily is not as flawless as he made her out to be. Despite her flaws, Ethan kisses Emily, but Emily disapproves of the kiss. Emily gets a call from a friend who is in need of help and asks Ethan to come. It turns out that Emily is close friends with Tricia. Ethan learns that Tricia and Mitchell broke up. Annoyed with Veronica's affection with him, Ethan decides to tell her that he has no interest in her. Sometime later, at a formal party, Emily notices a check written by her mother for Ethan in her mother's handbag. Ethan rushes over to the party as Sam texts him to let him know that someone is trying to seduce Emily. When he arrives, Emily, who is infuriated, confronts Ethan about the check. Ethan notices that Veronica has followed him. Engulfed with emotional trauma, Veronica exposes Ethan to be a match-breaker in front of a crowd, as she has stalked him since they first met. The next day, Emily's mother tells Emily that Ethan refused to take the check for the assumed dismantlement of the couple. Meanwhile, overwhelmed with guilt, Ethan gets Mitchell back together with Tricia, and offers Mitchell's father, a record producer, to visit the jazz club tonight, where Emily will be performing. Later, Tricia informs Emily that Ethan helped Mitchell to win Tricia over again. Six months later, Tricia and Mitchell have gotten engaged, and Ethan has written a relationship book and started a romantic relationship with Emily.

Richard Charitable Foundation is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charitable foundation that works to advance the values of inclusion, kindness, justice and peace. The Foundation invests in community programs that broaden horizons for young people and encourage them to celebrate diversity and engage in positive civic action. On April 15, 2013, eight-year-old Martin Richard was one of three people killed while hundreds of others were injured when two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line. A photo of Martin holding a handmade sign spread across the Internet in the weeks that followed; the sign read ‚ÄúNo More Hurting People, Peace.‚Äù Martin‚Äôs earnest commitment to peace became the impetus for the Martin Richard Foundation, founded by parents Denise and Bill in January 2014. Since 2014, the foundation has raised money through its charity team at the annual Boston Marathon, Chicago Marathon, New York City Marathon, and Falmouth Road Race. Team MR8, named after Martin Richard's initials and his favorite sports number, is composed of volunteer runners, including runners who may not usually qualify to run in the race due to their time scores. The team members raise money for the foundation, which in turn invests in projects such as the Challenger Sports program, its Bridge Builder Campaign, and Martin's Park, an inclusive, climate-resilient space on the Smith Family Waterfront, the first of its kind in Boston and a lasting symbol of Martin Richard‚Äôs kind, playful, welcoming spirit. Co-founded with the Boston Bruins Foundation and DMSE Sports, the Foundation's Signature Event is the MR8K, a 5-mile (8K) race open to runners, walkers, para-athletes and families of all ages and abilities. Each year, proceeds and optional fundraising efforts benefit a new community campaign. Martin's Park Martin's Park, which opened in 2019, is located in the Seaport District adjacent to the Boston Children's Museum. Construction began in June 2017, following a $13 million investment from the Martin Richard Foundation. The park overlooks Fort Point Channel and features a children's playground, a performance space, and an upgraded Harborwalk, as well as a garden and water park.

It is an eclipsing binary consisting of a Wolf-Rayet star and a luminous companion of unknown spectral type. The primary is one of the most luminous stars known. The spectrum of WR 12 is dominated by the broad emission lines of the primary Wolf-Rayet star. The lowest ionisation nitrogen emission lines are strongest, with NV lines being very weak. The HeI lines are stronger than the HeII lines. Unusually the hydrogen emission is stronger still, leading to a WN8h spectral class. CIV emission is almost undetectable. It has been suggested that the companion is a class O star, but its lines cannot be seen in the spectrum. The system produces eclipses which dim the brightness of the star by 0.12 magnitudes every 24 days. The stars are detached and so it is classified as an Algol-type eclipsing binary. The inclination of the orbit has been estimated at 78.8¬∞ but a full orbital solution is not available because the secondary cannot be directly detected.

They are fairly stable and therefore persistent in the environment. Bioremediation of PCBs is the use of microorganisms to degrade PCBs from contaminated sites, which can be either a soil or aqueous environment. It is a process relying on multiple microorganisms' co-metabolism. Anaerobic microorganisms dechlorinate PCBs first, and other microorganisms that are capable of doing BH pathway can break down the dechlorinated PCBs to usable intermediates like acyl-CoA or carbon dioxide. If no BH pathway-caple microorganisms are present, dechlorinated PCBs can be mineralized with help of fungi and plants. However, there are multiple limiting factors for this co- metabolism.  Overview   PCBs  254x254px Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are various biphenyl based artificial products that are widely used as a dielectric fluid, industrial coolant, and lubricants in the 1960s and 1970s. There is no evidence its synthesis occurs naturally. They are classified as persistent organic pollutants. PCBs share the basic chemical structure of biphenyl and one or more of the hydrogen atoms on the aromatic rings are replaced by chlorine atoms. PCBs is in viscous liquid form at normal temperature and has a poor solubility in water. The aromatic hydrocarbon structure gives PCBs relatively high molecular stability. The chlorine substitution further reinforces its insolubility and chemical stability. Hence, the degradation of PCBs in the natural environment is very slow, which can range from 3 to 37 years depending on the number of chloride substitutions and their positions.  Bioremediation  Bioremediation is a waste removal method that uses microorganisms to degrade or remove wastes like organic waste and heavy metal from contaminated sites including both soil and water. The advantages of bioremediation are that it is environment-friendly, inexpensive and can remove multiple wastes simultaneously comparing with traditional chemical and physical processes.  Degradation Process  Various microorganisms are involved in a two-stage process of degradation of PCBs, which happens in aerobic and anaerobic environments. Degrading PCBs is similar to the degradation of biphenyl. However, the chlorines on PCBs prevent them from being utilized as a substrate of biphenyl degradation. Due to high chemical stability, PCBs cannot be used as energy sources. However, due to the chlorination, PCBs can be used as electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration to store energy, which is also the first stage of the degradation pathway, reductive dechlorination. Once the PCBs are dechlorinated to a certain degree, usually lower than five chlorines presenting in the structure and one aromatic ring has no chlorine, they can undergo the biphenyl degradation pathway (BP pathway) to be degraded to accessible carbon or CO2 in the aerobic environment. BP pathway is a pathway that utilizes series of enzymes (BphA, B, C, D, E, F, G) to convert biphenyl to TCA cycle intermediates (pyruvate and Acyl-CoA) and benzoate. However, there are few microorganisms that can dechlorinate substrate under natural conditions. Even with selective media, the accumulation of PCB dechlorinating microorganisms is still slow, which is one reason for the slow degradation rate. As a result, PCBs usually go through a co-metabolism pathway that involving different microorganism species. Generally speaking, there are four steps in this process: # In order for PCBs to enter the cell, they firstly need to be solubilized. # PCBs are dechlorinated by anaerobic bacteria, then transport the metabolites to aerobic bacteria or fungi through a biofilm. # The presence of PCBs metabolites triggers the expression of enzymes in BP pathway. # PCBs are broken down to Acetyl-CoA and then can be utilized or carbon dioxide. The Figure below shows the complete degradation pathway. 495x495px  Limiting Factors   PCBs entering the cells  PCBs have low water solubility, so they adhere tightly to soil and cannot be easily accessed by bacteria. Especially, if the contaminations site has been exposed to PCBs for long period, PCBs can be integrated into soil or sediment matrices, then further decrease their bioavailability. Some surfactants can help solubilize but cannot increase the rate of PCBs degrading. However, if PCBs are linked to surfactants tightly too, then this process cannot promote the absorption of PCBs and even lower it. Also, many surfactants have been proven to be toxic to cells and the high cost of surfactants is another issues.  PCBs properties  PCBs are toxic to bacterial communities above 1000 mg/kg. However, if the concentration is too low (lower than 50 mg/kg), the degradation slows down significantly, for there is not enough material to stimulate the expression of required genes and support the growth of competent microorganisms. PCBs includes various different compounds with slightly different structures. Those slight differences make big differences in metabolic rate. Generally speaking, the more chlorines in a PCB molecule, the harder for it to be degraded. In particular, microorganisms cannot degrade di- and tetra-ortho substituted well. It is possible that those structures prevent enzymes from accessing reaction sites.  Soil and sediment characteristics  First, the soil and sediment structures will determine how tightly PCBs are adhered to them and affect the absorption of PCBs into cells. The PCBs‚Äô availability suffers from increasing organic carbon and clay content, for they promote the absorption of PCBs into soil or sediment matrices. Second, the soil contains necessary nutrition for the growth of microbes and anaerobic and aerobic environments. Finally, the local microbial population has significant impacts on the rate of degradation of PCBs, which varies based on the microbial strains and their activities. Then, if there is no history of exposure to PCBs, it may take months for microbes to activates their ability to dechlorinate PCBs and break them down.  Gene expression and bottleneck effect of metabolites  PCBs or biphenyl cannot provide energy for microbes, so they are primary energy and carbon sources. As stated before it takes months sometimes for microorganisms to activate their gene for dichlorine after the first exposure to PCBs. It has been proposed to use analogs to promote the activation of genes. However, even after the metabolic pathway is activated, the intermediates of the pathway create a bottleneck effect due to their toxicity. Also, there is the possibility that BP pathway leads to protoanemonin which is a dead-end metabolite that cannot be utilized by cells. Due to the high energy cost of this pathway, if no preferred energy source present in the system, cells will not activate this pathway.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Rudolf Ising. The short was released on December 10, 1932. Plot An old, bespectacled gentleman, an open volume in his hands, sits in his library, in a rocking chair, in his stocking feet, comfortably before a warm fire. A clock above the mantle strikes (the face apparently reading about five, but the number of rings indicating eight) and the gentleman, rising, sets the open book down on his seat; yawning and stretching, he makes his way across the room, a well-used, lit taper in his hand, which he sets on a table near the threshold, extinguishing the flame with a great breath as he exits. We cut back to the rocker and the open book, Alice in Wonderland, out of which who should emerge but Alice herself! Up leaps the tiny girl to the arm of the chair, up she leaps to a nearby table, the which she runs across until she meets a radio, whose great dial she adjusts with some effort. The song of the title comes through, our little heroine swaying and scatting her way through it. Merrily she rolls along, skipping and sliding past some untidily shelved volumes, out of one of which, Robinson Crusoe, emerges some accompaniment, likely Robinson himself and Friday. Meanwhile, Rip Van Winkle's book snores away; the cover is pushed away by Rip, apparently awakened by and much enjoying the music. Alice trots along, coming across The Three Musketeers, whose cover she pries open: \\"All for one and one for all,\\" cry Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, raising their rapiers as they segue into their own scatting- routine. Cut to Robinson, Friday, Napoleon, and Omar Khayyam, who stand amongst the books bobbing about happily to the tune. There is a universal burst of applause as the musketeers conclude their number: Henry VIII, surrounded (presumably) by some of his wives, shouts \\"Whoopee!\\" Nearby, Marc Antony crawls out of Antony and Cleopatra, shouting, as if in Julius Caesar, \\"Friends, Romans, countrymen...lend your ears to that dear old maestro!\\" The camera pans to a portly Emperor Nero, who stands before a book containing an image of the Great Fire of Rome and holds his iconic, anachronistic fiddle. He plays an exotic tune: Cleopatra comes dancing out of her book, looking like an Egyptian tomb-painting. Alice skips over to Uncle Tom's Cabin, summoning its title character: Uncle Tom sings Stephen Foster's Old Black Joe as well as \\"I've Got the South in my Soul,\\" the other characters his chorus (Alice occasionally interjecting, \\"O Lord!\\") Snarling, Mr. Hyde peeps out from his book, meaning trouble as he clutches one of the skull-shaped book-ends that contain his volume: he snatches Alice as the song concludes; on a high shelf, Tarzan takes notice, crying valorously as he swings down to the table by way of a couple of pull switches. The manly figure stands in Hyde's way, prompting the cad to turn and run: Robinson and Friday snatch up a nearby fountain pen as Hyde comes close and they spray his devilish face full of black ink. In an effort to clean himself, Hyde ejects Alice only to find, once he can see again, that two Roman soldiers are advancing towards him with a lit pipe; as they gain on their adversary, one of the soldiers blows into the tail of pipe, scalding Hyde's bottom with a breath of fire. Robin Hood loads his tiny bow with a match whose tip, as Robin pulls back his string, rubs against the coarse side of its box, igniting as it hurtles towards the villain; Hyde runs away in a panic as projectile after projectile thus flies at him: but, again, the fiend has nowhere to run, for, in the other direction, the musketeers are loading steel pen-points into a pencil sharpener, winding the sharpener's crank in order to fire the nibs as though bullets from a gatling. Overwhelmed, Hyde leaps into a small hinged box nearby and, as he cowers there, four of the characters shut the lid and carry the box away in the fashion of pall-bearers; a dirge plays as they drop the ersatz coffin from the edge of the table into a waste-paper basket at its foot. The ensemble cheers!

He had been promoted to first lieutenant by the time of the sieges of Kaiserswerth and Venlo. From 1702 he became general adjutant of Dubislav Gneomar von Natzmer. With Natzmer's help, Platen became a deputy in the Gensdarmes' regiment. In 1703 he was involved in the siege of Bonn. He was captured at the Battle of H√∂chst√§dt (1704), when the French army under Claude Louis Hector de Villars defeated the imperial armies; he was soon exchanged. In 1705 Platen fought on the Upper Rhine and in 1706 on the Lower Rhine. In 1707 he was promoted to major, and fought the following year in the Battle of Oudenaarde. He participated in the conquests of Lille and Ghent as well as in Mons. In 1709 he fought in the decisive Battle of Malplaquet. There, he impressed Frederick William, then the Prussian crown prince, who introduced him to the king and rewarded him with estates at Putzermin and half of Fritzow. Platen fought in 1710 at Douay, Bethune and Aire and, in 1711, at Bouchain. He remained in Holland until the Peace of Utrecht.

Life Eustace was a younger son of Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut. His older brothers Baldwin I (r. 1204‚Äì1205) and Henry (r. 1205‚Äì16) participated in the Fourth Crusade and were the first two emperors of the Latin Empire of Constantinople. Eustace himself probably did not participate in the Crusade, and only appears among the senior noblemen of the Latin Empire in 1206. He was evidently among those nobles from Flanders and northern France who were invited to come to the Latin Empire by his brothers. In 1208 he was sent to command a garrison in the Rhodope Mountains, belonging to the autonomous prince Alexius Slav. In summer 1209, Henry quelled a revolt of the Lombard barons of the Kingdom of Thessalonica, and brought the realm under his effective control by appointing Eustace (along with Berthold of Katzenelnbogen) as his de facto viceroy there. The Greek ruler of Epirus, Michael I Komnenos Doukas, sent envoys to propose an alliance. Henry distrusted Michael's sincerity, but sent an embassy to Epirus with his terms, which amounted to Michael declaring himself a vassal of the Latin Empire. As confirmation of the pact, Eustace married a daughter of Michael and received a third of his lands as her dowry. Eustace is last mentioned in April 1217 as attending the coronation of the new Latin Emperor, Peter of Courtenay, and his sister, Yolanda of Flanders.

Coll√©, with his former business partner, Howard Gittis, started a speculative real estate development business in the Hamptons. Coll√© has experience as both a carpenter and a designer-builder, and has created homes for celebrities and prominent individuals.  Early life  Jeffrey Coll√© was born in 1952 on Long Island, New York. Coll√©'s grandfather (who immigrated to the U.S. from Belgium in 1913) and his father were both carpenters, making Coll√© a third-generation carpenter. Starting early in life, he worked for his grandfather and father on various construction sites throughout Long Island and New York City.  Education  Coll√© attended a vocational school as an apprentice carpenter in his late teens. He also worked directly with craftsmen across various trades, and he became proficient in several disciplines, including tile work, cabinetry, painting, electrical and plumbing. In 1970, at age 18, Coll√© joined the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, where he became a Journeyman Carpenter after attending a four-year apprenticeship program.  Design-Builder Career  At 24, Coll√© began his career as a professional builder and started his own business, which is now called Estates by Jeffrey Coll√©. His first luxury residential home project was located in Hampton Bays, New York, and he has built his career on being a builder, developer, and investor of luxury homes in the Hamptons.  Partnership  In 1995, Jeffrey Coll√© was discovered by Howard Gittis, an attorney, investor, and longtime adviser to Ronald Perelman and Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo.

Laura Anne Fry (January 22, 1857 ‚Äì 1943) was an American artist who specialized in wood carving, ceramics, and china painting. She worked at both the Rookwood Pottery Company and the Lonhuda Pottery Company as a ceramic painter and teacher, and she received a patent for one of her technical innovations. She headed up the Purdue University Art Department for a quarter of a century, and under her guidance, the department developed a high reputation for its ceramic program. Early life and education Laura Anne Fry was born in White County, Indiana, not far from Lafayette. Both her father, Wiliam Henry Fry, and her grandfather Henry Lindley Fry were artists as well and taught her wood carving. Her family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, so that her father could take up a position teaching at the McMicken School of Design. At the age of 12, she began training at the school herself, and she returned intermittently until the mid 1880s. She initially studied drawing and modeling with Louis Rebisso and later china painting with Maria Eggers and life drawing with Thomas Satterwhite Noble. Fry is thought to have gained most of her ceramics training in New Jersey and in Europe, though the details are lost. She also spent time at the Art Students League in New York in 1886. Art career Fry was an exceptionally talented woodcarver, and one of her earliest public works was a carved panel of lilies that took first prize ($100 in gold) in a competition for designs to decorate the organ screen in Cincinnati Music Hall, which has been called the \\"magnum opus of the wood- carving movement\\" in late 19th century America. For several years, she ran the wood-carving school of the local Chautauqua Assembly. In 1893, Fry received an award for her wood carving at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. She briefly opened her own studio, where she worked in carving, furniture design, and china painting. Unable to make a financial success of it, she closed it and in 1881 took a job at the Rookwood Pottery Company, which had been founded by Maria Longworth Nichols Storer the year before. Fry worked there for seven years, developing forms, decorating pottery, and teaching modeling and ceramic design to students. She was one of the original members of the Cincinnati Pottery Club (founded 1879), a group of women that organized to pursue experiments in pottery and that was influential in the development of the American art pottery movement of the late 19th century. In 1891, Fry was offered a position as professor of industrial art at Purdue University. She left in 1892 to work for Lonhuda Pottery Company in Steubenville, Indiana. Returning to teach at Purdue in 1893, she served as head of the Art Department until her retirement in 1922. Under Fry's leadership, the department developed a high reputation for its ceramics program. Innovations While studying ceramics in Europe, Fry perfected a technique called \\"scratch-blue\\" that was originally developed by Hannah Barlow at the Doulton factory in London. During her years at Rookwood, Fry innovated a new technique for applying underglaze pigments evenly to damp clay surfaces using a mouth-held atomizer. This allowed for subtle blending of colors and became the standard method used at Rookwood for backgrounds. She was awarded a patent on her invention in 1889, but when Rookwood continued using it after she left to work at Lonhuda, she sued to stop them. Judge William Howard Taft ruled against her on the grounds that her technique was merely a new use for an existing tool. Fry died in 1943, and her papers are held by Purdue University.

In January 2017, she was found alive in Walterboro, South Carolina. DNA testing proved that she was not the daughter of Gloria Williams, her abductor. She had been raised under the name Alexis Manigo. Her biological mother in Florida, Shanara Mobley, was awarded $1.5 million after settling a lawsuit against the former University Medical Center. She has since had three other children. Abduction Kamiyah Mobley was born on July 10, 1998, to sixteen-year-old Shanara Mobley. She was abducted eight hours after birth by a woman impersonating a nurse, reportedly dressed in hospital attire, who entered the room, assisted and conversed with the mother, and later walked out of the room with Kamiyah in her arms. Employees initially believed that the woman who kidnapped Kamiyah was a member of the Mobley family. Shanara was interviewed later, pleading for the return of her daughter. The abductor was believed to be between 25 and 35 years old and possibly wore a pair of glasses and a wig. She was dressed in a floral blue smock and green scrub pants. It is known that Gloria Williams, about 33 at the time, later forged documents to create a new identity for Mobley. Williams was in an abusive relationship and had just miscarried a child a week before, which is believed to be her motive for the abduction. Investigation and recovery The news of the kidnapping and her being found made national headlines in 2017. Because there were no photographs taken of Kamiyah before her abduction, a computer-generated composite of her was created to distribute to the media. Distinctive features, such as Mongolian spots and an umbilical hernia, were included in reports. After a series of tips, Mobley was swabbed, and a DNA sample taken from Mobley after she was born was matched to a swab taken from the potential match. After the match was confirmed, Mobley was described as \\"in good health but overwhelmed\\". She had been living in South Carolina under the name Alexis Manigo and had since graduated from Colleton County High School and had a boyfriend. She had been raised alongside Gloria Williams' two other children. Mobley connected with her father and grandmother over FaceTime and planned to reunite with other biological family members in person. She had never met her biological father, as he was incarcerated at the time of her birth for drug possession and delivery and because he was 19 while Shanara was 15 at the time of Kamiyah's conception. Williams was arrested in South Carolina and extradited to Florida, where she was charged with kidnapping and interfering with custody. She had a prior history with law enforcement, having previously been charged with check and welfare fraud. Mobley described Williams as \\"no felon\\" and insisted that Williams raised her with \\"everything [she] needed\\". In February 2018, Williams pleaded guilty to kidnapping. She admitted she acted alone in the 1998 abduction. On June 8, 2018, Gloria Williams was sentenced to 18 years in prison for the kidnapping of Kamiyah Mobley. Kamiyah still communicates with her kidnapper, Gloria Williams, whom she still refers to as her mother. Williams is currently serving her sentence at the Hernando Correctional Institution and is scheduled for release on July 9, 2034. Adaptation Lifetime announced a film called Stolen by My Mother: The Kamiyah Mobley Story which aired on January 18, 2020 as part of its \\"Ripped from the Headlines\\" feature film. The film stars Rayven Ferrell as Kamiyah Mobley, Niecy Nash as Gloria Williams, and Ta'Rhonda Jones as Shanara Mobley. Robin Roberts serves as the executive producer.

It is Rebecca's birthday and Kara and Sara planned to celebrate it with their whole family and friends. Laura notices a strange bear mascot who is continuing to stare at them.

Kara is then used as a prop for an entertainment trick and gets kidnapped by Alex and then becomes unconscious. The Suarez's evacuate the area but, Laura is inside the kitchen and gets confronted by Lucille. Laura begs for Lucille's forgiveness and she wants to forgive her too, but, Lucille listens to Antonio's apparition and hits Laura in the head, which causes her to become unconscious. The bear mascot uncovers herself to Kara and it is Alex. Alex becomes even more desperate for her son and is now holding Kara and Sara as hostages.

The principle part of the controversy took place in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, but the questions raised have remained unresolved until today. The debates initially centered around Maimonides‚Äô writings after they had been made accessible to French rabbinic scholars by translation to Hebrew from Judeo-Arabic and stood in direct relation to Maimonides‚Äô project of mediating Jewish tradition and Greco-Arabic philosophy and science. However, characters within the controversy can often not be clearly ascribed to one camp (‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù or ‚Äútradition‚Äù), these are simplified and polemic categories, used in the literature contemporary to the controversy itself. The four phases of the controversy No other Jewish philosophical writings have produced such controversy as Maimonides‚Äô The Guide for the Perplexed. The Maimonidean Controversy is in secondary historiographic literature often divided into four phases where heated debate was not infrequently joined with reciprocal bans. First Stage: 1180-1204 Already in the last years of Maimonides‚Äô life, a controversy erupted based on theological grounds when he critiqued the institution of exile Judaism within which geonim (rabbinic scholars) found a comfortable living through stipends or donations. Maimonides‚Äô view was that they ‚Äì like himself ‚Äì should work in a second occupation to sustain themselves. This fell into a time when Shmuel ben Ali tried to minimize the Exilarch‚Äôs power for the benefit of the geonim. In addition to his institutional critique, in the introduction to his Mishneh Torah, Maimonides suggested that this work would make the employment of rabbinic scholars redundant. At this stage, even though some philosophical issues were discussed, mainly Maimonides‚Äô revolutionary views were seen to be on Talmud scholarship and Jewish leadership. First Stage in Europe The main subject of the controversy in Europe had been Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, which he wrote in Hebrew. His previous works had been written in Judeo-Arabic, and so were inaccessible to European scholars outside of the Iberian Peninsula. The controversy heated up when most of Maimonides‚Äô works had been translated to Hebrew, most notably The Guide to the Perplexed in 1204 by ibn Tibbon. Maimonides‚Äô works had been unsurprising for Jewish scholars immersed in the Arabic philosophical tradition whose critique was mostly limited to his social criticism and his unconventional methodology. When his works reached Christian Europe, however, they fell on largely traditional ground, in the sense that scholarship (neither Jewish nor Christian) had been largely unexposed to science or philosophy. Maimonides didn‚Äôt provide any citations in his Mishne Torah, for which he was mainly criticized by the French Abraham ben David of Posqui√®res (\\"the RaBaD\\"). His critical gloss (hasagah) to his introduction is since the 16th century included in the editions of the Mishne Torah. He also articulates a theoretical critique of Maimonides‚Äô declaration of corporealist beliefs as heresy. Although it is never really clear whether Maimonides actually denies bodily resurrection, he is accused as such by ben David. Meir Abulafia (\\"the RaMaH\\") was initially an admirer of Maimonides. When he found, however, about charges against Maimonides being in denial of resurrection, he responded furiously and disappointedly. But when he saw Maimonides‚Äô ambiguously apologetic Treatise on Resurrection (1190‚Äì91), published in response to the charges, he was calmed, convinced that Maimonides actually did believe in the bodily resurrection. After Maimonides‚Äô death 1204, the controversy simmered down. Second Stage: 1230-1235 The context for the second stage of the Maimononidean Controversy was Hachmei Provence in southern France where Maimonides‚Äô work became a platform on which the general conflict between philosophy and tradition could be contested. Maimonides‚Äô work fell into a time of ideological formation of a Christian Europe, with the Crusades and the Spanish Reconquista. Mystical tendencies and kabbalistic circles were on the rise in Spain, and philosophy had enjoyed a great flourishing also of Jewish authors under Muslim rule in al-Andalus. Maimonides‚Äô projects to combine Jewish tradition with Greco-Arabic Aristotelianism ‚Äì a problem already in the Talmud addressed as ‚ÄúGreek wisdom‚Äù (hokhmah yevanit). Wolfson generalizes this to be an issue common to Latin, Arabic and Jewish traditions who all attempted ‚ÄúPhilonic‚Äù structures to combine reason with revelation.Wolfson, Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism, Christianity and Islam (1947) Maimonides' attempt to synthesize philosophy with revelation followed similar attempts by Philo, Abraham ibn Daud and Saadia Gaon, but it arrived in Europe as Greek texts became more accessible to Christian scholars following the Sack of Constantinople and as the spread of universities spread challenged monasteries as the monopolies of scholarship. As the Catholic Church and the French crown conducted a military campaign against Catharism in Occitania and adjacent regions, both anti-Maimonidean rabbis and Catholic Dominican inquisitors were quick to draw connections between Catharism and Maimonides‚Äô thought. In 1232 rabbis of northern France, lead by Nachmanideans Yonah ben Abraham Gerondi and Meshullam da Piera, issued a ban against the study of philosophy including The Guide to the Perplexed and Sefer HaMada, the introduction to the Mishneh Torah that contained philosophical readings. The traditionalists accused philosophers of denying miracles, regarding prophecy as a natural phenomenon, undermining the Torah‚Äôs authority, rejecting traditional eschatology, engaging in allegorization, denying historicity of persons and events, and laxity of observance of the commandments. Ben-Sasson, Haim Hillel, et al. \\"Maimonidean Controversy.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica, edited by Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik, 2nd ed., vol. 13, Macmillan Reference USA, 2007, pp. 371-381. When, however, in 1232 Maimonides‚Äô books were confiscated and burnt by Dominicans (although there are stories about this being initiated by anti-Maimonideans who brought the books to the attention of the authorities, the historical situation is more than unclear), the Jewish communities of Provence, northern France and northern Spain were shocked and many anti-Maimonideans relented their views. Letters exchanged during the 1230s between David Kimhi and Yuda Alfakhar are preserved in Iggeroth Qena‚Äôoth, it was suggested by S. Harvey that this served as model for Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera‚Äôs Epistle of Debate. Abraham Maimonides, Maimonides‚Äô son, was outraged when he hears of the accusations brought against his father in Europe. The desecration of Maimonides‚Äô tomb and the burning of Talmudic literature in the 1240s in Paris set the debates aside for a few decades.D.J. Silver, Maimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy, 1180‚Äì1240 (1965). Third Stage: 1288-1290 The third stage is far less significant and involved a far lesser scope. It is, however, indicative for the diverging contexts of Christian Europe and Muslim-ruled North Africa and Middle East. Shlomo Petit had immigrated to Palestine in 1288 and taught Kabbalah in Acre where he continued agitating against Maimonides‚Äô thought. He found himself, however, in an environment long accustomed to science and philosophy (in contrast to his native Christian Europe), and earned not only ridicule playing on his name (peti-fool) but was also banned 4 times. He also seemed to have forgotten that he fell under the Egyptian nagid‚Äôs jurisdiction, who happened to be Maimonides‚Äô grandson. Also Ibn Falaquera in Europe sends letters of opposition.J. Sarachek, Faith and Reason: the Conflict over the Rationalism of Maimonides (1935). Fourth Stage: 1300-1306 In this last controversy, the entry of philosophy into tradition was not debated anymore ‚Äì Maimonidean ideas had found support even amongst the traditionalists who now sought to limit the study of philosophical works at the expense of traditional scholarship. Kabbalistic practices and esoteric exegesis had become commonplace amongst the ‚Äúphilosophers‚Äù, on basis of which (especially astral magic ‚Äì which, ironically, had been denied reality by Maimonides) they were accused for idolatry. Abba Mari of Lunel approached Shlomo ibn Aderet (\\"the RaShbA\\") of Barcelona because he saw the philosopher‚Äôs allegorical interpretations and subsidizing of the Torah‚Äôs authority with Aristotle. Ibn Aderet himself, however, had engaged in astral magic earlier in his life, and denied that it was in any way offensive to halakha.Ben-Sasson, Haim Hillel, et al. \\"Maimonidean Controversy.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica, edited by Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik, 2nd ed., vol. 13, Macmillan Reference USA, 2007, pp. 371-381. Nonetheless, in 1305 he issued a local ban against extreme allegory and the study of Greek physics and metaphysics by anyone under the age of 25. Shlomo ibn Aderet and allies in southern France hoped this would lead to similar bans by French rabbis. Menachem Meiri and Jedaiah ben Abraham Bedersi, Astruc‚Äôs main opponents, rejected this ban, as well as accusations for lax observance. Jacob Anatoli (1194‚Äì1296), however, in his Malmad HaTalmidim, did draw heavily on allegorical interpretation, including cosmological readings of Torah passages, ‚Äòin the manner of the Christians‚Äô, as his opponents were quick to accuse him of. Meiri issued a counter-ban against Astruc, emphasizing that philosophy and ‚ÄúGreek wisdom‚Äù was as important as the study of the Torah, as long as they went hand in hand. Bedersi followed suit with a Letter of Apology (Kitav Hitnatslut), a sharp attack against the ‚Äútraditionalists‚Äù. After this, the last stage of the controversy faded out, and found a shocking end in the expulsion of the Jews from France in 1306.Ben- Sasson, Haim Hillel, et al. \\"Maimonidean Controversy.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica, edited by Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik, 2nd ed., vol. 13, Macmillan Reference USA, 2007, pp. 371-381.  Aftermath  Even now, the Maimonidean project is not concluded, the question about the possibility or impossibility to combine Jewish tradition and science/philosophy was never resolved. For example, in the 16th century, Moses Isserles defended philosophy against Solomon Luria. While this continues to be debated (as it does in Christian, Muslim or secular cultures), Maimonides is today counted among the greatest of Jewish tradition. In fact, most opponents to philosophy made apologetically sure, that they could not be misunderstood in violating the authority of Maimonides.

Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments cumulatively containing all verses of this chapter in Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q76 (4QXIIa; 150‚Äì125 BCE) with extant verse 2;Dead sea scrolls - Jonah 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 25 BCE) with extant verses 1‚Äì3; and Wadi Murabba'at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75-100 CE) with extant verses 1‚Äì10.

(2.3) l. 2. p. 92. (using Herodotus' definition of \\"a day's journey\\" to be \\"150 stadia\\" or about 19 miles,Herodotus. Terpsichore, sive l. 5. c. 53. a \\"three days' journey\\" is about 450 stadia). The area (in form of parallelogram) of ancient Nineveh in Central Assyria borders Khorsabad in northeast, Koyunjik and Nebbi Yunus near the Tigris in northwest, Nimroud, between the Tigris and the Zab, in southwest; and Karamless, at a distance inland from the Zab, in southeast. The distance between Koyunjik and Nimroud is about 18 miles, as well as between Khorsabad and Karamless. It is 13 or 14 miles from Koyunjik to Khorsabad, and 14 miles from Nimroud to Karamless. The length (which was greater than the breadth) is comparable to Jonah 3:4, \\"a day's journey\\" (about 19 miles according to Herodotus as described above). Its walls were a hundred feet high, and could allow three chariots side-by-side, protected by more than 1500 lofty towers. The oldest palaces are found at Nimroud (probably the original site). Austen Henry Layard latterly has thought that the name Nineveh belonged originally to Koyunjik, rather than to Nimroud. Jonah (Jonah 4:11) mentions the children as numbering one hundred twenty thousand, which would give about a million to the whole population. Existing ruins show that Nineveh acquired its greatest extent under the kings of the second dynasty, that is, the kings mentioned in Scripture; it was then that Jonah visited it, and the reports of its magnificence were carried to the west [Layard].Austen Henry Layard, A Popular Account of Discoveries at Nineveh, J.

The signs of penitence mentioned in verse 5 were not exhibited in obedience to any royal command, but rather through the impression made by the prophet as spread among the people, and then while they were showing their sorrow this manner, the news reached the king, and he put himself at the leader of it.

At this time the northwest Semitic word for \\"king\\" (mlk), especially when associated with a city, often meant \\"governor\\" of a province rather than king over a nation.

German archaeologist Walter Andrae found 135 stone monuments in the city of A≈°≈°ur. Most of them are probably from the century just preceding the historical Jonah. Some of these stelae actually designate the governor of Nineveh by substantially the same cuneiform signs used on the bilingual statue. In one stele he is called the ‚Äògovernor of the city of Nineveh‚Äô (no. 128) and on another the ‚Äògovernor of the province of Nineveh‚Äô (no. 66).W. Andrae, Stelenreihen in A≈°≈°ur (WVDOG 24, 1913) 62, 63, 84, 85. Both expressions could be expressed in Hebrew by the phrase ‚Äòking of Nineveh‚Äô (melek n√Ænƒïveh). Apparently in such contexts Assyrians did not carefully distinguish between a province or a city.In his second campaign Sennacherib turned over captured Kassite cities to the governor of the city of Arrapha (also a province). R. Borger, Assyrische Lesest√ºcke (Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1963) II.6. The terms could be used interchangeably. The same basic phrasing occurs in the eponym lists. These are the names of Assyrian officials who had the honour of having the year named after them. Governors of Nineveh held this office in 789 and 761 BC.A.R.

Clifton joined the New Zealand Military Forces in 1915 but was too young to serve abroad during the First World War and was posted to the New Zealand Staff Corps. He was seconded to the Indian Army from 1918 to 1921 and served in the Waziristan Campaign. Returning to New Zealand he held a series of staff posts as well attending military courses. He volunteered to join the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) upon the outbreak of the Second World War. Initially the brigade major of the 5th Infantry Brigade in 1940, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed commander of the Divisional Engineers, 2nd New Zealand Division. He participated in the Battle of Greece as well as the early fighting in North Africa for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and bar. Given command of the 6th Infantry Brigade in February 1942, he was captured during the fighting around El Alamein in September 1942. As a prisoner of war, Clifton made a total of nine escape attempts including from camps in Italy and Germany. His last escape attempt saw him reach American lines in March 1945 and his exploits as a prisoner of war were recognised with a further bar to his DSO. After the war he served on the staff of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, commanded a training school, and was posted to the War Office in London. His final appointment before retiring from the New Zealand Military Forces in 1953 was as commander of the Northern Military District. He became a sheep farmer in later life and spent his final years as a city councillor in Taupo. He died in 1970 at the age of 71. Early life Clifton was born on 18 September 1898 in Greenmeadows, near Napier, the son of an immigrant from the United States. He received his primary education at a school in Wairoa and attended Pahiatua District High School before taking civil service examinations. However, rather than pursue a business career, he decided to join the New Zealand Military Forces in 1915. He was one of New Zealand's regular annual intake of 10 cadets to enter the Australian Army's Royal Military College in Duntroon in the Australian Capital Territory. Military career On graduation from Duntroon in 1918, Clifton was posted to the New Zealand Staff Corps. Although the First World War had not yet ended, he was too young to serve abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. Instead he was stationed as an instructor at Trentham Military Camp before becoming aide-de-camp to Major General Alfred Robin, the commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces. In late 1918, he was seconded to the Indian Army and served on the Derajat Column during the Waziristan Campaign on the North-West Frontier of India. During his service, he was awarded the Military Cross. His secondment ended in early 1921 and he returned to New Zealand and resumed his duties with the New Zealand Staff Corps. Clifton held a series of staff posts with the Territorial Force while seeking a further secondment to India or, failing that, a post with the Royal Engineers. In aid of the latter goal, he was sent to England to attend the School of Military Engineering. Back in New Zealand by 1926, he was promoted to the rank of captain and appointed adjutant of engineers, signals, and mounted units in the Auckland region. He commenced a two-year course at the Staff College in Camberley in 1932, after which was attached to firstly, the Committee of Imperial Defence, and then the War Office in London. He returned to New Zealand in 1935 and posted as a staff officer at the headquarters of the New Zealand Military Forces. Second World War When the Second World War broke out, Clifton was the duty officer at the military's headquarters in Wellington and dispatched the orders that mobilised the New Zealand Military Force. Promoted to major shortly afterwards, he was an instructor at Narrow Neck Camp in Auckland during the period in which the first echelon of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) was being raised. He was initially selected to command 24th Battalion, 6th Infantry Brigade, but this was reconsidered when the commander of the 2NZEF, Major General Bernard Freyberg, decreed that the battalion commanders of the brigade be under the age of 35; Clifton was 41. However, when offered the post of Brigade Major for the 5th Infantry Brigade by its commander, Brigadier James Hargest, he gratefully accepted. Clifton embarked for the Middle East with the second echelon of the 2NZEF, the bulk of which were the troops of the 5th Brigade in early May 1940. However, following the invasion of France, and the entry of Italy into the war, the convoy transporting 5th Brigade were diverted to England, where it arrived in mid-June. The brigade would form part of the defences in the south of England, in anticipation of the expected invasion by German forces. A few months after his arrival in England, Clifton was appointed commander of the Divisional Engineers and promoted to lieutenant colonel. Along with the 2nd New Zealand Division, Clifton participated in the Battle of Greece. This resulted in a defeat for the Allied forces which were forced to leave the country to avoid capture by the Germans. During the evacuation, he commanded the divisional rearguard, which was designated 'Clifton Force'. Traveling onto Egypt after being transported to Crete, he missed the subsequent Battle of Crete. He was later recognised for his services in Greece with the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). North Africa Back in Egypt, the 2nd New Zealand Division underwent a period of refit and training before it was assigned to the British Eighth Army, which was then engaged in the North African Campaign. It took part in Operation Crusader in November 1941 where the Eighth Army attempted to break through to Tobruk. Clifton earned a bar to his DSO during Operation Crusader when, during the Battle of Sidi Rizegh, he led a convoy of supply trucks which delivered vital ordnance to artillery units shelling advancing elements of the Afrika Corps. In February 1942, Clifton was promoted to brigadier and given command of 6th Infantry Brigade which, at the time, was in Syria along with the rest of the division. However, following the attack on the 8th Army's Gazala Line by Panzer Army Africa, the 2nd New Zealand Division was dispatched to the lines of El Alamein and while its 4th and 5th Brigades went south to Minqar Qaim, the 6th Brigade, was initially held in reserve before being ordered to man the Kaponga Box at Bab el Qattara. The brigade remained here, watching first the retreating British stream by and then the Germans, at a distance, for several days before moving to Amiriya. It missed the action of 14‚Äì15 July at Ruweisat Ridge which saw the destruction of a large part of the 4th and 5th Brigades. The 6th Brigade was recalled back to the El Alamein lines to relieve what was left of the 4th Brigade. A few days later, it was involved in a nighttime attack on the El Mrier Depression. The aim was to secure the depression to create a route through which British armour could penetrate. The brigade successfully achieved its objective and was consolidating its positions when the 21st Panzer Division attacked on 22 July. At daylight, the tanks of the 21st Panzer Division caught Clifton's brigade headquarters which, along with 24th and 25th Battalions, was positioned in the relatively shallow El Mrier Depression. Firing from the edge of a low cliff overlooking the depression, the Germans caused heavy losses amongst the infantry battalions before passing through their positions in pursuit of the British armour. Over 900 men were either killed, wounded, or captured including the majority of 24th Battalion and half of the 25th Battalion. Clifton, with his brigade headquarters, had been among those captured. Removing his rank insignia, he pretended to be a medical orderly. That evening, he played dead and managed to escape. The remnants of Clifton's brigade moved to the southern section of the Alamein line where it manned defensive positions during the Battle of Alam Halfa, Rommel's failed attempt to cut off the Eighth Army. On the night of 3 September, the brigade was involved in a nighttime attack during which the commander of its 26th Battalion was mortally wounded. With the battalion leaderless and disorganised, Clifton tried to restore order. He approached what he thought were friendly troops only to find himself in the hands of the Italian 185th Folgore Division. Debriefed personally by the commander of the Panzer Army Africa, Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, Clifton was taken away afterwards by truck but promptly jumped out to try and escape. Chased down by the guards, he was recaptured only to give them the slip again. He walked for five days to El Alamein before he was noticed by the crew of a German tank and captured. Taken before Rommel again, he was threatened with a firing squad if he was to escape again. He was flown to Italy the next day. Prisoner of war Held in a prisoner of war camp, Clifton soon managed to escape and made his way as far as the Swiss border before being recaptured. Transferred to a punishment camp at Gavi, he made three further escape attempts, the last of which was in September 1943 and involved the digging of a tunnel with 60 other prisoners. Detected before they could break out, the prisoners were moved to a camp in Germany. While en route, Clifton jumped from the train transporting them through Germany. His escape was short lived and while hiding in a bush near the train tracks, he was shot in the leg and stomach by a guard. Other prisoners, under guard, retrieved him and dressed his wounds. Taken to a hospital, he was treated for his wounds; the bullet, which had lodged in his stomach, was later given to him as a souvenir. In March 1944, after recuperating for four months, he was placed in a camp near Hadamar which was specially designated for recidivist escapees. His last escape attempt was in March 1945, when he managed to make his way over several barbed wire fences and evade guards. Disguised as a labourer from Holland, he was able to reach advancing American troops and, having established his identity, was flown to England and then onto New Zealand, he arrived in April 1945 and was treated in a servicemen's hospital in Rotorua. He received a second bar to his DSO for his exploits as a prisoner of war, having made a total of nine escape attempts from captivity. However, shortly after his return to New Zealand, his wife, Doris, died. Postwar After the war ended, Clifton was based in Singapore, working towards the reparation of New Zealanders that had been interned by the Japanese. In March 1946, he was posted to the staff of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, where he remained for a year before returning to New Zealand to take up command of the training school at Trentham Military Camp. In his final years in the military, he was attached to the War Office in London for a time, and then commanded the Northern Military District back in New Zealand before retiring in 1953. The previous year, his book The Happy Hunted, an account of his wartime experiences, was published. In 1953, Clifton was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. Later life In his retirement, Clifton took up sheepfarming in the Hawke's Bay region for several years. In 1966, he then shifted to Taupo where he became a city councillor. He died on 13 March 1970 and is buried in the Returned Servicemen's Association section of the Taupo Cemetery.

Political career  Johnson greeting students He was elected in 2014 to an at-large seat on Forsyth County School Board and spent two years on the board. In August 2015, Johnson filed papers to run for the position of North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction in 2016. In the November 2016 election, Johnson won with 50.6% of the vote, narrowly defeating the Democratic incumbent June Atkinson. Atkinson had served 11 years in the post and had worked for the department for about 28 years before becoming superintendent. She was the longest-serving state superintendent in the nation. Johnson became the first Republican to win the position in more than a hundred years.Brian Gordon, NC superintendent Johnson talks teacher anger, performance grades, rural funds, and more, Asheville Citizen Times (January 25, 2020). In 2019, Johnson supported a 5% salary increase for North Carolina teachers by 2030, which would allow the average teacher salary in North Carolina to approach the median 2019 household income in North Carolina. He also proposed to increase funding for textbooks and digital media. As state superintendent, Johnson had a combative style; when he later announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor, he described himself as \\"in the trenches fighting the deep state in state bureaucracy.\\"State Superintendent Mark Johnson announces candidacy for lieutenant governor, WITN (November 12, 2019).Jamey Cross, State Superintendent Mark Johnson announces run for lieutenant governor, Daily Tar Heel (November 12, 2019).

In 2016, shortly after Johnson's election, the North Carolina General Assembly enacted legislation in a special session to shift power from the State Board of Education to the state superintendent, granting Johnson power over the $10 billion North Carolina education budget. This prompted a legal battle, culminating in a North Carolina Supreme Court decision, in which both sides claimed a partial victory.Alex Granados, Strife between state board, Superintendent Mark Johnson continues, WRAL (July 2, 2018). In January 2020, Johnson and the board clashed over Johnson's signing of a $930,000 \\"emergency contract\\" for a Web-based reading assessment tool designed for kindergartens through 3rd graders in support of the state's \\"Read To Achieve\\" program.Jeff Tiberii, State Superintendent Makes Istation Purchase, Billionaire Candidates Spend Big, January 10, 2020).Cole del Charco, SBE and State Superintendent Clash Over Reading Tool Contract, WUMC (January 9, 2020).Cole del Charco, Company That Lost NC's K-3 Reading Assessment Contract Files Protest, WUNC (June 25, 2019). The value of the emergency contract was just below the dollar threshold requiring board approval, and a rival company that lost the contract subsequently filed a bid protest, contending that the software selected did not meet state requirements. After \\"a year of legal, political and academic wrangling\\" over the decision, school districts were given the power to choose the early-learning reading assessment tool they would use for the 2020-21 school year. In February 2020, Johnson used a state database to send 540,000 text messages and 800,000 emails to parents and teachers, polling them about Common Core.Travis Fain, NC schools superintendent texted a half million parents and teachers to get feedback on Common Core, WRAL (February 11, 2020).

Johnson's department defended the use of a state database to send the texts and emails. As superintendent, Johnson supported the creation of a new position of assistant superintendent for early childhood education and launched NC Reads, a statewide reading program. Prior to the start of the 2018 school year, Johnson announced that all K-3 teachers would be receiving new iPads as part of the state's \\"Read to Achieve\\" program using existing funds. Johnson announced changes to the state's standardized test procedures, including fewer questions on exams, \\"allowing students to leave the exams sooner and easing rules requiring exam proctors.\\"T.K.

In partnership with the nonprofit Sandy Hook Promise, formed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, Johnson launched a \\"Say Something\\" app, allowing North Carolina students to anonymously report tips or incidents. Johnson has opposed the idea of arming North Carolina teachers with guns, an idea promoted by Donald Trump and others. However, Johnson does favor more funding for school resource officers.Liz Schlemmer, Poll Finds Most NC Teachers Don't Want To Carry Guns, WUMC (March 2, 2018).

This expression is now in the common language to describe a long period of time marked by particularly adverse events. It refers to a strong negative opinion of a decade in which Italian companies, despite their economic prosperity and the beginning of the technological development that took place in those years, began a steady decline due to a particularly corrupt political class, and sometimes colluding with criminal organizations such as Cosa Nostra (the Sicilian Mafia). At that time the Propaganda Due, a secret Masonic organization, was also discovered. The expression owes its success primarily to the Italian journalist Indro Montanelli, which he called L'Italia degli anni di fango (Italy of the Years of Mud) the volume of Storia d'Italia dedicated to the years 1978-1993, a period that begins roughly with the election of Sandro Pertini as President of the Italian Republic and ends with the discovery and the start of Tangentopoli.

Although the ruling Patriotic Front has pledged to free state-owned media‚Äîconsisting of the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) and the widely circulated Zambia Daily Mail and Times of Zambia‚Äîfrom government editorial control, these outlets have generally continued to report along pro- government lines. Many journalists reportedly practice self-censorship since most government newspapers do have prepublication review. The ZNBC dominates the broadcast media, though several private stations have the capacity to reach large portions of the population. The rights group Freedom House, which publishes annual country reports on press freedom status, has ranked Zambia‚Äôs press as ‚ÄúNot Free‚Äù even in 2016.  Recent threats to press freedom  The government and ruling party, ‚ÄúPatriotic Front‚Äù, regularly take punitive steps against critical news outlets. In 2016, government authorities ordered the closure of the publishing company Post Newspapers Limited, on 21 June, demanding $6.1 million tax in arrears. This closure occurred after The Post accused Zambian authorities of selectively applying the law to target the publication for its news coverage. There were some accusations on the part of the PF party by Reporters Without Borders that condemn attacks on media pluralism during the campaign for 2016 presidential election in Zambia due to the ruling Patriotic Front's harassment and threats against several news outlets. Media coverage has also been very partisan during the campaign, with the main opposition party, the United Party for National Development (UPND), filing a complaint against the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) for failing to cover the rallies of its candidate, Hakainde Hichilema. In 2014, journalists and outlets faced harassment and physical attacks both in the course of their work and in retaliation for their reporting, and media practitioners reported a general climate of increased intimidation. Community and privately owned radio stations encountered intensified harassment and threats by local government officials and PF party cadres, especially after hosting opposition figures on call-in shows or criticizing local officials on the air. In April 2014, PF cadres raided Sun FM in Copperbelt Province during an interview with Hakainde Hichilema (an opposition presidential candidate for United Party for National Development in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2015 and 2016) forcing the candidate to flee. In September, PF cadres went to the offices of independent Breeze FM, in the eastern town of Chipata. They threatened to assault the news editor in retribution for statements made during a live program about the party‚Äôs poor showing in a recent by-election.  Legal environment  Since gaining independence on October 24, 1964, Zambia has passed a number of laws affecting press freedom. The Defamation Act of 1964 restricts freedom of expression, among other things by criminalizing defamation. The State Security Act of 1969 limits free speech and media freedom, thereby restricting the possibility to criticize the government and its officials. The Telecommunication Act of 1994 establishes an authority, which administers radio frequency spectrum leaving the approval of licenses under the authority of the Minister of Information and Broadcasting Services. The ZNBC Amendment Act of 2002 and Independent Broadcasting Authority Act of 2002 were efforts made to establish independent regulations on freedom of the Press, but could not be implemented, as the issues were not resolved in the Courts as of 2005. On June 8, 2010, Pansy Tlakula, the African Union's special rapporteur on freedom of expression try to persuade the Zambian government to repeal section 116(1)(d) of the Zambian Penal Code, ‚Äúwhich criminalizes speech or writing that could prejudice opinion regarding ongoing judicial proceedings.‚Äù This according to him is contrary to what is obtainable in the regional and international law for freedom of expression. It was on April 30, 2012 that a draft constitution was released that had provisions on freedom of the press. The draft constitution, Article 38 guarantees freedom and independence for electronic, print, and other media. Part of it holds that, (a) The State shall not exercise control over, or interfere with, any person engaged in broadcasting, the production or circulation of any publication, or the dissemination of information by any medium; or (b) penalize any person for any opinion or the content of any broadcast, publication or dissemination. (First Draft Constitution of the Republic of Zambia) The article goes on to say that government-controlled media will also be able to operate independently. The Press Association of Zambia (PAZA), and Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) supported this idea. It is a giant step towards the media law reforms that helps in providing freedom of the media.‚Äù Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP)  Media market  ZNBC is leading in control of the media market in Zambia, together with the two newspapers belonging to the State and The Post. There are four major newspapers in Zambia: Times of Zambia and the Zambia Daily which are owned by the State; The Post which is the only independent newspaper and Sunday Times of Zambia which is sponsored by UNIP. The publication remains only in English language with the range of about 25,000-50,000 in circulations. The newspapers operate also online services. There are about 9 Television stations and 28 Radio stations in Zambia. Zambia in the recent times is witnessing the establishment of many private television and radio stations with different audiences. Some are independent newspapers and private radio stations. Radio stations like UNZA Radio, Radio Phoenix and Pan African Radio do programs that express wild range of expressions and critical viewpoints. ‚ÄúRadio remains the medium of choice in most of the country because of its relatively low cost of access, but many stations face financial difficulties due to their dependence on sponsored programming and the small advertising market.‚Äù ZANIS- Zambia News and information Services remains the state-owned agency in the country as a public relations wing of government under the Ministry of Information, Broadcasting Services. The Internet has remained one of the main sources that journalists and bloggers in Zambia use to express their critical views about the government. Some websites like Zambia reports and Zambia Watchdog, which are famous, have suffered partial interruptions and blocking of signals by the government in the past. The 2015 report of the freedom house estimated that Internet penetration in Zambia is 21 percent of the population. Those in the Urban cities have more access to the Internet services than those in the rural areas who encounter poor signals and high cost payment.

O'Keeffe said that she made the paintings to reflect the way she herself saw flowers, although others have called her depictions erotic, and compared them to female genitalia. O'Keeffe said they had misconstrued her intentions for doing her flower paintings: \\"Well ‚Äì I made you take time to look at what I saw and when you took time to really notice my flower you hung all your own associations with flowers on my flower and you write about my flower as if I think and see what you think and see of the flower ‚Äì and I don't.\\" O'Keeffe was not unaware of the sexual references in her work, but male art critics' misinterpretations of these references perpetuated a sexual understanding of her work that was very different from her original intention. She expressed herself through the use of vibrant colors like red, yellow, and orange. Overview A gardener, O'Keeffe was often inspired to make a dozen or more paintings of a specific flower. She became interested in brilliant colors and billowy petals of the canna lilies when she visited Lake George, New York in 1918 with Alfred Stieglitz. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts states that \\"In these extreme close-ups she established a new kind of modern still life with no references to atmospheric effects or realistic details, reflecting her statement, 'I paint because color is significant.'\\" As she evolved as an artist, her works became suggestive of female form, like Inside Red Canna. Paul Rosenfeld, who owned one of her Red Canna paintings, said \\"... there is no stroke laid by her brush, whatever it is she may paint, that is not curiously, arrestingly female in quality. Essence of very womanhood permeates her pictures.\\" Red Canna (1915) watercolor Georgia O'Keeffe, Red Canna, 1915, Yale University Art Gallery In 1915, O'Keeffe painted a watercolor of a bouquet of red canna blossoms on paper. The work, , is among the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery. Small Red Canna (1919) A small painting of a close-up of a red canna lily was made by O'Keefe in 1919. The oil painting depicts the flower against a dark cloudy background. Owned by a private collector, it is on extended loan to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum. It was stolen from the Santa Fe, New Mexico museum by a security guard, William Crumpton, who pleaded guilty on October 26, 2004 to stealing paintings and cash from the museum and a government office. The painting, valued at , was recovered. Red Canna (1919) Georgia O'Keeffe, Red Canna, 1919, High Museum of Art, Atlanta Painted in oil on a board, the red canna lily framed by green and dark yellow background colors at the top and right of the painting and dark blue at the bottom and left. The carefully blended colors and voluptuous curves reflect her emerging personal style. Once owned by Pollitzer family members of North Carolina, it was displayed at Columbia College in South Carolina, where O'Keeffe was an instructor. The painting was acquired by High Museum of Art of Atlanta by 2015. Inside Red Canna (1919) She painted an extreme close-up of the canna lily entitled Inside the Red Canna in 1919. It is an erotic depiction of the large petals of the exterior of the flower, with focus on the interior through the use of contrasting shades of colors. The painting was made with red, orange, brown, and pink paint. The abstract oil painting is owned by private collectors. Red Canna (1923) The version made in 1923 is an oil painting of a red canna lily against a yellow background. The Lily nearly fills the canvas. It is owned by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Red Canna (1924)  The 1924 painting, a close-up of the flower with streaks of light blue and gray, immerses the viewer in the blossom, and is meant to convey the way that O'Keeffe experiences it. In the 1920s it was believed to be among the collection of Flora Stieglitz Strauss and possibly that of O'Keeffe in 1953. It was in private collections until 1993, when it was acquired by Sotheby's in New York. It was last recorded to be in the private collection of A. Alfred Taubman.

It was aired on ABC on September 21, 2016 in the United States, CTV in Canada, and on Netflix worldwide. The episode shows Thomas \\"Tom\\" Kirkman (Kiefer Sutherland), a low-ranking member of the US Cabinet, unexpectedly ascending to the rank of President of the United States after his predecessor and every other member of the presidential line of succession is killed in a terrorist attack. Synopsis On the night of January 20, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Thomas Kirkman and his wife Alex are watching the State of the Union address from a secure location. Earlier that day, he had been offered the position of Ambassador to the International Civil Aviation Organization (which, in practice, was a way of firing him). He is not in attendance himself because, as a final snub, he has been nominated the designated survivor ‚Äì a custom used every time the President, Vice President, and other members of the line of succession are gathered in a single place (such as at State of the Union addresses and Presidential inaugurations), where a low-ranking person in the line of succession is kept in a secret location to ensure that someone can succeed to the Presidency in the event of a catastrophe. Unexpectedly, the news feed cuts out. Moments later, his security detail rushes into the room, and when Kirkman opens the security shutter on the window, an enormous fireball has engulfed the Capitol Building. Kirkman and his wife are rushed from their safe house, while another security detail goes off to find their children. En route to the White House, Kirkman‚Äôs body guard receives confirmation that the blast has killed everyone who attended the State of the Union, including President Richmond, the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, the rest of the Cabinet, everyone in both houses of Congress, many of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all nine of the Supreme Court Justices. Under the Presidential Succession Act, Kirkman is now President of the United States. Upon arrival at the White House, Kirkman (dressed in jeans and a hoodie) is sworn in by a DC appellate judge. He is then escorted by Richmond‚Äôs Deputy Chief of Staff Aaron Shore to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, which is abuzz with chaos in the aftermath of the bombing. The most senior military officer in the room, General Harris Cochrane, demands that the US immediately move onto a war footing. Overwhelmed, Kirkman goes to the bathroom to vomit, in the next cubicle, speech writer Seth Wright offers sympathy and, not realizing who it is, expresses doubt in Kirkman due to his lack of political experience and seniority (as his position would normally put him twelfth in the line of succession). When he emerges, Kirkman brushes aside his embarrassment and asks Seth to write him a speech. Meanwhile, after some difficulty locating the President‚Äôs son Leo, both of the President‚Äôs children arrive at the White House, as does his Chief of Staff Emily Rhodes. President Kirkman is informed that the Iranian Navy is moving several destroyers to the Strait of Hormuz, a major provocation. General Harris suggests a swift show of force, but Kirkman decides instead to call a meeting with the Iranian Ambassador, and orders Harris to scramble bombers. At the meeting, Kirkman ‚Äì in a surprising display of strength ‚Äì warns the Ambassador that he is willing to authorize an attack on Tehran if the destroyers are not pulled back. Kirkman then delivers Seth‚Äôs speech to the nation, while Aaron and Harris discuss whether he should be removed. Elsewhere in DC, FBI agent Hannah Wells attempts to phone someone named Scott, who was present at the State of the Union, but receives no answer. She is then called away by her boss to join the investigation into the bombing. Instead of going back to HQ, she goes to the bomb site, and convinces Deputy Director Jason Atwood to let her join in. After another unsuccessful attempt at trying to reach Scott, a bomb is located amongst the rubble, which turns out not to be active. Upon investigating the bomb, it is discovered to be a Soviet anti-tank mine most commonly used by jihadist terror groups. However, Hannah expresses doubt that this is the case, because there was no chatter from any such groups. This could additionally suggest that the group who bombed the Capitol has not yet finished. Reception The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews, with Laura Akers of Den of Geek noting that the show had similarities with political drama The West Wing, and, while stating that the pilot episode had a somewhat shaky start, observing that the ‚Äúsplit focus‚Äù between Kirkman and Wells‚Äô storylines was ‚Äúunwieldy,‚Äù it had ‚Äúall the ingredients of an interesting and possibly even compelling series.‚Äù Brian Moylan of The Guardian, meanwhile, gave a negative review, with particular criticism focusing on the dialogue. Terri Schwartz of IGN praised the episode for its storyline, and in particular Sutherland‚Äôs performance.

Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Kosachev headed the State Duma's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) from 2004 to 2012. He served as vice-speaker of PACE and coordinated a Deputy group for relations with the Swedish Parliament. When considering the 2006 resolution condemning communist regimes, Kosachev declared it inadmissible to equate communism and Nazism: \\"It is impossible to equate the communist ideology and the ideology of Nazism\\".–ù–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏ NEWSru.com :: –ü–ê–°–ï –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è–ª–∞ —Ä–µ–∑–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—é, –æ—Å—É–∂–¥–∞—é—â—É—é –∫–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Ä–µ–∂–∏–º—ã. Political views Kosachev in 2016 In June 2010, Kosachev wrote an article for the Echo of Moscow website proposing that the Russian Federation devise set of principles or a historical doctrine whereby it could disclaim any financial, legal, political or moral responsibility for USSR's actions in former territories while still acting as a successor state. On 26 November 2010, on Voice of Russia, Kosachev called for the reunification of North and South Korea, where the North Korean leaders would receive guarantees of personal safety for themselves and their families.–£—Ä–µ–≥—É–ª–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∫–æ—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–ª–∏–∫—Ç–∞, –ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤—ã –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ —Å –ù–ê–¢–û –∏ –µ–≤—Ä–æ–ø–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–º–∏. In November 2011, he expressed the view that the European Monetary Union (euro zone) leave Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Latvia, because these countries have a huge government debt. At that time, neither Latvia nor Hungary is not part of the Eurozone. Kosachev opposes Russian ratification of Article 20 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. He believes that the 20th article contradicts Article 49 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and could deprive millions of Russian citizens of the presumption of innocence. In February 2017, following the resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser, Kosachev opined that Russophobia was pandemic in Donald Trump's administration.

Jonah is silenced; he can make no reply; he can only confess that he is entirely wrong, and that God is righteous.

The term might also include a set of linker histone (H1) variants, which lack a distinct canonical isoform. The differences between the core canonical histones and their variants can be summarized as follows: (1) canonical histones are replication-dependent and are expressed during the S-phase of cell cycle whereas histone variants are replication-independent and are expressed during the whole cell cycle; (2) in animals, the genes encoding canonical histones are typically clustered along the chromosome, are present in multiple copies and are among the most conserved proteins known, whereas histone variants are often single-copy genes and show high degree of variation among species; (3) canonical histone genes lack introns and use a stem loop structure at the 3‚Äô end of their mRNA, whereas histone variant genes may have introns and their mRNA tail is usually polyadenylated. Complex multicellular organisms typically have a large number of histone variants providing a variety of different functions. Recent data are accumulating about the roles of diverse histone variants highlighting the functional links between variants and the delicate regulation of organism development.  Histone variants nomenclature  Different names historically assigned to homologous proteins in different species complicate the nomenclature of histone variants. A recently suggested unified nomenclature of histone variants follows phylogeny-based approach to naming the variants. According to this nomenclature, letter suffixes or prefixes are mainly used to denote structurally distinct monophyletic clades of a histone family (e.g. H2A.Z, H2B.W, subH2B). Number suffixes are assumed to be species-specific (e.g. H1.1), but are encouraged to be used consistently between species where unique orthologies are clear. However, due to historical reasons naming of certain variants may still deviate from these rules.  Variants of histone H3  Throughout eukaryotes the most common histone H3 variants are H3.3 and centromeric H3 variant (cenH3, called also CENPA in humans). Well studied species specific variants include H3.1, H3.2, TS H3.4 (mammals), H3.5 (hominids), H3.Y (primates). Except for cenH3 histone, H3 variants are highly sequence conserved differing only by a few amino acids. Histone H3.3 has been found to play an important role in maintaining genome integrity during the mammalian development.  Variants of histone H4  Histone H4 is one of the slowest evolving proteins with no functional variants in the majority of species. The reason for a lack of sequence variants remains unclear. Trypanosoma are known to have a variant of H4 named H4.V. In Drosophila there are H4 replacement genes that are constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle that encode proteins that are identical in sequence to the major H4.  Variants of histone H2A  Histone H2A has the highest number of known variants, some of which are relatively well characterized. H2A.X is the most common H2A variant, with the defining sequence motif ‚ÄòSQ(E/D)Œ¶‚Äô (where Œ¶-represents a hydrophobic residue, usually Tyr in mammals). It becomes phosphorylated during the DNA damage response, chromatin remodeling, and X-chromosome inactivation in somatic cells. H2A.X and canonical H2A have diverged several times in phylogenetic history, but each H2A.X version is characterized by similar structure and function, suggesting it may represent the ancestral state. H2A.Z regulates transcription, DNA repair, suppression of antisense RNA, and RNA Polymerase II recruitment. Notable features of H2A.Z include a sequence motif ‚ÄòDEELD,‚Äô a one amino acid insertion in L1-loop, and a one amino acid deletion in the docking domain relative to canonical H2A. Variant H2A.Z.2 was suggested to be driving the progression of malignant melanoma. Canonical H2A can be exchanged in nucleosomes for H2A.Z with special remodeling enzymes. macroH2A contains a histone fold domain and an extra, long C-terminal macro domain which can bind poly-ADP-ribose. This histone variant is used in X-inactivation and transcriptional regulation. Structures of both domains are available, but the inter-domain linker is too flexible to be crystallized. H2A.B (Barr body deficient variant) is a rapidly evolving mammal specific variant, known for its involvement in spermatogenesis. H2A.B has a shortened docking domain, which wraps around a short DNA region. H2A.L and H2A.P variants are closely related to H2A.B, but are less studied. H2A.W is a plant specific variant with SPKK motifs at the N-terminus with a putative minor-groove-binding activity. H2A.1 is a mammalian testis, oocyte and zygote specific variant. It can preferentially dimerize with H2B.1. It is so far characterized only in mouse, but a similar gene in human is available which is located at the end of the largest histone gene cluster. Currently other less extensively studied H2A variants are starting to emerge such as H2A.J.  Variants of histone H2B  H2B histone type is known to have a limited number of variants at least in mammals, apicomplexa and sea urchins. H2B.1 is a testis, oocyte and zygote specific variant that forms subnucleosomal particles, at least, in spermatids. It can dimerize with H2A.L and H2A.1. H2B.W is involved in spermatogenesis, telomere associated functions in sperm and is found in spermatogenic cells. It is characterized by the extension of the N-terminal tail. subH2B participates in regulation of spermiogenesis and is found in non-nucleosomal particle in the subacrosome of spermatozoa. This variant has a bipartite nuclear localization signal. H2B.Z is an apicomplexan specific variant that is known to interact with H2A.Z. ‚Äòsperm H2B‚Äô is a putative group that contains sperm H2B histones from sea and sand urchins and potentially is common for Echinacea. Recently discovered variant H2B.E is involved in the regulation of olfactory neuron function in mice.

FC Basel played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium. Following their relegation the season before this was their first season in the second tier of Swiss football since the 1945‚Äì46 season.  Overview  Following their relegation after the previous Nationalliga A season the club's priority aim was to return immediately to the top flight of Swiss football. Urs Siegenthaler was first-team coach for the second consecutive season. Basel were assigned to the East group. They ended their 22 matches in the Qualifying Phase with 14 victories, four draws and four defeats with 32 points. They were group winners. The team scored 48 goals and conceded just 23. Lucio Esposito was the team's top goal scorer with 10 goals and Ralph Thoma second in the internal ranking with eight goals. Thus Basel qualified themselves for a Promotion group. Basel were assigned to group A. Also qualified for this group from the Nationalliga B were Z√ºrich, CS Ch√™nois, Grenchen, ES Malley and the Old Boys. The team's goal scoring quality was missed during the Promotion stage. In the fifth, sixth and seventh round Basel lost the two away games against Lausanne-Sports 1‚Äì4 and St. Gallen 0‚Äì3, as well as the home match against local rivals Old Boys 0‚Äì1, therefore losing very valuable points. Basel ended the group with just 19 scored goals and just 14 obtained points in fourth position and thus they missed promotion. They were nine respectively eight points behind St. Gallen and Lausanne-Sports, both of whom were quite easily able to avoid relegation. In the second round of the Swiss Cup Basel were matched away against local team Oberwil. The game was won easily, 5‚Äì0. In the next round Basel were drawn against higher classed Young Boys. Basel mastered their opponents well, winning 4‚Äì1. In the round of 32 and round of 16 Basel had two ties against lower tier teams winning both to qualify for the quarterfinals.

He was ordered to study engineering. In 1719 he was taken to the palace for \\"domestic servants\\". He was assigned as a rider to Ekaterina Alekseevna. In 1722, travelling along the River Oka to the Persian campaign, Peter I visited for the second time in Kasimov. The retinue of Peter the Great and Ivan was Balakirev. He learned that the title of the ruler of the city is not busy, and asked for permission to be called the king khan of Kasimov. King jokingly agreed, so in Kasimov reappeared khan. Initially, the title was formal, but after the death of Peter the Great, by decree of Catherine I, Balakirev received ownership of the former estate of Kasimov kings, the rank of lieutenant of the Life Guards and the title of King Kasimov. Balakirev died in Kasimov. His grave is located behind the altar of the church of St. George. In 1723 he became an approximate chamberlain of Willem Mons; served as a messenger between him and Catherine. On April 26, 1724, Balakirev informed the student of the case of Suvorov that he was carrying letters from Catherine to Mons. On November 5, 1724, an anonymous denunciation on Balakirev came to the emperor. The inquiry was entrusted to A.I. Ushakov. Peter I ordered the torture of Balakirev, and he reported on Mons bribes. Mons was executed, and Balakirev, as an accomplice, was sentenced to 60 batogo blows and exile in Paldiski for three years. In 1725, after the death of Peter the Great and the accession to the throne of Catherine I, Balakirev was returned to St. Petersburg. He was awarded the rank of praporshchik of the Preobrazhensky Regiment. Balakirev was assigned to the court of the empress without a specific position. In 1726, by decree of Catherine I, Balakirev received the right to own the former estates of the Kasimov kings, the rank of lieutenant of the Life Guards and the title of ‚ÄúTsar of Kasimov‚Äù. In 1731, Empress Anna Ioannovna enrolled Balakirev in the staff of \\"fools\\" - court jesters. He was witty, but too rude. For his speeches he was invited by the Secret Chancellery.

The practice continued during subsequent governments. The term missing persons is sometimes used as a euphemism. According to Amina Masood Janjua, a human rights activist and chairperson of Defence of Human Rights Pakistan; a not for profit organization working against enforced disappearance there are more than 5,000 reported cases of enforced disappearance in Pakistan. This is a form of targeted killings and state sponsorship of terrorism of its own citizens by The Establishment specially against the civilian nationalists such as Baloch, Sindhi, Pashtun, Punjabis, Muhajir Hazara, Ahmadiya, Shias. The Establishment The Establishment in Pakistan is the terminology used in Pakistan to describe the deep state cooperative federation of the Pakistan Armed Forces and the Pakistani intelligence community. Involved in numerous successful military coups in Pakistan, the Pakistan Army has directly ruled for nearly half of its nation's existence since Pakistan's creation in 1947, and rest of the times the army has had veto power over the civilian rule.Pakistan Extends Powerful Army Chief‚Äôs Term, Wall Street Journal, 19 Aug 2019.

The Establishment's sphere mainly consists of the country's high- ranking military officers who also control the collaborating senior civil servants, members of the Judiciary, the most important financiers and industrialists and the media moguls. The Establishment in Pakistan considers the key and elite decision makers in country's public policy, ranging from the use of the intelligence services, national security, foreign and domestic policies including the state policy of sponsoring terrorism.  From 1999 to 2008 After the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, forced disappearance in Pakistan allegedly began during the rule of military dictator General Pervez Musharraf (1999 to 2008). Pakistan went under immense terrorist activities. A large number of people became the victim of suicidal attacks. During Musharraf's tenure, during 'War on Terror', many people were suspected as terrorists and then taken away by Govt agencies. Many of them were then handed over to the United States authorities to be imprisoned in the Guantanamo Bay's Camp X-Ray. After Musharaf resigned in August 2008, he was charged with various human rights violations. According to Amina Masood Janjua, a human right's activist and chairperson of Defence of Human Rights Pakistan, a Nonprofit organization working against enforced disappearance there are more than 5000 reported cases of enforced disappearance in Pakistan, however, she asserts that the number of unreported cases is much higher. On the other hand, according to government, this figures is inflated.  From 2009 to present According to Dawn newspaper report, in the first seven months of 2016, there were 510 reports of forced disappearance in Pakistan. In 2011, a Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances was formed to investigate the cases of forced disappearances. According to Amnesty International, the commission has so far received 3,000 cases of such disappearances. * Zeenat Shahzadi: Zeenat Shahzadi, a 24-year-old female journalist who was investigating a disappearance case, was allegedly abducted by some armed personnel on 19 August 2015 and went missing. Her disappearance caused her younger brother to commit suicide. She was later recovered from near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in October 2017. * Five online activists: In early January 2017, five social media activists ‚Äì Salman Haider, Ahmad Waqass Goraya, Aasim Saeed, and Ahmad Raza Naseer ‚Äì went missing from different parts of Pakistan. Salman Haider was also a poet and academic. However, after few days, all of the bloggers returned to their homes. Their families confirmed their return and reported that all of the bloggers were unharmed. Founder of Aware Girls, Gulalai Ismail, was threatened with death by the Inter-Services Intelligence after she joined the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement and protested against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings by the Pakistani state. After raising awareness of sexual assault committed by Pakistani security forces on women, Gulalai Ismail fled the country as police forces were on their way to arrest her. People who have at any point gone missing *Masood Ahmed Janjua (Husband of Amina Masood Janjua) * Safdar Sarki * Saud Memon * Aafia Siddique and her three children * Hafiz Abdul Basit * Muzaffar Bhutto Some have reported to have been handed over to the CIA and/or flown to Bagram, Afghanistan and later shipped off to Guantanamo Bay. Reports of forced abductions by the Pakistani state first began arising in 2001, in the aftermath of the United States invasion of Afghanistan and the commencement of the US-led War on Terror. Many of the missing persons are activists associated with the Baloch nationalist and Sindhi nationalist movements. Balochistan According to Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) around 528 Baloch have gone missing from 2001 to 2017. A senior Pakistani provincial security official claims that missing person figures are 'exaggerated', that 'in Balochistan, insurgents, immigrants who fled to Europe and even those who have been killed in military operations are declared as missing persons'. Reports have shown that many people have fled the province to seek asylum in other countries because of the unrest caused by separatist militants. Similarly separatist militants have also been found responsible for enforced disappearances cases. Separatist militants usually wear military uniform while carrying out their militant activities. Hence they often get mistaken as security officials. As of 2018, the Pakistani state was using Islamist militants to crush Baloch separatists. Academics and journalists in the United States have been approached by Inter-Services Intelligence spies, who threatened them not to speak about the insurgency in Balochistan, as well as human rights abuses by the Pakistani Army, or else their families would be harmed.  Criticism The cases of forced disappearances were criticized by human rights organizations and the media. They have urged the government of Pakistan to probe these incidents. In 2011, a Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances was formed, but there was little progress in the investigation.

In the Khanty epics, the menk are presented as \\"formidable forest spirits\\". The Hero-Prince typically inflicts many \\"pseudo-deaths\\" on a menk until he is able to inflict a \\"total death\\".

It is identified as a \\"tree moss\\" due to its distinctive morphological features, and has four species identified across the Northern Hemisphere. The species name \\"dendroides\\" describes the tree-like morphology of the plant, and its genus name came from the structure of the perforations of peristome teeth. This plant was identified by Weber and Mohr in 1804. They often have stems that are around 2-10 cm tall and growing in the form of patches, looking like small palm-trees. They have yellow-green branches at the tip of stems. The leaves are around 2.5-3 mm long, with rounder stem leaves and pointier branch leaves. Their sporophytes are only abundant in late winter and early spring, and appears as a red-brown shoot with long stalk and cylindrical capsules. Habitat and range This species mostly dominate in moist and damp regions such as swamps, peatland and lake edges, as well as humus-rich woods, areas where water fluctuates periodically. They can be terrestrial or dominating woods and logs, they rarely grow on rocks and regions that lack moisture. They are often found in sea-level to subalpine elevations and in alpine tundras. This species is relatively widespread but not common, they are found in northern to central Europe and Asia, the South Island of New Zealand, and North America. In North America, it can be found in the Northeastern region above 45¬∞N, and as south as the Western regions of New Mexico. They can also be found in some regions in Asia, like Japan and Korea.  Description  The colour of this plant is dark green to yellow, and they can be glossy as well when they are dry. They also have separate stem and branch leaves with different structure. The stem leaves appears to have an obtuse apex, flatter against the stem and broader then the branch leaves. They are not pleated and near insertion area they contain multiple laminal cells. Their insertions are well-spaced and all have round tips. For the branch leaves, they are narrower and has a toothed margin near the tip with longitudinal folds. They have a similar shape with the stem leaves, both are egg-shaped but branch leaves are narrower. They have elongated leaf cells, and around the basal angles the stem and branch leaves contain enlarge hyaline cells with thin walls. The leaves are around 2.5-3 mm long in size. The arrangement of leaves gives the plant a palm tree-like appearance, with 2-3 cm tall stems arising from prostrate primary stems that looks like rhizomes. The attachment region of branch leaves to stem appears flat and continuous with the leaf outline, it is round to cordate and auriculate from the flexion of the margins. The stems are reddish- brown and can be short in dry areas, they appear tree-like in areas with plenty of moisture. The upright stems contains small green filaments, and the branched horizontal stems is where the tree-like structure (2-10cm) grows out from. Their capsules are upright and oblong-cylindric, ranging from 1.5-4 mm, they are quite rare to encounter since male plants are more rare than female ones.  Life cycle  In contrast with vascular plants that only has two sets of chromosomes (diploid), bryophytes are known to have a haploid generation with a single set of chromosomes, this happens in the sporophyte stage of their life cycle. The life-cycle starts with a haploid spore that germinates to produce a protonema, which are thread-like filaments or thalloid. Protonema is a combination of chloronema, caulonema and rhizoids. Chloronema are usually first formed, they are irregularly branched, has transverse crosswalls that are not pigmented, and round chloroplasts with no buds forming yet. Later on, the caulonema forms that are regularly branched, has pigmented and oblique crosswalls, spindle-shaped chloroplasts and has buds forming. Rhizoids are also present here, it helps the gametophyte that forms later on to attach to its substrate. The protonema then produces the gametophore that is structurally differentiated into stems and leaves, one or more gametophores can be formed from a single protonema. The gametophyte is formed from the caulonema buds and they undergo mitosis to produce haploid sex gametes (sperm and eggs). The gametophores also produce specialized sexual structures that houses the sperm and eggs on separate gametophytes (since Climacium dendroides are diocious). The female structure produced is called the archegonia and are surrounded by a group of modified leaves known as the perichaetum. The archegonia are small flask-shaped structure with a neck-like structure called the venter down which the male sperm swim to the enclosed female eggs. This is also where fertilization occurs. The male structures are known as antheridia and are protected by modified leaves called the perigonium. Fertilization will occur with the aid of water, sperm will be transported from antheridia to archegonia and travel down its venter to reach the egg, where fertilization will happen. Producing a diploid sporophyte. The sperm is biflagellate, they have two flagellae that aid in propulsion. The immature sporophyte then grows out from the archegonial venter. A sporophyte contains a seta (that holds up the sporangium), a capsule with an operculum cap, and a coat enclosing the capsule called the calyptra that grew from the venter of archegonia and is the only haploid structure in sporophyte. When the sporophyte is fully mature the calyptra falls off and reveals the peristome teeth within. Meiosis occurs in the sporangium and haploid spores are produced and released through the control of peristome teeth. The spores are usually carried by the wind to their new substrate where the life cycle repeats again.  Reproduction  Sporophytes are not often found except during late winter and early spring near areas with plenty of moisture. The short cylindric capsules of this species often mature in the fall. This species is known to have a diocious gametophore (having male and female gametophores on different plants. They have a long seta with sporangium at the terminal end. The spores are released when the operculum dehisces and can be aided via hygroscopic dehiscence. They also contain peristome teeth that controls the release of the spores. The spores are unicellular.  In culture  Climacium dendroides was named Moss of the Year in 2017 by the Latvian Botanists' Association. Similar species * Leucolepis acanthoneuron also has a miniature tree-like structure but does not arise from a creeping shoot. They have whitish and narrowly triangular stem leaves whereas for Climacium they have green and heart-shaped stem leaves. For Leucolepis their sporophytes are frequent in spring and has a nodding sporangia, compared to erect sporangia for Climacium.

It publishes print books and electronic literature, specialising in more experimental works. It also publishes a number of periodicals, as well as critical works. Literary scholar Dr Kenneth Keating argues that New Binary Press has been one of the first to \\"explicitly [cross] the division between online and print publishing in Irish poetry in a more progressive fashion\\". Irish poet Matthew Geden has also noted the role which New Binary Press plays within contemporary publishing: \\"...the press has published books by a number of new and interesting writers who are for one reason or another outside the current mainstream of Irish literature. Such projects are vital at a time when the poetry world here has been dominated by only a handful of presses and individuals. The emergence of new voices owes much to small publishers like New Binary and others...\\".  History  New Binary Press was founded in 2012 by James O'Sullivan, who stated that he founded the press because other Irish publishers were ignoring the creative potential of digital technology, and that he wanted to make \\"a real tangible contribution\\" to the literary world. The press was officially launched by Irish poet Leanne O'Sullivan at the City Library, Cork, on April 5, 2013. A similar event was held at The Teachers' Club, Parnell Square, Dublin, several days later. In an interview with Books Ireland magazine, O'Sullivan said that New Binary Press was operating at a loss, remarking that \\"the value of dissonance outweighs that of cents\\".  Publications  The press has had a number of critical successes: Graham Allen's The One That Got Away (2014) was shortlisted for the Shine/Strong Award 2015, while Unexplained Fevers (2013) by Jeannine Hall Gailey came second in the 2014 Science Fiction Poetry Association's Elgin Award. In 2016, the press published its first novel, Karl Parkinson's The Blocks, which would go on to earn considerable critical acclaim. novelling, a work of recombinant fiction by Will Luers, Hazel Smith, and Roger Dean, won the ELO's 2018 Robert Coover Award for a Work of Electronic Literature. New Binary Press has published a number of works of electronic literature, most notably by artists like Nick Montfort, Stephanie Strickland, Jason Nelson, and John Barber. The first work that New Binary Press published was digital poetry by Graham Allen, entitled Holes. The one-line-a-day semi-autobiographical narrative has been widely praised and analysed by scholars and critics. In 2017, two e-lit works published by New Binary Press, The Bafflement Fires and novelling, were shortlisted for the Turn on Literature Prize, co-funded by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union. A number of New Binary Press publications represent marked political leanings. In 2017, the press published The Elysian: Creative Responses, an anthology of poetry, short fiction, and critical essays which respond to The Elysian in Cork city, a building which Marjorie Brennan describes as a \\"a symbol of the worst excesses of the Celtic Tiger\\". Edited by Graham Allen and Billy Ramsell, the collection includes contributions by a number of notable writers and critics, including C√≥nal Creedon, Doireann N√≠ Ghr√≠ofa, and Frank McDonald. Earlier in 2017, New Binary Press released John Barber's Remembering the Dead: Northern Ireland, a Web-based commemoration of the victims of The Troubles which builds on earlier iterations intended as a response to gun violence in the US. In 2018, New Binary Press published Autonomy, edited by Kathy D'Arcy, a project which sought to raise funds in support of the campaign to repeal the Eight Amendment of the Irish Constitution, as well as contribute to the campaign for \\"safe, legal abortion\\" in Ireland.

Career  He studied the four mathematical arts of the quadrivium: arithmetic and geometry, music theory and astronomy, and philosophy and theology, beside the classical poetry and the occult sciences of magic and kabbalah. He mastered the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin languages. In his books, he has tried his best to reconcile Pythagorean doctrine with Christian theology. His major work, the Numerorum Mysteria was first published in 1591 and received an imprimatur from the Catholic Church. It explores the mystical significance of numbers, beginning with lengthy discourses on the numbers one, two and three, and continuing with shorter tracts on significant numbers later in sequence. Bongo draws on a wide range of sources, including the pagan literature and philosophy of Classical Greece and Rome, early Church Fathers and the mainstream Catholic tradition of scholarship, as well as very recent scholarship of his own day.

However, Dilip refused to make any changes, leading to Sunny shunning the movie's premiere during the Toronto International Film Festival, and going so far as not being on talking terms with the director. The official response from Sunny was that she was attending a Bar Mitzvah in New York, hence the lack of promotions. Reception Norman Wilner of Toronto's Now weekly panned the production, indicating that Mehta was \\"padding it with montages and even retelling stories in order to fill time.\\".

The rule was first enacted in 1876 and rescinded in 1983, and was reinstated in January 2017 on a temporary basis. It was in effect for the entirety of the Republican-controlled 115th Congress and several amendments were proposed that progressed to a vote of the full House, but none were adopted. The rule was rescinded once more at the beginning of the 116th Congress upon Democrats taking control of the chamber.  Effects  The rule is an exception to the prohibition against provisions in appropriations legislation that change existing law. Prior to the rule's reinstatement in 2017, cuts could be made to agencies broadly, but not to specific programs or employees. The rule was used to eliminate 29 customs positions in 1932 and another eight in 1939, to allow a provision reducing the number of naval officers in 1938, and to allow a 1952 amendment disallowing the filling of vacancies in independent agencies until the agency's workforce had been reduced by 10%. Prior to 2017, it appeared never to have been used to cut a specific worker's salary with the intent of incentivizing them to quit. The rule cannot be used if the reductions are contingent on other events, or to give broad authority to agency heads to fire workers. The constitutionality of bills passed under the Holman Rule has been questioned by legal scholars in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Lovett (1946). That case dealt with an act of Congress, passed during the Red Scare, that defunded the salaries of 39 employees accused of having Communist sympathies. The Court held that, under these circumstances, the Act was no \\"mere appropriation measure\\", but was effectively a bill of attainder prohibited by Article I, Section 9, of the Constitution.  Text  Prior to 1983, the Holman Rule was part of Rule XXI, Clause 2 of the Rules of the House of Representatives, and stated that an amendment to an appropriations bill is allowed if it, \\"being germane to the subject matter of the bill, shall retrench expenditures by the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States, by the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States, or by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill\\". The 2017 reinstatement of the law was a standing order not incorporated into the main body of the Rules of the House. It allows during the 115th Congress, \\"any provision or amendment ... that retrenches expenditures by‚Äî(1) the reduction of amounts of money in the bill; (2) the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States; or (3) the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\\"  History  William S. Holman of Indiana originated the Holman Rule in 1876. The rule was first passed in 1876, rescinded in 1895, and restored in 1911. It underwent several modifications until it reached its final state in 1911. It was named for Indiana Representative William S. Holman. It was initially used to eliminate patronage positions prior to the establishment of the merit-based employment system. It was also used for targeted cuts to, and caps on, the number and salary of federal employees, though its use was rare in modern times. It was removed in 1983 due to objections from Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill.  Revival  The rule was reinstated as part of the rules package enacted at the beginning of the 115th Congress in 2017 for a period of one year, unless extended by Congress. It was championed by Freedom Caucus member Morgan Griffith, Republican of Virginia, who favored empowering individual members of Congress to strategically reassign workers according to policy needs, and to cut programs perceived as wasteful. Republicans said that the rule change would increase accountability and streamline the appropriations process, and said they did not intend it as a broad change to the appropriations process. Democrats criticized the revival of the Holman Rule as undermining civil service protections, and allowing the possibility that specific individuals could be targeted for political reasons. Federal employee unions, such as the American Federation of Government Employees, raised similar concerns. The rule was also criticized for taking hiring decisions out of the hands of Cabinet and other members of the executive branch. Some Republicans also criticized the rule, such as Tom Cole, chairman of a House Appropriations Subcommittee. There were several attempts to use the rule in 2017 as amendments to the fiscal year 2018 appropriations bills. A proposal offered by Morgan Griffith to eliminate 89 jobs at the Congressional Budget Office failed on July 26, 2017, on a vote of 116‚Äì309. There were also two additional amendments offered by Ron DeSantis that were approved by the House Rules Committee but did not receive a floor vote: one aimed at employees working on Guantanamo Bay Naval Base policy, as well as one for a single individual at the Army Corps of Engineers. The Holman Rule was extended to the end of the 115th Congress in March 2018. In April 2018, the Republican Study Committee budget plan supported use of the rule to remove positions considered unneeded. In June 2018, Paul Gosar proposed using the rule to cut the Western Area Power Administration Administrator Mark Gabriel's salary to $1 for alleged misconduct. This amendment failed by a vote of 139‚Äì276 on June 7, 2018. The Holman Rule was removed at the beginning of the 116th United States Congress in January 2019, after Democrats had taken control of the chamber.

He joined the colonial service after the war. He was appointed to Seychelles from 1920 to 1925, Gibraltar from 1925 to 1927, Northern Rhodesia as the Chief Secretary from 1935 to 1945. He was appointed Chief Financial Advisor to the Civil Affairs Unit in Hong Kong's post-war military administration reporting to David MacDougall (Chief Civil Affairs Officer). When civilian government was restored on 1 May 1946 he was appointed Financial Secretary of Hong Kong under governor Sir Mark Young. Follows outlined his financial strategy for Hong Kong to the Legislative Council on 25 July 1946. His first objective was to facilitate a rapid recovery after the period of occupation; and his second was to be financially independent of Britain as soon as possible. He oversaw a rapid recovery in the post-war economy of Hong Kong. By running significant budget surpluses within a year of taking office, he made Hong Kong financially independent of UK government support, and in October 1948 the UK government granted Hong Kong a significant degree of financial independence. Follows introduced the Inland Revenue Bill (1947) which made the temporary pre-war introduction of income tax permanent. In budget forecasting he established a tradition of conservatism, with revenues usually underestimated and costs usually overestimated versus out-turns. Subsequent Financial Secretaries were to adopt the same approach. He gave his last budget in the spring of 1951. He left Hong Kong on pre-retirement leave in May 1951.

Japan's Korean War 1592‚Äì98 (London, 2002), Cassell & Co , p. 72  Background  In 1592, Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Korea, intending to use it as a route to send his armies to conquer Ming China. His forces achieved early success against the Korean army, capturing Seoul. Attempting to reach Seoul as fast as possible, the Japanese forces bypassed Jeolla Province. The governor of Jeolla, Yi Gwang, decided to lead his forces against the Japanese in a counterattack. Turnbull, Stephen: Samurai Invasion.

Yi Gwang led a force of 80,000-130,000 men against it.  Course of battle  Against Kwon Yul's warnings and advice, Yi Kwang launched an attack without making a reconnaissance. One group of the Korean army took up positions on a hill, while the other attacked the fortress itself. Wakisaka's forces counterattacked, and destroyed the Korean army through an ambush. Turnbull, Stephen: Samurai Invasion. Japan's Korean War 1592‚Äì98 (London, 2002), Cassell & Co , p. 72  Result  Many of the Korean officers were captured by the Japanese in the battle. Nevertheless, Gwon Yul and Hwang Jin retreated in good order and were able to gather surviving scattered troops for the victory at the Battle of Ichi. Thus, Jeolla remained outside Japanese control for the rest of the first Japanese invasion of Korea. On the other hand, the defeat of Yongin (along with the defeat at the Imjin River) convinced King Seonjo to abandon Pyeongyang and evacuate to Uiju. Although the Korean troops would eventually retake Seoul after winning a decisive victory at Hangju in 1593, the Koreans would never field an army of 80,000~100,000 at one point for the remaining of the war.

The station was opened on 15 March 1844 with the Altenburg‚ÄìCrimmitschau section by the Saxon-Bavarian Railway Company (S√§chsisch-Baiersche Eisenbahn-Compagnie).  History On 1 July 1841, work began on the construction of the Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway, the first section of which opened to Altenburg on 19 September 1842. The section to G√∂√ünitz and Crimmitschau was opened to on 15 March 1844 and the rest of the line was opened on 15 July 1851. The first G√∂√ünitz station building was a wooden building, which was replaced by a new building with the opening of the Glauchau‚ÄìG√∂√ünitz railway on 15 November 1858. The G√∂√ünitz‚ÄìGera railway was opened on 28 December 1865. The construction of the third station building took place in 1893. In G√∂√ünitz there was a water tower with high tanks and water cranes for steam locomotives. These facilities were no longer needed after the railway line from Leipzig to Reichenbach was electrified in 1962/63. The demolition of the water tower, the freight shed as well as the north wing of the stately heritage-listed station building in Neo-Baroque style began in 2007. Three years later demolition of the rest of the building followed. Since then, the town has been trying to find a solution because the site belongs to Deutsche Bahn and it does not see any need for further action after the demolition. In 2013, a bus loop and some parking lots were erected in front of the railway station. G√∂√ünitz has been integrated in the network of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland since 15 December 2013.  Platforms Platforms in G√∂√ünitz G√∂√ünitz station was built with an extra long platform to allow several trains to be run from the platform in different directions simultaneously. A sign at the station indicates that the station has the longest platform in Germany at 608 metres. It is also listed in the station register of DB Station&Service; as having a construction length of 608 metres. The useful length of the platform is shown as only 435 metres. G√∂√ünitz does not actually have the longest platform in Germany. In the stations of Mainz (706.5 metres), Essen (667 metres), Hamburg (627 metres) and Zittau (347 + 287 metres) there are platforms with a larger structural length than that in G√∂√ünitz.  Passenger services  History  Until the 2000/2001 timetable, G√∂√ünitz was a stop for long-distance passenger traffic. The last long-distance services in G√∂√ünitz were the Interregio 2792 (Munich Hbf‚ÄìLeipzig Hbf) and the D-Zug 2793 (Leipzig‚ÄìMunich). G√∂√ünitz station is also an important hub for east Thuringian and west Saxon passenger services. Portions of regional trains were attached and detached in G√∂√ünitz between December 2002 and June 2014. A portion of Regional-Express service 1, coming from Erfurt, continued via Werdau to Zwickau, while the other portion operated via Meerane to Glauchau. From December 2011, the train continued from Glauchau to Chemnitz and connected the two Saxon centres with the long-distance service node of Erfurt. The service to Zwickau was abandoned as part of the restructuring of regional services with the opening of the City Tunnel.  Current Status: summer 2016 timetable In the 2015/2016 timetable, the station is serviced by lines S5 and S5X of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland, which was put into operation in December 2013 with the opening of the City Tunnel Leipzig. The line S5 service has been running every hour since December 2015 from Halle via Leipzig/Halle Airport, Leipzig Hbf to Altenburg, and from here continuing via G√∂√ünitz and Werdau to Zwickau. The S5 is supplemented by an hourly express service on line S5X, which starts at Leipzig/Halle Airport but does not serve all stations. Since December 2013 the S5X replaces the former Regional-Express services RE 8 (Leipzig‚ÄìZwickau) and RE 16 (Leipzig‚ÄìHof/Bad Brambach) and Regionalbahn, S5 replaces the previous regional service RB 130 (Leipzig‚ÄìAltenburg‚ÄìG√∂√ünitz‚ÄìZwickau/Glauchau) since then. The second important connection runs from Thuringia. A service using tilting diesel-multiple units of class 612 runs from G√∂ttingen via Erfurt, Jena-G√∂schwitz, Gera and G√∂√ünitz, continuing via Meerane to Glauchau. To and from Meerane, the Regional-Express running every two hours is supplemented by the RB 37 service, operated by Erzgebirgsbahn, which connects G√∂√ünitz and Glauchau and the two services together produces an approximately hourly service.

Born in Paris from a large family of artists (musicians, conductors, performers, actors, composers, painters, and writers), he has composed more than a hundred of musical creations for television, cinema, performances, and theatre. In his early years, he started out as an artistic director for EMI Classics, then set out to create music for the stage (1983-1997). From 1984 on, he started writing music for TV and cinema, with a style combining the elegance of orchestral music and the effects of electronics (synthetizers and computer music). Greco Casadesus composed soundtracks for very diverse productions, such as Divertimento, with Kellan Lutz, Torrey DeVitto, Ola Rapace, G√∂tz Otto by Keyvan Sheikhalishahi, The Climb, a fiction movie by the American director Bob Swaim, the animated film Babar,King of the elephants, adapted from the classic French comic by Jean de Brunhof, or the TV series Jesus by Serge Moati. He even wrote seven hours of music for the restored version of the 1921 masterpiece Les Trois Mousquetaires, by Henri Diamant- Berger. Fascinated by the genius of Etienne-Jules Marey (1830-1904), inventor of the first moving images, he wrote in 2008 the symphonic suite Sept Mouvements de Vie, performed by an orchestra as images by Marey were projected on a film screen. More recently, he composed the music score for several documentary films, such as La Guerre d'Hollywood, Jack London, une aventure am√©ricaine, or the TV series Jusqu'au dernier. In 2002, he founded the Union des Compositeurs de Musiques de Films (UCMF), a lobbying group defending the interests of music creators. He remained its president until 2005, and then its honorary chairman. In 2003, Greco Casadesus was nominated \\"Personality of the year\\" by the trade journal Musique Info Hebdo. In 2012 he was awarded the Henri-Langlois Award.  Biography   Early life and education  Gr√©co Casadesus grew up in a family of artists.., his father, Marius Casadesus (1892-1981), being a violinist and a composer, and his mother, Gladys Thibaud (1928), a pianist. As an heir of generations of artists and musicians, he started studying music with his parents, learning the violin at age 3 with his father, and piano at age 5 with his mother. He grew up in Montmartre (Casadesus Square), in Paris, and from 9 years old, studied at the Conservatoire de Paris, training 8 hours a day, which earned him the First Medal in theory, as well as a Prize in piano at the Versailles Conservatory. He started his career at age 22 as an artistic director at EMI Classics, where he had over 200 albums recorded, with masters such as Mstislav Rostropovitch, Leonard Bernstein and Georges Pr√™tre. While in contact with these artists, he broadened his musical language and orchestration style. By age 30, he wrote and recorded his first album, Voyage immobile, but after his second album, Les Oiseaux de rivi√®re noire (1982), he decided to focus on what he liked best, music scores for cinema and for the stage.  Composing for the stage and for images  Greco Casadesus then got interested in the way music can influence the process of writing and directing a film or a play. His first experiences in theatre and the strong working relation he enjoyed with the two stage directors allowed him to explore new sounds, for example using new electronics sounds and synthetizers that had just appeared in the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1983 and 1997, he composed no less than 22 musical creations for the stage, mainly for Jean Danet's Les Tr√©teaux de France theatre company and the Th√©√¢tre du Marais of Jacques Mauclair. In particular, he composed the music for the classic Moli√®re play L'Avare, which was awarded a prestigious Moli√®re Award in 1989 for the direction by Mauclair Greco Casadesus was then contacted by the American film director Bob Swaim, who hired him in 1997 to replace the famous composer John Barry and write the soundtrack for his feature film, The Climb, with John Hurt, Gregory Smith and David Strathairn. In 1998, he innovated by composing the very first original soundtrack for Marie et le vin, a book by Claire Huynen published by √âditions du Cherche-Midi. The following year, Greco Casadesus wrote the soundtrack for the cartoon Babar, King of the elephants, by Canadian director Raymond Jafelice. In 1999, he wrote the score for an important TV project, J√©sus, directed by Serge Moati. It was a huge success, reaching an audience of 10 million viewers during its unique broadcast, on Dec. 25 1999, on France's main television channel. In 2001, he wrote seven hours of music for the restored version of the 1921 film Les Trois Mousquetaires, an adaptation of the great French classic by Alexandre Dumas. Following this experience, he produced a live performance designed for children, entitled Les Trois Mousquetaires font du Cin√©ma, a production mixing theatre, cinema and musical theatre.  Leading large projects  Being so passionate about his trade, Greco Casadesus gained some leadership among French composers, which lead him to found in 2002 the French association of composers, Union des Compositeurs de Musiques de Films (UCMF). He spearheaded it until 2005, with an aim to promote and protect a profession in a changing environment. Nowadays, he is UCMF's Honorary Chairman, along with Bernard Grimaldi. Greco Casadesus then founded the production and publishing company Opus Mill√©sime, and produced a film and a CD as a tribute to his cousin, the pianist and composer Robert Casadesus (1899-1972). In January 2004, he was nominated \\"Personality of the year\\" by the music magazine Musique Info Hebdo. During the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, Greco Casadesus' symphony Sept Mouvements de Vie, dedicated to the life and work of the photographer √âtienne- Jules Marey, was played by the Orchestre R√©gional de Cannes Provence-Alpes- C√¥te d'Azur, conducted by Philippe Bender. Still inspired by Marey's chronophotographies, he wrote the missing movements of his symphony in 2008. The resulting ¬´ concert of images ¬ª, using Marey's antique photos edited by director Sylvie-Jeanne Gander, was performed at the Dijon film festival, Rencontres cin√©matographiques de Dijon. This symphonical suite was published by Cezame Music Agency with the title Movements of Life, and a series of three films about the Marey project was released the following year. This project initiated a vibrant collaboration with the music label Cezame, run by Fr√©d√©ric Leibovitz and Fran√ßoise Marchesseau, resulting in the publication of over 200 of his music tracks over the years.  Composing for documentary films  Greco Casadesus entered a new phase of collaborations, with the composition of soundtracks for various documentary films in France, in particular for directors Christian Zerbib (En terre √©trang√®re and Nos anc√™tres les Gauloises), Michel Viotte (La guerre d'Hollywood et Jack London, une aventure am√©ricaine), and William Karel (Jusqu'au dernier : La destruction des Juifs d'Europe). This last project was inspired by the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau's Nazi camp. For this project, he composed several orchestral scores to be played the famous American clarinetist David Krakauer. \\"Shouting the infinity and never hearing it. Shouting an intimate pain, in silence. Giving a chance to hope, even if it is slim. Translating an unspeakable feeling that neither words nor images can express. Keeping a low profile. This was I was after,\\" Greco Casadesus said when his work was published in the album, David Krakauer plays Greco Casadesus. His work with Krakauer was also followed by a show at the French radio studios, France Musique. Both the soundtrack for the three TV films produced for this documentary project, and the Krakauer album, were published by C√©zame  Training the next generation  Greco Casadesus was awarded the Henri- Langlois Award for his career in 2012, and as a reference in the field of scoring, and he is often requested to speak about the specificity of composing for images. \\"As a foundation for this complex mix between image and music, the composer has a tremendous power that is balanced by a potential and terrible sanction : as beautiful as the music he just wrote can be, if it doesn't fit the director's purpose, it will be discarded ! \\" he says during his lectures, master-classes and training workshops. One example of this training activities is the Music Score Lab (\\"Le laboratoire de musique de films\\"), which he created in 2013 along with Cristal Productions and the La Rochelle TV film festival (Festival de la fiction TV de La Rochelle). This yearly training allows selected composers to compose a soundtrack for a film sequence, and gives way to a small concert, with an orchestra playing in front of an audience the music composed by the trainees, synchronized with the images. From 2013 to 2015, Greco Casadesus has also been heading the Sacem's TV Commission (Commission de l'Audiovisuel).  Works  Greco Casadesus has written a hundred of original scores for theatre, film, television, concerts and other stage performances. He also has ventured into film production. = Albums = Thanks to a solid classic training and a passion for recording techniques and new technologies, Greco Casadesus a developed his own style, mixing acoustic instruments and electronic sound effects. During his career, he has focused on recording, in collaboration with his friends in the publishing world, Jean Claudel, founder of the label Amplitude, and Fr√©d√©ric Leibovitz, founder of C√©zame Music Agency. Since 2008, he has contributed to various albums from Cezame's catalogue (Marines, Seascapes, American Road Book, Paysages avec cordes, Motivation & Inspiration, Historical Heritage, 1914 : La grande guerre, Sense and Sensibility, Inspiring Cinematic Choirs, Western, Scandal & Gossip, Freaky Frolics) * 1980 : Voyage immobile * 1982 : Les oiseaux de rivi√®re noire * 1986 : Carte blanche √† Greco Casadesus * 1995 : Projections * 1997 : The Climb * 1998 : Marie et le vin (Un roman et sa musique) * 1999 : Babar, king of the elephants * 2003 : Symphonic Nirvana * 2005 : Les Trois Mousquetaires * 2009 : Suppl√©ments d'√¢me * 2015 : David Krakauer plays Greco Casadesus * 2016 : Movements of Life = Theatre = Greco Casadesus dedicated 14 years of his life to the stage, and has made a great contribution to theatre, thanks to his collaboration with theatre directors Jean Danet and Jacques Mauclair, respectively founders of Pantin's company, Les Tr√©teaux de France, and the Th√©√¢tre du Marais. * 1983 : The Cherry Orchard, by Anton Tchekhov, for Tr√©teaux de France. * 1983 : Exit the King, by Eug√®ne Ionesco, for Th√©√¢tre du Marais * 1984 : Androcles and the Lion, by George Bernard Shaw, for Th√©√¢tre du Marais * 1984 : Marshall, nous voil√†! by Bruno Laurent, for Th√©√¢tre du Sentier des Halles * 1986 : Bajazet, by Racine, for Carr√© Silvia Montfort * 1986 : La com√©die sans titre, by Italo Svevo, for Th√©√¢tre du Marais * 1987 : Britannicus, by Racine, for Carr√© Silvia Montfort * 1987 : It's a Family Affair-We'll Settle It Ourselves, by Alexander Ostrovski, for Th√©√¢tre du Marais * 1987 : Guillaume ou les Quatre saisons d'un conqu√©rant, by Jean-Pierre Nortel, for Tr√©teaux de France * 1988 : The Lark (L'Alouette), by Jean Anouilh, for Tr√©teaux de France * 1988 : The Prince of Homburg, by Heinrich von Kleist, for Th√©√¢tre Mouffetard * 1989 : L'Avare (The Miser)', by Moli√®re, for Th√©√¢tre du Marais * 1989 : Le Mariage de Figaro, by Beaumarchais, for Tr√©teaux de France * 1990 : La Guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu (The Trojan War Will Not Take Place), by Jean Giraudoux, for Tr√©teaux de France * 1991 : Each In His Own Way, by Luigi Pirandello, for Tr√©teaux de France * 1991 : Laetitia, by Peter Shaffer, for Th√©√¢tre du Rond-Point * 1992 : Tartuffe, by Moli√®re, for Tr√©teaux de France * 1993 : L'Aiglon, by Edmond Rostand, for Tr√©teaux de France * 1995 : Lorenzaccio, by Alfred de Musset, for Tr√©teaux de France * 1995 : Christmas at the Cupiello's, by Eduardo de Filippo, for Th√©√¢tre du Marais * 1997 : Une r√©p√©tition au th√©√¢tre du crime, by Jacques Mauclair, for Th√©√¢tre du Marais  Television and Film  From his friendship with Roger Boutry, conductor of the Symphonic Orchestra of the Republican Guard, appeared in 1984 an opportunity to compose for a TV series on the French gendarmerie. This first experience led to numerous TV projects for all French channels : SFP, TF1, A2, FR3, France 3, France 5. His film career includes a large diversity of genres, feature films, series, documentary films, as well as short films. His meeting with directors such as Bob Swaim, Etienne Perier, Serge Moati, J√©r√¥me Diamant-Berger and others, have expanded his skills in film scoring. He composed the first third movies of young French filmmaker Keyvan Sheikhalishahi, Vesper with G√∂tz Otto, Nox with Matt Passmore and Brigitte Millar, and Divertimento, with Kellan Lutz, Torrey DeVitto, Ola Rapace, G√∂tz Otto, Christian Hillborg, Ellie Heydon. 1984 - 1985 : L'homme au k√©pi noir (TV series) 1984 : Andr√© Moleux, peintre, by G√©rard Sergues 1985 : Maestro, by Serge Korber 1985 : Tant qu'il y aura des cerfs, by Laurent Charbonnier 1986 : Fred Connexion, by Serge Korber 1986 : Les conqu√©rants de l'impossible : portrait de groupe, by Bernard Choquet and Bernard Dumont 1986 : Chinook, by Christian Zuccarelli 1987 : Cord√©e canine, by Christian Zuccarelli 1987 : Nuit d'enfer, by Philippe Guillaume 1988 - 1989 : Myst√®res et bulles de gomme, by Bernard Dumont (TV series) 1989 to 1994 : Intrigues, m√©saventures, passion, c√¥t√© c≈ìur (TV series) 1990 : Appelez-moi Tonton, by Dominique Baron 1992 : La mont√©e au pouvoir des femmes, by Ghislaine Guide 1992 : C√©r√©monie religieuse, by Bernard Dumont 1992 : Le passage du Nord-Ouest, by Bernard Dumont 1993 : Le poids du corps, by Christine Fran√ßois 1993 : Les d√©ratisseurs, by Bernard Dumont 1993 : Meurtre √† ciel ouvert, by Jean-Marc Seban 1994 : Meurtre √† l'universit√©, by Jean-Marc Seban 1995 : Le silence de Lesbos, by Ghislaine Guidez 1995 : Les louves, by Jean-Marc Seban 1995 : Un mort sur le pav√©, by Jean-Marc Seban 1995 : Le Match de notre vie. by Gareth Davies 1996 : So It Is (If You Think So), by Luigi Pirandello 1996 : La Rumeur, by √âtienne P√©rier 1996 : La passe-montagne, by Jean-Marc Seban 1997 : The Climb, by Bob Swaim 1998 : Babar, King of the elephants, by Raymond Jafelice 1998 : Les legs, by Bernard Dumont 1998 : Le dernier fils, by √âtienne P√©rier 2000 : L'Enfant de la honte, by Claudio Tonetti 2000 : Que reste-t-il..., by √âtienne P√©rier 2000 : La vie √† plein temps, by Serge Moati 2001 : J√©sus, by Serge Moati 2001 : Les Trois Mousquetaires, by Henri Diamant-Berger 2009 : En terre √©trang√®re. by Christian Zerbib 2010 : Petit creux (s√©rie TV, 104 √©pisodes) 2011 √† 2013 : Le quiz de Zack (TV series) 2011 : Nos anc√™tres les Gauloises, by Christian Zerbib 2013 : La Guerre d'Hollywood, by Michel Viotte 2014 : Jusqu'au dernier, by William Karel 2015 : Ta M√®re! by Touria Benzari 2016 : La face, by Marc Rivi√®re 2017 : Vesper, by Keyvan Sheikhalishahi 2019: Nox by Keyvan Sheikhalishahi 2020: Divertimento, by Keyvan Sheikhalishahi  References   External links  * Official site (in French): http://www.greco-casadesus.com/ * http://www.notrecinema.com/communaute/stars/stars.php3?staridx=75594 1951 births Living people Musicians from Paris Conservatoire de Paris alumni French film score composers ","title":"Gr√©co Casadesus"},{"id":"52868100","text":"Berland River is a stream in Alberta, Canada.

Bette Midler version (unreleased) When the song was newly written its writers Michael Masser and Gerry Goffin personally pitched \\"Someone That I Used to Love\\" to Brooks Arthur at the Record Plant where Arthur was overseeing production of the 1977 Bette Midler album Broken Blossom: Arthur, feeling the song would be a surefire hit single for Midler, first called the singer in to the studio to hear the song, and then with Midler's endorsement Arthur called in arranger Artie Butler to orchestrate for a recording session.

Arthur was happy with the finished track, feeling it had the hit potential of his one previous mega-success: the 1975 hit \\"At Seventeen\\" by Janis Ian; however (Brooks Arthur quote:) \\"I get a call a couple of days later from Bette [at around] two, three, four in the morning, and she says: 'I don't want to release the song...My manager Aaron Russo didn't feel the album needed another gushy ballad, it needed more energy.' ...We [argued] until four, five, six, seven in the morning - we did this for about two days straight.\\" Eventually Russo solicited Atlantic Records honcho Ahmet Ertegun to side with him against the release of \\"Someone That I Used to Love\\": Arthur would recall Ertegun opining that the track should be replaced by a high-spirited number along the lines of Midler's first two singles \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\" and \\"Friends\\", and ultimately \\"Someone That I Used to Love\\" was dropped in favor of a new recording made by Midler of the 1954 Sarah Vaughn hit \\"Make Yourself Comfortable\\".

The first single from Cole not produced by Chuck Jackson and Marvin Yancy, \\"Someone That I Used to Love\\" afforded Cole a considerable comeback reaching #21 on the Billboard Hot 100 where she had last ranked with the 1977-78 Top Ten hit \\"Our Love\\": however she would again be absent from the Hot 100 until 1985 and not reappear in the Top 40 until 1987. \\"Someone That I Used to Love\\" also peaked at #21 on the Billboard R&B; chart and is therefore not among Cole's biggest R&B; hits: the track did afford Cole her first Top Ten Adult Contemporary hit (#3).

Maeda is a Japanese geneticist and medical researcher, who works on complex human diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes and high blood pressure, and is particularly known for creating the first mouse model for atherosclerosis. Maeda has worked in the United States since 1978; as of 2017, she is the Robert H. Wagner Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Early life and education Maeda was born in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan in the early 1950s, the second of three sisters. Her father was a chemical engineering professor. She attended Tohoku University in Sendai, where she received a BSc in chemistry (1972) and an MSc in bio-organic chemistry (1974), followed by a PhD in the same subject in 1977; her thesis was entitled \\"Isolation and characterization of neurotoxins from the venoms of sea snakes, and the use of amino acid sequences in taxonomy\\". Career and awards Maeda first briefly worked in the laboratory of Nobuo Tamiya at the Department of Chemistry of Tohoku University. In 1978, she left Japan for the United States, and worked for a decade at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. She held post-doctoral positions in the laboratories of Walter M. Fitch (Department of Physiological Chemistry; 1978‚Äì81) and Oliver Smithies (Laboratory of Genetics; 1981‚Äì83), and then worked in the Laboratory of Genetics as an assistant and then associate scientist. She moved to the Department of Pathology of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1988, with her collaborator (and later husband) Smithies, where she held successively positions as associate professor (1988) and professor (1996), and was appointed the Robert H. Wagner Distinguished Professor at the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine in 2003. She is also an adjunct professor in the Department of Nutrition (from 2000) and has directed the university's pre-doctoral training program in vascular biology since 2002. She was awarded the Method to Extend Research in Time (MERIT) Award of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (1998). Human apolipoprotein E Research Maeda's early work on sea snake venoms led to an interest in molecular evolution, which she pursued in Fitch's laboratory. She published in the 1980s on molecular evolution in higher primates such as chimpanzees and humans. Her work focused on the large mutational effects of recombination between members of multigene families, particularly in the human haptoglobin gene cluster. In 1987, Maeda, Smithies and coworkers used the novel technique of gene targeting ‚Äì a method of replacing single mouse genes using homologous recombination developed by Smithies, Mario Capecchi and others ‚Äì to correct the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene responsible for Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome in mouse cells in vitro. This was the second successful use of the technique to be published. Maeda then started to apply gene targeting to elucidate the function of lipoproteins, which had been shown by Jan and Judith Rapacz to be associated with atherosclerosis in domestic pigs. She was one of the first to apply gene-targeting methods to a complex, multifactorial disease, rather than single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis and Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome. Maeda and her coworkers found that deleting the mouse gene for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ‚Äì a component of very low- density lipoprotein ‚Äì caused the animals to develop elevated blood cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis within around 6 months, on a normal diet. The results were published in 1992, in a highly cited paper in Science. The ApoE knockout (apoe‚àí/‚àí) was the earliest mouse model of the disease, and has been widely used in atherosclerosis research. Oliver Smithies, Maeda's husband and long-term collaborator Maeda's group subsequently carried out other gene- targeting experiments, including replacing the mouse gene for ApoE with common variants of the human gene. As of 2017, her research continues to focus on atherosclerosis, and encompasses molecular pathology as well as genetics. She also researches other multifactorial diseases, including diabetes and high blood pressure. Personal life Maeda was married to the British-born geneticist Oliver Smithies (1925‚Äì2017).

He was the first Labour Officer of Hong Kong and Financial Secretary of Hong Kong from 1939 to 1941. Biography Butters was born in Glasgow, Scotland on 11 April 1898. He was educated at the Glasgow High School and won a scholarship to the Glasgow University in 1916. He joined the Eastern cadetship and was appointed to Hong Kong in 1922. He served as District Officer North, Assistant Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Deputy Clerk of Councils and Assistant Colonial Secretary. He was appointed police magistrate on five occasions in the New Territories, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. He also took the law examinations and was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn. In 1934 Governor Sir William Peel singled him out for praise in the Legislative Council for his work on the budget. Butters was appointed by Sir Geoffrey Northcote the first Labour Officer of Hong Kong when the Hong Kong government was under pressure from London to give attention to the Chinese child labour. Butters completed a comprehensive study entitled Report on Labour and Labour Conditions in Hong Kong, the first report in Hong Kong labour history. In the report, Butters argued for more support of the workers and prosed the expansion of labour welfare legislations to include a variety of occupational diseases in the proposed Workmen's Compensation Ordinance. He also acknowledged the prevalence of tuberculosis and the problem of opium or heroin addiction among the working poor. He drafted two bills, a Trade Union Ordinance and a Trade Boards Ordinance, in which the latter was passed in 1940 but the earlier was not enacted. In December 1939, he succeeded Sydney Caine as the second Financial Secretary of Hong Kong. During his tenure, he amended the Wall Revenue Ordinance to raise revenue in the preparation for the Japanese aggression. He went on leave in 1941, travelling to America and returned to Hong Kong in November, five weeks before the Japanese invasion. He was one of the civilian defenders during the Battle of Hong Kong in 1941 and was interned in the Stanley Internment Camp. Butters was sent home to recuperate after the war and Geoffrey Follows arrived as financial advisor to the military administration, who later replaced him as the Financial Secretary. He was subsequently assigned to Nyasaland and Colonial Office in 1947 as assistant secretary to head the Finance Department. He retired in 1949 at the age of 50. Butters married Jean Bain in 1926 and had two daughters and a son. He died in Stirling, Scotland on 1 March 1985 at the age of 86.

The Koreans won this battle and stopped the Japanese army from advancing to the Jeolla province.  Background  Toyotomi Hideyoshi made an order to Kobayakawa Takakage to attack the Jeolla Province. Jeolla Province was famous for it rice, and Japan needed that rice to feed their army. Also, Admiral Yi Sun-sin's naval force was stationed in Jeolla Province. Capturing Jeolla Province would provide a land route for the Japanese army to attack Admiral Yi, who had interfered with Japanese supply lines for the past two months. So Kobayakawa, who was in Seoul at the time, advanced to attack the Korean army.  Flow of the battle  Japanese army needed to go from Geumsan County to Jeonju to capture the province. There were two paths that the Japanese could take. One path was blocked by a hill called Ungchi and the other was blocked by Ichi hill. The Japanese split their forces and so did the Koreans. So the battle for Ichi and Ungchi happened at the same time. At the same time, Ko Kyong-myong was advancing to Geumsan to try to trap the Japanese. Although force at Ichi were winning by the 8th, Korean force at Ungchi routed to Jeonju at that time and the Japanese force advanced to Jeonju by that path. However, later on, Japanese force retreated from Ichi and Jeonju. Ko Kyong-myong force has arrived and was attacking the Japanese rear.

It was the first prison in South Australia to be built outside of the state capital, Adelaide. The gaol was built in 1856. It was reported in January 1866 that it contained no prisoners, despite being an active prison. In 1871, it was gazetted as the place of confinement for persons arrested on warrants from the Local Courts of Redruth, Clare, Riverton and Auburn, with Georgetown added in 1874. In 1876, it had problems with overcrowding, with 22 prisoners in a total of only eight cells. It was reported in 1879, at the time of the construction of the Old Gladstone Gaol, that Redruth was too small and in a poor state of repair. By 1894, Redruth Gaol had again received little use for some time, and was costing ¬£370 per annum despite holding only three prisoners; as such, the decision was made to close the prison in that year. Prisoners north of Burra were sent to Gladstone, while prisoners south of Burra were sent to Adelaide. It was reopened as a girls reformatory in 1897. The reformatory was closed in 1922, when Acting Premier John George Bice declared that it was \\"entirely inadequate for its purpose.\\" The residents were moved to a Salvation Army home in the Adelaide suburb of Enfield. The reformatory had seen a number of problems prior to its closure, with the matron reprimanded in 1920 following complaints about its management, and an inmate riot in February 1921; by July 1921, it only held 13 inmates. It was used for the filming of the 1979 movie Breaker Morant. The building was restored in the late 1980s, with the National Trust of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia funding the renovations as an Australian Bicentenary project. It was subsequently opened as a museum containing various historical displays. It is open to the public as part of the Burra Heritage Passport tour, with the site operated by the National Trust. It was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 24 July 1980 and on the former Register of the National Estate on 21 March 1978.

As a superabsorbent material, it can absorb plenty water and turn water gel to store water. Hydrogel agriculture technology uses insoluble gel-forming polymers to improve the water-holding properties of different soils, such as clays and sandy loams. This can increase water-holding and water use (up to 85% for sand), improve soil permeability, reduce the need for irrigation, reduce compaction, soil erosion, and leaching, and improve plant growth. Desertification and lack of water threaten agriculture in many arid and semi-arid regions of the world; these may be mitigated with hydrogels.  Hydrogels  Hydrogels are hydrophilic crosslinked polymers that form three- dimensional molecular networks which can absorb and hold great amounts of water.  Different type of hydrogels in agriculture  Different types may be suitable for agricultural use. * A starch-based (grafing) hydrogel is biodegradable and cheap, and can be modified to adjust its ability to hold water. Cross-linked acrylic acid polymer hydrogels are commercially available; they are effectively insoluble but slowly break down releasing toxic acrylamide. * Mineral grafing type potassium polyacrylate. * None grafing type potassium polyacrylate. * Mineral grafing type sodium polyacrylate.  Potential uses in agriculture  Hydrogels of different kinds could be useful in agriculture, reducing drought stress in plants, making better use of irrigation water and fertilizer. Superabsorbent hydrogel polymers can in principle influence soil permeability, density, structure, texture, evaporation and infiltration rates of water through soils. They can also allow pesticides to be released slowly over a long period, increasing effectiveness and reducing side-effects such as pesticide runoff. There has therefore been considerable research interest into the possible use of hydrogels in agriculture. For example, a hydrogel based on gum tragacanth increases the water content of clay soil by up to 5.35% and of sandy loam by up to 5.5%; it could also be used to release calcium chloride slowly over a prolonged period. Suitably prepared hydrogels can simultaneously supply and slowly release pesticides (such as herbicides) in the soil, and increase a sandy soil's retention of water. Hydrogels developed for this purpose include polymers of oligooxyethylene methacrylate, linked by ionic and covalent bonds to a herbicide such as 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (CMPA). Other hydrophilic polymers studied have been made from a variety of different acrylate monomers to release the pesticides 2,4-D and CMPA. These offer different combinations of pesticide release rate and soil water retention. Hydrogels can also be used to encapsulate the insecticide cypermethrin and the fungicide copper sulphate. Superabsorbent polymers can be used to release phosphate fertiliser slowly, by making an ester bond between polyvinyl alcohol and phosphoric acid. A polymer/clay superabsorbent composite material made by attaching acrylamide to finely powdered attapulgite (a fuller's earth clay) shows promise for its excellent water retention and low cost compared to polyacrylamide hydrogel. Commercialization In 2015, The Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) reported the development of a novel hydrogel for agricultural use. It was intended to help farmers to cope with drought, making efficient use of water in arid and semi-arid regions of India. the product is to be commercialized by the Ministry of Science and Technology's National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) in collaboration with a company based in Chennai, Reliance Industries Limited. In 2016, a water absorbing material named Alsta hydrogel was introduced in the India agriculture market after testing from NTC Pune with a potential to absorb water 400 times of its own weight. It is a potassium polyacrylate based granular non-toxic polymer and soil conditioner that is compatible with all kind of soils and crops to greatly reduce irrigation frequency and loss of soil moisture by leaching and evaporation.

He broke an ashtray in a London taxi, which led to his being chased by police in a different taxi, and spending a night in jail. In the film, Harrelson, Wilson and Nelson play themselves in a story based on the real event, where Harrelson struggles to get home, while running into friends and members of a royal family. Harrelson announced the film in September 2016. According to Harrelson, the film contains 30 cast members and 14 shooting locations. The film also includes car and foot chase scenes. It is the first film that Harrelson has directed. The film was produced by Harrelson and Ken Kao of Waypoint Entertainment, while Fathom Events assisted in the live production. Nigel Willoughby is the cinematographer. The film was shot on 20 January, and it was broadcast in over 550 theatres in the United States starting 1800 PST on 19 January. The film was shot in a single take with one camera. The running time is approximately 100 minutes. After the live showing, Harrelson participated in a question and answer session. In addition to Harrelson, Wilson and Nelson, Zrinka Cvite≈°iƒá were also cast. The film officially premiered in London on 27 January 2017. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 8 reviews, and an average rating of 6.3/10. Writing for the London Evening Standard, Nick Curtis judged Harrelson's film, \\"A daft idea, the kind of mad, experimental challenge dreamed up by stoned film nerds after a Hitchcock all-nighter, but one he pulled off with considerable wit and brio. Lost In London is not a great film. How could it be when character and plot are slaves to the concept, when all we have is the frame of a single camera? But it is a brilliant technical and logistical achievement, especially from a first-time director previously known for comedy and character roles, and a hippyish devotion to marijuana. Laced with self- mockery, it's very funny, and far better than we had any right to expect.\\" In The Daily Telegraph, Tim Robey found, \\"It went alright on the night, with no hideous glitches\\", adding that, \\"Breaking new ground with this live experiment was only a matter of time, and single-take gambits of its ilk have been dabbled in for years. Had the technology allowed him back in 2000, Mike Figgis would surely have shown his brilliant, split-screen Timecode this way. Harrelson acknowledges his debt to the mesmeric German thriller Victoria, with its similar sense of urban emergency.\\" Robey praised Harrelson and Owen Wilson's trading of insults, before concluding, \\"[‚Ä¶] the film lurches to a halt more with relief that it's crossed the finish line than with anything you'd call an elegant climax. Who knows what it'll look like down the line as a record of its own premiere‚Äîthe live-streaming may well have been its oxygen. But we did watch the boundaries crumble outright between live performance and real, on-the-hoof film-making, to amply entertaining effect.\\" Ryan Gilbey, reviewing the film for The Guardian, noted that, \\"Actors who try their hand as a director typically start off with something small-scale‚Äîa sensitive coming- of-age story, say, such as Jodie Foster's Little Man Tate or Robert De Niro's A Bronx Tale. With Lost in London, Harrelson went as far in the opposite direction as one can imagine. This was edge-of-the-seat, seat-of-the-pants film-making. He didn't just jump in at the deep end: he did so into shark- filled waters.\\" Overall, Gilbey wrote, \\"Bumps and wrinkles in the film would doubtless have been remedied with the luxury of reshoots. [‚Ä¶] Nothing, though, will quite match the sensation of having watched the messy but miraculous birth of a genuine oddity: part celebrity satire, part mea culpa, part site- specific, one-night-only art installation.\\" Lost in London was favourably reviewed by Jason Solomons on BBC Radio 4's Front Row on 20 January 2017, having previewed it the evening before.

It is a sprawling shrub with its branches and leaves densely covered with white, woolly hairs and with deep pink or dark red, curved, tube-shaped flowers with spreading petal lobes on the end. It is similar to Hemiphora exserta except for its cottony leaf- covering and its longer stamens. Description Hemiphora lanata is a sprawling shrub which grows to a height of with its branches covered with woolly hairs but which become glabrous with age. The leaves are linear to narrow lance-shaped, long, wide, with their edges strongly curved downwards and both surface densely covered with woolly hairs. The similar H. exserta has leaves that are rough and warty on the upper surface and have short soft hairs on the lower surface of young leaves. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to three on woolly stalks long, in upper leaf axils. There are bracts long at the base of the flowers and which are glabrous on the inner surface and densely woolly outside, and shorter, glabrous bracteoles. The five sepals are long, and joined at their base to form a short tube at their bases. The sepals are scaly on the outside, linear to lance-shaped and remain attached to the plant after the petals have fallen. The petals are deep pink to dark red, long and joined to form a downward-curving tube, long and wide at the top end. The petal tube has soft hairs on the outside but glabrous inside except for a densely hairy ring around the ovary. The five petal lobes form two \\"lips\\", the upper lip with two short lobes and the lower with three. The lower central lobe is almost twice as large as the other four, elliptic to almost circular in shape, long and wide while the others are more or less egg- shaped. The four stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube with the lower pair longer than the upper pair. (H. exserta has stamens that are about the same length as the petal tube.) Flowering occurs from June to November and the fruit is almost spherical, hairy and in diameter. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1979 by Ahmad Abid Munir who gave it the name Pityrodia exserta var. lanata. The description was published in Adelaide Botanic Garden. In 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber raised the variety to species status and transferred four species, including this one, from the genus Pityrodia into Hemiphora. The specific epithet (lanata) is a Latin word meaning \\"woolly\\". Distribution and habitat Hemiphora lanata mainly occurs between Ravensthorpe, Hyden and Norseman in the Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows in sandy or salty clay on plains. It generally grows in more inland areas than H. exserta, although the two species sometimes grow near each other Conservation Hemiphora lanata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

He was the long-term research director at the Military History Research Office (MGFA) who conceived of and launched the seminal series Germany and the Second World War from the MGFA. Messerschmidt is one of the most important military historians of Germany after 1945 and is considered to be the founder of modern military history in Germany. He is an expert on the international military law and an author of multiple books on German military history of the 19th and 20th centuries. Education and career Born in 1926 in Dortmund, Messerschmidt grew up in Nazi Germany. From May 1944 till the end of World War II he served in anti- aircraft auxiliary forces in the engineering corps. Following the war, Messerschmidt studied the University of M√ºnster and the University of Freiburg. He completed his doctorate under the guidance of historian Gerhard Ritter and earned his PfD in 1959. From 1970 to 1988 he was chief historian at the Military History Research Office (MGFA). In 1987 to 1988 he was a member of the Waldheim Commission that investigated the Waldheim Affair, involving the alleged Nazi past of Kurt Waldheim, the newly elected President of Austria. Messerschmidt was the deputy chairman of the . Military historian of Nazi Germany At the end of 1971, Messerschmidt took over the scientific management of the MGFA. He launched the ten-volume history Germany and the Second World War, which focused on the interdependent relationship between military events and society. The first four volumes were set against the backdrop of the Cold War, and the German debate on rearmament in view of the catastrophic military past. The studies, which were designed and conceived in the Messerschmid era, continue to set the trend for a society-oriented military history. Messerschmidt is a recognised expert on the international military law who has been called upon to testify in high-profile court cases pertaining to World War II war crimes. He has been described as \\"the doyen of modern German military history\\" by Der Spiegel.

Low blood potassium may occur due to vomiting, diarrhea, or certain medications. The concentrated version should be diluted before use. It is given by slow injection into a vein or by mouth. Side effects may include heart problems if given too quickly by injection into a vein. By mouth it can result in abdominal pain, peptic ulcer disease, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Greater care is recommended in those with kidney problems. As long as high blood potassium does not occur, use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is believed to be safe for the baby. Generally, the strength of the formulation for injection into a vein should not be greater than 40 mmol/l (3 mg/l). Potassium chloride came into large scale commercial use as a fertilizer in 1861 and has been used medically since the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Potassium chloride is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 37th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 19 million prescriptions. Medical use Potassium chloride is used in the treatment of hypokalemia as an electrolyte replenisher. With a molecular weight of approximately 75 and a valence of 1, the use of KCl for electrolytes makes 75 mg the equivalent of 1 mEq. Some cardiac surgery procedures cannot be carried out on the beating heart. For these procedures, the surgical team will bypass the heart with a heart-lung machine and inject potassium chloride into the heart muscle to stop the heartbeat. Side effects Side effects can include gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding of the digestive tract. Overdoses cause hyperkalemia, which can lead to paresthesia, cardiac conduction blocks, fibrillation, arrhythmias, and sclerosis. Because of the danger of hyperkalemia, the US FDA limits the amount of potassium supplements to 99 mg (about 1.3 mEq) while recommending an adult daily intake of 4700 mg (about 63 mEq). History Slow-K is a 1950s development where the medicine is formulated to enter the bloodstream at delayed intervals. It was first only prescribed to British military forces to balance their diets while serving in Korea. Society Brand names Brand names include K-Dur, Klor-Con, Micro-K, Slow-K, Sando-K and Kaon Cl, most of which are extended release medicine by mouth. Lethal injection Potassium chloride is used in lethal injection as the third of a three-drug combination. KCl is also sometimes used in fetal intracardiac injections in second- and third-trimester induced abortions.Types of Abortion Procedures . Americanpregnancy.org (2011-09-20). Retrieved on 2012-02-16. Jack Kevorkian's thanatron machine injected a lethal dose of potassium chloride into the patient, which caused the heart to stop functioning, after a sodium thiopental-induced coma was achieved. Cardiac arrest induced by potassium has been used in political assassinations in Iran, by injection or by inserting a potassium suppository into the victim's rectum.

Life and career Born in Melbourne, Victoria in May 1940, Broinowski was the grandson of Robert Broinowski, a public servant and author about whom the younger wrote a biography: A Witness to History (published 2001). Obtaining his Bachelor of Laws from the University of Adelaide in 1961, Broinowski was admitted to the South Australian Supreme Court Bar in Adelaide in 1963. Later in 1963, Broinowski joined the Department of External Affairs as a junior diplomat and began studying Japanese at the Australian National University. His early postings were to Tokyo, Rangoon, Tehran and Manila. In 1975, when sent to Manila, he and his wife Alison Broinowski, whom he had married in 1963, became the first husband and wife the Department had sent to serve in the same mission. Broinowski was appointed to his first ambassadorial role in 1983, as Australian Ambassador to Vietnam. His appointment in Hanoi was for two years, during a time when the Australian Government wished to restore normal bilateral relations with Vietnam in the post-Vietnam War environment. The appointment was his first term serving separately to his wife, Alison, who was the Australian Government's cultural attache in Tokyo. At the time, Broinowski told media that he had reservations about the Department of Foreign Affairs' rule that a head of mission could not serve in the same legation as his or her spouse.

He was active in Richmond, Virginia and the surrounding region during the first half of the 20th century. In addition to his work on hotels, Wright was a pioneer of the Moorish Revival architectural style in his design for the Altria Theater (formerly known as the Mosque), which is a major component of the Monroe Park Historic District. Personal life Marcellus E. Wright was born on April 8, 1881, in Hanover County, Virginia, the son of Anthony Westley Wright and Isabella Wright (n√©e Granger). His father was a Confederate veteran who saw military service during the American Civil War at the Battle of Gaines's Mill. In 1906, Marcellus Wright married Ritta Brink Stovall at a ceremony which took place in Henrico County, Virginia. The marriage resulted in two children: Marcellus Eugene Wright Jr. and Frances Stovall Wright. Marcellus Wright Sr. was active in local politics as a member of the Democratic Party, and with his wife was involved in the Church of Christ, Scientist. He died on December 7, 1962, of what were reported to be natural causes, and is buried in Hollywood Cemetery. Multiple members of the Wright family went on to make a name for themselves in architecture. In 1936, Marcellus E. Wright Jr. joined his father's architectural firm; he later became a leading light of Virginia architecture leading the firm of Marcellus Wright Cox & Smith. Oscar Pendleton Wright, brother to the senior Wright, entered into partnership with noted Richmond firm Carneal & Johnston, where he worked on local projects such as St. Joseph's Villa. During his life, Marcellus Wright Sr. served as an active member of the Sons of the American Revolution, and from 1939-1940 was President of its Richmond Chapter. He was also a Freemason, having attained the thirty-second degree in the Scottish Rite. Career At the age of sixteen, Wright began work for Richmond architecture firm Noland & Baskervill, where he stayed for five years before moving to the Philadelphia firm Cope & Stewardson. He received his education from the Virginia Mechanics Institute, the Philadelphia School of Applied Art, and the University of Pennsylvania, the last of which he graduated from in 1905. After graduating, Wright swiftly rose to prominence in the Richmond architecture scene; he was one of the eleven founding members of the Richmond Association of Architects, which was established in 1911. By 1922, he had attained sufficient stature to have been elected a member of the American Institute of Architects. In April 1925, a collaboration between Marcellus Wright, Paul Philippe Cret, and Berthold Nebel produced the winning entry for a contest to design the Virginia War Memorial. Construction proceeded to the point of laying foundations before the project was scrapped. A carillon designed by Ralph Adams Cram was erected in its stead. Through the 1930s, Wright served on the Architectural Advisory Committee which presided over the Colonial Williamsburg restoration. Local architect Beth Nickels was hired to join Wright's firm in 1947 as a draftsman and project manager. Nickels was recognized by the Times-Dispatch as the first female architect from Richmond and one of the first from Virginia. Selected works The Altria Theater. The Hotel John Marshall. Marcellus Wright's works include: *The Altria Theater (1925), dedicated originally for use by the Shriners and operated as the Acca Temple Shrine; due to its multiple minarets and domes the building was known for years as \\"the Mosque.\\" It was designed in partnership with fellow Virginia architect Charles M. Robinson. In consideration for listing by the National Register of Historic Places, the Mosque was described as \\"an architectural fantasy on Moorish themes...a perfect example of turn-of-the-century American eclecticism.\\" *The William Byrd Hotel (1925), the first hotel designed by Marcellus E. Wright. Located across from Broad Street Station, the William Byrd Hotel was described by the Richmond News Leader as \\"a monument to Richmond energy, talent, and progressiveness.\\" In 1996, the former hotel was reopened as an apartment building. *The Wright Pavilion (1927), a component of the Blue Ridge Sanatorium which was sponsored by the Grand Lodge of Virginia and named in honor of Masonic leader George C. Wright. With capacity for sixty beds, the Pavilion was built to aid treatment of tuberculosis as part of the state-run tuberculosis sanatorium. In exchange for funding, members of the Grand Lodge obtained preference in admittance to the state-run facility, and any major changes had to seek Grand Lodge approval. This project marked Wright's second major collaboration with Charles M. Robinson, as Robinson was responsible for the Sanatorium's initial planning. *The Chamberlin (1928), formerly known as the Chamberlin Hotel and originally as the Chamberlin- Vanderbilt Hotel due to financial backing from the Vanderbilt family. Designed in the Beaux-Arts style and opened as a luxury resort on the Chesapeake Bay, the building is now in use as a retirement home catering to U.S. veterans. *The Hotel John Marshall (1929), an upscale fixture of downtown Richmond. Its main U-shaped structure originally was topped by a terracotta cornice, and rests upon a three-story limestone base. Since 2011, the former hotel has completed renovations and now functions as luxury apartments. Gubernatorial election festivities were held at the Hotel John Marshall by Virginia Governors-Elect Linwood Holton and Douglas Wilder. On other occasions, the hotel played host to multiple Presidents of the United States, including Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan. *The Parcel Post Building (1933), constructed under the aegis of the Public Works Administration. Wright collaborated with the Richmond firm of Lee, Smith & Vandervoort in order to design the building, drawing up plans that were heavily revised due to the ongoing Great Depression. A private bill for the relief of the architects was debated in the 74th United States Congress. The Parcel Post Building is currently maintained as part of the Lewis F. Powell Jr. United States Courthouse. *Lunenburg's Old County Courthouse (1939), originally built in 1827, modified and expanded by Marcellus Wright. The external stairs of the building are the most visible extant portion of Wright's expansion. *The Terminal Building of Richmond International Airport (1950), which at the time was still named after Virginia aviator Richard E. Byrd. At this point, Wright's son was managing day-to-day operations of the family firm; he later remarked that the design was one of his least favorite due to compromises that he was required to make.

The company was established in 1945 based on installations left by occupying German forces. From the mid to late 20th century it became one of the largest employers in the city and employed some 900 workers at its height. Aarhus Flydedok both produced and repaired ships although in its later years production focused on smaller vessels. The company entered bankruptcy proceedings in 1999 and finally closed in 2003.  History  Aarhus Flydedok was founded in 1945 but the early history extends back to the earlier 20th century. In 1913, Hans Nielsen, a lathe operator who had worked at the Frichs ironworks, started the small machine shop Hans Nielsens Maskinfabrik to service cranes, elevators and other transport infrastructure. The company over time transitioned to servicing ships and by the start of the Second World War in 1939 and the Occupation of Denmark in 1930 the machine shop handled almost all ship repairs in Aarhus harbor while also doing subcontracting work for Helsing√∏r Skibsv√¶rft (Elsinore Ship Yard). Shortly after the war ended in 1945 Hans Nielsen and Helsing√∏r Skibsv√¶rft created a new shipyard in Aarhus named I/S Aarhus Flydedok og Maskinkompagni. In 1941 Germany had built a floating dock in Kors√∏r, used as a submarine dock, which was moved to Aarhus harbor on 16 August 1945. The dock had been sabotaged by the Danish resistance movement but after a few months of repairs it was back in service and along with the new dock a hall for shipbuilding and a repair facility was constructed on the harbor front. The first task of the new shipyard was to repair German minesweepers which were cleaning the Danish territorial waters of mines. In 1948 the company was turned into a public limited company under the name Aarhus Flydedok og Maskinkompagni A/S with Helsing√∏r Skibsv√¶rft as the main stockholder. The ownership of the facilities were not finalized until 1952 when the United Kingdom officially transferred the dock to the Danish state after which Orlogsv√¶rftet temporarily leased it to Aarhus Flydedok before ownership was fully transferred on 1 January 1958. Up to 1967 the company was healthy and in the early 1960s it employed some 900 people; during this time the harbor facilities were expanded when a workshop was constructed in Risskov. In 1968 the shipyard suffered from fewer orders and were forced to cut the employees to about 450. In 1970 the board considered closing the company down but instead the company Rederiselskabet Dannebrog bought the shipyard from Helsing√∏r Skibsv√¶rft. In 1972 the company changed name to √Örhus Flydedok A/S although some orders were still completed under the old name. In 1976 the shipyard changed name again to Dannebrog V√¶rft A/S, √Örhus. From 1972 to 1984 the company was profitable again and there were enough orders to keep the department of shipbuilding running. The Danish shipyards suffered a general decline starting in the 1979s and employment dropped from 20,000 in 1976 to 14,000 in 1980. In the 1980s the crisis also reached √Örhus Flydedok and the number of employees fell to 180 in 1989. The company was close to bankruptcy when it was bought by the Ringk√∏bing based company Nords√∏v√¶rftets Holding A/S and the investment funds L√∏nmodtagernes Dyrtidsfond and Kommunernes Pensionsforsikring. The company was renamed Aarhus Flydedok A/S again. The shipbuilding department transitioned to smaller products in larger volumes while the repair department continued unchanged. The changes worked for a while but another crisis in the 1990s resulted in a bankruptcy in 1999. The shipyard employed 800 workers at the time. The last orders were filled after the company closed in 2003.

An outbreak of 11 tornadoes also struck Texas, injuring two.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/Texas/2017/January/table Meteorological history In mid-January, an unusual surge of atmospheric moisture surged into northwestern Mexico associated with an upper-level low near California. This moisture began to move into the High Plains and Central United States by the jet stream ahead of the low late on January 13, and, with below-freezing temperatures at the surface in much of Oklahoma, northern Texas, and Kansas, freezing rain began to explode into existence. The frozen precipitation continued to blossom as the day progressed. The low began to inject the aforementioned moisture into the state of Texas and Oklahoma as it slowly moved east-northeastwards across the Baja California peninsula and across the northern Gulf of California throughout the day on January 14. Meanwhile, icy conditions continued in much of the Central United States. By late on January 14, a surface low developed east of the upper-low as it moved swiftly towards the United States‚ÄìMexico border. The surface low, while intensifying, as a result of interaction with the incoming moisture, developed a squall line of thunderstorms along its cold front, as it and the upper-low emerged into the Southwestern United States. The entire storm system continued to push northeastwards through the state of Texas on January 15. In advance of the squall line that was moving rapidly to the east, scattered supercell thunderstorms popped up, and at one point during the nighttime hours, a tornado warning had to be issued for the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex, a rare occurrence.

He died as a prisoner in the Soviet Union. Life Kita Seiichi became an infantry officer in 1907 and was military attach√© to England in 1927. He served in several staff positions in China, until March 9 1940 when he became commander of the IJA 14th Division, based in Northern China. In the late 1930s he was placed in command of the Japanese special intelligence services operating in north China, which had the role of managing contact with local Chinese collaborators. As part of this, he tried to recruit such figures as former warlords Cao Kun and Wu Peifu to head the collaborationist regime the Japanese established in the region. It was on Major General Kita's suggestions that the puppet Provisional Government of the Republic of China was eventually established in December 1937. Thus he became known as the foremost Japanese \\"puppeteer\\" in north China. On October 15 1941 he was appointed Commander of the 6th Army based in Hailar until March 1 1943, when he took over the command of the 12th Army. In February 1944, he was recalled to Japan and was attached to the General Staff. On September 26 1944 he became Commander of the First Area Army, with which he fought unsuccessfully against the Red Army, when the Soviet Union invaded Manchukuo at the end of the war. Together with his surviving soldiers, he became prisoner of war in Siberia. He was never repatriated and is thought to have died in a prison camp in 1947 or 1952.

Edward James (1907‚Äì1984) was also a rich patron of the arts, a friend of painters such as Salvador Dal√≠, Ren√© Magritte and Leonor Fini, but also of musicians such as the conductor Igor Markevitch. He offered Francis Poulenc twice the sum that Winnaretta Singer had paid for Poulenc's Organ Concerto.Benjamin Ivry, Francis Poulenc, Phaidon Press, 1996, (p. 201). Francis Poulenc composed this cantata on four texts by Edward James between September and December 1937.S√©cheresses. FP 90 on the site of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. Two of the texts used had been published in the journal of surrealist inspiration Minotaure.Carl B. Schmidt, The Music of Francis Poulenc (1899‚Äì1963): A Catalogue, Clarendon Press, 1995, (p. 23). The composer dedicated his work to Yvonne de Casa Fuerte, a violinist who had married the Marquis of Casa Fuerte. The work was premiered at salle Pleyel in Paris on 2 April 1938 by the Concerts Colonne orchestra and the singers of Lyon under the direction of Paul Paray. This first performance was a failure with the audience, and the composer wanted to destroy the score of his work, but Georges Auric dissuaded him.Renaud Machart, Poulenc, Paris, √©ditions du Seuil, (p. 111).Roland Duclos, \\"Le singulier pluriel de S√©cheresses de Poulenc\\", Forum Op√©ra, 4 March 2015. S√©cheresses was played again much later, on 28 September 1953, by the Paris Radio Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Eug√®ne Bigot, and on 4 November 1953 at Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es by the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des concerts du Conservatoire under the direction of Georges Tzipine. The work was then a great success.Carl B. Schmidt, Entrancing Muse: A Documented Biography of Francis Poulenc, Pendragon Press, 2001, (p. 388).

The building is located at Bauman Street, 70. It was opened in 1868. After October Revolution the building was nationalized and then rebuilt. Currently it houses Skin and Venereal Diseases Dispensary. Synagogue's building has the status of an object of cultural heritage of regional significance.  History  The first wooden synagogue in Rostov-on-Don was built in 1855. It was located between the present-day Bauman and Ulyanovsk streets near Voroshilov Avenue. In 1863, a brick house of worship was built. But the building was fragile, and in 1866 the house was demolished. In 1868, a new two-story synagogue was built in its place. The authorship of the synagogue project is attributed to architect Sovitsky, collegiate assessor and senior city architect. A.G. Kaplun, S.I. Frey-schist, A.A Danziger also participated in construction works. Funds collection was organized by rabbi F.I. Gnesin, who was the father of Mikhail Gnessin, a famous composer. At the end a sum of 16 342 rubles was collected. Main Choral Synagogue was inaugurated on August 30, 1868. The ceremony was attended by Mayor A.M. Baikov. He noted in his speech that he aims \\"to equate Jews in terms of social position with the rest of the citizens of the city.\\" In 1881 there was built and attached to synagogue a house of worship, which could hold up to 150 people. Jewish Library and Reading Room was opened in the synagogue in 1903. Morevover, it also housed Talmud- Torah School. Thus, the Main Choral Synagogue became a religious and educational complex. The last rabbi of the synagogue before the 1917 Revolution was Z.M. Goldenberg. In 1924, the synagogue was municipalized, but the building continued to be run by the Jewish community. In Summer of 1935 the synagogue was nationalized, and there was establsiged a Dermatological and Venereal Hospital. The building was substantially rebuiltand its architectural appearance was distorted. The interiors have undergone redevelopment, the prayer hall was demolished. The appearance of the synagogue facades was also seriously distorted: the old windows were enlarged, much of the stucco decorations were destroyed. On Decree of the Head of Administration of the Rostov region ‚Ññ 411 of October 9, 1998 the Main Synagogue's building was placed under state protection as an object of cultural heritage of regional significance. In 2016 the government of the Rostov region decided to return the building of the synagogue to the Jewish community of Rostov.–†–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä –∫—É–∫–æ–ª –ø–µ—Ä–µ–µ–¥–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∞—Ä–º–µ–π—Å–∫—É—é, –∞ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–µ –∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞–¥—É—Ç –µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ö–∏–∏  See also  * Soldier Synagogue in Rostov-on-Don  References  Cultural heritage monuments in Russia Buildings and structures in Rostov-on-Don Synagogues completed in 1868 Orthodox synagogues in Russia ","title":"Main Choral Synagogue (Rostov-on-Don)"},{"id":"52869938","text":"Peter David Aitchison is a former New Zealand rower and manufacturer of farming equipment.

The aircraft was a 19-seater Let L-410 Turbolet carrying 19 passengers and 2 crew. Witnesses stated that the aircraft caught fire during take-off and exploded when it hit the ground. All on board were killed. The crash is currently the second deadliest aircraft crash in Haiti and the second worst accident involving a Let L-410 Turbolet, after Sakha Avia Flight 301. The Haitian investigative board stated that multiple factors caused the crash, one of which was an opened cargo door during mid-flight. The pilots were struggling to return to the airport. Subsequent poor CRM contributed to the crash. Flight The flight was a daily domestic flight operated by Tropical Airways, the national airline of Haiti at the time. The airline was authorized to operate by the Ministry of Commerce of the Republic of Haiti on 1 June 1998. The National Civil Aviation Office issued the license of operation on 12 February 1999 The flight was operated by a Let L-410UVP-E3 registered as HH- PRV and was carrying 19 passengers and 2 crews. All except the crew were Haitians; the Captain was an American and the co-pilot was Spanish. It was flying from Cap-Ha√Øtien, the capital of the Department of Nord on the north coast of Haiti to Port-de-Paix, the capital of the Nord-Ouest department. Flight 1301 took off from Runway 05 of Hugo Ch√°vez International Airport at around 04:50 p.m local time. During take off, ATC workers at the control tower spotted that the cargo door opened. While the controller was preparing to tell Flight 1301 about the problem, the crew asked permission to return to the airport to land. Permission was granted and the flight was asked to make a right rear wind landing. The aircraft turned to the left, crashed, skidded and exploded, followed by a rising thick black smoke. Local residents and rescuers rushed to the scene and find the charred and scattered wreckage on a sugarcane field about 2 km from the airport. All 21 people on board were killed. Most of them were charred beyond recognition. Investigation The flight was neither equipped with a CVR nor a FDR and therefore the investigation relied on the wreckage of the aircraft and the air traffic controller recording. A number of components were extracted from the wreckage for analysis. The propellers were examined by a delegation sent by the manufacturer Avia Hamilton and the Czech Civil Aviation. Investigators revealed that these propellers were still rotating with a high number of turns at impact and none of them were in the flag position after impact. The position of the flaps (tlaps) was also analyzed. Investigative commission stated that the flaps were in \\"Full down\\" 42 ¬∞ position. The controller stated that after the crew reported the problem on the cargo door and conducted a turn to the airport, the pilot seems to have the aircraft under control. The controller stated that the plane could have made it to the airport. However, the altitude of the aircraft was much lower than a normal approach altitude. The Let L-410 manufacturer's test pilot's report mentions the following: \\"In a flight configuration (right turn at low altitude) where the Weight was either excessive or at the maximum limit, the flaps were extended to maximum (42¬∞ full down); This situation could significantly reduce the speed of the aircraft. During the turn, the rudder could be in an uncoordinated position and engines generate an asymmetric thrust. \\" The combination of these factors could critically increase the drag caused the plane to enter a stall condition. In the examination of the carcass of the engines, there is no evidence that a fire broke out before impact. Investigative team could not determine the total weight of Flight 1301 since there was no documents about the weight of the aircraft and the cargo. The Captain's record indicated that he was qualified and had passed the flight proficiency test in accordance with the applicable rules. It indicated that during the three months prior to the accident, he worked normally according to a 7/7 schedule, that is to say 7 days of work followed by 7 days of rest. However, the Committee noted that during the month of August, the month in which the accident occurred, that schedule had been interrupted. From August 9 to 24, the Captain was overworked and was possibly sleep deprived due to this. Haitian investigators then stated that the Captain could have been fatigued during the crash. Conclusion Haitian investigators then published the cause of the accident as stall during approach phase while on the downwind leg caused by the loss of VMC at low altitude The contributing factors were: * failure of the crew to manage the approach procedure (Poor CRM) * use of maximum flaps (42¬∞) * insufficient altitude * lack of coordination between crew members * possible state of fatigue of the captain * Possible excess weight * opening of the baggage hold door, observed during takeoff.

The entries in this timeline fall into the following categories: architecture, astronomy, cartography, metallurgy, logic, mathematics, metrology, mineralogy, automobile engineering, information technology, communications, space and polar technology. This timeline examines scientific and medical discoveries, products and technologies introduced by various peoples of India. Inventions are regarded as technological firsts developed in India, and as such does not include foreign technologies which India acquired through contact.  7000 BC  * Ancient Dentistry: The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 BC. An IVC site in Mehrgarh indicates that this form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead crafters.  5000 BC  * Ayurveda: Ayurveda is a system of medicine with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent. The origins of Ayurveda have been traced back to around 5,000 BC, when they originated as an oral tradition.  3100 BC  * Yoga: The origins of yoga are a matter of debate. There is no consensus on its chronology or specific origin other than that yoga developed in ancient India. Suggested origins are the Indus Valley Civilization (3300‚Äì1900 BC) and pre-Vedic Eastern states of India, the Vedic period (1500‚Äì500 BC), and the ≈õrama·πáa movement.  2500 BC  * Ancient flush toilet systems: Toilets that used water were used in the Indus Valley Civilization. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system. See also Sanitation of the Indus Valley Civilisation. * Diamond mining: Diamonds are thought to have been first recognized and mined in India, where significant alluvial deposits of the stone could be found many centuries ago along the rivers Penner, Krishna and Godavari. Diamonds have been known in India for at least 3,000 years but most likely 6,000 years. * Stepwell: Earliest clear evidence of the origins of the stepwell is found in the Indus Valley Civilization's archaeological site at Mohenjodaro in Pakistan. The three features of stepwells in the subcontinent are evident from one particular site, abandoned by 2500 BC, which combines a bathing pool, steps leading down to water, and figures of some religious importance into one structure. The early centuries immediately before the common era saw the Buddhists and the Jains of India adapt the stepwells into their architecture. Both the wells and the form of ritual bathing reached other parts of the world with Buddhism. Rock-cut step wells in the subcontinent date from 200 to 400 AD. Subsequently, the wells at Dhank (550-625 AD) and stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850-950 AD) were constructed.  2400 BC  * Ruler: Rulers made from Ivory were in use by the Indus Valley Civilization in what today is Pakistan and some parts of Western India prior to 1500 BC. Excavations at Lothal (2400 BC) have yielded one such ruler calibrated to about 1/16 of an inch‚Äîless than 2 millimeters. Ian Whitelaw (2007) holds that 'The Mohenjo-Daro ruler is divided into units corresponding to 1.32 inches (33.5 mm) and these are marked out in decimal subdivisions with amazing accuracy‚Äîto within 0.005 of an inch. They correspond closely with the \\"hasta\\" increments of 1 3/8 inches traditionally used in South India in ancient architecture. Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units.' Shigeo Iwata (2008) further writes 'The minimum division of graduation found in the segment of an ivory-made linear measure excavated in Lothal was 1.79 mm (that corresponds to 1/940 of a fathom), while that of the fragment of a shell-made one from Mohenjo-daro was 6.72 mm (1/250 of a fathom), and that of bronze-made one from Harapa was 9.33 mm (1/180 of a fathom).' The weights and measures of the Indus civilization also reached Persia and Central Asia, where they were further modified. * Weighing scale: The earliest evidence for the existence of weighing scale dates to 2400 BC-1800 BC in the Indus valley civilization prior to which no banking was performed due to lack of scales.  2000 BC  * Plastic surgery: Plastic surgery was being carried out in India by 2000 BC. The system of punishment by deforming a miscreant's body may have led to an increase in demand for this practice. The surgeon Sushruta contributed mainly to the field of plastic and cataract surgery. The medical works of both Sushruta and Charak were translated into Arabic language during the Abbasid Caliphate (750 AD). These translated Arabic works made their way into Europe via intermediaries. In Italy, the Branca family of Sicily and Gaspare Tagliacozzi of Bologna became familiar with the techniques of Sushruta.  700 BC  * Pythagorean theorem: Mesopotamian, Indian and Chinese mathematicians all discovered the theorem independently and, in some cases, provided proofs for special cases. In India, the Baudhayana Sulba Sutra, the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th and 5th century BC, contains a list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, and a geometrical proof of the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles right triangle. The Apastamba Sulba Sutra (c. 600 BC) contains a numerical proof of the general Pythagorean theorem, using an area computation. Van der Waerden believed that \\"it was certainly based on earlier traditions\\". Carl Boyer states that the Pythagorean theorem in ≈öulba-s≈©tram may have been influenced by ancient Mesopotamian math, but there is no conclusive evidence in favor or opposition of this possibility.  500 BC  * Formal grammar: Panini in his treatise Astadyayi gives formal production rules and definitions to describe the formal grammar of Sanskrit. In formal language theory, a grammar (when the context is not given, often called a formal grammar for clarity) is a set of production rules for strings in a formal language. The rules describe how to form strings from the language's alphabet that are valid according to the language's syntax. A grammar does not describe the meaning of the stringsor what can be done with them in whatever context‚Äîonly their form.  300 BC  * Atomism: References to the concept of atomism and its atoms are found in ancient India and ancient Greece. In the West, atomism emerged in the 5th century BC with Leucippus and Democritus. In India, the Jain, Ajivika and Carvaka schools of atomism date back to the 4th century BC. The Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools later developed theories on how atoms combined into more complex objects. Whether Indian culture influenced Greek or vice versa or whether both evolved independently is a matter of dispute.  200 BC  * Crucible steel: Perhaps as early as 300 BC‚Äîalthough certainly by 200 BC‚Äîhigh quality steel was being produced in southern India, by what Europeans would later call the crucible technique. In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in a crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon.  100  * Hindu number system: With decimal place- value and a symbol for zero, this system was the ancestor of the widely used Arabic numeral system. It was developed in the Indian subcontinent between the 1st and 6th centuries AD.  200  * Cataract surgery: Cataract surgery was known to the Indian physician Sushruta (3rd century AD). In India, cataract surgery was performed with a special tool called the Jabamukhi Salaka, a curved needle used to loosen the lens and push the cataract out of the field of vision. The eye would later be soaked with warm butter and then bandaged. Though this method was successful, Susruta cautioned that cataract surgery should only be performed when absolutely necessary.Greek philosophers and scientists traveled to India where these surgeries were performed by physicians. The removal of cataract by surgery was also introduced into China from India.  500  * Zero, symbol: Indians were the first to use the zero as a symbol and in arithmetic operations, although Babylonians used zero to signify the 'absent'. In those earlier times a blank space was used to denote zero, later when it created confusion a dot was used to denote zero (could be found in Bakhshali manuscript). In 500 AD circa Aryabhata again gave a new symbol for zero (0).  600  * Brahmagupta‚ÄìFibonacci identity, Brahmagupta formula, Brahmagupta matrix, and Brahmagupta theorem: Discovered by the Indian mathematician, Brahmagupta (598‚Äì668 AD). * Algebraic abbreviations: The mathematician Brahmagupta had begun using abbreviations for unknowns by the 7th century. He employed abbreviations for multiple unknowns occurring in one complex problem. Brahmagupta also used abbreviations for square roots and cube roots. * Chaturanga: The precursor of chess originated in India during the Gupta dynasty (c. 280-550 AD). Both the Persians and Arabs ascribe the origins of the game of Chess to the Indians. The words for \\"chess\\" in Old Persian and Arabic are chatrang and shatranj respectively ‚Äî terms derived from catura·πÖga in Sanskrit, which literally means an army of four divisions or four corps. Chess spread throughout the world and many variants of the game soon began taking shape. This game was introduced to the Near East from India and became a part of the princely or courtly education of Persian nobility. Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders and others carried it to the Far East where it was transformed and assimilated into a game often played on the intersection of the lines of the board rather than within the squares.Chaturanga reached Europe through Persia, the Byzantine empire and the expanding Arabian empire. Muslims carried Shatranj to North Africa, Sicily, and Spain by the 10th century where it took its final modern form of chess. * Ludo: Pachisi originated in India by the 6th century. The earliest evidence of this game in India is the depiction of boards on the caves of Ajanta. This game was played by the Mughal emperors of India; a notable example being that of Akbar, who played living Pachisi using girls from his harem. A variant of this game, called Luodo, made its way to England during the British Raj. * Spinning wheel: Invented in India, between 500 and 1000 A.D. * Finite Difference Interpolation: The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta presented what is possibly the first instance of finite difference interpolation around 665 AD. * Pascal's triangle: Described in the 6th century CE by Varahamihira and in the 10th century by Halayudha, commenting on an obscure reference by Pingala(the author of an earlier work on prosody) to the \\"Meru-prastaara\\", or the \\"Staircase of Mount Meru\\", in relation to binomial coefficients. (It was also independently discovered in the 10th or 11th century in Persia and China.)  700  * Fibonacci numbers: This sequence was first described by Virahanka (c. 700 AD), GopƒÅla (c. 1135), and Hemachandra (c. 1150), as an outgrowth of the earlier writings on Sanskrit prosody by Pingala (c. 200 BC). * Earth's orbit (Sidereal year): The Hindu cosmological time cycles explained in the Surya Siddhanta(700 BC-600 AD), give the average length of the sidereal year (the length of the Earth's revolution around the Sun) as 365.2563627 days, which is only a negligible 1.4 seconds longer than the modern value of 365.256363004 days. This remains the most accurate estimate for the length of the sidereal year anywhere in the world for over a thousand years.  1000  * Chakravala method: The Chakravala method, a cyclic algorithm to solve indeterminate quadratic equations is commonly attributed to BhƒÅskara II, (c. 1114 ‚Äì 1185 AD) although some attribute it to Jayadeva (c. 950~1000 AD). Jayadeva pointed out that Brahmagupta‚Äôs approach to solving equations of this type would yield infinitely large number of solutions, to which he then described a general method of solving such equations. Jayadeva's method was later refined by BhƒÅskara II in his Bijaganita treatise to be known as the Chakravala method, chakra (derived from cakra·πÉ ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ç) meaning 'wheel' in Sanskrit, relevant to the cyclic nature of the algorithm. With reference to the Chakravala method, E. O. Selenuis held that no European performances at the time of BhƒÅskara, nor much later, came up to its marvellous height of mathematical complexity.  1300  * Madhava series: The infinite series for œÄ and for the trigonometric sine, cosine, and arctangent is now attributed to Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1340 ‚Äì 1425) and his Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. He made use of the series expansion of to obtain an infinite series expression for œÄ. Their rational approximation of the error for the finite sum of their series are of particular interest. They manipulated the error term to derive a faster converging series for œÄ.They used the improved series to derive a rational expression, for œÄ correct up to eleven decimal places, i.e. . Madhava of Sangamagrama and his successors at the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics used geometric methods to derive large sum approximations for sine, cosine, and arctangent. They found a number of special cases of series later derived by Brook Taylor series. They also found the second-order Taylor approximations for these functions, and the third-order Taylor approximation for sine.  1500  * Seamless celestial globe: Considered one of the most remarkable feats in metallurgy, it was invented in Kashmir by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in between 1589 and 1590 AD, and twenty other such globes were later produced in Lahore and Kashmir during the Mughal Empire. Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern metallurgists to be technically impossible to produce metal globes without any seams, even with modern technology. These Mughal metallurgists pioneered the method of lost-wax casting in order to produce these globes.  1600  * Prefabricated home and movable structure: The first prefabricated homes and movable structures were invented in 16th-century Mughal India by Akbar. These structures were reported by Arif Qandahari in 1579.  1700  * Shampoo: The word shampoo in English is derived from Hindustani chƒÅmpo (‡§ö‡§æ‡§Å‡§™‡•ã, ), and dates to 1762. A variety of herbs and their extracts were used as shampoos since ancient times in India. A very effective early shampoo was made by boiling Sapindus with dried Indian gooseberry (aamla) and a few other herbs, using the strained extract. Sapindus, also known as soapberries or soapnuts, is called Ksuna (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Å‡§£) in ancient Indian texts and its fruit pulp contain saponins,a natural surfactant.The extract of Ksuna, creates a lather which Indian texts identify as phenaka (Sanskrit: ‡§´‡•á‡§®‡§ï). which leaves the hair soft, shiny and manageable.Other products used for hair cleansing were shikakai (Acacia concinna), soapnuts (Sapindus), hibiscus flowers, ritha (Sapindus mukorossi) and arappu (Albizzia amara). Guru Nanak, the founding prophet and the first Guru of Sikhism, made references to soapberry tree and soap in 16th century. Cleansing with hair and body massage (champu) during daily strip wash was an indulgence of early colonial traders in India. When they returned to Europe, they introduced the newly learnt habits, including hair treatment they called shampoo. * Mysorean rockets: The first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rockets were developed by Tipu Sultan, ruler of the South Indian Kingdom of Mysore, and his father Hyder Ali, in the 1780s. He successfully used these iron-cased rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo- Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, and were soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.  1800  * Microwave Communication: The first public demonstration of microwave transmission was made by Jagadish Chandra Bose, in Calcutta, in 1895, two years before a similar demonstration by Marconi in England, and just a year after Oliver Lodge's commemorative lecture on Radio communication, following Hertz's death. * Iron and mercury coherer: In 1899, the Bengali physicist Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose announced the development of an \\"iron-mercury-iron coherer with telephone detector\\" in a paper presented at the Royal Society, London. He also later received U.S. Patent 755,840, \\"Detector for electrical disturbances\\" (1904), for a specific electromagnetic receiver.  1900  * Boson: The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose. In quantum mechanics, a boson () is a particle that follows Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics. Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. * Raman effect: The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008) reports: \\"change in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by molecules. The phenomenon is named for Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, who discovered it in 1928. When a beam of light traverses a dust-free, transparent sample of a chemical compound, a small fraction of the light emerges in directions other than that of the incident (incoming) beam. Most of this scattered light is of unchanged wavelength. A small part, however, has wavelengths different from that of the incident light; its presence is a result of the Raman effect.\\" * Landau‚ÄìRamanujan constant, Mock theta functions, Ramanujan conjecture, Ramanujan prime, Ramanujan‚ÄìSoldner constant, Ramanujan theta function, Ramanujan's sum, Rogers‚ÄìRamanujan identities, Ramanujan's master theorem: Discovered by the Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan. * Chandrasekhar limit and Chandrasekhar number: Discovered by and named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983 for his work on stellar structure and stellar evolution. * Crescograph: The crescograph, a device for measuring growth in plants, was invented in the early 20th century by the Bengali scientist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose. * Pseudomonas putida: Indian (Bengali) inventor and microbiologist Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty created a species of man made micro organism to break down crude oil. He genetically engineered a new species of Pseudomonas bacteria (\\"the oil-eating bacteria\\") in 1971. United States Supreme Court granted Chakrabarty's invention patent even though it was a living species. The court ruling decreed that Chakrabarty's discovery was \\"not nature's handiwork, but his own...\\" The inventor Chakrabarty secured his patent in 1980(see Diamond v. Chakrabarty) * Yellapragada Subbarow discovered the function of adenosine triphosphate as an energy source in the cell, and developed methotrexate for the treatment of cancer. * Har Gobind Khorana was the first to demonstrate the role of nucleotides in protein synthesis. He shared the 1968 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Marshall W. Nirenberg and Robert W. Holley for research that showed how the order of nucleotides in nucleic acids, which carry the genetic code of the cell, control the cell‚Äôs synthesis of proteins. * Abhyankar's conjecture, Abhyankar's lemma, Abhyankar‚ÄìMoh theorem: Developed by Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar. * Saha ionization equation: The Saha equation, derived by the Bengali scientist Meghnad Saha (6 October 1893 ‚Äì 16 February 1956) in 1920, conceptualizes ionizations in context of stellar atmospheres. * Basu's theorem: The Basu's theorem, a result of Debabrata Basu (1955) states that any complete sufficient statistic is independent of any ancillary statistic. * Visceral leishmaniasis, treatment of: The Indian (Bengali) medical practitioner Upendranath Brahmachari (19 December 1873 ‚Äì 6 February 1946) was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for his discovery of 'ureastibamine (antimonial compound for treatment of kala azar) and a new disease, post-kalaazar dermal leishmanoid.' Brahmachari's cure for Visceral leishmaniasis was the urea salt of para-amino-phenyl stibnic acid which he called Urea Stibamine. Following the discovery of Urea Stibamine, Visceral leishmaniasis was largely eradicated from the world, except for some underdeveloped regions. * Raychaudhuri equation: Discovered by the Bengali physicist Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri in 1954. This was a key ingredient of the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems of general relativity. * Ajay V. Bhatt, an Indian-American computer architect, helped define and develop several widely used technologies, including USB (Universal Serial Bus), AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port), PCI Express, Platform Power management architecture and various chipset improvements.  2000  * J Sharp: Visual J# (pronounced \\"jay-sharp\\") programming language was a transitional language for programmers of Java and Visual J++ languages, so they could use their existing knowledge and applications on .NET Framework.It was developed by the Hyderabad-based Microsoft India Development Center at HITEC City in India. * Kojo (programming language): Kojo is a programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) for computer programming and learning.Kojo is open-source software. It was created, and is actively developed, by Lalit Pant, a computer programmer and teacher living in Dehradun, India. * Lunar water: Although the presence of water ice on the moon has been conjectured by various scientists since the 1960s,inconclusive evidence of free water ice had also been identified the first incontrovertible evidence of water on the moon was provided by the payload Chace carried by the Moon Impact Probe released by Chandrayaan-1 confirmed and established by NASA.
