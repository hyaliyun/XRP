Biscailuz (March 12, 1883 - May 16, 1969)Finding Aid of the Eugene Biscailuz scrapbooks 0216 was an American police officer. He organized the California Highway Patrol, and later became the 27th Sheriff of Los Angeles County, California, serving in that capacity for 26 years, from 1932 to 1958. Family and early life Biscailuz was born in Boyle Heights on March 12, 1883. Sheriff Biscailuz's father, Martin V. Biscailuz, was an attorney of French-Basque descent. His mother, Ida Rose Warren, was a descendant of Spanish pioneer Jose Maria Claudio Lopez, a soldier at the San Gabriel Mission. Her father William Warren was an early Los Angeles city marshal killed in a gun battle in 1870. Biscailuz attended St. Vincent's College (now called Loyola Marymount University), later earning a law degree from the University of Southern California. In 1902, Biscailuz met and married Willette Harrison, whose father was a captain at San Quentin State Prison and later the sheriff of Marin County. The couple had two children, and stayed married until Willette's death in 1950. Career After working briefly as a shipping clerk in Los Angeles and San Francisco, Biscailuz was appointed as a foreclosure clerk by Sheriff William A. Hammel in 1907. His law background helped him rise in the ranks until he was appointed undersheriff in 1921. Biscailuz first came to public attention in 1923, when he was asked to accompany the District Attorney to Honduras to bring back convicted murderer Clara Phillips, who had escaped from the County Jail after her conviction. His wife accompanied him on the trip, and contracted a tropical infection from which she never fully recovered. Later, Biscailuz was involved in the 1927 manhunt for child kidnapper and murderer William Edward Hickman, and led raids that eventually helped bring an end to the gambling empire of Tony Cornero. In 1929, Governor C.C. Young asked Biscailuz to reorganize the old State Motor Patrol. He was appointed the first Superintendent of the new California Highway Patrol (CHP), where Biscailuz organized the Highway Patrol system, then a new but separate law enforcement agency. Having finished his work for the CHP, in 1931 he resumed his post as undersheriff of Los Angeles County. In 1932, after Sheriff William Traeger stepped down to run for Congress, the Board of Supervisors appointed Biscailuz Sheriff in 1932 with Traeger's endorsement and supported by thousands of signed petitions. He later ran unopposed for six terms. As sheriff, he pioneered a practice of putting well-behaved prisoners to work on \\"honor farms\\" in hopes of rehabilitating them. After the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, Biscailuz was called upon to send fire fighting personnel and equipment, but needed more information about where to send them and what was needed. There were also rumors that the city had been struck by a tidal wave, and that Catalina Island had sunk 369 feet. Phone lines in the region had been knocked out, and the roads were nearly impassable because of debris and fallen power lines. Biscailuz asked a friend, C. N. (Jimmy) James, a pilot of Western Air Express, to fly an open cockpit plane over Long Beach to gather more information. James was able to determine that the rumors about Catalina and the tidal wave were not true, and that there were only two small fires burning in Long Beach. The entire flight took approximately 30 minutes. Biscailuz revamped the Sheriff Department's aero squadron to include private pilots flying their own planes to assist in aerial searches and rescues. This unit later evolved into the Sky Knight project of 1966, and is now the LASD Aero Bureau. Upon his retirement in 1958, the Board of Supervisors named him \\"sheriff emeritus for the rest of his life.\\" Planning commission He was a member of the city's first planning commission in 1920, which at that time was composed of 51 members appointed by the City Council \\"to work out an organized, comprehensive plan of city development.\\" Other notable members were Charles A.

The second version retained the same shortened book size, but changed to a gray cover vice red, with same cover images. And the endpapers changed to a pictorial, shown below. The 3rd version changed to a thinner paper, so the entire book became thinner. The book height was slightly larger, and the book covers were changed completely.

The word tote is probably African in origin and came into English via Gullah. Totes are often used as reusable shopping bags. The archetypal tote bag is made of sturdy cloth, perhaps with thick leather at its virgin handles or bottomless tops; leather versions often have a pebbled surface. Common fabrics include heavy canvas, possibly dyed, or treated to resist moisture and mold. Jute is another traditional material, though less popular. In recent decades, heavy nylon and other easy-care synthetics have become common, although these may degrade with prolonged sun-exposure. Many of today's inexpensive or free totes are often made from recycled matter, from minimally-processed natural fibers, or from byproducts of processes that refine organic materials. Environmental concerns A promotional tote bag Recently, tote bags have been sold as a more eco-friendly replacement for disposable plastic bags, given they can be reused multiples times. They have also been given away as promotional items. A study by the UK Environment Agency found that cotton canvas bags have to be reused at least 131 times before they can match the carbon expenditure of a single disposable plastic bag, and up to 327 times if the plastic bags are used as bin liners. Another 2018 study by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency found that cotton bags would need to be used 7,100 times to neutralize their environmental impact. Meanwhile, tote bags made from recycled polypropylene plastic require 11 (up to 26 when considering reuse as bin liners for plastic bags) reuses to match. A 2014 study of U.S. consumers found that the 28% of respondents who own reusable bags forgot them on approximately 40% of their grocery trips and used the bags only about 15 times each before discarding them. About half of this group typically chose to use plastic bags over reusable ones, despite owning reusable bags and recognizing their benefits. An increasing number of jurisdictions have mandated the phase-out of lightweight plastic bags to reduce land and ocean pollution. In order to provide an incentive for consumers to remember reusable bags more often these laws establish a minimum price for bags at checkout and require either paper, reusable fabric tote bags, or thick reusable plastic bags.

It is composed of three villages: Bazna, Boian (Bonnesdorf; Bonnesdref; Als√≥bajom) and Vel»õ (W√∂lz; Welz; Velc or V√∂lc). It lies 13 km northeast of Media≈ü, within the catchment area of the T√¢rnava MicƒÉ River. Settled by Transylvanian Saxons in the 13th century, in the late 1870s the Bazna area became part of Austria-Hungary's Kis-K√ºk√ºll≈ë County, in the Dics≈ëszentm√°rton subdivision. Following the Union of Transylvania with Romania in 1918, its villages became part of the Kingdom of Romania. At the 2011 census, 66.7% of inhabitants were ethnic Romanians, 29.7% Roma, 2.6% Hungarians and 0.8% Germans. At the 2002 census, 86.6% were Romanian Orthodox, 4% Greek-Catholic, 3.6% Pentecostal, 2.2% Reformed, 1.4% Baptist and 0.9% Lutheran. Villages Bazna Fortified church of Bazna Bazna village is first attested in a document of 1302. Initially, Saxons had settled to the west, near Boian, but due to the scenic aspect of Bazna valley, moved there and built an imposing fortified church. History , Bazna Town Hall; accessed September 11, 2010 The church is built in Gothic style and incorporates 13th- century Romanesque elements, with the enclosure walls dating from the 15th and 16th centuries. When natural gas and spring water containing salt and iodine were discovered in the 18th century, they drew notice from Transylvanian scientists. Among these were the Sibiu pharmacist Georg Bette, who studied the springs after 1752. The priest Andreas Caspari left a manuscript containing his observations for the 1762-1779 period. In it, he describes a number of healing springs, with names he gave them such as \\"Church spring\\", \\"Beggars' spring\\" and \\"Bitter fountain\\". In 1808, the Austrian Empire's officials in Vienna sent a committee of doctors and chemists to Bazna in order to study the healing properties of its salt waters and climate. In 1843, four inhabitants of Media≈ü founded a society aimed at building a spa in Bazna; by 1845, 637 people were being treated there. In 1905, Bazna's Lutheran parishioners took control of the spa and its operations. That year, the spa had a pharmacy and specialist doctor, and began producing salt for distribution. Boian Boian village is located 4 km from Bazna, along the Boian valley and surrounded by tall hills. First attested in 1309 in a document called \\"Teodorch de villa Boneti\\" as the seat of the T√¢rnava MicƒÉ archbishop. In 1359, it was part of Kukoliensis (T√¢rnava) comitatus in the Kingdom of Hungary, and in 1372, it is mentioned as \\"Boyan\\" and \\"villa Boyum\\". In 1395, it was part of Cetatea de BaltƒÉ district and remained there for a long time, including when the latter belonged to the voivodes of Moldavia. Around 1488, during the reign of Stephen III, King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary donated a number of villages, including Boian, as fiefs to Moldavia, a situation that lasted until the reign of Alexandru LƒÉpu≈üneanu, when the princes of Transylvania decided to reclaim the villages. Today, the coat of arms of Moldavia appears in the church and on the gate tower. Vel»õ The fortified church in Vel»õ The name of Vel»õ village is probably derived from the Hungarian v√∂lgy, meaning \\"valley\\". It was first mentioned in 1359 under the names of Velz and Veolcz (V√∂lc). In 1372 it was mentioned as Weulcz; in 1861, under the Germanized name Wolzen. One of the smallest villages in the Media»ô area, it was first recognized as a small village in 1876; in 1909 it was deemed a large village. Located along the Vel»õ valley, it is surrounded by wooded hills with a maximum height of 442 m. In 1850 the population of the village was 992, including 568 Romanians, 368 Germans, and 54 Roma; there were 396 Greek Catholics, 368 Lutherans, and 226 Eastern Orthodox. In 1900, there were 1112 inhabitants: 651 Romanians, 421 Germans, and 40 Hungarians; there were 500 Greek Catholics, 423 Lutherans, and 156 Eastern Orthodox. By 2002, the population had fallen to 627, including 344 Romanians, 269 Roma, and 14 Hungarians; there were 470 Eastern Orthodox, 102 Greek Catholics, and 47 Pentecostals.

They differ, however, in their use of a quick drying liquid paste as their medium. By using a paste instead of an alcohol base, the marking is semi- permanent, and will not be wiped away by a whiteboard eraser. Additionally, the paste is less likely to cause allergic reaction than dry-erase alcohol or chalk dust. Because of their semi-permanent nature, wet wipe markers are often used to draw a template, especially in school classrooms or on calendars (to mark the boxes). Dry erase markers can usually be applied on top of the wet wipe marker, and erased without touching the wet wipe marks. Wet wipe markers were often used on overhead projector transparencies, as they could be stored and transported easily, unlike a traditional chalkboard. With the rise of computerized slide-shows (e.g. PowerPoint) in the classroom and office, overhead usage has reduced substantially, and with it, the wet wipe marker.

A director's chair is a lightweight chair that folds side-to-side with a scissors action. The seat and back are made of canvas or a similar strong fabric which bears the user's full weight and can be folded; the frame is made of wood, or sometimes metal or plastic. The seat and scissors members work together to support and distribute the sitter's weight so that the seat is comfortably taut. The back is usually low and the chair usually has armrests. The stereotypical image of a movie director on location includes one of these chairs, hence the name. Victor Papanek describes this chair as an excellent design in his book Design for the Real World as it is simple and ideally suited to its function. The design goes back to coffer-makers' chairs of the 15th century and eventually to the Roman curule chair. The modern American style director's chairs were introduced by the Gold Medal Camp Furniture company. In 1892, the Gold Medal Classic design won an award for excellence in casual furniture design in the lead-up to the 1893 World's Fair Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

He represented his country in both rugby league and rugby union. The eldest of the four Burge brothers, Peter was one of the first Australian dual-code rugby internationals. Rugby union career Playing rugby union with South Sydney in 1904 the twenty-year-old Burge was selected for the Metropolis (City) representative side against the Great Britain tourists. When the All Blacks toured in 1905 Burge played against them firstly for Metropolis and then in a New South Wales side. Burge, a lock claimed a total of three international rugby caps for Australia. In two of these matches, he served as captain. His debut game was against New Zealand, at Sydney, on 20 July 1907. He made two rugby union tours, to New Zealand in 1905 with the first full Australian team and later on the epic 1908‚Äì09 Australia rugby union tour of the British Isles and France under captain Paddy Moran. On both trips he only played one game due to injury. On the Wallaby tour of 1908 he broke his tibia in his first match against Devon. He took no further part in the tour and one of the replacements sent over to fill the touring squad was his brother Albert Burge. Rugby league career He was one of the fourteen 1908‚Äì09 Wallabies including Chris McKivat, Charles McMurtie, \\"Boxer\\" Russell and Arthur McCabe who defected to rugby league after their return from the Olympics and the epic tour. In Burge's case he joined his brother Alby in the 1909 \\"Wallabies v Kangaroos\\" promotional match which then disqualified him from the amateur code. He joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1910 but then the following year linked with Alby and Frank at Glebe. He toured Great Britain on the 1911‚Äì12 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, captained by his former Wallaby and then Glebe captain, Chris McKivat. He made four tour matches appearances for Australia. Along with McMurtie and Bob Stuart, Peter Burge made his international league debut in a tour match on that 1911 tour but did not play in any Tests. Collectively they were therefore Australia's 17th to 19th dual-code rugby internationals. Coaching career Like Frank Burge had done in 1927, Peter in 1937 coached the St. George Dragons. Death Peter Burge died suddenly at his brother Frank's house in Hurstville, New South Wales on 15 July 1956, age 72.

Background Among Agnes Blackwell Herrick's papers was a copy of the Paris Embassy's Dinner Party Record from 1921 to 1922. There were 16 different bombes in the collection of recipes, many with geographic names like Alhambra, Muscovite and Cleopatre. It was part of the menu for the wedding of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, served with \\"Filet de Sole Mountbatten\\" and partridge. It was served at a White House state dinner hosted by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and President Kennedy for the Sudanese president Ibrahim Abboud, and by Queen Elizabeth for Laura and President Bush.  Preparation  The bombe mold is lined with ice cream and filled with a mixture that is called \\"P√¢t√© √† bombe\\" so the ice cream forms the outer shell of the dessert. The filling can be flavored with a fruit-based coulis like raspberry.  Types Baked Alaska is a bombe which is baked, frozen and flamb√©ed.The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets A recipe for \\"chocolate & meringue bombe\\" is given in Mary Berry's Complete Cook Book. The Italian dessert spumoni is shaped as a bombe with a semifreddo or parfait filling and custard ice cream forming the outside layer. The \\"watermelon bombe\\" is three layered with green- tinted ice cream on the outside, with a thin layer of white ice cream and a red inside layer with chocolate chips. Nesselrode Pudding is a thick custard cream with sweet puree of chestnut, raisins, candied fruit, currants, cherry liquor and whipped cream molded and served chilled as a bombe with maraschino custard sauce.

It was serialized in the magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from August 11, 2008 to April 23, 2012, with the 176 chapters collected into 20 tank≈çbon volumes by Shueisha. The story follows talented artist Moritaka Mashiro and aspiring writer Akito Takagi, two ninth grade boys who wish to become manga artists, with Mashiro as the artist and Takagi as the writer. Some characters resemble real authors and editors of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, and many manga titles mentioned in Bakuman have actually been published in the magazine. An anime television adaptation of the series created by J.C.Staff began airing on NHK-E on October 2, 2010. The third and final season of which ended broadcast on March 30, 2013. A live-action film adaptation was released on October 3, 2015. Bakuman was the seventh best-selling manga series of 2011 and the tenth best of 2012, and had over 15 million volumes in circulation by May 2014. Additionally, it is the first manga released online by Shueisha in multiple languages before becoming available in print outside Japan. In 2009, Viz Media announced it had licensed the series for a North American release. Besides releasing the series in collected volumes, they also released it in their online manga anthology Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha. Plot When Moritaka Mashiro, a junior high student, forgets his notebook in class, he finds his classmate, Akito Takagi, who notes Mashiro's drawings. Takagi asks him to become a manga artist to his stories. However, Mashiro declines, citing his late manga artist uncle, who died from overworking. Takagi incites Mashiro to meet with Miho Azuki, Mashiro's crush, and tells her the two plan to become manga artists. In response, Azuki reveals her plans to be a voice actress. Mashiro proposes to her that they should both marry when Azuki becomes a voice actress for the anime adaptation of their manga. She accepts, but under the condition that they not meet face-to-face again until then. The two then start creating their manga, under the pen name Muto Ashirogi, in hopes of getting serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. After submitting many one-shots to Shueisha, Ashirogi begin with their first published series in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, , which is eventually canceled due to its declining popularity, after Mashiro is hospitalized for overworking on the manga. Their next series is the gag manga , which they give up on, realizing it will never be popular, coupled with Takagi's difficulty with writing rapid-fire humor. After being challenged by the editor-in-chief of Jump to create a superior manga to their rival's, Ashirogi develops their current series . It is met with considerable popularity but due to its theme, is unfit for an anime series. When their rival, Eiji Nizuma, submits a one-shot for serialization, Ashirogi competes by submitting Reversi which replaces Perfect Crime Party while the latter is moved to Shueisha's fictional monthly magazine, Hisshou Jump. After many conflicts involving the graphic novel sales and the voice actress choice, Reversi is chosen for an anime adaptation with Miho as the primary actress, after she passes a public audition. After fulfilling their dreams, the series ends with Mashiro officially proposing to Miho at the place they made their promise, the front gate of Miho's old home, followed by their first kiss. Production Tsugumi Ohba came up the idea for Bakuman after thinking of all the people who long to be manga artists. Because he is in the industry, he felt he could create a manga about manga. He said that for the fictional manga created in the series, he did not worry about the plot and settings, only focusing on \\"cranking them out.\\" He revealed that he did actually make storyboards for the fictional The Classroom of Truth, and one he created for Otter No. 11 is actually seen in Bakuman. When creating a chapter, Ohba does not meet with Takeshi Obata. He discusses things with his editor and creates storyboards that are given to Obata. Obata then creates his own storyboards that are given to Ohba and their editor. The author said only minor changes are made and they never have disagreements. Ohba referred to Bakuman as \\"a weird series.\\" He revealed that the hardest part was coming up with new ideas as the story kept getting longer. But said because of this, he was able to include stories that he never initially considered. When asked how accurate the manga process depicted in Bakuman is to reality, current Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump editor-in-chief Hiroyuki Nakano said that as a work of fiction, some things are exaggerated for dramatic effect, \\"But it takes a lot of details from real life, so I think it's quite close.\\" Media Manga Written by Tsugumi Ohba and drawn by Takeshi Obata, Bakuman was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine from its premiere on August 11, 2008 to its end on April 23, 2012. The 176 chapters were then collected into 20 tank≈çbon volumes from January 5, 2009 to July 4, 2012. Several chapters of the series were released on Jumpland's official website in Japanese, English, French, and German; the first chapter released on August 19, 2008. It is Shueisha's first manga to be released online in multiple languages before becoming available in print outside Japan. A 15-page one-shot of the series , the gag manga created by the character Kazuya Hiramaru in Bakuman, was published in the August 8, 2010 issue of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. It was then published the following week in Sh≈çnen Jump Next on August 16. Viz Media included an English translation of it in the free SJ Alpha Yearbook 2013, which was mailed out to annual subscribers of Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha in December 2012. In commemoration of the live- action film release, two new chapters were created by Ohba and Obata under the title . They are set before Takagi and Mashiro first met, with the first chapter published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump on September 21 and the second on September 28, 2015. In addition to the success of Bakuman in Japan, the series has also been licensed worldwide: in Korea by Daiwon C.I. and serialized in their Comic Champ manhwa magazine, by Tong Li Publishing in Taiwan, Kana in France, Norma in Spain, Tokyopop in Germany, Comics House in Malaysia, Kim Dong Publishing House in Vietnam, in Brazil by Editora JBC and NED in Thailand. At San Diego Comic-Con International 2009, Viz Media announced it had licensed the series for English release in the US and Canada. The first volume was released on August 3, 2010, and all 20 volumes have been published as of August 6, 2013. In addition to the collected volumes, Viz also published the series online in their manga anthology Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha (now known as simply Weekly Shonen Jump). Bakuman started with chapter 162 in the anthology's debut issue on January 30, 2012, and ended with the series' final chapter released on May 7, 2012. Viz digitally released the two Bakuman. Age 13 chapters in Weekly Shonen Jump on the same days that they ran in Japan. Anime A 25-episode anime television series based on Bakuman was announced in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump's second issue of 2010.

Live-action film A live-action film adaptation of Bakuman was released on October 3, 2015. Written and directed by Hitoshi Ohne (Moteki), the film stars Takeru Satoh as Moritaka Mashiro and Ryunosuke Kamiki as Akito Takagi. Japanese rock band Sakanaction performed the soundtrack, Motion Music of Bakuman, including the theme song \\"Shin Takarajima\\", which they released as a single four days before the film's release. Other media A video game based on Bakuman was made for the Nintendo DS by Namco Bandai Games. was released in Japan on December 15, 2011. A novel titled PCP -Perfect Crime Party- and based on the fictional manga of the same name created by Takagi and Mashiro in Bakuman was released by Shueisha on October 2, 2015. It was written by Sei Hatsuno, although Takagi and Mashiro's fictional pen name \\"Muto Ashirogi\\" is credited with the original story. Reception Bakuman was nominated for the third annual Manga Taish≈ç award in 2010. The first volume of the series placed fourth on the Oricon manga chart during its debut week, selling 154,675 copies. The second volume followed suit, placing second during its first week with 228,056 copies. The third volume continued the trend and placed fourth during its debut week, selling 200,369 copies. During the first half of 2009, the first volume placed twenty-eighth and the second volume placed twenty-seventh on Oricon's list of fifty top-selling manga in Japan, selling 381,633 and 394,567 copies respectively. Bakuman was the seventh best- selling manga series of 2011, with almost 4.4 million copies sold, and the tenth best of 2012, with over 3.2 million sold that year. As of April 2012, over 13 million copies had been sold, with this number growing to over 15 million copies in publication by May 2014. In the United States, volume one debuted at number 6 on The New York Times Manga Graphic Books list for the week of August 12 and remained on the list for eight weeks straight. Jason Thompson referred to Bakuman. as \\"a love letter to the manga industry done in old-school shonen manga style.\\" He felt that while it can be \\"text-heavy\\" on the process of making manga, it is ultimately a \\"heroic story of self- improvement, friendship and striving to succeed.\\" Thompson cited the villain characters as the most interesting, but called the series sexist for only portraying females as either \\"bitter, man-hating viragos motivated by grudges against men\\" or \\"patient helpmates\\" striving to support them instead. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network praised the conflicting viewpoints of the protagonists and was surprised that the series succeeds, not only as a manga about manga, but as a slice-of-life story about the dreams of youth. However, Santos remarked that the series could learn from Ohba and Obata's previous serial Death Note; commenting that the beginning is not as gripping and the plot twists are \\"pretty weak\\" and \\"seem like petty contrivances.\\" Despite this, he believes that the series is \\"another hit.\\" Christopher Butcher reviewing volume one for About.com had strong praise for the art, calling it \\"quite possibly the best-drawn manga out today.\\" He also enjoyed the behind- the-scenes information on the manga industry. Like Thompson, Butcher did state that while he enjoyed it, he has reservations about recommending Bakuman. because it is \\"horribly sexist.\\" The film was number-one at the Japanese box office on its opening weekend, with . It earned during the October 18 weekend. At the 39th Japan Academy Prize awards, its editor Yasuyuki ≈åzeki won the Japan Academy Prize for Best Film Editing award, while Sakanaction's Motion Music of Bakuman won the Outstanding Achievement in Music award. The film was also one of two releases that won the Popularity award, alongside Maku ga Agaru. Matt Schley of Otaku USA wrote that Bakuman. is \\"a real celebration of and testament to the unique power of Japan's comics culture\\" and the best live-action manga adaptation he's seen this year. Kotakus Toshi Nakamura also suggested that it is possibly the best live-action manga adaptation he's seen. However, he said the motivational romance between Mashiro and Azuki was \\"surprisingly inconsequential\\" and boring. Mark Schilling for The Japan Times gave the film four out of five stars, with strong praise for director and screenwriter Hitoshi ≈åne.

There is evidence of Paleolithic (Homo erectus) people in Sri Lanka from about 300,000 BP and possibly even as early as 500,000 BP. There is strong evidence of prehistoric settlements in Sri Lanka by about 125,000 BP. Evidence of a transition between the Mesolithic and the Iron Age is scant. Fluctuations in sea level led to Sri Lanka being linked to the Indian subcontinent from time to time over the past million years. The last such link occurred about 5000 BC.Deraniyagala (1996) Overview Periodization of Sri Lanka history: Stone Age The stone age had approximately existed from 125,000 years ago to 1800 BC minimum Palaeolithic Findings at Iranamadu indicate that there were Paleolithic people in Sri Lanka as early as 300,000 BP.Pichumani (2004) There is definite evidence of settlements by prehistoric people in Sri Lanka by about 125,000 BP. These people made tools of quartz and chert which are assignable to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Mesolithic The island appears to have been colonized by the Balangoda Man (named after the area where his remains were discovered) prior to 34,000 BP. They have been identified as a group of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers who lived in caves. Fa Hien Cave has yielded the earliest evidence (at c. 34,000 BP) of anatomically modern humans in South Asia. Several of these caves including the well known Batadombalena and the Fa Hien Cave have yielded many artefacts that points to them being the first modern inhabitants of the island. There is evidence from Belilena that salt had been brought in from the coast earlier than 27,000 BP. In June 2020 research carried out by the Max Planck Institute, Griffith University in Australia, and the Department of Archaeology (Government of Sri Lanka), showed that occupants of the Fa-Hien Lena cave had developed bow and arrow technology 48,000 BP. This is the oldest use of this technology outside of Africa. Several minute granite tools of about 4 centimeters in length, earthenware and remnants of charred timber, and clay burial pots that date back to the Stone Age Mesolithic people who lived 8,000 years ago have been discovered during recent excavations around a cave at Warana Raja Maha Vihara and also in Kalatuwawa area. The skeletal remains of dogs from Nilgala cave and from Bellanbandi Palassa, dating from the Mesolithic era, about 4500 BC, suggest that Balangoda People may have kept domestic dogs for driving game. The Sinhala Hound is similar in appearance to the Kadar Dog, the New Guinea Dog and the dingo. It has been suggested that these could all derive from a common domestic stock. It is also possible that they may have domesticated jungle fowl, pig, water buffalo and some form of Bos (possibly the ancestor of the Sri Lankan neat cattle which became extinct in the 1940s).Deraniyagala (1992), p. 454 The Balangoda Man appears to have been responsible for creating Horton Plains, in the central hills, by burning the trees in order to catch game. However, evidence from the plains suggests the incipient management of oats and barley by about 15,000 BC.Deraniyagala, nd Mesolithic‚ÄìIron Age transition The transition in Sri Lanka from the Mesolithic to the Iron Age has not been adequately documented. A human skeleton found at Godavaya in the Hambantota district, provisionally dated back to 5000‚Äì3000 BC, was accompanied by tools of animal-bone and stone. Walawe gang moayen ip√¶rani maanavayek, Lankadeepa, 21 August 2008. However, evidence from Horton Plains indicates the existence of agriculture by about 8000 BC, including herding of Bos and cultivation of oats and barley. Excavations in the cave of Dorawaka-kanda near Kegalle indicate the use about 4300 BC of pottery, together with stone stools, and possibly cereal cultivation. Slag found at Mantai dated to about 1800 BC could indicate the knowledge of copper-working. Cinnamon, which is native to Sri Lanka, was in use in Ancient Egypt in about 1500 BC, suggesting that there were trading links with the island. It is possible that Biblical Tarshish was located on the island (James Emerson Tennent identified it with Galle).Galle : \\"Tarshish\\" of the Old Testament Iron Age During the protohistoric period (1000-500 BCE) Sri Lanka was culturally united with southern India, and shared the same megalithic burials, pottery, iron technology, farming techniques and megalithic graffiti. This cultural complex spread from southern India along with Dravidian clans such as the Velir, prior to the migration of Prakrit speakers.Robin Conningham - Anuradhapura - The British-Sri Lankan Excavations at Anuradhapura Salgaha Watta Volumes 1 and 2 (1999/2006)Sudharshan Seneviratne (1989) - Pre-State Chieftains And Servants of the State: A Case Study of Parumaka -http://dlib.pdn.ac.lk/handle/123456789/2078 A large settlement appears to have been founded before 900 BC at the site of Anuradhapura, where signs of an Iron Age culture have been found. The size of the settlement was about 15 hectares at that date, but it expanded to 50 ha, to 'town' size within a couple of centuries. A similar site has been discovered at Aligala in Sigiriya.Deraniyagala, 2003 The earliest chronicles the Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa say that the island was inhabited by tribes of Yakkhas (demons), Nagas (cobras) and devas (gods).Mahawamsa, chapter 1 These may refer to totemist Iron Age autochthones. Pottery dating back to the early 4th century BCE has been found at Anuradhapura, bearing BrƒÅhmƒ´ script (among the earliest extant examples of the script) and non-Brahmi writing, which may have arisen through contact with Semitic trading scripts from West Asia. The emergence of new forms of pottery at the same time as the writing, together with other artifacts such as red glass beads, indicate a new cultural impulse, possibly an invasion from North India. The Brahmi writing appears to be in Indo-Aryan Prakrit and is almost identical to the Asokan script some 200 years later; none appears to be in Dravidian - corroborating the view that Indo- Aryan was pre-dominant from at least as early as 500 BC in Sri Lanka.

Plot A wild young woman, Nasa Springer (Clara Bow), born and raised in Texas by well-to-do parents, rebels against her father. She is sent to school in Chicago, where her disruptive behavior marks her as a troublemaker. She marries a rich playboy, who then declares the marriage a ploy and abandons her. She is renounced by her father, who tells her he never wishes to see her again. She discovers she is pregnant and bears a child. Reduced to poverty, she moves into a boardinghouse with her infant, and struggles to pay for the baby's basic needs. Unaware that her grandfather in Texas has died and left her a $100,000 fortune, a desperate Nasa dresses up as a prostitute and goes out in the neighborhood hoping to earn some quick cash to purchase medicine for her child. While she is out, a drunken lout at the boardinghouse drops a match and accidentally sets the building on fire. Nasa's infant is killed in the blaze.

Originally published in print as . Reprinted 2003 (Gretna, LA: Pelican Publishing Co.) His family company specializes in historical and decorative plasterwork and the Barth√© family has been plastering since 1850. The Barth√© family settled in New Orleans in the early 19th century and the family business was established by Barth√©'s great-great-grandfather, a master plasterer from Nice, France, who married a woman from Haiti. The family was known in the term of the time as \\"free people of color.\\" Over the years, the family has worked on many historic buildings. Most of the fine hotels and old stores along Canal Street as well as the mansions and the cemeteries' tombs on St. Charles Avenue include work by Barth√© and his family. Barth√©'s father worked on such historic buildings as the Saint Louis Cathedral, the French Market, and the Saenger Theater. Barth√© has also worked on several notable projects and is known for decorative plaster and stucco work that reflects an array of French, Spanish, Anglo-American neo-classical, and African American aesthetics, in sync with the historic architecture of New Orleans. For his work, Barth√© was inducted into the Louisiana AFL-CIO Labor Hall of Fame. Today, Barth√©'s daughter, Terry Barth√©, leads the family business. In 2001, Barth√© was documented as part of the New Orleans Building Arts Project which culminated in an exhibit of his work along with other New Orleans trade artists entitled, Raised to the Trade: Creole Building Arts in New Orleans.

Wesson to develop Walter Hunt's Rocket Ball ammunition and lever action mechanism. Volcanic made an improved version of the Rocket Ball ammunition, and a carbine and pistol version of the lever action gun to fire it. While the Volcanic Repeating Arms Company was short lived, its descendants, Winchester Repeating Arms Company and Smith & Wesson became major firearms manufactures. A Volcanic pocket pistol A Volcanic rifle, 16 1/2 inch barrel History The original 1848 Volition Repeating Rifle design by Hunt was revolutionary, introducing an early iteration of the lever action repeating mechanism and the tubular magazine still common today. However, Hunt's design was far from perfect, and only a couple of prototypes were developed; the only one known is currently in the Firearms Museum in Cody, Wyoming. Lewis Jennings patented an improved version of Hunt's design in 1849, and versions of the Jenning's patent design were built by Robbins & Lawrence Co. (under the direction of shop foreman Benjamin Tyler Henry) and sold by C. P. Dixon. Horace Smith was also hired by Courtlandt Palmer to improve the Jennings Rifle, patenting the Smith-Jennings in 1851. It is estimated that fewer than 2000 of these two models were made until 1852, when financial troubles ceased production. In 1854, partners Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson joined with Courtlandt Palmer, the businessman who had purchased the Jennings and Smith-Jennings patent rights, and further improved on the operating mechanism, developing the Smith & Wesson Lever pistol, and a new Volcanic cartridge. Production was in the shop of Horace Smith in Norwich, Connecticut. The new cartridge improved upon the Hunt Rocket Ball with the addition of a primer. Originally using the name \\"Smith & Wesson Company\\", the name was changed to \\"Volcanic Repeating Arms Company\\" in 1855, with the addition of new investors, one of which was Oliver Winchester. The Volcanic Repeating Arms Company obtained all rights for the Volcanic designs (both rifle and pistol versions were in production by this time) as well as the ammunition, from the Smith & Wesson Company. Wesson remained as plant manager for 8 months before rejoining Smith to found the \\"Smith & Wesson Revolver Company\\" upon obtaining the licensing of the Rollin White rear loading cylinder patent. A full size Volcanic pistol Winchester forced the insolvency of the Volcanic Arms Company in late 1856, took over ownership and moved the plant to New Haven, Connecticut, where it was reorganized as the New Haven Arms Company in April 1857. B. Tyler Henry was hired as plant superintendent when Robbins & Lawrence suffered financial difficulties and Henry left their employ. While continuing to make the Volcanic rifle and pistol, Henry began to experiment with the new rimfire ammunition, and modified the Volcanic lever action design to use it. The result was the Henry rifle. By 1866, the company once again reorganized, this time as the Winchester Repeating Arms company, and the name of Winchester became synonymous with lever action rifles. In popular culture The Rider, the title character of Edward M. Erdelac's Judeocentric Lovecraftian weird west series Merkabah Rider, carries a Volcanic pistol inlaid with gold and silver and bearing various Solomonic talismans and wards, including a jeweled Tree of Sephiroth on the handle. In the video games Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2 and the latter game online modes Red Dead Online, the protagonists can wield the Volcanic pistol. It is a weapon available to players in the Fistful of Frags video game as well. Volcanic pistol is also featured in the video game Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood.

Design and development By the mid-1970s, the Soviet Defense Ministry determined that the Mi-24 ‚ÄúHind‚Äù attack helicopter (then the backbone of the Soviet Army Aviation) was not going to meet future Army requirements. Acting on the advice of the Ministry, the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on the development of a new-generation combat helicopter that could be fielded with the Soviet Army Aviation in the 1980s. The prospective helicopter's primary purpose was to destroy the armored forces close to the forward edge of battle area (FEBA). This resolution pitted competing programs run by N.I. Kamov and Ml. Mil's design bureaus against each other. At that time, both developers had already gained valuable experience in designing and producing rotary-wing aircraft. Design of the V-80 (later Ka-50), began at the Kamov Helicopter Plant in January 1977. The program was run by the head of the design bureau, Chief Designer Sergei Mikheyev, who was later to become Designer General. Kamov designers believed that combining the duties of flying, navigation, target detection, and tracking could be automated to a degree that a single crew member could perform all functions. Further, it was not expected that this would cause an excessive psychological and physical strain on the pilot. By the late seventies, the sophistication level of the Soviet helicopter industry ensured the building of such automatic systems was possible; even the Ka-25 and Ka-27 featured an automatic submarine search capability, automatic navigation and flight modes, automatic data exchange among the helicopters operating in the same flight, etc. A single-person crew would provide the benefits of weight reduction, better flight performance, reduce training costs and reduce the number of possible combat casualties. One of the program priorities was to enhance the helicopter's survivability. With this goal in mind, the configuration and systems' arrangement were chosen, assemblies designed, and structural materials tested. The helicopter lacked a very vulnerable tail rotor as well as an intermediate and tail reduction gearbox and control rods. The following measures to enhance pilot survivability were taken: ‚Ä¢ The engines were placed on both sides of the airframe to prevent a single hit from destroying both engines ‚Ä¢ The helicopter could fly on a single engine in various modes ‚Ä¢ The cockpit was armored and screened with combined steel/aluminum armor and armored Plexiglas ‚Ä¢ The hydraulic steering system compartment was armored and screened ‚Ä¢ Vital units were screened by less important ones ‚Ä¢ Self-sealing fuel tanks were filled with polyurethane ‚Ä¢ Composites were used to preserve the helicopter's efficiency when its load- carrying elements are damaged ‚Ä¢ A two-contour rotor-blade spar was developed ‚Ä¢ Control rod diameter was increased by positioning most of them inside the armored cockpit ‚Ä¢ The powerplant and compartments adjacent to the fuel tanks were fire-protected ‚Ä¢ The transmission is capable of operating for 30 minutes if the oil system is damaged ‚Ä¢ The power supply systems, control circuits, etc. were made redundant and placed on opposite sides of the airframe ‚Ä¢ Individual protection is provided to the pilot The armor consisted of spaced- aluminum plates with a total weight of more than 300 kg. The armor is fitted into the fuselage load-bearing structure, which reduces the total weight of the helicopter. GosNIIAS tests confirmed the pilot's protection up to 20mm caliber cannon rounds and shell fragments. A unique feature of this helicopter is the use of a rocket-parachute ejection system in case of an emergency. The helicopter emergency-escape system uses the K-37-800 ejection seat that was developed by the Zvezda Scientific Production Association (Chief Designer Guy Severin). The pilot's safety was also ensured by the undercarriage design. The undercarriage is capable of absorbing large loads in an emergency landing, and the cockpit has a crunch zone of up to 10‚Äì15% upon impact. Additionally, the fuel system is designed to remove the possibility of fire after a rough landing. A model of an earlier design from around 1975 shows a two-seat aircraft with an airframe similar to that of the V-60, a pair of widely spaced downward facing vertical stabilisers, a fixed GSh-23L forward firing gun in the fuselage and two stub wings incorporating one hardpoint each and a pod containing the retractable undercarriage. Further studies include novel features such as a variable azimuth stub wing, a biplane stub wing/canard configuration, additional fuselage hardpoints, ejecting exhaust on either side of the tail to reduce the heat signature, making the forward firing gun depressible and single seat as well as two seat configurations. Specification weight was 4000 kg empty and 6500 kg takeoff. The first V-80 prototype (Bort 010) left the Kamov Helicopter Plant in June 1982. On 17 June, for the first time, test pilot Nikolay Bezdetnov performed a hover in the V-80 and on 23 July the V-80 made its maiden forward flight. The V-80Sh-1 prototype version was the configuration used for the Ka-50 production version. Production of the attack helicopter was ordered by the Soviet Council of Ministers on 14 December 1987. Following initial flight testing and system tests the Council ordered the first batch of the helicopter in 1990. The attack helicopter was first described publicly as the \\"Ka-50\\" in March 1992 at a symposium in the United Kingdom.Donald 2004, pp. 310‚Äì11.

Navasota was sold for scrapping in 1995. She was the only U.S. Navy ship to bear the name Navasota.  Construction and commissioning  Navasota was laid down under Maritime Commission contract on 22 February 1945 as Maritime Commission hull 2702 by Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania. She was launched on 30 August 1945, sponsored by Mrs. A. Hahn, and commissioned on 27 February 1946, Commander David H. McCluskey, USNR, in command.  Operational history, 1946‚Äì63  The USS Navasota (AO-106) refueling the aircraft carrier USS Lexington (CVA-16) and the destroyer USS Marshall (DD-676) in the eastern Philippine Sea during the 1958 Taiwan Strait Crisis. After three months of shakedown and training off the United States East Coast, Navasota steamed via the Panama Canal for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and the western Pacific Ocean. Assigned to Service Force, United States Pacific Fleet, she departed Pearl Harbor on 3 July 1946 to bring petroleum products from the Persian Gulf to the Pacific fleet. She stood out of Yokosuka, Japan, on 20 August 1946 for San Pedro, California, arriving on 2 September 1946. For the next four months, the oiler was in an operational training status, and on 30 January 1948, she again deployed to the Western Pacific. After serving as station ship at Tsingtao, China, from April through June 1948, she returned to San Pedro, California, on 7 July 1948, thence to Pearl Harbor in August 1948. Navasota departed Pearl Harbor on 13 October 1948, once again en route the Far East. She departed Yokosuka on 20 November 1948 for Tsingtao and remained on station until 30 December 1948, when she sailed for California via Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Long Beach, California, on 19 January 1949, steamed to Kodiak, Alaska on 1 February 1949, returned to San Francisco on 25 February 1949, and continued to operate on the west coast of the United States for the next year. Navasota again deployed to the Western Pacific on 1 May 1950. When the North Koreans crossed the 38th parallel north on 25 June 1950, beginning the Korean War, the oiler steamed for Korean waters to fuel Allied ships in the area. In late August 1950, she put in at Keelung, Formosa, but she was back in Korean waters to take part in the Inchon invasion on 15 September 1950. She steamed for Pearl Harbor on 22 October 1950, and then for Japan via Kwajalein and Guam. Departing Japan on 16 December 1950, she arrived at Long Beach on 30 December 1950, only to return to the Far East on 31 March 1951 for further operations off Wonsan, Korea. During her Korean operations Navasota fueled ships in Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, in Buckner Bay on Okinawa, in the Pescadores Islands, in Formosa, in Japan, and in Korea. She returned to Long Beach for overhaul from October 1951 until February 1952. The oiler operated off the U.S. West Coast until getting underway on 3 April 1952 for Sasebo, Japan, and resumption of her Korean fueling operations. She remained in the area of Wonsan and Songjin, Korea, for the next seven months and then returned to Long Beach, arriving there on 13 November 1952. Navasota steamed from Long Beach on 2 February 1953 for Pearl Harbor to participate in Mercantile Convoy Exercise RES 53B, after which she called at Sasebo on 26 February 1953 to commence her fourth Pacific deployment. For the next seven months, she conducted fueling operations in Korean waters. She was also used as station ship at Kaohsiung, Formosa, where she fueled units of the Formosa Straits Patrol until she headed for Long Beach on 3 September 1953. For the next ten years, Navasota continued to provide fueling services to the fleet through her annual Western Pacific deployments. In one overhaul at Long Beach Naval Shipyard from February to May 1958, all guns save her single 3-inch (76.2-mm) mounts were removed. Highlights in this period included service as a fuel ship during the nuclear weapons tests at Bikini Atoll in the summer of 1956 and her Western Pacific deployment of 1958, when she refueled 174 ships from August through November while serving as station ship at Makung in the Pescadores. \\"Jumboization\\", 1963‚Äì64 Upon completion of her 15th Western Pacific deployment on 14 October 1963, Navasota was scheduled for \\"jumboization\\", the first oiler so designated. She steamed on 14 November 1963 for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, for preliminary preparations, then entered Puget Sound Bridge and Drydock Company, Plant No. 2, Harbor Island, Seattle, Washington for the conversion. Her new 394-ft (120.1 m) midsection was built in Kawasaki Dock Yard, Kobe, Japan, and towed to Seattle by the Japanese tug Daisho Maru No. 1. The \\"jumboization\\" process consisted of five basic steps. First, the bow was removed and retained in the drydock while the rest of the ship was floated out. Next, the new section was floated in, raised, and joined to the bow. Third, the bridge structure was transferred to the new section by heavy lift crane on 9 January 1964. Then the stern section was severed and retained in drydock while the old midsection was floated out. In the last step, the new section with bow and bridge structure attached, was floated into the dock, raised, and joined to the stern. Although replacement of the midsection was the single largest change in the $15,000,000 process, many other important improvements were made during the conversion. A major modification was made to the stern, including a new counterbalanced rudder, new stern casting and struts, and new shorter propeller shafts and stern tubes. The latest in fueling and replenishment at sea equipment was also added, including kingposts with outriggers, ram tensioned span wires and high lines, electric hydraulic winches, cargo elevators, helicopter pickup area, and sliding blocks and cargo drop reels at replenishment stations. New electric pumps, larger cargo piping, and double-hose fueling rigs were also added, as well as a 4,500-kilowatt auxiliary diesel generator plant, and more enclosed stowage space. Habitability was also improved. Her \\"jumboization\\" complete, Navasota left the shipyard on 28 December 1964.  1965‚Äì75  After upkeep and training, Navasota steamed 20 August 1965 on her 16th Western Pacific deployment, arriving at Subic Bay on 11 September 1965 and returning to Long Beach on 6 June 1966. Navasota again steamed for the Western Pacific on 11 October 1966. Arriving at Subic Bay on 3 November 1966, she operated in the Gulf of Tonkin and in coastal waters off North and South Vietnam in support of United States Seventh Fleet warships conducting operations in the Vietnam War, with Subic Bay as her base of operations. The summer of 1967 brought the oiler back to Long Beach for upkeep and U.S. West Coast operations until she again deployed to the Western Pacific on 5 January 1968 to assume support duties for Seventh Fleet forces off Vietnam. Through at least 1970, she continued to deploy to the Western Pacific for six to eight months of each year, spending the remainder operating out of Long Beach as part of Service Force, Pacific Fleet, in support of United States First Fleet operations and Fleet Training Group, San Diego, California. Navasota was decommissioned on 13 August 1975 and transferred to the Military Sealift Command, in which she served as USNS Navasota (T-AO-106) until 1991.  Later career and disposition  Navasota began active service with the Military Sealift Command in 1975. She was taken out of service in 1991. Navasota was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 January 1992. She was sold for scrapping on 25 October 1995. Battle honors USS Navasota received nine battle stars for her Korean War service and 14 campaign stars for her Vietnam War service.

He was the founder of the socialist Centro de Investigacion Casa SUR. Biography Alberto Flores Galindo was born in Lima to a medium-class family. He spent his school years studying in the Lima private religious school Colegio La Salle. Later, he studied History at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.Ricardo Portocarrero, \\"Alberto Flores Galindo: la historia, la pol√≠tica y el socialismo\\" At age 22 he had already concluded his thesis on miners from Cerro de Pasco, which was graded as \\"outstanding.\\" This thesis was later published by the university in the form of a book. As a result of his studies, he obtained a scholarship from the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales of Paris. Upon returning to Peru he dedicated his time to university research at the Universidad Cat√≥lica, and also spent time as a reporter for newspapers and magazines. During the 1980s he founded SUR, the Casa de Estudios del Socialismo (House of Socialist Studies), and made it both an editorial house and a center of intellectual discussions. Moreover, he also founded the magazine Margenes and published it through SUR. He was a prolific historian and one of the most influent Peruvian leftist intellectuals of the 1980s. Flores Galindo constantly promoted various debates about Marxism through intellectual thought (La Agonia de Mariategui, 1980) and social history (Aristocracia y Plebe, 1984). In this last book he was inspired by the works of E.P. Thompson, an English Marxist historian. With this influence, he was able to analyze and understand Peruvian colonial society in terms of class, understanding class -much like Thompson- not as a thing in itself but as a set of relationships. Other major influences in his works came from Frantz Fanon, the French historians from the Annales School, and the Peruvians Jose Carlos Mariategui, Jose Maria Arguedas, and Jorge Basadre. The collection of essays entitled Buscando un Inca: Indentidad y Utopia en los Andes (Searching for an Inca: Identity and Utopia in the Andes), originally published in 1986, obtained the Premio Ensayo de Casa de las Americas in Cuba. With the book, Flores Galindo sought to formulate a link between socialist thought and Andean traditions. He was the first historian to write about racism in Peru through the 1988 version of Buscando un Inca in the chapter entitled Rep√∫blica sin Ciudadanos (Republic without Citizens).

From 1978-1995, he served as the first Jewish Chaplain at Phillips Academy, Andover. He has been described as the \\"father of Jewish environmentalism\\". Biography Gendler was born in Chariton, Iowa in 1928 to a religious Jewish family who moved to Des Moines in 1939. He graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School (Des Moines) and went on to earn a B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1948 during the heyday of Robert Hutchins‚Äô leadership. He remained at Chicago until 1951 studying with such luminaries as Rudolf Carnap. In 1957, he was ordained as a Conservative rabbi by the Jewish Theological Seminary. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gendler served as rabbi to a number of congregations throughout Latin America, including the Beth Israel Community Center in Mexico City, Mexico (1957‚Äì59), the Associacao Religiosa Israelita in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (1961), and the five congregations of Havana, Cuba (High Holidays and Passover, 1968‚Äì69). From 1962-1968, Gendler served as rabbi at the Jewish Center of Princeton, New Jersey. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Gendler, along with his wife Mary Gendler (born 1940) was involved in several alternative residential communities, including Ivan Illich‚Äôs Centro Intercultural de Documentaci√≥n in Cuernavaca, Mexico (1968-69) (alongside Harvey Cox ) and the inter-racial inter-religious living center Packard Manse in Stoughton, Massachusetts (1969-71). In 1971, Gendler became rabbi at Temple Emanuel of the Merrimack Valley and in 1977, Gendler was appointed by Ted Sizer as the first Jewish chaplain at Phillips Academy, Andover as part of a Catholic-Protestant-Jewish ‚Äútri-ministry‚Äù. Gendler remained in his position at Phillips Andover, alongside his position at Temple Emanuel of the Merrimack Valley, until his retirement, at the age of 67, in 1995. Since 1995, Gendler, along with his wife Mary Gendler, has been involved in community education work among the Tibetan exiles on Strategic Nonviolent Struggle. In 2007, they played a central role in the founding of the Active Nonviolence Education Center in Dharmasala, India. He is the father of two daughters, Tamar Gendler, who is Professor of Philosophy and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Yale University, and Naomi Gendler Camper, who is Chief Policy Officer at the American Bankers Association. Civil rights work Gendler became involved in the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-1950s, sparked by his involvement in the American Jewish Society for Service 1955 summer institute at the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee. During the 1960s, he played a pivotal role in involving American Jews in the movement, leading groups of American Rabbis to participate in prayer vigils and protests in Albany, Georgia (1962), Birmingham, Alabama (1963) and Selma, Alabama (1965), and persuading Abraham Joshua Heschel to participate in the famous march from Selma to Montgomery (1965) . Gendler was instrumental in arranging Martin Luther King‚Äôs important address to the national rabbinical convention on March 25, 1968, 10 days before King‚Äôs death, conducting what was to be the final interview with MLK. Gendler was also an early proponent in Judaism of equal rights for gays, women‚Äôs ritual participation, and Palestinian rights. Jewish nonviolence Gendler advocates the position that religious nonviolence is as much a part of Judaism as it is of other religions. His most widely distributed article on this topic is \\"Therefore Choose Life\\" anthologized in Roots of Jewish Nonviolence and The Challenge of Shalom. Gendler has served on the board of the Jewish Peace Fellowship and currently serves on the board of the Shomer Shalom Institute for Jewish Nonviolence. He has translated some of the nonviolent writings of Rabbi Aaron Samuel Tamaret into English. In 2013, he was honored with a Human Rights Hero Award by the T'ruah Foundation in recognition of a lifetime of work on behalf of nonviolence, human rights, the environment. Egalitarian Judaism Gendler was an early member of Havurat Shalom, a founding member of the Alternative Religious Community in Marblehead, Massachusetts, and an important contributor to numerous progressive Jewish liturgical prayerbooks, journals and anthologies. Jewish environmentalism During the 1960s and 1970s, inspired in part by the work and writings of his friends and mentors Helen and Scott Nearing, Gendler became involved in the conservation and environmental movements, and was an advocate and practitioner of organic farming and vegetarianism. In 1978, he installed the world‚Äôs first solar-powered eternal light on the roof of his Synagogue in Lowell Massachusetts. Over the next 30 years, he published dozens of articles on Jewish environmentalism and gave hundreds of lectures on the topic. In 2008, he received a ‚ÄúLifetime Achievement‚Äù award for his contributions to Jewish environmentalism from the Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center. In 2013, he was honored with the Presidents' Medallion from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in recognition of \\"a life of passionate devotion to humankind\\" and a \\"lifetime of commitment to social justice and environmentalism.\\" Also in 2013, his lifetime of work was recognized through the creation of the Gendler Grapevine Project, a six-year initiative designed to celebrate and perpetuate Gendler's life work, and serve as a permanent repository of his articles and teachings.

It was commissioned jointly by the grand vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha and his wife ƒ∞smihan Sultan. It was designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan and completed in 1571/2. The mosque is noted for the fine quality of the Iznik tiles that decorate the interior walls. History The mosque was designed by Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan for the grand vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha and his wife ƒ∞smihan Sultan, a daughter of Selim II and one of the granddaughters of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. According to the foundation inscription in Turkish above the north entrance to the courtyard, the building was completed in AH 979 (1571/72 CE). Although ƒ∞smihan Sultan and her husband jointly endowed the mosque, only Sokollu Mehmed Pasha is listed on the foundation inscription. Architecture Exterior The mosque is noted for its architecturally challenging location on a steep slope. Sinan resolved this issue by fronting the mosque with a two-storey courtyard. The bottom storey was divided into shops, whose rents were intended to help support the upkeep of the mosque. The upper storey with an open colonnaded courtyard had the spaces between the columns on three sides walled off to form small rooms, each with a small window, fireplace and niche to store bedding, forming the living accommodations for a madrasah. The fourth side of the courtyard is the mosque itself, which is designed as a hexagon inscribed in a rectangle, topped by a dome with four small semi-domes in the corners. The dome is in diameter and high. The ablution fountain in the courtyard has twelve columns supporting an onion shaped dome. The single minaret is placed at the northeast corner of the mosque. Interior The interior of the Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque is famous for the ƒ∞znik tiles, decorated with a wide variety of blue, red and green floral designs, with panels of calligraphy in white thuluth letters on a blue ground. The interior columns make use of polychrome marble. The minbar is made of white marble with a conical cap, sheathed in Iznik tiles. The windows above the mihrab have stained glass. Above the main entrance, framed by a gilded brass bezel, is a fragment of the Kaaba in Mecca; other fragments of this black stone are above the minbar and mihrab. As well as the tilework, parts of the mosque were originally painted. Most of the paintwork has been renovated but some of the original paintwork survives above the vestibule of the north entrance, on the brackets supporting the balcony above the entrance, and under the ceilings of the side galleries.

Biography Personal life Ian North was born in Brooklyn in 1952. He grew up in Long Island. He received his first guitar at age 12, but being virtually tone deaf, could not play any songs other than those he composed. In 1970, he slowly started to get serious about his artwork. North has four children. His first born son is artist Sammy thrashLife. Milk 'N' Cookies In 1973, North formed a power pop and glam outfit called Milk 'N' Cookies along Justin Strauss on vocals, Jay Weiss (replaced by Sal Maida, later in Roxy Music and Sparks) on bass and Mike Ruiz on drums (later in Paul Collins' Beat). While the album's release was initially delayed and largely ignored upon release, it has subsequently become a cult classic. After its reissue in 2005, the band headlined the Radio Heartbeat festival in 2007 without North. As younger bands that now claim Milk 'n' Cookies as an influence have gained in popularity, like Nobunny and Cheap Time, the band has garnered even more attention. In 2016, Captured Tracks released a 3xLP Milk 'N' Cookies boxset which included a book of liners featuring notes by members of Sonic Youth, Ramones, and Blondie. British punk and new wave scene: Radio and Neo After the split of Milk 'N' Cookies, North moved to England and formed Radio with Sparks bassist Martin Gordon and the Simon brothers, Paul and Robert. That group transformed to Neo after Gordon's departure (he joined Radio Stars) and changed line-ups, with North being the only remaining member until 1979, when his visa ended and he returned to New York. The same year, twelve Neo tracks were released in Britain by Aura Records as a North solo album, titled Neo. Return to USA and solo career Back in New York, North took to newly affordable synth technology and recording equipment, first on his debut full-length album as a solo artist, My Girlfriend's Dead, and then on his Rape of the Orchids EP. During this time he also produced material for The Fast; he also filled in as the band's bassist in the music videos for their songs Kids Just Wanna Dance and Love Me Like a Locomotive. From 1983 to 1993, North worked sporadically on the album Torch Songs & Arson. While the label originally slated to release the album folded in the decade over which it was created, it has since been made available for free download. In 2009, North ended the longest period of musical inactivity in his life, releasing the 12-song album, E Z Listening For Suicides, under the moniker \\"Darkjet\\".

It was based on the 1931 play of the same name by Jeffrey Dell, which was in turn based on the 1926 novel of the same name by C. S. Forester. Laughton also played the lead role in the play, which opened on Broadway on September 30, 1931 and ran for 70 performances.Internet Broadway Database Plot London bank clerk William Marble (Charles Laughton) is deeply in debt. When his boss learns of a lawsuit for an overdue bill, he warns Marble that he will be dismissed if he cannot settle the matter quickly. Then, Marble is visited by a rich nephew whom he has not seen in many years, James Medland (Ray Milland). All night, Marble tries to borrow money from him, having received a financial tip that could solve all his financial troubles. An increasingly uncomfortable Medland is not interested. Driven to desperation, Marble offers him a glass of whisky laced with cyanide, and under cover of darkness buries his body in the back yard. With the dead man's money, Marble speculates on margin and makes ¬£30,000, a large sum that enables him to retire. However, fear of his crime being discovered makes him consistently nervous and irritable. His wife Annie (Dorothy Peterson) knows something is wrong, but wrongly guesses he has embezzled from the bank. To relieve his nervous tension, he sends Annie and their daughter Winnie (Maureen O'Sullivan) away on a three-week vacation. While they are gone, he has an affair with Madame Collins (Verree Teasdale), a local shopowner. Winnie finds out when she returns a day early and discovers Collins in the house, but keeps quiet about it. Despite their new financial wealth, troubles continue to grow for the Marble family. When Annie sees a small advertisement in the newspaper asking for anyone who knows the whereabouts of Medland to contact a firm of solicitors, glances at the bottle of cyanide (originally bought by Marble for developing photographs), and one of his recently-acquired books about poison and its effects, she realises what her husband has done, but stands by him. Winnie becomes a bit of a snob, consorting with a higher social class of people and sneering at her parents. When she runs away one night, Annie chases after her in the rain and becomes very ill. However, under Marble's loving care, she begins to recover. Then Madame Collins shows up and blackmails Marble into giving her some money. Annie overhears and commits suicide with some of the same cyanide used to kill Medland. Marble is convicted for her murder. When a tearful Winnie visits him in his cell on the day of his execution, he reassures her that he did not kill Annie, but says that he is nonetheless at peace with his fate. He is convinced he is paying a bill that was only deferred. In the original novel, William and Annie also have a son John, who does not appear in the play or film.

It was the only major battle in the Russo-Georgian War. Georgian ground troops entered the city on early 8 August 2008, after an artillery assault. Georgians took control of most of the city in hours. Russian main forces began entering South Ossetia through the Roki tunnel. After being initially forced to withdraw, the Georgian troops made several attempts to retake the city. Due to the difficult logistics of the terrain, the arrival of Russian reinforcements was slow. After fierce fighting, Georgian troops were finally forced to withdraw from the city on the evening of 10 August. On 11 August, all Georgian troops left South Ossetia. Parts of Tskhinvali were devastated in the three-day fighting. Background Before the Battle On 5 August Lenta.ru reports 300 volunteers from North Ossetia arrived in South Ossetia, while mobilization of up to 2000 ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù and Cossacks began in the North Caucasus. The number of regular Russian troops in the region was increasing. On 7 August 2008, the Georgian authorities received foreign intelligence reports about movement of Russian troops towards the Roki tunnel. Russian troops had illicitly crossed the Russo-Georgian state border and advanced into South Ossetia by 7 August, before the Georgian military response. According to Der Spiegel, the Georgian tanks were to advance to the Roki Tunnel to seal it off. The Georgian aircraft's target was only the Gupta bridge, which links the northern part of South Ossetia to its southern part where Tskhinvali is located. The Georgian forces deployed on the South Ossetian border on 7 August included the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades, the Artillery Brigade, elements of the 1st Infantry Brigade, and the separate Gori Tank Battalion, plus special forces and Ministry of the Internal Affairs troops ‚Äì as many as 16,000 men, according to Moscow Defense Brief. International Institute for Strategic Studies and Western intelligence quoted by Der Spiegel give a lower estimate, saying that the Georgians had amassed by 7 August about 12,000 troops near South Ossetian administrative line and 75 tanks and armored personnel carriers near Gori. On the opposite side at the same time, there were said to be 500 regular Russian soldiers and 500 South Ossetian fighters ready to defend Tskhinvali, according to an estimate quoted by Der Spiegel. According to the materials that were made available to Independent International Fact-Finding Mission by South Ossetian authorities, the South Ossetian military forces consisted primarily of light rifle battalions with seconded artillery units and obsolete Soviet- made armoured vehicles. The total strength of the separatist military and law enforcement personnel, including reserve units which took part in the combat, was less than 3,500.IIFFMCG Vol. III, p. 520 Battle Georgian attack =Artillery preparation= Situation in South Ossetia before the war Tskhinvali after the battle. The sign (in Russian) reads \\"Secondary school #6\\". August 2008. At 23:35 on 7 August, Georgian artillery units began firing smoke shells into South Ossetia. Soon afterwards, at 23.50 Georgian artillery opened fire against fixed and moving enemy targets. The interval was supposed to allow the civilian population to leave dangerous areas.IIFFMCG Vol II, p. 209 The equipment used in the artillery assault included 27 rocket launchers, 152-millimetre guns, as well as cluster munitions. The commander of the Georgian peacekeepers, Mamuka Kurashvili, officially informed the Commander of Joint Peacekeeping Forces, major-general Marat Kulakhmetov, that Georgia began the military operation for establishment of constitutional order in South Ossetia. He assured their safety called for the Russian peacekeepers not to interfere, even though they had orders to shoot on Georgian forces. =Georgian advance= Russian peacekeepers base in Tskhinvali A BMP-2 of the Russian 58th Army in South Ossetia. Early on the morning of 8 August, Georgia launched a ground attack, as well as operations on the left and right flanks of Tskhinvali. The left flank operation was undertaken by the 4th Infantry Brigade coming from Vaziani, while the 3rd Infantry Brigade from Kutaisi took to the right flank. The aim of the flank operations was to occupy important heights around Tskhinvali and then, moving further northwards, to take control of the strategically important Gupta bridge and the roads, including the Ossetian-controlled Dzara by-pass road, leading from the Roki tunnel to Tskhinvali. This was done in order to block Russian troops from travelling through the tunnel to Tskhinvali. Georgian forces seized several South Ossetian villages located on higher ground around the city. The artillery of the 4th Brigade began to shell targets inside Khetagurovo at 00:40. 20 minutes later two of its light infantry battalions began to advance and quickly took the village of Muguti without a fight and then seized the village of Khetagurovo after a battle with an inferior South Ossetian force. Another battalion took several Ossetian border villages of the Znaur District to the west of the city without encountering resistance, while several villages of the Leningor District were quickly occupied without a fight by special forces of the Interior Ministry. After several hours of bombardment Georgian forces began to advance towards Tskhinvali. South Ossetian forces employed artillery and mortars against Georgian troops massed near the village of Zemo Nikozi, but the bombardment was ineffective. According to South Ossetian sources, a Georgian tank attack on the suburbs of the city was repelled by militia at 3:46 AM. At 4:00 AM, Georgian forces approaching Tskhinvali began engaging South Ossetian regular forces and militia. At first Georgian tanks shelled enemy positions from a safe distance, without entering the city. At dawn a special task-force of the Interior Ministry attempted to take the village of Kvaysa, west of Tskhinvali, but was repelled by a platoon of South Ossetian troops manning fortified positions, losing several wounded. At 6:00 AM, the Georgian 3rd Brigade launched an offensive into the Eredvi region, east of Tskhinvali, seizing villages and strategic vantage points. They soon encountered resistance from a company-sized South Ossetian force, firing from fortified positions at the Prisi Heights. After the heights near Tskhinvali were secured, Georgian military and police moved into the city. Their assault was supported by artillery and tanks.IIFFMCG Vol III, p. 60 Georgia says that the entry to Tskhinvali took place at 06:00 AM. The Russian peacekeepers' southern compound, manned by about 250 soldiers, laid in immediate vicinity of the entrance to the town. After Georgian troops approached the compound, an exchange of fire with Russian peacekeepers broke out. Georgian Cobra vehicles opened fire at the base with heavy machine guns. In response the Russians positioned three BMP-1 vehicles at the perimeter of the base. The Georgians then called in tank support and shortly after three T-72s from the Independent Combined Tank Battalion arrived. At 6:30, the tanks opened fire. The first shell destroyed an observation post on the roof of the compound, killing a Russian peacekeeper and a South Ossetian observer who were directing mortar fire against the advancing Georgian infantry. The tanks also shelled the three Russian BMP-1 vehicles stationed in front of the base, killing five of their crews and destroying the IFVs in the process. Among those dead were soldiers from the Russian 135th Motorized Infantry Regiment. During the engagement, one of the Georgian tanks, which was damaged by an RPG-7 rocket, became trapped in an irrigation ditch near the compound and was abandoned by its crew. The other two tanks pulled back and continued shelling the compound from a distance, and were soon joined by artillery and mortars. One Russian T-72B(M) got abandoned and destroyed as a result of shelling next to the Peacekeepers barracks. By 08:00 AM on 8 August, Georgian infantry and tanks had entered Tskhinvali and engaged in a fierce battle with Ossetian militia and the Russian peacekeeping battalion stationed in the city. 1,500 Georgian ground troops had reached the centre of Tskhinvali by 10 AM on 8 August. According to the Russian side, Georgian troops had captured the Southern Base of the Russian peacekeepers by 11:00 AM and were attempting to take the northern peacekeeper base. Georgian forces then sent in armored units to smash resistance offered by Russian peacekeepers and Ossetian militia.IIFFMCG Vol III, p. 370 The servicemen stationed at the northern base repelled five Georgian attacks and continued to engage overwhelming Georgian forces.IIFFMCG Vol III, p. 371 At this point, according to the Russian side, the peacekeepers suffered their first casualties: two servicemen killed and five wounded. Georgia maintains that it only targeted Russian peacekeepers in self-defence, after coming under fire from them.IIFFMCG Vol III, p. 69 At 12:15 AM on 8 August, the commander of the Russian JPKF peacekeepers, Marat Kulakhmetov, reported to the OSCE monitors that his unit had come under fire and that they had casualties. According to a top Russian military commander, over 10 Russian peacekeepers were killed during fighting in Tskhinvali. Georgian shelling had left some buildings of Tskhinvali in ruins. According to Der Spiegel, the peacekeepers' cafeteria was completely destroyed, and all of their buildings went up in flames. Russian TV showed damaged houses and apartment buildings in Tskhinvali. According to Ossetian source, Georgian troops burned down the South Ossetian Ministry of Culture and damaged Parliament. A number of apartment block buildings were set ablaze, and the streets were pocketed with numerous bomb craters. A Guardian reporter claimed that while some neighborhoods were intact, \\"there were patches of terrible destruction\\".

According to Western intelligence agencies quoted by Der Spiegel, the involvement of Russian regular forces began at 07:30 on 8 August, when Russia launched SS-21 short-range ballistic missiles against military and government bunker positions in the city Borjomi, southwest of Gori. The first Russian air attack was recorded two hours later, at around 09:30, on the village of Shavshvebi in the Gori District.IIFFMCG Vol III, p. 107 At 2:00 AM on 8 August, according to CAST, the Russian Army began to arrive in South Ossetia, when battalions from the 693rd and 135th Motorized Rifle Regiments began arriving in South Ossetia through the Roki Tunnel. Individual platoons began securing positions on the road from the Roki Tunnel to Tskhinvali, so as to ensure the safe entry of additional Russian forces into the region. According to Russia, the Security Council of South Ossetia appealed to Russia at around 11:00 on 8 August, requesting help.IIFFMCG Vol III, p. 342 According to Moscow Defense Brief, on the morning of 8 August, the Russian government made a decision to conduct an operation to prevent Georgia from seizing the territory of South Ossetia. Russia claimed to have responded to an attack on the peacekeepers and to be defending South Ossetian civilians. Russia claimed that its aim was \\"peace enforcement\\". Russia accused Georgia of committing \\"genocide\\". Russian authorities claimed that the civilian casualties in Tskhinvali amounted up to 2,000. These high casualty figures were later revised down to 162 casualties as of 23 December 2008. A captain in the 135th Regiment, Denis Sidristy, said in the interview published by Krasnaya Zvezda that his unit had been ordered to move to Tskhinvali on 7 August. Sidristy said that he witnessed the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali around midnight. According to a senior Russian official, General Uvarov, the first Russian combat unit, the First Battalion of the 135th Motorized Rifle Regiment, was ordered at around dawn of 8 August to move through the Roki Tunnel. According to him, the unit did not pass through the tunnel until 2:30 PM. According to him, it reached Tskhinvali in the next evening, having met heavy resistance from Georgians. Georgia disputed the account, saying that it was in heavy combat with Russian forces near the tunnel long before dawn of 8 August. According to Der Spiegel, Russian troops did not begin marching through the tunnel until roughly 11 AM on 8 August. According to the Georgian account, the first Russian units crossed the tunnel at 5:30 on 8 August, passed through Java and proceeded to advance on Tskhinvali, using the Dzara road. The first motorcade of Russian tanks, armored vehicles and ammunition trucks reached Tskhinvali at 18:44 and opened fire on the Georgian forces in the city and surrounding heights. The second motorcade, which also came from Russia via the Roki tunnel, was stopped near the Georgian-controlled area of Dmenisi, 7 kilometers north of Tskhinvali, and the Russians commenced heavy fire on Georgian forces. The Russian artillery fire against Georgian forces in and around Tskhinvali reportedly included Grad bombardament as well causing more collateral damage. The main Russian ground forces belonged to the 58th Army and were veterans of the Second Chechen War. The 58th Army was reinforced by the 76th Guards Air Assault Division. Cossacks also moved in to combat the Georgians as well. =Air operations in South Ossetia= Russian aircraft started flying missions in the early hours of 8 August and targeted Georgian air defence installations in the Gori district. Aircraft types employed during the war included the Sukhoi Su-24, Sukhoi Su-25, Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29.IIFFMCG Vol II, p. 216 According to Der Spiegel, the Russian air force managed to establish air superiority. However, according to the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (CAST), Russia never gained air superiority in the South Ossetian theatre, as the Russian Air Force took early losses (three Su-25s) to Georgian anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to stop making sorties for two days. Citing eyewitness reports, CAST writes that \\"... there were no Russian aircraft over Tskhinvali on August 8 or the following day ‚Äî that is. during the most critical period of the conflict. In effect, the Russian military command was forced to bring motor-rifle units into battle from the march, without first gaining superiority in numbers and firepower.\\" Russian aviation only reappeared on 10 August. The Georgian troops had at least one battalion of relatively modern Buk-M1 self-propelled SAM systems, at least two battalions (a total of eight units) of Osa-AK self-propelled SAM systems and six to ten of the upgraded Osa-AKM version. The Georgian army managed to deploy strong air defenses right in the conflict zone. During the early stages of the battle, the loss of two Russian aircraft, a Sukhoi Su-25 and a Tupolev Tu-22M, was admitted by Anatoliy Nogovitsyn of the Russian General Staff. The fate of their pilots was unknown then. Reuters reported that one Russian pilot was probably taken prisoner. South Ossetia claimed that its soldiers shot down two Georgian aircraft. The Russian Air Force made around 200 sorties during the war, including missions in Georgia proper. Due to the lack of night-vision equipment, it mostly operated during daytime, while the Georgian Air Force was able to operate at night as well. However the Georgian airforce was rendered immobile one day into the conflict when Russian planes impaired the airstrips. Problems in suppressing Georgian air defences (partly due to lack of training in this role), meant that the Russian air force was initially unable to provide direct support to its own troops. Moscow Defense Brief strongly criticised the performance of the Russian Air Force, saying that there was a total absence of co-operation between the army and air force, and that of the six Russian aircraft lost during the war, of which according to them, half were downed by friendly fire. =Georgian advance is stopped= By the afternoon of 8 August, Georgian forces had captured large parts of Tskhinvali, but had been unable to take the Northern quarter and a part of the city centre. However, the Georgians were meeting heavy resistance from the opposite side, including from Russian air force and artillery. At around 2:00 PM, a Georgian T-72 tank with its entire crew was destroyed by General Barankevich. Several minutes later on the same street, the South Ossetian militia hit another two Georgian T-72 tanks. Almost simultaneously with the destruction of the three Georgian tanks, a pair of two Russian Su-25 aircraft raided the Georgian positions in the western outskirts of Tskhinvali, killing more than 20 Georgian soldiers. The Georgian battalion fled in panic and left behind its dead and much of the equipment, including at least three T-72 tanks. Georgian flank operations were unsuccessful in their goal of blocking the Gupta Bridge and the main routes leading to Tskhinvali from the Roki Tunnel and Java base. A Georgian air attack against the Gupta bridge reportedly damaged it, but the bridge was quickly repaired.IIFFMCG Vol II, p. 210 Russian special units reportedly prevented Georgian saboteurs from blowing up the Roki Tunnel, which could have hindered the Russian military operations, as the capacity of the other roads was not sufficient. =Fighting between Georgian and Russian forces= Parliament of South Ossetia, after the fighting Later on 8 August, according to Moscow Defense Brief, three tactical battalion groups from the 135th, 503rd and 693rd Motorized Rifle Regiments of the 19th Motorized Rifle Division (based in Vladikavkaz) of the 58th Army of the North Caucasus Military District were deployed in battle formation to Java and Gufta and by the end of the day had pushed Georgian forces from the roads and heights around Dzari, Kverneti and Tbeti areas and as far as the western edge of Tskhinvali. Experiencing growing resistance, the Georgian forces withdrew from the centre of Tshkinvali but still held their positions in the southern parts of the town. They were regrouped and reinforced by the 2nd Infantry Brigade from Senaki. Reportedly, the 4th Brigade reinforced the Ministry of Interior special troops in Tshkinvali, while positions and objectives of the 4th Brigade on the left flank were transferred to the 2nd Brigade. During the evening of 8 August, vicious fighting reportedly took place in the area of Tskhinvali. Official military casualties, as reported on 8 August, were claimed to be 30 Georgians and Moscow claimed 21 Russian soldiers had lost their lives so far. Russian media reported that exchanges of fire between Russian and Georgian troops continued throughout the night. The passage of Russian forces through the narrow Roki Tunnel and along the mountain roads was slow and the Russians had difficulties in concentrating their troops, forcing them to bring their forces into battle battalion by battalion. In the afternoon of 9 August, the regrouped Georgian troops tried to regain their control of position in Tskhinvali. The Georgians launched several attacks, including some with tanks. The assault was met with resistance and the Georgians suffered losses, forcing them to withdraw. Because of the gradual increase in troops, the amassed Russian forces in South Ossetia outnumbered the Georgians by nearly two to one on 9 August. In total, the Russians moved between 5,500 and 10,000 troops to South Ossetia through the Roki Tunnel, according to Der Spiegel. =The ambush= On 9 August, a 30 vehicles strong convoy led by Russia's 58th Army commander Lieutenant General Anatoly Khrulyov moved into Tskhinvali from the Roki Tunnel and got shelled by artillery and tanks near the entrance of the town. When pushing further they were encircled and ambushed by special forces. Simultaneously a mixed force of police and military had regrouped at Zemo Nikosi and were launching another assault into Tskhinvali. The effort was supported by the 2nd Infantry Brigade which was held in reserve. While the main offensive failed due to counterattacks and air raids which took out communication, the Georgian special forces proceeded in systematically decimating the trapped Russian convoy. They were subsequently supported by some of the infantry and police elements moving into the area. The Russian side speculates that the general's capture was a primary goal of the Georgians however they have made no such claim. The Georgian attack was opportunistic. General Khrulyov was already carried from the battlefield when he got wounded in his vehicle by the earlier shelling. Two Russian journalists that accompanied the unit and witnessed the spectacle were wounded in the ensuing firefight and evacuated as well. A Russian major named Denis Vetchinov took command over the remaining forces and created a defense perimeter. Vetchinov is credited with killing a Georgian soldier or special police officer with a captured machine gun while being wounded in both legs. Later, he was hit in the head while providing suppressive fire and died en route to hospital. Vetchinov was awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation posthumously. The trapped Russian units avoided complete destruction by splitting into smaller platoons and scatter, however reportedly 25 out of 30 vehicles of that vanguard force were destroyed. Despite the heavy losses at around 5 AM on 9 August, according to a Russia Today timeline, a Russian unit broke through to the camp of the besieged peacekeepers and started evacuating the wounded. At that point the Georgian troops had already withdrawn and were preparing for another assault. =Turning point and Georgian withdrawal= A building in Tskhinvali on 18 August. A damaged apartment building in Tskhinvali The Georgian troops maintained the tactical initiative on the outskirts of Tskhinvali throughout 9 August and even during 10 August. By the morning of 10 August, the Georgians had captured almost the whole of Tskhinvali, forcing the Ossetian forces and Russian peacekeeping battalion to retreat to the northern reaches of the city. However, Moscow Defense Brief writes: ... on this very day the accumulation of Russian forces in the region finally bore fruit, and the fighting in South Ossetia reached a turning point. Toward the evening of August 10, Tskhinvali was completely cleared of Georgian forces, which retreated to the south of the city. Georgian forces were also repelled from the key Prisi heights. The bulk of Georgia‚Äôs artillery was defeated. Meanwhile, Ossetian forces, with the support of Russian divisions, took Tamarasheni, Kekhvi, Kurta, and Achabeti on the approach to Tskhinvali from the north. Georgian forces in several of Georgian enclaves were eliminated. According to Moscow Defense Brief, Georgian artillery continued shelling Tskhinvali. South Ossetian government representative claimed that Georgian troops opened the irrigation canal to flood basements and prevent civilians from seeking shelter. The then Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili ordered a general ceasefire on August 10 effectively halting all Georgian military operations while the Russian forces continued moving against any opposition. By the end of 11 August South Ossetia was completely cleared of Georgian forces. During the withdrawal, the Georgian 4th Mechanised Infantry Brigade was bombarded by Russian aircraft and the unit suffered heavy casualties. Small isolated Georgian units continued resistance. The Russian advance was briefly halted near the villages of Zemo-Nikozi and Shindisi, with the Russians losing a T-72B with its entire crew and a BMD-2 in fighting with retreating Georgian infantry elements, but continued after Chechen units cleared Zemo-Nikosi. A controversial engagement took place in the village of Shindisi which was being occupied by Russian forces when a Georgian Sapper convoy of the 2nd Light Infantry Brigade was allowed to pass the village as major engagements ceased at that point. The lightly armed unit was transported with Landrovers and trucks. In what is being described as either confusion or by the Georgian side a calculated move, the Engineer group got surrounded and attacked as soon as it reached an abandoned railway station. All vehicles were destroyed and 17 Georgian soldiers killed during the fight, while 5 servicemen partially wounded managed to escape and were sheltered and nursed by the local residents who hid them from the Russian army. According to Russian accounts, the convoy was attacked when it passed a Russian mechanised unit and the Russian soldiers reacted by attacking it. Later that day the local Georgian priests requested to retrieve the dead soldiers bodies which was initially denied but shortly after allowed by the Russian commander in charge. According to the Russian CAST, what stopped the Georgian advance in the end was not the Russian Air Force, but the resistance offered by peacekeepers and lightly armed, poorly organized South Ossetian units located in Tskhinvali. The Georgian troops failed to take Tskhinvali because they were not prepared psychologically for severe urban warfare. According to Georgian officials as well as Georgian military claims Russian air sorties effectively undermined all major military efforts by destroying most communication assetts and targeting crucial rally points. The Georgian army also suffered its heaviest casualties during the withdrawal by Russian air attacks. The Georgian Defence Minister later acknowledged, that the Georgian military tried to push into Tskhinvali three times in all. During the last attempt, they got a very heavy counterattack which Georgian officers described as \\"something like hell.\\" In total, the fighting in the Tskhinvali area lasted for three days and nights. An estimated 10,000‚Äì11,000 soldiers took part in the general Georgian offensive in South Ossetia. Of those over 40 were killed in combat mainly in and around Tskhinvali while more than 120 fell to air attacks, ambushes and artillery bombardment, mostly during the retreat. Hundreds were wounded and dozens captured. The fighting throughout South Ossetia lasted for four days. Having retreated from South Ossetia, the Georgian forces regrouped at Gori. Associated Press reported that a Russian Army Colonel said he had orders not to move his troops deeper into Georgia. \\"We are staying here,\\" he claimed. Aftermath and assessments Human Rights Watch reported that the Georgian forces used Grad rockets, self-propelled artillery, mortars, and howitzers during the attack. The South Ossetian parliament building along with several schools and nurseries were used as defence positions or operational posts by South Ossetian forces and volunteer militias. Georgian artillery fire targeted and hit these buildings. In many of the shelled villages, Ossetian militia positions were in close proximity to civilian houses. Georgia said that the attacks only intended to \\"neutralize firing positions from where Georgian positions were being targeted.\\" HRW documented the witnesses stating that civilian objects were used by South Ossetian forces, thus rendering them legitimate military targets. HRW concluded that South Ossetian forces were responsible for endangering civilians by setting up defensive positions in close vicinity of or directly inside civilian structures. Georgia was also responsible for the indiscriminate nature of its attacks and insufficient focus on minimizing risk to civilians. According to South Ossetian and Russian media reports, the Russian forces also shelled Tskhinvali with Grad rocket launchers. Tskhinvali Hospital's doctor, interviewed by Human Rights Watch, spoke of 273 wounded, both military and civilians, and 44 dead bodies being brought to the hospital, supposedly the majority of people killed in the city. Patients had to be moved into the basement during the fighting and the hospital itself was damaged by a rocket. Several journalists were reported to be among the casualties, including the two, who were embedded with the ambushed Russian armoured column, in which General Khrulyov was wounded.

L. Kenyon, from a 1918 publication. Camilla E. L. Kenyon (May 15, 1876 - September 25, 1957) was an American author of two novels and several short works. Her first novel was Spanish Doubloons, originally published in 1919 by Bobbs Merrill, also serialized in Munsey's Magazine and republished in a less-costly hardback edition by the A. L. Burt Company. This lively story of a group of treasure hunters on a Pacific island is told from the first person viewpoint of the heroine. It is widely available today as a free e-book from numerous sites, and it has also been reprinted in a paperback edition. Career Among her reviews for Spanish Doubloons was Publishers Weekly in 1920, which said \\"...\\"From the first page the reader never doubts that all will be well at the last page and is therefore able to enjoy terrible predicaments and deadly perils that beset this latest of treasure seekers...\\". Her second novel was Fortune At Bandy's Flat, published by Bobbs Merrill in 1921. The Sketch also said of the book \\"Spanish Doubloons has the full thrill of its name and something extra. Miss Camilla Kenyon has given a jolly turn to the treasure-hunt yarn...\\". The Milwaukee Sentinel also reviewed Spanish Doubloons and mentioned it was sold for only $1.50 at the time. Spanish Again told in the first person, by the eighteen-year-old heroine, this is a story of romance and adventure set in the fictional Sierra mountains hamlet of Bandy's Flat, a community where gold was mined years earlier. This book has also been reprinted and is currently available in paperback. Camilla Kenyon's first known publication was a 1904 magazine article entitled \\"A Sierra Summer\\", which appeared in Out West‚ÄîA Magazine of the Old Prairie and the New, and was included in a hardbound collection of issues, Volume XXI, July‚ÄìDecember 1904. Her next known publication was of a poem, \\"Departures,\\" which appeared in McClure's magazine in 1910. In the period from April 1917 to November 1918, she published six stories in magazines, as follows: in Munsey's Magazine, March, 1917, her short story \\"The Second Generation\\" appeared. In Sunset magazine, April 1917, the short story \\"Tuesday\\" was published. In Sunset Magazine, May 1917, her short story \\"The Runaways\\" appeared. Her story \\"Treasure From The Sea\\" appeared in the October 1917 Sunset magazine. A two- part short story, \\"Nanny and her Lordship,\\" appeared in the Sunset magazines for September and October, 1918. In November, 1918, her story \\"The Camofleurs\\" was published and both \\"Dust and Ashes\\" and \\"Claudia and the Conquering Hero\\" the following year in Sunset Magazine, which during this period was headquartered in San Francisco. She also appeared at Sunset's \\"Rodeo of Literary Lions\\" on February 19, 1919. That year, she also published a story in the Guy E. Morton book Balking the Bootlegger, a book about the methods followed for detecting the illegal sale of liquor which Maclean's called \\"interesting and amusing\\". In 1922, her short The Candor of Augusta Claire appeared in Scribner's Magazine. In April 1923, a novella of hers entitled The House In The Hollow was published in Munsey's Magazine. This mystery and romance story is set in the fictional California coastal town of Briones, and is told in the third person. In addition to the works listed above, a 1933 novel entitled Dark Hollow was published in England by Grayson and Grayson, with the author given as Camilla Kenyon. It has not so far been established whether this later work is by the same Camilla Kenyon who was the author of Spanish Doubloons and Fortune At Bandy's Flat. No verifiable information on the life of Camilla Kenyon the author is available. (Note that there was an American painter of the same name. She is a different individual). She was also a frequent attendee and speaker at events across Berkeley, California in the 1920s, including the historic St. John's Presbyterian Church. and, into the 1940s, she also taught creative writing classes in Oakland, California. Some websites regarding magazine fiction stories of the early 1900s state that Camilla Kenyon was born in San Francisco in 1876, but there is no factual confirmation currently available for this point.

It was issued as a radio single in promotion of his second studio album, Voodoo (2000). Written and produced by D'Angelo and Raphael Saadiq, the song was originally composed as a tribute to musician Prince. \\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\" contains a vintage style and sound similar to that of Prince's early musical work. The song's lyrics concern a man's plea to his lover for sex. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics and it earned D'Angelo a number of awards. \\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\" also earned notice for its controversial music video. Directed by Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier, the video consists entirely of one shot featuring a muscular D'Angelo appearing nude and lip-synching to the track. While initial reaction from viewers was divided with praise for its sexuality and accusations of sexual objectification, the video received considerable airplay on music video networks such as MTV and BET, and it helped increase mainstream notice of D'Angelo and Voodoo. The music video for \\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\" had a considerable impact on D'Angelo's recording career, as it helped engender an image of him as a sex icon to a younger generation of fans. However, his discontent with this image led to his period of absence from the music scene following the conclusion of the supporting tour for Voodoo. The song won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B; Vocal Performance at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. Rolling Stone magazine named \\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\" the fourth best single of 2000. The magazine later named it the fifty-first best song of the 2000s (decade).  Background and recording  \\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\" was originally intended as a tribute to influential musician Prince.

As an homage to the musician, Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson, record producer for Voodoo, described the song as \\"finding the line between parody and honesty ... In an era of 'the cover song', redoing a Prince song was taboo. This is the second best thing\\". Production of the song was handled by D'Angelo and fellow neo soul musician Raphael Saadiq, who also contributed with bass and musical arrangements during recording in 1999.Track listing and credits as per liner notes for Voodoo album The session took place at Electric Lady Studios, the recording studio originally built by influential rock musician Jimi Hendrix.Columnist.

Raphael Saadiq's electric guitar interplay throughout the song is reminiscent of the guitar style of Jimi Hendrix, as well as the \\"Maggot Brain\\" sound featured on the early work of Funkadelic. The song features a drum pattern with a uniform dynamic, which gives the impression of a live drummer playing in accordance to the sound of a drum machine. Overdubbing of D'Angelo's vocals, a contemporary R&B; recording technique prominently used on the rest of Voodoo, was implemented a number of times during production in order to provide the sound of a choir singing harmonies during the choruses, all of which are sung by D'Angelo. The song begins with drummer D'Angelo's off-beat, cross-snare clicks on the two and four beat with a messy kick.McPherson, Steve. Warp + Weft: Voodoo. Reveille Magazine. Retrieved on 2009-09-02. Music critic Steve McPherson noted that its first two measures sound \\"like a disaster\\", contrasting its solid groove. While most musical compositions rely on tension and release, which can be produced by factors such as soft verses and loud choruses, gradual buildup, subtle tension within verses or over the course of the bridge, or harmonic tension in chords that provides space for improvisation, D'Angelo's arrangements subdivide the tension into each moment of the song. According to McPherson, this results in \\"no linear way to measure how far off things slide before they pull themselves back ... can't be measured in beats or fractions of beats in a meaningful way. For lack of a less clich√©d word, it's entirely 'feel'\\". Similar to most of the song's album, Voodoo, \\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\" has this syncopation style as its center. D'Angelo's casual vocal style follows the same concept, applying it to melody, harmony, and phrasing, and is accompanied by falsetto climbs and skittery phrasing similar to Prince's singing. Prior to the final chorus section, \\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\" features a song-spanning dynamic after the bridge and guitar break that is accompanied by minor Rhodes piano and guitar chords, while the multi-tracked vocals are implemented as background whispers. Arrangements for the song are stripped back for an emphasis on vocals, leading to an enormous choral climax accompanied by overdriven electric guitar. On the song's final chorus section, critic Steve McPherson wrote \\"after it hits a peak, it keeps rising, the chorus of voices fizzing into overdrive and the whole track gradually succumbing to a wash of reverb\\".

Music video   Production  The song's music video was directed and produced in one day at a soundstage in New York City by director Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier, D'Angelo's manager at the time. The project was originally designed as a part of Trenier's promotional strategy to transform D'Angelo's image and public appeal. On the video's concept, Trenier stated, \\"the idea was, it would feel like one-on-one with whoever the woman was.\\" D'Angelo, who had been under intense physical workout with personal trainer Mark Jenkins, was initially anxious to appear naked in the video upon hearing Trenier's proposal. In a 2008 interview for Spin, Jenkins discussed D'Angelo's reluctance at the time to the idea for the video, stating \\"You've got to realize, he'd never looked like that before in his life. To somebody who was so introverted, and then, in a matter of three or four months, to be so ripped-everything was happening so quickly.\\" The video features a chiseled and muscular D'Angelo, wearing a small gold-chained crucifix necklace, lip-synching while filmed on a platform from the waist-up and appearing nude; he was wearing a pair of pajama bottoms during filming, which were not visible in the video as they were hung low away from the camera's view. Trenier later explained the idea of D'Angelo appearing alone, stating \\"We didn't want an on-screen love interest.

The music video gained a significant amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks, as it increased mainstream notice and appeal of D'Angelo upon the release of Voodoo in January 2000. Viewer response to the \\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\\" music video was largely divided along sexual lines, as female viewers generally expressed favor to the video. Additionally, D'Angelo's video appearance, including a notable amount of sweating around his abdomen, contributed to rumors of him receiving oral sex in the video.Drumming, Neil. Review: Voodoo.

In her response to the video, television personality Star Jones said that, \\"D'Angelo is singing about being intimate with a woman that he loves, and it's just basic voice and body, and when you're in an intimate situation with a man, that's really all that's there ‚Äî the voice and the body and the light hitting the body in a way that makes you know that this is your man\\". Danyel Smith, editor for Time Inc. at the time, said \\"It's so sexy. It's about time that girls had something luscious to look at while they're listening to a song. For years, men have been treated to breasts and butts along with their favorite songs, and women have had to just sit there and endure.\\" In an interview for The New York Times, Smith also said that she had encountered an appreciative reaction among women to the adult sexuality of the music video. She continued, recalling her experience at a salon where the video was viewed, stating: Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, reaction from most male viewers was negative. The music video was presented to a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party \\"recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel ‚Äî I don't want to see that gay stuff'\\". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating \\"Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do we have to look at that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity\\". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating \\"With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool\\".  Critical response  Critical opinion of the music video was generally favorable. Entertainment Weeklys columnist Jim Farber gave the music video an A rating, and called the close- ups of D'Angelo's physique a \\"measure of the video's smarm-free joy that even though the camera puts the viewer in the pleasure-giving position, we feel in no way manipulated or debased\\". Farber also lauded the video's depiction of sexuality, stating \\"it feels like a privilege to be part of such a comfortable act of carnality. Was it good for you, too?\\". A columnist for Billboard magazine shared a similar sentiment about the video, writing that \\"it's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it.

The commercial impact of the video and its heavy rotation on music video networks, however, led to D'Angelo's building image as a sex icon to a younger generation of music fans. Despite the publicity surrounding Voodoo being escalated by the video's appeal, the appeal of the album was almost overshadowed, commercially, by the video.H.W. Wilson Co. (2001), pp. 36‚Äì39.

Accessed online 9 August 2008. named for the Roman farmer and statesman Cincinnatus, the NOOC was founded in September 1933 by approximately 10 young men including Seattle attorney Ralph Bushnell Potts.; Potts gives a detailed account of discussions beginning in August leading to formal founding in September. Potts, who Richard C. Berner describes as the \\"prime mover and first commander\\" of the NOOC, had resigned from the presidency of the Consolidated Republican Clubs of King County to start the group. The NOOC's idealistic, mostly middle-class professional supporters reacted against both political corruption and labor unionism. They required the candidates they supported to disaffiliate from the established political parties and to limit campaign contributions to US$25. A May 1934 NOOC leaflet called for a \\"rebirth of political idealism among the younger citizens of America‚Ä¶ [T]he major political parties have become nothing but job-hunting cliques‚Ä¶ Cincinnatus advocates a Spartan-like devotion to honesty, efficiency, and ability in government.\\"Frederick G. Hamley Papers, University of Washington Library, Box 18-1, quoted in The group called for a reduction of 40% in Seattle city taxes, in a context where the city had already made large cuts: by the time the NOOC had a significant foothold on the city council, opposing councilman James Scavotto could argue that the city had already cut operating costs 50% in five years. The NOOC also advocated a vastly increased state-level police constabulary, with no intermediate levels between the state and municipalities. This police force would consist entirely of men under age 40, trained by a State Police School, and enlisting for a military-style four-year term rather than being free to resign at any time. The NOOC restricted its membership to men ages 21 to 35, indicates that those who \\"enlisted\\" before the age of 35 were allowed to remain members until they turned 40, and that there was eventually a notion of \\"auxiliary\\" status for older men and for women. and was organized along military lines to the point of resembling a fascist organization. By December 1933, Potts had built the NOOC into an organization with 17 divisions in Washington State each headed by a \\"captain\\"; statewide officers were \\"majors\\" and \\"colonels\\". In early 1934, 50 Cincinnatans marched to city hall to file three candidate petitions for city council, all of them dressed in white shirts and green and yellow headpieces (the colors of Seattle's Roosevelt High School). They used a slightly rewritten version of Sigmund Romberg's \\"Stout Hearted Men\\" as their anthem. This \\"proto-fascist\\" style was a matter of tension within the organization from the outset. NOOC councilman Frederick Hamley's diary indicates that he and his fellow councilman David Lockwood generally disliked this aspect of the group and focused mainly on local municipal issues. In February 1934 they and others defeated a proposal that the members of the organization should routinely stand and salute Potts when he entered the room. History in Seattle 1934 NOOC formed in September 1933. The next month they demanded the resignation of King County Commissioner John C. Stevenson (born John C. Stockman). Stevenson had avoided extradition to New York, where he was wanted for stock fraud; the NOOC further accused him of mismanagement of the county relief. They failed, but the attention gained encouraged them to run candidates for public office themselves. David Lockwood, Wellington Rhinehart, and Lloyd Johnson filed to run in the February 1934 primaries. Their total campaign budget was less than US$600. Seattle City Council offices are officially nonpartisan, and there is no official acknowledgment or a party or ticket. These three NOOC candidates in 1934 got around this by all listing \\"Cincinnatus\\" as their middle names on the ballot, which the election officials permitted. In this period, three of the nine Seattle City Council positions were up for election each year, with the top six candidates in the primary election going on to a general election. The NOOC candidates were supported by the Washington Taxpayers Council, as was conservative incumbent John E. Carroll. Of the Cincinnatans, only Lockwood made it through the primaries,According to , Lockwood came in sixth in the primary, just making the cut; the other Cincinnatus candidates were in two of the next four places, out of a field of 35. but he gained office despite a complete lack of newspaper endorsements, coming in second in the general election.That is according to . says he came in first and had the second- highest vote total recorded up to that time by any councilmanic candidate. He took office in June amidst the Maritime Strike of 1934, which had led to lethal violence in Seattle.BOLA Architecture + Planning & Northwest Archaeological Associates, Inc., Port of Seattle North Bay Project DEIS: Historic and Cultural Resources , Port of Seattle, April 5, 2005, p. 13 (page 15 of the PDF). Accessed online 25 July 2008. Elected mayor at the same time Lockwood joined the council was Charles William Smith. Smith and his police chief, W. B. Kirtley, undoubtedly tolerated Seattle's then-longstanding police corruption. Lockwood further accused Smith of profiting personally from this corruption and tied Smith's toleration of corruption to his toleration of a growing budget deficit. Among the remedies he proposed were a fixed term for police chiefs, making the chief more independent of the mayor (and thereby separating the mayor from any system of police payoffs). Carried away by their success in Seattle and the interest in forming other chapters around the state, the NOOC contested the statewide November elections. Among their candidates were William J. Wilkins for U. S. Senate, Cecil R. Fuller for the 1st District congressional seat, and John W. Day for King County Prosecutor. Running with great enthusiasm but very little budget, they did not elect anyone, but did have the best third-party results of any slate since the Bull Moosers in 1912. 1935 In the 1935 election, the NOOC ran only two candidates for the three available city council seats, endorsing former PTA president Mildred Powell for the third seat. Originally the two NOOC candidates were to be Frederick Hamley and Leo Mortland, but the latter was a bit too enthusiastic in identifying as a Republican. When he gleefully announced his endorsement by the 36th District Republican Club, the NOOC decided he was no longer their candidate and replaced him with Arthur Langlie (although Langlie was never an official member of the NOOC). Incumbents William Gaines, Frank Fitts, and David Levine chose to campaign jointly, with the backing of the Central Labor Council and the newly formed Washington Commonwealth Federation. They accused the NOOC of being a \\"secret organization\\" and intending to impose a \\"fascist dictatorship\\". Nonetheless, Langlie and Frederick Hamley led in the primaries, followed by the incumbents; the sixth candidate was the NOOC-endorsed Powell. This time, Langlie and Hamley gained the endorsements of all three major dailies. Of the incumbents, only Levine secured any such endorsement, from the Seattle Star. Langlie and Hamley came in as the top two in the general election. Powell was also elected. It was Levine's only defeat in a political career lasting more than three decades.Seattle City Council Members, 1869-Present Chronological Listing. Accessed online 9 August 2008.\\"David Levine, former city councilman, dies\\", Seattle Times, May 9, 1972, p. C15.\\"David Levine, Long Active On City Council\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 10, 1972. Because of some resignations, Langlie and Hamley took office immediately after the election. Secure in the knowledge that they needed only one other council vote to override any mayoral veto, the three NOOC council members used these council positions to investigate corruption and to reduce city spending. Lockwood updated proposals he already had for a central purchasing office and a central garage; he also framed a response to municipally owned Seattle City Light's proposal to buy out the Seattle operations of the Puget Sound Power and Light Company, which the NOOC opposed. Hamlie and Langlie were assigned to investigate the city's street railway system, which was in chronic financial trouble,Peterson, Lorin & Davenport, Noah C. (1950), Living in Seattle, Seattle: Seattle Public Schools, p. 145-146. and the police department. As they turned up substantial evidence of police corruption, it became clear that Powell would also be interested in proposals to reform the police. The council voted 5 to 4 for a budget that would cut 120 city jobs, mainly in the police and fire departments and public schools. Mayor Smith vetoed this, and his veto was sustained because Powell opposed the school cuts. The city budget was put on hold until September. Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer attacked Mayor Smith for running a \\"wide open\\" city, for refusing to make cuts in the departments controlled by the mayor's office, for being associated with a corrupt police-based political machine, and for a recent upsurge in illegal gambling, prostitution, and Sunday liquor sales. The P-I was not alone in these views: The Argus compared Smith to the legendarily corrupt Hiram Gill and the United States Navy made it known that they were considering placing the entire city of Seattle off limits for sailors on leave. Further condemnations of this state of affairs came from the Clean Government League, the Morals Committee of the Council of Churches, and the Philippine-American Chronicle, which published detailed expos√©s of the \\"Chinese Gambling Syndicate\\" and the police's policy of closing down only the \\"small fry\\". In hearings, Chief W. B. Kirtley argued that the police were expending a great deal of effort dealing with numerous labor strikes and could hardly stand staff cuts. He acknowledged that the police made a \\"liberal construction\\" of city ordinances but said that he opposed \\"fanatical enforcement of the laws\\". He hinted broadly that some of the pillars of the church who opposed gambling actually profited from it as landlords, and might not be pleased with zealous enforcement. When talked of the material difficulty of raiding gambling dens (which usually had effective routes of escape), the Cincinnatans insisted on his accompanying them out of the hearing room to the openly operating Battersby and Smith's card room near First Avenue and Madison Street. Kirtley could hardly deny the evidence in front of his eyes: he ordered police to trash the establishment and to confiscate the money. None of the confiscated money ever made it to the police evidence room. 1936 and after All of this was dramatic, but had few concrete results. A five-year term was established for the position of police chief. Token arrests were made in gambling and vice, but the wave soon passed. In January 1936, 60 positions were cut from the department and three precinct stations closed, but the cuts were overturned in the spring elections, which did not go well for the NOOC. In a complicated mayoral election amidst shifting alliances, Langlie lost the general election to former mayor John Dore, whom Smith had bested in 1934.Mayors of the City of Seattle, Seattle City Archives. Accessed online 9 August 2008. Although Dore in his previous term had responded to the onset of the Great Depression by cutting many city jobs and reduced wages, he now promised a reversal of these policies. This and other promises gained him the backing of organized labor in general and Dave Beck of the Teamsters Union in particular. The all-round labor victory also returned David Levine to the city council. Dore announced, \\"This election means the end of fascist, semi- military organizations and of dictatorship in Seattle.\\" Conversely, it brought to power a labor-based political machine. Lockwood lost his council seat in the 1937 elections. Langlie, meanwhile, set his sights again on the mayoralty. Amidst a city fiscal crisis and a complete lack of aid from the state government of Governor Clarence D. Martin, The chaotic election of 1938 saw Langlie faced off against an ailing Dore (who spent most of the campaign period in the hospital, with his son John, Jr. acting as campaign spokesman) and the flamboyant Vic Meyers, a locally famous jazz musician and bandleader who had backed into politics as a joke candidate in 1932, but who after becoming increasingly serious about the matter had become lieutenant governor.Nard Jones (1972), Seattle, Garden City, New York: Doubleday. . p. 215‚Äì217. Meyers, allied with the industrial unionists, including the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), opposed Dore from the left, Langlie from the right. Initially the main thrust of his campaign was an attack on the Dore/Beck alliance, which he accused of amounting to \\"racketeering\\". This \\"'racket' talk\\" did not go over well with the Argus or the city's business community, who were in general happy with the collaborationist truce that had suspended Seattle's long labor war, and who also saw this rhetoric as bad for the city's image in the eyes of the rest of the country. Courting their support, Langlie toned down this rhetoric and re-focused on NOOC's tax-cutting agenda and the city's agenda. Meanwhile, he plotted with the Municipal League against Meyers: their intent was to disqualify Meyers by showing that he had not paid Seattle city taxes during his stint in Olympia (the state capital), but to hold back this attack until such time as it would be too late for another candidate of the same faction to enter the race. Dore attacked Meyers as well, red-baiting him and the CIO by tying them to the Communist Party (CPUSA). In the primary Langlie won big and Dore lost big: Langlie garnered 51,175 votes, Meyers 27,436, Dore 21,480; an additional candidate, William Norton, took 10,457 votes, leaving Langlie to face Meyers in the general election. A resounding, unsolicited Communist endorsement for Meyers in the general election as the \\"New Deal candidate\\" running against a \\"reactionary\\" entirely backfired against Meyers and even Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and left the CIO and the Washington Commonwealth Federation (WCF) looking like communist fronts. Langlie won 80,149 to 48,563. The gravely ill Dore was relieved of his office by the city council on April 13, 1938 (and died five days later); Langlie began his term early. In the wake of Langlie's election, Governor Martin finally came to the city's financial aid, so Langlie expected to face a lesser fiscal crisis than his predecessor. This was, however, balanced or overbalanced by state Social Security Board administrator Charles F. Ernst cutting the relief rolls by 20%, removing over 12,000 Seattleites (and at least 8,000 elsewhere in King County) during one of the harshest periods of the Depression. In office, Langlie immediately overturned a rule that garbage collectors would be paid the prevailing wage. This was the first of a series of Seattle wage cuts (and strikes), most won by employers including the city government. Over the next year, Langlie continued to fight against the power of labor in general and the Teamsters in particular and also revived the NOOC's fight against police corruption, but had to focus mainly on solving Seattle's financial crisis. Among his successes was the resolution of the longstanding crisis over the city's streetcar system: he obtained a US$10.2 million federal grant to pay off the debts and replace the entire system with a network of buses and trackless trolleybuses.Lorin Peterson & Noah C. Davenport (1950), Living in Seattle, Seattle: Seattle Public Schools, p.146‚Äì147 He had the good fortune that the start of World War II in Europe led to a rise in defense production, from which Seattle benefitted greatly. He also obtained federal funding to build the Ballard Bridge and West Seattle Viaduct and to repair recreational facilities. In short, he succeeded in running his fiscally conservative administration by obtaining funds from the liberal Democratic federal government. By 1939 the NOOC had disbanded and Langlie formally identified as Republican. He easily won re-election as mayor in spring 1940, and, as the Republican candidate, won the state governorship in the November 1940 election. The San Francisco chapter The San Francisco chapter of the NOOC was founded by Pat Brown, later Democratic Governor of California, in 1935. It completely lacked the Seattle chapter's militaristic tendencies, but shared its call for an end to \\"partisan bickering\\". It quickly gained over 500 members and established a headquarters on Market Street. The San Francisco chapter soon launched an effort towards the ousting of incumbent members on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, seeking to root out the corruption of those on the Board. After offering enforcement and assistance to a group of rival candidates, the chapter was successful in deposing four of the bureaucrats on the Board and in placing one of their own candidates (Dewey Meade) on the Board. Its main long-term political effect was to bring Brown to prominence.Ethan Rarick (2005), California Rising: The Life and Times of Pat Brown, University of California Press, , p. 22 et. seq.

Cincinnatus' platform According to Ralph Potts writing in 1955, Cincinnatus' platform was: # To bring about a renaissance in politics and to promote a Spartan-like devotion to honesty, cleanliness, efficiency, and economy in government. # To clean out graft, corruption, and hypocrisy in our public offices. # To modernize state, county, and local government and to eliminate all duplicating phases thereof. # To eliminate waste in governmental machinery and to work for a substantial reduction in the tax burden the average taxpayer is forced to bear.

Prior to 1809, European- American settlers began to arrive in the territory, mostly from the mid- Atlantic and New England states. In 1826, the post office was named Madisonville, in order to avoid confusion with other towns. The first permanent settler was Joseph Ward, a sixty-five-year-old American Revolutionary War veteran from New Jersey. Joseph and his two sons, Usual and Israel, came overland by horseback intending to settle in the new outpost of Columbia. Joseph's wife, Phebia, and other sons and daughters traveled by flatboat down the Ohio River to reunite at Columbia. Seeing the flooding at that location, they decided to go up higher and settled in what was to become Madisonville. Joseph and his sons built the first house, a log cabin, in 1797 along an old Indian trail near what is now Whetsel and Monning Avenue. In 1830, the population of the village was 284.

It is also called Petworth Marble, Bethersden Marble or Laughton Stone in relation to villages where it was quarried, and another alternative name is winklestone. It is referred to as \\"marble\\" as it polishes very well, although it is not a true marble, geologically speaking, as it has not been subject to metamorphism. The matrix is made up of the shells of freshwater gastropods and viviparus winkles, similar to but larger than those making Purbeck Marble. The pale calcified remains of the shells are in a matrix of darker material. West Sussex has a good concentration of thin layers of Sussex Marble; beds typically measure no more than thick. There are often two beds‚Äîthe lower formed of smaller-shelled gastropods than the upper‚Äîwith a layer of calcareous clay between them. Historical use Mickleham church in Surrey is made of Sussex marble The Weald of Kent, near the Sussex border, was the centre of quarrying activity, as the material was most prevalent there. Yeomen who owned their own farms were usually involved. Bethersden village is surrounded by \\"small reed-filled and tree-fringed ponds\\" formed by the filling over time of old marble workings. In the area, the Perpendicular Gothic towers of the parish churches of Biddenden, Headcorn, Smarden and Tenterden, pavements and paths in Staplehurst, and the Dering Arms, an inn next to Pluckley railway station, all use the material. In the early 19th century, Sussex Marble quarried at Petworth rivalled many of the stones which were routinely imported from the continent, in both beauty and quality. A kind of shell marble occurring in the Wealden clay, its quarrying was concentrated on the Egremont estate at Kirdford and there are accounts of industry at nearby Plaistow. It was used in several chimney pieces at Petworth House, and in Edward the Confessor's Chapel in Westminster Abbey the tombs of Edward III and of Richard II and his Queen are both in \\"grey Petworth Marble\\".The Saturday Magazine Supplement, May 1834 p.212 At Canterbury Cathedral the Archbishop's chair is an entire piece of the stone.Useful Knowledge: Or A Familiar Account of the Various Productions of Nature: Animal, Vegetable and Mineral which are chiefly employed for the use of Man (1821) Volume I, William Bingley Embellishment of the nave of Chichester Cathedral is in both Purbeck and Petworth Marbles;Winkles's Architectural and Picturesque Illustrations of the Cathedral Churches of England and Wales Volume II (1851) the latter was used for the pillars of the upper triforium which even then showed \\"some decomposition of the shelly particles\\". Church fittings such as altars, rails, piers and floors have been made from the material, as have memorial tablets and parts of tombs. Sussex churches with Sussex Marble fonts include St George's at Trotton, St Peter's at Ardingly and St Mary's at West Chiltington. The lychgate at St Mary Magdalene's Church, Bolney, given to the church in 1905, stands on a base of Sussex Marble. Present day As the material is not in regular supply, much restoration of earlier Sussex Marble work takes place using Purbeck Marble, which is considered a more stable stone. An example of this practice occurred as early as 1870, when the font at St Margaret's Church in West Hoathly had to be restored but the original Sussex Marble, quarried in Petworth, had run out. The industry and workings are long gone although small new rural development around the Surrey/Sussex border occasionally brings up new seams of the stone. The qualities of the material are being rediscovered through British sculptors like Jon Edgar who, after a gap of nearly 200 years, are having to re-discover the ways of working it, its strengths and weaknesses.

Kipp was an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana, and was instrumental in teaching and preserving the Blackfoot language as the Director of the Piegan Institute.Darrell Kipp: Among the Tribes - Idaho Public Television - Home  Biography  Darrell Kipp was born into the Blackfeet Nation in Browning, Montana, the site of their tribal headquarters. He graduated from Browning High School in 1962. During the Vietnam War era, he served as a Sergeant in B Company, 51st Signal Battalion US Army in Korea, along the Korean DMZ. He attended Eastern Montana College. He later earned two master's degrees, an Ed.M from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1975 and a MFA from Vermont College. After working as a technical writer, in the early 1980s Kipp returned to the Blackfeet reservation to study Piegan, the Blackfoot language. Learning that its practice had declined and many native speakers were elders, he and a small group of friends began to work on language revitalization. They first organized the Piegan Institute, a nonprofit devoted to the restoration and preservation of Native American languages. To develop fluent speakers, they also organized a center for language immersion studies, opening it in 1995 as the privately funded Nizipuhwahsin (or Real Speak) Center. It originally taught students in grades from kindergarten through eighth grade. With the Institute, Kipp ultimately developed two immersion schools for teaching the Blackfoot language: Moccasin Flat School and Cuts Wood School. He served on the Board of the Endangered Language Fund, and \\"inspired and encouraged many tribal communities to follow his lead to begin their own language immersion schools.\\" He served as a board member of Siyeh Development, the economic development organization of the Blackfoot tribe. He also served for seventeen years as appellate judge on the tribal court. In 2004 he joined composer Robert Kapilow to write the libretto for a large-scale choral and orchestra work to mark the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial. The work, entitled Summer Sun, Winter Moon, was jointly commissioned by the Kansas City Symphony, the Saint Louis Symphony, and the Louisiana Symphony, and was based on Kipp's libretto. It premiered in September 2004. A documentary of the event, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts, was made and aired on public television. Kipp wrote the introduction to the second edition of the book Mythology of the Blackfoot Indians (compiled and translated by Clark Wissler and D. C. Duvall), published by Bison Books in 2008.

He was raised in San Juan, the capital city of Puerto Rico where he received his primary and secondary education, graduating from Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola. During the early part of his youth he became interested in studying art and culture, however his family expected him to follow his father's footsteps and study medicine.\\"A Bulldog on the Heels of Lost Nazi Loot\\"; New York Times; November 4, 1997; By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI Feliciano moved to Waltham, Massachusetts, and attended Brandeis University, earning in 1974 his bachelor's degree in History and Art History. Feliciano earned his Masters in the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He then went to Paris and earned a doctorate in literature at the University of Paris while working for the city of Paris cultural affairs bureau. He began his career as a cultural writer for the Paris bureau of the Washington Post. In 1988, Feliciano was working on an article for the Paris bureau of the Los Angeles Times about a stolen Murillo painting that had been bought by the Louvre, when someone mentioned that 20 percent of the looted art during World War II is still missing. During the process of his reporting he realized that no one had ever asked the looted families about the situation. Nazi art looting During the Third Reich, agents acting on behalf of the ruling Nazi Party of Germany organized the spoliation of art of European countries. The Nazis confiscated artworks from prominent Jewish collectors and from dealers whose galleries were taken over. Ordinary people, too, lost their art treasures when they left them behind in their homes, as they fled or were sent to Nazi concentration camps. The plundering occurred from 1933 until the end of World War II, although most of the plundered art was acquired during the war. Many of these items were recovered by the Allies immediately following the war, however many more are still missing. The Lost Museum Informed by the original research of Lynn H. Nicholas, author of the ground-breaking book, The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and World War II, Feliciano did additional research on the issue for his book in 1989, using ‚Äì in addition to Nicholas' work ‚Äì material from German looting inventories, documents that had been declassified and more than 200 interviews with art dealers, art historians and the surviving relatives of the families who were victimized. At first, Feliciano believed that the families involved would be hesitant to cooperate in his investigation, however the five families whose stories would be the core of the book, the Rothschilds, the Rosenbergs, the Bernheim-Jeunes, the David-Weills and the Schlosses trusted him with their records and their memories and other families welcomed him. The French government ministries and museums refused to let Feliciano see their records and kept stalling until he was finally permitted to gain access through information requests lodged by the victims' families. Feliciano also had the help of someone from the Ministry of Culture who secretly provided him with documents sent from the Ministry of Culture to the Ministry of Justice which proved that the French museums mingled looted works with their collections. Feliciano had befriended a 92-year-old art dealer by the name of Alfred Daber who remembered all the wartime gossip in regard to the dealings that went on with the looted art. During his investigations Feliciano went to Washington, D.C. to work in the United States National Archives and discovered that Daber himself had been dealing in looted art. In 1997, Feliciano published his book: The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art. Feliciano tried to publish his book in the United States and was turned down by at least 30 publishers. He then went to a publishing house in France, where it was picked up almost immediately. In his book he traces the art works looted as they passed through the hands of top German officials, unscrupulous art dealers, and unwitting auction houses such as Christie's and Sotheby's.Museum Security He also revealed that the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris was amongst the institutions in France and Switzerland that held works that had been seized from Jewish victims during the war by the Germans (these works are now referred to as Mus√©es Nationaux R√©cup√©ration or MNRs). Feliciano exposed the code utilized by the museum to keep track of the provenance of the works in the collection: \\"R\\" referred for \\"recuperation\\" and the number following it signified the order in which the work arrived at the museum. Feliciano charged the museum's curators with having \\"made no huge effort\\" to find the rightful owners for \\"thousands of unclaimed works\\".\\"The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art\\"; by Hector Feliciano, p. 215; New York: Basic Books, 1997; The book, which was first published in French, has since been translated into several other languages. After the book's successful European publication HarperCollins, a U.S. publishing house that had initially turned it down (amongst 30 others), bought the U.S. publication rights. The book points out also the role of Switzerland, whose legislation is very favourable to dishonest dealers and Russia, which categorically refuses to give back the stolen works of art found in Germany at the end of WW2 to their legitimate owners. Aftermath Albert Gleizes, 1911, Le Chemin, Paysage √† Meudon, Paysage avec personnage (Landscape), oil on canvas, 146.4 x 114.4 cm, identified by Hector Feliciano as one of the many art works looted by the Nazis during WW II The French government had to increase efforts to find original owners (or their heirs) of the nearly 2,000 looted works of arts stolen by Nazi Germany. A Matisse painting titled \\"Oriental Woman Seated on Floor,\\" was identified in the Seattle Art Museum as a piece that belonged to the heirs of Paul Rosenberg by someone who read the book. The Rosenberg family then laid claim to the painting. The \\"Paysage\\" (pictured), a 1911 Cubist landscape by Albert Gleizes at the Pompidou Center was identified by Hector Feliciano as having been looted by the Nazis from the home of collector Alphonse Kann during World War II. It was returned to the heirs of Alphonse Kann.Albert Gleizes painting looted by Nazis Families whose art collections were plundered by the Nazis are reclaiming prized paintings that have been found hanging in museums around the world. Auction houses have also stopped sales of works because their postwar sellers may have been thieves. Neither Switzerland or Russia did anything in favour of the legitimate owners or their heirs. Litigation In 1999, a French court rejected a claim for $1 million in damages brought by the Wildenstein family against Feliciano, who suggested in his book that the French-Jewish family did business with Nazi officials during Germany's wartime occupation of France. In the book Feliciano claims that the powerful dealer and collector did business with Nazi art dealers before the war and for months after France's occupation by Germany in June 1940. He also said that after Wildenstein went into exile in New York in January 1941, he maintained contacts with a former employee, Roger Duquoy, who ran the Paris gallery until 1944. The three-judge lower court stated the following in reaching their decision:New York Times, French Court Rejects Suit By Dealer Linked to Nazis; By ALAN RIDING; Published: June 24, 1999 The family of the Parisian art dealer Paul Rosenberg recovered paintings by Matisse, Monet, L√©ger and Bonnard. In 2001, Feliciano sued the Rosenberg family alleging that Mrs. Rosenberg, the widow of Mr. Rosenberg's son, Alexandre had made an oral contract with him promising that she would compensate him for tracking down paintings that were returned to the family in recent years. Feliciano was asking a 17.5 percent of the estimated $39 million value of the paintings as a finders fee, however Mrs. Rosenberg denied she had an oral contract with Feliciano and said he had not been responsible for recovering the paintings. The case was dismissed by Justice Charles E. Ramos, a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan in February 2003.\\"Judge Dismisses Writer's Suit Over Payments for the Recovery of Paintings Stolen by the Nazis\\", New York Times, By TERRY PRISTIN, Published: March 10, 2003 Later years During the 1998-99 academic year, as part of the National Arts Journalism Program, Feliciano was one of fourteen journalists selected for a Journalism Fellowship by Columbia University, in which he specialized in arts and culture.New York Times - Four Universities Announce Recipients of Journalism Fellowships He continued to live in Paris and was the editor in chief of World Media Network, a newspaper syndicate serving 23 European newspapers. Feliciano worked as the director of the Ministry of Culture and the \\"Club des Po√®tes\\" in Paris before moving to New York City where he writes for El Pais and Clarin. Feliciano is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at New York University, and has served on the Panel of Experts of the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. He is the organizer of the First International Symposium on Cultural Property and Patrimony (Columbia University, 1999) and of a panel discussion entitled \\"The Art of the Enemy\\" (School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2002).

West End is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio, located north-west of downtown, east of Queensgate, west of Over-the-Rhine, and south-east of Fairview. The population was 6,627 at the 2010 census. The historic West End was largely razed in the 1950s as part of a series of urban renewal projects, including the construction of Interstate 75. The West End is the location of City West, the largest housing development project in Cincinnati since World War II. The project transformed the once low-income area into mixed-income development. In 1999 many of the blighted, cramped buildings were leveled to make way for new townhomes with ample parking. In 2007, part 1 crimes were down by 30% when compared to 1999. Controversy erupted in 2005 when plans were announced to open a $15-million \\"one-stop\\" social services facility at 800 Bank Street. The project, known as CityLink, would be the largest such facility in Cincinnati. Some argued that it would increase crime and poverty in the West End, decrease property value, and undermine the redevelopment there. Some even accused the city of trying to relocate the poor from the thriving Over-the-Rhine neighborhood to the West End. However, proponents argued that the West End's central location makes it easy for the poor to access. A lawsuit to stop the CityLink project failed, as did the subsequent appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. CityLink Center has since launched in 2013, serving over 3,000 Cincinnati residents since that time including over 250 from the West End neighborhood. Individuals engage in the center to advance their lives holistically through the integrated support of over 14 on-site agencies. The development of CityLink Center has not resulted in crime, development has actually further continued, and property values have increased. The West End is served by a branch of the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. In 2021, FC Cincinnati of Major League Soccer will build a new soccer stadium in the neighborhood, at the site of Stargel Stadium on Central Parkway.

Wildflowers include such species as the footsteps of spring, blue-eyed grass, checkerbloom, shooting star and yellow mariposa lily. Geology Bernal Hill, along with the other hills in the San Francisco area, is a folded hill, created by the \\"wrinkling up\\" effect of the Pacific plate subducting under the North American plate, when the North American and Pacific plates were converging, around 150 million years ago. Near the summit are folded layers of very hard rock called radiolarian chert. It is a sedimentary silicate rock which gets its silica content from the shells of microscopic creatures called radiolaria. The red color comes from iron oxide. In between the layers of chert are thinner layers of shale in many different colors from the same red as the surrounding rock to white, green and purple.

The neighborhood is redeveloping, restoring many of its buildings and introducing new businesses to the area. The population was 6,495 at the 2010 census. History The neighborhood was named from the farm of an early settler, Reverend James Kemper, which he called Walnut Hill. For generations, the Kemper family lived in the Kemper Log House. Walnut Hills was annexed to the City of Cincinnati in September, 1869. After the turn of the century, new migrants from Cincinnati‚Äôs downtown basin moved to the area. Like South Avondale, Walnut Hills was home to many Jewish and Italian families. An area on the western side of McMillan St. was known as ‚ÄúLittle Italy.‚Äù After construction of the Union Terminal, and other public housing projects demolished housing in the West End, many African Americans moved to the area in the 1930s. When modern suburbs were created after World War II, many of community's middle class white residents moved out of Walnut Hills. Similarly, middle class African Americans moved from the area after less affluent residents moved to the area. Almost 80% of Walnut Hills was populated by African Americans by 1970. Architecture and historic landmarks In addition to Walnut Hill‚Äôs Victorian homes, it has many architectural treasures and historical sites.

He won the bronze medal at the 1975 Pan American Games in Mexico City in the men's lightweight division at 70 kg. Burris is a five time US national senior AAU champion, including an unprecedented four straight championships. He was named 1976 US national Grand Champion (best in all weight classes) ‚Äì the lightest Grand Champion ever. Burris was a standout in both wrestling and judo as a youth at Rancho Alamitos High School in Garden Grove, California, where he won a bronze medal in the Southern California Interscholastic Federation Wrestling finals. He demonstrated his potential in judo when he won his first national championship as a sophomore. He went on to attend Santa Ana Junior College where, in the 1969‚Äì1970 wrestling season, he compiled a 36‚Äì1 record before winning the California State Junior College championship at 150 lbs. In judo, he won the 1968 National Junior judo championship at 150 lbs and the Southern Pacific AAU championship at 139 lbs and 150 lbs in 1968 and 1969. He placed third in the US Men's National Tournament in 1969. Burris transferred to the University of Northern Colorado (UNC) in Greeley where he became a two-time Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference champion wrestling for the Bears at 150 lbs in 1971 and 1972. He graduated from UNC with a bachelor's degree in Education in 1972. In April 1972, less than two months after participating in the NCAA College Division wrestling tournament in Oswego, New York, Burris won the US National Senior Men's Judo championship in Philadelphia by throwing a previous US national champion, Paul Maruyama, something that had never been done. This earned him the right to represent the United States Olympic judo team that year. Shortly after the 1976 Summer Olympics, Burris returned to northern Colorado and began his coaching career at Fort Lupton High School when he was named Head Wrestling Coach in late August. After moving to Oklahoma in 1985, he coached Ron Tripp to a 1994 world heavyweight championship in sambo.

It did not have a connection to the other common carrier railway on the island, the Ahukini Terminal and Railway, although both were built to the same track gauge. Almost all railway trackage on Kauai was connected together due to an agreement with the U.S. Government to interconnect the common carriers and sugarcane plantation railways. The government imposed this as a condition before they would agree to improve the port of Nawiliwili for oceangoing ships. The line was opened 1907. In 1936 the company name was changed to the Kauai Terminal Company. The last train ran 1947, with rail operations replaced by trucks.

Houses on River Road in Sedamsville Sedamsville is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio. The population was 680 at the 2010 census. History Sedamsville was established in 1795 by Colonel Cornelius Sedam, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, who moved to the area to assist in the building of Fort Washington. A town of mostly German immigrants, Sedamsville was once one of the most recognized wine producing territories in the country. The Industrial Revolution changed the landscape bringing commerce and large factories to the area along with a new influx of residents. Unfortunately the Great Depression saw many of those businesses close their doors, and then the disastrous flood of 1937 made it impossible for many to rebuild. Many more buildings were destroyed with the widening of River Road in the 1940s which nearly wiped out the business district completely. 91 buildings were razed and 100 families displaced. With the closing of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church, the neighborhood began to deteriorate. With help from the Cincinnati Preservation Association, many historic buildings have been saved from demolition. Nearly the whole town is now listed on the National Registry of Historical places. Although Sedamsville is far from the prosperous manufacturing hub it once was, it is still home to many prominent small and large businesses. Sedamsville is surrounded by many resources. The town is located on one of the busiest waterways in the country, the Ohio River. The extensive CSX railway is nearby. The scenic by-way of route US 50 is the main thoroughfare. Sedamsville is on the Metro bus line. There are many parks to enjoy including Embschoff, Mt. Echo, and Boldface Park (named after Chief Boldface of the Native Americans who were the first residents).

He chaired the meetings that produced the radical Mecklenburg Resolves and, allegedly, the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence.  Early life  Alexander was born in Cecil County, Maryland, December 9, 1717. He migrated to the frontier of the province of North Carolina with many other Scots-Irish colonists, and became a leader in the Scots-Irish community. He was one of the Presbyterian leaders who obtained a charter for Queen's College (subsequently known as Queen's Museum), which was a forerunner of Queens University of Charlotte. The college was permanently closed in 1780 during the American Revolutionary War, when British troops invaded the area. When Mecklenburg County was created in 1762, Alexander was appointed as one of the county's first justices of the peace. That same year he became an officer in the local militia. In 1768 he was among the trustees who founded the town of Charlotte, and the following year he was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly. Before the American Revolution, the Scots-Irish of North Carolina were generally supportive of the British royal governors of the province, which often put them at odds with other colonists. In 1765, Alexander was beaten by squatters while he was attempting to survey land for royal officials. In 1771, Alexander and his militiamen responded to Governor Tryon's call for support in putting down the Regulators, but the Mecklenburg men arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Alamance.  American Revolution and after  This support for the royal governors ended in the early stages of the American Revolution. After Governor Josiah Martin dissolved the North Carolina Assembly in 1774, Alexander was elected to the first North Carolina Provincial Congress. In May 1775, Alexander was chosen by his militia company to be a delegate at a meeting held in Charlotte where measures were to be discussed regarding the ongoing dispute between the British Empire and the American colonies. Alexander, who was chairman of the Mecklenburg Committee of Safety, was elected to serve as the meeting's chairman. According to testimony first published many years after the event, the delegates adopted and signed the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence on May 20. If the story is true, the Mecklenburg Declaration preceded the United States Declaration of Independence by more than a year, but the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration is discounted by most modern historians. The meeting also produced (on May 31) the radical Mecklenburg Resolves, the authenticity of which is not questioned, which effectively ended British authority in Mecklenburg County. Whether Alexander helped draft either of these documents is not known. Based on the traditions surrounding the Mecklenburg Declaration, older histories of North Carolina in the American Revolution portrayed Alexander as a major figure in the local revolutionary movement. According to Converse Clowse, modern academic historians find little documentary evidence to support this traditional view. Alexander's public service clearly indicates that he was trusted by the community, but the degree to which he made major decisions and helped shape public opinion cannot be determined from the surviving contemporary evidence. Alexander was known to have served in the Mecklenburg County Regiment in 1780 as a Private, then a Sergeant under Capt. Samuel Givens, then, back to Private. He fought at the Battle of Camden in South Carolina on Aug 16, 1780. Alexander died in Mecklenburg County. He is buried with his wife Dorcas in the graveyard at the Sugar Creek Presbyterian Church.

Cumminsville was incorporated in 1865 and annexed into Cincinnati eight years later. In the early 1900s, growth attracted many German Catholics. Cumminsville also attracted a number of African-Americans, who moved to the area of Follett and Dreman avenues. This sub-neighborhood became known as South Cumminsville, according to history books. Boosted by the opening of the Millvale apartments in the 1950s, South Cumminsville evolved into a predominantly African-American community. Many of the newcomers in the northern portions of Cumminsville became to identify themselves with Northside, while South Cumminsville retained its identity. One of the more grisly aspects of Cumminsville history stems from a rash of unsolved murders that occurred there in the early 1900s. From 1904-1910, five women were savagely slain within a mile of the Spring Grove and Winton Road corner in Cumminsville, earning the district the grisly sobriquet of \\"the murder zone\\" and sparking fear that Cincinnati was in the grip of its first serial killer.

South Fairmount is a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio. It contains one of the highest concentrations of Section 8 housing in Hamilton County. The population was 2,368 at the 2010 census. South Fairmount lies just south of the North Fairmount neighborhood. History Fairmount began as a sprinkling of farm homes in the early 1800s. Later as the Mill Creek valley became industrialized, the creek bed was spanned and factories were located at the base of the hill. A brewery was established as early as 1825, and several more beer makers arrived in the next decades. The first newcomers were a few French and German immigrants. The community attracted Italians near the turn of the century. Fairmount developed distinct neighborhoods, I.e. North Fairmount, South Fairmount, Millvale (in northeast Fairmount), and English Woods (an early federal housing project). Lick Run Watershed improvements The Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati (MSD) is in the design stage of a stream daylighting project to restore the Lick Run which used to flow between Queen City Avenue and Westwood Avenue. MSD is required to remove 85% of the annual 14 billion gallons of the combined sewer overflows (CSOs) that occur each year in the outdated sewer system during rain events. The largest contributor to the overflows is CSO 5 in the Lick Run Watershed which dumps 1.7 billion gallons of raw sewage into the Mill Creek annually. By separating the storm water from the sanitary sewage most of the rain water can be sent straight into a creek, thus alleviating the watershed from CSOs. Two plans have been proposed by MSD to solve the issue. The preferred plan is to daylight the stream, allowing the rain water to collect in the restored Lick Run and discharge into the Mill Creek. This option is anticipated to cost approximately $195 million. Some community opposition has been raised for this alternative with a few residents likening it to an \\"open drainage ditch\\" and concern about the existing businesses and building stock between the two thoroughfares. The alternative \\"grey\\" solution would consist of constructing a new 25-foot diameter tunnel to replace the 19.5-foot tunnel currently in place. This alternative would not separate the storm water from the sanitary sewage so MSD would still be responsible for treating the storm water as if it is sewage. This alternative is expected to cost about $312 million.http://projectgroundwork.org/downloads/lowermillcreek/LMCPR_Report_Summary.pdf  References  Neighborhoods in Cincinnati ","title":"South Fairmount, Cincinnati"},{"id":"18781064","text":"Palmetto Middle School may refer to: * Palmetto Middle School in Pinecrest, Florida * Palmetto Middle School in Mullins, South Carolina * Palmetto Middle School in Williamston, South Carolina ","title":"Palmetto Middle School"},{"id":"18781074","title":"List of diplomatic missions in Vietnam"},{"id":"18781079","text":"Heebo may be: *an old spelling of Igbo *the name of a variant of the Roboto typeface  See also  * Hebo (disambiguation) ","title":"Heebo"},{"id":"18781085","text":"Roberto Zablith Machusso (born January 4, 1954) is a retired competitive judoka from Brazil, who represented his native country at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montr√©al, Canada.

A. (1988). Economic transformation of Negros Oriental. Philippine Studies, 36(1), 68‚Äì74.http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1812886 History Precolonial period Negros was originally known as Buglas, an old Visayan word meaning \\"cut off\\". The original natives of the island are the dark-skinned Ati Negritos, from where the island would later derive its name after an expedition of Castilian conquistadors in April 1565 came in contact with the Ati in what is now the town of Ilog. Southern Negros‚Äîin particular, Candoni‚Äîcame to be settled by precolonial migrants from the island of Panay. These came to be known as the Negrense highlanders (Hiligaynon and Cebuano: bukidnong Buglasnon or Magahat). A second wave of migrants from Panay came to inhabit the northwestern portion of the island; they are known today as the Panayan highlanders (Hiligaynon and Cebuano: bukidnong Panaynon or Suludnon), who continue to reside on Panay as well as on Negros. The Madyaas Confederation would later exert nominal control over the villages and sakups of the Panayan highlanders. Spanish colonial era After the island was discovered by Castilian colonizers in April 1565, it was only in 1573 and 1583 that the island was settled permanently, centered around Binalbagan and the designated capital, Ilog in the present-day Negros Occidental, and Dumaguete in the present-day Negros Oriental. Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi placed Negros under the jurisdiction of the governor of Oton on Panay. In 1734, however, the island became a military district with Ilog as its first capital. The seat of government was later transferred to Himamaylan until Bac√≥lod became the capital in 1849, heralding the opening of the sugar industry spearheaded by British diplomat and businessman Nicholas Loney.https://www.jstor.org/stable/43486357 Through the missionary efforts of the Recollects, additional settlements in Hinigaran, Bago, Marayo (now Pontevedra), Mamalan (now Himamaylan) and San Enrique. =Sugar boom= The mass settlement of Negros, beginning in the 1850s and greatly encouraged by Loney,Gonzaga, V. L. (1988). The roots of agrarian unrest on Negros, 1850‚Äì90. Philippine Studies, 36(2), 151‚Äì165. was triggered by the surge in the demand for sugar back in Europe.https://archive.org/details/sweetnesspowerpl00mint European demand and Philippine supply would place Negros squarely on the British-dominated global economic map for the next hundred years. The mass settlement was pioneered by Ilo√≠lo-based landowners, though the mountainous terrain of the island made it more practical for colonists to settle the coastal areas on opposite ends. As a result, the western half came to be settled by Hiligaynon-speaking migrants, while the eastern half was settled by Cebuano-speaking migrants, with subsequent settlers from other parts of the Philippines assimilating into either linguistic sphere. Administration became difficult as the trip between the eastern portions to Himamaylan (the second capital) and later on, Bac√≥lod in 1849, required a 3‚Äì5-day trek through the mountains. Thirteen Recollect friars assigned to the eastern side appealed to the Governor-General to divide the island, with their side assigned to the civil government in Ceb√∫. Finally, on January 1, 1890, Governor-General Valeriano Weyler issued a decree, partitioning Negros into Negros Occidental, with Bac√≥lod retained as its designated capital, and Negros Oriental, with Dumaguete as the designated capital. The division was not made along linguistic lines but rather for practical administrative purposes: those falling under the jurisdiction of the 13 friars composed the new Negros Oriental province, which also includes the Hiligaynon-speaking towns of Tolong (present-day Santa Catalina) and Tolong Nuevo (present-day Bayawan City). The Cebuano-speaking towns of Sagay, Escalante, San Carlos (all three later converted into cities) and Calatrava chose to remain with Negros Occidental. Emigration In the aftermath of World War II, there began a steady rise of migration to Mindanao. Many Negrenses, who would otherwise inherit only a small portion of family land on Negros, availed of resettlement benefits from the government instead. This diaspora on Mindanao would in turn spur the creation of the sugar industries in the highland areas of Northern Mindanao and SOCCSKSARGEN. Families such as the Montillas and Zubiris of southern Negros would also rise to political prominence in their adopted provinces of Sultan Kudarat and Bukidnon, respectively. Mindanao localities that are home to the highest concentrations of diaspora Negrenses are the Valencia, Tacurong, Koronadal and General Santos, while significant numbers reside in D√°vao, Zamboanga and Cagay√°n de Oro as well. With the declaration of Martial Law by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972 and the collapse of the sugar industry on Negros in the 1980s due to the expiration a few years earlier of the Laurel‚ÄìLangley Agreement, which had previously guaranteed Philippine sugar-producers access to the US market, Negrense families immigrated en masse from Negros to the United States, Canada and Australia to escape the economic losses incurred with the steep decline of the island's main crop. Large diaspora populations have since formed in the United States (Hawaii, California, New Jersey and New York) and in Australia (Queensland and New South Wales). Sizable diasporas have also emerged in Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom, where they work and live as either overseas workers or permanent expatriates. The collapse of the Negros sugar industry and the \\"widespread hunger, unemployment, and terrorism\\" that subsequently engulfed the island accounts for the large Negrense presence outside the homeland,Billig, M. S. (1994). The death and rebirth of entrepreneurism on Negros island, Philippines: A critique of cultural theories of enterprise. Journal of Economic Issues, 28(3), 659‚Äì678. whether in other parts of the country or abroad. All strata of Negrense society took part in the emigration from the island: from the long- impoverished sacadas to the managerial hacenderos and the landowning hacendados, the latter two now easily stripped by Marcos of their kingmaker roles in national politics. During this time, the troubles on Negros‚Äîincluding the infamous Escalante massacre‚Äîmade the island \\"briefly famous in the international media\\" as a \\"social volcano\\".

Culture Language Migration into and within Negros, especially during the fortune-seeking decades of the late-Spanish and US-colonial eras, has created a distinct blend of people, culture and languages, with the northwestern half, comprising Negros Occidental, having a Hiligaynon-speaking majority,The Bacolod Metropolitan Area is noted for its distinct dialect of Hiligaynon called Bakolodnon. while the southeastern half, comprising Negros Oriental, having a Cebuano-speaking majority. Descendants of the indigenous Magahat and Ati peoples speak the Magahat language, which is highly influenced by Hiligaynon and Karay¬∑a as a result of their interactions and intermarriage with colonial- era migrants from Ilo√≠lo and Antique; while those descended from the Panayan highlanders speak Sulod. The Carolan language continues to be spoken in Kabankalan by descendants of the indigenous Carolans. The Cebuano language predominates in Siquijor. Religion The majority of Negrenses are Christians; for the most part Catholics with a number of Orthodox and Protestant faithful.

The story introduced the taciturn hero Rocket Llama and his talkative sidekick, an anthropomorphic cat named Bartholemew 'Bart' Meowsenhausen, who find themselves stranded on an island after a battle with an enemy called Jetpack Dog. Spherical islanders capture them and then challenge them to combat. A villain named B√∂wser v√∂n √úberdog arrives with Jetpack Dog and, in a sudden Star Wars parody, summons a giant robot known as the Super Robot Dog Walker which blasts a volcano to bits. Before it can fire a second blast, Rocket Llama destroys it by getting it to swallow a pot of water and backfire.

Above street- level retailers are condominiums, offices and a fine arts movie theater served by underground parking, grade level parking and street parking. The development has been featured in the 2005 Urban Land Institute Handbook on Mixed Use Development; the 2003 Urban Land Institute Handbook on Town Center Development; and the 2002 Urban Land Institute Handbook on Place Making: Developing Town Centers, Main Streets and Urban Villages. The facility was master planned and designed by the international architectural firm of Suttle Mindlin and has been a major factor in the revitalization of downtown Highland Park.

Life and career  Heinrich Biltz was the son of Karl Friedrich Biltz who was a literary scholar and theatre critic His brother Wilhelm Biltz was also a noted chemist. After his university entrance diploma at the Royal Grammar School (K√∂nigliches Wilhelm-Gymnasium) in Berlin in 1885 Heinrich began studying chemistry in the Humboldt University of Berlin with August Wilhelm von Hofmann. later studying at the University of G√∂ttingen with Victor Meyer. In 1888 he was awarded his doctorate in natural science with the continuation of research commenced by Victor Meyer on the molecular weight of substances at high temperatures. During this time he also determined the vapour density from Tin (II) chloride and Sulphur.\\"Experimentelle Einf√ºhrung in die Anorganische Chemie\\"; (Klemm/Fischer), Walter de Gruyter; Berlin, 20. Auflg. 1985; From 8 July 1891 to 1897 Heinrich was a professor of chemistry at the University of Greifswald. In 1897 he became a professor of the Department of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Kiel where he continued his research on the determination of vapour density. In 1908 he succeeded in the synthesis of Phenytoin, which was used 30 years later as an effective drug for the control of seizure disorders. From autumn 1911 until his retirement in 1933 Heinrich lectured at the newly formed Albert Ladenburg Institute of the University of Breslau (Wroclaw) with his main emphasis on chemical reactions of organic substances, especially the reactions of Acetylene and Autoxidation.\\"Ausf√ºhrung quantitativer Analysen\\"; 10.

He achieved and proved the complete oxidative degradation of Uric Acid with several oxidising agents.\\"Die neue Harns√§urechemie,Tatsachen und Erkl√§rungen\\"; J. A. Barth, Leipzig, 1936; Heinrich's work was interrupted when he participated in World War I as a reserve officer. After the war he increased his research activities considerably, often in close co-operation with his younger brother Wilhelm Biltz who was also professor of chemistry and with other highly renowned chemists. The German Chemical Industry established in 1925 the Heinrich-Biltz-Foundation which was destined to support highly skilled students. In honour of the merits of Heinrich Biltz, Walter H√ºckel issued an obituary in the journal Chemische Berichte and annexed a complete bibliography of his work.

The game was released on November 4, 2009 exclusively on Microsoft Windows via Steam.  Gameplay  Shattered Horizon is a first-person shooter where players fight in zero gravity surrounded by the broken remains of Earth's orbital infrastructure and billions of tons of rocky debris thrown into orbit by a huge explosion on the Moon. In Shattered Horizon, players have complete freedom of movement. They can make full use of the space setting and zero gravity to set up tactics and strategies that would be impossible in games constrained by gravity.  Maps  There are currently eight maps provided with Shattered Horizon, four from after the game's release with the Moonrise content pack. These maps are diverse, ranging from the damaged ISS (ISS), to a mining station on an asteroid (Moondust), to a two-faced asteroid harboring an abandoned research station (Flipside), to a sector of the Arc (The Arc). Each map is playable in either the assault, battle, or skirmish mode. The game's designer states that without gravity players will experience gameplay that is both familiar to fans of the FPS style and yet different from any game they have played before.  Plot  Shattered Horizon is set in 2049. Man is back on the Moon and the companies that took him there are reaping huge profits. Their greed soon leads to the largest mining accident in history. A catastrophic explosion throws billions of tons of rocky debris into near-Earth space, its aftershocks threatening to tear apart the Moon itself. Fragments of the Moon settle around the Earth and become known as the Arc, named after the dramatic shape they draw across the night sky. With Earth surrounded by debris, there is little chance of rescue or return for the thousands of people stranded in space. The International Space Agency's (ISA) astronauts and scientists trapped in the battered International Space Station are given the task of apprehending those responsible for the catastrophe. Weapons are among the last supplies sent to the station before the supply route from Earth is cut. The Moon Mining Cooperative (MMC) finds itself facing serious charges after only barely surviving the cataclysm. Cut off from Earth, they see the ISA as a threat to their very existence. The two sides are drawn into an armed conflict. Desperate battles are fought over strategic locations and the scant supplies from Earth that make it through the shroud of debris. Control of the Arc now means the difference between survival and death in the cold of space.  Development and release  Shattered Horizon is Futuremark Games Studio's first title. The studio was founded in January 2008 by a company known for its PC benchmarking tools 3DMark and PCMark. The development is self-funded. The developers of Shattered Horizon have stated in interviews that their goal was to \\"make something that hasn't really been done\\" and that entering into game development was discussed within the company for long before it was publicly announced. The game was first shown to press at Games Convention 2008 in Leipzig. GameSpot's first look preview notes that the game has \\"a really great premise\\" and that the gameplay \\"promises to benefit\\" from said premise. A more advanced build was shown to press at Gamescom 2009, where GameSpot found that \\"Shattered Horizon is an intriguing online shooter that seems poised to grab attention\\" and that \\"the controls in Shattered Horizon are remarkably easy to grasp\\". Eurogamer's hands-on preview from the game's closed beta test reported that \\"Shattered Horizon is intuitively playable and immediately comprehensible\\". The preview notes an attention to detail and the developer's intent to make the setting true to real space, and concludes that \\"assuming Futuremark can sustain its developmental momentum, this will be one shooter that should be able to reach a stable orbit around the homeworld of gaming interest.\\" Play Magazine published a detailed preview of the game that praised the game's graphics and ambitious game design: \\"the lofty goal of representing FPS combat in realistic zero gravity environments has been achieved\\". The preview made special mention of the game's setting and back story, concluding with a challenge to the developer, \\"Let‚Äôs build a franchise\\". In March 2011, the Last Stand pack was made available as downloadable content. This expansion adds in single player and online co-op, as well as a new game mode. In August 2014, the game was removed from the Steam store, due to a lack of time from Futuremark, two years after the company was bought by Rovio Entertainment, however, you can still use keys bought from resellers to download and play the game from Steam.  Reception  At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from selected critics, Shattered Horizon has received a score of 72/100 which indicates \\"mixed or average reviews\\". GameSpot rated Shattered Horizon 7.5/10, praising the handling of zero-gravity movement, atmospheric environments and the unique and deep combat mechanics, but citing the system requirements (particularly the requirement of DirectX 10) and the lack of single player game modes, levels and tutorial or bot support as its major setbacks. Post-launch, developer Futuremark Games Studio addressed some of the common criticisms by releasing several free updates to the game. The Moonrise map pack released February 16, 2010 added four new levels, the Firepower weapons pack released May 5, 2010 introduced new weapons and grenades and the Last Stand pack released March 17, 2011 introduced single player options with bots and a new game mode.

Before the Meiji Restoration, his courtesy title was Bizen no Kami. He became a politician in the Meiji era, and served as the first governor of Okinawa Prefecture.  Biography  Born in the Kashima Domain in Hizen Province, Naoyoshi was the 3rd son of the 10th daimy≈ç of Kashima, . In 1848, the 13th daimy≈ç of Kashima, , went into forced retirement under strong pressure from Nabeshima Naomasa due to fiscal mismanagement, and the title went to Naoyoshi. During the early part of his administration, Kashima's financial affairs were so dire that they came to be entirely handled by the main Saga Domain, and in 1851 Naoyoshi even proposed that the domain be abolished and absorbed into Saga. He was opposed by the other branches of the Nabeshima clan (i.e. Hasunoike Domain and Ogi Domain. In 1853, Kashima Domain had a further financial burden imposed when the Tokugawa shogunate assigned it responsibility for security during the visit of Russian diplomat Yevfimy Putyatin to Nagasaki as part of Russia‚Äôs efforts to end Japan's national isolation policy and to establish commercial and diplomatic relations. From 1860, Naoyoshi began secret discussions with representatives of the Imperial court and became a supporter of the movement to overthrow the Tokugawa regime. In 1866 he protected Soejima Taneomi, who was being hunted by the Shogunate. In 1868, with the start of the Boshin War, he pledged Kashima domain in support of the Satch≈ç Alliance and Emperor Meiji. In June 1869, the title of daimy≈ç was abolished, and Naoyoshi was appointed domain governor. However, in 1871, Kashima Domain itself was abolished with the abolition of the han system, and became part of the new Saga Prefecture. Naoyoshi subsequently relocated to Tokyo. From August 1872 to 1876, Naoyoshi traveled to the United States. On his return, he served as an advisor to Emperor Meiji, and traveled in the retinue of the Emperor to Kyoto in 1877, during the Satsuma Rebellion. From 1878, he was appointed an official tutor to the Emperor under the Imperial Household Ministry. Following the 1879 abolition of the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom and its annexation by Japan as Okinawa Prefecture, Naoyoshi was appointed the prefecture's first governor, arriving there aboard the Tokai-maru on May 18, 1879.Kerr, George H. Okinawa: The History of an Island People. (revised ed.) Tokyo: Tuttle Publishing, 2003. p383. Under his administration, the national public education system began to be implemented in Okinawa, with a particular focus on teaching the standard Japanese language, which very few in the islands could speak at that time. Many schools were established during the period of Naoyoshi's administration, and the prefecture's economic production was increased, particularly in the area of sugar production. In 1881, Naoyoshi was recalled to Tokyo, and became president of the Genr≈çin. With the establishment of the kazoku peerage, he became a , and a member of the House of Peers on the establishment of the Diet of Japan in 1890. In his later years he helped build hospitals and schools in the region of Kashima, which he had once ruled, and was awarded Second Court rank shortly before his death in 1915.

He notes that the chronology of Sultan Mahmud's reign is very uncertain; the first year of his reign could have been as early as 1485 and as late as 1500, while the end of his reign could have been between 1537 and 1542. Biography Sultan Mahmud was the son of Nizam al-Din Yahya and the sister of the Timurid Sultan Abu Sa'id.Bosworth, p. 460 Nizam al-Din Yahya had died in 1480, having lost most of Sistan to the Timurids; his territories were restricted to the mountainous region bordering Baluchistan. The inheritance fell to Sultan Mahmud's half-brother Shams al-Din Muhammad, but the latter quickly proved himself incapable of ruling; as a result Sultan Mahmud ended up assuming effective control of the government. He planned to recapture Sistan and marched on the capital Shahr-i Sistan, but was defeated by the Timurid army and nearly drowned while crossing the Helmand River.Bosworth, pp. 464-5 A change in the Timurid leadership of Sistan, combined with local appeals for the Mihrabanids to return, prompted Sultan Mahmud and Shams al-Din Muhammad to try again to reconquer the province. This time they were successful, and the brothers moved into Shahr-i Sistan. The joint administration did not last for long, however, as the local lords and military commanders grew increasingly dissatisfied with Shams al-Din Muhammad. Eventually the latter was deposed and Sultan Mahmud was formally made malik.Bosworth, pp. 465-6 Relations with the Uzbeks and Safavids In 1507 the Shaybanid Uzbek Muhammad Shaybani put an end to Timurid rule in Khursasan and occupied Herat. Muhammad Shaybani then sent an army under the command of his nephew Shah Mansur Bakhshi to take over Sistan. Sultan Mahmud, following the advice of his advisers, abandoned the capital and made his way to the borderlands near Makran, where it would be difficult for the Uzbeks to engage them. He spent the next two years there waiting for an opportunity to strike against the Uzbeks.Bosworth, pp. 467-8 By the autumn of 1510 Sultan Mahmud judged it wise to mount an offensive; crossing the Helmand, his army was able to surprise and defeat the Uzbeks and their local allies. Shah Mansur Bakhshi was killed and the Mihrabanids were able to reoccupy Shahr-i Sistan. At approximately the same time, the Safavids had invaded Khursasan and defeated Muhammad Shaybani and his army. Sultan Mahmud decided to make his submission to the Safavid shah Isma'il and set out for Herat, where the shah was residing. He became a vassal of Isma'il, after which he was eventually allowed to return to Sistan.Bosworth, pp. 468-9 As a Safavid vassal, Sultan Mahmud was required to initiate the use of the Shi'a rites in Sistan, a move that was deeply unpopular in the traditionally Sunni province.Bosworth, pp. 475-6 He also had to accept the presence of a Qizilbash army in Sistan, and of a wakil, or representative of the shah, named Mir Pir Quli. The wakil remained in Sistan for ten years. During this time Sultan Mahmud moved out of Shahr-i Sistan and set himself up in the fortress of Taraqun.Bosworth, pp. 469-70 A program to repair several other fortresses in the province was also begun. Last Years Local discontent with the Qizilbash and Mir Pir Quli prompted Sultan Mahmud to bribe them to abandon Sistan for the border regions; as a result Safavid influence over Sistan was temporarily lessened. By this time, however, the malik had become tired of ruling. He attempted to transfer power to his son-in-law Malik Yahya but this move failed, and the deaths of several Mihrabanid family members left him without anyone to succeed him. Eventually he gave over effective control of the government to a man of unknown connection with the Mihrabanid family, Amir Muhammad-i Mahmud, and gave himself up to a life of pleasure in Taraqun. These events contributed to a weakening of the central government: robbers became a problem and at least one local official revolted against Mihrabanid rule.Bosworth, pp. 471-2 By c. 1537 the Safavid shah Tahmasp decided to gain fuller control over Sistan. He sent a wakil to the province and gave him direct control over four districts. Sultan Mahmud disliked these changes and abandoned Sistan for India, where he was received by the Mughal Emperor Humayun and given the governorship of Lahore for five years. At the end of this time he returned to Iran and spent a year at the court of the Safavid Shah in Qazvin, where he died in around 1543. Although there were members of the Mihrabanid family that survived him, Sistan was henceforth controlled by Safavid wakils.Bosworth, pp. 474-5 Notes References *Bosworth, C.E.

History The site of Lincolnwood Town Center was formerly occupied by the headquarters of Bell & Howell. Developers Melvin Simon & Associates (now known as Simon Property Group and Chicago-based Hawthorn Realty first proposed to build a mall on the site in 1985, but the plan was turned down by city trustees. A second plan, calling for a smaller shopping mall and offices, was approved in 1987. Upon opening in 1990, the mall featured two anchor stores, both of which were Chicago-based department stores: Madigan's and Carson Pirie Scott (later known as Carson's), with space for up to 90 mall shops within of total shop space. Representatives of Melvin Simon & Associates noted that the mall's development was indicative of a trend toward building malls within urban settings as opposed to suburbs. Madigan's closed in 1991 after only a year in business, and was replaced that same year by J. C. Penney. This store was closed in 2001, and in 2002, it was converted to Kohl's. In 2018, the Carson's store was shuttered following the bankruptcy of parent company The Bon-Ton. Following this announcement, an article published by RE Journal analyzed several Chicago-area malls which were all about to lose a Carson's store, and noted that Lincolnwood Town Center posed a risk of tenancy loss given its smaller size compared to other area malls.

Life and career  Wilhelm Biltz was the son of Karl Friedrich Biltz who was a literary scholar and theatre critic. His brother Heinrich Biltz also became a noted chemist.  Education After his university entrance diploma at the Royal Grammar School (K√∂nigliches Wilhelm-Gymnasium) in Berlin in 1895 and influenced by his elder brother Heinrich, Wilhelm Biltz began studying chemistry in the Humboldt University of Berlin, the University of Heidelberg and continued his studies in 1898 with professor Friedrich Wilhelm Semmler in the University of Greifswald where he was awarded his doctorate in natural science with research on the chemistry of Terpenes. Academic career From 1900 Wilhelm Biltz worked as an assistant and from 1903 as an associate professor with Otto Wallach at the University of G√∂ttingen. There he concentrated his work firstly on the determination of vapour density in solutions of inorganic compounds and later he was engaged in researches into the chemistry of colloids.Parachor und Nullpunktvolumen, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Berlin, 1935 He gained further scientific and practical experiences in the university research institute of Clemens Winkler in analytical and inorganic chemistry and later in Metallurgy in G√∂ttingen with Gustav Tamman. During these years he also investigated the influence of temperature on the properties of non-metallic systems as for example Polysulfides of Rubidium and Caesium by the use of thermal analysis.Raumchemie der festen Stoffe, Voss, Leipzig, 1934 At the age of 28, on March 15, 1905 he succeeded on being promoted to professor at the Clausthal University of Technology where he lectured until 1921. World War I An A7V tank at Roye, Somme, 21 March 1918 His work was interrupted when he participated in World War I. He held the rank of Second lieutenant throughout the war and was honoured with the Iron Cross first class. His military service is notable for his command of the German A7V tank that took part in first ever tank-versus-tank battle, during the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux in April 1918. During the battle his tank encountered a group of three British Mark IV tanks ‚Äì two \\"female tanks\\", armed only with machine guns and a single \\"male tank\\", armed with 6-pound guns. Both the British female tanks were damaged and retreated, as their machine guns had no effect on Blitz's A7V. In a running battle that followed, both tanks manoeuvred to avoid the other's fire while lining up on their opponent. Biltz's tank lost the duel ‚Äì it was hit three times by the British tank and heeled over on its side. The crew abandoned their A7V but five were killed by continued fire from the Mark IV, which went on to engage two more A7V tanks that had appeared on the scene. Despite attempts by Blitz to recover the tank, damage to the engine forced demolition crews to blow it up on the night of 23-24 April. Post war After the war, Biltz continued his academic career. He was appointed as professor and director of the inorganic- chemical institute of the Technical University of Hannover on 22 March 1921. Here he had his most successful years and he supported young chemistry talent such as Wilhelm Klemm and Werner Fischer. During his activities as a long-time member of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences, as member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina of Halle and as constant member of the board of the German Bunsen Society he applied his energies for the further development of sciences and research. In 1933 Blitz signed the Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State. In addition to the above memberships he acquired renown as an author of textbooks and some of them he wrote together with his brother Heinrich Biltz. Furthermore he was an academic author of the ‚Äòjournal for inorganic and general chemistry‚Äô for many years until his early retirement due to impaired health. He never married and remained childless.  Publications and books (options)  * Wilhelm Biltz and Heinrich Biltz;: ‚Äô‚Äô√úbungsbeispiele aus der unorganischen Experimentalchemie‚Äô‚Äô. 1.

Description  'The Czar' grows to a height of and has large light crimson, semi-double flowers up to across with prominent yellow stamens.  History  The plant was thought to have originated from a seedling selected by landscape gardener Neil Breslin of Camberwell, Victoria. Following Breslin's death in 1912, Mr. R. W. Hodgins of Hodgins Nurseries in Essendon noticed the plant in the garden and was so impressed by the beauty of the flowers that he purchased all the stock plants from his daughter, aside from the original shrub which was thought to be too large to be moved. This original plant was eventually relocated to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne in 1952. Hodgkins built up a stock of some eight hundred plants of the camellia. He had difficulty selling the variety, eventually resorting to practically giving the plants away at prices that varied from two shillings and sixpence to five shillings for each plant. Discouraged by this experience, he stopped propagating the variety. It was only about twenty years later, when these plants had grown into large bushes, that people began to talk notice and appreciate this new variety. By 1936 'The Czar' was regarded as \\"one of the finest of the single camellias\\".  Related cultivars  'The Czar' has two registered sports: Camellia japonica 'Hugh Kennedy' and Camellia japonica 'Fiona Capp'.

It is unknown specifically which African country the game originates from. Players attempt to form a 3 in-a-row of their pieces, and in doing so capture a piece from their opponent. The game has two phases: Drop Phase and Move Phase. Players first drop as many of their pieces as possible in the Drop Phase, then move them to form 3 in-a-rows which allows them to capture the other player's pieces in the Move Phase. The game is closely related to Dara. The main differences is that in Wali that a player cannot drop a piece on the board orthogonally adjacent to one of his or her own piece already on the board.  Goal  The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces is the winner. Captures are accomplished by forming 3 in-a-rows of their own pieces.  Equipment  A 5 x 6 square grid is used which makes for 30 intersection points. Each player has 12 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other the white pieces. The pieces are played on the intersection points.  Game Play and Rules  1\\\\. The board is empty in the beginning. The pieces are set beside the board. 2\\\\. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. Players alternate their turns. 3\\\\. Drop Phase: Players drop a piece onto a vacant point on the board that is not orthogonally adjacent to a piece of their own already on the board. A player may only drop one piece per turn. Players must continue to drop pieces until they can no longer do so according to the rule. If a player can no longer drop a piece, that player must pass their turn until the other player can no longer drop a piece also. 4\\\\. Move Phase: Both players are only allowed to move their pieces after both players can no longer continue to drop their pieces in the Drop Phase. This may mean that they still have a reserve of their pieces next to the board. It is uncertain, however, whether the remaining pieces in each player's reserve is ever dropped on the board later. A piece moves one space orthogonally onto a vacant point on the board. If a player forms a 3 in-a-row with their own pieces, then he or she can remove any one of his opponent's piece from the board. The 3 in-a-row must strictly consist three pieces (no more and no less) in order to allow the player to capture an enemy piece. It seems that 4 or more in-a-rows are allowed in this game even though they do not allow a player to capture an enemy piece. In Dara they are strictly prohibited throughout the game. During the Drop Phase a 3 in-a-row is impossible since it would require placing two orthogonally adjacent pieces. In Dara, 3 in-a-rows formed in the Drop Phase do not count, and therefore do not allow a player to capture an enemy piece on the board. It is also uncertain whether a player can capture an enemy piece that is part of a 3 in-a-row itself. In Dara, this is also prohibited. It is also uncertain how many enemy pieces a player can capture if in one move a player forms two or more 3 in-a-rows. In Dara, only one enemy piece is allowed to be captured per turn. Lastly, it is also uncertain whether diagonal 3 in-a-rows count. In Dara they do not count, only orthogonal 3 in-a- rows count.

History In early 1564, Spanish governor Pedro de Villagra was taking measures to protect all the towns and forts he already held against the growing Mapuche revolt and to organize a field army in Concepcion. He knew that one of the Mapuche objectives was to surround Concepcion, and preparations were made to support a long siege. Raids by Mapuche bands had made it unsafe for Spaniards to go farther than a league from the city. After a brief fight, 3,000 Mapuche in the Itata River valley under Loble defeated the troops of captain Francisco de Vaca coming with reinforcements from Santiago. Meanwhile, another 3,000 warriors under Millalelmo defeated the troops coming from Angol under captain Juan Perez de Zurita, at a crossing of the Andali√©n River two leagues from Concepcion.Marmolejo, Historia..., Cap√≠tulo XLV Both defeats had reduced the garrison of Concepcion to defensive measures and cut off Concepcion from aid by land. The survivors of the two battles had to retreat to Santiago and were in no condition to break through the investment around Concepcion. Meanwhile, the caciques Millalelmu and Loble with 20,000 warriors from the area between the Itata and Bio-Bio rivers, had looted and destroyed Spanish estancias in the vicinity of Concepcion, took their herds, and then settled down to besiege Concepcion in early February 1564. The Mapuche entered the city, sacking and burning it, the population crowding within the walls of its fortress with its 200-man garrison under governor Pedro de Villagra. The Mapuche then built a fortified camp on heights overlooking the city from which they descended to attack it. The siege lasted two months with continuous skirmishes. At the end of March two Spanish ships arrived bringing food that permitted the population to continue to withstand the siege for a much longer time. On the other side the Mapuche had used up local sources of food, and without pack animals and transport vehicles were finding it difficult to bring in enough to maintain their large force. Also the harvest season was coming and failure to bring in the crops would result in a winter of hunger for their families. With the recent news of the defeat of the Mapuche toqui Illanguli√©n at the Battle of Angol, they were also nervous that their undefended homes might be attacked from Angol or Santiago. On the first of April the Mapuche army raised the siege and dispersed to their homes for the winter.Diego Barros Arana, Historia General De Chile, Tomo Segundo, Parte Tercera La Colonia desde 1561 hasta 1610, Capitulo Segundo Sec. 4 Additional information References Sources * Alonso de G√≥ngora Marmolejo, Historia de Todas las Cosas que han Acaecido en el Reino de Chile y de los que lo han gobernado (1536-1575) (History of All the Things that Have happened in the Kingdom of Chile and of they that have governed it (1536-1575)), Edici√≥n digital a partir de Cr√≥nicas del Reino de Chile, Madrid, Atlas, 1960, pp. 75‚Äì224, (on line in Spanish) ** Cap√≠tulo XLVII, De c√≥mo los indios de la comarca y t√©rmino de la Concepci√≥n vinieron a ponelle cerco estando el gobernador Pedro de Villagra en ella, y de las cosas que acaescieron * Pedro Mari√±o de Lobera, Cr√≥nica del Reino de Chile , escrita por el capit√°n Pedro Mari√±o de Lobera....reducido a nuevo m√©todo y estilo por el Padre Bartolom√© de Escobar.

History Church End Mill was built by William Redington, a miller from Harlow in 1822 for John Fuller. It incorporated second-hand machinery from a smock mill from an unknown location and the total cost of the mill was ¬£564 10s 6d. In 1840, a new cast iron windshaft and Patent sails were fitted, but the windshaft snapped during a gale on 13 November, less than three months after it had been fitted. The sails landed on the outbuildings connected with the mill. The mill remained in the ownership of John Fuller until his death in 1887. The mill did little trade after 1894, and ceased work c1902, the sails being removed then. By 1907 it was being used as a studio and during World War II was used as an observation post, the cap having been removed by then. A new cap was fitted in 1974 by millwright Philip Barrett-Lennard. The mill has been house converted, with no machinery remaining inside. Description Church End Mill is a four storey tower mill with a conical cap with a ball finial.

He won the ITTF Pro Tour Grand Finals in 2002. As of August 2016, he is ranked seventh in the world. Career in table tennis Chuang's parents were both table tennis players in Taiwan. His father was a national doubles champion, and his mother Li Kuei-Mei was a member of the national team. After the end of Li's career as a player, her son, Chih-Yuan, became one of her prodigies in table tennis. Chuang started competing in 1989, at the age of 8. From the age of 13 his mother sent him to China for training several times. Chuang first made it to the Taiwan national team in 1998. In 1999, Chuang made his World Championships and ITTF Pro Tour debut. At the end of 2000, his mother decided to let Chuang train in Europe, including France and Germany. The process made his matches a combination of the Chinese and European playing styles. 2002 was a sparkling year in Chuang's career. He reached his first three finals on the Pro Tour, but ended them all as the runner-up. He entered the world Top 10 list in September, won the silver medal at the Asian Games and participated in his first World Cup. At the year's end, he consecutively faced the opponents who defeated him in the previous three finals of the Pro Tour, and recorded three straight wins at the Pro Tour Grand Finals. He defeated Jean-Michel Saive in the quarter-final, Wang Hao in the semi-final, and Kalinikos Kreanga in the final, claiming the title of Grand Finals Champion. Chuang won his first Singles title on the Pro Tour at the Brazil Open in 2003, and reached No. 3, the highest world ranking of his career, at the end of the year. He advanced to the quarter-finals in the 2004 Athens Olympics, ending the Games with a loss to Wang Hao. In the men's doubles, he and teammate Chiang Peng- Lung reached the last 16, where they were beaten by B≈Çaszczyk and Krzeszewski of Poland. In July 2008, his own table tennis stadium, Chih Yuan The Ping-Pong Stadium, opened in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. At that year's Olympics, he was beaten in the third round by Yang Zi of Singapore.

Chuang and Chen became the first athletes in Taiwan to win any World Table Tennis Championship title. On 2 September 2019 he announced not to play anymore for the Chinese Taipei national team.

It runs through Tuscany for a distance of about 70 km and is the river of the Val di Merse. Its sources are near Poggio Croce di Prata and Poggio di Montieri in the range of hills known as the Colline Metallifere. From here it takes a north-easterly direction for the first half of its course before turning sharply to the south-east. At Pontiella it receives from the right the waters of the Farma, a torrent born at Torniella, again in the Colline Metallifere). After a few kilometres the Merse enters the Ombrone at Pian di Rocca which lies half-way between the spa of Bagni di Petriolo to the west and Castiglione del Bosco to the east. The river has recently suffered from sulphurous pollutants deriving from the old and neglected mine-workings in the upper part of its course. Fish are far less plentiful than in the past, which may be put down to the exploitation of its waters for irrigation during the summer months; nevertheless there are many cyprinids, and pike are also found. The white mill which gives its name to the Mulino Bianco biscuit manufacturers is located on the upper course of the river: it was constructed in the early 13th century by monks from the nearby abbey of Serena.

The island has a land area of . It measures long and wide. The city of Unalaska, Alaska, covers part of the island and all of neighboring Amaknak Island where the Port of Dutch Harbor is located. The population of the island excluding Amaknak as of the 2000 census was 1,759 residents. Unalaska is the second-largest island in the Fox Islands group and the Aleutian Islands. The coastline of Unalaska is markedly different in appearance than other major Aleutian Islands, with numerous inlets and peninsulas. The irregular coastline is broken by three long deep bays, Beaver Inlet, Unalaska Bay, and Makushin Bay, as well as by numerous smaller bays and coves. Unalaska's terrain is rugged and covered with mountains, and during the greater part of the year, the higher elevations are covered with snow.US Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 7, Aleutian Islands The highest point on Unalaska is the active volcano Mount Makushin. Unalaska is the Aleut name for the island. Several theories about its origin exist; the most likely is that the name derives from the Russian word Ounalashka, an adaptation of the Aleut word for near the mainland, nawan Alaskax. History Native Unalaskans, called Unangan or Aleuts, to non-Unangan, have lived on the island for at least 10,000 years.https://www.alaska.org/destination/dutch-harbor- unalaska The island was first seen by westerners in 1741 by Vitus Bering.https://www.johnzada.com/unalaska-us-island-once-ruled-by-russia/ By 1759, at least 3,000 Aleuts lived on Unalaska island. A Russian settlement was constructed in 1759, but four years later it was destroyed by the Aleuts, together with four merchant ships. The attacks claimed the lives of 162 Russian settlers. The survivors managed to hold their own until 1764, when they were rescued by the Russians. This event triggered bloody reprisals against the natives which took the lives of about 5,000 Aleuts. By 1787, many Aleut seal hunters were enslaved by the Russian American Company and forced to harvest seal fur. By 1840, only 200 to 400 Aleuts still lived on the island.https://www.apiai.org/tribes/unalaska/ The 1788 expedition of Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez and Gonzalo L√≥pez de Haro explored the coast of Alaska as far as Unalaska Island, marking the farthest west the Spanish ever explored in the region. Also in 1788, English explorer James Cook visited the island, and spelled it Oonalashka in his journal.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Third Edition, 1797 Volume 13 article Oonalashka, and Volume 5 article Cook, James. In Moscow on May 31, 1988, President Ronald Reagan mentioned the meeting of Americans and Russians on this island in the 19th century as an example of early US- Russian friendship.

The neighbourhood owes its name to old handicrafts associated with shipping. The alleys between the houses were often associated with occupations or objects: There was an area in which ropes and cables were produced (string = Schnoor) and a neighboring area, where wire cables and anchor chains were manufactured (wire = Wieren). Schnoor is also the name of the main street in this neighbourhood. Another street there is Marterburg.  History  In the Hanseatic city of Bremen, the Schnoor was one of the poorer corners. While the rich merchants settled in the Obernstra√üe (Upper Street), which was meant as well geographically (ridge of the dune) as socially, or in the Langenstra√üe (Long street, along the Balge, Bremen's first harbour), the Schnoor developed in the 10th century as a district of fishermen. The inhabitants built thatched cottages on the little island between the rivers Weser and Balge. Therefore, during its first centuries it was liable to high floods. The first ferry service was established here, and the first bridge crossing the Weser was built around the year 1240. You can find an old wall and parts of a round tower which was erected around 1200, near the so-called Marterburg. In the 13th century Franciscan friars had settled and their St. John's church was constructed in the following decades. The street Schnoor today  Development  Today the oldest houses date back to the 15th century. Most of them are from the 17th and 18th centuries. While other parts of Bremen developed with plots of about one square kilometre and merchant's villas, the plots in the Schnoor have areas which are just enough for a single houses on 55 square metres. The narrow streets were not suitable for the increase in traffic from the 19th century. The quarter became one of the poorest parts of Bremen, a situation that meant renovations were unaffordable. During the Second World War the Schnoor suffered only slight damage, so that owners of the houses had to pay a Lastenausgleich after 1945. But by the mid-1950s the houses were in a pitiable state. The Senate of the Free Hanseatic Town of Bremen decided in 1959 to rebuild the historic area of the Schnoor. House owners were invited to restore rundown buildings with financial support from the State of Bremen. This development was in contrast to the common practice in many towns and cities in Germany and Europe until the late 1970s. The situation changed with the Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites (1964) so that in 1973 the Schnoor became a historic district under official heritage conservation through the State Monument Authority. One of the most famous houses which has been preserved in its original state is the Schifferhaus in the street of Stavendamm. Another historic building is the Landherrnamt (1856) which initially housed the authorities administering the State of Bremen. Landherrnamt & St.-Johannis-Schule The Birgittenkloster (Convent of Saint Birgitta), a small Bridgettine convent founded in October 2002 is located in the Schnoor, as is St. John's Church, a listed building with a history going back to the 14th century.

Biography He received a master's degree in law and practised it in A Coru√±a and was the chair for Mercantile Legislation and Maritime legislation in the School of Commerce in the city. In addition, he was director of the Nautical School. Politically, he initially belonged to the Partido Republicano Aut√≥nomo of A Coru√±a, becoming secretary in 1908. However, in the 1920s the party integrated into the Radical Republican Party led by Alejandro Lerroux. Abad was councilman of his city in several legislatures, occupying the mayorship between the years 1918 - 1919. In 1930, he was involved in the Lestrove Pact where on March 26, 1930, the A Coru√±a municipality of Lestrove, and political representatives aimed to create a Galician Republican Federation.

Named the Plan Abad Conde it included the construction of 12 torpedo boats, 8 minesweepers, 12 submarines, antisubmarine facilities, and arms and others. It also anticipated the modernization existing units in the Navy, beginning with armor and then updating the cruisers and destroyers.

Biography  She gained an M.Sc. in mathematics at University of Warsaw, Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry in 1956. She held position at Institute of Mathematics PAS until 1972. She received her Ph.D. in 1965 in the area of discriminant analysis (\\"Power of Test, and Separability of Hypothesis in Statistical Design of Experiments\\"). Her habilitation thesis, titled \\"Trend Estimation Problems in Time Series Analysis\\", was accepted in 1973. In 1967/8 she was visiting researcher in University of Wales (Great Britain), and in 1971/2 in University of Montreal. In 1973 she moved to the Institute of Computer Science, PAS. In 1977, 1979 and 1989 she was awarded by the Polish Academy of Science. In 1981 she visited Italy invited by CNR. In the 1990s she started (together with her team) so called grade data analysis, a science of applying copula and rank methods to problems of correspondence and cluster analysis together with outlier detection. (The adjective grade here honors statisticians of the first half of the 20th century, who called cumulative distribution functions in this way.Example: ) In 1993 the President of the Republic of Poland awarded El≈ºbieta Pleszczy≈Ñska with the Full Professor title in the area of mathematics. In 2000 she was an invited consultant of the Cambridge University. In the Institute of Computer Science PAS, she had been leader of the Statistical Data Analysis division for many years. According to the Polish law, professors in PAS must retire at the age of 70. Retirement in 2003, although a bit confusing, didn't stop her scientific and social activity.  Scientific views  Prof. Pleszczy≈Ñska is known for her criticism of the classic statistical approach. Classic parametric methods, like Pearson correlation coefficient, or least squares method produce comparable results only for comparable distribution types (in practice multivariate normal distribution is being assumed). Parametric statistical tests are derived from distribution assumptions. Classic methods fail if the input data contain strong outliers, and interpretation of their results should be different for different distribution types. In practice, the underlying assumptions are often not checked, moreover they are always violated ‚Äì there is no normal distribution in the real world, because every real variable is limited (for example people cannot be ‚Äì170 cm or +2 km tall), and the normal distribution implies positive probability density for every real number. In most cases the real distribution is skewed or discrete, which does not prevent people from using normal distribution methods. The extent of this violation can be measured, but its maximum accepted level is just a convention, not mathematics. The parametric methods always work out of their conditions of use. However, their results are othen considered valid, which leads to \\"scientific\\" validation of false hypothesis. For the reasons mentioned above, El≈ºbieta Pleszczy≈Ñska is a strong advocate of explorative data analysis and non-parametric statistics, like Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau, or grade data analysis.  Selected works    Social work  El≈ºbieta Pleszczy≈Ñska has cofounded Foundation Supporting Physically Disabled Mathematicians and Computer Specialists in Warsaw (September 1990). For many years she has been the Foundation chairman. The Foundation under her leadership is mainly interested in professional rehabilitation of physically disabled (not only mathematicians and specialists), based on computer techniques, like telework. Pleszczy≈Ñska has been continuously focusing attention of the public opinion on rights of disable people, in her periodical reports.  Private life  She has a son, Krzysztof Leski, journalist, and two grandchildren. She lived in Warsaw Wola district. Since July, 2019, in elderly care.

The plot is about a child of a king who can turn into 3 incarnations by changing season like turning to man for rainy season, turn to woman for cold season and turn to giant for dry season.  Summary  Three angels avatared to be the children of a king who ruled a big empire. The king has two queens but with the different personalities. The evil queen is named Ta Sa-nee. The good queen is Manee-nate (Thai: ‡∏°‡∏ì‡∏µ‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏£). Manee-nate gave birth to a boy after having six years of pregnancy. Unfortunately, the child was born with a large body as six-year-old kid and the most terrible is that he has two long fangs. (Phra Rahoo, Thai:‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏π) The king thinks his wife had an affair with an ogre when Ta Sa-nee confessed that she saw Manee-nate hugging and kissing the statue of an ogre. The king abandoned Manee-nate and Phra Rahoo in the forest. Manee- nate and Phra Rahoo were parted for some times. However, the mother and son met again by the hermit's recusement and the mother found out that her son turned into a different person, a beautiful girl called Chinda Mekhala (Thai: ‡∏à‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏î‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏Ç‡∏•‡∏≤) when winter comes and the girl turned into a handsome boy, called Phra Pirun (Thai: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏ì) when the rainy season comes, and when summer comes, Phra Rahoo will appear again. The mother and children were protected by two creatures, Monkey-faced human and a stone giant. Despite their happiness, they still faced several dangerous creatures that all became their enemies. Meanwhile, Manee-nate returned to the empire and explained everything about the children's power to the king. The king banished Ta Sa-nee and her family from their kingdom after realizing that she had lied to him. During the journey Ta Sa-nee met a magical buffalo-man, CoTun, that fell in love with her and dragged her home with him. Years later, they have a son, Sum See, together. Ta Sa-nee wanted Sum See to avenge her and make CoTun train him. When she complained about their home in the cave, CoTun transformed their cave into a castle to please her and named her his queen. He conjured them servants and soldiers. He sent men out to search for her father and old servants and brought him to live with them. Ta Sa-nee was embarrassed by her husband's true nature and told him to not reveal what he really was. As the children grew up, they turns into the handsome and beautiful men and woman. Feeling restless, Pirun leaves the kingdom to travel with his demon companion, Yunk. He met a tree nymph/spirit, Latana, and fell in love with her. They spend some nights in her tree home and he told her about his condition. When Pirun transformed into Chinda Mekhala, due to the change in season, Latana begged her to stay with her so she could be with Pirun. Chinda Mekhala explained to her that she couldn't because there are things that she must do. Latana refuse to listen and used her magic to stop her from leaving, but nothing works as Chinda Mekhala was stronger than her. Feeling sorry for the poor nymph, Chinda Mekhala explains to her once again that she must let them go and wait until its Pirun's season to come out. In Chinda Mekhala's journey, she ran into two men, who are actually the king of gods and his subject posing as humans. She saves them from bandits and they decide to travel with her for safety. In another kingdom, two beautiful princesses, Umpon and Upsun, are ordered to choose a husband by their parents. Men were called to the castle to let the princesses look at. While Upsun is happy about the occasion, Umpon hated it. Umpon refused to leave her room, but her mother forced her outside to the balcony to see the men. Angry at her mother, Umpon decided to choose the most hideous man in the crowd. Meanwhile, two ogres, father and son disguised themselves as human brothers, heard the news and decided to see how the princesses looked liked. They fell in love with the sisters.

When the father attempted to enchant Umpon, she dropped her flower garland and the spell accident hit her aunt instead. Seeing his mistake, the ogre back away into the crowd. Her aunt, who was called an old spinster, came out to find herself a husband to stop people from laughing at her. Hit by the spell, she threw her flower garland at the old ogre, and it landed on his head. Reluctantly, he married her. Chinda Mekhala having recently transformed into Rahoo a few days before, joined the crowd by accident. Seeing his fangs and ogre nature, Umpon threw her flower garland to him. He caught it without knowing what it meant. Umpon's mother is angry at her for choosing an ogre and sent her to like in a small cabin in the woods. Rahoo was madly in love with Umpon, but kept his distance as she's emotional about her parents abandoning her. On Upsun's wedding night, her husband is unable to touch her body. When the sisters were young their parents had prayed to the gods to protect their daughters. From then on the girls have a magical protective spell on them that cause evil men to feel a sensation of burning when they touch the girls. This did not happened to Rahoo because he was Umpon's soul mate and truly loves her. During their marriage, Umpon disliked Rahoo and treated him poorly. She revealed to her sister that she often felt angry when she saw his face. But her anger slowly dissolves as she began to fall in love with him. It is later revealed that Umpon and Rahoo were lovers in their previous life in heaven. She was angry in at him for leaving her and joining his friends to reincarnate. She reincarnated to be with him, but she still had her emotions of anger at his abandoning her. During those big fighting between the god, giant, nymph, Evil birds and buffalo creature. Phra Pirun lost tree-nymph wife. She was killed by the Ogre in order to help him.

The species is rare in cultivation; most plants that are labelled as H. fasciata are actually Haworthiopsis attenuata. Description Small specimen in cultivation showing the distinctively smooth inner surface of the leaves H. attenuata (right) The leaves of H. fasciata are fibrous The plants are generally small, less than 10 cm (4 in) high. The triangular shaped leaves are green with narrow white crested strips on the outside. At the end of the leaf is a non acute spine. The summer flowers appear in October and November, on the end of an inflorescence. The species has similar markings to Haworthiopsis attenuata, which is commonly grown as a house plant. The two are therefore frequently confused with each other, and a great many H. attenuata specimens are mislabelled as the rarer H. fasciata. However Haworthiopsis fasciata is rare in cultivation, and can easily be distinguished by the smooth upper (ie. inner) surfaces of its leaves. Its white tubercles occur only on the lower (outer) sides of its leaves; whereas H. attenuata has roughness or tubercles on both sides of its leaves. The leaves of H. fasciata are also often stouter and more deltoid. They tend to curve inwards more. Unlike H. attenuata, older H. fasciata specimens also sometimes develop long columnal stems. The most fundamental distinction, though not externally obvious, is that Haworthiopsis fasciata has fibrous leaves ‚Äì unlike H. attenuata, but similar to H. glauca, H. coarctata, H. reinwardtii and H. longiana.Haworthia updates - fasciata Haworthia fasciata - Information page at Haworthia- Gasteriahttp://haworthiaupdates.org/haworthias-small-relatives-of-aloe-1974/ Distribution This species favours the acidic sands of the fynbos vegetation type, in the area near Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage, in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.

The bonding in the rutile form is sometimes described as being partially covalent in nature rather than purely ionic; charge density determination by synchrotron x-ray diffraction indicates that the magnesium atom is fully ionised and spherical in shape and the hydride ion is elongated. Molecular forms of magnesium hydride, MgH, MgH2, Mg2H, Mg2H2, Mg2H3, and Mg2H4 molecules identified by their vibrational spectra have been found in matrix isolated samples at below 10 K, formed following laser ablation of magnesium in the presence of hydrogen. The Mg2H4 molecule has a bridged structure analogous to dimeric aluminium hydride, Al2H6.  Reactions  MgH2 readily reacts with water to form hydrogen gas: :MgH2 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 H2 \\\\+ Mg(OH)2 At 287 ¬∞C it decomposes to produce H2 at 1 bar pressure, Extract of page 65 the high temperature required is seen as a limitation in the use of MgH2 as a reversible hydrogen storage medium: :MgH2 ‚Üí Mg + H2 Potential use for hydrogen storage Its potential as a reversible \\"storage\\" medium for hydrogen has led to interest in improving the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reaction kinetics.J Huot Hydrogen in Metals (2002) in New Trends in Intercalation Compounds for Energy Storage, Christian Julien, J. P. Pereira-Ramos, A. Momchilov, Springer, This can be partially achieved by doping or by reducing the particle size using ball milling. An alternative approach under investigation is the production of a pumpable slurry of MgH2 which is safe to handle and releases H2 by reaction with water, with reprocessing of the Mg(OH)2 into MgH2. An application (yet to be examined) for a US Patent (US 2010/0163434 A1) has been made in respect of a hydrogen energy storage system using laser excitation to assist desorption of hydrogen gas from magnesium hydride.

He served as Minister of the Navy, Minister of Education and Science, Minister of the Interior, Minister of Housing, and Minister of Foreign Affairs during the reign of Alfonso XIII. Born to a middle class family with important political connections, he was the son of Obdulia Bonifaz (a relative of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla) and of C√©sar Alba Garc√≠a Oyuelos, a prominent Valladolid lawyer. Alba grew up in Valladolid and studied at the university, receiving a law degree. He also began working for the La Opini√≥n as editor-in-chief, and later bought the newspaper El Norte de Castilla in 1893, where he had also worked as a manager. Upon the death of her husband, Alba's mother inherited an estate in Cantabria, in the town of Noja. When Alba became the first Marquis of Albaic√≠n, the estate became the Palacio del Albaic√≠n. In 1918, after suffering from an accident in which his car crashed into a tree, he spent some time there recuperating.Revista Nuevo Mundo. 13 de Septiembre de 1918 He married Enriqueta Delibes in 1897 and began his political career in the elections of 1901, as a representative of the party Uni√≥n Nacional, earning a seat in the Cortes as deputy for Valladolid province. He won the seat again in the 1903 elections‚Äîafter switching to the Partido Liberal‚Äîbut would give up his seat to become Subsecretary of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, and in the elections of 1905, he would again give up his seat in order to become Governor of the Bank of Spain. In succeeding elections, which were held until 1936, he would again be elected deputy representing Valladolid, Granada, or Zamora provinces. From 1933 to 1936, he was President of the Cortes.  Ministry  He served as Minister of the Navy from 30 November to 4 December 1906 in the government of Segismundo Moret. He was Minister of Public Education and Belles Artes on two occasions: from 12 March to 31 December 1912 under Jos√© Canalejas; and from 22 March to 10 October 1918 under Antonio Maura. He was Minister of the Interior on two occasions: from 31 December 1912 to 27 October 1913 and from 9 December to 30 October 1916, both times under the Count of Romanones. He served as Minister of Housing from 30 April 1916 to 11 June 1917 under Romanotes and Garc√≠a Prieto, and adopted the ideas of the movement known as Regeneracionismo. He enacted two programs. The first, proposed ‚Äúin defense of Spanish values,‚Äù prohibited the issuing, introduction, and announcement in the Spanish market of debt securities and bonds associated with foreign governments. The second program reformed laws for tenants in Spain. He later presented to the Cortes some 22 projects concerning administrative and financial reorganizations and reforms, tax law reforms, monopolies, and economic development. He also successfully enacted a government loan worth billions of pesetas. During his second term as Minister of Housing (9 November - 5 December 1918), he concerned himself with food supply and transportation issues caused by the First World War. He proposed some agrarian reforms, but these were not carried out. He then served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 7 December 1922 to 15 September 1923 in a new cabinet under Garc√≠a Prieto. During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Alba exiled himself to France but returned in Spain in 1930. He refused to serve as head of the government after the fall of D√°maso Berenguer. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, he again exiled himself, this time to Portugal. He returned to Spain in 1945 but no longer involved himself in politics.

Affiliated with the Bloque Obrero y Campesino (BOC)(Workers and Peasants' Bloc), he later worked for the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) when the BOC combined with it. During the Spanish Civil War, he was the director of La Batalla, the organ of expression for the POUM. After the capture of the Basque region by Francoist forces in May 1937 he was arrested and jailed for six years in Valencia. After leaving prison, he went into exile in France, where he worked alongside Albert Camus, and in 1947 moved to Mexico, where he published various works. In Mexico he began a prolific literary production, in Spanish, French, Catalan and English, and became director of the Social Training center. In 1957, he moved north to the United States, working with various international groups and became a professor of the University of Kansas and in the Kent State University in Ohio. Initially identifying as a Marxist, he adopted social-democratic and anti-communist views during his exile. In 1974 he retired from Kent State University, returning to Spain where he died in 2003.

The validity of the species has been questioned by a number of authors, with many concluding it is a synonym of the similar Carangoides armatus, commonly known as the longfin trevally. However, this synonymy has not been accepted by all authorities, with Fishbase and ITIS both recognising it as a valid species. Like Carangoides armatus, the species is occasionally referred to as the 'longfin kingfish'. Taxonomy The species, as it is currently recognised, was scientifically described and named by the German naturalist Eduard R√ºppell in 1830, based on the holotype specimen taken from Massawa in the Red Sea. R√ºppell named the fish Citula ciliaria, placing the species in what was at the time a valid genus of jacks. As the classification of the carangids was reviewed, Citula was synonymised with Pseudocaranx, with C. ciliaria transferred to Carangoides, and the specific name changed from ciliaria to ciliarius, leading to the currently accepted combination. There is a possibility that Peter Forssk√•l described and named the species earlier, in 1775, which would make him the correct author under ICZN rules. He named a species Sciaena armata, but the description has been too vague to make any certain conclusions, and this name is considered a nomen dubium that cannot hold priority, and placed in synonymy with C. ciliarius. Georges Cuvier independently renamed the species as Caranx citula in 1833, also making reference to the name Caranx cirrhosus as a synonym of his new name. This name was apparently coined by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, although never properly published. These two names are considered to be junior synonyms under ICZN naming rules and are no longer valid. Synonymy with Carangoides armatus There has been extensive confusion in the ichthyological literature between C. ciliarius and C. armatus. R√ºppell described both 'species' in the same volume, and a 1973 paper by Margret Smith concluded he merely described both a young and an old individual of the same species. She recommended that C. ciliarius be given priority due to the fact it appears first in the book. A similar mistake involving misidentification of age stages apparently occurred in a 1937 analysis of carangids by Yojiro Wakiya, who divided C. armatus into four separate species, one of them being C. ciliarius. The most recent investigation into this taxonomic problem occurred in 1980, when Williams and Venkataramani confirmed synonymy between C. armatus and C. ciliarius, but recommended the name Carangoides armatus be kept. Most modern publications now list C. ciliarius as a synonym of C. armatus, with the last major revision of Indo-Pacific carangids also reaffirming this. Nevertheless, two major taxonomic authorities, Fishbase and ITIS, list the species as valid based on an older version of California Academy of Sciences Catalog of Fishes, which now treats C. ciliarus as synonymous with Carangoides armatus. This name is occasionally used in non- scientific literature such as fishing publications, although the common name given to the fish, 'longfin kingfish', is also applied to Carangoides armatus.

The name of the Ingolstadt‚ÄìKralupy‚ÄìLitv√≠nov pipeline is misleading, as the pipeline does not start in Ingolstadt and does not run to Kralupy and Litv√≠nov.  History  Negotiations to construct the Ingolstadt‚ÄìKralupy‚ÄìLitv√≠nov pipeline started in October 1990 and were concluded in 1992. Originally, the pipeline was planned to run from Ingolstadt to Litv√≠nov, but the route was changed to run from Vohburg to Nelahozeves. However, the original name of the pipeline was kept. Construction of the pipeline started on 1 September 1994 and was completed in December 2005. It was inaugurated on 13 March 1996. It is the main pipeline in the Czech Republic allowing oil supplies other than those of Russian origin. In 2003, the pipeline was modernized by improving remote control systems and increasing capacity.  Route  The pipeline starts from Vohburg in Germany, where it is connected with the Transalpine Pipeline, and ends at the oil depot in Nelahozeves near Prague in the Czech Republic. The German section of the pipeline is and the Czech section is long.  Technical description  The pipeline has a diameter of , and the pressure varies from in Vohburg to in Nelahozeves. The capacity of the pipeline is around ten million tonnes per year, of which normally 30% is in use. The additional capacity is reserved for securing oil supplies in case of disruption of Russian supplies through the Druzhba pipeline, as happened in July 2008. The control center, which controls the whole pipeline, is located in Vohburg. The backup control center is located in Nelahozeves. The tank farm in Vohburg consists of four tanks, with a total capacity of . The tank farm in Nelahozeves, serving the IKL and Druzhba pipelines, consists of sixteen tanks with a total capacity of .

En busca del oro verde (Madrid, 1928) and Bajo el cielo mejicano (C√≠a. Ibero-Americana de Publicaciones Madrid, 1930). His time in Mexico was marred by political unrest and violence. Madero had been assassinated in 1913, Emiliano Zapata in 1919, Pancho Villa in 1923 and Carranza in 1920. Farmer revolts, coup d'etats and crime became the political norm. Obreg√≥n was assassinated in 1928 and the Cristero War broke out with the cristeros representing the aspiration of the Mexican Catholics. Such was the mistrust of foreigners during this period, that Albinana was later expelled from the country under Plutarco El√≠as CallesAzkue, Andr√©s, La Cristiada.

Burgos delegate Albi√±ana returned to Spain in Burgos where he was later elected as its delegate in 1934, and reelected in 1936, although by this time his Valencian accent had become mixed with a Mexican accent causing some suspicion. Over time he gained the trust of the people in Burgos, catering to the needs of the neighbourhoods and readily answering questions. He brought about a number of infrastructural developments in Burgos including the legal work for the Compa√±√≠a de Aguas de Burgos (Burgos Water Company), installation of the telephone in Villarcayo and Medina de Pomar, and the installation and creation of Burgos Airport, securing important subsidies and investors to develop the region. Assassination and tribute He was murdered along with other prominent politicians by militia men when they took over the Carcel Modelo. With the triumph of the Nationalist faction, streets in several localities, mainly in his native Valencia, were dedicated to him. Published works *La medicina en verso.

There were two classes, based on engine power. The Class II were engines which developed more than 40 (later 50) HP. After tests with several trial locomotives, they were placed in service from 1932 onwards by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) and used on small stations for light shunting and marshalling work. They were intended to make the handling of goods traffic more economical. To do that, an appropriately trained controller had to be able to handle shunting duties using the locomotive. Accordingly, the locomotive was designed to be robust and easy to operate. Technology Light locomotives mainly used diesel motors (originally classified as K√∂/K√∂f/K√∂e by the DRG), as their source of energy, but there were also versions with Benzol motors, designated as Kb/Kbf/Kbe, and with electrical batteries (accumulator cars: Ks/Ka), as well as one locomotive with a steam engine. The third letter, if present, indicated the type of power transmission. If there was none, the locomotive had a mechanical gear system with a dry clutch. An f stood for an hydraulic drive and an e for electric traction motors, that were fed by a generator. K√∂f, therefore, stood for a light locomotive (Kleinlok) with diesel engine (√ñl-(Diesel-)Motor) and hydraulic transmission (Fl√ºssigkeitsgetriebe). Power is transmitted to the axles using a chain linkage. The locomotive is very small and yet of , standard gauge, width, but only fills about half the loading gauge profile. As a result, it can be loaded onto flat wagons. That was necessary, because if it had to move under its own power, its top speed of only would have seriously held up rail traffic. The light diesel locomotives were the first German diesel engines that were built in batches by several manufacturers. They were initially divided into two power groups: * Class I (initially , later ) * Class II (up to ) K√∂5750 in the Eisenbahn & Technik Museum R√ºgen DB had over 700 new K√∂f II engines newly built and further developed after the war. In the GDR, 32 K√∂ II were (re-)built in Dessau maintenance works for DR (among them the last ever built of 1968). More than 360 very similar vehicles were produced exclusively for industrial railways, series N3 with chain link drive and , referred to as N3 by the manufacturers, and series N4 with side rod drive and . The first proper development of small shunting locomotives in the GDR was the V 10 B, which was further developed into class V 15. A plan ‚Äì similar to the one of DB ‚Äì to build a series of more powerful K√∂f III was subsequently discarded and replaced by the DR class V 60 project. The DB later developed a K√∂f III with up to . In 1987, the Class 260/261 (up to 1968 called V 60) engines were reclassified as light locomotives and renumbered into classes 360/361. The brake effort of the K√∂ was initially only determined by the weight of the engine driver and the maximum force he could transmit via the brake pedal. With the introduction of new, more powerful motors (up to ) and the corresponding increase in tractive effort this proved insufficient; as a result many light locos in the DB and DR were equipped with a compressed-air brake, that could also operated the brakes of attached wagons. DR engines were not equipped with their own brake cylinders so that only the attached wagons were air-braked. In the DB the permitted top speed was raised from where compressed-air brakes had been installed. These locos can be easily recognised by their air reservoirs on the front. Because the open cab gave no real protection from the weather in winter, doors and windows were added during the course of main inspections from the late 1950s.

For a while, DB 323 412 and 323 415 were the oldest locomotives in the Deutsche Bundesbahn), as well as a handful of battery-operated light locos, of classes 381 and 382. Since 1999 no K√∂f IIs have worked for the Deutsche Bahn AG. However many remain working for other railway companies and societies, both in regular services and as museum locomotives.  East German Deutsche Reichsbahn  In 1970 the Deutsche Reichsbahn incorporated 378 machines of power category 2 in its EDP classification scheme as Class 100. After German reunification these became Class 310 in the DB AG. Only a few of the DR's light locomotives had hydraulic power transmission; they were grouped into sub-class 100.8. Under the old numbering scheme they were classified as K√∂f. Dead man's handles (Sifa) and radios for marshalling were not common. The Deutsche Reichsbahn converted many K√∂ to compressed-air brakes, this programme had not been completed when the Berlin Wall came down. In 1983/84 three DR K√∂ II were converted to metre gauge working for the Halle industrial railway and the Harz Narrow Gauge Railway. They have been preserved.

Early life and education Born to an Algerian-Belgian father Youssef Agag, who was a banker, and a Spanish mother, Soledad Longo √Ålvarez de Soto Mayor, Agag enjoyed an international upbringing in Madrid, including primary and secondary schooling at the Colegio Retamar, Pozuelo de Alarc√≥n, a fee-paying school belonging to the Opus Dei, an ultra-conservative Catholic movement, Paris and New York. Agag graduated with a degree in Economics and Business studies from the Colegio Universitario de Estudios Financieros (CUNEF) in Madrid, a private entity financed by the Spanish banks, and is fluent in four languages, Spanish, English, French and Italian. Political career Agag's political career began when, at the early age of 18, he became a member of Nuevas Generaciones (NNGG), the youth organization of the main center-right Spanish party Partido Popular, which at the time was in the opposition. Having been actively involved in politics while at University, he quickly moved up the ranks of the youth structure of the party, joining, due to his knowledge of languages, the international relations department. During that time Agag travelled extensively representing NNGG in organizations such as DEMYC and EYCD, center-right parties from Europe and the world that brought together youth political branches. Agag was elected International Secretary of NNGG at their congress in 1994. In the same year, Agag graduated in economics and was offered the position of Deputy Secretary General of the European People's Party. An offer that was as a direct result of the election ‚Äì a few months earlier ‚Äì of the German Klaus Welle as Secretary General. Welle and Agag met in the youth organizations level, and Welle took Agag with him to the EPP ‚Äì Agag was 23 at the time. That year, Agag also ran for a seat in the European Parliament, he campaigned in towns and villages in Extremadura; he was not elected at this time. As deputy secretary general, Agag was in charge of coordinating the different policy working groups within the EPP, and drafting of policy papers to be presented at the congress. As DSG Agag was a member of the EPP Summit, which meets before the European Council meetings and includes all of EPP's Heads of State and Government. In 1996 the Center-right won the elections in Spain, and Agag was offered the position to become designated aid of the President of the Government, Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar. The President had three aides, one diplomat, one military and one political (Agag). He was 25 at the time, and spent three years in that position. In 1999, at 28 years of age, he was elected a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Partido Popular. He entered the Economic and Monetary affairs commission, focusing in antitrust policy. In 2000 he led the Parliaments report on antitrust policy, and was active in redrafting the present antitrust rules. Agag and Wilfried Martens at the European People's Party congress in Berlin Earlier that year he had also been elected Secretary General of the European People's Party, replacing his colleague Klaus Welle. During his mandate as SG the organization expanded to the east of Europe, during that period it incorporated more than 20 new political parties from the region. Later that year, for the first time, the EPP won the European Parliament elections and became the largest political force in Europe. Agag was also very active in Italy. Making a controversial decision, and against some member parties within the organization, he pushed for the acceptance of Forza Italia, Silvio Berlusconi's party, into the EPP. This was of help to Berlusconi, who went on to win the elections in Italy in 2001. That year Agag intervened in the closing campaign rally of Forza Italia in Rome. In 2000 Agag was elected in Mexico Secretary General of the Christian Democratic International, renamed at that meeting Centrist Democratic International. This global political organization has over 90 member parties from all over the world. In 2001, Agag made a decision to cease his political activities in order to furtherance a career in business and sporting activities. The following year he was succeeded at the EPP by an old fellow during his times with Aznar: Antonio L√≥pez-Ist√∫riz. He remained a member of the European Parliament until 2002. Business career In 2002 Agag moved to London and started his own consultancy firm. He has been very active in multiple fields, including telecoms, energy, and especially media. Agag expanded his activities to financial advisory and fund management, forming a company called Addax Capital LLP, which is regulated by the FSA. Agag is currently Chairman of Addax and was joined in 2009 by Ignacio Mu√±oz Alonso, former CEO of Rothschild Bank in Spain, who worked for Lehman Brothers before that. In 2007, the Financial Times named him as one of the 10 \\"shakers and movers\\" of the Spanish economy, and he was described as a \\"political hopeful, economist, banker and indefatigable dealmaker\\". Agag is frequently mentioned in the media for his extensive range of contacts, both political and business, from all over the world. The Spanish newspaper ‚ÄòEl Pais‚Äô once described his Nokia SIM Card as \\"Priceless\\". In 2008, GQ Magazine elected him as the Spanish \\"Businessman of the Year.\\" Sports : Formula 1, Formula E, GP2 and football Agag business activity within sports mainly focuses on motorsport and football. According to the Spanish newspaper 'El Pais', Agag, together with Flavio Briatore, acquired very early on the Formula One T.V. rights for Spain. This was achieved via a U.K. based company and played a key role in the huge expansion of Formula One in Spain where television audiences have multiplied over the past few years. Agag is also very heavily involved in the 'sponsorship' side of the business, he is said to be behind some of the major deals lately achieved in the sport. Agag owns the Barwa Addax GP2 Series Team which won the title in 2008 and was runner-up in 2009. He took over the Team from former F1 driver, Adri√°n Campos, in mid-2007. The team's main sponsor is the Qatari real estate company, Barwa. Three drivers from Addax, Romain Grosjean, Vitaly Petrov and Lucas di Grassi, have made it to the F1. In 2010, Agag started competing in GP3 with the Addax GP3 Team. Through his connection within sport, Agag has formed friendships with Flavio Briatore, Bernie Ecclestone and Lakshmi Mittal. Together, they bought the English football club Queens Park Rangers in 2007. Agag served as chairman of QPR for a few months during the take-over then remained in the club as a shareholder. The plan was to have QPR promoted to the English Premier League, a feat that was achieved in 2011. He is currently in charge of the Formula E Championship, an electric car racing series. The inaugural season began in September 2014 and lasted until June 2015.

He also served as procurator in the Cortes during the Francoist regime. Life Hern√°ndez was born at Orihuela, in the province of Alicante. He began his ecclesiastical studies at the local Diocesan Seminary at the age of eleven, studying humanities, philosophy, and theology, and ten years later, in 1908, he moved to Rome, where he obtained his doctorate in canon law at the Gregorian University. He was ordained a priest on July 17, 1910, and on his return to Orihuela two years later, became a canon priest at the cathedral there. He was named professor of the seminary there and Prefect of Discipline. In 1923, he was named cantor of the cathedral, and in 1924, general vicar of the diocese. Almarcha became an important figure in the diocese before and during the time of the Second Spanish Republic because the bishop of the diocese, Javier Irastorza, was frequently absent. In 1914, Almarcha founded the Syndicate of Catholic Workers of Our Lord Jesus (Sindicato de Obreros Cat√≥licos de Nuestro Padre Jes√∫s), and 5 years later, founded the Federation of Agricultural Catholic Syndicates of Vega Baja del Segura (Federaci√≥n de Sindicatos Agr√≠colas Cat√≥licos de la Vega Baja del Segura).

Alonso III Fonseca (Santiago de Compostela, 1475‚Äì1534) was a Galician archbishop and politician. He was archbishop of Santiago de Compostela from 1507, and archbishop of Toledo from 1523. He was a major supporter of the University of Santiago de Compostela. He was the son of the archbishop Alonso II Fonseca and Alonso II's concubine Mar√≠a de Ulloa. His older brother was Diego II de Acevedo, first Count of Andrade. They had different surnames because a younger son (i.e. Alonso III Fonseca) would take the surname of his father (‚ÄúFonseca‚Äù) and the older son would take the name of his grandmother (the mother of his father the archbishop), which was ‚ÄúAcevedo.‚Äù Early life and career as Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela As archbishop, he was forced to confront Condado de Altamira, , because the count was meddling in the affairs of the Tierras de Santiago, and also put a stop to the injustices committed by the governors there, taking advantage of his close relations with the Spanish monarchy as well as the papacy. He was also involved in lawsuits against the Benedictine monks of San Mart√≠n Pinario, during a resurgence of this religious order in Galicia. He presided over his father‚Äôs funeral in 1512, at which Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, known as \\"The Great Captain\\", attended, and Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba symbolically offered his weapons to Saint James the Great (Santiago) at the funeral.  Political career  He assumed the leadership of the Galician nobility, who wished to maintain their privileges, and was named by Charles V as a member of the Royal Council. The Galician nobility was not included in the Cortes (Legislature) of Santiago and the Cortes of A Coru√±a, and Fonseca led the fight for their inclusion in these legislative bodies. Fonseca presided over an assembly at Melide, whose aims for the Kingdom of Galicia included demands for legislative representation and a new board of trade (casa de contrataci√≥n) based at A Coru√±a. He also served as a mediator in the War of the German√≠as. Archbishop of Toledo Coat of arms of archbishop. In 1523, he was named Archbishop of Toledo, and in this position, served as a patron to scholars, artists, and humanists. He baptized Philip II of Spain in May 1527. His main place of residence was at Alcal√° de Henares, where he died on February 4, 1534. He was buried at Salamanca. He had a son, the result of an affair with the noblewoman Juana de Pimentel. Fonseca's son later served the Spanish king and inherited property in Galicia. Legacy The definitive consolidation of the University of Santiago de Compostela comes with Fonseca. Fonseca was an extremely erudite man, a Renaissance man and patron of numerous artists of the time, who was in touch with important thinkers such as Erasmus of Rotterdam. Around 1507 the old Pilgrim's Hospital in Santiago de Compostela was purchased with the aim of transforming it into a university college. The Santiago Alfeo College, today known as the Fonseca College, was also built, which became the centre of the university life till the second half of the 18th century and still remains emblematic in today's university.

He is a clone trooper of the Grand Army of the Republic, cloned from bounty hunter Jango Fett, and serves the Galactic Republic under the command of Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano. Since his introduction in The Clone Wars, he has also appeared in the 2014 Star Wars Rebels television series and in comics, novels, and video games of the Star Wars Legends expanded universe. Like all clone troopers in The Clone Wars and Rebels, Rex is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. He is physically distinguished from other clone troopers by his close-shaved blond hair, and he is identified by blue markings on his armor and by stylized hawk eyes painted on his helmet. Rex was also distinguished by his use of twin blaster pistols in combat. He is described as a reliable and exemplary soldier, considered by Anakin to be his \\"first-in-command\\". Rex is characterized as believing it is his duty to not only carry out orders but also to protect the men under his command, but his belief in the Republic wavers over the course of the series. Initial development for The Clone Wars film chose Alpha-17, featured in Star Wars: Republic, to be the primary clone trooper character. However, Lucas felt this created too much alliteration with the existing principal cast, and a new character was created instead. Rex was developed as the central personality to which the troopers around him aspired and featured in story arcs exploring his character development. Rex became a favorite among fans, consistently placing in fan polls and Star Wars character ranking lists.  Creation and development  alt=Dee Bradley Baker appearing at a convention in 2016. Initial development for The Clone Wars film chose Alpha-17, featured in the Star Wars: Republic comic, to be the principal clone trooper character. However, because Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and R2-D2 (Artoo) were also principal characters, Star Wars creator George Lucas felt Alpha's name created too much alliteration between the main cast, and a new character, Captain Rex, was created instead. The name \\"Rex\\" was chosen by Lucas. Previously, the name Captain Rex was used for the error-prone rookie droid pilot RX-24 of Star Tours, who replaced an earlier concept of an unpredictable and risk-taking Clone Wars veteran. Voice actor Dee Bradley Baker voices all the clone trooper characters in The Clone Wars, including Rex. To differentiate the characters, Baker considered the personality traits of every clone, choosing one or two adjectives for each, and recorded each character separately. To aid with the vocal performance, Baker and supervising director Dave Filoni developed a \\"clone triangle\\" that arranged the characters by personality. Rex, characterized as the central personality type to which the other clones aspired, was placed in the center, and the other clones, who represented an excess of certain traits relative to Rex, were placed around the edges of the triangle. Filoni wished most for the series to address the fates of Rex and Ahsoka because they do not appear in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, which was released before The Clone Wars but is set after the series' timeline. In April 2011, he hinted that the two characters' stories were possibly connected and remarked: \\"A lot of people say they want to know more about [Ahsoka], and along with that goes Rex.\\" He also voiced the production team's conscious effort to write story arcs for Rex: \\"I think one of the other things is we have such a great development of Rex that we really want to keep telling Rex's story and things centered around Rex.\\"  Characterization and appearance  The official Star Wars Databank describes Rex as a \\"no-nonsense, by the book\\" and \\"exemplary clone trooper, brave under fire and dedicated to the men serving under him\\" who must adjust to his \\"maverick\\" and \\"headstrong\\" Jedi commanding officers. His training is described as having instilled a belief that a soldier's highest calling is duty, though his belief wavers over the course of the Clone Wars and he comes to question the purpose of the conflict. The entry characterized Rex as coming to admire and even imitate Anakin Skywalker's improvisation and willingness to bend rules. In \\"Darkness on Umbara\\", Anakin describes Rex as his \\"first-in-command\\" and second-to-none in loyalty or capability. alt=Concept art comparing three different clone trooper helmets. Rex is distinguished by close-shaved blond hair and stylized hawk eyes adorning his helmets; like all members of the 501st, his armor bears blue markings. Later in the series, Rex's armor bears tally marks, representing kills, and Filoni felt it communicated that Rex \\"is becoming something of a little legend\\" because he is \\"a long term survivor of the Clone Wars\\". He also bears a scar on his chin in homage to actor Harrison Ford, who played Han Solo in the original trilogy. Rex's later helmet design, first appearing in season four, was composed of elements from both the older Episode II-style and the newer Episode III-style designs. The T-shaped visor of his new helmet used the old visor design as a base and retained the old proportions, requiring some elements to be lowered to fit. Filoni developed an in-universe backstory for the design and felt that Rex \\"trying to wear the same armor\\" by welding together a hybrid version was a good character trait that added to his uniqueness. Filoni also characterized this specialized helmet and \\"hodgepodge of old gear and new gear\\" as indicative of Rex's distrust in the quality of the new armor and Rex's belief that with \\"classic stuff, the craftsmanship is a little better\\". Rex continues to wear his helmet and parts of his clone trooper armor in his Rebels appearances.  Fictional history   Star Wars: The Clone Wars  Introduced in The Clone Wars animated film and featured throughout the television series of the same name, Captain Rex, designation number CT-7567, is the commanding officer of Torrent Company within the 501st Legion under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Padawan Commander Ahsoka Tano. He fights as a soldier of the Grand Army of the Republic in numerous campaigns of the Clone Wars against the Separatist battle droid army. As a clone trooper, he was cloned on Kamino from bounty hunter Jango Fett and ages at an accelerated rate, aging twenty years in ten years. As Anakin‚Äôs Clone Captain, he goes on many missions with Anakin and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, sharing Anakin‚Äôs quick-thinking skills and recklessness at times. In a season four story arc, the 501st Legion is temporarily led by Jedi General Pong Krell. In the face of Krell's callousness toward clone lives and refusal to treat the troopers as individuals instead of numbered units, Rex is caught between his duty to follow Krell's orders and his responsibility to protect his men. Despite growing discontent in the ranks and calls for dissent from Fives, Rex does not openly defy Krell. However, Rex supports a mission led by Fives that is expressly forbidden by Krell but saves numerous clone trooper lives. After orders causes the 501st Legion and the 212th Attack Battalion to unknowingly attack one another, Rex leads the troopers to arrest Krell, who reveals he has turned to the dark side, admits he has been deliberately sabotaging the clones, and is later executed by clone trooper Dogma. Rex is also involved in a season six story arc centering on a conspiracy regarding the clone troopers. Fives discovers that inhibitor chips are secretly implanted into the clone troopers' brains and can be used to turn them against the Jedi. He reveals this to Rex before he dies. Rex is a principal character in the Bad Batch story arc, an unfinished story arc released as completed animatics. Shortly after Fives' death, Rex discovers a transmission from Echo, previously apparently killed in action, and leads a successful mission to rescue him. At Star Wars Celebration 2016, Filoni stated that Rex participates in the siege of Mandalore, the intended final story arc before the series' cancellation. Set during Revenge of the Sith, the arc sees Rex, promoted to commander, leading half of the 501st Legion reassigned to Ahsoka, who previously relinquished command upon leaving the Jedi Order, into an assault of Mandalore, with the intent of capturing the former Sith Lord Darth Maul. Though the assault is successful and Maul's forces are defeated, with Maul himself captured, Palpatine, who has revealed himself as Darth Sidious, issues Order 66, causing Ahsoka's clone troopers to turn on her, including Rex; however, Rex is able to resist the order long enough to warn Ahsoka. As a result, Ahsoka escapes and manages to remove Rex's chip, restoring his free will. For his treachery against the Republic, ARC Trooper Jesse demotes Rex to Captain and orders his execution. Rex and Ahsoka manage to escape the cruiser they are on before it crashes into the planet below. After the impact, Rex and Ahsoka bury Jesse and the dead clones in a mass grave, marking it with the helmets of the fallen clones. The pair then fake their deaths and part ways, both going into hiding for years to come. These story arcs were completed and aired when The Clone Wars returned for a seventh season in 2020.  Star Wars Rebels  Rex was first introduced to the Star Wars Rebels series in season two. Rex is introduced to the Star Wars Rebels television series, set fourteen years after Revenge of the Sith, in the season two episode \\"The Lost Commanders\\". Now a much older man due to accelerated aging, Rex lives with fellow clone troopers Commander Wolffe and Captain Gregor. The three are sought by the Ghost crew upon instructions from Ahsoka, and they ask the troopers for help in establishing a new rebel base. Though the three have had their inhibitor chips removed, allowing them to ignore Order 66, former Padawan Kanan Jarrus initially distrusts them. Wolffe, fearing the consequences for aiding rebels and Jedi, contacts the Galactic Empire to protect the clones. However, Rex convinces Wolffe the rebels can be trusted and repels the Empire, in turn earning Kanan's trust. Rex leaves Wolffe and Gregor to join the Rebel Alliance and to fight alongside the Ghost crew and Ahsoka against the Empire. In the epilogue of the series finale \\"Family Reunion - and Farewell\\", it is revealed that he was promoted to commander again and fought with Hera at the Battle of Endor. In other media In March 2016, Filoni supported the former fan theory of Rex being the older member of Han Solo's raiding party, previously known in Legends continuity as Nik Sant, on Endor in Return of the Jedi. In August 2017, writer Steven Melching shared concept art for the fourth season of Star Wars Rebels, and it was reported as a confirmation of this theory, making the first . Melching later clarified that at that time he was not aware if Rex and Sant are the same character, stating that due to the progression of the series, Rex's costume would naturally come to resemble those worn by Rebel Alliance commandos in Return of the Jedi. In a June 2019 episode of Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures, Rex appears in a Battle of Endor scene in the same pose and location as Sant in Return of the Jedi, retroactively implying they are the same character. Since his introduction in The Clone Wars, Rex has also appeared in comics, novels, and video games of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, also known as Star Wars Legends.  Merchandise  Rex was the featured character for the 2010 Star Wars merchandise trade dress created by Pilot Studio. The concept initially featured Anakin Skywalker, but discussions of other characters best suited to representing the brand led to Rex, \\"a strong, courageous character who is clearly one of the heroes of The Clone Wars\\". Pilot Studio was initially reluctant to use Rex because his helmet did not allow for eye contact, an emphasized element in the initial trade dress concept.  Reception  Captain Rex became a favorite among fans. Filoni noted that while older fans were excited to see Grand Moff Tarkin and Chewbacca appear in the series, younger fans appeared to prefer characters like Rex. Baker was surprised Rex became well-liked because the clone troopers were not established as distinct characters in the films. Rex was ranked 36 in IGN's Top 100 Star Wars characters, where he was described as having a \\"silly name\\" but \\"bad ass\\". His ability to evolve and adapt as a character and as a soldier was noted, especially his change from scorn to sympathy toward a clone trooper deserter. Eric Goldman felt that the Rebels reunion between Rex and Ahsoka was a poignant moment and the emotional highlight of \\"Relics of the Old Republic\\". He also noted that Rex's reintroduction and Ahsoka's complete trust in him raised more questions about Rex in the time between The Clone Wars and Rebels.

It was on this new viceroyalty where Diego de Alvear y Ponce de Le√≥n lived for almost thirty years. He continued his ascending military career reaching the rank of general and in 1781 wed Mar√≠a Balbastro, with whom he had nine children. autores.org Among the works during this stage in his life, he worked on the delineation of the border between Spanish and Portuguese territories. It was an endeavor started by king Charles III, where political objectives and military ideals where mixed. After the aforementioned colonial conflict, both kingdoms decided to clearly mark the borders of their colonial possessions. Charles III ordered that to accomplish this task, they had to divide the border in five sections to be studied separately. Diego de Alvear received command of the task for one of these sections to be studied, which encompassed the areas around the Paran√° and Paraguay rivers. Here he spent 18 years (1782‚Äì1800) doing Topography work, botanic studies and preparing reports on the Tupi and Guarani peoples. cervantesvirtual.com Battle of Cabo Santa Mar√≠a Bustamante's flotilla is intercepted by four British frigates commanded by Moore and Amphion reaches the Mercedes. by Francis Sartorius On August 7, 1804 Diego de Alvear, already a general, embarked in Montevideo en route to Spain in the frigate \\"Mercedes\\" carrying with him the riches accumulated after those many years of service in the River Plate area, and also his wife and children. The flotilla, headed for C√°diz, was composed of four frigates commanded by Jos√© de Bustamante y Guerra. On October 5, 1804 on the so-called Battle of Cabo de Santa Maria, near the Portuguese coast of Algarve, the Spanish ships were met by a British flotilla, and even though both countries were at peace after the Treaty of Amiens, they threatened the Spaniards. Diego Alvear and his son Carlos Mar√≠a were called to the flagship Medea, to serve as interpreters as they spoke English. The incident got out of hand when an intimidating British carronade hit the \\"Mercedes\\", which sank, carrying with her Don Diego's riches and the life of his wife and children. The only surviving son was Carlos Mar√≠a, who was with him. Two months later, in December 1804, Spain declared war on Great Britain. abc.com Second marriage and return to Spain After the sinking of the Mercedes, the flotilla was captured and sailed to England where Diego de Alvear was made prisoner, but with honours and privileges. The tragic family loss was not lost on the British to the point that the British government decided to reimburse don Diego part of his economic losses due to the sinking of the Mercedes. During his captivity he met, going to mass, the young Irish Luisa Ward, whom he would later marry and have ten children. In December 1805 he returned to Spain and in 1806 arrived in Madrid. As said Diego de Alvear married Luisa on January 20, 1807, in Montilla (C√≥rdoba, Spain). Spanish War of Independence and defense of C√°diz In August 1807, Alvear was put in charge of the artillery units defending the city of C√°diz, where he would distinguish himself defending the city from the French troops, who had invaded Spain in 1808. Diego de Alvear organized the city's defenses, having been one of his first successes to get the French Rosilly flotilla, interned in C√°diz Bay until then (as until a month and a half before France had been an ally) surrender in June 1808. Another important task was the reorganization of C√°diz's militias, a corps of two thousand volunteers called the \\"Distinguished Volunteers of C√°diz\\". In March 1810, Diego de Alvear was named military governor of the Isle of Le√≥n (today San Fernando) and his success at the defense of C√°diz would get him the Gran Cruz de Hermenegildo decoration. The writer Jos√© de Espronceda would later dedicate a poem to him: \\"To Don Diego de Alvear\\". Ferdinand VII reign: fight between liberals and absolutists After the War of Independence, Diego de Alvear requested permission to travel to England. The request was accepted and he lived in Great Britain between 1814 and 1817. Upon his return in 1817, he lived as a recluse in Montilla in the family's wine growing business, even though the political events of the country would lead him to actively participate once more. In 1820 Spain instituted the \\"Trienio Liberal\\" and in 1821 a series of movements by military forces quartered in C√≥rdoba would try to reinstate absolutist power. Diego de Alvear was opposed to this and organized a volunteer militia in Montilla, resisting the absolutist rebels until the arrival of reinforcements which ended the movement. As an award for his actions, he was named in 1822 Commander of the Montilla Militia and in 1823 he returned to C√°diz.

A man of culture Don Diego spoke several languages: Spanish, Latin, English, French, Italian, Portuguese and some Tup√≠ and Guaran√≠, having learned these two latter ones during his geographic work in the colonial sector he commanded. He also had great mathematical and astronomical knowledge, connected with his military activities in the navy and army artillery and the work he did delimiting the colonial possession borders between Spain and Portugal in the River Plate area. He wrote several books, including \\"Descripci√≥n de Buenos Aires\\" (Descriptions of Buenos Aires) and \\"Demarcaci√≥n de los territorios de Espa√±a y Portugal\\" (demarcation between the territories of Spain and Portugal). Modern times: the finding of the wreck of the Mercedes The wreck of the frigate Mercedes, whose sinking caused the death of Alvear's first wife and his children, was recently found and salvaged by the treasure hunter company Odyssey Marine Exploration between March and May 2007. This company, using Gibraltar as base, has recovered enormous quantities of silver and gold coins, plus cannon and copper ingots from the wreck. Most of these were sent to the United States by cargo plane from Gibraltar.BBC The Spanish government has sued the company on this issue.

It is headquartered in Gloucester. It is an independent registered charity. Its objects are to promote the Christian faith and to contribute to the funds of any charitable institutions and to carry out any charitable purpose. Initially, most of its grants were for the repair and maintenance of church buildings. Now it also supports projects that more widely benefit local communities and reflect changes in society. History Allchurches Trust was set up to act as the beneficial owner of the insurance company Ecclesiastical Insurance. It was founded by the Church of England and signatories included the then Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey, the Archbishop of York Donald Coggan, the Dean of St Paul's Martin Sullivan, the Secretary General of the General Synod of the Church of England Sir John Guillum Scott and others. Allchurches continues to maintain close affiliation to the Church of England, its main beneficiary, and one of its stated funding policies is to provide Dioceses and Cathedrals with block grants to help in their ongoing running. Its current trustees include The Venerable Annette Cooper, Archdeacon of Colchester, and Very Revd Jane Hedges, Dean of Norwich. Governance The charity is governed by a board of trustees who set its strategic direction and ensure it meets its goals and objectives. The current chair of the trustees is Sir Philip Mawer, former Parliamentary Standards Commissioner and former Secretary General of the General Synod of the Church of England. Income It does not fundraise; it derives its funds solely from the business it owns, Ecclesiastical Insurance and the subsidiary EdenTree Investment, which passes on to Allchurches Trust a significant proportion of profits. In 2015 Allchurches Trust received ¬£23m from Ecclesiastical Insurance enabling Allchurches Trust to give ¬£11.7m in grants to the Church of England dioceses, other Anglican denominations and other charitable projects. A 2016 Thanksgiving service in Gloucester Cathedral marked the donation within three years of ¬£50million to Allchurches from Ecclesiastical Insurance and its subsidiary. A personal message of thanks from Archbishop Justin Welby was read out by Bishop Nigel Stock, the Bishop at Lambeth and chair of Allchurches Trust at the time. Ecclesiastical Insurance has set itself a new target of providing ¬£100million for Allchurches by 2020. Criticism In 2017, survivors of church abuse criticised the nexus of corporate ties between Allchurches Trust, Ecclesiastical Insurance, and the Church of England. Ecclesiastical was founded in 1887 by the Church of England to conserve the profits of the insurer for itself. Since the 1970s, its profits have been paid to Allchurches Trust, which makes substantial block grants to dioceses and cathedrals in addition to grants to many parishes. The nexus has been accused of resisting and restricting financial settlements because it is too closely affiliated with the Church itself. Research carried out in Companies House revealed the extent of these grants. It has been estimated that between 2014-2020 the Church of England will receive in the region of ¬£100 million via Allchurches Trust. The search for information on Companies House also revealed that in addition to the senior church figures who have been trustees of Allchurches Trust, numerous bishops and cathedral deans have been directors on the board of Ecclesiastical itself. In July 2017, a BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme commented that the insurer \\"has had a string of senior members of clergy on its board of directors.\\" Keith Porteous Wood, chair of the National Secular Society, commented in an article See also *Ansvar Insurance *Church Commissioners *Churches Conservation Trust *National Churches Trust References  External links  National Churches Trust list of major grant funders * Income from Ecclesiastical Insurance Group in 2015 1972 establishments in the United Kingdom Church of England societies and organisations Christian charities based in the United Kingdom Charities based in Gloucestershire Gloucester Organizations established in 1972 ","title":"Allchurches Trust"},{"id":"18782359","text":"Bloody Mannequin Orchestra were an influential early 1980s punk band from Bethesda, MD.

Life and work He was son of Aaron Wilson, a royalist divine, and was born in London in 1626. He matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, in 1644, and entered Lincoln's Inn two years later, being called to the bar in 1649. His unswerving support of the royal pretensions recommended him to James, duke of York, through whose influence he became Recorder of Derry about 1681. His Discourse of Monarchy (1684), a tract in favour of the succession of the duke of York, was followed (1685) by a \\"Pindarique\\" on his coronation. In 1688 he wrote Jus regium Coronae, a learned defence of James's action in dispensing with the penal statutes. He died in obscurity, due perhaps to his political opinions, in 1696. Wilson was the author of four plays, showing a vigorous and learned wit, and a power of character-drawing that place him rather among the followers of Ben Jonson than with the Restoration dramatists. The Cheats (written in 1662, printed 1664, 1671) was played with great success in 1663. John Lacy found one of his best parts in Scruple, a caricature of a Presbyterian minister of accommodating morality. Andronicus Comnenius (1664), a blank verse tragedy, is based on the story of Andronicus Comnenus as told by Peter Heylin in his Cosmography. It contains a scene between the usurper and the widow of his victim Alexius which follows very closely Shakespeare's treatment of a parallel situation in Richard III. The Projectors (1665), a prose comedy of London life, is, like Moli√®re's The Miser, founded on the Aulularia of Plautus, but there is no evidence that Wilson was acquainted with the French play. Belphegor, or the Marriage of the Devil; a Tragi-coniedy (1690), treats of a theme familiar to Elizabethan drama, but Wilson took the subject from the Belphegor attributed to Machiavelli, and alludes also to Straparola's version in the Notti. He also translated into English Erasmus's Encomium Moriae (1668).

He was brought before the Justice Courts by two of his nieces and their husbands, but he died in Madrid before the case was solved, creating some problems afterwards with the numbering of the titles of both Dukedoms since then, as apparently he had been too quick claiming \\"legal\\", self-appointed, succession to both Dukedoms. During his period of ten years in Italy (1662‚Äì1672), he amassed a personal library of great value.

The club relocated to Sydney the following year and Foschini, again playing as a forward, kicked 42 goals.

Exempt charities are largely institutions of further and higher education, universities, industrial and provident societies, friendly societies, or national museums, that were established by Act of Parliament or by Royal Charter. These organisations are specified in Schedule 3 to the Charities Act 2011. Historically, they were treated as exempt from supervision because they were considered to be adequately supervised by, or accountable to, some other body or authority, such as Parliament. However this supervision was not always formalised, and the Charities Act 2006 (which was consolidated into the 2011 Act) introduced the idea of \\"principal regulator\\" for exempt charities. Where a previously exempt charity had no principal regulator it would become subject to registration with, and regulation by, the Charity Commission. Although outside the jurisdiction of the Charity Commission, exempt charities are still subject to the usual legal rules applicable to charities in English law and to the general provisions of the Charities Acts, and may seek advice from the Charity Commission Named charities The following list (comprising schedule 3 to the Charities Act 2011) lists institutions both by name and by generic type as exempt charities: Institutions with an exemption from the Charitable Trusts Acts 1853 to 1939 1(1)Any institution which, if the Charities Act 1960 had not been passed, would be exempted from the powers and jurisdiction, under the Charitable Trusts Acts 1853 to 1939, of‚Äî (a)the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales, or (b)the Minister of Education,(apart from any power of the Commissioners or Minister to apply those Acts in whole or in part to charities otherwise exempt) by the terms of any enactment not contained in the Charitable Trusts Acts 1853 to 1939 other than section 9 of the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855.

Tapeless television production The programming of the television networks consists primarily of broadcasting prerecorded images which, until very recently, were stored on tapes. But linear editing (or editing on tape) is being replaced by digital media or non-linear editing. Today, digital technology on hard disk (non-linear, by definition) is the common alternative. There has been clear confirmation of a migration towards this technology for some years, even though it will still take another 5 to 6 years or so for the hard disk penetration rate to increase from 30% to 70%. Television stations began migrating to tapeless interoperable computer platforms beginning in the late 1990s. Video recorders are rarely used nowadays for live productions.

It lies about north of Bryant Park and New York Public Library and next to the New York Yacht Club. The hotel is inspired by French traditions in furnishings and theme, and the hotel staff are bilingual in French and English. Completed in 2000, the , 30-floor, 398-guest room limestone and glass building was awarded the 2000 Emporis Skyscraper Award. History Construction on the hotel began in 1997, and it opened in the year 2000. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was reportedly responsible for funding the project after a design by Brennan Beer Gorman was chosen in an architectural competition which included entries from architects such as Michael Graves & Associates. After construction the building was awarded the 2000 Emporis Skyscraper Award. Strauss-Kahn rape allegation On May 14, 2011, a 32-year-old housekeeper at the hotel, an immigrant from Guinea, alleged that IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss- Kahn attempted to rape her in his hotel room. She had walked into his room as he was having a shower although he had not yet checked out. Strauss-Kahn was at New York airport, and his plane was ready to take off when airport police asked that the plane be stopped a few minutes before takeoff. He was escorted off the plane and placed under arrest. The criminal case was later dismissed, and he settled out of court with his accuser in a civil case. Architecture 200px Described as \\"one of midtown's new, glitzy \\"boutique\\" hotels,\\" and claiming to offer a \\"m√©lange harmonieux du style fran√ßais et de l'esprit\\" it is tall with 30 floors and has 398 luxury guest rooms including 52 suites. The architectural design by Brennan Beer Gorman features limestone and glass, with a T-shaped base. The facade was architecturally inspired by Parisian Moderne limestone buildings and according to Frommer's Guide exudes \\"old-world French elegance\\" far beyond its years of existence as a hotel.

Ring magazine founder Nat Fleischer rated Griffo as the eighth greatest featherweight of all time.Cyber Boxing Encyclopedia - Young Griffo CyberBoxingZone.com He was inducted into the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame in 1954, the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991, and the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003. During his career he defeated Abe Willis, champion Ike Weir, Horace Leeds, and Joe Harmon. He won bouts against champion Torpedo Billy Murphy a total of three times, twice in World Featherweight title matches. A prolific boxer of great opponents, after coming to America, he fought champions Solly Smith, \\"Kid\\" Lavigne, Joe Gans, Tommy Ryan, George Dixon, Frank Erne, and featherweight contender Joe Bernstein. He was recorded as fighting over two hundred professional fights in his career. Early life and titles Albert Griffiths was born at Millers Point, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia on 1 January 1871. He took his ringname \\"Young Griffo\\" early in his career. Griffo turned pro in 1886 and until the age of twenty-two fought in his home land of Australia. For four of his most successful years as a boxer, Harry Tuthill was his athletic trainer and Hugh Behan and Sam Tuckhorn were managers, though by his mid career Griffo went through a host of trainers and managers who tired of his drinking habits and unwillingness to train.Tuthill was his trainer in \\"Who was Greatest Boxer in the Ring\\", The Daily Republican, Monongahela, Pennsylvania, pg. 2, 10 May 1909Behan was his manager in, \\"Fight is Off, Young Griffo\\", St. Louis Post- Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 16, 9 May 1895Sam Tuckhorn was manager in 1893 in \\"Young Griffo is Said to be Well\\", Butte Daily Post, Butte, Montana, pg. 8, 13 January 1903 He said in a 1902 interview with The Cincinnati Enquirer that Larry Foley of Sydney had acted as an important early boxing mentor, and indeed Griffo had trained at Foley's boxing school at Sydney's White Horse Hotel where several of the greatest champions had spent time, including triple weight class champion Bob Fitzsimmons.\\"Death of Griffo\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer\\", Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 16, 8 December 1927 Taking Australian Featherweight Championship On 26 December 1889, he fought Nipper Peakes in Melbourne for the Australian Featherweight Championship winning in an eight-round points decision. He held the title for several years defending it against Abe Willis and George McKenzie in Sydney in 1890. Taking World Featherweight Title vs. Billy Murphy, 1890 Billy Murphy, World Featherweight Champion He first took the World Featherweight Title against Torpedo Billy Murphy on 2 September 1890 at the White Horse Hotel in Sydney in a fifteen-round decision. It was one of the first World Title matches ever held in Australia. At the time, the United States only recognized bouts that took place in North America, and so did not fully accept Griffo's claim to the World Title, but both Australia and Great Britain did.\\"First World Title Fight in Australia\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, pg. 3, 18 November 1967 Subsequent to his death, the World Boxing Organization accepted Griffo's claim to the World Featherweight Title. He defended the British and Australian version of the World Featherweight title against Paddy Moran on 4 November 1890 in a thirteen-round decision in Sydney. He defended the World Featherweight Title against George Powell on 12 March 1891 in a twenty-round disqualification in Sydney. Griffo defended the World Featherweight Title a third time against Torpedo Billy Murphy again in Sydney, Australia on 22 July 1891, winning in a twenty-second round disqualification. In his final defense of the World Featherweight Title, he defeated Mick McCarthy on 22 March 1892 in Sydney in a fourth-round decision. He eventually vacated the title to fight at a higher weight. He fought for the Australian Lightweight Title on 25 July 1892 against Jim Barron in Sydney, Australia in a twenty-two round bout that was declared a draw. The referee called the bout when both boxers appeared too battered and exhausted to continue. According to one source, an audience of 2,500 were present.Burke, Billy, \\"Old Timer's Scrapbook\\", The Wilkes-Barre Evening News\\", pg. 10, 12 June 1943 Boxing in the United States In 1893, at the age of 22, he came to America. He boxed in the United States between November 1893, until his retirement from boxing in 1904 and remained there until his death in 1927. He arrived first in San Francisco, and may have boxed a few bouts on the West Coast upon his arrival, though accounts differ.\\"Young Griffo, Marvel of Antipodes, World's Greatest Boxer\\", Pittsburgh Post, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 28, 11 March 1923 One of his first bouts in America was against \\"Young Scotty\\" in Chicago on 13 November 1893, where he was reputed to have challenged his opponent to hit him for several minutes while he bobbed his head and managed to avoid nearly every blow. At least one newspaper reported after his death that even in this early stage of his career, he had been pulled from a bar room before the fight with the skilled Black boxer, though his defensive skills in the bout were considered to have been extraordinary with Scotty unable to land a blow.Newland, Russ, \\"Young Griffo, The Australian Marvel\\", Reno Gazette Journal, Reno, Nevada, pg. 12, 25 April 1944 Bout with future World Featherweight Champion Solly Smith On 3 January 1894, he fought future World Featherweight champion Solly Smith at the Tivoli Theatre in Chicago to a six-round draw. Smith, who had distinguished himself by the time he met Griffo, would take the World Featherweight Championship the following year. On 23 January 1894, he fought an eight-round draw with John Van Heest in Chicago, making an impressive performance.Lavigne, George, \\"John L. Said Lavigne Would be Next Champ\\", The Winnipeg Tribune, Winnipeg, Canada, pg. 15, 20 December 1927 Match with Ike Weir, former world champion On 17 March 1894, Griffo defeated Ike Weir at the Second Regiment Armory in Chicago. Griffo, as a lightweight, outweighed Weir considerably and dominated the bout, which was stopped by the police in the third round when Weir was down. Weir announced retirement after the bout but returned to the ring for a few more professional bouts and exhibitions.White, Charley, \\"Inside the Ring with the Great Fighters\\", New York Evening World, New York, New York, pg. 7, 29 July 1911 Although the bout was officially called a draw by the referee, Griffo knocked Weir down twice in the third round, with Weir taking a while to get to his feet. Many in the crowd were displeased with the official Draw decision.\\"The Ring\\", Detroit Free Press, Detroit, Michigan, pg. 6, 18 March 1894 According to the Inter Ocean, as many as five thousand were in attendance to watch \\"three of the fastest, fiercest and most brutal rounds ever fought in an American prize ring\\". Young Griffo made a veritable chopping block of Ike O'Neil Weir, the \\"Befast Spider\\".Griffo won the bout decisively in \\"Stopped by Police\\", The Inter Ocean, Chicago, Illinois, pg. 10, 18 March 1894 It is important to note that according to one source, Griffo may have outweighed Wier by as much as thirty pounds during the bout, though discrepancies in the weights of opponents was more common in this era of boxing.\\"Belfast Spider was Favorite in Duluth\\", The Labor World, Duluth, Minnesota, p. 5, 30 March 1907 Several newspaper accounts of the fight, written after Griffo's death, wrote that he had been drinking prior to the bout, though by most accounts he had the edge during most of the fighting, and Weir was a worthy opponent.Griffo had been drinking prior to the Weir bout in \\"Young Griffo\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 24, 8 December 1927 On 27 August 1894, he lost to the famed seven year undefeated World Lightweight Champion Jack McAuliffe in Brooklyn, New York, losing in a ten-round points decision. McAuliffe had lost his World Lightweight Championship only the year before. Griffo had lost few of his fights by referee decision prior to his bout with the legendary McAuliffe. Due to McAuliffe's extraordinary record as lightweight champion, he was considered one of Griffo's most skilled opponents. Meeting three champions Griffo fought an assortment of opponents who would at one time hold world championships. =Bouts with Lightweight contender \\"Kid\\" Lavigne= On 10 February 1894, he fought future World Lightweight Champion George \\"Kid\\" Lavigne for the first time in an eight-round draw in Chicago. On 12 October 1895, he fought Lavigne in a twenty-round draw by points decision in Queens, New York. Lavigne would take the World Lightweight Championship only the following year. He subsequently fought an eight-round draw with the hard- hitting red head boxer Johnny Griffin at the Casino in Boston on 23 April 1894. On 17 September 1894, he knocked out Eddie Loeber in only 2 minutes 36 seconds of the first round at the Seaside Athletic Club in Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, wrote that the two men were very \\"poorly matched\\", and that it was a relief when the referee Dominick McAffrey stopped the bout. Hundreds of spectators struggled to shake hands with Griffo after the fight's conclusion.\\"Boxing at the Seaside\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 4, 18 September 1894 On 4 March 1895, he defeated Horace Leeds at the Seaside Athletic Club in Coney Island in a twelve-round bout in front of a sizable crowd of 4000 spectators. One reporter believed Griffo to be over the 133 pound weight limit, and fighting at a weight of as much as 140. The fighting was fierce, and both men were described as being \\"badly pummeled\\" in a close bout that had the betting about even.Badly pummeled in \\"Victory for Young Griffo\\", San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, 5 March 1895\\"A Good Fight\\", The Times Democrat, New Orleans, Louisiana, pg. 8, 5 March 1895 He lost to Leeds on 7 August 1897, in a four-round newspaper decision in Atlantic City, New Jersey. During this period, he was managed by Hugh Behan, though Griffo had an assortment of trainers in his career.\\"Fight is Off, Young Griffo\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 16, 9 May 1895 =Bouts with world champion George Dixon= On 28 October 1895, he fought the great Black Canadian champion George Dixon in a ten-round draw by points decision in Manhattan. Dixon had taken the World Featherweight Championship in 1891, and was one of the first recognized world champions. Griffo would fight Dixon two additional times in well attended matches. One source described their twenty-round draw as a \\"battle that bristled throughout with glittering skill and generalship.\\"\\"Young Griffo\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 24, 8 December 1927 On 19 January 1895, they would fight a 25-round draw in New York's Coney Island. His manager Hughey Behan had him jailed briefly before the Coney Island bout with Dixon so he could train in a sober state. =Arrests for assault and disorderly conduct= On 11 April 1896, he was arrested at a Casino he frequented in College Point, Long Island, on charges of assault against William Connors, a town trustee. He was discharged shortly after to attend a scheduled bout against boxer Charles McKeever.\\"Griffo's Arrest at College Point\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn New York, pg. 5, 13 April 1896 On 13 April, the day he would have faced trial on the assault charge, he lost the twenty round bout at the Empire Athletic Club with McKeever in Queens, New York, on a points decision of the referee. On 9 June 1896, he was arrested for driving intoxicated and disorderly conduct in Coney Island, New York, and was arraigned at the Coney Island Police Court. He was sentenced to twenty-five days in prison after pleading guilty.\\"Young Griffo Sent to Jail\\", The Morning News, Wilmington, Delaware, pg. 1, 10 June 1896 Around 20 November 1897, he was arrested for vagrancy in St. Louis, Missouri, but several nights drinking at a bar may have precipitated the arrest. He was not held for long and fought a bout the following month in California.Arrested for vagrancy in \\"Young Griffo is in Prison\\", St. Louis Post Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 8, 21 November 1897 On 28 September 1898, he was arrested in Chicago found running naked on State Street for a quarter mile. He reportedly assaulted the three officers who tried to arrest him. Another source states he had been drinking the night the incident occurred.Griffo was drinking before he went running naked in \\"Pugilist Runs Amuck\\", Lawrence Weekly World, Lawrence, Kansas, pg. 1, 29 September 1898Found running on State Street in Chicago in \\"Pugilist in Straightjacket\\", The Morning News, Wilmington, Delaware, pg. 1, 29 September 1898 On 14 January 1899, he was arrested and brought to Chicago's Harrison Street Police Station for struggling with a police officer to prevent the arrest of a Tom McGinty from the Clover Leaf Saloon, around 2:00 AM in the morning but released shortly after.Arrested for struggling with a police officer in \\"Young Griffo Again\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 17, 15 January 1899 He was sent to an insane asylum on 24 March 1899, after being judged insane in Chicago.Sent to insane asylum in \\"Young Griffo is Insane\\", The San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, pg.2, 24 March 1899 He was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery against James H. Wilkerson on 9 September 1901, but only one source mentions this arrest.Assault against Wilkerson in \\"Young Griffo Arrested\\", The Times, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 10, 10 September 1901 On 2 February 1902, he was discovered in the cold in a vacant lot near the Bridewell in Chicago, where he had been serving a sentence for disorderly conduct. It was feared he would lose his hands from frostbite.\\"Young Griffo Found Nearly Frozen\\", The Ottawa Daily Republic, Ottawa, Kansas, pg. 1, 3 February 1902 On 6 February 1902, he was sent back to an asylum.\\"Young Griffo Insane\\", The Scranton Republican, Scranton, Pennsylvania, pg.1, 7 February 1902 Around 25 February 1903, he was sent back to the Bridewell in Chicago for three months for \\"making trouble\\".Sent to the Bridewell in 1903 in \\"Young Griffo in Jail\\", The Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, pg. 3, 26 February 1903 =Three bouts with future Welterweight Champion Joe Gans= Champion Joe Gans He fought the legendary World Light and Welterweight Champion Joe Gans three times, though never winning a bout. Griffo's 18 November 1895 bout with Gans in Gan's home of Baltimore, Maryland, appeared to some to be only an exhibition, with which many in the crowd were disappointed. A few even considered the bout a \\"fix\\", as Griffo told the audience, he had agreed not to \\"put out\\" Gans during the bout.\\"Crowd Called it a Fake\\", The Wichita Eagle, Wichita, Kansas, pg 2, 19 November 1895Gans showed more punching ability and stamina on 10 July than Griffo in \\"Stopped the Fight\\", The Wilkes-Barre News, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 1, 11 July 1900 Griffo considered his fifteen-round draw in Athens, Pennsylvania, at the Olympic Athletic Club on 21 September 1897 one of his best, as well as one of Gans' most skilled displays.Griffo said his 21 September 1897 bout with Gans in Athens, Pennsylvania was his best in \\"My Hardest Fight As Told by Young Griffo\\", Shamokin News-Dispatch, Shamokin, Pennsylvania, pg. 8, 25 September 1897 Of his 10 July 1900 bout with Gans, an eighth-round loss by technical knockout at the Seaside Athletic Club, one source wrote, the referee stopped the bout one minute and thirty seconds into the eighth round when \\"Griffo was so far gone that another punch from Gans would have put him out.\\" Griffo was reported to have shown some of his early form, but was no match for the blows and conditioning of the \\"old master\\" Joe Gans, and was believed by one reporter to have had less stamina as the fight wound on.\\"Close Decision\\", Decatur Herald, Decatur, Illinois, pg. 1, 11 July 1900 Griffo was down in both the first and seventh rounds, and he took off nearly a year from his boxing after this last fight with Gans. Bouts with champions Frank Erne, and Billy Murphy He met one time World Featherweight and Lightweight champion Frank Erne on 20 December 1895 in a four-round non- title fight that resulted in a draw in Buffalo, New York. He defeated Torpedo Billy Murphy in a non-title match ending in an eight-round points decision at the Casino in Boston on 7 May 1894. His twenty-round draw bout with Jack Everhardt on 10 July 1896 in Buffalo, New York, was billed as a World 135 pound title. He had previously met Everhardt in a pre-arranged six-round draw in Brooklyn on 25 May, at which the crowd would have preferred a decision by the referee. He lost to World Welter and Middleweight Champion Tommy Ryan on 21 June 1897 in a non-title match in a third-round technical knockout in Brooklyn, New York. Late boxing career Serving time On 15 August 1896, he was sentenced in Brooklyn to one year in prison for an assault on William Gottlieb the previous April. He did not box from August 1896 until June 1897.Received a one year sentence in jail in \\"Young Griffo's Sentence\\", The Evening Sentinel, Santa Cruz, California, pg. 1, 15 August 1896 Boxing after release On 12 July 1897, he fought well known lightweight Owen Ziegler, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a six-round bout, which he won by newspaper decision. He considered Ziegler one of his more important opponents. He fought a close bout with Horace Leeds on 7 August 1897 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in which The Philadelphia Inquirer felt Leeds had received more points. On 18 November 1897, Griffo was believed to have been drunk in a contest with Tom Tracey at the Colliseum in St. Louis. He rolled out of the boxing ring in the first round, and referee George Siler declared a No Contest. One source confirmed his story that he had been in a car accident prior to the fight which was the cause of his inability to complete the first round. The San Francisco Call wrote that Griffo's vehicle had been struck by a street car on the way to the bout, and that he had suffered a sprained shoulder as a result. He and two of his seconds were treated for injuries received as a result of the accident.\\"Badly Hurt in a Collision\\", The San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, pg. 2, 19 November 1897 He was defeated in an upset by Frank McConnell before three thousand spectators on 3 February 1898 in a fifteen rounds points decision in San Francisco, California. McConnell had only recently emerged from the amateur ranks, and had relatively little experience as a professional. Griffo showed great defensive skills in several rounds, but McConnell won the bout by taking the offensive throughout most of the fight.\\"He Met a Surprise\\", The Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City, Utah, pg. 2, 4 February 1898 On 26 March 1898, he won a bout with the well known Black boxer, Young Peter Jackson in Red Bluff, California on a fourth round disqualification. A few at ringside claimed that Jackson was actually Joe Gans, but this was found to be untrue.\\"Young Griffo Wins on a Foul\\", Pittsburgh Daily Post, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 6, 28 March 1908 Tragic bout with Bull McCarthy On the evening of 27 April 1898, he fought Joseph Devitt, who gave the name of the boxer \\"Bull\\" McCarthy, in Sacramento, California. Griffo won the twenty round bout by knockout, but Devitt died the following evening of his injuries at Sister's Hospital. Devitt was diagnosed with a brain concussion, likely caused by a rain of blows to his head during the bout. Griffo was briefly taken into custody on charges of manslaughter as a result of the fight. The tragic result was a source of strong remorse for Griffo but it did not deter him from continuing his profession.The San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, pg. 10, 29 April 1898 Late career decline On 19 December 1901, he was advised to retire from boxing due to a \\"valvular affection of the heart that may bring death to him in the ring at any time.\\" The diagnosis was made by a Dr. McGregor of the Olympic Athletic Club, and if accurate should have ended his boxing career.\\"Young Griffo Must Retire\\", The Daily Review, Decatur, Illinois, pg. 1, 19 December 1901 On 22 August 1902, he lost to three-time World Featherweight Title contender Joe Bernstein in Baltimore, Maryland in a twenty-round points decision. He lost to lightweight boxer Joe Tipman in a fifth-round knockout on 29 September 1902 in Baltimore. In December 1902, after defeating Jack Bain in a ninth-round knockout in Baltimore, he took off at least a year from boxing before his fight with George Memsic around December 1903, also in Baltimore. In this stage of his career he was managed by Sam Tuckhorn, who was hoping to revive his career and convince the public of his fighting skills, but Griffo was nearing the end of his career.\\"Young Griffo is Said to Be Well\\", The Butte Daily Post, Butte, Montana, pg. 8, 13 January 1903 On 7 December 1903 in Peoria, Illinois, he defeated Jim Kenney in a four-round decision. Griffo showed great speed and cleverness according to the referee, Tom Dunn.\\"Corbett Wants Hamlin to Rush\\", Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana, pg. 7, 13 December 1903 One of his last well publicized bouts was a loss by first-round knockout against Tommy White on 10 February 1904 in Chicago, Illinois. He was already thirty-three at the time, and his age, drinking, and enormous number of previous fights had begun to tell on his speed and endurance in the ring. He was arrested in September 1909 in Chicago, as relatives from Australia had requested his arrest so as to help him obtain treatment for his drinking.Arrested in Chicago in 1909 in \\"Young Griffo is Complete Wreck\\", Harrisburg Daily Independent, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, pg. 9, 6 September 1909 Cyber Boxing Zone has him fighting two six round no decision fights as late as 1911 with Welterweight champion William \\"Honey\\" Melody in September and Mike Leonard in May in New York, though these bouts were not confirmed by BoxRec and other boxers used the name Young Griffo. He served time at the Bridewell in Chicago, but was released around 28 November 1910, and returned to New York. He had plans to go on the vaudeville circuit with Charles Griffin, another boxer.\\"Young Griffo Out of Jail\\", Muskogee Times Democrat, Muskogee, Oklahoma, pg. 7, 29 November 1910 In a tribute to Griffo, boxer Tommy Sullivan wrote in the 6 March 1916 Tacoma Daily News: > Not known as much of a puncher, but his skill was uncanny. He had wonderful > head work, almost impenetrable defense, dazzling feints, and rapid two- > handed methods of attack. The cleverest boxers and hardest punchers were > made to look ridiculous when exchanging swats with him. He had a dislike of > training and was deemed lazy. There were times he got drunk before a match > [such as the Ike Weir and Tommy Tracy bouts]. Brief film career He appeared as himself in the 1895 lost short Young Griffo vs. Battling Charles Barnett, which at least one source claims is the first film shown for profit. He appeared in at least two other films. Apparently, two of his film roles were released near or after his death. Released in 1927, he had a minor role in Frank Capra's comedy Long Pants, and the following year in Harry Edwards' 1928 comedy, The Best Man. Tragic life after boxing In March 1912, Griffo requested to be sent to the New York workhouse, partly a victim of alcoholism, which had affected him intermittently throughout his career.\\"John Barleycorn Once Again King\\", Oakland Tribune, Oakland, California, pg. 34, 24 March 1912 On 11 July 1912, he was briefly jailed for \\"almstaking\\" or begging, an arrest that probably would not have been made in more recent times. He had been arrested previously for begging.\\"Young Griffo Again Jailed for Begging\\", Vancouver Daily World, Vancouver, Canada, pg. 12, 11 July 1912 For the last fifteen years of his life he took donations and met friends at the entrance to New York's Rialto Theatre on Broadway and 42nd Street, becoming increasingly destitute by 1925. He spent some of his later years in asylums, and received a portion of his income from benefits staged by his friends.He spent time in asylums, and gained some income from benefits in \\"Young Griffo, Marvel of Antipodes, World's Greatest Boxer\\", Pittsburgh Post, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 28, 11 March 1923 He had gained over fifty pounds by the time of his death. He died in New York of heart disease, initially diagnosed as indigestion, on 7 December 1927 at age 56. He received medical aid too late after dragging himself into a hall from his small rent free room in a West side New York boarding house paid for by Jane F. Fish, an author of children's books.Jane Fish paid his rent in \\"Young Griffo, Former Ring Star,\\" The Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana, pg. 16, 8 December 1927 Many American newspapers ran stories on his life as a tragic tale of the effects of alcohol.

Sergeant Geiger was one of nineteen men who was cited for heroism in obtaining critical water for the wounded. Along with Private Charles Windolph, Blacksmith Henry Mechlin, and Saddler Otto Voit, Sergeant Geiger took up an exposed position outside of the cavalry's line of defense in order to draw enemy fire away from fifteen other men who risked their own lives to get water from the river. For four hours the four valiant troopers, acting as both decoys and an attacking force, dodged bullets and laid down a protective covering fire. They accomplished their mission so well that not one of the men who dashed the eighty yards from the cavalry encampment to the river was killed.

It had 804 pupils between the ages of 11 and 16 years in 2013. The school was awarded Beacon School status in 1998 which was renewed in 2002. In September 2000, Kingsmead gained Language College status. In December 2009 Kingsmead received an Outstanding judgement from Ofsted and Good in 2013. In April 2011, Kingsmead became an Academy. History The original block at Kingsmead was modelled in a late Art Deco style, hence its similarities in appearance to an early 20th century cinema. The main part of the school (including the hall, gymnasium, canteen, science labs, library, cloakrooms and classrooms) was built during the early 1950s, when a rise in the number of children in post- war Britain (also known as the \\"baby boom\\" era) lead to a demand for more schools across the country. The main block was extended at either ends during the 1970s, and during this period a second block (now the Language College) was constructed. A sports hall was built to the rear of the school next to the staff car park during the early 1990s, along with several new offices for senior management near the drama studio. The second most recent significant development is the \\"south block\\", a million pound construction with 7 new classrooms and an ICT room; opened September 2006. The infrastructure of the school was never designed for nearly 800 pupils, so the school relies on the field to the back of the school during the summer months for pupils at break and lunchtime. A new south block opened in 2006. A new science block opened in 2014, and in 2015 received a grant for new building work. Further funding for building work was obtained in 2017. A new main block will replace the old main block that sadly has concrete cancer the new block will be constructed on the place of the tennis courts and the old block will be replaced with a new set of tennis courts there are no confirmed dates for the new build but we are reliably informed it is in the near future this new process is known to some students as R.A.P ops. A mural was added at the entrance to the east block in 2017. And another was added to the school entrance featuring famous and inspirational people such as nelson Mandela Albert Einstein and Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov. A new field block of temporary classrooms have been built over the summer holidays of 2020 this blocks rooms have been described as ‚Äúsmall but nice and modern‚Äù by a notable Kingsmead student this is all in aid of the new main building in place of the tennis courts and old main block they have put up Berlin style walls with which to stop runaway children getting crushed by machinery Zambia fund Since 1999 Kingsmead has upheld a partnership with two schools in the Copperbelt region which is situated in Northern Zambia. First the headteacher from one of the schools in Kitwe came to Somerset and then 8 teachers from Kingsmead went to Zambia. They visited Mukuba Boys School and Helen Kaunda Girls Secondary School. Each year, 12 pupils are selected to take part in the exchange programme. First the Zambian pupils come to Kingsmead and then the British pupils head out to Zambia. Then the following year it is the turn of the teachers. When the British pupils head over they take crates of educational resources. These are filled with books, pencils, pens, paper and other learning essentials. The school has set up the 'Kingsmead International Trust' to help the people of Kitwe in Zambia who are unable to attend school because of AIDS and other problems commonly faced by African people. The trust is a registered charity.

More commonly referred to as the six sisters, they were built for the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company between 1946 & 1955 primarily to replace war-time losses. The company's previous King Orry was one of three company losses during Operation Dynamo - the evacuation of British and French troops from the port of Dunkirk during May 1940. The name King Orry is a corruption of King Gorree, from the Manx Gaelic Ree Gorree, the Manx name for Godred Crovan a Norse-Gael ruler of Dublin, and King of Mann and the Isles in the second half of the 11th century. Construction & dimensions King Orry was built at Cammell Laird, Birkenhead. The cost of the vessel was ¬£402,095. Length 325 feet; beam 47 feet; depth 18 feet( see note), with a registered tonnage of . King Orry was driven by two sets of Parsons turbines with single reduction gearing producing 8,500 brake horsepower. This gave the vessel a design speed of 21 knots. King Orry was certificated to carry 2136 passengers, and had a crew complement of 68. She had a single funnel, a cruiser stern and two pole masts. King Orry was launched on 22 November 1945, and acquired by Isle of Man Steam Packet Company on 16 April 1946. She made her maiden voyage on 19 April, and completed 29 years service. Note: the information on All the Six Sisters lists draught As 18 feet. This is actually the depth( the distance from main deck to keel) the draught was around 12/13 feet i.e. the depth of water required to float. This can be clearly seen on bow and stern as the draught in feet is marked in white numbers. The white line separating the red painted lower hull from the black painted portion has the number 16 on it at the bow and 14 at the stern.

King Orry was the first company vessel to adopt the system of prior booking for private cabins, which was considered to be a splendid innovation. Due to a rationalisation of company routes following problems with the berth at Fleetwood, her younger sister was disposed of in 1962. King Orry Officers, Deck Crew, Engineering Staff and Catering Staff, circa 1973. King Orry was considered a reliable and efficient ship, her most noteworthy episode during her service occurred in 1953, when a great storm sank the Princess Victoria in the North Channel. While that tragedy was in progress, King Orry was one of the only ships at sea and although late, reached Douglas safely under the command of Captain Bridson. With the introduction into service of the company's third car ferry, in 1972, time was beginning to catch up with the King Orry. King Orry made her final crossing from Douglas on Saturday, 30 August 1975; to the traditional farwell from her sister's ship's whistles, at 15:00hrs. On Bank Holiday Monday, 31 August 1975, King Orry carried her last passengers from Llandudno to Liverpool. Disposal King Orry was bought by R. Taylor and Son of Bury for breaking up, and was taken to Glasson Dock to await her fate. She was berthed alongside for more than two months and there were rumours that she might be resold to Greek interests. However, during a severe storm on the night of Friday, 2 January 1976, whilst laid-up at Glasson Dock on the lower estuary, King Orry broke away from her berth and drifted aground in the Lune Estuary, coming to rest on the mud flats. A great deal of energy was spent trying to re-float her, until she was finally re-floated on 15 April 1976. Lynch and Son of Rochester, Kent broke her up in 1979. King Orry's name was destined to survive. The breakers were approached by officials from the National Maritime Museum who purchased her starboard turbines, auxiliary machinery, a propeller and one of her three boilers. These were regarded as typical of the machinery used in the 1940s on cross-channel ships. On purchase the items were put into storage at Chatham Dockyard, the intention being to put them on display later at Greenwich. Subsequently, this occurred, and further information regarding her machinery arrangement and specifications were supplied by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company.

The EuroCity train EC 108 Comenius was an express train en route from Krak√≥w, Poland to Prague, Czech Republic that struck a part of a motorway bridge that had fallen onto the railroad track near Stud√©nka railway station in the Czech Republic. The train derailed and eight people were killed with 64 others injured.  The crash  The motorway bridge near Stud√©nka railroad station was undergoing repairs that were to last until September 2008. On 8 August the workers were putting a beam to span between the two supports on the sides of the railroad track. Parts of the beam fell onto the track when the train was away, approaching the bridge at around . The driver noticed the iron bridge structure swaying and immediately engaged the emergency brake and escaped from the control cab to the engine room, which is much better protected against impact. This behaviour was later recognized by the Czech Railways inspectors as exactly what drivers should do in this kind of situation. It was said that there is a very high probability that this conduct saved his life. The train struck the obstacle within just a few seconds, by which time the train had slowed to . The locomotive and four carriages derailed after the impact; the carriage coupled directly behind the locomotive sustained the most damage. Six other carriages, among them the restaurant carriage, remained on the track. Three freight vans on another track were also derailed. At the time of the accident, there were approximately 400 people on board the train, 105 of them of Polish nationality. There was also a group of people travelling to an Iron Maiden concert in Prague.  Rescue operation  thumb Since the accident happened during the day and there were people present in the proximity of the track, the rescue units were notified about the situation almost instantly. The first rescue unit, which consisted of firefighters stationed in Stud√©nka, arrived at the accident site only seven minutes after the alarm was issued. There were a total of 20 firefighter rescue units (altogether 100 firefighters and 40 firefighter engines) rescuing the passengers. Twenty ambulances together with helicopters transported the injured into all the nearest hospitals in Ostrava, Nov√Ω Jiƒç√≠n, Fr√Ωdek-M√≠stek, Opava, B√≠lovec, Olomouc and Vala≈°sk√© Mezi≈ô√≠ƒç√≠. Thanks to cooperation within the Integrated rescue system (Integrovan√Ω z√°chrann√Ω syst√©m), all the injured were in the hospitals within two hours of the accident. Polish authorities offered help with the rescue operation immediately when notified about the disaster, but the offer was not accepted as Czech rescue services did not consider it necessary.  Criticism  Immediately after the accident there was a great public uproar about finding the culprits. First accused was the Czech Railways company for letting trains travel at relatively high speeds in the construction area. However, the Czech Railways spokesman stated that the building company had not notified the Czech Railways about the ongoing reconstruction of the bridge. The building company Dopravn√≠ stavby Ostrava was also accused of being responsible for the accident. The spokesman for the company stated that the causes of the falling bridge parts onto the track were being investigated and that all the compulsory notifications to the Czech Railways about the reconstruction of the bridge had definitely been issued.  Aftermath  Two Czech men, three Czech women and a Polish woman were killed in the crash, while the seventh victim, a young Ukrainian man, died later in hospital. The eighth fatality, a 21-year- old Polish woman, died two months after the disaster on 26 September. The cost of the damage was estimated at 136 million CZK (5.6 million Euros, 8.4 million US dollars), according to a Czech Rail Safety Inspection Office announcement. The Czech Railways company promised to pay compensation to everyone injured as well as to families of the dead. The amount of money paid would then vary depending on individual circumstances of every case.

The Soviet head of atomic research Igor Kurchatov monitors the American progress through Fuchs. Following Nazi surrender Fuchs fears the weapon will be used against the USSR. Fuchs passes the details of the plutonium bomb, Fatman, to his Soviet contact, Raymond. The project's tests are successful and the uranium bomb, Little Boy, is dropped on Hiroshima while Piles and Fuchs's Fatman is dropped on Nagasaki. In the aftermath Soviet premier Joseph Stalin orders Lavrentiy Beria to construct a Soviet plutonium bomb based on the Fatman plans supplied by Fuchs. Recalled to England, his adopted home, Fuchs returns with the nuclear secrets the U.S. is no longer willing to share. Fuchs passes the American secrets to the British as well. Fuchs begins to doubt Stalin's actions and decides to stop spying for Soviets, but it is too late as the Soviet Union detonates Joe 1. FBI agent Robert Lamphere identifies Fuchs from decoded Soviet signals and MI5 commence surveillance. British security officer Henry Arnold coaxes a confession out of Fuchs who admits to having spied for the Soviets since 1941. Fuchs was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 14 years in prison. =Cast= { width=\\"100%\\"   valign=\\"top\\" width=50%  *Marco Hofschneider as Klaus Fuchs *Jonathan Firth as Rudolf Peierls *Shane Dean as Captain De Silva *Christina Catalina as Young Kristal *Joe Jones as Robert Oppenheimer *Mark Lawler as Edward Teller *Lucy Gaskell as Genia Peierls *Ross Collins as George Kistiakowsky *Kristin Atwell as Kristal  valign=\\"top\\" width=50%  *Gene Ganssle as Harry Gold *Gergo Danka as Igor Kurchatov *Slade Hall as Stanislaw Ulam *Shannon Whirry as Kitty Oppenheimer *Gerrard McArthur as Henry Arnold *Breffni McKenna as Alexander Feklisov *Noah Lee Margetts as Robert Lamphere *David Barrass as Seymon Kremmer *Martina Maria Reichart as Sonia } Episode three: Superbomb In 1950, Edward Teller briefs the team at Los Alamos about plans to construct a hydrogen bomb but U.S. Presidential Advisor Robert Oppenheimer opposes him. Oppenheimer is summoned to the White House to discuss whether Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs passed on info about the Super. Soviet Chairman Stalin instructs Andrei Sakharov to work under Beria on the Soviet hydrogen bomb project. U.S. Atomic Energy Commissioner Lewis Strauss supports Teller and U.S. President Harry S. Truman commissions the project. Kitty Oppenheimer fears her communist connections may compromise her husband and his moral objections to the project. Sakharov reviews Fuchs' info on Teller's Super but has his own plans for a simpler but less powerful bomb. Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Robert Lamphere gets Fuchs to confirm his contact was Harry Gold and this leads to the arrest of the Rosenbergs. Teller and Stanislaw Ulam find an ingenious solution to the problems with their design, which is successfully tested following Teller's resignation from the project. A power struggle in the USSR following the death of Stalin results in the downfall of Beria shortly before the testing of the Soviet H-bomb. Strauss orders the FBI to revoke Oppenheimer's security clearance under suspicion of spying for the Soviets. When U.S. testing runs out of control the American public are alerted to the power of this new weapon. Teller testifies against Oppenheimer at a security hearing and Strauss's objections are upheld.

In 1986 he reveals to journalists Oscar Guerrero and Peter Hounam the presence of an underground plutonium plant there. Former Israeli Prime Minister David Ben- Gurion had commissioned construction of the plant in 1958. Vanunu had made the discovery after 7-years at the plant and had photos to prove his story. Hounam takes Vanunu to The Sunday Times in London, where Nuclear Physicist Frank Barnaby confirms the data, but the Mossad is tailing them. Guerrero arrives in London and tries to sell the story to rival paper The Sunday Mirror. France, Britain and the U.S. had been complicit in the construction under a secret agreement between U.S. President Richard Nixon and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. The lonely Vanunu befriends intern Wendy Robbins but she insists that they remain just friends. The discredited story in the Mirror causes the Times to delay their publication. Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres forbids the Mossad from kidnapping Vanunu on British soil so they spring a honey trap to lure him to Rome. In Italy Vanunu is abducted and shipped back to Israel but the Times decides to publish in the hopes of protecting his life. The Western powers that had professed a stance of non-nuclear proliferation while collaborating in the construction of Dimona were exposed as hypocrites and yet the press in those countries remained curiously silent on the subject. The Israelis confirm that they have Vanunu in detention but refuses to explain how. Convicted of treason Vanunu was sentenced to 18 years in prison. { width=\\"100%\\"   valign=\\"top\\" width=50%  =Cast= *Ren√© Zagger as Mordechai Vanunu *Nick Moran as Oscar Guerrero *Celia Meiras as Wendy Robbins *Lucia Giannecchini as Cindy Hanin *Mark Ross as Peter Hounam *Tom Price as Max Prangnell *Fred Pearson as Frank Barnaby  valign=\\"top\\" width=50%  =Contributors= *Prof. Frank Barnaby ‚Äì Nuclear Physicist *Prof. Avner Cohen ‚Äì Author Israel and the Bomb *Peter Hounam ‚Äì Ex Insight Journalist *Joseph Tommy Lapid ‚Äì Former Israeli Justice Minister *Robin Morgan ‚Äì Ex Editor, Insight *Max Prangnell ‚Äì Ex Insight Journalist *Wendy Robbins ‚Äì Ex Sunday Times Intern } Episode five: The Terror Trader Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan started working for URENCO in The Netherlands in 1972. working for the Pakistani Government, Khan gained access to technology due to lax security methods. Returning to Pakistan with his family in 1975. Khan's family had left for Pakistan following the end of 1971 Indo-Pakistan War. Khan had become a fierce nationalist. Pakistan's President Bhutto supported Khan and he constructed a nuclear plant in the foothills of the Himalayas. Dutch enquiries in the 1980s finally revealed what Khan was doing but he gets off on a technicality. The U.S. overlooks Khan's program in order to gain Pakistani support against the USSR in Afghanistan. Khan acquires missile technology from China and extends his network into the Middle East. UN Weapons Inspectors in Iraq uncover documents implicating Khan in nuclear trading but the West fails to act. Khan continues his trade amassing a huge personal fortune and becomes a hero following the detonation of Pakistan's first bomb. A joint CIA/MI6 task force uncovers Khan's dealings with Libya but are unable to move as Pakistani support is again needed in the post-9/11 Invasion of Afghanistan. UN Weapons Inspectors in Iran uncover further evidence implicating Khan, which the Iranians confirm. The task force targets Khan's network with a double agent and intercept a shipment of centrifuges to Libya. Muammar al-Gaddafi agrees to cooperate with UN Weapons Inspectors and the full extent of Khan's capabilities are revealed. Khan's deputy Tehir is arrested and interrogated in Malaysia and confesses.

The most prominent event in the Late Pleistocene is differentiated from previous Quaternary pulse extinctions by the widespread absence of ecological succession to replace these extinct species, and the regime shift of previously established faunal relationships and habitats as a consequence. The earliest casualties were incurred at 130,000 BCE (the start of the Late Pleistocene). However, the great majority of extinctions in Afro-Eurasia and the Americas occurred during the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene epoch (13,000 BCE to 8,000 BCE). This extinction wave did not stop at the end of the Pleistocene, continuing, especially on isolated islands, in human-caused extinctions, although there is debate as to whether these should be considered separate events or part of the same event. Among the main causes hypothesized by paleontologists are overkill by the widespread appearance of humans and natural climate change. A notable modern human presence first appeared during the Middle Pleistocene in Africa, and started to establish continuous, permanent populations in Eurasia and Australasia from 120,000 BCE and 63,000 BCE respectively, and the Americas from 22,000 BCE. A variant of the former possibility is the second-order predation hypothesis, which focuses more on the indirect damage caused by overcompetition with nonhuman predators. Recent studies have tended to favor the human-overkill theory.Extinctions in Near Time. Pages 46‚Äì47. By R. D. E. MacPhee. Springer Press. 1999.

The Late Pleistocene extinction event saw the extinction of many mammals weighing more than 40 kg. The proportional rate of megafauna extinctions is progressively larger the greater the human migratory distance from Africa. The extinctions in the Americas entailed the elimination of all the larger (over 100 kg) mammalian species of South American origin, including those that had migrated north in the Great American Interchange. Only in the continents of Australia, North America, and South America did the extinction occur at family taxonomic levels or higher. The proportional rate of megafauna extinctions being incrementally bigger the larger the migratory distance from Africa might be related to non-African megafauna and Homo sapiens not having evolved as species alongside each other. For their part, Australia, North America and South America, which respectively had the highest incremental extinction rates, had no known native species of Hominoidea (apes) at all, and specifically no species of Hominidae (greater apes) or Homo. The increased rate of extinction mirrors the sequential pattern of the migration of anatomically modern humans. The further away from Africa, the more recently the area has been inhabited by humans, and the less time the environments (including its megafauna) had had to become accustomed to humans and vice versa. There is no evidence of megafaunal extinctions at the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, which lends itself to the hypothesis that increasing cold and glaciation were not factors regarding the Pleistocene extinction. There are three main hypotheses concerning the Pleistocene extinction: * climate change associated with the advance and retreat of major ice caps or ice sheets. * \\"prehistoric overkill hypothesis\\" * the extinction of the woolly mammoth changed the extensive grassland to birch forest, and subsequent forest fires then changed the climate. We now know that immediately after the extinction of the mammoth, birch forest replaced the grassland and that an era of significant fire began. There are some inconsistencies between the current available data and the prehistoric overkill hypothesis. For instance, there are ambiguities around the timing of sudden extinctions of Australian megafauna. Biologists note that comparable extinctions have not occurred in Africa and South or Southeast Asia, where the fauna evolved with hominids. Post-glacial megafaunal extinctions in Africa have been spaced over a longer interval. Evidence supporting the prehistoric overkill hypothesis includes the persistence of certain island megafauna for several millennia past the disappearance of their continental cousins. Ground sloths survived on the Antilles long after North and South American ground sloths were extinct. The later disappearance of the island species correlates with the later colonization of these islands by humans. Similarly, woolly mammoths died out on remote Wrangel Island 1,000 years after their extinction on the mainland. Steller's sea cows also persisted in seas off the isolated and uninhabited Commander Islands for thousands of years after they had vanished from the continental shores of the north Pacific. Alternative hypotheses to the theory of human responsibility include climate change associated with the last glacial period and the Younger Dryas event, as well as Tollmann's hypothetical bolide, which claim that the extinctions resulted from bolide impacts. Such a scenario has been proposed as a contributing cause of the 1,300-year cold period known as the Younger Dryas stadial. This impact extinction hypothesis is still in debate due to the exacting field techniques required to extract minuscule particles of extraterrestrial impact markers such as iridium at a high resolution from very thin strata in a repeatable fashion, as is necessary to conclusively distinguish the event peak from the local background level of the marker. The debate seems to be exacerbated by infighting between the Uniformitarianism camp and the Catastrophism camp. Recent research indicates that each single species responded differently to environmental changes, and that one factor by itself cannot explain the large number of extinctions. The causes are complex, and may involve elements of climate change, interspecific competition, unstable population dynamics, and human predation.

Sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia are the only regions that have terrestrial mammals weighing over 1000 kg today. However, there are indications of megafaunal extinction events throughout the Pleistocene, particularly in Africa two million years ago, which coincide with key stages of human evolution and climatic trends. The center of human evolution and expansion, Africa and Asia were inhabited by advanced hominids by 2mya, with Homo habilis in Africa, and Homo erectus on both continents. By the advent and proliferation of Homo sapiens circa 315,000 BCE, dominant species included Homo heidelbergensis in Africa, the denisovans and neanderthals (fellow H. heidelbergensis descendants) in Eurasia, and Homo erectus in Eastern Asia. Ultimately, on both continents, these groups and other populations of Homo were subsumed by successive radiations of H. sapiens. There is evidence of an early migration event 268,000 BCE and later within neanderthal genetics, however the earliest dating for H. sapiens inhabitation is 118,000 BCE in Arabia, China and Israel, and 71,000 BCE in Indonesia. Additionally, not only have these early Asian migrations left a genetic mark on modern Papuan populations, the oldest known pottery in existence was found in China, dated to 18,000 BCE. Particularly during the late Pleistocene, megafaunal diversity was notably reduced from both these continents, often without being replaced by comparable successor fauna. Climate change has been explored as a prominent cause of extinctions in Southeast Asia. =Afrotropic and Indomalaya Late Pleistocene & Holocene= * Several Bovidae spp. ** Indian aurochs (Bos (primigenius) namadicus) ** Bos palaesondaicus ** Leptobison hanaizumiensis ** Cebu tamaraw (Bubalus cebuensis) ** Bubalus grovesi ** Giant long-horned buffalo (Pelorovis) ** Megalovis ** Naemorhedus sumatraensis ** Giant hartebeest (Megalotragus) ** Hippotragus spp. *** Hippotragus gigas ** Rusingoryx ** Sivacobus sankaliai ** Various Gazella spp. * Sinomegaceros * Megaceroides algericus * Sivatherium maurusium * Dorcabune * Hippopotamus spp. ** Hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius; extirpated in western Asia circa 1,000 BCE) ** All Malagasy hippopotamus spp. *** Hippopotamus lemerlei *** Hippopotamus madagascariensis *** Hippopotamus laloumena * Hexaprotodon * Wild Equus spp. ** Equus capensis ** Equus mauritanicus ** Equus namadicus ** Equus sivalensis ** Equus yunannensis * Several Rhinoceros (Rhinocerotidae) spp. ** Ceratotherium mauritanicum ** Rhinoceros philippinensis ** Rhinoceros sinensis ** South Asian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sivalensis) * Giant tapir (Tapirus augustus) * Various Felidae spp. ** Sivapanthera ** Sri Lanka lion (Panthera leo sinhaleyus) ** Leopard (Panthera pardus; extirpated from Japan and Sumatra) ** Tiger (Panthera tigris; extirpated from Japan, Borneo and Palawan) * Ailuropoda baconi (ancestor to the giant panda) * Aardvark (Orycteropus afer; extirpated in South Asia circa 13,000 BCE) * Stegodon * Elephas spp. ** Elephas hysudricus ** Elephas hysudrindicus ** Elephas maximus rubridens * Palaeoloxodon spp. ** Palaeoloxodon namadicus (largest land mammal on record) ** Palaeoloxodon naumanni ** Palaeoloxodon recki ** Paleoloxodon turkmenicus * Loxodonta atlantica * Coryphomys * Verhoeven's giant tree rat (Papagomys theodorverhoeveni) * Asian ostrich (Struthio asiaticus) * Japanese flightless duck (Shiriyanetta hasegawai) * Bennu heron (Ardea bennuides) * Leptoptilos robustus * Megalochelys atlas (largest recorded giant tortoise in existence) * Hipposideros besaoka * Giant fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea) * Microgale macpheei * Plesiorycteropus (aardvark-like mammals endemic to Madagascar) * Giant members of lemur (Lemuroidea) ** Giant aye-aye (Daubentonia robusta) ** Pachylemur ** Koala lemur (Megaladapis) ** All monkey lemur (Archaeolemuridae) spp. *** Hadropithecus *** Archaeolemur ** All sloth lemur (Palaeopropithecidae) spp. *** Archaeoindris (largest lemur on record) *** Palaeopropithecus *** Babakotia *** Mesopropithecus * All members of elephant bird (Aepyornithidae) ** Aepyornis ** Mullerornis ** Vorombe titan (largest bird on record) * Malagasy sheldgoose (Centrornis) * Malagasy shelduck (Alopochen sirabensis) * Hova gallinule (Hovacrex roberti) * Malagasy lapwing (Vanellus madagascariensis) * Malagasy crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus maher) * Ampoza ground roller (Brachypteracias langrandi) * Voay * Various Aldabrachelys giant tortoise ** Aldabrachelys abrupta ** Aldabrachelys grandidieri * Aldabrachampsus * Canariomys * Canary Islands quail (Coturnix gomerae) * Long-legged bunting (Emberiza alcoveri) * Centrochelys * Gallotia goliath * Several monkey (Simiiformes) spp. **Macaca spp. *** Macaca anderssoni *** Macaca jiangchuanensis *** Robust macaque (Macaca robustus) ** Gorgopithecus ** Pongo hooijeri ** Various Homo spp. ***Archaic African hominins (undescribed) *** Homo erectus *** Homo floresiensis *** Homo luzonensis *** Denisovans (Homo sp.) *** Neanderthals (Homo (sapiens) neanderthalensis) *** Red Deer Cave people (Homo sp.) *** Unknown Asiatic hominins (Homo sp.) *** Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis) Palearctic: Europe and northern Asia Saiga antelope (Saiga spp.) inhabited a range from England and France to Yukon in the Late Pleistocene, diversifying into two species.

The Palearctic realm spans the entirety of the European continent and stretches into northern Asia, through the Caucasus and central Asia to northern China, Siberia and Beringia. During the Late Pleistocene, this region was noted for its great diversity and dynamism of biomes, including the warm climes of the Mediterranean basin, open temperate woodlands, arid plains, mountainous heathland and swampy wetlands, all of which were vulnerable to the severe climatic fluctuations of the interchanges between glacial and interglacials periods (stadials). However, it was the expansive mammoth steppe which was the ecosystem which united and defined this region during the Late Pleistocene. One of the key features of Europe's Late Pleistocene climate was the often drastic turnover of conditions and biota between the numerous stadials, which could set within a century. For example, during glacial periods, the entire North Sea was drained of water to form Doggerland. The final major cold spell occurred from 25,000 BCE to 18,000 BCE and is known as the Last Glacial Maximum, when the Fenno-Scandinavian ice sheet covered much of northern Europe, while the Alpine ice sheet occupied significant parts of central-southern Europe. Europe and northern Asia, being far colder and drier than today, was largely hegemonized by the mammoth steppe, an ecosystem dominated by palatable high-productivity grasses, herbs and willow shrubs. This supported an extensive biota of grassland fauna and stretched eastwards from Spain in the Iberian Peninsula to Yukon in modern-day Canada. The area was populated by many species of grazers which assembled in large herds similar in size to those in Africa today. Populous species which roamed the great grasslands included the woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, Elasmotherium, steppe bison, Pleistocene horse, muskox, Cervalces, reindeer, various antelopes (goat-horned antelope, mongolian gazelle, saiga antelope and twisted-horned antelope) and steppe pika. Carnivores included Eurasian cave lion, scimitar cat, cave hyena, grey wolf, dhole and the Arctic fox. At the edges of these large stretches of grassland could be found more shrub-like terrain and dry conifer forest and woodland (akin to forest steppe or taiga). The browsing collective of megafauna included woolly rhinoceros, giant deer, moose, Cervalces, tarpan, aurochs, woodland bison, camels and smaller deer (Siberian roe deer, red deer and Siberian musk deer). Brown bears, wolverines, cave bear, wolves, lynx, leopards and red foxes also inhabited this biome. Tigers were at stages also present, from the edges of eastern Europe around the Black Sea to Beringia. The more mountainous terrain, incorporating montane grassland, subalpine conifer forest, alpine tundra and broken, craggy slopes, was occupied by several species of mountain-going animals like argali, chamois, ibex, mouflon, pika, wolves, leopards, Ursus spp. and lynx, with snow leopards, Baikal yak and snow sheep in northern Asia. Arctic tundra, which lined the north of the mammoth steppe, reflected modern ecology with species such as the polar bear, wolf, reindeer and muskox. Other biomes, although less noted, were significant in contributing to the diversity of fauna in Late Pleistocene Europe. Warmer grasslands such as temperate steppe and Mediterranean savannah hosted Stephanorhinus, gazelle, European bison, Asian ostriches, Leptobos, cheetah and onager. These biomes also contained an assortment of mammoth steppe fauna, such as saiga antelope, lions, scimitar cats, cave hyenas, wolves, Pleistocene horse, steppe bison, twisted-horned antelope, aurochs and camels. Temperate coniferous, deciduous, mixed broadleaf and Mediterranean forest and open woodland accommodated straight-tusked elephants, Praemegaceros, Stephanorhinus, wild boar, bovids such as European bison, tahr and tur, species of Ursus such as the Etruscan bear and smaller deer (Roe deer, red deer, fallow deer and Mediterranean deer) with several mammoth steppe species such as lynx, tarpan, wolves, dholes, moose, giant deer, woodland bison, leopards and aurochs. Woolly rhinoceros and mammoth occasionally resided in these temperate biomes, mixing with predominately temperate fauna to escape harsh glacials. In warmer wetlands, European water buffalo and hippopotamus were present. Although these habitats were restricted to micro refugia and to southern Europe and its fringes, being in Iberia, Italy, the Balkans, Ukraine's Black Sea basin, the Caucasus and western Asia, during inter-glacials these biomes had a far more northernly range. For example, hippopotamus inhabited Great Britain and straight-tusked elephant the Netherlands, as recently as 80,000 BCE and 42,000 BCE respectively. The first possible indications of habitation by hominins are the 7.2 million year old finds of Graecopithecus, and 5.7 million year old footprints in Crete ‚Äî however established habitation is noted in Georgia from 1.8 million years ago, proceeded to Germany and France, by Homo erectus. Prominent co-current and subsequent species include Homo antecessor, Homo cepranensis, Homo heidelbergensis, neanderthals and denisovans, preceding habitation by Homo sapiens circa 38,000 BCE. Extensive contact between African and Eurasian Homo groups is known at least in part through transfers of stone-tool technology in 500,000 BCE and again at 250,000 BCE. Europe's Late Pleistocene biota went through two phases of extinction. Some fauna became extinct before 13,000 BCE, in staggered intervals, particularly between 50,000 BCE and 30,000 BCE. Species include cave bear, Elasmotherium, straight-tusked elephant, Stephanorhinus, water buffalo, neanderthals, gazelle and scimitar cat. However, the great majority of species were extinguished, extirpated or experienced severe population contractions between 13,000 BCE and 9,000 BCE,See Figure 1 in ending with the Younger Dryas. At that time there were small ice sheets in Scotland and Scandinavia. The mammoth steppe disappeared from the vast majority of its former range, either due to a permanent shift in climatic conditions, or an absence of ecosystem management due to decimated, fragmented or extinct populations of megaherbivores. This led to a region wide extinction vortex, resulting in cyclically diminishing bio-productivity and defaunation. Insular species on Mediterranean islands such as Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, Cyprus and Crete, went extinct around the same time as humans colonised those islands. Fauna included dwarf elephants, megacerines and hippopotamuses, and giant avians, otters and rodents. * Various Bovidae spp. **Steppe bison (Bison priscus) ** Pleistocene woodland bison (Bison (bonasus) schoetensacki) ** Baikal yak (Bos baikalensis) ** European water buffalo (Bubalus murrensis) ** Leptobos spp. ** European tahr (Hemitragus cedrensis) ** Giant muskox (Praeovibos priscus) ** Balearic Islands cave goat (Myotragus balearicus) ** Northern saiga antelope (Saiga borealis) ** Twisted-horned antelope (Spirocerus kiakhtensis) ** Goat-horned antelope (Parabubalis capricornis) ** Gazella spp. * Various deer (Cervidae) spp. ** Broad-fronted moose (Cervalces latifrons) ** Giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus) ** Praemegaceros ** Cretan dwarf megacerine (Candiacervus) ** Mediterranean deer (Haploidoceros mediterraneus) ** Palmated red deer (Cervus elaphus acoronatus) * All native Hippopotamus spp. ** European hippopotamus (Hippopotamus antiquus) ** Maltese dwarf hippopotamus (Hippopotamus melitensis) ** Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus (Hippopotamus minor) ** Sicilian dwarf hippopotamus (Hippopotamus pentlandi) * Camelus knoblochi and other Camelus spp. * Various Equus spp. e.g. ** Wild horse (Equus ferus ssp.) ** Equus cf. gallicus ** European Ass (Equus hydruntinus) ** Equus cf. latipes ** Equus cf. lenensis ** Equus cf. uralensis * All native Rhinoceros (Rhinocerotidae) spp. ** Elasmotherium ** Woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) ** Stephanorhinus spp. *** Merck's rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis) *** Narrow-nosed rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus hemiotoechus) * Various Felidae spp. ** Scimitar cat (Homotherium) ** Mediterranean cave lynx (Lynx spelaeus) ** Lynx issiodorensis ** Panthera spp. *** Cave lion (Panthera spelaea) *** European ice age leopard (Panthera pardus spelaea) * Cave hyena (Crocuta crocuta spelaea) * European dhole (Cuon alpinus europaeus) * Sardinian dhole (Cynotherium sardous) * Several otter (Lutrinae) spp. ** Robust Pleistocene European otter (Cyrnaonyx) ** Pleistocene Mediterranean otter (Algarolutra) ** Sardinian giant otter (Megalenhydris barbaricina) ** Sardinian dwarf otter (Sardolutra) ** Cretan otter (Lutrogale cretensis) * Various Ursus spp. ** Deninger's bear (Ursus deningeri) ** Etruscan bear (Ursus etruscus) ** Gamssulzen cave bear (Ursus ingressus) ** Pleistocene small cave bear (Ursus rossicus) ** Cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) ** Giant polar bear (Ursus maritimus tyrannus) * All native Elephant (Elephantidae) spp. ** Woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) ** Dwarf mammoth *** Cretan dwarf mammoth (Mammuthus creticus) *** Dwarf Sardinian mammoth (Mammuthus lamarmorai) ** Straight- tusked elephant (Palaeoloxodon antiquus) ** Dwarf elephant *** Palaeoloxodon chaniensis *** Cyprus dwarf elephant (Palaeoloxodon cypriotes) *** Pygmy elephant (Palaeoloxodon falconeri) *** Palaeoloxodon mnaidriensis * Balearic giant dormouse (Hypnomys) spp. e.g. ** Majorcan giant dormouse (Hypnomys morpheus) * Leithia spp. (Maltese and Sicilian giant dormouse) * Pika (Ochotona) spp. e.g. ** Giant pika (Ochotona whartoni) * Asian ostrich (Struthio asiaticus) * Giant swan (Cygnus falconeri) * Yakutian goose (Anser djuktaiensis) * Various European crane spp. (Genus Grus) ** Grus primigenia ** Grus melitensis * Cretan owl (Athene cretensis) * Denisovans (Homo sp.) * Neanderthals (Homo (sapiens) neanderthalensis; survived until about 40,000 years ago on the Iberian peninsula) Many species extant today were present in areas either far to the south or west of their contemporary ranges- for example, all the arctic fauna on this list inhabited regions as south as the Iberian Peninsula at various stages of the Late Pleistocene.

Of these, many genera extinctions can be reliably attributed to a brief interval of 11,500 to 10,000 radiocarbon years before present, shortly following the arrival of the Clovis people in North America . Prominent paleontological sites include MexicoArroyo-et-al-2008 and Panama, the crossroads of the American Interchange.Pearson 2005 Most other extinctions are poorly constrained in time, though some definitely occurred outside of this narrow interval. In contrast, only about half a dozen small mammals disappeared during this time. Previous North American extinction pulses had occurred at the end of glaciations, but not with such an ecological imbalance between large mammals and small ones (Moreover, previous extinction pulses were not comparable to the Quaternary extinction event; they involved primarily species replacements within ecological niches, while the latter event resulted in many ecological niches being left unoccupied). Such include the last native North American terror bird (Titanis), rhinoceros (Aphelops) and hyena (Chasmaporthetes). Human habitation commenced unequivocally approximately 22,000 BCE north of the glacier, and 13,500 BCE south, however disputed evidence of southern human habitation exists from 130,000 BCE and 17,000 BCE onwards, described from sites in California and Meadowcroft in Pennsylvania.

All save the pronghorns and giant anteaters were descended from Asian ancestors that had evolved with human predators. Pronghorns are the second-fastest land mammal (after the cheetah), which may have helped them elude hunters. More difficult to explain in the context of overkill is the survival of bison, since these animals first appeared in North America less than 240,000 years ago and so were geographically removed from human predators for a sizeable period of time. Because ancient bison evolved into living bison, there was no continent-wide extinction of bison at the end of the Pleistocene (although the genus was regionally extirpated in many areas). The survival of bison into the Holocene and recent times is therefore inconsistent with the overkill scenario. By the end of the Pleistocene, when humans first entered North America, these large animals had been geographically separated from intensive human hunting for more than 200,000 years. Given this enormous span of geologic time, bison would almost certainly have been very nearly as naive as native North American large mammals. The culture that has been connected with the wave of extinctions in North America is the paleo-American culture associated with the Clovis people (q.v.), who were thought to use spear throwers to kill large animals. The chief criticism of the \\"prehistoric overkill hypothesis\\" has been that the human population at the time was too small and/or not sufficiently widespread geographically to have been capable of such ecologically significant impacts. This criticism does not mean that climate change scenarios explaining the extinction are automatically to be preferred by default, however, any more than weaknesses in climate change arguments can be taken as supporting overkill. Some form of a combination of both factors could be plausible, and overkill would be a lot easier to achieve large-scale extinction with an already dying population due to climate change. Lack of tameable megafauna was perhaps one of the reasons why Amerindian civilizations evolved differently from Old World ones. Critics have disputed this by arguing that llamas, alpacas, and bison were domesticated.

Panochthus frenzelianus with metal model. phorusrhacid in Uruguay are similar in size to the above Pliocene age Procariama simplex. The Neotropical realm was affected by the fact that South America had been isolated as an island continent for many millions of years, and had a wide range of fauna found nowhere else, although many of them became extinct during the Great American Interchange about 3 million years ago, such as the Sparassodonta family. Those that survived the interchange included the ground sloths, glyptodonts, litopterns, pampatheres, phorusrhacids (terror birds) and notoungulates; all managed to extend their range to North America. [3] In the Pleistocene, South America remained largely unglaciated except for increased mountain glaciation in the Andes, which had a two-fold effect- there was a faunal divide between the Andes, and the colder, arid interior resulted in the advance of temperate lowland woodland, tropical savanna and desert at the expense of rainforest. Within these open environments, megafauna diversity was extremely dense, with over 40 genera recorded from the Guerrero member of Luj√°n Formation alone. Ultimately, by the mid-Holocene, all the preeminent genera of megafauna became extinct- the last specimens of Doedicurus and Toxodon have been dated to 4,555 BCE and 3,000 BCE respectively. Their smaller relatives remain, including anteaters, tree sloths, armadillos; New World marsupials: opossums, shrew opossums, and the monito del monte (actually more related to Australian marsupials). Intense human habitation was established circa 11,000 BCE, however partly disputed evidence of pre-clovis habitation occurs since 46,000 BCE and 20,000 BCE, such as at the Serra da Capivara National Park (Brazil) and Monte Verde (Chile) sites. Today the largest land mammals remaining in South America are the wild camels of the Lamini group, such as the guanacos and vicu√±as, and the genus Tapirus, of which Baird's tapir can reach up to 400 kg. Other notable surviving large fauna are peccaries, marsh deer (Capreolinae), giant anteaters, spectacled bears, maned wolves, pumas, ocelots, jaguars, rheas, emerald tree boas, boa constrictors, anacondas, American crocodiles, caimans, and giant rodents such as capybaras. * Several Cervidae spp. ** Morenelaphus ** Antifer ** Agalmaceros blicki ** Odocoileus salinae * Various Camelidae spp. ** Eulamaops ** Stilt legged llama Hemiauchenia ** Stout legged llama Palaeolama * All Pleistocene wild horse genera (Equidae) ** Equus (Amerhippus) *** Equus andium *** Equus insulatus *** Equus neogeus ** Hippidion (Onohippidium) *** Hippidion devillei *** Hippidion principale *** Hippidion saldiasi * All remaining Meridiungulata genera ** Litopterna spp. *** Macrauchenia *** Macraucheniopsis *** Proterotheriidae spp. e.g. **** (Neolicaphrium recens) *** Xenorhinotherium ** Notoungulata spp. *** Hegetotheriidae spp. *** Mesotheriidae spp. *** Mixotoxodon *** Toxodon * Several Felidae spp. ** Saber-toothed cat (Smilodon) spp. *** Smilodon fatalis *** Smilodon populator ** Pleistocene South American jaguar (Panthera onca mesembrina) * Dire wolf (Canis dirus) * Nehring's wolf (Canis nehringi) * Protocyon spp. ** Protocyon trogolodytes ** Protocyon tarijense * Dusicyon avus * Pleistocene bush dog (Speothos pacivorus) * South American short-faced bear (Arctotherium spp.) ** Arctotherium bonairense ** Arctotherium tarijense ** Arctotherium wingei * Giant vampire bat (Desmodus draculae) * All remaining Gomphotheridae spp. ** Cuvieronius ** Notiomastodon/Haplomastodon * Neochoerus * All remaining ground sloth genera ** Megatheriidae spp. *** Eremotherium *** Megatherium ** Nothrotheriidae spp. *** Nothropus *** Nothrotherium ** Megalonychidae spp. *** Ahytherium *** Australonyx *** Diabolotherium *** Megistonyx *** Proplatyarthrus *** Valgipes ** Mylodontidae spp. *** Catonyx *** Glossotherium *** Lestodon *** Mylodon *** Nematherium *** Octomylodon *** Orophodon *** Scelidotherium * All remaining Glyptodontinae spp. ** Doedicurus ** Eleutherocercus ** Glyptodon/Chlamydotherium ** Heteroglyptodon ** Hoplophorus ** Lomaphorus ** Neosclerocalyptus ** Neuryurus ** Panochthus ** Parapanochthus ** Plaxhaplous ** Sclerocalyptus * Several Dasypodidae spp. ** Beautiful armadillo (Dasypus bellus) ** Eutatus ** Pachyarmatherium ** Propaopus * All Pampatheriidae spp. ** Holmesina (et Chlamytherium occidentale) ** Pampatherium ** Tonnicinctus * Psilopterus (small terror bird remains dated to the Late Pleistocene, but these are disputed) * Various Caracarinae spp. ** Venezuelan caracara (Caracara major) ** Seymour's caracara (Caracara seymouri) ** Peruvian caracara (Milvago brodkorbi) * Caiman venezuelensis The Pacific (Australasia and Oceania) Thylacoleo carnifex rock art Procoptodon goliath reconstruction The American flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber) was one of four species of flamingo present in Australia in the Quaternary, all of which are now either extinct or extirpated.

In Sahul (a former continent composed of Australia and New Guinea), the sudden and extensive spate of extinctions occurred earlier than in the rest of the world. Most evidence points to a 20,000 year period after human arrival circa 63,000 BCE, but scientific argument continues as to the exact date range. In the rest of the Pacific (other Australasian islands such as New Caledonia, and Oceania) although in some respects far later, endemic fauna also usually perished quickly upon the arrival of humans in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene.

Relationship to later extinctions  There is no general agreement on where the Holocene, or anthropogenic, extinction begins, and the Quaternary extinction event ends, or if they should be considered separate events at all. Some have suggested that anthropogenic extinctions may have begun as early as when the first modern humans spread out of Africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, which is supported by rapid megafaunal extinction following recent human colonisation in Australia, New Zealand and Madagascar, in a similar way that any large, adaptable predator moving into a new ecosystem would. In many cases, it is suggested even minimal hunting pressure was enough to wipe out large fauna, particularly on geographically isolated islands. Only during the most recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses. Overall, the Holocene extinction can be characterised by the human impact on the environment. The Holocene extinction continues into the 21st century, with overfishing, ocean acidification and the amphibian crisis being a few broader examples of an almost universal, cosmopolitan decline of biodiversity. Hunting hypothesis A woolly mammoth hunt The hunting hypothesis suggests that humans hunted megaherbivores to extinction, which in turn caused the extinction of carnivores and scavengers which had preyed upon those animals. Therefore, this hypothesis holds Pleistocene humans responsible for the megafaunal extinction. One variant, known as blitzkrieg, portrays this process as relatively quick. Some of the direct evidence for this includes: fossils of some megafauna found in conjunction with human remains, embedded arrows and tool cut marks found in megafaunal bones, and European cave paintings that depict such hunting. Biogeographical evidence is also suggestive: the areas of the world where humans evolved currently have more of their Pleistocene megafaunal diversity (the elephants and rhinos of Asia and Africa) compared to other areas such as Australia, the Americas, Madagascar and New Zealand without the earliest humans. A picture arises of the megafauna of Asia and Africa evolving alongside humans, learning to be wary of them, and in other parts of the world the wildlife appearing ecologically naive and easier to hunt. This is particularly true of island fauna, which display a disastrous lack of fear of humans. Of course, it is impossible to demonstrate this na√Øvet√© directly in ancient fauna. The earliest finds of Homo sapiens point to an emergence during the Middle Pleistocene of Africa. However, there is evidence of extinction waves, particularly of megafaunal carnivores, coinciding with both cranial and technological developments within ancestral Homo during the Early Pleistocene of Africa. This has suggested a human role in these ecological cascades. H. sapiens skull described from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, dated to 315,000 BCE. Despeciation within the genus Homo. H. sapiens migration routes in the Pleistocene. Circumstantially, the close correlation in time between the appearance of humans in an area and extinction there provides weight for this scenario. The megafaunal extinctions covered a vast period of time and highly variable climatic situations. The earliest extinctions in Australia were complete approximately 50,000 BP, well before the last glacial maximum and before rises in temperature. The most recent extinction in New Zealand was complete no earlier than 500 BP and during a period of cooling. In between these extremes megafaunal extinctions have occurred progressively in such places as North America, South America and Madagascar with no climatic commonality. The only common factor that can be ascertained is the arrival of humans. This phenomenon appears even within regions. The mammal extinction wave in Australia about 50,000 years ago coincides not with known climatic changes, but with the arrival of humans. In addition, large mammal species like the giant kangaroo Protemnodon appear to have succumbed sooner on the Australian mainland than on Tasmania, which was colonised by humans a few thousand years later. Worldwide, extinctions seem to follow the migration of humans and to be most severe where humans arrived most recently and least severe where humans originated ‚Äî in Africa (see figure \\"March of Man\\" below). This suggests that prey animals and human hunting ability evolved together, so the animals evolved avoidance techniques. As humans migrated throughout the world and became more and more proficient at hunting, they encountered animals that had evolved without the presence of humans. Lacking the fear of humans that African animals had developed, animals outside of Africa were easy prey for human hunting techniques. It also suggests that this is independent of climate change. Extinction through human hunting has been supported by archaeological finds of mammoths with projectile points embedded in their skeletons, by observations of modern na√Øve animals allowing hunters to approach easily and by computer models by Mosimann and Martin, and Whittington and Dyke, and most recently by Alroy. A study published in 2015 supported the hypothesis further by running several thousand scenarios that correlated the time windows in which each species is known to have become extinct with the arrival of humans on different continents or islands. This was compared against climate reconstructions for the last 90,000 years. The researchers found correlations of human spread and species extinction indicating that the human impact was the main cause of the extinction, while climate change exacerbated the frequency of extinctions. The study, however, found an apparently low extinction rate in the fossil record of mainland Asia. Overkill hypothesis The timing of extinctions follows the \\"March of Man\\" The overkill hypothesis, a variant of the hunting hypothesis, was proposed in 1966 by Paul S. Martin, Professor of Geosciences Emeritus at the Desert Laboratory of the University of Arizona. Objections to the hunting hypothesis The major objections to the theory are as follows: * In predator-prey models it is unlikely that predators could over-hunt their prey, since predators need their prey as food to sustain life and to reproduce. This assumes that all food sources die out simultaneously, but humans could have made the mammoth extinct while subsisting on elk, for example. Human hunting is known to have exterminated megafauna on several islands, switching to other food sources with time or dying out themselves. Additionally it is common knowledge among ornithologists that introduced predators have easily made several species extinct on islands, and this is a foremost cause of island extinctions today. * There is no archeological evidence that in North America megafauna other than mammoths, mastodons, gomphotheres and bison were hunted, despite the fact that, for example, camels and horses are very frequently reported in fossil history. Overkill proponents, however, say this is due to the fast extinction process in North America and the low probability of animals with signs of butchery to be preserved.Fiedel, S., Haynes, G., 2004. A premature burial: comments on Grayson and Meltzer‚Äôs Requiem for overkill Journal of Archaeological Science 31, 121‚Äì131. Additionally, biochemical analyses have shown that Clovis tools were used in butchering horses and camels. A study by Surovell and Grund concluded \\"archaeological sites dating to the time of the coexistence of humans and extinct fauna are rare. Those that preserve bone are considerably more rare, and of those, only a very few show unambiguous evidence of human hunting of any type of prey whatsoever.\\" * A small number of animals that were hunted, such as a single species of bison, did not go extinct. This cannot be explained by proposing that surviving bison in North America were recent Eurasian immigrants that were familiar with human hunting practices, since Bison first appeared in North America approximately 240,000 years ago and then evolved into living bison. Bison at the end of the Pleistocene were thus likely to have been almost as naive as their native North American megafaunal companions. * The dwarfing of animals is not explained by overkill. Numerous authors, however, have pointed out that dwarfing of animals is perfectly well explained by humans selectively harvesting the largest animals, and have provided proof that even within the 20th century numerous animal populations have reduced in average size due to human hunting. * Eurasian Pleistocene megafauna became extinct in roughly same time period despite having a much longer time to adapt to hunting pressure by humans. However, the extinction of the Eurasian megafauna can be viewed as a result of a different process than that of the American megafauna. This makes the theory less parsimonious since another mechanism is required. The latter case occurred after the sudden appearance of modern human hunters on a land mass they had never previously inhabited, while the former case was the culmination of the gradual northward movement of human hunters over thousands of years as their technology for enduring extreme cold and bringing down big game improved. Thus, while the hunting hypothesis does not necessarily predict the rough simultaneity of the north Eurasian and American megafaunal extinctions, this simultaneity cannot be regarded as evidence against it. * Eugene S. Hunn points out that the birthrate in hunter-gatherer societies is generally too low, that too much effort is involved in the bringing down of a large animal by a hunting party, and that in order for hunter-gatherers to have brought about the extinction of megafauna simply by hunting them to death, an extraordinary amount of meat would have had to have been wasted. It is possible that those who advocate the overkill hypothesis simply have not considered the differences in outlook between typical forager (hunter- gatherer) cultures and the present-day industrial cultures which exist in modernized human societies; waste may be tolerated and even encouraged in the latter, but is not so much in the former. It may be noted that in relatively recent human history, for instance, the Lakota of North America were known to take only as much bison as they could use, and they used virtually the whole animal‚Äîthis despite having access to herds numbering in the millions.Svenson, Sally. \\"Bison .\\" South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks, 1995. Conversely, \\"buffalo jumps\\"\\"Buffalo Jump.\\" Wikipedia. featured indiscriminate killing of a herd. However, Hunn's comments are in reference to the now largely discredited theory of hunter-prey equilibrium reached after thousands of years of coexistence. It is not relevant to hunters newly arrived on a virgin land mass full of easily taken big game. The well-established practice of industrial-scale moa butchering by the early Maori, involving enormous wastage of less choice portions of the meat, indicates that these arguments are incorrect. * The hypothesis that the Clovis culture represented the first humans to arrive in the New World has been disputed recently. (See Settlement of the Americas.) However, Clovis artifacts are currently the earliest-known evidence of widespread settlement in the Americas. Climate change hypothesis At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, when scientists first realized that there had been glacial and interglacial ages, and that they were somehow associated with the prevalence or disappearance of certain animals, they surmised that the termination of the Pleistocene ice age might be an explanation for the extinctions. Critics object that since there were multiple glacial advances and withdrawals in the evolutionary history of many of the megafauna, it is rather implausible that only after the last glacial maximum would there be such extinctions. However, this criticism is rejected by a recent study indicating that terminal Pleistocene megafaunal community composition may have differed markedly from faunas present during earlier interglacials, particularly with respect to the great abundance and geographic extent of Pleistocene Bison at the end of the epoch. This suggests that the survival of megafaunal populations during earlier interglacials is essentially irrelevant to the terminal Pleistocene extinction event, because bison were not present in similar abundance during any of the earlier interglacials. Some evidence weighs against climate change as a valid hypothesis as applied to Australia. It has been shown that the prevailing climate at the time of extinction (40,000‚Äì50,000 BP) was similar to that of today, and that the extinct animals were strongly adapted to an arid climate. The evidence indicates that all of the extinctions took place in the same short time period, which was the time when humans entered the landscape. The main mechanism for extinction was probably fire (started by humans) in a then much less fire-adapted landscape. Isotopic evidence shows sudden changes in the diet of surviving species, which could correspond to the stress they experienced before extinction. Evidence in Southeast Asia, in contrast to Europe, Australia, and the Americas, suggests that climate change and an increasing sea level were significant factors in the extinction of several herbivorous species. Alterations in vegetation growth and new access routes for early humans and mammals to previously isolated, localized ecosystems were detrimental to select groups of fauna. Some evidence obtained from analysis of the tusks of mastodons from the American Great Lakes region appears inconsistent with the climate change hypothesis. Over a span of several thousand years prior to their extinction in the area, the mastodons show a trend of declining age at maturation. This is the opposite of what one would expect if they were experiencing stresses from deteriorating environmental conditions, but is consistent with a reduction in intraspecific competition that would result from a population being reduced by human hunting.  Increased temperature  The most obvious change associated with the termination of an ice age is the increase in temperature. Between 15,000 BP and 10,000 BP, a 6 ¬∞C increase in global mean annual temperatures occurred. This was generally thought to be the cause of the extinctions. According to this hypothesis, a temperature increase sufficient to melt the Wisconsin ice sheet could have placed enough thermal stress on cold-adapted mammals to cause them to die. Their heavy fur, which helps conserve body heat in the glacial cold, might have prevented the dumping of excess heat, causing the mammals to die of heat exhaustion. Large mammals, with their reduced surface area-to- volume ratio, would have fared worse than small mammals. A study covering the past 56,000 years indicates that rapid warming events with temperature changes of up to had an important impact on the extinction of megafauna. Ancient DNA and radiocarbon data indicates that local genetic populations were replaced by others within the same species or by others within the same genus. Survival of populations was dependent on the existence of refugia and long distance dispersals, which may have been disrupted by human hunters.  Arguments against the temperature hypothesis  Studies propose that the annual mean temperature of the current interglacial that we have seen for the last 10,000 years is no higher than that of previous interglacials, yet some of the same large mammals survived similar temperature increases. Therefore, warmer temperatures alone may not be a sufficient explanation. In addition, numerous species such as mammoths on Wrangel Island and St. Paul Island survived in human-free refugia despite changes in climate. This would not be expected if climate change were responsible (unless their maritime climates offered some protection against climate change not afforded to coastal populations on the mainland). Under normal ecological assumptions island populations should be more vulnerable to extinction due to climate change because of small populations and an inability to migrate to more favorable climes.  Increased continentality affects vegetation in time or space  Other scientists have proposed that increasingly extreme weather‚Äîhotter summers and colder winters‚Äîreferred to as \\"continentality\\", or related changes in rainfall caused the extinctions. The various hypotheses are outlined below. =Vegetation changes: geographic= It has been shown that vegetation changed from mixed woodland-parkland to separate prairie and woodland. This may have affected the kinds of food available. Shorter growing seasons may have caused the extinction of large herbivores and the dwarfing of many others. In this case, as observed, bison and other large ruminants would have fared better than horses, elephants and other monogastrics, because ruminants are able to extract more nutrition from limited quantities of high-fiber food and better able to deal with anti-herbivory toxins. So, in general, when vegetation becomes more specialized, herbivores with less diet flexibility may be less able to find the mix of vegetation they need to sustain life and reproduce, within a given area. =Rainfall changes: time= Increased continentality resulted in reduced and less predictable rainfall limiting the availability of plants necessary for energy and nutrition. Axelrod and Slaughter have suggested that this change in rainfall restricted the amount of time favorable for reproduction. This could disproportionately harm large animals, since they have longer, more inflexible mating periods, and so may have produced young at unfavorable seasons (i.e., when sufficient food, water, or shelter was unavailable because of shifts in the growing season). In contrast, small mammals, with their shorter life cycles, shorter reproductive cycles, and shorter gestation periods, could have adjusted to the increased unpredictability of the climate, both as individuals and as species which allowed them to synchronize their reproductive efforts with conditions favorable for offspring survival. If so, smaller mammals would have lost fewer offspring and would have been better able to repeat the reproductive effort when circumstances once more favored offspring survival. In 2017 a study looked at the environmental conditions across Europe, Siberia and the Americas from 25,000‚Äì10,000 YBP. The study found that prolonged warming events leading to deglaciation and maximum rainfall occurred just prior to the transformation of the rangelands that supported megaherbivores into widespread wetlands that supported herbivore-resistant plants. The study proposes that moisture-driven environmental change led to the megafaunal extinctions and that Africa's trans-equatorial position allowed rangeland to continue to exist between the deserts and the central forests, therefore fewer megafauna species became extinct there.  Arguments against the continentality hypotheses  Critics have identified a number of problems with the continentality hypotheses. * Megaherbivores have prospered at other times of continental climate. For example, megaherbivores thrived in Pleistocene Siberia, which had and has a more continental climate than Pleistocene or modern (post-Pleistocene, interglacial) North America. * The animals that became extinct actually should have prospered during the shift from mixed woodland-parkland to prairie, because their primary food source, grass, was increasing rather than decreasing. Although the vegetation did become more spatially specialized, the amount of prairie and grass available increased, which would have been good for horses and for mammoths, and yet they became extinct. This criticism ignores the increased abundance and broad geographic extent of Pleistocene Bison at the end of the Pleistocene, which would have increased competition for these resources in a manner not seen in any earlier interglacials. * Although horses became extinct in the New World, they were successfully reintroduced by the Spanish in the 16th century‚Äîinto a modern post- Pleistocene, interglacial climate. Today there are feral horses still living in those same environments. They find a sufficient mix of food to avoid toxins, they extract enough nutrition from forage to reproduce effectively and the timing of their gestation is not an issue. Of course, this criticism ignores the obvious fact that present-day horses are not competing for resources with ground sloths, mammoths, mastodons, camels, llamas, and bison. Similarly, mammoths survived the Pleistocene Holocene transition on isolated, uninhabited islands in the Mediterranean Sea and on Wrangel Island in the Siberian Arctic until 4,000 to 7,000 years ago. * Large mammals should have been able to migrate, permanently or seasonally, if they found the temperature too extreme, the breeding season too short, or the rainfall too sparse or unpredictable. Seasons vary geographically. By migrating away from the equator, herbivores could have found areas with growing seasons more favorable for finding food and breeding successfully. Modern-day African elephants migrate during periods of drought to places where there is apt to be water. * Large animals store more fat in their bodies than do medium-sized animals and this should have allowed them to compensate for extreme seasonal fluctuations in food availability. The extinction of the megafauna could have caused the disappearance of the mammoth steppe. Alaska now has low nutrient soil unable to support bison, mammoths, and horses. R. Dale Guthrie has claimed this as a cause of the extinction of the megafauna there; however, he may be interpreting it backwards. The loss of large herbivores to break up the permafrost allows the cold soils that are unable to support large herbivores today. Today, in the arctic, where trucks have broken the permafrost grasses and diverse flora and fauna can be supported. In addition, Chapin (Chapin 1980) showed that simply adding fertilizer to the soil in Alaska could make grasses grow again like they did in the era of the mammoth steppe. Possibly, the extinction of the megafauna and the corresponding loss of dung is what led to low nutrient levels in modern-day soil and therefore is why the landscape can no longer support megafauna.  Arguments against both climate change and overkill  It may be observed that neither the overkill nor the climate change hypotheses can fully explain events: browsers, mixed feeders and non- ruminant grazer species suffered most, while relatively more ruminant grazers survived. However, a broader variation of the overkill hypothesis may predict this, because changes in vegetation wrought by either Second Order Predation (see below) or anthropogenic fire preferentially selects against browse species. Hyperdisease hypothesis  Theory  The hyperdisease hypothesis attributes the extinction of large mammals during the late Pleistocene to indirect effects of the newly arrived aboriginal humans. The Hyperdisease Hypothesis proposes that humans or animals traveling with them (e.g., chickens or domestic dogs) introduced one or more highly virulent diseases into vulnerable populations of native mammals, eventually causing extinctions. The extinction was biased toward larger-sized species because smaller species have greater resilience because of their life history traits (e.g., shorter gestation time, greater population sizes, etc.). Humans are thought to be the cause because other earlier immigrations of mammals into North America from Eurasia did not cause extinctions. Diseases imported by people have been responsible for extinctions in the recent past; for example, bringing avian malaria to Hawaii has had a major impact on the isolated birds of the island. If a disease was indeed responsible for the end-Pleistocene extinctions, then there are several criteria it must satisfy (see Table 7.3 in MacPhee & Marx 1997). First, the pathogen must have a stable carrier state in a reservoir species. That is, it must be able to sustain itself in the environment when there are no susceptible hosts available to infect. Second, the pathogen must have a high infection rate, such that it is able to infect virtually all individuals of all ages and sexes encountered. Third, it must be extremely lethal, with a mortality rate of c. 50‚Äì75%. Finally, it must have the ability to infect multiple host species without posing a serious threat to humans. Humans may be infected, but the disease must not be highly lethal or able to cause an epidemic. One suggestion is that pathogens were transmitted by the expanding humans via the domesticated dogs they brought with them. Unfortunately for such a theory it can not account for several major extinction events, notably Australia and North America. Dogs did not arrive in Australia until approximately 35,000 years after the first humans arrived and approximately 30,000 years after the megafaunal extinction was complete and as such can not be implicated. In contrast numerous species including wolves, mammoths, camelids and horses had emigrated continually between Asia and North America over the past 100,000 years. For the disease hypothesis to be applicable in the case of the Americas it would require that the population remain immunologically naive despite this constant transmission of genetic and pathogenic material. Arguments against the hyperdisease hypothesis * Generally speaking, disease has to be very virulent to kill off all the individuals in a genus or species. Even such a virulent disease as West Nile fever is unlikely to have caused extinction. * The disease would need to be implausibly selective while being simultaneously implausibly broad. Such a disease needs to be capable of killing off wolves such as Canis dirus or goats such as Oreamnos harringtoni while leaving other very similar species (Canis lupus and Oreamnos americanus, respectively) unaffected. It would need to be capable of killing off flightless birds while leaving closely related flighted species unaffected. Yet while remaining sufficiently selective to afflict only individual species within genera it must be capable of fatally infecting across such clades as birds, marsupials, placentals, testudines, and crocodilians. No disease with such a broad scope of fatal infectivity is known, much less one that remains simultaneously incapable of infecting numerous closely related species within those disparate clades. Second-order predation hypothesis Combination Hypotheses: Climate Change, Overkill + Climate Change, Second-Order Predation + Climate Change Overkill Hypothesis and Second-Order Predation  Scenario  The Second-Order Predation Hypothesis says that as humans entered the New World they continued their policy of killing predators, which had been successful in the Old World but because they were more efficient and because the fauna, both herbivores and carnivores, were more naive, they killed off enough carnivores to upset the ecological balance of the continent, causing overpopulation, environmental exhaustion, and environmental collapse. The hypothesis accounts for changes in animal, plant, and human populations. The scenario is as follows: * After the arrival of H. sapiens in the New World, existing predators must share the prey populations with this new predator. Because of this competition, populations of original, or first-order, predators cannot find enough food; they are in direct competition with humans. * Second-order predation begins as humans begin to kill predators. * Prey populations are no longer well controlled by predation. Killing of nonhuman predators by H. sapiens reduces their numbers to a point where these predators no longer regulate the size of the prey populations. * Lack of regulation by first-order predators triggers boom-and- bust cycles in prey populations. Prey populations expand and consequently overgraze and over-browse the land. Soon the environment is no longer able to support them. As a result, many herbivores starve. Species that rely on the slowest recruiting food become extinct, followed by species that cannot extract the maximum benefit from every bit of their food. * Boom-bust cycles in herbivore populations change the nature of the vegetative environment, with consequent climatic impacts on relative humidity and continentality. Through overgrazing and overbrowsing, mixed parkland becomes grassland, and climatic continentality increases.  Support  This has been supported by a computer model, the Pleistocene extinction model (PEM), which, using the same assumptions and values for all variables (herbivore population, herbivore recruitment rates, food needed per human, herbivore hunting rates, etc.) other than those for hunting of predators. It compares the overkill hypothesis (predator hunting = 0) with second-order predation (predator hunting varied between 0.01 and 0.05 for different runs). The findings are that second-order predation is more consistent with extinction than is overkill (results graph at left). The Pleistocene extinction model is the only test of multiple hypotheses and is the only model to specifically test combination hypotheses by artificially introducing sufficient climate change to cause extinction. When overkill and climate change are combined they balance each other out. Climate change reduces the number of plants, overkill removes animals, therefore fewer plants are eaten. Second-order predation combined with climate change exacerbates the effect of climate change. (results graph at right). The second-order predation hypothesis is supported by the observation above that there was a massive increase in bison populations.Scott, E. (2010). \\"Extinctions, scenarios, and assumptions: Changes in latest Pleistocene large herbivore abundance and distribution in western North America\\". Quat. Int.  Second-order predation and other theories  * Climate change: Second-order predation accounts for the changes in vegetation, which in turn may account for the increase in continentality. Since the extinction is due to destruction of habitat it accounts for the loss of animals not hunted by humans. Second- order predation accounts for the dwarfing of animals as well as extinctions since animals that could survive and reproduce on less food would be selectively favored. * Hyperdisease: The reduction of carnivores could have been from distemper or other carnivore disease carried by domestic dogs. * Overkill: The observation that extinctions follow the arrival of humans is consistent with the second-order predation hypothesis.  Arguments against the second-order predation hypothesis  * The model specifically assumes high extinction rates in grasslands, but most extinct species ranged across numerous vegetation zones. Historical population densities of ungulates were very high in the Great Plains; savanna environments support high ungulate diversity throughout Africa, and extinction intensity was equally severe in forested environments. * It is unable to explain why large herbivore populations were not regulated by surviving carnivores such as grizzly bears, wolves, pumas, and jaguars whose populations would have increased rapidly in response to the loss of competitors. * It does not explain why almost all extinct carnivores were large herbivore specialists such as sabre toothed cats and short faced bears, but most hypocarnivores and generalized carnivores survived. * There is no historical evidence of boom and bust cycles causing even local extinctions in regions where large mammal predators have been driven extinct by hunting. The recent hunting out of remaining predators throughout most of the United States has not caused massive vegetational change or dramatic boom and bust cycles in ungulates. * It is not spatially explicit and does not track predator and prey species separately, whereas the multispecies overkill model does both. * The multispecies model produces a mass extinction through indirect competition between herbivore species: small species with high reproductive rates subsidize predation on large species with low reproductive rates. All prey species are lumped in the Pleistocene extinction model. * Everything explained by the Pleistocene extinction model also is explained by the multispecies model, but with fewer assumptions, so the Pleistocene extinction model appears less parsimonious. However, the multispecies model does not explain shifts in vegetation, nor is it able to simulate alternative hypotheses. The multispecies model therefore necessitates additional assumptions and hence is less parsimonious.  Arguments against the second-order predation plus climate hypothesis  * It assumes decreases in vegetation due to climate change, but deglaciation doubled the habitable area of North America. * Any vegetational changes that did occur failed to cause almost any extinctions of small vertebrates, and they are more narrowly distributed on average. Comet hypothesis First publicly presented at the Spring 2007 joint assembly of the American Geophysical Union in Acapulco, Mexico, the comet hypothesis suggests that the mass extinction was caused by a swarm of comets 12,900 years ago. Using photomicrograph analysis, research published in January 2009 has found evidence of nanodiamonds in the soil from six sites across North America including Arizona, Minnesota, Oklahoma, South Carolina and two Canadian sites. Similar research found nanodiamonds in the Greenland ice sheet.Study links mammoth extinction, comets, USA Today, Updated 1/2/2009.

Arguments against/for the comet hypothesis Debate around this hypothesis has included, among other things, the lack of an impact crater, relatively small increased level of iridium in the soil, and the relative probability of such an event. That said, it took 10 years after publication of the Alvarez theory before scientists found the Chicxulub crater. If the bolide struck the Laurentide ice sheet as hypothesized by Firestone et al. (2007), we would not see the typical impact crater. A spike in platinum was found in the Greenland ice cores by Petaev et al. (2013), which they view as a global signal. Confirmation came in 2017 with the report that the Pt spike had been found at \\"11 widely separated archaeological bulk sedimentary sequences.\\" Wolbach et al. reported in 2018 that \\"YDB peaks in Pt were observed at 28 sites\\" in total, including the 11 reported earlier and the one from Greenland. * Some have reported a lack of evidence for a population decline among the Paleoindians at 12,900 ¬± 100 calBP. However, others have reported finding such evidence. * There is evidence that the megafaunal extinctions that occurred across northern Eurasia, North America and South America at the end of the Pleistocene were not synchronous as the bolide theory would predict. The extinctions in South America appear to have occurred at least 400 years after those in North America. * Additionally, some island megafaunal populations survived thousands of years longer than populations of the same or related species on nearby continents; examples include the survival of woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island until 3700 BP, and the survival of ground sloths in the Antilles until 4700 cal BP. * Several markers for the proposed impact event are disputed. Opponents have asserted that the carbon spherules originated as fungal structures and/or insect fecal pellets, and that the claimed nanodiamonds are actually misidentified graphene and graphene/graphane oxide aggregates. An analysis of a similar Younger Dryas boundary layer in Belgium also did not show evidence of a bolide impact. *However, proponents of the hypothesis have responded to defend their results, disputing the accusation of irreproducibility and/or replicating their findings. Prior to finding of a widespread Pt spike on the continents, Pleistocene expert Wallace Broecker had already changed his mind about the YDIH: \\"The Greenland platinum peak makes clear that an extraterrestrial impact occurred close to the onset of the YD.\\" See also   References External links Hyperdisease hypothesis Second-order predation * Other links  * Extinction events Pleistocene Events that forced the climate ","title":"Quaternary extinction event"},{"id":"18783055","text":"Benjamin Franklin Jones, Sr. (August 8, 1824 ‚Äì May 19, 1903) was a pioneer of the iron and steel industry in Pittsburgh.

Early life and family Born in Kaikoura on 22 October 1914, Boot was the son of Percy Vernon Boot and Estelle Marie Boot (formerly England, n√©e Edge). He was educated at Ashburton High School and Timaru Boys' High School, and went on to study at Canterbury Agricultural College from 1934 to 1935, where he trained for a diploma in agriculture. In 1937, Boot joined the Department of Agriculture as an assistant fields instructor. On 23 March 1940, Boot married Lorna Hinepare Kessell at St Peter's Church, Wellington. Lorna Boot died from meningitis on 15 September 1943 while her husband was serving overseas during World War II. Athletics As a schoolboy at Timaru Boys' High School, Boot ran the 880 yards in 2:00.0, and the 1 mile in 4:26.8. Boot competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin in the men's 800 metres, finishing last in his semi-final. Like his teammate, Cecil Matthews, he suffered tendon problems from running on the decks of the Wanganella en route to the games, and was below his best form. He withdrew from the fourth heat of the 1500 metres. At the 1938 British Empire Games in Sydney, Boot won the gold medal in the men's 880 yards with a tremendous sprint 70 yards from the end. His time of 1:51.2 was an Empire Games and Australian record. In the 1 mile, he won the bronze medal, finishing six yards behind the winner, Jim Alford of Wales. Boot won five New Zealand national athletics titles: the 880 yards in 1936, 1938, 1939, and 1940; and the 1 mile in 1936. Military service In World War II, Boot trained as an officer at the Army Training School at Trentham. He went overseas with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force not long after his marriage, and served in the Middle East and Italy. Rising to the rank of captain, Boot suffered from jaundice while serving in Italy in 1944, and in 1945, after his return to New Zealand he was accidentally badly scalded. Death Boot was an instructor in agriculture at Gisborne when he died on 15 January 1947 when under anaesthesia for dental treatment. He was buried at Taruheru Cemetery, Gisborne.

He worked in Austria-Hungary, Germany and in the United States. As a playwright in Europe he gained his biggest popularity in 1910 - 1917, then he was forgotten. From the 1920s to 1940s he worked mainly as a screenwriter, first in Germany, later in the United States, to which he emigrated in September 1927. In the United States he returned to writing the stage plays. He was writing in German and later on in the United States, in English. Until recently, only a minimal amount of information about his life was available. In addition there were many legends and rumours concerning Birinski's person, some of them even spread by himself. For example, the false report of his \\"suicide\\" in 1920 even found its way from the newspaper obituaries into encyclopedias.  Variations in his name  Leo Birinski - surname after his mother, approx. from 1908 his civil and stage name. Other variations in spelling and form: Leo G. Birinski, Leo Birinsky, Lev G. Birinski, Lev Birinskij, Lav Birinski, Birinszki Le√≥, Lev Birinszkij, Leon Birinski, etc. Leo Gottesmann - surname after his father, used as his civil name until at least 1906.  Biography  The circumstances of Birinski's early life are quite indefinite; different sources offer eight possibilities of his place and date of birth. He was probably born on June 8, 1884, in Lysianka, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Ukraine). He occasionally presented this information in official documents, and it is supported by some indirect evidence, although it is impossible to prove definitively because the local birth records for Lysianka were not preserved. His father, Hersch Gottesmann, was born in Borschiv in eastern Galicia and was a salesman (he indicated \\"Agent\\" as his employment in registration forms). His mother, Carna, born Berinska or Birinska, was a tenant's daughter from Lysianka. Birinski spent his childhood in Ukraine and Czernowitz, the capital city of the Austro-Hungarian province of Bukovina. At the beginning of the 20th century (either in 1901 or 1904, according to the sources consulted), he moved to Vienna. He worked in a bookshop, turned to translating and started to write by himself. From his Viennese era come three of Birinski's plays: the tragedies Der Moloch (The Moloch) and Raskolnikoff (after the novel Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky), and his most successful comedy (or tragicomedy, according to Birinski) Narrentanz (Dance of Fools), written in 1912. In March 1920, the already-mentioned suicide rumour, caused by a mistaken identity with his younger namesake, Leon Gottesmann, was spread in the local newspapers. Although repeatedly denied, the report was included into several contemporary encyclopedias. In fact, in April 1921 Birinski left Vienna and moved to Berlin. Das Wachsfigurenkabinett; Leo Birinski is on the right, sitting on the white horse (c. 1923). In Germany, Birinski probably married Jewish pianist Felicia Aschkenas, born probably in 1902 in Warsaw. He worked primarily for the movie industry, wrote many screenplays, and together with Paul Leni, directed the motion picture Das Wachsfigurenkabinett. During his German era he demonstrably participated in the screenplays of thirteen films, e.g. Tragedy of Love with Marlene Dietrich, Variet√© by Ewald Andr√© Dupont, and pictures by Gennaro Righelli. Birinski also wrote stage play Der heilige Teufel (Rasputin). Its German text was not found, just the later English version. Probably in September 1927 Birinski left for the USA; two years later, his wife followed him. They both identified themselves to the immigration officers by Nicaraguan passports. Birinski had even listed the city of Bluefields in Nicaragua as his birthplace. Most probably this was just a false identity. In the United States, he continued his work as an author of motion picture stories and screenplays (he participated in the ten documented films). The first Birinski's American work was probably direction of Das gro√üe Gl√ºck ‚Äì the German version of A Ship Comes In from 1928. Some of his pictures belong among the so-called \\"major\\" films of the period: e.g. Mata Hari with Greta Garbo or Mamoulian¬¥s movies The Song of Songs, with Marlene Dietrich, and The Gay Desperado. He once again tried the work of film director with Flirtation in 1934. The last known picture by Birinski was the spy comedy The Lady Has Plans in 1942. An adaptation for the radio series, Lux Radio Theater, was also created, and broadcast in April 1943 on the CBS radio network with Rita Hayworth and William Powell in the leads. Birinski also wrote several stage plays in the USA. On Broadway his play Nowhere Bound was presented in January 1935 at the Imperial Theatre, and The Day Will Come in September 1944 at the National Theatre. In addition to these works, a manuscript of a stage play The Holy Devil (Rasputin) was found among the papers left by Herman Bernstein (a journalist and writer who died in August 1935). This play was probably never performed or published. The last seven years of Birinski's life are enfolded in mist again. According to the extant death certificate, Leo Birinski died on October 23, 1951 at Lincoln Hospital in The Bronx, New York City. The certificate includes almost no information about the deceased. It appears that Birinski died in poverty and probably entirely alone (without any relatives or heirs). He was buried at Potter's Field at Hart Island in a mass-grave (\\"plot 45, section 2, no. 14\\"). In 2009, Birinski's relatives living in Israel and United States were found.

Naval career He entered the navy in 1931, completing a four-year course at the Royal Naval Engineering College at Keyham. During the Second World War Turner travelled to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to commission and bring back HMS Newark to the United Kingdom; then spent a period at the RNEC and at HMS Condor (the Royal Naval Air Station at Arbroath), before joining the aircraft carrier in 1944 as air engineer officer.Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives, kcl.ac.uk; accessed 5 April 2016. Indomitable was the carrier squadron flagship in the British Pacific Fleet and Turner's department maintained a very high aircraft serviceability rate for the fleet's strikes. Turner was twice mentioned in despatches, having taken part in air strikes against Okinawa, Japan in 1945. After the Second World War, Turner planned the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm. From 1954 Turner served in the Engineer in Chief's department at Bath, laying the foundation for the Navy's planned maintenance organisation. His other positions included: Captain Superintendent of the Royal Naval Aircraft Yard at Donibristle (1956‚Äì58), Director of Aircraft Maintenance and Planning in London, Chief Staff Officer (Technical) on the Central Staff, Mediterranean Fleet (1962‚Äì64), Director-General of Aircraft (Navy) at the Ministry of Defence (1964‚Äì67) and Chief of Fleet Support at the Ministry of Defence (1967‚Äì71). Turner was promoted to Vice-Admiral in June 1968. In 1970, Turner made naval history by becoming the first officer of a non-executive branch to reach the rank of full Admiral. He was one of the Navy's first specialists in naval aeronautical engineering and pioneered the introduction of planned maintenance to improve the reliability of the fleet's machinery.The Papers of Admiral Sir (Arthur) Francis Turner, janus.lib.cam.ac.uk; accessed 5 April 2016.

Formed in 1950 to commemorate the men who fought on both sides during the war, the association is based mainly in the eastern United States, there are related associations in the western United States Civil War Skirmish Association website A shot from the weekday matches at the N-SSA Fall Nationals 2014 Organization N-SSA matches, known as Skirmishes, are not re-enactments of specific Civil War battles. Rather, the N-SSA is concerned with promoting the accurate shooting of the firearms of the era. Matches are devoted to authentic firearms accuracy, with a secondary, but still important, devotion to historical accuracy in uniforms and equipment. Unlike most American Civil War reenactments, skirmish events are composed of individuals and teams that fire live ammunition at paper and breakable targets. Competitors can shoot firearms that are either original (e.g., date from 1861‚Äì65) or are N-SSA approved reproductions of firearms issued to soldiers from that period. Individual events are usually composed of paper bullseye targets at varying ranges, with five or ten shots for score. The core of N-SSA shooting is the 8-man musket team match. Uniformed Union and Confederate teams compete in timed, rapid-fire events, shooting at breakable targets such as clay pigeons, ceramic tiles, and clay flower pots at ranges of 50 and . The team with the lowest time wins. The N-SSA is a team-based organization rather than individual-based; one belongs to a team first and then to the larger N-SSA organization. But it is the N-SSA which issues membership cards to individual competitors. Teams are grouped into thirteen Regions. Each Region has roughly ten to fifteen teams, and is responsible for holding a Regional Championship at least annually. Geographically, many of the Regions overlap each other, as the N-SSA organizes new Regions to accommodate the creation of new teams. History\\"The N-SSA: A History.\\" The Skirmish Line, Volume XX, No. 3, May 1975: p3-8. In 1949, John L. Rawls ran across an article describing Ernest W. Peterkin's avid interest in Civil War era muskets. The two exchanged letters, and agreed to plan a Civil War display at a local gun club. On May 28, 1950 Rawls and Peterkin were invited to meet and put on a display of Civil War weaponry, uniforms, and equipment at the Berwin Rod and Gun Club in Murkirk, Maryland. Rawls arrived with seven men, the \\"Norfolk Long Rifles\\", dressed in period Confederate infantry uniforms. Peterkin and his five \\"Berwyn Blue Bellies\\" were dressed in period Union infantry uniforms. At the scheduled hour these men fired at individual targets, and participated in a team event that used balloons as targets. The Norfolk Long Rifles won the match. This event has come to be known as the \\"First Skirmish\\". Two men from another gun club, the Cavalier Rifle and Pistol Club of Richmond, Virginia, witnessed this match, and were very impressed. They convinced the club to invite the two teams to their range for a rematch. Rawls and Peterkin were eager to accept this invitation to this second \\"skirmish\\". The second skirmish witnessed the appearance of the first artillery. A mountain howitzer owned by the Confederates opened the event with a shot, and later fired three rounds for exhibition. The two teams also changed their names at this event, the Blue Bellies being renamed the Washington Blue Rifles, and the Long Rifles changed their name to the 1st Virginia Greys. Events at the second skirmish included an exploding cardboard fort, moving silhouettes, and more balloons. The crude scoring system gave the match win to the Virginia Greys, who were awarded blue ribbons and medals. One of the Blue Rifles, William B. Poland, won the individual event. The third skirmish was held at Camp Pendleton, Virginia in July 1951. Rawls and Peterkin held this event in conjunction with the last reunion of Confederate Veterans, which was attended by \\"General\\" John Salling of Slant, Virginia, and two other veterans. A parade was marched down the streets of Norfolk in blistering heat. Joining the Virginia Greys and Blue Rifles were two new teams, the 1st Richmond Rifles, and the Huron Rangers Riflemen who traveled from Detroit, MI to participate. These events, and the ones that followed, built the framework for the North-South Skirmish Association as it is today. Other Notable Events October 1956 - Formal adoption of a Constitution & By-Laws, First National Commander Elected. July 1958 - Incorporation of the association is completed. January 1961 - Timed scoring system adopted. July 1961 - 1st Manassas Reenactment, First of many U.S. Civil War Centennial Events, heavily attended and hosted by N-SSA member units.

Competition Arms Firearms used in N-SSA competition are restricted to those types documented to have been purchased by or issued to Federal or Confederate forces during the American Civil War. For an arm to qualify, there must be documentation supporting its issue to at least 100 troops, either in a regular branch of the military or in a state militia. Arms may be either original or replica. Arms not on the Approved Arms List N-SSA Approved Arms List require individual approval by the Small Arms Committee. Limited modifications may be made to firearms to improve performance. Triggers and locks may be tuned, sight heights may be changed, and barrels may be bedded. However, the general external profile and dimensions of arms must closely match those of original Civil War small arms. Six major types of small arms are used in N-SSA competition. Musket The standard infantry arm of the American Civil War was the rifle-Musket. These arms were muzzle-loading rifles firing the Minie ball. Major types of musket used by combatants during the Civil War were the Model 1861 and 1863 Springfield, as well as the British-made Pattern 1853 and 1858 Enfield. Although the long 'three-band' muskets (so called because they had three bands fastening the barrel to the stock) were the most widely issued, many N-SSA competitors favor the shorter 'two-band' muskets due to their superior balance and heavier barrels. As of 2015, an exciting new event, \\"Traditional Musket\\" has been added to the event list. Competitors firing in this event must use an as-issued rifle-Musket, with no modifications to stocks, locks, or bedding permitted. Competitors must also wear a full period-correct uniform to fire in these matches, and utilize only period-correct projectiles and paper cartridges. Carbine Carbines were issued to many cavalrymen from the 17th century until the 20th century. The American Civil War was notable for the use of carbines that were of markedly different design than the standard infantry weapon. Although short- barreled versions of the issue musket were used, breechloading designs such as the Sharps carbine and the Burnside carbine were more frequently encountered. The N-SSA groups muzzle-loading and breech-loading carbines together for competitive purposes. There is considerable debate about which design is the best. The advocates of muzzle-loading carbines argue that their arms are more accurate than most breechloaders, while the breechloader advocates argue that the superior rate of fire makes up for any loss of accuracy. Revolver Revolvers were issued to cavalrymen, artillery troops, and officers during the Civil War, which was one of the first conflicts to see such arms used in quantity. N-SSA revolver competition is limited to revolvers using percussion cap ignition. The major types of revolver used were the Colt Model 1851 and 1860, and the Remington Models of 1858 and 1863. There is also a single shot pistol competition for individual entry only (i.e. no team events). Breechloading Rifle The American Civil War was the first conflict in which firearms using self-contained cartridges were widely used. In the mid-1990s, the N-SSA added events for such arms to the competition schedule. Breechloading Rifles, as defined in N-SSA events, include the Henry Rifle and the Spencer Repeating Rifle. This is often referred to as the repeater match, given the ability of these weapons to hold more than one cartridge in its magazine.  Single Shot Rifle  In addition to the repeater match listed above, the N-SSA offers a category for single shot breechloading weapons. Both externally primed percussion weapons (mainly the Sharps 1859 rifle and rifle versions of the Maynard) as well as internally primed cartridge guns (such as the Ballard, Frank Wesson, and so on) are used. Smoothbore Musket Although the American Civil War is frequently thought of as a conflict fought with rifle-muskets, the older smoothbore muskets were commonly used during the first half of the war. The N-SSA instituted matches for smoothbore muskets in the 1990s. Current N-SSA rules require the use of a bare bullet, and prohibit the use of a patched round ball, as is permitted under MLAIC rules. Either flintlock or percussion cap muskets may be used in smoothbore musket competition. Shooting Competition The N-SSA holds numerous shooting competitions, known as Skirmishes, throughout the year. Skirmishes may be Invitational, sponsored by individual teams; Regional, sponsored by regions; or National, sponsored by the National organization. National Championship skirmishes are held twice yearly at the N-SSA home range near Winchester, Virginia in the months of May and October. The eastern part of the country is broken up into regions which hold their own regional skirmishes throughout the year, generally once or twice a month during the warmer months. Skirmishes feature both individual competitions and team competitions. Individual Competition Individual competitions are held with musket, revolver, carbine, repeater, single shot, single shot pistol, and smoothbore arms. Distances are 50 and with muskets, carbines, and repeaters; and 25 and with revolvers, single shot pistols, and smoothbore muskets. All individual matches are slow-fire precision events fired on standard N-SSA paper targets. The dimensions of these targets correspond closely to National Rifle Association targets for rifle and pistol. Individual matches at the National and most Regional Skirmishes are 10 shots for score with unlimited sighter shots, but some Regional and Invitational In addition to each individual match, there are several aggregate matches, including aggregates for each type of arm, as well as the Grand Aggregate of the musket, carbine, and revolver matches. Team Competition Team competitions are rapid-fire events fired against breakable targets. Teams may fire for up to five minutes (two minutes for revolver events) in each event, and a penalty assessed for every unhit target. The total time to complete all events is a team's score, with the team having the lowest total time winning. Musket Team Event The core of the North-South Skirmish Association is the musket team match. For both National and Regional matches, this competition consists of eight members. There are usually five events, one event at a distance of and four at a distance of . At the National, musket team events include: 32 clay pigeons on a cardboard backer, 16 hanging 4\\"x4\\" ceramic tiles, 16 hanging clay pigeons, and 16 hanging clay flower pots. The musket team event at a National is 10 hanging 6\\"x6\\" ceramic tiles. Regional musket matches are free to substitute other targets in place of the ones listed above. Other typical targets for the events are 12 ounce drink cans or 8 ounce styrofoam cups filled with water. Another typical target for the event would be 2 liter bottles filled with colored water. Carbine Team Event The second largest (next to the musket match) competition within the North-South Skirmish Association is the carbine team match. For the National matches, this competition consists of eight members, and targets are usually the same as musket team. Regional carbine matches quite often consist of five members, this is done to increase the number of teams competing since there are a smaller number of people attending. There are usually four or five events, one event at a distance of and three or four at a distance of . Revolver Team Event Revolver team events are quite popular in the N-SSA. Revolver teams consist of four shooters at the National matches, and usually three shooters at other Skirmishes. The normal target set for the revolver team match is: 1\\\\. Three clay pigeons on a cardboard backer per shooter 2\\\\. Two hanging clay pigeons per shooter 3\\\\. Two other hanging targets (wood blocks or clay pots) per shooter Breechloader, Single Shot, and Smoothbore Events Among the newest events to be added to the skirmish schedule, repeater, single shot, and smoothbore events consist anywhere from 3 members (at regional demonstration events) to 4 members (at official national match events). Targets are usually similar to other matches held during a skirmish. Artillery Team Event The most distinctive competition within the North- South Skirmish Association is the artillery team match, this match is broken down into mortar, rifled, smoothbore, and howitzer artillery. Mortar - range, 7 shots, fired at stake, scoring determined by distance measured to 5 closest hits to stake. Rifled Cannon - range, 1 Hour Limit, 12 shots, best 10 for score, fired at two paper targets, a bullseye, and a counter battery, scoring is determined by points system. Best score: 50-5V. Common rifled cannon included in this match are the 10pdr. Parrott, the 10pdr. Ordnance Rifle, and the James Rifle. Smoothbore Cannon - range, 1 Hour Limit, 12 shots, best 10 for score, fired at two paper targets, a bullseye, and a counter battery, scoring is determined by points system. Best score: 50-5V. Common smoothbore cannon include the 12pdr. Napoleon and the 6pdr. Smoothbore Field Gun. Home Range The N-SSA's headquarters and main range, known as Fort Shenandoah, are located on approximately of land approximately seven miles north of Winchester, Virginia. Facilities include a rifle range, a separate revolver range, and private camping. The main rifle range has a firing line over one- quarter mile (400 m) long, with room for nearly 600 competitors to shoot simultaneously. Shooting distance in this configuration is 50 and . The width of the range is employed, with a slanted firing line, to provide distances of up to for artillery and long-range rifle competition. This range is controlled from a single tower, and is one of the largest in the world. The revolver range has a firing line of approximately 250 positions. Distances available are for the entire line, and for approximately 25 positions. The full width of the revolver range is normally used only for revolver team competition. Member units are assigned campsites for their use throughout the year. Utilities are limited to central water and toilet facilities. Most competitors and their families spend skirmish weekends on the range - a particularly enjoyable experience during the prime camping seasons of late May (Spring Nationals) and early October (Fall Nationals). Planned activities for a typical skirmish weekend include children's programs, dances, cook-outs, and trips to \\"Sutler Row,\\" where vendors display and sell Civil War firearms, accoutrements, and clothing.

He had no prior experience in 6 miles, which did not appear on the New Zealand programme until 1948. Matthews credited his 1938 success to Lovelock. Matthews twice won the New Zealand national 3 miles title, in 1936 and 1938. He served in the Air Force in World War II, then moved to Auckland where he died.

Believers in backmasking think they can hear \\"Hail Satan\\" and other messages to Satan in some songs played in reverse, such as \\"Walk This Way\\" by Aerosmith. The variation Ave Satani, though grammatically incorrect, is sometimes used, likely originating from its use by Jerry Goldsmith in his theme music to The Omen. Some adherents to a traditional pagan faith (such as the musician Gaahl) have been known to use the phrase to mock Christians or Christianity, using the similarities between Satan as phallic and passionate and pagan fertility- gods such as Freyr in this rhetoric as a disambiguation.  Cultural history  The phrase \\"Hail Satan\\" is documented as early as 1808, where it is said in the poem The Monk of Cambray by an evil monk who uses his pact with Satan to advance in the ranks of the Catholic Church (and finally become Pope). The Latin version Ave Satanas (in its variant spelling Ave Sathanas), often appears in literature at least from the 1800s, notably in the popular 1895 faustian novel The Sorrows of Satan, and earlier in an 1862 play St. Clement's Eve (in reference to satanic undertakings supposed to take place at midnight in a district of Paris). After the phrase \\"Hail Satan\\" appeared in the 1967 book Rosemary's Baby by Ira Levin and the 1968 film adaptation of it, where it is said by Satanists when they believe Satan's will has been accomplished, and had also appeared in other films and in stock footage, the phrase became part of the common conception of what Satanists say. Some film actors were reluctant to say it, and of those who did some felt they experienced negative life events afterwards, such as divorce. Coinciding with its appearance in Rosemary's Baby, the phrase became a common greeting and ritual term in the Church of Satan (founded in 1966), both in its English form, Hail Satan, as well as in the Latin version of it, Ave Satanas. When Ave Satanas was used, it was often preceded by the term Rege Satanas (\\"Reign, Satan\\"). (Rege Satanas can be heard in the video of a widely publicized Church of Satan wedding performed by LaVey on February 1, 1967.Video of 1967 Church of Satan wedding.) The combination \\"Rege Satanas, Ave Satanas, Hail Satan!\\" is found as a greeting in early Church of Satan correspondence,Published in . as well as in their 1968 recording The Satanic Mass,LaVey, Anton, The Satanic Mass, LP (Murgenstrumm Records, 1968) and ultimately in their 1969 book The Satanic Bible. The same combination also appeared in 1969 in the non-Church of Satan record album by the rock band Coven, in a 13 minute long \\"Satanic Mass\\" of their own.On the album, Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls, LP (Dunwich Productions/Mercury Records, 1969) The use of \\"Hail Satan\\" by Coven (as well as their use of the sign of the horns and inverted crosses on the same album) was the first time this phrase was used in rock music. The phrase is used in some versions of the Black Mass, where it often accompanies the phrase \\"shemhamforash\\" and is said at the end of each prayer. This rite was performed by the Church of Satan appearing in the documentary Satanis in 1969. Some occultists accompany it with similar addresses to other gods or figures they revere. Rituals involving the phrase tend to be more likely to be mentioned in the press at Halloween. \\"Ave Satani\\", the theme song for The Omen (1976), written by Jerry Goldsmith, which won him an Academy Award, has a title which is intended to mean \\"Hail Satan\\" in Latin, in opposition to \\"Ave Christi\\". (The song contains other Latin phrases inverting Christ, such as \\"Ave Versus Christi\\", meaning \\"Hail Anti-Christ\\", and \\"Corpus Satani\\", an inversion of \\"Corpus Christi\\", the body of Christ). The song has been described as hair- raising and has inspired cover versions such as those by Fant√¥mas or Gregorian. The music is used in comic portrayals of stock \\"sinister\\" characters, for instance in the South Park episode \\"Woodland Critter Christmas\\", which involves devil-worshiping woodland creatures, a version of the \\"Ave Satani\\" is heard in the background when the animals use their demonic powers; also the episode's commercial bumpers involving a squirrel saying \\"Hail Satan!\\" The chant is also parodied in the episode \\"Damien\\", where Damien is accompanied by the chant \\"Rectus Dominus Cheesy Poofs.\\" In 1985, the phrase received national news coverage in the United States when serial killer Richard Ramirez, known as the \\"Night Stalker\\", shouted \\"Hail Satan!\\" as he was led from the courtroom, while raising his hand with a pentagram drawn onto it. Members of Ramirez's family denied that he said the phrase, believing that he said \\"We'll see,\\" but \\"Hail Satan\\" was still being used by journalists over twenty years later as being characteristic of Ramirez. In reviewing whether Ramirez was deprived of his due process and right to a fair trial by being restrained by leg shackles, the Supreme Court of California itself highlighted Ramirez's use of \\"Hail Satan\\" to support its conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Ramirez to be physically restrained during trial. The phrase may be used ironically by heavy metal fans as part of their rebellious ethos. Heavy metal musicians may use it as part of their act or their songs, such as \\"Hail Satanas We Are the Black Legions\\" by M√ºtiilation. Heavy metal musicians, for instance Ozzy Osbourne, a member of the Church of England, rarely consider themselves to be Satanists, instead using it as part of their stage persona, a role they play. RuPaul's Drag Race Season 4 Winner Sharon Needles has a song called Hail Satan, in which she cites icons from the satanic culture. John Darnielle, discussing the closing refrain of \\"Hail Satan\\" in the Mountain Goats song \\"The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton,\\" asserted that \\"if you believe in Satan, then you believe in God.\\" In an episode of the podcast I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats, Darnielle described recording this line: \\"The Hail Satan wasn‚Äôt written down; it was a spontaneous eruption [during recording], but it felt like a religious confession. Not obviously the dark principal that people talk about‚Ä¶ the Satan, John Milton‚Äôs Satan. That‚Äôs not what that means. It means a celebration of two people being true to themselves. It‚Äôs a celebration of that later satanic principal of self knowledge which isn‚Äôt really satanic at all, it‚Äôs actually God-like.\\" The ubiquity of the phrase has led to it being used in parodic imitation of evangelism, as with the Mr. Show with Bob and David sketch \\"Hail Satan Network\\" which includes characters who are Satanic televangelists. It received another humorous use when The Simpsons character Bart Simpson was punished for using it to end the Pledge of Allegiance in the episode \\"Burns' Heir\\".  Reputation  Some of those who believe in backmasking, along with some Christian fundamentalists, believe messages such as \\"Hail Satan\\" may subliminally inspire people to do evil, a view which may have received some reinforcement when the phrase was used as part of the vandalizing of churches, but its use then might have been the expression of a general anti-religious sentiment, as suggested by its use along with slogans such as \\"Think, don't Pray\\". Vandalism accompanying it may include the anarchy symbol or other slogans intended to shock, such as racial slurs. It can accompany symbols such as a swastika, inverted pentagram, or inverted cross. Such vandalism is usually by rebellious young people rather than Satanists, whose activities are not often criminal. Rick Alan Ross, an anti-cultist and deprogrammer, referred to the murder trial of Scott Peterson, in which the defense made the claim that the killings were by a \\"Satanic cult\\" rather than the defendant. Ross called this a ridiculous manifestation of the Satanic panic, referred to it as a \\"Hail Satan Pass\\", similar to the Hail Mary pass in football, a desperate and unlikely attempt.

It lies about half a mile (1km) to the west of the hamlet of St Lythans, near Dyffryn Gardens. It also lies around one mile (1.6 km) south of Tinkinswood burial chamber, a more extensive cromlech that it may once have resembled, constructed during the same period. The site is on pasture land, but pedestrian access is allowed and is free, with roadside parking available for 2‚Äì3 cars about 50 yards (50 metres) from the site. The dolmen, which has never been fully excavated, is maintained by Cadw, the Welsh Historic Environment Agency.  Location  The burial chamber stands in a field, Maesyfelin (The Mill Field), often shared by a herd of cows, to the south of St Lythans Road. Roadside parking is maintained by Cadw (to keep/protect), the Welsh Historic Environment Agency. Access to the field, which slopes gently downwards towards the north west, is permitted, and is free, via a kissing gate. There is no wheelchair access, although there is an uninterrupted view of the site from the gate, about 50 yards (50 metres) away.  Features  This chamber tomb is a dolmen, the most common form of megalithic structure in Europe. It stands at the eastern end of a flat topped, 27 metres (90 feet) long, wide earthen mound, forming part of a chambered long barrow. It is one of the Severn- Cotswold type, and consists of a cove of three upright stones (orthostats), supporting a large, flat, capstone. All the stones are mudstone, which, as with those used at Tinkinswood, were probably available locally. The capstone, which slopes downwards from south east to north west (the left side of the entrance towards the back, right), measures four metres (13 ft) long, three metres (10 ft) wide, and thick. The insides of the two facing, rectangular, uprights have been smoothed off and there is a port-hole at the top of the triangular, rear stone, similar to some other dolmens, such as at Trethevy Quoit, in Cornwall. The burial chamber has a minimum internal height of and is in an east/west alignment, with the entrance facing east. As with most cromlechs, it is likely that originally, the burial chamber would have had a forecourt immediately outside the entrance to the chamber and the chamber would have been covered by a mound of earth and smaller stones. This has either been eroded, or removed, over time, leaving only a much lower barrow behind the current structure. However, as the chamber is unusually tall, it is possible that the capstone was never fully covered.  History   Prehistoric origins  From the end of the last ice age (between 10,000 and 12,000 BP), mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. They would have been able to walk between Continental Europe and Great Britain on dry land, prior to the post glacial rise in sea level, up until between 6,000 and 7,000 BP. As the area was heavily wooded and movement would have been restricted, it is likely that people also came to what was to become known as Wales by boat from the Iberian Peninsula. These neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers. They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land. They built the long barrow at St Lythans around 6,000 BP, about 1,500 years before either Stonehenge or The Egyptian Great Pyramid of Giza was completed. There are over 150 other cromlechs all over Wales, such as Pentre Ifan in Pembrokeshire () and Bryn Celli Ddu, on Anglesey (), of the same period.  Purpose  St Lythans burial chamber, from the south west As well as places to house and to honour the dead, these cromlechs may have been communal and ceremonial sites where, according to Dr Francis Pryor, people would meet \\"to socialise, to meet new partners, to acquire fresh livestock and to exchange ceremonial gifts\\". The corpses of the dead were probably left exposed, before the bones were moved into the burial chamber.  New cultures  In common with the people living all over Great Britain, over the following centuries the people living around what is now known as St Lythans assimilated new immigrants and exchanged ideas of the Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Together with the approximate areas now known as Brecknockshire, Monmouthshire and the rest of Glamorgan, St Lythans was settled by a Celtic British tribe called the Silures. Although the Roman occupation left no physical impression on St Lythans, its people embraced the Roman religion of Christianity and dedicated a church to St Bleddian, who had been sent to Britain to stamp out the Pelagian Heresy. The current Church of St Bleddian, in St Lythans, a listed grade II* building, known locally as St Lythan's Church, was built about ‚Öî mile (about 1 km) to the east of this site and has an ancient yew tree in the churchyard.  Recent local history  St Lythans Church In the 16th century, the manor was acquired by the Button family, who built the first house about north west of the tumulus. The Manor's name was changed to Dyffryn St Nicholas and the house rebuilt in the 18th century, when the estate was purchased by Thomas Pryce. Commenting on St Lythans in his 'A Topographical Dictionary of The Dominion of Wales', London, 1811, Nicholas Carlisle, says \\"The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 72. It is 6m. W. S.W. from Caerdiff (sic).\\" and notes that \\"Here is a Druidical Altar.\\" By 1831 the population had grown by over 50% (\\"Lythan's, St. (St. Lythian), a parish in the hundred of Dinas-Powis, county of Glamorgan, South Wales, 6 miles (W. S. W.) from Cardiff, containing 103 inhabitants.\\") and Dyffryn House was being used as \\"a school for all the poor children of this parish\\". By now, the dolmen had been correctly identified: \\"There is a cromlech on St. Lythan's common.\\" (From 'A Topographical Dictionary of Wales' by Samuel Lewis, 1833). Census records show that St Lythans' population fluctuated between 81 (1881) and 136 (1861) over the rest of the 19th century. In 1939, the Dyffryn Estate was leased to the Glamorgan County Council for 999 years.  Local folklore  St Lythans Burial Chamber is also known as Gw√¢l y Filiast () ‚Äî the site had been used as an animal shelter in the early 19th century ‚Äì and Maes y Felin (The Mill Field), apparently from the legend that, each Midsummer's Eve, the capstone spins around three times and all the stones go to the nearby river to bathe. The cromlech stands in a field known as the \\"Accursed Field\\", so called due to its supposed infertility. However, Julian Cope (born about to the north, in Deri, Caerphilly) has suggested the name may have derived from \\"Field O'Koeur\\". The name could be a variant of the Arthurian legend of Culhwch and Olwen, which appears in two fourteenth-century Welsh texts, but the site itself is very much older dating from the Neolithic period, some 5,000 to 6,000 years ago.  Analysis of contemporary local sites  Few human remains survive from this period, the early Neolithic (c 6400 BP‚Äì5300 BP), although they are comparatively well preserved in the Black Mountains, Gower and the Vale of Glamorgan, where up to 50 individuals, of all ages, have been interred ‚Äî men, women and children ‚Äî in each cromlech. Minor excavation was carried out at St Lythans by William Collings Lukis in 1875. However his notes are regarded as \\"poorly-recorded\\". A report noted in 1976 that \\"Human remains and coarse pottery were found in 1875 in the debris thrown out from the interior, which partly fills the hollow of the original forecourt in the E (sic) end of the mound.\\" Some surface finds from the cromlech are held in the St Fagans National History Museum, Cardiff. They are a fine leaf-shaped flint arrowhead, a fragment of polished stone axe and several flight flakes. Conservation work was carried out on the eroded barrow in 1992‚Äì93, when soil and turfs were replaced to cover the exposed areas. The St Lythans site has not yet been fully excavated. However, results from excavations of other sites are worth noting:  Parc Cwm long cairn  Musculoskeletal analysis of the human remains found at Parc Cwm long cairn (), Gower, has shown significant gender lifestyle variation. Male muscular development is greater ‚Äî possibly from hunting or herding. In contrast, no such variation was noticeable in the remains found during the excavation from the nearby Tinkinswood burial chamber.History of Wales, 25,000 BC AD 2000, Prys Morgan (Ed), 2001, Tempus, , p 20  Goldsland Wood  Remains from seven neolithic humans have been excavated from a cave at Goldsland Wood, Wenvoe, near the cromlech at St Lythans, together with pottery and flint blades dating from between 5,000 to 5,600 BP. Although there is no evidence to show that the bones relate to the site, it is thought that the corpses had been placed there until they had decomposed. The skeletons would then have been removed to sites such as the St Lythans Burial Chamber or the Tinkinswood Burial Chamber. This appears to be the sole site found in Britain where corpses have been left to rot prior to placement in communal tombs. Most of the remains recovered were small pieces of jaw, fingers or toes. The Tinkinswood site contained human remains and pottery dating to the early Bronze Age, showing that such sites were used over many generations.

She was used as a weather-gathering ship, a patrol craft and convoy escort vessel in the North Atlantic Ocean. Although a Navy ship, she was operated by the U.S. Coast Guard, and eventually was transferred to that agency as USCGC Menemsha (WAG-274).  Built in Duluth, Minnesota Menemsha (AG-39) was built as Lake Orange by McDougall Duluth Co., Duluth, Minnesota, in 1918; purchased as John Gehm by the Maritime Commission from her owners, Bison Steamship Corp., Buffalo, New York, in 1941; acquired by the Navy 19 September 1941; renamed Menemsha and classified AG-39 on 15 October 1941; converted from a lake cargo hauler to a weather patrol ship by Maryland Drydock Company. Baltimore, Maryland; and commissioned under loan to the U.S. Coast Guard 20 January 1942. World War II service  Assigned to duty with the North Atlantic Weather Patrol, Menemsha patrolled various at sea weather stations out of Boston, Massachusetts, and Argentia, Newfoundland. Averaging about 3 weeks a patrol, she braved the perils of the storm tossed North Atlantic Ocean and the menace of German U-boats to gather valuable weather data from her isolated positions. In addition, Menemsha maintained a constant alert for the enemy undersea raiders as well as for survivors from torpedoed ships. While patrolling south of Newfoundland 20 August 1942, she rescued the only five survivors from the British merchant ship Arletta, torpedoed by on 4 August while a straggler from Convoy ON-115. Menemsha returned the survivors to Boston 25 August. Almost 1 year later, Menemsha, on a weather patrol, sighted a German submarine. As she steamed about midway between the Virginia Capes and the Azores on the moonlit night of 11 August 1943, her lookout spotted a surfaced sub, , about 6,000 yards off her starboard bow. She closed for attack and began shelling the U-boat with 4 inch gunfire. During the next half-hour she chased the enemy which responded with \\"incoherent recognition signals\\" rather than with torpedoes or return fire. The determined weather patrol ship fired 20 rounds, one of which struck close aboard the fleeing sub's conning tower. Menemsha broke off attack after suspecting the presence of other enemy U-boats in the area. She rendezvoused with a hunter killer group, headed by , at noon the 12th; however, patrolling aircraft and escorting destroyers failed to flush U-760, who interned herself on the Spanish coast 8 September. Transfer to the U.S. Coast Guard The Navy transferred Menemsha to the Coast Guard 22 October 1943 and she was commissioned as USCGC Menemsha (WAG 274). Her name was struck from the Navy List 30 October 1943. After long and valuable service in the Coast Guard, she was scrapped in 1951.
