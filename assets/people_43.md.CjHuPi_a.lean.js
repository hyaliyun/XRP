History  Pm3-5 as Pm3-3 with a 32D3-3 tender The DRG's Class 03.10 engines were an evolutionary development from the Class 03 locomotives, comparable to those of Class 01.10 which had evolved from Class 01. The first 03.10 was built in 1939 and 140 units were to be manufactured. As a result of the Second World War and the switching of production to 'war essential' goods, only 60 vehicles were completed. Originally supplied with the 2'2 T38St standard tenders, the 03.10 could later be encountered coupled to 2'2'T34 tenders. The locomotives were mainly produced by the firms of Borsig, Krupp and Krauss-Maffei, and were fully enclosed by streamlining plates. The vehicles were given the operating numbers 03 1001 ‚Äì 1022, 03 1043‚Äì1060 and 03 1073 ‚Äì 1092. After the war, 47 locomotives remained in Germany; 26 were taken over by the Deutsche Bundesbahn and 21 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany. Ten other locomotives ended up with the Polish State Railways (PKP) as the Pm3. Two engines (03 1091 and 1092) had to be retired as early as 1944 due to war damage. The fate of 03 1002 is unknown. Because the top speed on main lines had to be reduced due to route damage, the streamlined shells became uneconomical, not least because they made maintenance more difficult, and they were removed from all the engines except the DR's 03 1087. Almost all the DR and DB locomotives were rebuilt. Only 03 1047, 1097 and 1086 (DR) had been retired before the reconstruction programme.Dampflokomotiven deutscher Eisenbahnen Baureihe 01-39  The East German DR Rekoloks  The condition of the boilers became worse and worse due to the use of non-aging St47K steel (on 10 October 1958 the boiler of locomotive 03 1046 exploded as a result of aging). So the Deutsche Reichsbahn had to replace them with newly designed boilers. In addition, several other components were overhauled in order to make the engines more economical. Thus the term Rekolok ('reconstructed locomotive') is entirely accurate. A total of 16 engines were rebuilt in 1959. In 1952, 03 1087 was converted to the Wendler brown coal dust firing system. Because this type of firing was unsuccessful for passenger train services, it was re-converted in 1959. From 1965 all the Rekoloks were converted to oil-firing (with the exception of 03 1057 and 1087). Until their retirement at the end of the 1970s the three-cylinder express train engines, which covered up to 22,000 km per month, were the spearhead of the DR's high-value express train services. Number 03 1010 is a museum locomotive with the DB AG, stationed in Halle and frequently used in heritage services. It was re-converted to coal-firing. The non-operational, oil-fired 03 1090 is also preserved and is housed in the former locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw) at Schwerin.

The streamlined shells on all the locomotives were removed, mainly due to their poor condition. Externally, these engines can still be distinguished from the Class 03 by their still-recognisable steam dome, their cut-down smokebox door, the flat Erhebung of the superheater regulator, the air reservoirs, the missing front skirt, and the shape of the driver's cab and tender. The locomotives were stationed in Dortmund, Ludwigshafen and Offenburg after their refurbishment. The three engines stabled at the locomotive depot or Bw Dortmund, numbers 03 1014, 03 1022 and 03 1043, were given a special steel blue livery in June 1950 for their boilers, cabs, and cylinder blocks. The smokebox and chimney remained painted black. In 1952, the feedwater preheater was moved back to the area of the chimney on most of the locomotives and a circular smokebox door fitted. At the general inspection in 1954, 03 1014, 03 1022 and 03 1043 lost their steel blue livery again. Because major signs of aging appeared on the boilers, the firm of Krupp was given the task of replacing them with welded boilers which had a combustion chamber. In addition the locomotives were given newly designed tenders with covers and supply equipment. Both were installed in the repair shop (Ausbesserungswerk or AW) in Brunswick between 1957 and 1961. In autumn 1958, all 26 engines were rehomed to Bw Hagen-Eckesey, after some had previously been based in Hamburg- Altona and Paderborn. These were numbers 03 1001, 1004, 1008, 1009, 1011‚Äì1014, 1016, 1017, 1021, 1022, 1043, 1045, 1049‚Äì1051, 1054‚Äì1056, 1060, 1073, 1076, 1081, 1082 and 1084. Between November 1965 and September 1966, all Class 03.10 locomotives were withdrawn, retired and scrapped.  Surviving locomotives  The former no. 03 1010 is a museum locomotive retained as part of the DB fleet. It is homed in the former railway depot of Halle P (DB Museum, Halle (Saale)), maintained by the Railway Social Work Foundation (BSW) Group, Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P BSW, and supported financially by the Society for the Preservation of Schnellzugdampflok 03 1010 Following its main inspection in 2011 by the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works, they use it to haul railway specials throughout Germany.eisenbahn-magazin 1/2012, p. 19 The non-operational, oil-fired no. 03 1090 has also been preserved as a museum locomotive.

On 17 October 1709 Capt. Galfridus Walpole, the youngest son of Sir Robert Walpole, was appointed captain of LION (50 cannons). He maintained that post till 1714. On 22 March 1711, Lion was with other Royal Navy vessels in Vado Bay on the Italian coast when four French enemy ships were sighted. She and others gave chase and engaged the enemy for about two hours. Forty of Lions crew were killed, and Walpole was so badly injured that his right arm was amputated by the ship's surgeon John Atkins. Walpole's sword from the time of this engagement was subsequently gifted to a young Horatio Nelson and was still in his possession when he too lost his right arm in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife on 15 July 1797. In September 1712, together with , and HMS Superb, assisted Admiral John Jennings with landing troops at Barcelona. On 9 December 1735 orders were issued for Lion to be dismantled and rebuilt according to the 1733 proposals of the 1719 Establishment at Deptford, from where she was relaunched on 25 April 1738. Sir Peircy BrettDuring the Jacobite rising she saw action on the 9 July 1745, when she exchanged fire with the French ships Elizabeth and the Du Teillay.http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11856.html National Maritime Museum The Lion is described as 58 guns with a crew of 400. The Du Teillay at the time was carrying Charles Edward Stuart to Scotland with supplies and funds to support his cause. Prince Charles had boarded the French ship on 7 July at Saint-Nazaire bound for Ardmolich, they were joined by a French escort ship the ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô (L'Elisabeth). Two days later they were intercepted by the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô, commanded by Captain Piercy Brett. A close action began at 17.00 between the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô and ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô, with the ‚ÄòDu Teillay‚Äô attacking the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô several times and, at 18.00, the ‚ÄòLion‚Äôs‚Äô mizzen topmast came down. By 20.00, The ‚ÄòLion‚Äô with her mizzen top and topmast shot away and hanging over the side was still in close action with the ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô. The ‚ÄòDu Teillay‚Äô shielded by the Elizabeth continued firing at the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô who returned fire with her stern guns. The ‚ÄòLion‚Äô continued firing at the ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô until the latter broke free at 22.00 to join the ‚ÄòDu Teillay‚Äô; by this time the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô was too damaged to follow (she had also taken extensive damage to the hull); with 45 of her men dead and about 107 wounded. The ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô had lost about 57 men with 175 wounded, her commander, Captain Dau, among the dead. On 2 August 1745, the Du Teillay landed Charles Stuart at Eriskay, and then onto Loch nan Uamh, Scotland, before returning to France. Captain Brett who was wounded in the battle was obliged to have the Captain of the Marines arrested for skulking on the poop under cover some bags, setting such a bad example that it encouraged most of his men to do likewise.Dominic Serres painted a version of the event in 1860, from three drawings done at the time by Peircy Brett. In April 1747 Lion was part of a small squadron under the overall command of Thomas Fox on HMS Kent, consisting of HMS Hampton Court, HMS Eagle, HMS Chester, HMS Hector, and two fireships. They cruised between Ushant and Cape Finisterre in an attempt to intercept a large merchant fleet that was sailing from San Domingo to France. After a month at sea they encountered the convoy, which consisted of some 170 ships carrying a cargo of cochineal, cotton, indigo and other valuable commodities. They were escorted by four French warships, who fled upon the approach of the British fleet. Fox's squadron captured 46 merchants, and dispersed the rest. Some were later captured by smaller British warships operating in the area. In January 1748 Charles Watson (Royal Navy officer) was appointed commander-in-chief of the Newfoundland and North American station with his flag in HMS Lion. The Lion continued in service until 1765, when she was sold out of the navy.

His first wife, Valentina, is claimed to have lived to be 76 and, between 1725 and 1765, have had 69 children (16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets and 4 sets of quadruplets); 67 of them survived infancy with the loss of one set of twins: the record for most children born to a single woman. However their name, date of birth, and date of death are all unknown. Vassilyev also had 18 children with his second wife, who had 6 pairs of twins and 2 sets of triplets, making him a father of 87 children in total. Of his 87 children, at least 82 are said to have survived infancy. The data about Vassilyev's children are included in the Guinness Book of World Records. Source The first published account about Feodor Vassilyev's children appeared in a 1783 issue of The Gentleman's Magazine (Vol. 53 p. 753, London, 1783) and states that the information \\"however astonishing, may be depended upon, as it came directly from an English merchant in St Petersburg to his relatives in England, who added that the peasant was to be introduced to the Empress\\". The same numbers were given in Ivan Nikitich Boltin's 1788 commentary on Russian history and in an 1834 book by Alexander Pavlovich Bashutskiy, Saint Petersburg Panorama. Skepticism Several published sources raised doubts as to the veracity of these claims. According to a 1933 article by Julia Bell in Biometrika, a 1790 book of B. F. J. Hermann Statistische Schilderung von Ru√üland did provide the claims about Feodor Vassilyev's children but \\"with a caution\\". Bell also notes that the case was reported by The Lancet in an 1878 article about the study of twins. The Lancet article states that the French Academy of Sciences attempted to verify the claims about Vassilyev's children and contacted \\"M. Khanikoff of the Imperial Academy of St Petersburg for advice as to the means they should pursue, but were told by him that all investigation was superfluous, that members of the family still lived in Moscow and that they had been the object of favors from the Government\\". Bell concludes that Vassilyev's case \\"must be regarded as under suspicion\\". Similarly, Marie Clay in a 1998 book notes: \\"Sadly, this evasion of proper investigation seems, in retrospect, to have dealt a terminal blow to our chances of ever establishing the true detail of this extraordinary case\\".

It fundraises through events including corporate golf days, sporting dinners and wine tasting evenings, although also relies heavily on the generosity of individuals and charitable trusts alike. Leeds Society for Deaf and Blind People remains focused at all times on achieving better outcomes for vulnerable people and contributing to improving the wellbeing of all citizens of Leeds, by responding to need wherever possible and developing partnerships whenever they present themselves in every area of their work. History In 1866, the Vicar of Leeds, Revd D. R. Atley, convened a public meeting to form Leeds United Institution for the Blind and the Deaf and Dumb LUIBDD sourced from Leeds Directory-Post Office- Year 1882 Part One Page26 @ Leeds General Library(later renamed Leeds Incorporated Institution for the Blind and the Deaf and Dumb). A public appeal was launched in 1873 by the Mayor of Leeds, Mr H. R. Marsden, for funds for premises which led to the Albion Street premises being opened in 1876. The new building incorporated workshops for blind people, a service chapel for deaf people and areas for socialising. (Located at the site of corner of Albion Street (westside) and St Anne's Street (northside). This site has demolished in early 1970s, had been since undergo redevelopment, recently been converted of the present K2 building of luxury apartments.) In 1917 the organisation became a registered charity and its Memorandum and Articles of Association were approved. In 1976, following the purchase of the former Leeds Public Dispensary, Centenary House was officially opened by H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh on 13 February. More recently, in 1996 the name of the Society changed to Leeds Society for Deaf and Blind People. In 2004 Shire View Resource Centre for Visually Impaired People was welcomed under the banner of the Society. In 2008, Leeds Society for Deaf and Blind People took over the management of the city‚Äôs only braille and large print unit from Leeds City Council.

Career history After being unbeaten in 5 bouts (4 wins and a draw), Shingaki challenged Dodie Boy Penalosa for the vacant IBF light flyweight title on December 10, 1983. Unfortunate for him, he was knocked out in 12 rounds and met his first setback. Following a win since losing to Penalosa, Shingaki got another world title shot on April 15, 1984. There, he fought Elmer Magallano for the vacant IBF bantamweight championship and won by TKO in the 8th round. He defended it against Joves De La Puz, three months and twenty days later. On his second defense, Shingaki fought Australia's Jeff Fenech on 26 April 1985 at the Horden Pavilion in Sydney. The Japanese champion lost title as he was stopped in the 9th round. They met again on August 23 in the same year at the State Sports Centre, again in Sydney where once more, Shingaki was beaten, this time in 3 rounds. Fenech connected with a hard right 30 seconds into the first which had blood coming from Shingaki's nose. In the 2nd Fenech again connected and opened up a bad cut above his opponents right eye. In true Japanese tradition Shingaki never gave up but the fight was stopped after 3 rounds after he was ruled unfit to continue. Shingaki, despite his injury was keen to continue, even shaping up showing he was willing to go on, but the doctor and referee wouldn't budge and the fight was over. He won his last 3 matches and quit boxing permanently.

In order to achieve this aim, an enormous state apparatus has devised a sophisticated system of surveillance, subtle forms of re-education and, if necessary, brainwashing.

Waste dumping attracted black bears and timber wolves to the region. According to a trucker who said he met Carnegie in the cafeteria a few days before his death, he had passed around close-range photographs of large wolf pups that had approached him during walks in nearby woods, and been warned by the trucker that such encounters were extremely dangerous. A bush pilot said he warned Carnegie about an incident in which adult wolves had menaced others walking outside the camp, but Carnegie's family said he would not have taken risks if warned. After reviewing evidence, which included wolf tracks left around the body, the finding of a coroner's inquest was that Carnegie had been killed by wolves. If true, this would make his death one of the first verified cases of a fatal wild wolf attack in North America. Fatal attack=Background Points North Landing in the province of Saskatchewan is a service centre for uranium mines. Timber wolves and black bears fed on camp refuse and were seen nearby.Boyd, Diane K. \\"(Case Study) Wolf Habituation as a Conservation Conundrum\\". In: Groom, M. J. et al (n.d.) Principles of Conservation Biology, 3rd ed., Sinauer Associates. Ten months prior to Carnegie's death, a lone wolf attacked a fifty-five-year-old uranium miner named Fred Desjarlais who was jogging home from work in Key Lake. He wrestled with it until a busload of his colleagues arrived to rescue him by frightening the wolf away. They subsequently took Desjarlais to a nearby medical facility. A few hours later, Key Lake Airport's medical workers airlifted Desjarlais to Saskatoon's Royal University Hospital where he had a series of rabies treatments. After the assault on Desjarlais, Cameco built an electric fence around Key Lake's landfill to prevent further predatory animal assaults on miners. Authorities hunted and shot the wolf that attacked Desjarlais. They tested the wolf's body for rabies, but the test was negative. On 4 November 2005, one naturalist who reviewed photographs taken during an incident in which wolves that were supposed to have menaced two walkers other than Carnegie, said it appeared to be consistent with animals having a food- conditioned lack of fear in proximity to humans.A Review of Evidence and Findings Related to the Death of Kenton Carnegie on 8 November 2005 Near Points North, Saskatchewan by Mark E. McNay, Alaska Department of Fish and Game Fairbanks, Alaska, 25 May 2007 It was suggested that one wolf's posture indicated it was aroused and capable of an attack. Another expert disputed the characterisation of the wolf's attitude. The site in Points North Landing, Saskatchewan where Carnegie's body was discovered. Death Carnegie was on his autumn cooperative term in his third year of geological engineering at University of Waterloo. He and a colleague were in the Athabasca basin performing airborne surveying work for Ottawa-based Sander Geophysics. Carnegie told colleagues he was going for a walk. According to official statements made to RCMP, he was \\"implored\\" not to go.Svarckopf, Todd. 15 March 2006. \\"Statement #2 to the RCMP (Corporal Marion), phone interview from St. John‚Äôs Newfoundland.\\" Audio transcribed. His family say that Carnegie was known to be interested in the geology around the lake, and he was given permission. On 8 November at 5:30 P.M., Carnegie left, saying to his geophysicist Chris Van Galder that he would return by 7:00 for supper. His bush pilot Todd Svarckopf warned him to not walk in the snow and play hockey in the airport's hangar instead, but Carnegie disregarded the warning. He went for a walk in the snow, but did not return to the surveyor camp. At 7:30, a search was mounted. The camp's co-owner Mark Eikel drove out in a truck with Van Galder and Svarckopf searching for him. Carnegie's tracks were followed to the lake shore. On noticing wolf tracks on the shore, the three searchers went back for a rifle before continuing. Carnegie's body was found a little further on, but there were no wolves in sight at that time. Using a flashlight, the body was viewed from about 10 m (32 ft), and many wolf tracks were visible around the body. Later, when the body was being recovered, two sets of eyes were seen glowing in the dark close by. In addition, party searchers heard a wolf pack howling around the camp's vicinity.\\"Death of a Student in Northern Saskatchewan Caused by a Wolf ‚Äì Reality or Fiction?\\" Fourth International Symposium on Canids. Behaviour and Conservation. A challenge to Mankind‚Äôs Tolerance. 31 October 2008 Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.Re: Review of evidence pertaining to the death of Kenton Carnegie, Brent Patterson, Trent University, Wildlife Research & Development Section Rosalie Tsannie-Burseth, the province's local coroner who had arranged the removal of Carnegie's body, gave a hypothetical reconstruction of what happened. Her reconstruction was based on tracks of people and animals she observed near the site of the attack the day after the event occurred. She speculated that Carnegie had walked from the camp and by the time he was a kilometer away a wolf began following his tracks. One wolf stalked Carnegie from the forest and another wolf stalked him from the lake. Boot prints in the snow showed that Carnegie quickened his pace, as two more wolves approached him from the sides. The first apparent struggle occurred 2.2 metres (7 ft) from where the chase began. Four more scuffle sites were found leading to where his body was discovered. Tsannie- Burseth believed that Carnegie probably fought hard before finally succumbing. Before Carnegie's death, there had been at least one verified case of a fatal wolf attack on a person in North America, namely Canada, where Patricia Wyman died on 18 April 1996. More than 300 occurrences of black bears behaving aggressively toward humans have been documented in the province, including three fatal attacks. The main evidence against a bear attack was that Carnegie's body was surrounded by the tracks of wolves, while no bear tracks were found near his body. Carnegie's interment was at Thornton Cemetery in Oshawa, Ontario.Canadian Obituary and Death Notice Archive Official investigation The RCMP determined that Kenton Carnegie's death was not the result of a homicide. The official Government of Saskatchewan investigation was headed by internationally renowned carnivore biologist and behavioral ecologist Dr. Paul Paquet and RCMP forensic anthropologist Dr. Ernest Walker, who oversaw Carnegie's autopsy, which was performed by Dr. N. Brits in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Brits stated that Carnegie's injuries were consistent with those expected in a predatory animal attack. Paquet and Walker concluded that the only likely candidates were wolves and black bears, as coyotes, grizzly bears, and pumas were not known to frequent the Points North Landing area. The report, however, was equivocal as to which predator was responsible, noting that most of the evidence, all of which was circumstantial, was unavoidably confounded by search and recovery efforts. Conservation Officers who investigated the accident site two days after the event and several snowfalls, wrote in their report \\"Officers investigated the site and found numerous wolf tracks in the area. No other large animal tracks could be found.\\" Bears had not been sighted at Points North Camp for over a month, and the death occurred during what some suggest is their annual hibernation cycle.Review of Investigative Findings Relating to the Death of Kenton Carnegie at Points North, Saskatchewan by Dr. Paul Paquet, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, and Dr. Ernest G. Walker, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 8 August 2008'McRory, W. 2006. (Confidential) Review of carnivore factors as the cause of the fatality of a 22 year old man in Northern Saskatchewan on 8 November 2005; on behalf of Dr. P. Paquet for Coroner‚Äôs report. Other opinion It is unusual for wolves, and typical for bears, to drag the carcass of a prey animal in the way Carnegie's body was dragged. Among the photographed injuries present on the body, was a bite mark on the right side of Carnegie's right calf/shin which some authorities considered consistent with the wolf bite marks researchers commonly observe on ungulate prey carcasses. Paquet and Walker identified the mark as occurring post mortem and indistinguishable from those left by black bears. A naturalist retained by the Carnegie family reviewed accounts of 80 events in Alaska and Canada where wolves closely approached or attacked people, found 39 cases of aggression by apparently healthy wolves, and 29 cases of fearless behavior by non-aggressive wolves. After examining photographs of Carnegie's body and the area around it, a naturalist concluded that the argument in favour of a bear culprit was weak: many black bears may have been hibernating, an active bear would have concentrated on an ample food supply from the nearby landfill 2 km from the kill site, and none of the camp employees saw bears or bear tracks, either the month before or after the attack occurred. A bruise on Carnegie's right lower leg (measured 4 √ó 2.5 cm), with what appeared to be bite mark impressions associated with the bruising was said to be consistent with injuries observed in 13 survivors of wolf attacks in Alaska and Canada. In many of these cases, the initial bites were fleeting and occurred in the hands or legs, and left only torn clothing, scratched skin, or minor puncture wounds. A photo, featuring the injured lower back of a six-year-old Alaskan boy attacked by a wolf near Icy Bay showed bite marks ¬Ω-3 cm in length; many of which were similar to those found near the nose, eyes, and right arm of Carnegie's body. However, as Carnegie was their first human victim, it would have been impossible to extrapolate normal, specific feeding behaviours. A reconstruction of the attack suggested that Carnegie repeatedly broke free and struggled to his feet after being taken down. Bears are adept at pinning prey. Inquest The Chief Coroner's confidential investigative report was completed in the summer of 2006 and given to the Carnegie family for review. The report determined Carnegie was killed by either wolves or a black bear, and that the poorly conducted initial investigation and uncertainty of circumstantial evidence precluded a definitive conclusion. An Inquest date of February 2007 was then called by the Chief Coroner, but was rescheduled for 29 October 2007. The Province of Saskatchewan chose not to present an affirmative case supporting the findings of the Chief Coroner. Accordingly, the lawyer representing the crown did not carry out in depth examinations of witnesses. Further, judicial inquests in Saskatchewan apply a much lower standard for determining cause of death (balance of probabilities or 51%) than do determinations by the Chief Coroner (reasonable doubt or 95%). On 1 November 2007, following three days of testimony and examination of photographs of Carnegie's body and the site of the incident, a six-member jury concluded that wolves were responsible for Carnegie's death. Aftermath A scholarship fund at the University of Waterloo was established as a memorial.Kenton Joel Carnegie Memorial retrieved 27/8/14 Dr. L. David Mech, an internationally recognized wolf expert, stated; \\"Mr. Carnegie's death is a terrible tragedy but one fatal wolf attack in the recorded history of North America does not warrant widespread alarm\\".Wolves at the Door by Moira Farr, Explore Magazine, March 2006 According to Carnegie's family, the official investigation was too focused on establishing Carnegie's cause of death, while ignoring wider policy issues. Further criticism concerned an alleged failure of some biologists to notice that an unnatural garbage-scavenging lifestyle meant wolves around the camp had flourished only to the extent they lacked fear of humans, and a proliferation of wolves thus selected was depleting the local deer population. Carnegie's father expressed concern that Saskatchewan's response was inadequate and that there was no real action being taken to tackle the circumstances which he believed had led to the attack. After Carnegie's death, an electric fence was built around Points North Landing's landfill to prevent future predatory animal incidents. Eleven years later, a lone timber wolf attacked a young male twenty-six-year-old worker in Cigar Lake. The worker was on his midnight break when it jumped and mauled him less than 100 meters from the main camp. A nearby female security guard frightened the wolf away. She administered first aid and called for an air ambulance, which airlifted him 675 kilometres to a hospital in Saskatoon, where he recovered. After the attack, authorities ordered that wolves in the area be tracked down and shot. In addition, authorities required food disposal systems and inspected the fence around Cigar Lake's landfill, as well as providing more education to the mining staff members. Five years later, a small pack of wolves in Chignik, Alaska fatally attacked a young American woman. The CBC put trapper Harold R. Johnson book Cry Wolf, partially inspired by Carnegie's death, on its 2020 spring reading list.

It is a perennial herbaceous riverbed plant native to India's Madhya Pradesh state. It is one of the most invasive weeds known, having spread out to a world-wide distribution in tropical and temperate regions. The plant is mentioned in the ancient Ayurvedic medicine text Charaka Samhita, and is used extensively in Chinese medicine and traditional perfuming. Distribution Cyperus scariosus is a highly invasive pestilent, and as such can be found in all tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world. In India, it is common in open, disturbed habitats to an elevation of about 1800 m.Parotta, JA. Healing Plants of Peninsular India. New York: CABI Publishing; 2001. p. 02-66. Botanical description Cyperus scariosus is a perennial slender herb, stem at base nodosely thickened and suddenly constricted into a wiry rhizome, sub solitary, triquetrous at top. Leaves long, often overlapping stem. Flowers borne in compound umbel, spikes loosely spicate of 3-8 spixelets. Seeds in the form of trigonous nuts, flowers and fruits almost throughout the year, but chiefly during rainy season.Chatterjee A, Pakrashi SC. The Treatise on Indian Medicinal Plants. Vol.VI. New Delhi: National Institute of Science Communication (CSIR); 2009. p. 809-1250. Uses Ayurvedic physicians use the plant for medicinal purposes for fevers, digestive system disorders, dysmenorrhea and other maladies. Modern alternative medicine recommends using the plant to treat nausea, fever and inflammation; for pain reduction; for muscle relaxation and for many other disorders.http://www.ijnpnd.com/article.asp?issn=2231-0738;year=2014;volume=4;issue=1;spage=23;epage=27;aulast=Imam The essential oil from the tuber has a deep, spicy woody-earthy smell, is highly prized in India and is used extensively as a raw ingredient in perfumery, aromatherapy and soap making. Chemical constituents Steam distillation of the tubers of cypriol yields 0.035‚Äì0.040% of an essential oil, the principal content of which is cyperene.

Career Brooks holds a PhD in Quantum Physics from the University of Sussex. He was previously an editor for New Scientist magazine, and currently works as a consultant for that magazine. His writing has appeared in The Guardian, The Independent, The Observer, The Times Higher Education Supplement, and Playboy. His first novel, Entanglement, was published in 2007. His first non-fiction book, an exploration of scientific anomalies entitled 13 Things That Don't Make Sense, was published in 2009. The book expands an article that Brooks wrote for New Scientist. Brooks' next book, The Big Questions: Physics, was released in February 2010. It contains twenty 3,000-word essays addressing the most fundamental and frequently asked questions about science. Brooks appeared as a regular guest on George Lamb's BBC Radio 6 Music show. His slot on the show, entitled Weird Science, features weird and wonderful stories from the world of science. Brooks currently co- presents the podcast Science(ish) with UK presenter Rick Edwards which explores the science behind the movies. Science Party The Science Party is a UK political party that was launched on 20 April 2010 by Brooks and Sumit Paul-Choudhury, an editor of New Scientist. A key goal in the Science Party manifesto is ensuring \\"that science, mathematics and engineering have sufficient funding, skills and political priority\\". The Science Party challenged MP David Tredinnick in his constituency of Bosworth in the East Midlands, in the 2010 general election on a pro-scientific manifesto. Tredinnick is a supporter of alternative medicine and critical of science. It was revealed in the 2009 United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal that Tredinnick claimed ¬£700 in his MP expenses for astrology software and training, which he repaid following media publicity. Tredinnick also led 70 MPs in a motion to ignore a House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee report recommending the NHS to cease funding homeopathic treatments.UK election: Round one to the Science Party New Scientist blog, 29 April 2010, retrieved 08/05/2010. In criticising Tredinnick, Brooks also points to the cash-for-questions affair, where Tredinnick accepted a ¬£1,000 payment from an under cover reporter for what was described as a consultancy service but which essentially involved raising a question before parliament, an act that has been described as accepting a bribe for interference in parliamentary proceedings. This scandal led to Tredinnick and one other MP being suspended from Parliament. Brooks also criticises Tredinnick for his MP's expense claim of ¬£125 for attending a course on \\"intimate relationships\\". Tredinnick defended his views on using astrology for medicine by saying \\"Systems of healthcare in India and China have linked medicine and astronomy for centuries. Are we really just dismissing their views?\\". Brooks describes Tredinnick as \\"a champion of pseudo-science and a hindrance to rational governance\\". Brooks received 197 votes in the election, 0.4% of the votes cast.UK election: The Science Party's democracy experiment, Sumit Paul- Choudhury, The S Word blog, New Scientist, 7 May 2010, retrieved 08/05/2010.

Life He was born at Munich, entered the Society of Jesus 3 October 1712, and after his studies in the Society, taught rhetoric and belles lettres for ten years. He then for two years preached on the missions, and he was made director of the Latin sodality at Munich, a post which he filled for eleven years. From 1752 to 1763 he preached at Augsburg Cathedral. His controversial sermons were directed in a great part against the Lutherans, and in particular against the apostate monk :de:Franz Ignatius Rothfischer, and Chladonium. He died at Augsburg. Works His works, as enumerated in Sommervogel, number 112 books and pamphlets. They include: Latin plays for the use of his Latin sodality, which periodically staged such productions for the pleasure and edification of the literary men of Munich; sermons which he had delivered in the pulpit of Augsburg cathedral; works on asceticism; treatises on rhetoric and poetry; and some essays on moral theology in defence of the Jesuit system. Some of his Latin plays were republished in his two collections, \\"Theatrum Asceticum\\" and \\"Theatrum Politicum\\". \\"Theatrum Asceticum, sive Meditationes Sacrae in Theatro Congregationis Latinae de B.

On his ascetical writings probably the most famous and most valuable is the little book \\"Idea Theologiae Asceticae, Scientiam Sanctorum exhibens\\", a posthumous work first published in Rome by Alexander Monaldi in 1839. It has gone through five editions in Latin and has been translated into various languages. The English edition bears the title: \\"The Science of the Spiritual Life\\".

He was born in Kaikohe, and was named after his great-uncle H≈çne Heke. Ngapua is best remembered for his advocacy for Te Kotahitanga, sponsorship of MƒÅori autonomy in Parliament through a Native Rights Bill, and his successful intervention in the Dog Tax War of 1898. Biography Ngapua was born on 6 June 1869 at Kaikohe, the eldest child of Niurangi Puriri and Hone Ngapua. His paternal grandfather was Tuhirangi, the elder brother of H≈çne Heke Pokai. He won the Northern Maori electorate in 1893, with the support of Kotahitanga. He was adjudged bankrupt and vacated the seat on 29 October 1900. However, he was re-elected to the seat in a by-election on 9 January 1901 (as Joseph Ward was in 1897). He died in Wellington of tuberculosis at only 40 while an MP in 1909. In 1894, and again in 1896, Ngapua introduced a Native Rights Bill sponsored by the Kotahitanga movement which sought political autonomy for MƒÅori and a separate MƒÅori Parliament. Ngapua collaborated with Apirana Ngata to eventually incorporate elements of the Native Rights Bill in the MƒÅori Land Administration Act and MƒÅori Councils Act, both of which passed in 1900. Ngapua earned a reputation as a peacemaker through his two major interventions in disputes between MƒÅori and the Crown. The first was in the Uruwera survey trouble of 1895 in which Ngapua counselled peace and prevented armed conflict from breaking out. In 1898, Ngapua hastily returned to his electorate and arrived just in time to defuse a face-off between MƒÅori led by Hone Riiwi Toia and Crown forces at the height of the Dog Tax War of 1898. In the later years of his life Ngapua was influential in the development of the Young Maori Party through his personal relationships and political collaborations with James Carroll, Ngata, and Peter Buck. Upon his death, Peter Buck took up his seat in the House of Representatives with the backing of Ngapua's family and tribe.

The species is common in tropical to subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, ranging from South Africa in the west to Japan in the east, typically inhabiting inshore reefs and bays. The species is easily distinguished by its elongate dorsal and anal fin lobes and filamentous dorsal rays, as well as its scaleless breast. Longfin trevally are pelagic predators, taking a variety of small fish, cephalopods and crustaceans, and reach sexual maturity at around 21 cm. The species has a maximum known length of 57 cm and weight of 3.5 kg. The longfin trevally has a very complex taxonomic history which is closely intertwined with another currently valid species, Carangoides ciliarius, which may yet prove to be synonymous. Longfin trevally are of minor importance to fisheries throughout their range and are considered good table fish, and are occasionally taken by anglers. Taxonomy and naming The longfin trevally is classified within the genus Carangoides, a group of fish commonly called jacks and trevallies. Carangoides falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, the Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. The species was first scientifically described by the German naturalist Eduard R√ºppell in 1830, based on a specimen taken from the Red Sea, which was designated to be the holotype. R√ºppell named the species Citula armata, placing his new species in what was at the time a valid jack genus created by Georges Cuvier in 1816. Citula was later synonymised with Pseudocaranx, and all its members were re- examined and placed in a number of different jack genera. C. armata became Caranx armatus, also masculinising the species name. Finally, the species was placed in Carangoides after re-examinations of its anatomy by a number of authors as part of a larger investigation into the taxonomy of the carangid fishes. The species was subsequently described independently under three different names, with Cuvier applying Caranx ciliaris to the species, Masamitsu ≈åshima applying Citula pescadorensis and Yojiro Wakiya Caranx schlegeli. These are all considered to be invalid junior synonyms under ICZN rules. The complexities of this naming process has led to extensive confusion between this species, originally described as Citula armata, and a very closely related species, Sciaena armata, now probably a synonym of Carangoides ciliarius. Sciaena armata, originally named by Peter Forssk√•l in 1775, has never been definitively identified, but in the same volume he described C. armatus in, R√ºppell created Citula ciliaria. He was unsure if this species was the same fish Forssk√•l described as S. armatus, and subsequent reviews of this species complex tend to keep R√ºppell as the author. Carangoides armatus and Carangoides ciliarius were considered synonymous in a 1975 review of the species, however some authorities still consider them both to be valid species. Description The male longfin trevally has trailing dorsal and anal fin filamentsThe longfin trevally has a similar body profile to most other jacks, having a deep, strongly compressed body. It is a medium-sized fish, growing to a maximum known length of 57 cm, and at least 3.5 kg in weight. The profile of the head is very steep from the mouth to the nape, especially in adults. There is a weak adipose eyelid covering the eye, which is about equal to or smaller than the snout length. Both jaws are lined with villiform teeth, although larger specimens have small conical teeth in bands. The gill rakers are one of the diagnostic features of the species, having 30 to 37 rakers on the first arch. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of 13 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 19 to 22 soft rays. The second dorsal fin is sexually dimorphic, with mature males longer than 21 cm having 3 to 12 of the central soft rays extended into thin filaments of varying lengths. The anal fin has 2 anteriorly detached spines followed by a single spine connected to 16 to 18 soft rays. The lobes of both the anal and dorsal fin are highly extended, giving the species its name. The anal fins also show extension into filaments to a lesser degree. The pectoral fins are falcate to subfalcate with 18-20 rays, while the caudal fin is deeply forked with bilateral, paired caudal keels. The pelvic fins are short, and fit in fairly pronounced ventral grooves, similar to that of Atropus atropos The lateral line is moderately arched anteriorly, with the curved section containing 57 to 77 scales, while the straight section contains 25 to 43 elements, 11 to 24 of which are weak scutes. Another of the diagnostic traits of the longfin trevally is the scaleless breast, extending from the origin of the pelvic fins to the base of the pectoral fin and anteriorly to the gill cover. There are 24 vertebrae in the species. The longfin trevally's colour is variable with age, although maintains a general colouration of greyish blue above, fading to a whitish silver near the belly region. Younger individuals show a more silver blue dorsally, and have six dark crossbars visible on the body past the pectoral fin base. There is a distinct blackish blotch on the upper margin of the operculum. The first dorsal fin is pale grey to black, while the second dorsal fin and anal fin are both hyaline to black. The pectorals are dusty hyaline, the pelvics are usually black with a white leading edge and the caudal fin is also hyaline, with a dusty trailing edge. Distribution and habitat The longfin trevally inhabits tropical to subtropical waters of the Indian and west Pacific Oceans. It is distributed from East London, South Africa in the west, north to Madagascar, eastern Africa, India, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and to Japan in the east. The species is also common in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Oman. The species inhabits inshore coastal waters rarely venturing offshore, and is pelagic, inhabiting both the upper and lower sections of the water column. Longfin trevally are commonly found on rocky and coral coastlines, often inhabiting reef complexes, with solitary individuals or groups of larger fish patrolling the edges of reefs. They are also found in shallow, sandy bays and lagoons, with juveniles known to enter and use estuaries as nursery areas. Biology and fishery The longfin trevally is a predatory fish, known to take a variety of small fishes, cephalopods including squid, and crustaceans such as crabs and mantis shrimp. The species' long gill rakers also help to filter minute organisms from the seawater, adding to the fish's diet. Longfin trevallies reach sexual maturity at 21 to 22 cm in length. There has been no research into their spawning patterns, although it is known juveniles inhabit shallow bays and occasionally estuaries. Longfin trevally are generally too rare to be a viable target for commercial fisheries, although they are occasionally landed and sold fresh locally. The species is considered good table fare, although it is highly esteemed in Thailand and Cambodia, where the filets are steamed or fried. Small quantities are taken by recreational fishermen in South Africa, often from boats using fish baits on hook and line gear or lures, as well as by spear.

History =Early years The team was established in 1940 under the name Algodoneros de Uni√≥n Laguna, named for the Compa√±√≠a Jabonera la Uni√≥n (Union Soap Company), the team's first sponsor. The team won its first pennant in 1942 under manager Mart√≠n Dihigo. The franchise moved to Nuevo Laredo in 1944, but an expansion club restored baseball to the region between 1946 and 1953. In the 1950 season, Laguna won their second and latest title to date, with Guillermo Garibay as manager. 1970‚Äì1981 With the creation of the Zona Norte in 1970, the Comarca Lagunera returned to the Mexican League. The new Algodoneros de Uni√≥n Laguna played their home games in G√≥mez Palacio, Durango from 1970 to 1974, and moved across the border to Torre√≥n for the 1975 season with the construction of Estadio Superior, which reused the structure of the former Colt Stadium in Houston. The move coincided with new ownership, Don Juan Abusaid R√≠os. The team won the Zona Norte in 1974, 1976, and 1978, but fell to the Diablos Rojos del M√©xico (1974, 1976) and Rieleros de Aguascalientes (1978) in the league championship. After the 1981 season and a falling out between ownership and Governor Jos√© de las Fuentes, Abusaid sold the team to the Sindicato de Trabajadores Petroleros de la Rep√∫blica Mexicana (Union of Oil Workers of the Mexican Republic), which moved the franchise to Tampico, Tamaulipas. While the stadium was taken down in Torre√≥n and moved to Tampico, the franchise spent the 1982 season in Monclova, Coahuila, as the Astros de Monclova. 1985‚Äì2003 In 1985, the Indios de Ciudad Ju√°rez were bought by Jorge Due√±es Zurita and moved to Torre√≥n, where the franchise has remained since. The team made the postseason in 1989, 1990, 1992, and 1994, but in their lone league championship appearance in 1990, they fell in five games to the Bravos de Le√≥n. Uni√≥n Laguna was bought in 1997 by FEMSA- Cervecer√≠a Cuauht√©moc-Moctezuma, which sold the team in 2002 to Ricardo Mart√≠n Bringas, the director general of Organizaci√≥n Soriana. Vaqueros Laguna Vaqueros Laguna logo used between the 2003 and 2016 seasons At the beginning of the 21st century, the new management opted to change the team's name and colors. The Vaqueros Laguna (Laguna Cowboys) donned orange uniforms beginning with the 2003 season. The team appeared in the playoffs in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2015, the latter two years as the wild card. Vaqueros Uni√≥n Laguna The 2017 season marked a return to tradition for baseball in Torre√≥n as the franchise restored the Uni√≥n Laguna name and switched back to maroon as its primary color. Return to Algodoneros The 2018 season further marked a return to tradition for baseball in Torre√≥n, as the franchise restored the original name under which the club had been founded in 1940: the Algodoneros de Uni√≥n Laguna.

They have won three championships (1980, 2009, and 2010). Their home ballpark is the Estadio de B√©isbol Francisco I. Madero in Saltillo, Coahuila. The 1979 Saraperos were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. History The Saraperos joined the Mexican League in 1970. The team was developed during a dinner held by the members of the Committee for Construction of the Cathedral of Saltillo, led by its president, Don Jorge Torres Casso. Initial discussions concerned the cost of the franchise, including purchase of players. With the support of the Governor and the Mayor of Saltillo, the Saraperos organized with Don Jorge Torres Casso as president, Mr. Flavio Trevino, Javier L√≥pez del Bosque and Gustavo Lara Ramos as vice- presidents, Eleazar Galindo as treasurer and Flores Valdez Eustolio as secretary. The Saraperos had successful seasons during the 1970s, reaching the league play-offs and finishing as runners-up in 1971, 1972, and 1973. The 1980 season was suspended due to a player's strike, known as \\"The Curse of the Anabe\\". The Mexican League decided to conduct a special season mini- championship, won by the Saraperos. The Saraperas were runners-up again in 1988, losing to the Mexican Red Devils in 5 games. In late 1998, Sinaloan Juan Manuel Ley purchased the franchise from Javier Siller Saltillo. This marked the beginning of a new era for the team. After this purchase the home stadium, Estadio Francisco I. Madero, underwent major renovations to expand capacity, all games were broadcast on a local television network in Saltillo, and promotions began to entice families to attend games. The 1999 season was a resounding success with Saltillo Plaza as the most attended game of the season and after three years without a postseason (1996-8) they qualified for the playoffs with third place in the General Table quarterfinals, but were eliminated after 6 games against the Campeche Pirates. During the semifinals, the Saraperos faced the Mexico Red Devils in 7 intense games; the Red Devils went on to win the championship of the 1999 season. The Saraperos were the most successful club in the 1999-2005 phase of the Mexican League, leading in club attendance at the league level and qualifying for the playoffs in all 7 seasons of that period, playing exciting postseason series. Notably, the Sarapera roster included the renowned pitcher Luis Ayala (currently of the Washington Nationals) during this era. It was said that there was a curse on the Saraperos of Saltillo during this time: \\"Saraperos will not be champions until Francisco Paquin Estrada Saltillo is the manager.\\" Estrada Saltillo was the manager of the Pirates of Campeche, to whom the Saraperos lost in the 2004 championship final. Although they lost the final of 2004, the Saraperos were the two-time champions of the Northern Zone (Finals runner up), with titles won in 2004 and 2005. Their high level of play continued with additional play- offs qualifications in 2006-2013. Despite the team \\"curse\\", the Saraperos won the league championship in the 2009 season, lead by manager Orlando Sanchez. These finals were won after 6 games against the Quintana Roo Tigers. In 2010, they returned to the championship to defend their title, winning in 5 games against rivals Puebla Pericas. Stadium The Estadio de B√©isbol Francisco I. Madero, is a baseball stadium that is part of the Ciudad Deportiva Francisco I. Madero in Saltillo, Coahuila. It was built in 1964 and is located on the corner of Boulevard Jesus Valdez Sanchez Nazario Ortiz Garza Blvd, east of the city. Over the years, the stadium has undergone several changes including the expansion of its seating capacity from 7,500 to its current 16,000 in late 1998. Prior to the 2011 season, about $87 billion, funded by the State Government of Coahuila and the team, were invested to renovate the stadium. The Mexican League All-Star Game was held at the stadium in 1986, 2002, and 2011. The 2002 event was an international match between the teams of Mexico and Cuba.

On a BBC interview, he staunchly defended the decision of his colleagues to leave the country, claiming that the government's plan to bring charges against the newspaper's top editors made their tasks impossible to carry out.\\"Interview with Network Africa\\" Presently, he is a vocal democracy activist and a student in Oxford, England. Career A lawyer and political theorist by training, Abiye started his media career writing on legal issues of the Eritrean-Ethiopian War (1998‚Äì2000) on Ethiopian Reporter, a private weekly newspaper. He later wrote a mea culpa questioning his early ‚Äúunskeptical‚Äù support of the war, in which he lamented that the war's popular support arose from jingoistic conceptions of patriotism. He criticized the forced expulsion of Eritreans from Ethiopia as a travesty of human values. His view was attacked for being insufficiently sensitive of political reality. He suggested that the two countries should adopt the European Union's economic and political model to avoid subsequent wars. Abiye found fame in sports analysis. Blunt and intentionally contrarian, he complimented the famous Fiseha Tegegn‚Äôs authoritative style on \\"Talk Football\\", a Sunday football talk show co-presented by the duo.\\"Talkshow closed\\" The talk show was discontinued by the Ethiopian government, following the bloody protests of June 2005. The government accused both presenters of supporting an unlawful insurrection. He is an editor in reporter newspaper  Politics  Abiye describes himself as a Post-Rawlsian liberal, although he has never defined what it means. In one of his blogs, he suggested that the principle of Justice as Fairness that is associated with the American philosopher John Rawls can be modified by adopting some salient points raised by Rawls' \\"identity and difference\\" critics to form a coherent system of thought that can solve Ethiopia's fundamental political problems. He argued that Liberalism had answers to the issues of language, identity and poverty. In his early writing, he supported the current federal arrangement in Ethiopia but said the power of interpreting the constitution should not be vested upon the upper chamber of parliament. He claimed that a strong inter-state commerce provision in the constitution coupled with a hybrid presidential/parliamentary system and a judiciary that has a power to interpret the constitution could strengthen the union without endangering the federal arrangement. In recent years, he has been silent on this issue. He mainly blogs about politics now, and often criticizes Ethiopian government of perpetrating human rights abuses and closing spaces of democratic participation. He says two political issues - government co-optation and fake growth numbers - are his obsessions now. Controversy After the Ethiopian general election in 2005, Abiye turned into a vociferous critic of the government, sometimes writing articles riddled with statistical analysis, which he said could prove that the EPRDF might have lost the election. But he stopped short of calling for the overthrow of the government. The paper he edited was shut down in December 2005. He had been arrested by the police. In 2010, the government charged Abiye and five other journalists under the country's anti-terrorism law. \\"Ethiopia charges six journalists\\" An Ethiopian judge sentenced Abiye to eight years in prison, citing his role in providing outlawed opposition groups a platform to disseminate anti-government propaganda on his website.\\"Ethiopia sentences six journalists\\" Abiye called the prosecution a politically motivated attack on dissent.\\"The journalist as terrorist: an Ethiopian story\\" In September 2009, Addis Neger newspaper wrote an editorial believed to be authored by Abiye and his colleague Mesfin Negash that questioned the journalistic value of balance. The editorial said Addis Neger believed that the fundamental journalistic ideal was truth and journalists could not reach the truth by splitting the difference or giving equal lines to competing claims. Addis Neger professed to follow rigorous social science methods in investigating issues. \\"What differentiates our approach from academic works is not methodology,\\" the paper declared. \\"It is writing style and presentation. We believe journalists are social scientists. No social scientist worthy of his profession reaches conclusions by balancing competing claims.\\" In response to this editorial, the state media said Addis Neger had exposed that it was not independent. Styles of writing Abiye and his colleagues at Addis Neger were known for a distinctive writing technique which mixed long narratives with analysis. Supporters of the Ethiopian government accused them of using this style to repeatedly cast doubts on the government's core policy successes. Abiye wrote articles which questioned the government's growth figures, inflation curbing policies, mega-dam projects, human rights records and foreign policy.\\"Addis Neger's Higera\\" He was, however, very critical of most of the opposition parties even though in the last days of Addis Neger he wrote articles which praised Medrek, a coalition of eight opposition parties. In interviews, he expressed his support for Medrek's goal of mid-way solution for Ethiopia and praised the coalition's democratic aspirations. He was also criticized for his support to jailed opposition leader Birtukan Mideksa. In 2007, Abiye reported the US elections from Washington DC.\\"Africans share their impressions\\" He was accused of lack of objectivity as some of his articles had visible pro-Obama slant. Abiye was also generally criticized for strong Neo-liberal views in most of his writings and his apparent links with Western policy makers. In a country where newspapers repeatedly went out of business owing to government pressure, Addis Neger's closure prompted unusually strong reactions from Western countries.

Just Another Asshole #1 and #2: The Zines Barbara Ess edited the first two installments of Just Another Asshole alone; these photocopied zines utilized intermingling high contrast compositions of apocalyptic warnings, celebrity close-ups, helicopters, and tabloids. The title for these works came from the first zine, which contains an alarming juxtaposition of the image of a deaf boy killed by an attack that he could not hear alongside the handwritten words just another asshole, a coupling which drops both cynical subjectivity and objectivity in the viewer's lap. The materiality of the zines, taped together with electrical tape and overlaid with red writing, heightened the boldness of the aesthetic. Just Another Asshole #3: Tabloid Format Magazine This issue was co-edited by Jane M. Sherry and was born out of an open call for work, where anything would be accepted for publication.

History In 1980, the Alacranes de Durango moved to Campeche, and played their home games at Venustiano Carranza Park. Their first season was incomplete as the result of a strike carried out by the league's players. It would not take long for the franchise to find success. In 1981, they finished with a 71‚Äì50 record, good for second place in the Zona Sur, and beat the Tigres Capitalinos, 4‚Äì1, in the first round before falling to the Diablos Rojos del M√©xico in seven games. In 1983, under player-manager Francisco Estrada, the team achieved its first league title. It won the intra- zone round-robin postseason tournament with a 13‚Äì5 record and beat the Indios de Ciudad Ju√°rez in seven games. The team made the playoffs again in 1986. In 1989 and 1990, they reached the zone finals, but lost. Several times in the 1990s, the Piratas made the playoffs and lost in the first round. Between 1998 and 2000, the Piratas played at Leandro Dom√≠nguez Park while their normal venue was renovated; the team returned to the renamed and rebuilt Estadio Nelson Barrera in 2001. Francisco Estrada returned to manage the Piratas to their second title in 2004, finishing second in their zone with a 54‚Äì41 record and beating the Olmecas de Tabasco in five games, the Tigres in five, and the Diablos Rojos in seven; they won the LMB championship by defeating the Saraperos de Saltillo in five games. Estrada's number was the first ever retired by the franchise.

He taught at the Utah State University and is founder of the Institute of Frescography. Latzke is Honorary Professor of the Fudan University, Shanghai and Guest Professor of the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art . Latzke was ranked one of the 12 cultural trendsetters of the 1990s by Forbes and one of the world's best artists of the last four centuries by the Artists Trade Union of Russia. He is a cousin of Poland¬¥s wealthiest entrepreneur Jan Kulczyk.

Icarus, ceiling painting by Rainer Maria Latzke, Chateau Thal, Belgium, 1986 Eckart Witzigmann at the \\"Aubergine\\" in front of Latzke¬¥s murals Rainer Maria Latzke was born in Germany in 1950. He was raised near Cologne along with his 8 siblings by his father Alfons, an art teacher, and his mother Lisa, who was also an artist. His father¬¥s family comes from Poland, while his mother was a Kohlsch√ºtter, a family of famous scientists such as Arnold and Ernst Kohlsch√ºtter. Latzke studied art, philosophy, and educational science at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz Germany, and then continued his art studies at the D√ºsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts under the supervision of Joseph Beuys and Gerhard Richter from 1972 to 1976. In 1974 he earned a master's degree in pedagogy and philosophy and in 1976 he earned a master's degree in art. After teaching art for two years, he quit and traveled to Italy in 1980 where he studied Renaissance painting techniques and fresco painting in Florence and Rome. In 1981 he married Doris Boecke, with whom he had three children, Rene Marcus (born 1981), who is married to English artist Paula Hammond, Katharina Maria (born 1983) and Maurice Amadeus (born 1985). In 2008 his first grandchild, Tristan Francis, was born to Katharina, who is married to US citizen Paul Smith. In 1982 his career as a muralist started to advance: His collaboration with Harrods in London opened doors to prominent clients, like royal families in the Middle East. He worked for Mercedes Benz, for whom he designed the artwork for their 100-year celebration exhibition \\"Welt Mobil\\", and prominent rock bands like The Scorpions, for whom he created the computer-controlled electronic mural \\"Night over Manhattan\\". In 1992 he was featured by the European issue of Forbes magazine in the article \\"Stars of tomorrow - cultural trendsetters with major input of the decade\\". In 1984 Latzke acquired the 1760 built \\"Chateau Thal\\" in Belgium and restored the 38-room castle as well decorated it with numerous murals. He taught mural painting to apprentices in the castle's studio, who later opened their own wall painting studios which led to a new Renaissance of wall painting in contemporary Interior Design. After his move to Monte Carlo in 1995, he acquired the \\"Villa Paradou\\" the former residence of late Henri Chr√©tien, the Oscar-winning inventor of the Cinemascope technique, in 1998. The villa, built by French architect Charles Garnier was due to after being abandoned for a longer time in very poor condition. Latzke refurbished the estate consisting of two buildings situated in an overgrown park and restored the existing wall paintings. In 1998 he published the book \\"Traumwelten - Die Kunst der Dritten Dimension\\" and in 1990 \\"Dreamworlds, the making of a room with illusionary painting\\". In the Villa Paradou he also continued his work in developing new techniques for the production and reproduction of murals, which he had started in Belgium in 1988 with the \\"Artscape\\" technique. In 2000 he was awarded a patent for his invention of the Frescography. He also engaged himself in music, composing songs and lyrics, and worked together with South France studio musicians and Phil Palmer, who also worked with Roger Daltrey, and the Dire Straits. In 2009 Latzke founded the Institute of Frescography, a research and educational nonprofit organization for mural art.  Frescography  In the late 1980s Rainer Maria Latzke began to develop new techniques for the production of murals, which led to the invention of the Frescography and the CAM Software. This patented technique consists of a computer programme, the Dreamworlds Design Studio, which allows the user to assemble individual mural designs using a large selection of cut-out images. Prior to starting a design the dimensions of the wall are entered into the software to create a workspace reflecting the project wall. The designs are then transferred in the artist's studio onto a single canvas in wall size and then attached on site using a similar procedure as with wallpaper. Frescographies take only a few hours to design on the computer, and are produced and delivered within a short period of time (2‚Äì 4 weeks).

They played their home games at the Estadio Universitario Beto √Åvila in Veracruz, Veracruz. History Baseball was introduced to Veracruz during the early 20th century by employees of American and British oil companies. Native employees began to take an interest in the games, played by the managers of these companies, who then purchased uniforms for the new players. The uniforms they purchased were red, which had a lasting effect on future baseball teams in Veracruz. Mexican Eagle Petroleum Co., a Mexican oil company now known as Pemex, was the inspiration for the name of the first baseball club founded in Veracruz, the Rojos del √Åguila (\\"Reds of the Eagle\\"), founded on September 16, 1903. Beginnings One of the original teams of the Mexican Baseball League, √Åguila won its first championship titles in 1937 and 1938, when the league was recently organized and began to keep statistics. Agust√≠n Verde was the team's manager at the time. Subsequent titles came in 1952 and 1961, both under The Kangaroo Santos Amaro's management, and Enrique Izquierdo led the team to its fifth win in 1970. Their sixth win in 2012 was under manager Pedro Mer√©, \\"El Comemangos\\" They are one of the most recognized teams in the Mexican League. √Åguila played in the Veracruz Sports Park until 1986, when the team retired from the league. When the team returned in 1992, it adopted Estadio Universitario Beto √Åvila as the new headquarters. Titles=1937 The Eagle won their first championship title in 1937, under Cuban Agust√≠n Verde, in an official championship and inaugural Mexican Baseball League game. Martin Dihigo's outstanding performance, both on the pitching mound and in the batter's box, was a major contributing factor to their win. The team included field players Augustine \\"Pijini\\" Bejarano, Felino Cardenas Estaquillo Martinez, Martin \\"El Maestro\\" Dihigo, Francisco Medina, Alberto Cornejo, Nero Arjona, Donato \\"Toco\\" Aldama, Ramon Michelena, Antonio Tenorio, Julian Ramirez Paj√≥n and Agustin Verde; and pitchers Gustavo Ortiz, Martin Dihigo, Sabas Mora and Carlos Rubio. Sabas Mora holds the win-loss record at 7-0 with an ERA of 2.09, and Martin Dihigo is credited with winning the three games in a row needed to win the series. 1938 In 1938, Dihigo led the team to a second title, again directed by Agust√≠n Verde+. Dihigo reached a batting average of .387, and swept the pitching department with 18 wins and 2 losses and an ERA of 0.90, with 184 strikeouts. The team consisted of field players Martin \\"El Maestro\\" Dihigo, Silvio Garcia, Jacinto Roque, Manuel Salvatierra, Nero Arjona, Jos√© Luis G√≥mez Rodr√≠guez, Donato \\"Toco\\" Aldama, Raul \\"Chical√≥n\\" Mendez, Jorge Rosas, Alberto Cornejo, Amado Alvarez and Julian \\"Handjob\\" Ramirez; and pitchers Martin Dihigo, Julian Ramirez, Silvio Garcia, Tirso de Anda and Raul Mendez. 1952: The crown of 1952 The third team title in the Mexican Baseball League was won with another Cuban, Santos \\"The Kangaroo\\" Amaro. In this campaign, Santos Amaro led the team to another title with the help of Rene Gonzalez, who achieved the highest batting average of .370, and Peter \\"Charrascas\\" Ramirez, Mario Ariosa, Antonio Castanon, Charles White, Earl \\"Red Skin\\" Taborn, Guillermo \\"Huevito\\" (Little Egg) Alvarez, Reynaldo Green, Gonzalo \\"The Blackout\\" Morales, Ricardo \\"Chamaco\\" (The kid) Garza, Rafael \\"Chino\\" Lopez, Jaime \\"El Loco\\" (Crazy) Abad, Manuel Fuentes, Octavio Favela, Ernesto Cortes, Federico Cortes, Isidro Ortiz and Santos Amaro himself as field players. In the pitching department, the top player in that season was William \\"Don Pants\\" Lopez, who won 19 games for 8 lost, and a 2.94 ERA. Pitching importance followed with Lino Donoso (18 - 11), Guadalupe Orteg√≥n, Fernando Sanchez, Pedro Ramirez and Hector Moreno Mar√≠n \\"Pepino\\" Azamar. 1961: The power of Al Pinkston Nine years elapsed before the Eagle Reds returned to winning a pennant Mexican Baseball League game in 1961, again under the leadership of Santos Amaro. This season, the magic came with \\"tremendous thumper\\" Alfred Pinkston joining the team from the Mexico City Red Devils, who, with solid work in the batting order, led the Eagle to conquer a new championship. Pinkston, according to his numbers and to those who were fortunate enough to see him play, was a tremendous player. He hit .374 that year, and highlighted the work of the \\"explosive\\" Cuban Witremundo \\"Witti\\" Quintana, who, that year, was the champion of runs of in league with 23 homers. Equally important in this season were the following batters that were above a .300 percentage: Asdrubal Baro, Miguel \\"Pilo\\" Gaspar and William Berzunza, followed by below average \\"Magic\\" Felipe Montemayor, Ernesto \\"Natas\\" Garcia, Paul Bernard, Mario Ariosa, Ramiro Caballero, Witremundo Quintana, Ronaldo \\"Ronnie\\" Camacho, Mario Luna, Juan de Dios Hern√°ndez Esquivel and Felipe Villareal. On the pitch, a \\"legend\\" was born, a pillar to achieving the team win that season was Ramon \\"Three Skates\\" Arano, who managed to earn a record of 11 wins and 3 losses, and a 3.72 ERA. Following in his footsteps were Jesus Williams (11-8), Lino \\"Chucumite\\" Donoso (10-6), Silvio Castellanos (14-14), Rodolfo Alvaro (11-6), Guillermo Lopez, Aubrey Grigsbi, Pablo Montes de Oca, Lazaro Uscanga, Guillermo Vazquez, Pedro Juli√°n Ladera, and Montane. 1970: The fifth championship As if it were predestined, it was another 9 years until the team won another championship. The Eagle Reds were directed once again by a Cuban, this time Enrique Izquierdo. They had important figures for sure, but overall it was an even year as individual accomplishments go. To highlight the work of Cuban Rogelio \\"El Borrego\\" (The lamb) Alvarez, he had 33 runs, was the league champion in that department, and batted a .288 percentage. There were three players who hit over .300 percentage: Emilio Sosa (.328), Roberto \\"The Engineer\\" Ortiz (.305) and Rolando Camarero (.304). Other hitters were Nicol√°s Vazquez, Rogelio Alvarez, Francisco Rodriguez Ituarte, Wilfredo Arano, Francisco Chavez, Enrique Izquierdo, Jose Manuel Hernandez, Porfirio Ruiz, Tobias Santos, Rufino Reyes, Jose Reyes Cruz, Joaquin Santiago, Natanael Alvarado, Ernesto Garc√≠a, Olindo Rojas, Octavio Salgado, Octavio Orozco, Hector Rodriguez, Esteban Valtierra, and Carlos Burgos, and the pitchers were Jesus Rizales (12-6), Cesar Diaz (10-8), Alberto Osorio (10-7), Luis Malpica (9-9), Blas Mazon (13-13) and Ramiro Nu√±o, Rene \\"Saba√±√≥n\\" (Chilblain) Chavez, Francisco Lopez, Octavio Salgado, Hector Brito, Raul Balcazar, Juan de Jesus Quintana, Juan Burgos, and Felipe Antonety. The competition was high that season, with 10 teams divided into two zones, the South and the North, where the championship series was between the zone leaders or the champions in each zone. The Reds won in the final series to the Red Devils, 4 games to 2, in the Veracruz Sports Park, crowned to the noise of the home crowd. 2012: The sixth star After 42 years of no real accomplishments, the team had a great season in 2011when they reached the Mexican League Championship Series in the South Zone. The Eagle Reds managed to win the Mexican Baseball League Championship for the sixth time in its history. With the 2011 team foundation, with the addition of great players in the final stretch of the season like Lorenzo Barcelo, the team ended with six wins and no losses in the postseason. By adding Venezuelan Frank Diaz, Puerto Rican Carlos Rivera and Jos√© Cobos, the Reds were able to form a very solid team. In addition to the four reinforcements mentioned, the hitters were George \\"The Black\\" Guzman, Venezuelan Jos√© Castillo, \\"Jarocho\\" Humberto Sosa, Jose Guadalupe Chavez, Jose Castaneda, the Veracruz Enrique \\"The Viper\\" Osorio, Jose Orozco, Carlos Ibarra, Leo Rodriguez, Francisco Rivera Veracruz, naturalized Mexican Venezuelan Pedro Castilian, Cura√ßao Sharnol Adriana, and rookies Yoshio Angel Torres and Cesar; pitchers Thomas Solis, who was the leader of victories of the season, Dominican Jailen Peguero, who was the leader of the campaign saves, Victor Alvarez, Manuel Flores, Veracruz Rodolfo Aguirre, Hector \\"El Choco\\" Navarro, Leo Moreno, Veracruz Carlos Santamaria, Luis de la O, and rookies Remberto Romo, Jesus Barraza, and Jose Dominguez, had their names embroidered in gold letters for being on the roster of players who achieved sixth star for the Eagle Reds. The manager Pedro Mer√© deserves special mention, who took over the team a little after half-way through the season. The \\"Prince of Mango\\" continued the work begun by Puerto Rican Orlando Merced, who was suspended by the league for the rest of the season. Mere, who had won three championships with the Los Tuxtlas Brujos (sorceres) in the Veracruz Winter League, was crowned as manager in his debut in the Mexican Baseball League, as well as becoming the first Mexican leader of the ', as the team's five previous championships were won under Cuban managers. The Eagle won their sixth championship, on August 29, 2012, taking the seventh game in the series to Rieleros de Aguascalientes, 8-1, in the packed \\"Beto √Åvila\\" University Sports Park. The Eagle Reds received the Zaachila Cup. With the culmination of a winning season, Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa later toured the main boulevard of Veracruz thanking the fans for their support. Duarte gave a reception to the new kings of the Mexican Baseball League in the Hall of Flags. Afterwards, there was a meal with the governor, the players, and with the directors of the team. At 6pm, there was a Thanksgiving Mass at the University Sports Park \\"Beto √Åvila\\", and the edge of 8pm, a convoy of Mexican Baseball League champions paraded through the main streets of Veracruz, where thousands of fans gathered to cheer on their idols. The caravan with new Zaachila Cup holders ran from the Plaza of the Securities to the Malecon Macroplaza. Happy day. Due to pitcher Tomas Solis' great performance, he was appointed as the Pitcher of the Year, and Dominican Jailen Peguero was recognized as the Reliever of the Year. Finally, in the framework of the XLII Mexican Baseball National Convention held in Villahermossa, Tabasco, Jose Antonio Mansur Gal√°n, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Eagle Reds won Executive of the Year award. 1980s After the mid-1970s, Pablo Machado, who was then the owner of the team, decided to take the Eagle to become the Aguascalientes Railroaders. In the early 1980s, the team returned to Veracruz. During that time, the team had among its ranks managers Pazos Fernando Sosa, Armando Rodriguez, \\"Beto\\" Avila, Mario Ariosa, and Carlos Sosa Lagunes. They went unnoticed until the season of 1986, when Evelio Brito (the owner) quit during the same mid-season to disappear at the end of that campaign. Emphasized during that period include George Brunet, Blas Santana, Fernando Elizondo, Vicente Palacios, Hector Madrigal, and others. 1990s After an absence of six years, the Eagle Reds returned to Veracruz in 1992 under the auspices of the organization of Vicente Perez Avell√°, and with the support of Dante Delgado Rannauro, governor at the time, Perez Avell√°, kept the team competitive during the seasons of 1993 and 1994. In 1993, the Reds qualified for the postseason, but lost to the Red Devils by 4 games to none in the first round of playoffs. In 1994, the team qualified to play-off second in the South Zone and won the first postseason series to the Campeche Pirates, 4 games to 3, in a packed University Sports Park \\"Beto √Åvila\\", which has been the home of the Eagle since 1992, but fell to the Red Devils in the divisional final, 4 games to none. During the season of 1995, and without the support of the state governor Patricio Chirinos Calero, the team was dismantled mid-season to finally migrate to Veracruz to become the Poza Rica Oilers for 1996. During the period of 1992 to 1995, famous players included Dominican Manny Hernandez, Miguel Mu√±oz, Juan Luevano, Leo Meza, Heriberto Garcia, American Matt Stark and Carlos \\"El Gato\\" Gastelum, with the debut of Rodrigo Lopez in the Mexican Baseball League. By the end of 1998, and the beginning of his term, governor Miguel Aleman Velasco announced the return of the Eagle after their 4-year absence for the season 1999 of the Mexican Baseball League. The state government acquired the franchise of the Maya Chetumal. By orders of the governor, Antonio Chedraui Mafud was appointed as president of the organization and Gustavo Souza Escamilla as the General Manager. 2000s During the management of Antonio Chedraui and Gustavo Souza, the team qualified for the postseason on only two occasions, the campaigns of 2000 and 2002. In 2000, the Eagle made a big turnaround by getting 2 games to none on the mighty Red Devils, but the Diablos won the next four games, knocking ' out in the first round of playoffs. In 2002, the Reds again qualified for the playoffs, but were swept by the Oaxaca Warriors in the first round. From 1999 to 2004, some highlighted players include Eleazar Mora, Luis Fernando \\"Freckles\\" Morales, Alfredo \\"Tyson\\" Meza, American Mark Whiten, and Venezuelan Lino Connel among others. By the end of 2004, at the beginning of his term of Governor Fidel Herrera Beltran, and after a series of rumors about the possible departure of the team once more, the state government conducted a public opinion survey to determine the future team. At the end of the survey, it was determined that the team would still be owned by 51% to ensure they stay in Veracruz, and sold the remaining 49% stake in Grupo Empresarial Denim sports consultant, whose Mansur was Jose Antonio Beltran, but this partnership with Denim Group lasted only one season, in 2005, later to leave the team management in the hands of Jos√© Antonio Beltr√°n Mansur, owner of 49% shares of the club today. During this administration, the team has only qualified for the playoffs once, in his first year of administration in 2005. In 2005, the \\"Eaglets\\" rated sixth place in the South Zone (In that season 6 teams qualified per zone). After winning against the Pericos de Puebla to get the last ticket to the postseason, they were left out by the domain tiebreaker between the teams despite there being the same win-loss percentage between the two teams. However, the dream ended quickly for the locals by losing to the Angel√≥polis Tigers 4-0 in the first round of the playoffs, adding to that 12-game losing streak in elimination playoffs. During the current administration, the players who excelled and have identified with the fans were Dominican Willis Ot√°√±ez, Emigdio Lopez, and Santiago \\"El Tato\\" Gonzalez. For the season of 2008, the team reached the former \\"bigleaguer\\" Jos√© Offerman. 2010s Currently, the Eagle Reds have been light and dark with respect to their sports. They had one of their worst seasons in 2010 and obtained a record of 39 won to 66 lost, and a percentage of .371. They were also the second to last of the league, just above the Nuevo Laredo Tecolotes, who had a .308 percentage. Despite the poor season, Dominican Victor Diaz and Jorge Guzman, leader and second leader of runs in the Mexican Baseball League, qualified with 29 and 22 respectively. In addition, Diaz was also the leader of careers produced with 96. During the 2011 season, Francisco Mendez and Manuel Bobadilla made the Mexican Baseball League Reds' draft, both from the Dorados de Chihuahua. Subsequently, so did the services of experienced pitcher Juan Acevedo. These reinforcements, combined with some good players already in the club, made the team receive third place in the South Zone with a new record of 54 won by 49 lost, and a percentage of .524. Furthermore, the Eagle led the in league pitching with a 4.24 team ERA. All of this happened under the direction of Manager Daniel Fernandez, who was hired for this campaign. In the single line for the second consecutive season for the team, Jarocho had among its ranks the leader who runs the Mexican Baseball League, this time the Ensenada Jorge Guzman, who hit 39 homers. It is worth mentioning that in addition to the home run lead, the \\"Black\\" won a record of more home runs than Guzm√°n hit by an Eagle player, surpassing the 33 who Cuban Rogelio \\"Borrego\\" Alvarez had previously managed in 1970, and American Mark Whiten in the 2001 season. In addition to Jorge Guzman, who also managed 97 RBIs, some of the players who stood out in this campaign were Victor Diaz, who hit 34 homers and got 89 RBIs, and pitcher Joel Vargas, who scored 11 wins and an ERA of 3.60. In the first round of the playoffs, the ' faced the Campeche Pirates, who they defeated in a tight series of 4 games to 3, achieving qualification for the Southern Zone Championship Series as a visitor in the Estadio Nelson Barrera Romell√≥n of Campeche. The Reds had not won a playoff series since the campaign of 1994, in which they coincidentally defeated the Pirates in 7 games themselves. However, on that occasion were they classified as local in the University Sports Park \\"Beto √Åvila\\" of Veracruz. In the Southern Zone Championship Series, the Eagle lost to the Quintana Roo Tigers by 4 games to 2, thus ending a great season for the team. At the conclusion of the 2012 regular season, the team finished in second place in the South Zone with a record of 67 wins, 44 lost and 1 tie for a percentage of .604. They were also the best pitching group of the league, with a 3.69 ERA, winning this department for the second consecutive season. Collective pitching also had 12 shutouts, while also winning the league lead in this area. Another of the categories they won was the pitching, with 990.2 innings pitched, and the saves with 36, the latter shared with the Tabasco Olmecs. The last time the squad porte√±a had played up to .600 was in 1952, 60 years ago when they were champions for the third time in the circuit. In the single line, the Mochitense pitcher Thomas Solis scored the lead with 2 shutouts, and won with a new 14-4 win-loss record, a title he shared (games won) with the pitcher Monterrey Humberto Montemayor of the Aguascalientes Railroaders, which ended with a 14-6 record. Besides, the leader of the league was Dominican Jailen Peguero, who won 35 rescues. Four of their starting pitchers (all season) gave the team the opportunity to earn 41 wins out of 67 achieved in the tournament, and that apart from the 14 wins of Thomas Solis, Manuel Flores, who also emphasized won 11 games and lost 5, Victor Alvarez who won nine games and lost 2, and Rodolfo Aguirre won 7 games and lost 6, a revealing fact of good and consistent was the s pitching during the regular season. Jarocha began the ninth season under Puerto Rican Manager Orlando Merced, who unfortunately was suspended by the league for the rest of the campaign by an act of indiscipline before the game between the Eagle Reds and the Red Devils, held on Sunday June 10 at the Foro Sol of Mexico City. Because of this situation, the former team's batting coach, Peter Mere Cardenas, had to take the helm. Postseason 2012 In the first round of the playoffs, the Eagle defeated the Tabasco Olmecs by 4 games to 1, thus passing through to the ' Championship Series for the second consecutive season. In the South Division Championship Series the ' defeated the Quintana Roo Tigers by 4 games to 2, reaching the Final Series of the Mexican Baseball League (\\"King Series\\") after 42 years of dormancy. It highlights the great performance of the pitcher Dominican Lorenzo Barcelo, who chiseled monticulares jewelry couple in the American League Championship Series South Zone, to help the Eagle Reds to get their passport to Serie del Rey Mexican Baseball League. In the Serie del Rey, the Eagle Reds faced the Aguascalientes Railroaders, who they defeated in a tight final series of 4 games to 3, achieving Jarocho a team win since their sixth championship in the Mexican Baseball League. The MVP trophy went to Dominican pitcher Lorenzo Barcelo, who won two key victories in Serie del Rey. The nomination for Barcel√≥, who finished the playoffs with a 6-0 record, was a distinction just over Veracruz Humberto Sosa, who wore five gunboat produced in Game 4 and key battles in Game 6. Leaving Veracruz The Eagle Reds played their final season in Veracruz in 2017.

The river's headwaters are in extreme southeastern Cochise County, Arizona as Black Draw. From here the Rio San Bernardino flows south, crossing into Mexico east of Douglas, Arizona.

Ecology North American beaver (Castor canadensis) were documented by Leopold in 1977 in northern Mexico, and a 2000 survey found five breeding pairs of beavers on the Caj√≥n Bonito River mostly in remote ranches without livestock. The authors of the latter study reported that local ranchers kill beavers because they fear felled trees will block roads. However, beavers are considered keystone species and ecosystem engineers, as their dams raise the water table and turn seasonal stretches of streams into perennial reaches, producing highly beneficial impacts on species abundance and diversity in the riparian zone. Beavers were also documented by Hendrickson et al. in 1978 on the Caj√≥n Bonito.

They play at Links Park in the town of Tain in the Scottish Highlands. The club was formed in 1997, and originally joined the Ross-shire Welfare League that same year. They remained as members of the Ross-shire Welfare until 2018 when they tendered their resignation in favour of moving to the amateur ranks of the North West Sutherland Amateur League. The club was briefly accepted into the senior North Caledonian League in June 2008 and competed in league matches during the 2008-09 season, becoming the first Tain team to do so since the demise of Tain St Duthus four seasons earlier. In 2009-10, Thistle competed in both league and cup competitions, but withdrew in 2010. While members of the North Caledonian League, Tain Thistle and their full squad also appeared in the multi-million selling game series, Football Manager 2009 and featured in several national newspapers for achieving the feat. Achievements=League The club have played in the Ross-shire Welfare League since 1997, and while the club typically finished bottom of the league during its formative years, the club secured its first ever Ross-shire Welfare league title under Arron Christie in 2009, beating Invergordon Social Club on the final day to win by five clear points, ahead of rivals Ross-shire Club. They won the league title for a second time in 2013 under manager Gary Ross, and again in 2015 under Robert Ross. In 2017, under the management of Tony Farquhar, the Jags completed a quadruple haul of trophies, while also securing a third successive Ross-shire Welfare League championship, becoming the first team do so in over 30 years. Leaving the Ross-shire Welfare League after 21 seasons in favour of a move to amateur status, Tain Thistle won the North West Sutherland Amateur League at the first time of asking in 2018. The Jags retained the trophy in 2019. Cups The club won its first trophy in 2007 under the management of Arron Christie, defeating Ross-shire Club to lift the Pattisons' Challenge Cup. In May 2011, Thistle lifted the Ross-shire Welfare League Cup for the first time, defeating Balintore 3‚Äì2 in the final. This result is described as Thistle's greatest performance to date having won after their goalkeeper was given his marching orders on 15-minutes. With no goalkeeper on the bench, it was right-back, Brian Cameron who volunteered to go between the sticks, despite not having played in goals since Primary School. Since that time, Thistle have won every major cup which is competed for under the auspices of the Ross-shire Welfare Football Association. In 2012, the Jags also won the resurrected Mid-Ross Challenge Shield, finishing first in an autumn mini league competition.

A successful amateur, his highest rank in professional sumo was maegashira 1. After his retirement he became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association and established Tagonoura stable. Career He began doing sumo from the age of four, due to his father's love of the sport. He was the first person to earn the amateur yokozuna title whilst still in high school (at which time he already weighed 160 kg), and he continued amateur sumo at Nihon University. In total he captured 28 collegiate sumo titles, a record at the time. He joined the prestigious Dewanoumi stable and made his professional debut in January 1988, beginning in the third highest makushita division. He fought under his own name until he reached the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division, whereupon his shikona was modified slightly from Kushima to Kushimaumi. Although it took him seven tournaments to progress from makushita to j≈´ry≈ç, he won two consecutive y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championships from his j≈´ry≈ç debut to reach the top makuuchi division in July 1989, the first wrestler to do so since 15-day tournaments were established in 1949. In September 1989 he set a new record for consecutive kachi-koshi from makushita tsukedashi debut, with 11. He won his first Fighting Spirit prize in March 1990, and earned two kinboshi for defeating yokozuna Asahifuji in September 1991 and Hokutoumi in March 1992 (this was Hokutoumi's final match before retirement). In March 1993 he was famously knocked out by a harite (slap to the face) from Kyokud≈çzan and had to withdraw from the tournament with his score at seven wins and six losses. His best result in a top division tournament was his runner-up performance in September 1993, where he finished behind Akebono on twelve wins and won his second Fighting Spirit prize. This however, was achieved from the low position of maegashira 13, and despite his great potential he never managed to reach the san'yaku ranks. In his later career he suffered increasingly from shoulder and hip injuries, and was demoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division on several occasions. In November 1998 he was somewhat unfortunate to be demoted to makushita 1 with four wins at what appeared to be a comfortably high rank of j≈´ry≈ç 5 in the previous tournament, as this had never previously happened, but Miyabiyama had won the makushita championship with a perfect 7-0 record from makushita 6 and could not be denied promotion. Kushimaumi chose not to compete in makushita and announced his retirement instead at the age of 33. His danpatsu-shiki or official retirement ceremony was held in May 1999. Fighting style Kushimaumi was one of the heaviest wrestlers ever, weighing over at his peak, and his great physical strength was demonstrated by his frequent use of the kimedashi (arm barring force out) technique. He also regularly employed yorikiri (the force out) and kotenage (the arm lock throw). Retirement from sumo Kushimaumi remained with Dewanoumi stable as an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, initially under his old shikona(known as jun-toshiyori status). In August 1999 he assumed the Tagonoura elder name after the previous holder, ex-komusubi Sadanoumi, left the Sumo Association. In February 2000 he branched out and opened up his own Tagonoura stable. In 2011 he produced his first sekitori ranked wrestler, the Bulgarian Aoiyama. Another former rikishi was the Tongan born Aotsurugi (who took Japanese citizenship to allow Aoiyama to join the stable). He was a judge of tournament bouts from 2006. In 2003 he suffered an acute myocardial infarction, but it proved not to be life- threatening and he made an immediate recovery. He then went on a diet and lost around 60 kilos. As a result, he became interested in healthy cooking and had a series of recipes published in a Kodansha magazine, and his wife released a cookbook in 2008. He died suddenly on 13 February 2012 at the age of 46, of ischaemic heart disease. Aoiyama, Kitanoumi Oyakata, and Dewanoumi Oyakata were among the guests at his funeral in the Kan'ei-ji temple. As there was no- one available to take over, Tagonoura stable was dissolved with his wrestlers split between the Dewanoumi and Kasugano stables. Family Kushimaumi's much younger brother Keita Yoshimura (born 1991) joined Tagonoura stable in 2007 and moved to Dewanoumi stable upon his brother's death, changing his shikona from Aoijo back to his own surname. He is active as of 2019 and has a highest rank of sandanme 72.

About FHFA . absorbing the powers and regulatory authority of both entities, with expanded legal and regulatory authority, including the ability to place government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) into receivership or conservatorship. In its role as regulator, it regulates Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks, or FHLBank System).

Conservatorships  On September 7, 2008, FHFA director Lockhart announced he had put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the FHFA. The action is \\"one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades\\". U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, appearing at the same press conference, stated that placing the two GSEs into conservatorship was a decision he fully supported, and said that he advised \\"that conservatorship was the only form in which I would commit taxpayer money to the GSEs.\\" He further said that \\"I attribute the need for today's action primarily to the inherent conflict and flawed business model embedded in the GSE structure, and to the ongoing housing correction.\\" In the announcement, Lockhart indicated the following items in the plan of action for the conservatorship: # On September 8, 2008, the first day of the conservatorship, business will be conducted normally, with stronger backing for the holders of Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), senior debt and subordinated debt. # The Enterprises will be allowed to grow their guarantee MBS books without limits and continue to purchase replacement securities for their portfolios, about $20 billion per month, without capital constraints. # As the conservator, the FHFA will assume the power of the Board and management. # The present CEOs have been dismissed, but will stay on to help with the transition. # Appointed as CEOs are Herb Allison, for Fannie Mae and David M. Moffett for Freddie Mac. Allison is former Vice Chairman of Merrill Lynch and for the last eight years chairman of TIAA-CREF. Moffett is the former Vice Chairman and CFO of US Bancorp. Their compensation will be significantly lower than the outgoing CEOs. They will be joined by equally strong non-executive chairmen. # Other management action will be very limited. The new CEOs agreed it is important to work with the current management teams and employees to encourage them to stay and to continue to make important improvements to the Enterprises. # To conserve over $2 billion annually in capital the common stock and preferred stock dividends will be eliminated, but the common and all preferred stocks will continue to remain outstanding. Subordinated debt interest and principal payments will continue to be made. # All political activities, including all lobbying, will be halted immediately. Charitable activities will be reviewed. # There will be financing and investing relationship with the U.S. Treasury via three different financing facilities, to provide critically needed support to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and the liquidity of the mortgage market. One of the three facilities is a secured liquidity facility which will be not only for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and also for the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks that FHFA also regulates.  Suits against financial institutions  The FHFA in 2011 filed suit first against UBS then against 17 other financial institutions accusing them of misrepresenting about $200 billion in mortgage- backed securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The suits, some of which name individual defendants, allege a variety of violations of federal securities law and common law and paint \\"a damning portrait of the excesses of the housing bubble.\\" The suits seek a variety of damages and civil penalties.  FHFA settlements for fraudulent sales by PLS to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  The Federal Housing Finance Agency initiated litigation against 18 financial institutions involving allegations of securities law violations and, in some instances, fraud in the sale of private-label securities (PLS) to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

In autumn of 1707, she brought the body of admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell (who had been killed in a disastrous shipwreck in the Isles of Scilly) from St Mary's to Plymouth prior to his burial in Westminster Abbey. Salisbury was rebuilt for the first time by Stacey of Woolwich Dockyard. Unusually, as she was undergoing her rebuild just 10 years after her original launch, she was reconstructed to the same design specifications, and was relaunched on 10 October 1717. Salisbury was the only ship to have been built twice to the same design.Lavery, Ships of the Line vol.1, p79. She was ordered to be taken to pieces for her second rebuild in orders dated 9 April 1725, and was rebuilt at Portsmouth to the 1719 Establishment. Salisbury was relaunched on 30 October 1726. Salisbury was engaged in an action during August 1711, attempting to intercept the homeward- bound Spanish plate fleet, which was expected to arrive at the port of Cartagena, Colombia from Portobelo. The Salisbury formed part of a group of five two-deckers and a sloop under Commodore James Littleton. The British fleet arrived on 6 August chasing five large vessels, but these were able to enter the harbour via the Bocachica entrance. The next morning, another four vessels were chased, and Captain Francis Hosier in the Salisbury, assisted by the Heureux, a French prize previously captured by the Salisbury, engaged the Spanish vice-flagship until Littleton could come up, and the Spaniard later submitted. A further Spanish vessel surrendered to Edward Vernon in the sixty- gun Jersey. The British continued to patrol the environs of Cartagena until forced to abandon the blockade several weeks later, allowing the Spanish vessels to proceed to Havana unhindered. Salisbury was converted to a hulk in 1744, and was sold out of the navy in 1749. NotesReferences *Lavery, Brian (2003) The Ship of the Line - Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650-1850.

It is less common than its relative, Ajuga reptans (common bugle). Description Ajuga genevensis is a perennial plant (flowering between April and July) growing to a height of between 10 and 30 cm.Tomanov√°, 178 Evergreen, it has long-stalked, obovate, basal leaves which are shallowly lobed or toothed. It has an upright stem with flowers arranged in dense, terminal, spike-like inflorescences. The flowers are usually violet-blue, though can be pink or white, and the uppermost flowers are often flushed with blue. When pink, it is sometimes known as \\"pink beauty\\", and when white, it is sometimes known as \\"alba\\". The flowers have short upper-lips with protruding stamens and pistil. The plant sometimes suffers from Erysiphe biocellata, a type of mildew. Relatives Ajuga reptans, a relative with which A. genevensis sometimes interbreeds. Ajuga genevensis is a less common relative of Ajuga reptans, the Common bugle, though it is common for the two plants to interbreed, as well as with Ajuga pyramidalis, the pyramidal bugle, producing hybrid offspring that are very similar.Tomanov√°, 179 Varieties There are also several variants of Ajuga genevensis such as A. genevensis var. arida (a variety with short grey hairs found in mountain meadows) and A. genevensis var. elatior (a mountain plant with randomly hairy stems). Both varieties vary slightly in the shape and size of the leaves and bracts. Distribution Ajuga genevensis is found on the edges of dry woods, as well as in thickets and grasslands. It is found in Europe (from France to western Russia), Turkey and the Caucasus. It is also naturalized in North America, as a result of seeds that have escaped from gardens. It is used as an ornamental plant in gardens worldwide, where it used in edges due to its slower spread compared with A. reptans. Uses Ajuga genevensis herb has been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally as tea for treatment of disorders related with the respiratory tract.

He was a financial executive and private wine collector until a profile published in Wine Spectator in 1997 led him to decide to follow his passion for wine. By 2000, Meadows had left his role of CFO at a publicly traded insurance company and launched the Burghound.com site, which offers subscribers newsletters with reviews of Burgundy wine and California and Oregon Pinot noir wines. Meadows also regularly speaks on Burgundy and other wine subjects. Burghound.com also organizes wine events such as the Asia Symphony of Wine and Flavours - Burghound in Asia, which is held in Singapore. Within a relatively short time following its launch, and despite a relatively high cost of subscription, the service came to be viewed by many as \\"the definitive word on matters Burgundian\\", and Meadows \\"a leading Burgundy critic\\". Among the reasons cited for the success of Burghound.com are that Meadows already held a strong online discussion-group reputation, and that Robert Parker had ceased to cover Burgundy for The Wine Advocate in 1996, and delegated coverage of the region to Pierre Rovani with limited success, providing an opening for Meadows. As Parker already had strained relations with the Burgundy wine community, wine critics of global coverage such as Stephen Tanzer and Clive Coates were perceived to dominate the field. It has been suggested that the Burghound coverage of the 2005 vintage of Burgundy did as much to Meadows' reputation as 1982 Bordeaux did for Robert Parker. In 2010, Meadows and his wife Erica self-published a book entitled The Pearl of the C√¥te on the subject of the history and vineyards of Vosne-Roman√©e, while opting not to list the book on channels such as Amazon.com.Robinson, Jancis, Financial Times (July 23, 2010).

Its fleet was sold by the Tilden family to National Car Rental of the United States in June 1996. History=Origin In 1925, Sam Tilden (1897‚Äì1973), a shoe salesman in Montreal, bought the Hertz Rent-a-Car franchise for Montreal after reading an advertisement in the Saturday Evening Post. Tilden started the business with three Chrysler cars and a loan from his father. In 1929, Hertz took the franchise back from Tilden, believing that it could make more money through direct ownership. In 1932, Tilden had won the franchise back from Hertz. 1950s By 1950, Sam Tilden had three Hertz franchises: Montreal, Ottawa and Hamilton, Ontario, and his son, Walter Tilden (1928‚Äì2008), was managing the Ottawa franchise. Through the 1950s, Tilden Rent-a-Car expanded rapidly, taking advantage of its independence from car manufacturers. The Victoria, British Columbia franchise was managed by Sam's youngest son, Ted Tilden (1931‚Äì1991). The franchise agreement with Hertz allowed the American company to take back a franchise on 60 days notice, and head office insisted that American advertising copy be used in Canada, although the Canadian franchisees wanted to use copy more appropriate for Canada. In 1953, Sam Tilden and several other franchises, objecting to these policies, left Hertz and set up the Tilden Rent-a-Car System. By 1954, there were 100 Tilden locations throughout Canada. 1960s In the 1960s, recognizing the opportunities for cross-promotion, Tilden formed a partnership with National Car Rental in the United States. Tilden and National established a joint venture, 50% owned by each company, in Europe under the Europcar name. Tilden later entered into a similar joint venture with Nippon Rent-a-Car of Japan to set up rental agencies in Asia. By the mid-1960s, Tilden Rent-a-Car System had 2,000 corporate-owned vehicles and 2,500 vehicles owned by independent franchise operators in Canada. 1970s Sam Tilden died of a heart attack in 1973, and the company leadership was taken over by his sons Walter and Ted. In 1974, the company's head office was moved from Montreal to Toronto. Tanker crash, lawsuits, and sale On 6 March 1991, Ted Tilden, who owned 50% of the company, died of a heart attack. Two months later, a Tilden car was involved in an accident in the Bronx, New York City, with a gasoline tanker truck that resulted in a dozen stores burning and explosions in nearby parked cars. This accident played a significant role in the ultimate sale of Tilden Rent-a-Car to National. In 1992, the name of the company was changed to Tilden InterRent to emphasise its connections to National and Europcar, and National's green colour scheme replaced the red, blue and green scheme that Tilden had been using. The Bronx accident led to dozens of claims against the company including suits for wrongful death. The company that owned the gas tanker did not have sufficient insurance, and the plaintiffs sought compensation from Tilden. In June 1995, shortly after his appearance in a wide-ranging corporate and industry interview feature on Montreal's CF Cable 9 Television's Travel World 95 public affairs show, Walter Tilden began negotiations to sell the company. In July 1995, Tilden's car leasing operations were sold to Newcourt Credit Group. In February 1996, Walter Tilden retired as president and chief executive officer, and was succeeded by his niece Patricia Tilden. Tilden InterRent sought protection under the Companies‚Äô Creditors Arrangement in April 1996 to protect it from the 17 lawsuits it was facing from the Bronx accident. The lawsuits had been consolidated into one suit, causing the company's bankers to become nervous. In June 1996, a U.S. judge ruled that Tilden could be held liable, and within a week, Tilden's fleet had been sold to National for $115 million. National agreed to take on 95% of Tilden's staff, and operate in Canada as \\"National Tilden\\". Although many locations continue to use the National Tilden name, the parent company's name was changed to \\"National\\" shortly thereafter. The lawsuit arising from the Bronx accident that led to the demise of Tilden as an independent Canadian company was later dismissed.

Jones was born on 18 April 1896 at Woolstone Farm, near St Clears, Carmarthenshire. In 1913, Jones enlisted in the Territorial Army, though he was soon transferred into the newly established Royal Flying Corps, serving as an air mechanic on ground duties (where he earned the Military Medal) before volunteering for flying duties as an Observer. Jones commenced pilot training in August 1917 after being commissioned. After completing his training he joined No. 74 Squadron. Throughout his service at No. 74 Squadron Jones won several awards and decorations; being awarded the Military Cross, the Distinguished Flying Cross and bar and the Distinguished Service Order. Although having a reputation for crashing his aircraft when attempting to land, Jones recorded 37 victories in just 3 months whilst flying the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 during the First World War. After retiring in 1936, Jones was recommissioned after the outbreak of the Second World War, and flew briefly during the Battle of Britain. After retiring again at the end of the Second World War, Jones lived in Wales where he wrote three books on the RFC and RAF. He died in 1960 through complications after a fall at his home in Wales. Career Jones was born on 18 April 1896 at Woolstone Farm, near St. Clears, Carmarthenshire. He was illegitimate, a fact he concealed throughout his life. He is known to have had a stutter, reportedly acquired after being rolled down a hill in a barrel as a child. First World War In 1913, while working as a clerk, Jones enlisted with the 4th Welsh in the Territorial Army. Jones was in London studying Wireless and Cable Telegraphy when the First World War started. Awaiting call-up, Jones joined the fledgling Royal Flying Corps, and after training joined No. 10 Squadron RAF as a 1st Class Air Mechanic in the wireless section. Jones was posted to France in July 1915. By January 1916 he was flying combat missions as an observer/gunner on BE-2's, winning his Observer's brevet in October 1916. Jones was awarded the Military Medal in May 1916, for rescuing two wounded gunners under artillery fire whilst he was working at a wireless interception station in the front line. He was awarded the Russian Order of the Cross of St. George in January 1917 after receiving several commendations for bravery. In May 1917 he was sent to England to commence pilot training and he was commissioned in August 1917. After completing his training, Jones was posted to No. 74 Squadron, where he formed a friendship with one of the flight commanders, Captain Edward \\"Mick\\" Mannock, and it was with this Squadron that he earned his decorations for bravery. Jones was awarded several decorations during the First World War. These included the Military Cross and two Distinguished Flying Crosses. On 3 August 1918, the London Gazette announced that Jones was to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for the following citation: \\"In eleven days this officer attacked and destroyed six enemy aeroplanes, displaying great courage, skill and initiative.\\" In September 1918 Jones was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read: Later on in the same month, Jones was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross. The Gazette described Jones as being a \\"A gallant officer who in the last three months has destroyed twenty-one enemy aeroplanes.\\" In November 1918, Jones was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His citation read: In June 1918, Jones became a flight commander. On 30 July he shot down an LVG two seater flying a badly damaged SE-5a, which collapsed on landing. Throughout his service career, Jones had a reputation for crashing his aircraft when attempting to land, reportedly surviving (relatively unscathed) some 28 flying accidents of varying severity. By the end of the War though, he had scored 37 victories in just 3 months whilst flying the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 with 74 Squadron in France. His 37 claims consisted of 1 balloon destroyed, 28 (and 1 shared) aircraft destroyed, and 6 (and 1 shared) \\"down out of control\\". After the Armistice he became Commanding Officer of No. 74 Squadron until it was disbanded in 1919. Quotes Jones was once quoted as saying: \\"It is wonderful how cheered a pilot becomes after he shoots down his first machine; his morale increases by at least 100 percent.\\" \\"My habit of attacking Huns dangling from their parachutes led to many arguments in the mess. Some officers, of the Eton and Sandhurst type, thought it was 'unsportsmanlike' to do it. Never having been to a public school, I was unhampered by such considerations of form. I just pointed out that there was a bloody war on, and that I intended to avenge my pals.\\" Vic Hand served as an armourer under Jones' command at 53 OTU in 1941 and 1942, and recalls: \\"Taffy designed an unofficial badge for 53 OTU by adding wings to the tiger head of his 74 Squadron, but I cannot recall the motto. Maybe it was in Welsh. He had a habit of raising his drinking arm to the horizontal when toasting 'One f-f-for the T-t-tiger' in his unfortunate but endearing stutter. Likewise when referring to we, his ground staff, as 'm-my m-mechanics'.\\" Post-war After the end of hostilities, Jones volunteered to fight with the White movement against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War and was posted to the Archangel front, but saw no further air combat. In 1919, he received a permanent commission in the RAF in the rank of flying officer, and was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 July 1924. He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 February 1935, and voluntarily retired on 9 July 1936. Second World War Sources are uncertain as to the extent of Jones' service in the Second World War. One of his obituaries quotes a story from 1939 when, at the age of 45, Jones tried to get into the Royal Air Force at Windsor Castle. King George VI told him: \\"You are too old, Taffy. It's a young man's game.\\" Jones' age notwithstanding, he was recalled in August 1939 as Chief Signals Officer, Training Command Headquarters. By July, acting Wing Commander Jones was OC No. 7 Bombing and Gunnery School, RAF Porthcawl. It was here that one of his most famed actions occurred when, whilst flying an unarmed Hawker Henley near Swansea, he attacked a Junkers Ju 88 bomber with a Very pistol, a type of flare gun. His actions were enough to fight off the Junkers, which returned to its base. On 1 September, he was promoted to the temporary rank of wing commander, with the service number 04084. After a spell in charge of 57 OTU at Hawarden in January 1941, Jones was given the task of forming No 59 OTU at Turnhouse, near Edinburgh, and then sent to command No 53 OTU Heston, Middlesex. He reportedly flew several unofficial operations in a Spitfire, taking part in several fighter sweeps over Europe. Later life After the war he returned to St Clears and a career in the Ministry of Pensions. Jones wrote three books, two of them between the wars; King of Air Fighters, a biography of Edward Mannock, Tiger Squadron a history of 74 Squadron, and An Air Fighter's Scrapbook. Jones died on 30 August 1960 after a fall at home in Aberaeron, and was buried at Cana Chapelyard, near Bancyfelin. There is also a special commemoration to Jones by St Clears War Memorial which he had unveiled.

The term statistics comes from the New Latin statisticum collegium (council of state) and refers to science of the state. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, official statistics are statistics disseminated by the national statistical system, excepting those that are explicitly not to be official\\".OECD. Online Glossary of Statistical Terms http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/index.htm Governmental agencies at all levels, including municipal, county, and state administrations, may generate and disseminate official statistics. This broader possibility is accommodated by later definitions. For example: Official statistics result from the collection and processing of data into statistical information by a government institution or international organisation. They are then disseminated to help users develop their knowledge about a particular topic or geographical area, make comparisons between countries or understand changes over time. Official statistics make information on economic and social development accessible to the public, allowing the impact of government policies to be assessed, thus improving accountability. Aim Official statistics provide a picture of a country or different phenomena through data, and images such as graph and maps. Statistical information covers different subject areas (economic, demographic, social etc.). It provides basic information for decision making, evaluations and assessments at different levels. The goal of statistical organizations is to produce relevant, objective and accurateSee Point 3 in Assessment of the quality in statistics - Eurostat http://www.unece.org/stats/documents/2000/11/metis/crp.2.e.pdf statistics to keep users well informed and assist good policy and decision-making. Various categories The Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics were adopted in 1992 by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and subsequently endorsed as a global standard by the United Nations Statistical Commission. According to the first Principle \\"Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation\\".Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics http://www.unece.org/stats/archive/docs.fp.e.html The categorization of the domains of official statistics has been further developed in the Classification of Statistical Activities, endorsed by the Conference of European Statisticians and various other bodies.Classification of Statistical Activities Most common indicators used in official statistics Statistical indicators provide an overview of the social, demographic and economic structure of society. Moreover, these indicators facilitate comparisons between countries and regions. For population, the main indicators are: * Total population * Population density * Population by age * Life expectancy at birth and at age 65 * Foreign born * Foreigners in population * Total fertility rate * Infant mortality The gender statistics include: * Women in labour force * Gender pay gapSee The gender pay gap - European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2006/101/en/1/ef06101en.pdf In the employment  * Employment rate * Unemployment rate * Youth unemployment rate * Economic activity rate (women and men) * Employment in major sectors: agriculture, industry, services There are many indicators for the economy: * Gross Domestic Product * Gross Domestic Product per capita * Real GDP growth rate * GDP by major economic sectors: agriculture, industry, services * Consumer price index * Purchasing Power Parity * Exchange rate * Gross external debt For trade indicators we find: * Exports of goods and services * Imports of goods and services * Balance of paymentsSee Chapter II Balance Payments Manual - IMF http://imf.org/external/np/sta/bop/BOPman.pdf * Trade balance * Major import partners * Major export partners Environment indicators: * Land use * Water supply and consumption * Environmental protection expenditure * Generation and treatment of waste * Chemical use For the energy field: * Total energy consumption * Primary energy sources * Energy consumption in transport * Electricity consumption * Consumption of renewable energy sources Users The three user types of official statistics Official statistics are intended for a wide range of users including governments (central and local), research institutions, professional statisticians, journalists and the media, businesses, educational institutions and the general public. There are three types of users: those with a general interest, business interest or research interest. Each of these user groups has different needs for statistical information. Users with a general interest Users with a general interest include the media, schools and the general public. They use official statistics in order to be informed on a particular topic, to observe trends within the society of a local area, country, region of the world. Users with a business interest Users with a business interest include decision makers and users with a particular interest for which they want more detailed information. For them, official statistics are an important reference, providing information on the phenomena or circumstances their own work is focusing on. For instance, those users will take some official statistics into consideration before launching a product, or deciding on a specific policy or on a marketing strategy. As with the general interest users, this group does not usually have a good understanding of statistical methodologies, but they need more detailed information than the general users. Users with a research interest Users with a research interest are universities, consultants and government agencies. They generally understand something about statistical methodology and want to dig deeper into the facts and the statistical observations; they have an analytical purpose in inventing or explaining interrelations of causes and effects of different phenomena. In this field, official statistics are also used to assess a government's policies. One common point for all these users is their need to be able to trust the official information. They need to be confident that the results published are authoritative and unbiased. Producers of official statistics must maintain a reputation of professionalism and independence. The statistical system must be free from interference that could influence decisions on the choice of sources, methods used for data collection, the selection of results to be released as official, and the timing and form of dissemination. Statistical business processes should be transparent and follow international standards of good practice. Statistical programs are decided on an annual or multi-annual basis by governments in many countries. They also provide a way to judge the performance of the statistical system. Producers at the national level Official statistics are collected and produced by national statistical organisations (NSOs), or other organisations (e.g. central banks) that form part of the national statistical system in countries where statistical production is de-centralized. These organisations are responsible for producing and disseminating official statistical information, providing the highest quality data. Quality in the context of official statistics is a multi-faceted concept, consisting of components such as relevance, completeness, timeliness, accuracy, accessibility, clarity, cost- efficiency, transparency, comparability and coherence. The core tasks of NSOs, for both centralized and decentralized systems, are determining user needs and filtering these for relevance. Then they transform the relevant user needs into measurable concepts to facilitate data collection and dissemination. The NSO is in charge of the coordination between statistical producers and of ensuring the coherence and compliance of the statistical system to agreed standards. The NSO has a coordination responsibility as its President/Director General represents the entire national system of official statistics, both at the national and at international levels. Production process The production process of official statistics comprises 8 phases, as documented in the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM) * Specify Needs * Design * Build * Collect * Process * Analyse * Disseminate * Evaluate Data revision Even after they have been published, some official statistics may be revised. Policy-makers may need preliminary statistics quickly for decision-making purposes, but eventually it is important to publish the best available information, so official statistics are often published in several 'vintages'. In order to understand the accuracy of economic data and the possible impact of data errors on macroeconomic decision-making, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has published a dataset that records both initial real-time data estimates, and subsequent data revisions, for a large number of macroeconomic series. A similar dataset for Europe has been developed by the Euro-Area Business Cycle Network. Data Sources There are two sources of data for statistics. Primary, or \\"statistical\\" sources are data that are collected primarily for creating official statistics, and include statistical surveys and censuses. Secondary, or \\"non-statistical\\" sources, are data that have been primarily collected for some other purpose (administrative data, private sector data etc.). Statistical survey or sample survey A statistical survey or a sample survey is an investigation about the characteristics of a phenomenon by means of collecting data from a sample of the population and estimating their characteristics through the systematic use of statistical methodology. ** The main advantages are the direct control over data collection and the possibility to ask for data according to statistical definitions. ** Disadvantages include the high cost of data collection and the quality issues relating to non-response and survey errors. There are various survey methods that can be used such as direct interviewing, telephone, mail, online surveys. Census A census is a complete enumeration of a population or groups at a point in time with respect to well-defined characteristics (population, production). Data are collected for a specific reference period. A census should be taken at regular intervals in order to have comparable information available, therefore, most statistical censuses are conducted every 5 or 10 years. Data are usually collected through questionnaires mailed to respondents, via the Internet, or completed by an enumerator visiting respondents, or contacting them by telephone. ** An advantage is that censuses provide better data than surveys for small geographic areas or sub-groups of the population. Census data can also provide a basis for sampling frames used in subsequent surveys. ** The major disadvantage of censuses is usually the high cost associated with planning and conducting them, and processing the resulting data. In 2005, the United Nations Economic and Social Council adopted a resolution urging: \\"Member States to carry out a population and housing census and to disseminate census results as an essential source of information for small area, national, regional and international planning and development; and to provide census results to national stakeholders as well as the United Nations and other appropriate intergovernmental organizations to assist in studies on population, environment, and socio-economic development issues and programs\\". Register A register is a database that is updated continuously for a specific purpose and from which statistics can be collected and produced. It contains information on a complete group of units. ** An advantage is the total coverage even if collecting and processing represent low cost. It allows producing more detailed statistics than using surveys. Different registers can be combined and linked together on the basis of defined keys (personal identification codes, business identification codes, address codes etc.). Moreover, individual administrative registers are usually of high quality and very detailed. ** A disadvantage is the possible under-coverage that can be the case if the incentive or the cultural tradition of registering events and changes are weak, if the classification principles of the register are not clearly defined or if the classifications do not correspond to the needs of statistical production to be derived from them. There are different types of registers: ‚ÜíAdministrative registers or records can help the NSI in collecting data. Using the existing administrative data for statistical production may be approved by the public because it can be seen as a cost efficient method; individuals and enterprises are less harassed by a response burden; data security is better as fewer people handle it and data have an electronic format. ‚ÜíPrivate registers such as registers operated by insurance companies and employer organizations can also be used in the production process of official statistics, providing there is an agreement or legislation on this. ‚ÜíStatistical registers are frequently based on combined data from different administrative registers or other data sources. ‚ÜíFor businesses, it is often legally indispensable to be registered in their country to a business register which is a system that makes business information collection easier. ‚ÜíIt is possible to find agricultural registers and registers of dwellings. Even though different types of data collection exist, the best estimates are based on a combination of different sources providing the strengths and reducing the weakness of each individual source. Official Statistics presentation Official statistics can be presented in different ways. Analytical texts and tables are the most traditional ways. Graphs and charts summarize data highlighting information content visually. They can be extremely effective in expressing key results, or illustrating a presentation. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. Graphs and charts usually have a heading describing the topic. There are different types of graphic but usually the data determine the type that is going to be used. * To illustrate changes over time, a line graph would be recommended. This is usually used to display variables whose values represent a regular progression. Stacked bar chart showing the sectoral contribution to total business services growth, 2001-2005 for members of UNECE. * For categorical data, it is better to use a bar graph either vertical or horizontal. They are often used to represent percentages and rates and also to compare countries, groups or illustrate changes over time. The same variable can be plotted against itself for two groups. An example of this is the age pyramid. * Pie chart can be used to represent share of 100 per cent. Pie charts highlight the topic well only when there are few segments. * Stacked bar charts, whether vertical or horizontal, are used to compare compositions across categories. They can be used to compare percentage composition and are most effective for categories that add up to 100 per cent, which make a full stacked bar chart. Their use is usually restricted to a small number of categories. * Tables are a complement to related texts and support the analysis. They help to minimize numbers in the description and also eliminate the need to discuss small variables that are not essential. Tables rank data by order or other hierarchies to make the numbers easily understandable. They usually show the figures from the highest to the lowest. * Another type of visual presentation of statistical information is thematic map. They can be used to illustrate differences or similarities between geographical areas, regions or countries. The most common statistical map that is used is called the choropleth map where different shades of a colour are used to highlight contrasts between regions; darker colour means a greater statistical value. This type of map is best used for ratioSee paragraph 4.5 in Data and Metadata reporting and Presentation Handbook - OECD http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/17/37671574.pdf data but for other data, proportional or graduated symbol maps, such as circles, are preferred. The size of the symbol increases in proportion to the value of the observed object. Release Official statistics are part of our everyday life. They are everywhere: in newspapers, on television and radio, in presentations and discussions. For most citizens, the media provide their only exposure to official statistics. Television is the primary news source for citizens in industrialized countries, even if radio and newspapers still play an important role in the dissemination of statistical information. On the other hand, newspapers and specialized economic and social magazines can provide more detailed coverage of statistical releases as the information on a specific theme can be quite extensive. Official statistics provides us with important information on the situation and the development trends in our society. Users can gather information making use of the services of the National Statistical Offices. They can easily find it on the agency's website. The development of computing technologies and the Internet has enabled users - businesses, educational institutions and households among others- to have access to statistical information. The Internet has become an important tool for statistical producers to disseminate their data and information. People are able to access information online. The supply of information from statistical agencies has increased. Today the advanced agencies provide the information on their websites in an understandable way, often categorized for different groups of users. Several glossaries have been set up by different organizations or statistical offices to provide more information and definitions in the field of statistics and consequently official statistics. Quality criteria to be respected The quality criteria of a national statistical office are the following: relevance, impartiality, dissemination, independence, transparency, confidentiality, international standards . There principles apply not only to the NSO but to all producers of official statistics. Therefore, not every figure reported by a public body should be considered as official statistics, but those produced and disseminated according to the principles. Adherence to these principles will enhance the credibility of the NSO and other official statistical producers and build public trust in the reliability of the information and results that are produced. Relevance Relevance is the first and most important principles to be respected for national statistical offices. When releasing information, data and official statistics should be relevant in order to fulfil the needs of users as well as both public and private sector decision makers. Production of official statistics is relevant if it corresponds to different user needs like public, governments, businesses, research community, educational institutions, NGOs and international organizations or if it satisfies basic information in each area and citizen's right to information. Impartiality Once the survey has been made, the NSO checks the quality of the results and then they have to be disseminated no matter what impact they can have on some users, whether good or bad. All should accept the results released by the NSO as authoritative. Users need to perceive the results as unbiased representation of relevant aspects of the society. Moreover, the impartiality principle implies the fact that NSOs have to use understandable terminology for statistics' dissemination, questionnaires and material published so that everyone can have access to their information. Dissemination In order to maximize dissemination, statistics should be presented in a way that facilitates proper interpretation and meaningful comparisons. To reach the general public and non-expert users when disseminating, NSOs have to add explanatory comments to explain the significance of the results released and make analytical comments when necessary. There is a need to identify clearly what the preliminary, final and revised results are, in order to avoid confusion for users. All results of official statistics have to be publicly accessible. There are no results that should be characterized as official and for the exclusive use of the government. Moreover, they should be disseminated simultaneously. Independence Users can be consulted by NSOs but the decisions should be made by statistical bodies. Information and activities of producers of official statistics should be independent of political control. Moreover, NSOs have to be free of any political interference that could influence their work and thus, the results. They should not make any political advice or policy- perspective comments on the results released at any time, even at press conferences or in interviews with the media. Transparency The need for transparency is essential for NSOs to gain the trust of the public. They have to expose to the public the methods they use to produce official statistics, and be accountable for all the decisions they take and the results they publish. Also, statistical producers should warn users of certain interpretations and false conclusions even if they try to be as precise as possible. Furthermore, the quality of the accurate and timely results must be assessed prior to release. But if errors in the results occur before or after the data revision,See Data Review/Data Checking in Glossary of Terms on Statistical Data Editing ‚Äì UNECE http://www.unece.org/stats/publications/editingglossary.pdf they should be directly corrected and information should be disseminated to the users at the earliest possible time. Producers of official statistics have to set analytical systems in order to change or improve their activities and methods. Confidentiality All data collected by the national statistical office must protect the privacy of individual respondents, whether persons or businesses. But on the contrary, government units such as institutions cannot invoke statistical confidentiality. All respondents have to be informed about the purpose and legal basis of the survey and especially about the confidentiality measures. The statistical office should not release any information that could identify an individual or group without prior consent. After data collection, replies should go back directly to the statistical producer, without involving any intermediary. Data processing implies that filled-in paper and electronic form with full names should be destroyed. International standards The use of international standards at the national level aims to improve international comparability for national users and facilitate decision-making, especially when controversial. Moreover, the overall structure, including concepts and definitions, should follow internationally accepted standards, guidelines or good practices. International recommendations and standards for statistical methods approved by many countries provide them with a common basis like the two standards of the International Monetary Fund, SDDS for Special Data Dissemination Standards and GDDS for General Data Dissemination System. Their aim is to guide countries in the dissemination of their economic and financial data to the public. Once approved, these standards have to be observed by all producers of official statistics and not only by the NSO.

Family & education Hodge was the son Archibald Hodge of Hoole Park, Chester who had been miner in Fife. He was educated at the former Chester Cathedral Choir School. The school closed in 1975.Chester Cathedral Choir School at www.ccoca.co.uk He qualified as a chartered accountant and practised in Chester from the age of 21 but he relinquished this profession in favour of the law and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1917 and practiced law on the Northern Circuit. In the same year he married Anna Fortun√©e the daughter of Michel Venture a shipowner from Marseille. They had a daughter and a son. His wife died in 1944. Military service Before the First World War Hodge served as a private in the Inns of Court Officers' Training Corps. He later obtained a commission in the Army Pay Department and went to France in 1914. He also served in Salonika and Egypt. He was subsequently appointed Inspector of Pay Offices with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Politics Hodge was Liberal MP for Preston from 1922 to 1924. Preston was a two-member seat at that time. In the 1922 general election the Labour candidate topped the poll, with Hodge taking the second seat from the sitting Conservative member, George Frederick Stanley.The Times, 16.11.22 At the general election of 1923, each of the political parties decided to stand only one candidate. The Tories thought seriously about putting up two candidates in the two member constituency on the grounds that this would have split the anti-Tory vote for the second seat and would have strongly discouraged their supporters from using the second vote for a Liberal or Labour candidate.The Times 24.11.23 In the event, Hodge held his seat. 1923-24 saw the arrival of the first Labour government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The Conservatives had won the most seats but had lost their overall majority. The general election produced a hung parliament and Labour took office as a minority administration with the support of the Liberals. However their position was precarious and although the Liberals were desperate to avoid a third general election in three years, it was Liberal action in Parliament which started the process which led the downfall of the government. Hodge, however, was one of 12 rebel Liberals who supported the government in the crucial parliamentary vote of October 1924 which in effect brought about the end of the first Labour government.Roy Douglas, The History of the Liberal Party, 1895-1970; Sidgwick & Jackson, 1971 p180 It was not enough to ensure he held his seat however as he lost at Preston at the 1924 general election, his seat being taken by a Conservative. At first he remained as Liberal parliamentary candidate for Preston but gave up citing ill health in 1927.The Times, 14.10.27 However he seems to have been well enough to carry on his legal practice at least until 1929.The Times, 8.5.29, 5.7.29 & 11.7.29 Outside Parliament Hodge took part in sculling, played golf and took a strong interest in Theology.

Plot Gideon Banks, an electronic engineer, twenty years ago lost his wife Liz and son Simon in a horrific car crash. At that period of time he was working at the so-called Neural Archiving Project ‚Äî NAP for short. This technology was developed to create smart computers by transferring human engrams into computers. The company eventually gave up on the technology, but Gideon didn't. After years of quietly perfecting it, he built at home a small robot, using parts he stole from Concorde Robotics, where he now works. Zoe, Gideon's niece, discovers Gideon's secret, that the robot contains actual neural engrams from Gideon's dead son Simon, which Gideon has integrated into the robot in hopes of re-creating his son. And now, the robot actually has memories of the real Simon. Zoe becomes worried not only about Gideon but also about the robot that sounds and acts a lot like her little cousin used to. And she begins to realize that Simon may not have been the lovable little angel that everyone believed he was. \\"Simon\\" becomes more and more demanding, putting pressure on Gideon, who could lose his job. When he asks Zoe to \\"babysit,\\" the robot attacks during a tantrum and injures her. When Gideon returns they argue about \\"Simon\\" being a robot or as Gideon insists, a true boy. Zoe leaves upset. Later, Gideon apologizes over the phone and asks her to look after Simon again as he has to work. Zoe does so, but this time gets along much better with \\"Simon\\" who also apologizes for hurting her. Gideon's boss finds out about the robot, and claims that since it was built from company equipment, it belongs to the company. When he tries to forcibly take \\"Simon\\" away, Gideon becomes enraged and clubs the man on the head, killing him. Gideon and Zoe begin to argue, but \\"Simon\\", who becomes distraught at recognizing the seriousness of the situation, shouts for them to stop and claims that he is ultimately the one at fault. Upset, \\"Simon\\" confesses that \\"he\\" was responsible for the car crash: when Liz refused to take Simon to the toy store, Simon threw a temper tantrum and grabbed the steering wheel, causing the fatal crash. To him, that unwise tantrum was the first domino to start the chain reaction that has now led to this moment. Realizing what he's done could seriously impact Zoe, Gideon ushers her out, assuring her that he'll remedy the situation and do the right thing without affecting her. Soon afterwards, Zoe hears a gunshot and rushes back in, only to discover that Gideon has copied his own mind into another robot before committing suicide.

Here he also joined the Literary and Philosophical Society. In 1822, Thomas Pringle persuaded him to emigrate to Cape Town, promising a literary and teaching career in the recently annexed Cape Colony. Newspaper proprietor Fairbairn arrived in Table Bay on 11 October 1823 aboard the brig Mary. The Cape at the time was under the authoritarian control of the British Governor Lord Charles Somerset. Both the school and the scientific society which Pringle and Fairbairn tried to establish, both were obstructed and shut in 1824-1825 because of the Governor's disapproval of their activities. With Pringle, he then turned to editing. Together they founded a periodical, the South African Journal in 1824, but the Governor closed it in the same year. They then founded another periodical, the New Organ in 1826 but it immediately suffered the same fate. The Commercial Advertiser He and Pringle had been invited by George Greig in January 1824 to take over the editing of The South African Commercial Advertiser, southern Africa's first private and independent newspaper. The Governor censored the paper in May 1824, due to the reporting of a libel case that the Governor was already involved in. The newspaper reopened in 1825 with Fairbairn as the only editor, and he continued until 1859. He became sole owner too in 1835, when he purchased Greig's shares. The newspaper faced further suppression, and in 1827 Fairbairn travelled to London to seek justice. He was given permission to open the newspaper again, but only if he avoided all controversy regarding politics or public persons. By this time, Fairbairn had acquired a considerable following among the normal citizens of the Cape Colony. In 1829, the press was given freedom from the Governor's control, but still were bound by strong libel rules. Three decades later in 1859, Fairbairn was eventually to help pass the bill in parliament to end these restrictions. Fairbairn was strongly liberal, and had been a radical abolitionist in his early career. Via his newspaper, he publicly maintained that most conflict on the frontier was entirely the fault of the colonists, not of the Xhosa, and he advocated equal treaties with the Xhosa states based on international law. He therefore supported the frontier policy of Andries Stockenstrom which aspired to establish exactly that. In the mid-1830s, the Commercial Advertiser, representing the Cape Town liberals, was engaged in a \\"newspaper war\\" with the main newspaper of the conservative eastern frontier, Robert Godlonton's Grahamstown Journal. The country's main Dutch newspaper, De Zuid Afrikaan ended up siding with the Grahamstown Journal. In spite of the pressure, Fairbairn maintained his position of siding with the Xhosa, up until the outbreak of the 7th Frontier War (1846), when the circumstances of its outbreak led him to become disillusioned and pessimistic regarding the entire frontier situation. He even publicly condemned the Xhosa chiefs for their actions. Family life right Fairbairn married Elizabeth (Eliza) Philip, daughter of John Philip on 24 May 1831. Fairbairn's wife, Eliza, died on 30 May 1840, four days after the birth of May Emma, at the age of twenty-eight. Fairbairn never remarried, and spent the remainder of his life as a widower. Five children were born to Fairbairn and Eliza. *Jane Agnes b. 1832. m. F.S. Watermeyer; the parents of Ben Watermeyer and several other MPs. *John Philip b. 1834.

As a widower, Fairbairn was responsible for the education of his children. Jane and Eliza were sent to a private school in Claremont, Mrs Rose's School for Ladies. Political career=The convict ship (1849-50) The British Government made an attempt in 1849 to form a penal settlement at the Cape, but when the ship Neptune arrived at Simon's Bay, with 282 convicts aboard, the citizens protested and boycotted any persons or institutions having dealings with her. Fairbairn became Secretary of the \\"Anti-Convict Association\\" which formed in May 1849 under the leadership of Hercules Jarvis and other local leaders. Fairbairn led a radical faction however, which fought to ensure that no supplies whatsoever was obtainable, either for the convicts or for the troops. A few months later, Fairbairn's actions caused the Chairman and moderates of the Association to resign, and left Fairbairn for a while as the sole leader of the association in Cape Town. Riots and public disorder ensued. During the riots, Fairbairn was even attacked and assaulted in his house at Sea Point by government thugs, who also wrecked his house. In the end the colonists were victorious, and on 21 February 1850, the Neptune set sail for Tasmania.Nelson‚Äôs GuidesRFM Immelman: Men of Good Hope, 1804-1954. CTCC: Cape Town, 1955. Chapter 6 The Anti-convict Agitation. p.154. Fight for Representative Government (1850-1854) Fairbairn was deeply involved in the struggle by the local Cape citizens to attain \\"Representative Government\\" in the form of an elected Parliament. In 1850, Fairbairn was popularly elected to the small and relatively powerless \\"Legislative Council\\", together with three other local leaders. However the Governor Harry Smith added an additional, un- elected member, Fairbairn's old enemy the conservative Robert Godlonton, who favoured greater Imperial control over southern Africa. Conflict ensued, as Fairbairn (supported by the other elected or \\"popular\\" members) condemned the move and asked that the Council be suspended until it could be re-constituted as a proper, fully elected and representative council. Fairbairn also argued against any property qualification for election (franchise qualifications were however the norm at the time). Eventually the four \\"popular members\\" published their \\"Eleven Reasons\\" for their protest, and resigned. Encouraged by the Cape Town municipality, they met with other popularly elected leaders, and drew up a draft constitution (\\"The Sixteen Articles\\"). Fairbairn and Stockenstrom then travelled to London to get approval of the constitution, but was unsuccessful. Member of the First Parliament (1854-1864) When the Cape finally obtained a Parliament in 1854, Fairbairn was immediately elected as a member of the Assembly (lower house) representing Swellendam. He held this seat for ten years, up until his death in 1864. He was initially proposed as Speaker of the first Parliament, but narrowly lost to Christoffel Brand. He was also an early supporter of the move for \\"responsible government\\" - the next step in the Cape's gradual independence, which entailed an elected Executive. Later, the first Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, John Molteno, hailed John Fairbairn as father of representative government and freedom of the press in the Cape.P. A. Molteno: The life and times of Sir John Charles Molteno, K. C. M. G., First Premier of Cape Colony, Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape. London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1900 Death and legacy In 1859 Fairbairn gave up his journalistic work and editorship of the Commercial Advertiser. His other contributions included the building of hard roads over the sands of the Cape flats, the first life- saving boat to operate around the Cape peninsula and the introducing of the Jury system. However it is as a tireless fighter for press freedom that he is most remembered. His role as the leader of the free and liberal press of the Cape was taken over by Saul Solomon, and his newspaper the Cape Argus. Death (1864) Fairbairn died suddenly in Cape Town on 5 October 1864 at the Wynberg home of his son-in-law, advocate Frank Watermeyer, and was buried in the Somerset Road cemetery in Cape Town. Watermeyer died in the same year, having dutifully taken on Fairbairn's many debts.Trapido Stanley, ‚ÄòFairbairn, John (1794‚Äì1864)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2006 Before the levelling of the Somerset Road Cemetery and building started on the site in about 1922, a number of inscribed stones were lifted from their graves and deposited at the Woltemade cemetery at Maitland which had been opened as Cape Town's principal graveyard in 1886. Here can be found the stones of John Fairbairn, his wife Elizabeth and other members of the Fairbairn and Philip families. Descendants In 1947 the British Government decided to give Marion Island and Prince Edward Island to South Africa, to prevent them falling into hostile hands. HMSAS Transvaal was dispatched in great secrecy, and on 4 January 1948, Lieutenant Commander John Fairbairn, great grandson of John Fairbairn, landed on Prince Edward Island and claimed the islands for South Africa. The meteorological station is known as Fairbairn Settlement and is on Transvaal Cove. In 2007, Fairbairn's great great great granddaughter, Tessa Fairbairn, was awarded the Order of Simon of Cyrene. She was the head of St. Cyprian's School, a progressive girls‚Äô boarding and day school in Cape Town, South Africa for 17 years.

He enlisted early in the war and then was appointed colonel of a regiment of infantry. He was promoted to general in command of a brigade in early 1864, leading it until he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Cedar Creek. Early life Daniel Bidwell was born on August 12, 1819, in Buffalo, New York. He was raised in the city and educated in local schools. He was involved in, and became the leader of, \\"D\\" Company Buffalo City Guard (an independent militia), before the war. Civil War After the outbreak of war, Daniel Bidwell joined the 65th New York State Militia as a private but was promoted to the rank of captain. He then was involved in organizing the 74th New York Militia. Bidwell next was appointed colonel of the 49th New York Volunteer Infantry on August 1, 1861. As regimental commander, he served in the Peninsula Campaign in the Second Division, VI Corps, Army of the Potomac. Bidwell apparently was not present at the Battle of South Mountain or the Battle of Antietam. In 1863, when VI Corps, under Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick, crossed the Rappahannock River during the campaign culminating in the Battle of Chancellorsville, Bidwell‚Äôs regiment served in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas H. Neill in the Second Division, VI corps, now under Brig. Gen. Albion Howe. The 49th New York distinguished itself by fending off probing attacks launched by Confederate MG Jubal Early as Neill's brigade approached Fredericksburg, Virginia. Bidwell thereafter was involved in the Second Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of Salem Church. On the morning of May 4, 1863, Bidwell's regiment, with artillery support, fended off an attack by the 48th Virginia Infantry from the brigade of Brig. Gen. William \\"Extra Billy\\" Smith. The New Yorkers reported capturing 200 prisoners and the colors of that regiment.War of the Rebellion, vol. 25, part 1, pp. 609-611 no. 230, Report of Brig. Gen. Thomas H. Neill. The 49th New York suffered only 35 casualties in these actions.War of the Rebellion, vol. 25, pt. 1, p. 190. Bidwell continued in regimental command at the Battle of Gettysburg, where he served under General Neill on the far right flank of the Army. When the Army of the Potomac was reorganized for Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant‚Äôs Overland Campaign, Bidwell retained his command under General Neill, but they had a new division commander, Brig. Gen. George Getty. When Getty was wounded in the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5, 1864, Neill became acting division commander. Bidwell took over command of Neill‚Äôs brigade. The brigade had been detached from second division and sent to serve under Brig. Gen. Horatio Wright on the right flank of the Army. On May 6, Bidwell took part in an unsuccessful assault on the Confederate lines. Later in the day, when Confederate Brig. Gen. John B. Gordon attacked the exposed right flank of VI Corps, Bidwell's command was the third brigade from the right, with the commands of Brig. Gen. Truman Seymour and Brig. Gen. Alexander Shaler beyond it. Gordon's attack routed the brigades of Shaler and Seymour. Bidwell turned his brigade to face the Confederate advance and a portion of Seymour's brigade rallied on his line. This stand stopped Gordon's advance.Steere, pp. 130, 319, 442. Bidwell led his brigade at the Battle of Spotsylvania, the Battle of Cold Harbor, and the earliest stage of the Siege of Petersburg. Colonel Bidwell was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on August 11, 1864. Service in the Shenandoah Valley Bidwell was present at the earliest stages of the Siege of Petersburg. Thereafter, he served in Washington, D.C., and the Shenandoah Valley. When Jubal Early moved on the capital following his ousting Maj. Gen. David Hunter from the Valley, he crossed into Maryland. After winning the Battle of Monocacy, Early moved on Washington. He had been delayed just long enough for units of VI Corps to reach the capital. Bidwell‚Äôs brigade arrived just as the Confederates were advancing on Fort Stevens, one of the key forts on the perimeter of Washington. At a crucial stage of the Battle of Fort Stevens Bidwell's brigade moved out and pushed back Early‚Äôs troops. Bidwell‚Äôs command lost about one quarter of its numbers, about 250 of 1,000, in this action.Leepson, Marc, Desperate Engagement, pp. 195-197., New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 2007. , Bidwell next was in the field under the command of Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan. Maj. Gen. Horatio Wright commanded VI Corps in the new Army of the Shenandoah, and Getty had resumed command of second division. Bidwell led his brigade at the Battle of Opequon, otherwise known as the Third Battle of Winchester, and the Battle of Fisher's Hill.Bidwell's report on these battles appears in War of the Rebellion, series I, vol. 42, pt. 1, pp. 212-214 no. 42. At the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19, 1864, much of the Army of the Shenandoah was ousted from its encampments by a surprise Confederate attack. VI corps was the last infantry command left contesting the enemy advance by 7:00 AM. When first and third divisions were forced to retreat, Getty's second division became the rear guard of the Union infantry force. Bidwell's brigade held the left flank of Getty's division with the 1st Vermont Brigade in the center and Col J. M. Warner's brigade on the right. This line held despite continued Confederate attacks and then artillery fire. General Bidwell was mortally wounded by a Confederate shell while commanding his brigade.Lepa, pp. 194-196. Getty eventually had to withdraw to the line from which Sheridan, who had ridden in from Winchester, Virginia launched his successful counterattack. Lt. Col. Winsor B. French of the 77th New York Infantry commanded Bidwell's brigade after he was struck down.The brigade's report for Cedar Creek was filed by Col Thomas W. Hyde; see War of the Rebellion, series I, vol. 42, pt. 1, pp. 214-217 no. 43.

It features Rick Danko on lead vocals and was written by Robbie Robertson.

It was also performed at The Last Waltz. The studio version was released as a single in Denmark. The live version from Before the Flood was released as the B-side of Dylan's \\"Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)\\" single in 1974. According to AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann, the lyrics are about \\"the pitfalls of fortune and fame.\\" Author Neil Minturn regards the subject of the lyrics to be \\"the history of The Band itself.\\" The Band drummer Levon Helm has written that the song is about \\"the terror of performing.\\" Others believe that the lyrics refer to Bob Dylan, who had stopped touring live during the late 1960s. Author David Yaffe suggests that \\"Stage Fright\\" could have been written about Dylan or about Robbie Robertson himself. Author Barney Hoskyns acknowledges speculation that the song is about Dylan, but states that it is actually about Robertson's experience of his own stage fright at the Band's first live show the prior year. Time Magazine praised the song's image of a plowboy, who in the opening of the song received \\"his fortune and fame\\" but \\"since that day he ain't been the same.\\" The song begins in the key of C major and that key is also prominent at the end. The keys of E minor and G major are also emphasized throughout the song. Since these keys are related to C major, they help reinforce the prominence of C major in the song. G major is also emphasized through the use of these keys and the related key of B minor. Tense lyrics about paying a price to be able to \\"sing like a bird\\" and a surprising shift to the unrelated key of F sharp major increase the tension of the bridge, which leads into Garth Hudson's organ solo. Minturn praises Hudson's sixteen bar solo for using rhythm, pace, rest and pitch to \\"work together to hold back, to balance or to tip forward at just the right time.\\" Helm regarded the song as a \\"showpiece\\" for lead singer and bassist Rick Danko particularly in the use of a fretless bass, which according to Helm \\"gave the rhythm section a different feel.\\" Music critic Ralph J. Gleason considered \\"Stage Fright\\" to be \\"the best song ever written about performing.\\" Music critic Paul Evans praised the \\"penetrating psychological acuity\\" of its writing. Rolling Stone critic Dave Marsh called it one of the most notably fine moments of the Stage Fright album. Critic Mark Kemp called it a \\"highlight\\" of the album, further noting that it reveals \\"a growing sense of anxiety and cynicism\\" by the band.\\" Personnel *Robbie Robertson ‚Äì electric guitar *Garth Hudson ‚Äì Lowrey organ *Richard Manuel ‚Äì piano, backing vocals *Rick Danko ‚Äì bass, lead vocals *Levon Helm ‚Äì drums ReferencesExternal links * 1970 singles Stage Fright 1974 singles Asylum Records singles Capitol Records singles Songs written by Robbie Robertson Stage Fright ","title":"Stage Fright (The Band song)"},{"id":"18646507","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Khunti () is a diocese located in the city of Khunti in the Ecclesiastical province of Ranchi in India.

The first bishop nominated of the Anglican Diocese of Lebombo was William Edmund Smyth, in 1893, who would be in functions until 1912. Only after the beginning of the war of independence between Portugal and the FRELIMO, the diocese would have his first Portuguese language bishop, Daniel Pina Cabral, a white European born prelate. Pina Cabral developed friendly relationships with the Roman Catholic bishops of Mozambique and established contact with members of the FRELIMO. He would be in office from 1969 to 1976, shortly after the independence. He was succeeded by the first Mozambican-born black bishop, Dinis Sengulane, in office from 1976 to 2014.

It is a professional association that promotes the applied science and engineering technology professionals in industry, educational institutions, the public and the government. ASET evaluates the qualifications of individuals who voluntarily apply for certification and issues professional credentials accordingly. ASET acts as an advocate for the profession to governments and the general public. It also delivers a number of benefits and services to its members and their employers. History On August 1, 1963, with the sponsorship of the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta (APEGGA), the Alberta Society of Engineering Technicians was incorporated. In 1966, the name was adjusted to the Alberta Society of Engineering Technologists. Then, in 2005, the name was updated to properly reflect the broad range of disciplines in which ASET certifies, thus becoming the Association of Science and Engineering Technology Professionals of Alberta while the established acronym ASET was retained.\\"ASET - The First 25 Years (1963-1988)\\" Governance and Operation Although ASET interacts closely with the provincial and federal governments, it is not a governmental organization and receives no governmental funding. ASET's activities are primarily funded by annual membership dues. The association's affairs are governed by an elected council of technician and technologist members. Much of the association's operation is aided by volunteer members. A paid, administrative staff operates out of the ASET office in Edmonton, including the Executive Director who liaises with the council. Former national identity through CCTT Each of the 10 Canadian Provinces has a society similar in nature to ASET. In 1970, a coordinating body representing engineering and applied science technicians and technologists in Canada was formed, known as the Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists (CCTT). Provincial societies appoint directors to CCTT for its governance. ASET has withdrawn from CCTT as of summer 2010. Since then, it has joined an organization called Technology Professionals Canada, which is not a signatory of the Sydney or Dublin Accords. Certification ASET includes a panel of professional members that evaluates applications for certification and registers engineering and applied science technicians and technologists who meet established Canadian standards in education and experience. Designations ASET confers the following post- nominal designations: * C.Tech. (Certified Technician) * C.E.T. (Certified Engineering Technologist) * P.Tech. (Professional Technologist) - Members who earn this designation have the right to practice engineering independently in accordance with established methodologies and specifications including existing codes and regulations. With this right, a member is able to sign off and stamp their own work. Other types of ASET membership include: * Student - enrolled in the final half of a recognized Alberta technical institute or college training program that will lead to eventual professional certification in one of the applied science, information or engineering technologies. * T.T. (Technician/Technologist in Training) - open to any person who resides in the province of Alberta or the Canadian Territories and who graduated from a Canadian institute of technology or college whose course content is approved as being satisfactory for certification as a technician or technologist, but who has not completed the full two years' related work experience requirement. * R.E.T. (Registered Engineering Technologist) - a senior designation still recognized in Alberta, but no longer offered The above symbols are legally protected for use only by certified members. ASET has issued other designations in the past, which are no longer issued in Alberta: * A.Sc.T. (Applied Science Technologist) * C.C.I.T. (Certified Computer Information Technologist) ASET members who earned these designations previously were instead assigned C.E.T. The designations conferred by ASET are recognized across Canada by provincial member organizations of Technology Professionals of Canada (TPC) and CCTT.

Fr. Bernardo Toress in June 1947. The Holy Trinity Academy in Balic-Balic, Sampaloc, Manila is a parochial school founded in June 1947 by the late Rev. Fr. Bernardo Torres. The school started with a kinder class in 1948. By the beginning of the school year 1947-1948, Sisters Agnes Encarnacion and Sr. Pudenciana Martinez of the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception were assigned to the school through the invitation of Fr. Torres to teach in the primary and intermediate sections of the Academy until the end of school year 1948-1949. In 1955, Msgr. Francisco Avenda√±o succeeded Father Torres and later on Fr. Felix Ignacio took the helm. History The school was a former cemetery called 'Cemeteryo de Balic-Balic' and opened in 1890, built by Padre 'Ramon Caviedas'. And in 1955, The American Health Institution closed the cemetery. In 1958, the late Rufino Cardinal Santos turned over the management of the school to the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, the sister congregation of the Don Bosco Fathers. They set up the co-ed classes from kindergarten to grade four and exclusive section for girls for grades five and six. The male pupils after finishing grade four transferred to other schools of the parent's choice. In 1962, Rev. Msgr. Isidro L. Jose was installed parish priest. Fully aware of his role as spiritual leader of the community, he tried to accommodate all the children of school age and to mold them along the Christian way. Thus, in 1964, the Holy Trinity Boy's Department came into existence. It was in the same year that Msgr. Jose paid from the Parish funds and by installments Fr. Torres for the rights in the school. During its first year, the HTA Boy's Department started with one class of grade five only. In the second year, the administration offered classes from grade four to grade six. First year classes were begun in the third year of operation with one section for boys and one section for girls. Then in its fourth year, the Salesian Sisters requested Cardinal Santos to transfer the first two years of High School girls to the Girls' Department, and the remaining boys' sections from the Girls' Department transferred to the Boys' Department. The supervision of the Boy's Department was entrusted to lay principals while the girls remained under the Salesian Sisters. In 1972‚Äì1973 school year, the Boy's Department started a co-educational program in kinder classes. In the succeeding curriculum years, female enrollment in both grade school and high school departments increased. Thus, the boys' department dropped its name and became HTA Co-ed Department in 1974. Initial integration started in school year 1976‚Äì1977 by way of centralized school funds, one school calendar, class programs, DECS reports and standardized salary. The HTA girls and Co-ed Departments flourished under the directorship of Very Rev. Msgr. Isidro L. Jose. Subsequent school directors Msgr. Danilo Pascual (1983‚Äì1988) and Msgr. Cesar Pagulayan (1988‚Äì1991) worked to realize this integration. From 1991 to 1997, during the term of Msgr. Manuel Gabriel, the identity of Holy Trinity Academy as a parochial school was further clarified. By the end of the 1992‚Äì93 school year, the Salesian Sisters ceased management of the Holy Trinity Academy. The following school year, a new congregation, the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena, was assigned to the school but stayed for only a year. At the outset of the following school year, HTA became a fully co-ed school, pre-school to 4th year level under the supervision of lay administrators headed by the Priest Director. It was not until the 1996‚Äì1997 school year that religious sisters was re-established in the school with the coming of the Daughters of Mary of the Assumption (fma). In succeeding years, the Manila Archdiocesan Parochial School Association (MAPSA) has been gearing up to upgrade parochial schools of the Archdiocese of Manila in general operations, academic standards, faculty and employee development and administration. MAPSA has become an avenue for communion of parochial schools, direction setting and accentuating their Christian identity, role and mission. In the last quarter of 1997, Msgr. Sebastian assumed the position of Parish Priest and School Director but transferred after a couple of months. Rev. Fr. Enrico Martin F. Adoviso reported to the Parish and the Academy in January 1998. The organizational assessment conducted during the 1998‚Äì1999 school year indicated a need to reorganize school structures and policies. The Board of Trustees and the administration implemented measures to improve the system so that by the year 2000, the School stabilized. Employees‚Äô development was prioritized and the school facilities greatly improved. Simultaneous to these important developments, the Principalship of the Grade School and High School departments were assigned by the Archdiocese of Manila to Sr. Jesiela Deguilmo and Sr. Laureana Polinar, both from the congregation of the Daughters of Mary of the Assumption. By the end of the school year 2000‚Äì2001, offices and faculty rooms were air conditioned and renovated; the whole school building was repainted inside out and all classrooms were air-conditioned; the HS canteen became fully furnished and science laboratories were constructed and fully equipped. An Php 8.8 M gymnasium was erected and a sports program for students was established and series of personnel development seminars ensued. At the dawn of the 2001‚Äì2002 school year, the administration expressed its direction and priorities, namely: * employees and faculty holistic development * upliftment of academic standard emphasizing relevance of the academic formation to societal issues and concerns * purchase, construction and upgrading of academic facilities, specifically laying the grounds for Information and Communication Technology to enhance teaching-learning experience; * further strengthening and professionalization of structures and policies * integration of the school and parish communities To realize the above, the Academy created and implemented a five-year development plan, which started with an assessment and evaluation of all aspects of the School administration and operation propelled by series of seminars for the revision of School Vision-Mission-Goals. In the seventh year of Fr. Adoviso's Directorship of the Academy, on January 5, 2005, HTA geared up to vie for the accreditation of Philippine Association of Accrediting Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) while continuously focusing on the Vision and Mission of the school true to its being Home of Tomorrow's Achievers.

Biography Portrait of the Duke of √Åvila and Bolama; Miguel √Çngelo Lupi, 1870. Ant√≥nio Jos√© was the son of Manuel Jos√© de √Åvila, a modest merchant and administrator of the local tithes and his wife, D. Prudenciana Joaquina C√¢ndida da Costa, who lived in a humble home on Rua de Santo Elias. Of their ten children, only four survived to adulthood: Ant√≥nio Jos√© was the oldest, his sister Joaquina Emerenciana (born in 1804), Maria do Carmo (born in 1815) and Manuel Jos√© (born in 1817). During Ant√≥nio Jos√©'s infancy, the family's economic conditions improved substantially, enough that his father could provide him with sufficient funds to permit him to study off-island: a privilege that only a few families could provide their children. Career After completing his local studies, he traveled to Coimbra to study at the University in 1822, receiving a bachelors degree in Philosophy in 1826. While at Coimbra he also frequented some courses in Mathematics and entered the first year studies in Medicine, but he did not show any particular interest in politics. During the Liberal Wars (1832‚Äì34) he returned to Horta (the liberal government-in-exile escaped to the Azores during this period), where he taught for several years before becoming a politician of some success. As mayor through D. Pedro's liberal regency, Ant√≥nio Jos√© was instrumental in obtaining a new charter, that elevated Horta to the status of city (4 July 1833). Politician After the War (1834), √Åvila was elected to the Cortes, beginning an active and uninterrupted career that would last for the next 47 years, in different positions, in parliamentary and governmental roles, as well as a period in the Chamber of Peers (taking on the leadership of the group from the Duke of Loul√©, from 1872 until May 1881). He was, as his biographer once wrote: \\"...one of the more distinct parliamentarians in the history of Portuguese constitutionalism...\\".Ribeiro, 2007, p.69 In actuality, in the 11 legislatures that he participated, during 27 years (between 1834‚Äì1861) he participated in 30 commissions in the Chamber of Deputies,Sardica, 2004, p.236 and 40 in the Chamber of Peers (between 1861‚Äì1881); he was involved in 2000 interventions. He did not limit himself to representing the citizens of Horta; during his many years in parliament he represented populations in √âvora, Beja, Estremadura, Beira Alta, Chaves, Vila Real and Oliveira de Azem√©is. An excellent orator, untiring worker and astute politician, he was regularly called on to handle governmental functions. Ideologically, √Åvila was a conservative within the liberalist ranks, usually referred to as Cartismo, and was in opposition to the progressive wave that appeared as a result of the Septemberist Revolution (September 1836). As the Septemberist movement declined (with the election of the Cartista Joaquim Ant√≥nio de Aguiar, in 1841), he was appointed Ministro da Fazenda (English: Minister of Commerce) in the cabinet of Joaquim Ant√≥nio de Aguiar, at the age of 34, maintaining the post in the governments of Costa Cabral and the Duque da Terceira. In 1857, he resumed the Minister of Commerce post, under the primer-ship of the Duque de Loul√©, after the fall of the Saldanha government. He also took on diplomatic responsibilities and administrative posts (such as the Companhia das Lez√≠ras, Campanhia do Cr√©dito Predial, Banco Hipotec√°rio and Banco do Portugal). In 1861, he was appointed as Portugal's representative to the Madrid conference, which aimed to resolve the issue of the island of Bolama. The British occupied the West African island off the coast of modern-day Guinea Bissau, but the ownership of the island was disputed by the Portuguese. The final settlement recognized Portuguese sovereignty on the island. During various governments he exercised roles as: Ministro da Fazenda (English: Minister of Commerce), Ministro da Justi√ßa (English: Minister of Justice), Ministro dos Neg√≥cios Estrangeiros (English: Minister of Foreign Affairs), Ministro do Reino (English: Minister of the Crown/Kingdom), and Ministro das Obras P√∫blicas (English: Minister of Public Works). In 10 different governments, between 1841 and 1870, he managed 19 different portfolios, and in 1868, 1870 and 1877 he was Prime Minister of Portugal. In his first term (beginning on 4 January 1868) as Prime Minister, he revoked the unpopular tax imposed by the coalition government of Joaquim Ant√≥nio de Aguiar, which aggravated the financial difficulties of the State (which would lead to the fall of the government by 22 July). He returned to the Finance portfolio, then Prime Minister, between 29 October 1870 and 13 September 1871, when he substituted Fontes Pereira de Melo. In 1877, owing to public discontent, the Fontes government fell. √Åvila was once again invited to form a government, which lasted 10 months until Fontes returned to power. Later life Burial crypt of √Åvila family, Prazeres Cemetery, Lisbon During his long career, he never forgot in his friends and colleagues in Horta and was regularly consulted by administrative and social organizations. As J.M. Sardica later noted: :\\"the pleb that one day became duke...coming so far, without even a nickname, fortune or special royal favors, rose and became a unique person in the Portuguese constitutional monarchy...through his hands passed a better part of the history of Portugal in the 19th century.\\"Sardica, 2001, p.684 On 13 February 1864, King Luis I of Portugal granted him the title of Conde de √Åvila (Count of √Åvila) which, six years later, on 24 May 1870, was raised to Marqu√™s de √Åvila e Bolama (Marquis of √Åvila and Bolama). After another eight years, on 14 May 1878, King Luis raised him still higher to Duque de √Åvila e Bolama (Duke of √Åvila and Bolama), thus making him the first non-noble-born individual so honored, especially in view of the fact that the title of Duke was, traditionally, granted in Portugal solely to members of high nobility and relatives of the Portuguese Royal Family. Ant√≥nio Jos√© de √Åvila died in Lisbon eight weeks after his 74th birthday. The Duke's state funeral, which occurred on 5 May 1881, left the Church of the Martyrs around 2:00, and its cortege arrived at the Prazeres Cemertary around 4:00 in the afternoon.Ribeiro, 2007, p.115 Its palm bearers included Fontes e Sampaio, the Duke of Palmela, the Marquis of Ficalho and the Duke of Loul√©, who proceeded a group of 500‚Äì600 carriages, with more than a thousand people that included representatives of the Royal Family, State bodies, associations and many classes of the society.Ribeiro, 2007, p.115 A coach of the Royal House was provided to transport the body, followed by a carriage with the parish vicar of Martyrs Church and twelve priests.Ribeiro, 2007, p.115 This carriage was also followed by the Ant√≥nio Jos√© de √Åvila's nephew, and another carriage with Ducal crown on a black velvet pillow, followed by the 4th Regimental Cavalry and band. At the cemetery the Duke's body was transported down by Hintze Ribeiro, Jo√£o Gualberto de Barros e Cunha, Carlos Bento da Silva, Dias de Oliveira, Reis e Vasconcelos, Carlos Zeferino Pinto Coelho and the Count d'Alte.Ribeiro, 2007, p.115 The cortege passed along the packed streets with many of the residents watching from their windows. The Duke had already planned his entombment: \\"...a small chapel of marble, of a simple architecture, with a small cross..in high relief the coat- of-arms of d'√Åvila and Bolama with the Marqueses crown, with the titles 'Family of the Marquis d'√Åvila and Bolama'\\".O Fayalense, 1881, p.2 See also *List of Prime Ministers of Portugal *List of dukedoms of Portugal *Dukes of √Åvila and Bolama *Marquis of √Åvila and Bolama *Count of √Åvila References ;Notes ;Sources  External links * Genealogy of the 1st Duke of √Åvila and Bolama (in Portuguese) 1806 births 1881 deaths Prime Ministers of Portugal Finance ministers of Portugal 101 Portuguese diplomats Avila Avila Antonio Jose 1 Mayors of places in Portugal University of Coimbra alumni 19th-century Portuguese people Portuguese nobility ","title":"Ant√≥nio Jos√© de √Åvila, 1st Duke of √Åvila and Bolama"},{"id":"18646794","text":"The Diocese of Lesotho is a diocese in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa.

The Institute was founded in 1947 by entrepreneur J.I. Rodale in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. When J.I. Rodale died in 1971, his son Robert purchased 333 acres and moved the farm to its current site in Kutztown, Pennsylvania. Rodale Institute uses a long-term, side-by-side research trial model to compare organic and conventional agriculture. Its longest running experiment, the Farming Systems Trial, has been running since 1981 and compares organic and conventional corn, soybeans, and other grains. The Institute also researches the effects of growing food without chemical pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers on human health, water quality, climate change, and more. Collaborations with farmers and agricultural science peers throughout Pennsylvania and Maryland, as well as nationally and internationally, enable Institute researchers to replicate experiments across different geographical regions and benefit farmers with opportunities to test new approaches to organic production. In addition, the institute allies with national and state-level organic certification programs, industry leaders and elected officials to help shape policy. Furthermore, the institute partners strategically with U.S. and foreign government entities, businesses and organizations to promote regenerative organic farming opportunities and to expand the benefits of organic agriculture to more people. History Starting in 1942, Rodale began publishing his views and practical advice in his startup magazine, Organic Farming and Gardening. In the magazine, he avidly promoted a holistic, whole-systems approach to agriculture. J.I. Rodale died in 1971 at the age of 72. His son Robert (Bob) Rodale expanded his father's agriculture- and health-related pursuits with the purchase of a farm east of Kutztown, Pennsylvania. At the Kutztown site, Bob and Ardath, his wife, established what is now known as the Rodale Institute to begin an era of regenerative, organic farm-scale research. The Kutztown site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also known as the Siegfried's Dale Farm. Rodale proposed the concept of regeneration to argue that any natural system, properly managed, could be productive while increasing its capacity into the future. He wrote that regenerative organic farming can use its own internal resources to improve soil fertility and productivity over time, rather than relying on expensive‚Äîand potentially environmentally damaging‚Äîoutside chemical inputs. Bob Rodale died in a 1990 automobile accident in Moscow while launching a Russian edition of Rodale's New Farm magazine. John Haberern, who had been hired by Robert Rodale as a Rodale Press book editor in 1961, took over as president of the Institute. Ardath Rodale became the institute's chairman. Anthony Rodale, son of Ardath and Bob, became vice-chairman. Anthony and his wife, Florence, developed outreach efforts for children during the couple's period of active program involvement before Anthony became an international ambassador for the Institute. Board member Paul McGinley, Esq., became co-chair of the board with Ardath in 2005. Testimony by Bob Rodale, John Haberern and farmers and agricultural scientists convinced the U.S. Congress to include funds for sustainable agriculture (first called \\"Low-Input Sustainable Agriculture)\\" in the 1985 Farm Bill. This validation of an agroecological approach to farming led to the formation of the USDA's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) program in 1990. Today, federal, state and local governments, as well as land-grant universities and other organizations nationwide are pursuing sustainable and organic agriculture research and education programs. Today, J.I. Rodale's great-granddaughter, Maya Rodale, serves as co-chairman of the Board of Directors along with Whole Foods General Counsel Roberta Lang. Current programs and experiments A test garden at the Rodale Institute The Rodale Institute conducts research that seeks to improve the viability, productivity and documented ecological services of organic farming using current agricultural technologies and practices. Focusing on agronomic (and some horticultural) cropping systems, research trials examine organic and conventional practices, chemical-free weed-management techniques, weed- and disease-resistant crop varieties, compost management and application, soil health, no-till organic planting systems using cover crops and optimal cover- crop uses in organic crop rotations. An important part of the Rodale Institute's research has been the ongoing Farming Systems Trial (FST). Begun in 1981, the FST compares two organic farming systems‚Äîmanure-based and legume- based approaches‚Äîto conventional farming methods, defined as methods using Cooperative Extension-prescribed chemical and tillage inputs. Cows, a source animal agriculture and manure, at the Rodale Institute FST found that after fields undergo a multi-year transition period to restore biological activity, organic yields are comparable to those of conventional systems. Additionally, organic yields exceed those of conventional systems in years of drought and other stress.Peterson, C., Drinkwater L., and P. Wagoner. 1999.

She represented Australia at twelve Paralympics from 1972 to 2016, and won thirteen medals, nine of them gold. Personal Kosmala interviewed by the 300x300px Kosmala was born on 8 July 1942 in Adelaide. Her father was a lawyer. She was born with club feet, which were straightened out with plasters and bandages. She was initially classified as having spina bifida, but at the age of 50, she discovered that her paraplegia was due to birth-related complications; she was delivered in a long operation using forceps by a cardiologist. She is paralysed from the waist down, and her spine is of normal thickness down to the middle of her back, thins out to the size of a pencil, then comes out normally again. She learnt to stand at the age of seven, and her parents made her walk from 20 to 30 minutes a day from then until she was seventeen years old. She learnt to walk in full-length callipers, surgical boots, and with two walking sticks. She attended Loreto Convent School, where she was not allowed to do physical activities. She trained to be a secretary at the rehabilitation unit of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, and received her first job as a secretary at the Adelaide Botanic Garden at the age of 20. She was there for eleven years, then transferred to the heart and lung investigative unit of the Royal Adelaide Hospital. She then worked part-time after having children. She also worked as a public relations officer for the spina bifida association for twelve years before retiring. She met her husband, Stan Kosmala, in the 1970s through wheelchair sport. He won a gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Paralympics in lawn bowls. They have two sons and two grandchildren. 300x300px She played a part in the introduction of disabled parking permits in South Australia, after accumulating and refusing to pay many parking fines for parking too long in a fifteen-minute parking area. She won a court case against the City of Adelaide on the issue, but was asked to pay her court costs, which were covered by an anonymous donor. In 2013, Kosmala became the inaugural patron of Technical Aid to the Disabled South Australia (TADSA), a charity that aims to help people with disabilities overcome problems by designing and building or modifying devices where no other solution is readily available. Kosmala's first contact with TADSA was as a client in the late 1970s. In rifle shooting, competitors ordinarily lie flat to shoot. As she is in a wheelchair this was not possible, so she needed something to rest upon, and also have a place for her ammunition. TADSA built a table for Kosmala to alleviate this problem. As she had to take it with her for international competitions, it had to be a light weight folding table (Kosmala would pack it in her suitcase). She said \\"It's probably fair to say that this table (which has been to 10 Paralympic Games) has helped me win my gold medals.\\" Competitive career Kosmala at the 469x469px 300x300px Kosmala was introduced to wheelchair sport by a patient at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, a few months before starting work at the Adelaide Botanic Garden. She first competed nationally at the 1966 National Wheelchair Games in Brisbane. She competed in foil fencing, swimming, wheelchair racing, field events, and archery. In a 2011 interview, she said that the organiser who picked the team for the 1968 Tel Aviv Paralympics forgot to include her, so she worked as a secretary at the games instead. She won two gold medals in archery and foil fencing, a silver medal in the pentathlon, and four bronze medals in swimming and wheelchair racing events at the 1970 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Edinburgh, in her first international event. She initially had to raise all her own money for the games, but after a radio interview and a newspaper article about her plight, John Eustice Motors gave her a cheque with all the money required for the games. At the 1972 Heidelberg Paralympics, she won a bronze medal in swimming in the Women's 3x50 m Medley Relay 2‚Äì4 event, and participated in other swimming and athletics events. She was introduced to rifle shooting in the early 1970s, and consistently hit the target on her first try at the sport. At the 1976 Toronto Games, she won a gold medal in the Mixed Rifle Shooting 2‚Äì5 event, and participated in archery and dartchery events. At the 1980 Arnhem Games, she won a gold medal in the Mixed Air Rifle Prone 2‚Äì5 event, and two silver medals in the Mixed Air Rifle 3 Positions 2‚Äì5 and Mixed Air Rifle Kneeling 2‚Äì5 events., retrieved 18 April 2012. At the 1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville Games, she won four gold medals and broke four world records in the Women's Air Rifle 3 Positions 2‚Äì6, Women's Air Rifle Kneeling 2‚Äì6, Women's Air Rifle Prone 2‚Äì6, and Women's Air Rifle Standing 2‚Äì6 events. At the 1988 Seoul Games, she won three gold medals in the Women's Air Rifle 3 Positions 2‚Äì6, Women's Air Rifle Kneeling 2‚Äì6, and Women's Air Rifle Prone 2‚Äì6 events, and a silver medal in the Women's Air Rifle Standing 2‚Äì6 event. She participated in every Paralympics from then until the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games without winning medals, though her scores gradually improved over time. She was the Australian flag bearer for the opening ceremony at the 1996 Atlanta Games. At the 2000 Sydney Games, she competed against her husband in the preliminary round of the Mixed Air Rifle Prone SH1- event, and came eighth just in front of him. She achieved her best ever result in the Women's Air Rifle Standing SH1- event at the 2008 Beijing Games, where she narrowly missed out on a medal. She was Australia's oldest representative at the Beijing Games and the oldest Paralympian overall at the 2012 London Games, where she announced her retirement. However, she came back to compete, after being selected in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. At the 2016 Paralympics she was once again the oldest competitor, finishing her Paralympic career placing 18th in the Women's R2 ‚Äì 10 m Air Rifle Standing ‚Äì SH1 qualification and 37th in the Mixed R3 ‚Äì 10 m Air Rifle Prone ‚Äì SH1 qualification. She announced her retirement from all competitive shooting in August 2020. She was coached by Yvonne Hill throughout her shooting career, and also works with National Rifle Shooting Coach Miro Sepic. She received scholarships from the South Australian Institute of Sport every year of her career beginning in 1985. In 1994, she was initially barred from participating in an air rifle shooting state championship, despite being the club champion, because she was in a wheelchair. She eventually won the competition but the trophy was awarded to the person who came second rather than her. The case was eventually reconciled in court. In 2003, she had both her everyday and sporting wheelchairs stolen while on an Emirates flight from Dubai to Germany to compete in the national games. She used borrowed wheelchairs while in Germany, and when she arrived home with no wheelchair to return to, she said that it was the first time in her life that she really felt \\"disabled\\". The airline company gave her 2,000 dollars towards the cost of replacement wheelchairs, which were worth 5,000 dollars each. Recognition In 1985, Kosmala received a Medal of the Order of Australia \\"for service to the sport of air rifle shooting\\". She received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and a Centenary Medal in 2001. In 2016, she received the Tanya Denver Award at the Advertiser/Channel 7 Sport Star of the Year awards. In 2019, Kosmala was inducted into the South Australian Sport Hall of Fame.

History Babble was established in 1992 when Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie decided to drop the Thompson Twins and form a new group that would allow them to explore new musical ideas. They approached their long-time engineer Keith Fernley, who also became a full member of the new group. The trio spent five weeks in India during 1992 to collect sound and sample recordings for future recording use. The band's first recording, a non-album track \\"Chale Jao\\", appeared on the soundtrack of the film Coneheads in 1993. That same year saw the release of a promotional single, \\"Tribe\\", in America only. The song was also featured as part of the soundtrack of the 1994 comedy-drama film With Honors. In March 1994, the group released their debut album, The Stone, which had been recorded in London.

Babble began recording demos for a third album, however Warner Brothers decided to end their contract with the band. After Babble's split, both Bailey and Currie continued to live in New Zealand, where Currie effectively retired from music.

The Cortoon man who excelled in the No.6 jersey of Galway throughout the 1970s. Early life Born and bred in the village of Cortoon just outside Tuam, Gilmore spent almost twenty years from 1968 onwards in the Senior ranks of local Cortoon Shamrocks and helped the small rural club to county semi final appearances in 1975 and 1978. Centre Half-back is the position he will always be remembered for, but he played in a variety of locations from full back to full forward. Actually pulling on the No. 14 jersey to help his county to victory over Roscommon in the 1981 National League decider. A county Minor in 1967 and on Under 21 for two further years, it was quite a magnificent achievement for the Cortoon man to break into the county‚Äôs star studded Senior team at that time. Biography Any player who has suffered it will tell how bitterly disappointing it is to leave Croke Park empty-handed on All-Ireland final day. Gilmore was subjected to the painful ordeal on three occasions and, not surprisingly, would love the opportunity of venturing into the vaults of time and re-writing the record books. Failure to get his hands on an All-Ireland souvenir was a bitter pill to swallow and by far the biggest regret of his career. \\"It was a big disappointment for me because it‚Äôs every player‚Äôs ambition to get one. That would have been a great highlight for me\\". The Cortoon Shamrocks star was resident centre half back on the Galway sides which lost to Offaly, Cork and Dublin in 1971 / ‚Äô73 and ‚Äô74 respectively. In hindsight, he feels that had the Tribesmen a trusty place-kicker on board then things might have been different. It‚Äôs a big disappointment to appear in three finals in four years and not win one. To get so close makes it harder to accept, but I firmly believe that the lack of a reliable free-taker cost us two finals. The ‚Äô71 result was upsetting because if we had put the ball over the bar from placed balls like Tony McTeague did for Offaly on the day then we‚Äôd have won out comfortably. A team must carry a free-taker who can get four out of five over the bar from within fifty yards. A harsh lesson it was for the footballing Tribesmen who certainly paid the price for missed opportunities. Despite the obvious disappointments, Gilmore‚Äôs career furnished him with many golden memories, memories to be treasured forever. The Galway centre half was honoured with All-Star awards in 1972 and ‚Äô73 appearing on All-Star teams in the esteemed company of the likes of Se√°n O'Neill, Kevin Kilmurray, Brain McEniff, Mick O'Connell and Jimmy Barry Murphy to name but a few. \\"Centre back was certainly the position I had the greatest love for and to win two All-Stars there gave me great personal satisfaction. Such awards are nice bonuses as was the National league medal, but everything is only secondary to All-Ireland Championships\\" he notes ruefully. Gilmore also appeared in four Railway Cup finals, losing all four, and could have been forgiven at times for questioning the gods and wondering whether he was jinxed. \\"Naturally that thought does cross your mind at times\\", he admits. One will always remember the great Micheal O'Hehir referring to the Galway centre half back in the high scoring All-Ireland of 1973 versus Cork. Micheal‚Äôs words went like this: \\"Tommy Joe Gilmore has it on his own half back line, he goes past Dinny Long, 60 yards out from the Cork goals, fifty yards out, 40, 30, on the 21 yard line and it‚Äôs over the bar\\". As the most memorable game he ever played in Gilmore picks out the 3-11 to 2-7 victory over Down in the 1971 All- Ireland semi final. \\"That was a great Down team and a day which stood out for me. From a personal point of view I was pleased with my performance in the final but you have to look at the ones you win\\", states Gilmore who rates tigerish Kevin Kilmurray and selfless forager Tony Hanahoe as two of the best he ever came up against. Arriving on the intercounty scene just after the three-in-a-row had been completed, the Cortoon man could probably have timed things a little bit better. \\"When I arrived on the county team the likes of Seamus Leydon, Jim Duggan and Liam Sammon were still there and it was a time during which Galway football was very strong. We were expecting to win more All-Irelands but unfortunately missed out\\". Living in Galway city at present, Gilmore has little active involvement with the national code but had a stint helping out Willie Joyce, Jimmy Duggan, Tomas Heavy and Peter Lee as a selector on the county team between 1986 and ‚Äô88.

(From the Latin hypaethrus, from Ancient Greek ·ΩïœÄŒ±ŒπŒ∏œÅŒøœÇ hupaithros ·ΩëœÄœå hupo- \\"under\\" and Œ±·º∞Œ∏ŒÆœÅ aither \\"sky, air\\".) It was described by the Roman architect Vitruvius in his treatise De architectura, written for the emperor Caesar Augustus probably about 15 BC. Overview Hypaethral is in contradistinction to cleithral, a term applied to a covered temple.Hypaethral and Roofless Structures . DrBillong.com. Accessed June 10, 2012. The hypaethros or hypaethral opening is the term Vitruvius (iii. 2) used for the opening in the middle of the roof of temples, an example being found in Athens in the temple of Jupiter Olympius, which is octastyle. There was no example in Rome. However, at the time Vitruvius wrote (c. 25 AD) the cella of this temple was unroofed, because the columns which had been provided to carry, at all events, part of the ceiling and roof had been taken away by Sulla in 80 BC. The decastyle temple of Apollo Didymaeus near Miletus was, according to Strabo (c. 50 BC), unroofed, on account of the vastness of its cella, in which precious groves of laurel bushes were planted. The Temple of Aphaea on the Greek island of Aegina Apart from these two examples, the references in various writers to an opening of some kind in the roofs of temples dedicated to particular deities, and the statement of Vitruvius, which was doubtless based on the writings of Greek authors, that in decastyle or large temples the centre was open to the sky and without a roof (medium autem sub diva est sine tecto), render the existence of the hypaethros probable in some cases; and therefore C. R. Cockerell's discovery in the temple at Aegina of two fragments of a coping-stone, in which there were sinkings on one side to receive the tiles and covering tiles, has been of great importance in the discussion of this subject. In the conjectural restoration of the opaion or opening in the roof shown in Cockerell's drawing, it has been made needlessly large, having an area of about one quarter of the superficial area of the cella between the columns, and since in the Pantheon at Rome the relative proportions of the central opening in the dome and the area of the rotunda are 1:22, and the light there is ample, in the clearer atmosphere of Greece it might have been less. The larger the opening, the more conspicuous would be the notch in the roof which is so greatly objected to; in this respect, Jacques Hittorf would seem to be nearer the truth when, in his conjectural restoration of Temple R at Selinus, he shows an opaion about half the relative size shown in Cockerell's of that at Aegina, the coping on the side elevation being much less noticeable. Temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassae (Greece) The problem was apparently solved in another way at Bassae, where, in the excavations of the temple of Apollo by Cockerell and Baron Hailer von Hallerstein, three marble tiles were found with pierced openings in them about 18 inches by 10 in.; five of these pierced tiles on either side would have amply lighted the interior of the cella, and the amount of rain passing through (a serious element to be considered in a country where torrential rains occasionally fall) would not be very great or more than could be retained to dry up in the ceila sunk pavement. In favor of both these methods of lighting, the interior of the cella, the sarcophagus tomb at Cyrene, about long, carved in imitation of a temple, has been adduced, because, on the tor of the roof and in its centre, there is a raised coping, and a similar feature is found on a tomb found near Delos; an example from Crete now in the British Museum shows a pierced tile on each side of the roof, and a large number of pierced tiles have been found in Pompeii, some of them surrounded with a rim identical with that of the marble tiles at Bassae. On the other hand, there are many authorities, among them Wilhelm D√∂rpfeld, who have adhered to their original opinion that it was only through the open doorway that light was ever admitted into the celia, and with the clear atmosphere of Greece and the reflections from the marble pavement, such lighting would be quite sufficient. There remains still another source of light to be considered, that passing through the Parian marble tiles of the roof; the superior translucency of Parian to any other marble may have suggested its employment for the roofs of temples, and if, in the framed ceilings carried over the celia, openings were left, some light from the Parian tile roof might have been obtained. It is possibly to this that Plutarch refers when describing the ceiling and roof of the temple of Demeter at Eleusis, where the columns in the interior of the temple carried a ceiling, probably constructed of timbers crossing one another at right angles, and one or more of the spaces was left open, which Xenocles surmounted by a roof formed of tiles. James Fergusson In his 1849 Historical Inquiry into the True Principles of Beauty in Art: More Especially with Reference to Architecture James Fergusson put forward a conjectural restoration in which he adopted a clerestory above the superimposed columns inside the cella; in order to provide the light for these windows, he indicated two trenches in the roof, one on each side, and pointed out that the great Hall of Columns at Karnak was lighted in this way with clerestory windows; but in the first place the light in the latter was obtained over the flat roofs covering lower portions of the hail, and in the second place, as it rarely rains in Egyptian Thebes, there could be no difficulty about the drainage, while in Greece, with the torrential rains and snow, these trenches would be deluged with water, and with all the appliances of the present day it would be impossible to keep these clerestory windows watertight. There is, however, still another objection to Fergusson's theory: the water collecting in these trenches on the roof would have to be discharged, for which Fergusson's suggestions are quite inadequate, and the gargoyles shown in the celia wall would make the peristyle insupportable just at the time when it was required for shelter. No drainage otherwise of any kind has ever been found in any Greek temple, which is fatal to Fergusson's view. Nor is it in accordance with the definition open to the sky. English cathedrals and churches are all lighted by clemstory windows, but no one has described them as open to the sky, and although Vitruvius's statements are sometimes confusing, his description is far too clear to leave any misunderstanding as to the lighting of temples (where it was necessary on account of great length) through an opening in the roof. There is one other theory which has been put forward, but which can only apply to non-peristylar temples, that light and air were admitted through the metopes, the apertures between the beams crossing the cella, and it has been assumed that because Orestes was advised in one of the Greek plays to climb up and look through the metopes of the temple, these were left open; but if Orestes could look in, so could the birds, and the statue of the god would be defiled. The metopes were probably filled in with shutters of some kind, which Orestes knew how to open.

It was written by series creator/executive producer Tim Kring and directed by executive producer Allan Arkush. It first aired on September 22, 2008 as the beginning of the \\"Villains\\" storyline. Plot The episode begins four years into the future. Peter, who has a scar on his face, is being chased and enters a hangar. Claire tries to shoot him, but Peter stops time and time travels to the present day, taking Claire's gun with him. At Nathan's press conference, Future Peter shoots Nathan, as seen in \\"Powerless\\". Nathan is rushed to the hospital, where he dies. A short time later, Nathan awakens, prompting him to believe that God gave him a second chance at life. Nathan is later visited by Mr. Linderman, leading him to believe Linderman was the reason he was healed. The governor of New York watches Nathan on the television, and breaks the news to the woman he slept with: Tracy, a woman who looks identical to Niki. He tells her he thinks he has found what he is looking for. Matt later catches Future Peter trying to find the gun he had hid earlier, prompting Future Peter to teleport him to the desert because he knows too much. When Angela Petrelli arrives at the hospital, she tells Future Peter she knows he is impersonating his past self, and tells Future Peter that he actually got the ability to dream the future from her. Future Peter tells Angela that he put his present day self somewhere safe. At the Company headquarters, in one of the Level 5 prison cells, a bald man screams that he is Peter Petrelli. Noah Bennet is also locked up in an adjacent cell. Sylar arrives at Claire's home, leading Claire to try and escape. Sylar, however, manages to pin her down and steal Noah's files of people with abilities. Sylar cuts open Claire's forehead, but due to Claire's power, she does not die. She remains conscious as Sylar lays her on a table and examines her now-exposed brain, claiming he is looking for answers. Due to the lack of nerve endings in the human brain, she does not feel any pain. Sylar obtains Claire's power and Noah's files, puts Claire's scalp back on her head and turns to leave. Claire's scalp heals, and she then asks Sylar why she is still alive. He tells her she is unique and can't die, and from now on, neither can he. Sylar leaves, and Sandra and Lyle return home to find Claire crying, still with dried blood on her forehead. In his office at Yamagoto Industries in Japan, Hiro Nakamura tells Ando that he is bored without a quest. A video message from Kaito Nakamura is delivered to his office, which tells Hiro to never open Kaito's safe, which holds a secret. Hiro immediately opens the safe, and finds another video, with Kaito repeating that he was not supposed to open the safe. Hiro finds one half of a molecular formula, which gets stolen by a blur before he can comprehend what it means. Hiro stops time to see that the blur is a trail left by a woman with superspeed. She moves at normal speed while time is stopped, and comments that Hiro did not stop time completely. She hits him in the face and leaves with the formula as time resumes. Hiro jumps to the future to see how the world is destroyed. He sees Japan in a panic, and himself talking to Ando, arguing about the formula. Future Hiro yells at Ando saying that Ando betrayed him. Future Hiro is ready to strike with his sword, when Ando shoots what appears to be red electricity at Hiro, apparently killing him. Ando takes the formula from Hiro's body and walks away. The sky opens up and the world starts exploding, and Hiro jumps back to the present. Maya and Mohinder Suresh are at his apartment and he realizes that powers are controlled by the adrenal glands. Mohinder thinks he has isolated something that controls powers, and could give powers to anybody. Maya says the powers are a curse, and asks him to destroy the formula. On the docks, Mohinder considers throwing away the syringe with the formula. Instead, he injects himself, and collapses. Two muggers attempt to accost Mohinder as he lays semiconscious on the ground. However, he exhibits superhuman strength, repelling them. In the background, there is a giant painting of the Earth exploding from the inside. In the closing scenes of the episode, Mohinder narrates the William Butler Yeats poem \\"The Second Coming\\", the title's namesake. Matt wakes up in the desert, with no one in sight. As he walks across the desert, he stops in front of a rock where the picture of the earth exploding is painted, identical to the one behind Mohinder. Production \\"Villains\\" was originally designed to be included within the second season; however, due to the writers' strike, the volume was carried over into season three. The lead-in to \\"Villains\\" showed Sylar regaining his lost powers, shown as the final scene of the \\"Generations\\" finale. Tim Kring has said that the new volume will bring a cadre of villains to the show, hence the title. On December 5, 2007, at the Jules Verne Film Festival Adventure, Tim Kring showed a video-preview of volume three. According to an interview with Allan Arkush, filming for season three began on May 1, 2008. On May 9, 2008, a season three promo clip was released with hints at possible \\"inner villains\\" within the heroes. The promo stated, \\"In every hero there could be a villain,\\" before plastering the words \\"hero\\" and \\"villain\\" over the face of every major character. Finally, during the featured Heroes panel at the San Diego Comic-Con, the entire first hour of the first episode of the \\"Villains\\" arc was shown. In July NBC began airing a teaser for season three featuring Noah Bennet talking to Claire stating, \\"Since before you were even born, I was finding these people and locking them away so that they couldn't hurt anybody. Now a dozen of them have escaped, and they will kill...and they will terrorize...and they will conspire...and they will cause...unimaginable destruction to the world...they're villains, Claire,\\" while a montage of clips play. Zachary Quinto, who plays Sylar, has stated that the Villains story arc will last for thirteen episodes. Critical reception At the San Diego Comic-Con 2008, Kring screened the first part of \\"The Second Coming\\", which received a positive response from fans. Robert Canning of IGN felt that \\"The Second Coming\\" was \\"like a wasted opportunity\\". He saw the most noticeable difference between this episode and the last season as \\"the quick pacing\\", and found the revelation of Nathan's would-be assassin to be \\"the best part of the episode\\". He hoped that the Petrellis would continue to get focus, and questioned the choices made by Hiro and Mohinder, saying that their actions did not seem to reflect anything they would have learned from their past experiences. Canning said that although \\"The Second Coming\\" was \\"not exactly the second coming[,] it may well turn out to be a solid start to a season of redemption\\". Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club rated this episode, together with the next episode, a B+. ReferencesExternal links Beaming Beeman - Season 3, Episode 1 - Director's blog on the filming of this episode.

The term ‚Äòprotective autoimmunity‚Äô was coined by Prof. Michal Schwartz of the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel), whose pioneering studies were the first to demonstrate that autoimmune T lymphocytes can have a beneficial role in repair, following an injury to the central nervous system (CNS). Most of the studies on the phenomenon of protective autoimmunity were conducted in experimental settings of various CNS pathologies and thus reside within the scientific discipline of neuroimmunology.  Background  The adaptive immune system primarily consists of T and B cells (lymphocytes), which can respond to specific antigens and subsequently acquire an immunological memory. The activity of adaptive immunity is critically important for host defense against pathogens. Cells of the adaptive immunity that respond to self-antigens are termed ‚Äòautoimmune cells‚Äô. Autoimmunity, the activity of autoimmune cells, is generally considered in the context of an autoimmune disease‚Äîa pathological condition induced by an overwhelming activity of autoimmune cells. One of the hallmarks of immunity is the ability to transfer a substantial amount of lymphocytes or antibodies from one animal to another in a way that results in immunity to a certain pathogen (adaptive transfer). Similarly, autoimmune diseases can be induced experimentally by the adaptive transfer of autoimmune cells or antibodies from an animal that suffers from an autoimmune disease into a healthy animal. In a seminal study of 1999, Schwartz and colleagues demonstrated that the same autoimmune T cells that can cause an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, a common model for multiple sclerosis) can also be harnessed to protect injured CNS tissue from secondary degeneration following a traumatic insult. The experiment showed that after a partial crush injury of the optic nerve, rats injected with activated T cells which are specific for myelin basic protein (MBP, a common protein in the CNS) retained 3-fold more retinal ganglion cells with functionally intact axons than did rats injected with activated T cells specific for other (control) antigens. These findings indicated that at least under certain circumstances, autoimmune activity could exert a beneficial effect by protecting injured neurons from the spread of damage. Additional work by the Schwartz group has shown that protective autoimmunity is a naturally occurring physiological phenomenon that takes place spontaneously following a CNS injury. Mutant mice which lack T cells (such as SCID and nude), and mice that lack T cells that can recognize CNS antigens, exhibit reduced levels of neuronal survival following CNS injury relative to normal (wild type) mice. On the other hand, mice that were genetically engineered so that most of their T cells will recognize a CNS antigen‚Äîsuch as transgenic mice overexpressing a T cell receptor (TcR) for MBP‚Äîexhibit elevated rates of neuronal survival after CNS injury. Experiments conducted in animal models of spinal cord injury, brain injury, glaucoma, stroke, motor neuron degeneration, Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer's disease have demonstrated the relevance of immune cells and in particular T cells that recognize CNS antigens in promoting neuronal survival and functional recovery from acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions. T cells that recognize CNS antigens have also been shown to be important for maintaining the functional integrity of the adult CNS under normal non-pathological conditions. Immune deficient mice and mice which lack T cells that recognize brain antigens exhibit impairments in spatial learning and memory, and have reduced levels of cell renewal in the hippocampus and sub-ventricular zone (the brain structures where neurogenesis takes place in the adult brain). Mechanism of action An immune response that takes place following CNS injury elicits a cascade of molecular and cellular events that can eventually affect the organism‚Äôs functional recovery. Immediately after an injury to the CNS, there is a local innate immune response. This response is mediated primarily by microglia cells, a population of CNS-resident immune cells, which can act as phagocytes, and antigen-presenting cells. CD4+ T helper cells that were specifically activated by antigens associated with the lesion, arrive at the site of injury and locally interact with microglia and other blood-derived antigen presenting cells (e.g. dendritic cells). Local properties of antigen presenting cells (i.e. the levels of MHC-II-self antigen complexes and the type of co-stimulatory molecules) dictate the profile of the subsequent T cell response. The interaction between the T cells and the microglia/dendritic cells results in the production of a set of inflammatory cytokines (such as interferon gamma) and chemokines (chemoatractant proteins) that, in turn, orchestrate the ensuing repair process in which many cell types participate. Microglia and myeloid cells recruited from the circulating blood restrict the spread of damage by buffering excessive levels of toxic self-compounds (such as the neurotransmitter glutamate), and by producing growth factors (such as insulin-like growth factor-1) that prevent neuronal death and induce axonal re-growth. In addition, the chemokines produced at the site of injury attract endogenous stem or progenitor cells that can further contribute to repair by providing a source for new neurons and glial cells, and by restricting the local immune response. The mechanism by which protective autoimmunity maintains the brain‚Äôs functional integrity under non-injurious conditions is still not known. One model suggests that CNS-specific autoimmune T cells which constantly circulate through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interact with perivascular dendritic cells that reside at the choroid plexus and meninges. Cytokines and growth factors secreted into the CSF by the T cells and dendritic cells then diffuse into the neural parenchyma were they locally affect neurons, glial cells and stem cells. This model infers that the level of antigen presentation (i.e. the amount of MHC-II-self antigen complexes) serves as an indicator of the level of immune activity required for maintenance of the uninjured brain. Regulation The outcome of autoimmune activity is determined by several factors, namely: the intensity, the location, and the duration of the autoimmune response. For an autoimmune response to be beneficial, its intensity, duration and site of activity must be tightly regulated. Although autoimmune T cells exist in all healthy individuals, a relatively small portion of the population develops autoimmune diseases. This is due to various mechanisms that constantly regulate the activity of autoimmune cells. One of the prominent autoimmune regulatory mechanisms is a sub-population of T cells called ‚Äòregulatory T cells‚Äô (previously known as ‚Äòsuppressor T cells‚Äô), which restrict autoimmune activity. Experiments in animal models of CNS injury have shown that depletion of regulatory T cells allows an enhanced neuroprotective autoimmune response to take place after the insult. Importantly, however, such an experimental manipulation can at the same time increase the susceptibility to development of an autoimmune disease. Under certain conditions, an initially protective autoimmune response can reach a tipping point, after which it will have a detrimental effect on the tissue, and might even develop into an autoimmune disease. Both genetic and environmental factors (such as infection) can underlie such a transition from a neuroprotective autoimmune response into an overwhelming and detrimental autoimmune disease. Other cell types, such as B cells and even neural progenitor cells, can promote regulation of immune response in the CNS. Stem and progenitor cells are usually regarded with respect to their potential to serve as a source for newly differentiated cells, but recently stem and progenitor cells have also been acknowledged for their ability to modulate immune activity. Experiments have shown that injection of neural progenitor cells into the brain‚Äôs ventricles can modulate an immune response taking place at multiple inflammatory foci in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, or at a single site at the injured spinal cord. Therapeutic implications The concept of protective autoimmunity is relatively new, and it has been shadowed by the historic and yet dominant view of autoimmunity as a damaging factor. Skepticism towards protective autoimmunity has been further fueled by the general concept of the CNS as being an immune privileged site in which immune cell activity is observed only under pathological conditions. Nevertheless, studies during the last decade have established that the immune system has the capacity to orchestrate a multitude of beneficial effects in the adult CNS under both normal and pathological conditions. Such effects range from the molecular level (growth factor production, buffering of toxic self compounds) through the cellular level (induction of axonal regrowth and neurogenesis) to the behavioral level (maintenance of spatial memory). Several approaches have been used experimentally in order to harness naturally occurring immune cell activity in CNS pathologies. Here are key examples: 1\\\\. Therapeutic vaccination: This approach utilizes a common immunological manipulation. Inoculation of an antigen that is associated with the pathology, in this case the site of injury, evokes the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes which can specifically respond to the antigen used. For therapeutic purposes, vaccination with an antigen associated with the site of injury (for example peptides derived from myelin proteins) is problematic, because it carries the risk of inducing, in individuals susceptible to autoimmune diseases, an overwhelming inflammatory response that is detrimental for recovery. To circumvent this problem researchers have been using lower affinity agonists (termed ‚Äòaltered peptide ligands‚Äô) which induce a weaker immune response. Experiments in animal models of spinal cord injury revealed that the use of such altered peptide ligands is effective in promoting functional recovery without the risk of inducing a deleterious autoimmune response. 2\\\\. Alteration of regulatory T cell activity: Suppressing regulatory T cell activity following injury can allow a more robust autoimmune response to take place. For therapeutic purpose, the mere removal of regulatory T cells is, again, highly problematic because it increases the risk of inducing autoimmune diseases. Overcoming this limitation is possible using agents that transiently suppress regulatory T cell activity. Such an agent has been used successfully in an animal model of ischemic stroke, where treated animals exhibited improved neurological recovery relative to non-treated animals.

There is a Brahmalingeshwara Temple which is located on the banks of river Brahmakunda in the northside which then takes a steep turn towards east which increases the beauty of the spot. Legend Kamhasura, an asura, performed Bhairavi Yaga and pleased the divine mother and took a boon that he shouldn't be killed by any male being or entity. The asura having received the boon started wreaking havoc in the three worlds, disturbing peace and good people. The Trimurtis and all the devas prayed to the divine mother to save them from his misdeeds. The goddess sends a messenger to warn him to mend his ways but he does not relent due to his arrogance. To further gain powers, he performs severe penance to please Lord Shiva or Shankara, he suddenly loses his power of speech i.e. he becomes 'mooka' or dumb. In the battlefield he sees the divine mother and at once realizes his follies and misdeeds, but he is unable to beg forgiveness due to his state of being dumb. Jaganmata realizes this and grants him the power of speech; Mookasura( Kamhasura) repents and begs for moksha and asks of his name to stay forever. The divine mother agrees and says after slaying him, she shall be called Mookambika after him. According to Skanda Purana, Goddess Mookambika performed a Marana Homa here after killing Mookasura. After slaying the demon, the divine mother granted divinity to the demon's soul and blessed him to be known as Brahmalingeshwara. The Temple faces east side & the sanctorum faces the north. By the sides of the Sanctorum, the main lord Brahmalingeshwara there is Malayali Yakshi & vata Yakshi & also two Dwarapalakas. To the right of the Sanctorum there is a katte(colloquial Kannada)in which Sri Chakra yantra is established by Adi Shankara. Beside the \\"Brahmalingeshwara Gudi\\" there is a 'Daivadha mane' of Hashaiguli( who came from Kashi or Varanasi), Haiguli, Chikku and other parivara daivas. There is a mother-son relationship between Goddess Mookambika and Shri Brahmalingeshwara. Influenced by Adi Shankara The temple is also influenced by sage Adi Shankaracharya, who established the Sri Chakra at this temple. Therefore, it is called Adi Shankara sthapana. Fair On Makara Sankranthi, like many other temples in Dakshina Kannada, a temple fair is arranged here which attracts a multitude of people from all over the Udupi district and neighbouring districts. The specialty of the place is settling of disputes & promises uttered in the name of God (vaakya teermana)which have a deep influence in the mind of the devotees. People who are possessed by spirits can get cured of the possession by the grace of the lord.People especially troubled by Brahmarakshasa (spirit of a deceased Brahmana who has done misdeeds in life) can get definitive solutions to these kind of problems.

In a land area of 5, 247 square kilometers, the diocesan territory covers the West Khasi Hills and South West Khasi Hills District of Meghalaya state. History The real success and growth of the Catholic Church in West Khasi Hills is solely attributed to the zealous missionaries who dedicated and sacrificed their lives for the Gospel. Some of whom need special mention. The seed of Christianity fell in fertile soil sometimes in 1907, where under the capable supervision and direction of the saintly Father Otto Hopfenmuller SDS, Myntri Langduh Shangdiar and his son Raimondus Rai Khardewsaw found grace in the personal animation of Father Valentinus Karffe SDS and were baptized on 24 January 1907 at Rangthong by the Officiating pastor Father Dominicu Dounderer SDS. The seed blossomed and bear fruit. Raimondus Rai later became the first teacher and Catechist of Rangblang. Rangblang became the first stronghold of Catholicism in the Western zone of Khasi Hills. The colossal contribution of spreading the Gospel of Christ in West Khasi Hills, which dominated the Catholic Arena, was none other than the beloved Father Constantine Vendrame SDB from 1922 onwards. His foot-steps were followed by his followers Father Tome, Foglia, C. Attard, Carmelo Spitale and later Fathers Felix Matta, Costa, Albizuri, Toniguzzo and Vanni Desideri and many others. In the mid-20th century, the nearest Mission station was Marbisu Parish, 76 kilometers away from Nongstoin. The faithful, Catechists and devotees traveled on foot to fulfill their obligations to the Mission station bare-footed for four days forth and back. Father Carmel Attard SDB, the stern and fatherly Maltese missionary was there to receive them. Those were the days of trials but bear fruits that lasted till today. From 1970 onwards, the sacrifice and untiring endeavour of the missionaries boosted the Mission filed in West Khasi Hills (at that time under Assam). The Shillong Diocese felt it necessary to extend the pastoral institutions to the western zone of the diocese. Thus the Parish of St. Peter the Apostle was established on 12 May 1966 at Pyndengrei, Nongstoi√± with Father Emmanuel Albizuri SDB as the first Parish Priest (RIP- Spaniard) and Father John Mary Premoli SDB (an Italian) now in Africa as assistant Parish Priest. These two \\"bulldozer missionaries\\" travelled far and wide on foot covering the present 10 parishes and make it possible for the present Diocese to come into existence. The Diocese of Nongstoin was created by Pope Benedict XVI on 28 January 2006. The Apostolic Nuncio to India, Archbishop Pedro Lopez Quintana, ordained Bishop Victor Lyngdoh on 2 April 2006 and installed him as the first Bishop of Nongstoi√± Diocese on 4 April 2006 amidst turbulent torrential cyclonic rain The diocese was bifurcated from the Archdiocese of Shillong and it includes the whole area of the West and South West Khasi Hills district, Meghalaya. Statistics As of 2009, Nongstoin diocese had 102,900 baptized Catholics, representing 34 percent of all 313,723 people in the territory. The diocese had 18 parishes and 60 mission stations. During 2009, the diocese recorded 4,850 baptisms. According to the current statistics of 2012, the Catholic population is 1,21,231 approximately. In 2015 the Catholic population was 136,142.

It resembles a moss in appearance but is a vascular plant belonging to the division Lycopodiophyta. It has a number of common names including lesser clubmoss, club spikemoss, northern spikemoss, low spikemoss and prickly mountain-moss. This plant has one close relative, Selaginella deflexa, native to Hawaii. These two plants form a small clade that is sister to all other Selaginella species. Description It is a small, delicate, low-growing plant. Its perennial sterile stems are short, slender and irregularly branched reaching up to 15 cm in length. They creep along the ground but usually turn upwards near the tip. They have small, pointed, triangular leaves about 1‚Äì2 mm long, each bearing a ligule on its upper surface near the base. The plant also produces annual fertile shoots. They are more robust than the sterile stems and stand erect. They are usually 3‚Äì6 cm tall and 4‚Äì6 mm across but can grow to 10 cm when conditions are favourable. Their leaves are slightly longer than those of the sterile stems and are spirally arranged around the stem, pointing upwards. The fertile shoots bear stout, yellowish cones which are only slightly differentiated from the branch. The cones usually bear two kinds of sporangia: lobed megasporangia in the lower part of the cone which produce megaspores and simple microsporangia in the upper part which produce many tiny microspores. Distribution and habitat About 1600 metres above sea-level, Rax, Austria It has a near-circumpolar distribution in the northern hemisphere, including northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America including Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. In Europe it occurs south to the Pyrenees, Apennines and Caucasus. In Asia it reaches Japan while in North America it occurs south as far as Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan and Maine. It is found in damp places with neutral to alkaline soils, most often in mountainous areas. It inhabits bogs, the shores of streams and lakes, wet cliffs and ledges, grassland and dune slacks. It is a poor competitor which does not grow in areas with tall, dense vegetation. In North America it mainly grows from 600 to 2900 m above sea-level, occasionally reaching 3800 m. It Britain it has been recorded from sea-level to 1065 m. The species is not considered to be globally threatened but has declined in some areas due to drainage and habitat destruction. In Britain and Ireland it had mostly disappeared from lowland areas by 1930, but its distribution in upland areas remains largely unchanged. Notes *Flora of North America. Selaginella selaginoides.

Squadron A originated with a group of wealthy young gentlemen with great interest in equestrian sport who formed themselves into a group called the 'New York Hussars\\". They adopted blue uniforms and headgear for ceremonial purposes that mimicked Eurasian fashions dating back to the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars. In an effort to become more professional and militarized, they extended membership to Captain Charles F. Roe, 20-year veteran of the US Army Cavalry, who inspired its membership with the cavalry spirit and military discipline. His efforts were successful to the point that in 1889 53 men were mustered into the New York State National Guard as Troop A, becoming the cavalry arm of the Empire State. Squadron A was officially founded.  The Great Wars  Squadron A Armory at Madison Avenue (2010) The squadron's cry \\"Boutez en avant!\\" on the Madison Avenue Armory Squadron A was often called out from its Madison Avenue Armory, which occupied an entire city block between 94th and 95th Streets, to escort presidents, governors, and foreign dignitaries. The Squadron was known for its fine riding skills and elegant uniforms, which it showed off in parades at the National Horse Show. Members of Squadron served as soldiers as well. Volunteer Squadron A troopers served in the Puerto Rican Campaign in 1898, and in 1916 the entire Squadron was called into federal service to patrol the Mexican Border and to support the Pancho Villa Expedition. During World War I, 796 Squadron A members served, and 609 became commissioned officers. As part of the 105th Machine Gun Battalion, the Squadron played an important role in the smashing of the Hindenburg Line. Members were highly decorated, including a Medal of Honor recipient. In World War II the unit was federalized as the 101st Cavalry, Horse/Mechanized in early 1941. Following Pearl Harbor, Squadron A men served in all branches of the armed forces worldwide, and two additional Medals of Honor were earned in addition to an array of other distinctions.  Social activities  In peacetime both between the Wars and directly following, the Squadron was the focus of active social life. Aside from official ceremonial duties, there was indoor polo in the Armory every Saturday night followed by a black tie-dance and many Sunday afternoon tea dances. The 94th Street Armory came down in 1965, but its facade, with the Squadron motto BOUTEZ EN AVANT (Charge!) plaque is still intact, and the Hunter College High School building now occupying the rest of the block takes its architectural cues from the original Armory design. Squadron A memorabilia is maintained in a museum at the Staten Island armory of the 101st Cavalry (Tank), NYARNG, the successor unit to the Squadron, at 321 Manor Road, Castleton Corners, Staten Island.Joseph Berger, New York Times, 2009 Sept 18 On Staten Island, the Fight to Save a Proud Past The 101st was one of the first military units to respond to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 aiding both citizens and police and have been mobilized in support of the Global War on Terror and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

McClean, USAR (ret.) was president of the Association [He died on March 22, 2011, at his Manhattan residence after a lingering illness], which has more than 700 resident and non-resident members. The Squadron A Association maintains an active social agenda with an annual day at the Belmont Racetrack, an annual Memorial Service at the Church of the Heavenly Rest in Manhattan with reception, and a Christmas cocktail party.

Osborn in Garrison, New York, United States. It sits on the hill of the same name, looking down on the Hudson River below. Visible from West Point across the river and traffic on NY 9D passing through Garrison, it has become one of the most recognizable man-made landmarks of the Hudson Highlands. The Osborn family, including paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn and his son, conservationist Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr, has owned and lived in it since it was built by J. Morgan Slade in 1881 as a summer residence, although the original acreage has been subdivided considerably since then. In 1977 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Most of the remaining land is now open to the public for hiking. Property The rough-cut stone castle- like main house is built around a main block with a conical-roofed round tower. Porches and verandas project from many sides of the home to take advantage of the views of the river and mountains in the area. The roof is consistent red slate, with dormers of differing shapes and sizes scattered throughout. One gable to the east uses dressed stone, in contrast with the rest of the building. A north wing with library and extra bedrooms were added later. Four interior chimneys are within the mansion. In 2010, extensive historic restoration work was completed to repair the entire slate roof, tower, dormers, and chimneys. The Highlands Current, ‚ÄúIconic Landmark Undergoing Repairs‚Äù, 09-30-2010. There are several outbuildings and other structures on the original property that are included as contributing resources. To the northeast, on the mountain's summit, is Woodsome Lodge, a rustic log cabin with its own views of the Highlands. The estate's spring-fed wooden water tank is also nearby. A stone arch bridge was added at the same time as the library wing. Stone was also used for a -story gatehouse along the winding driveway leading up to the house from Cat Rock Road (NY 403). Buildings that predate the estate are also included. A -story farmhouse known locally as Wing & Wing, built some years before it was expanded into a contemporary cottage in 1858, is near Route 9D on the open meadows between the road and the hill. Also there is a barn-and-farmhouse complex, with nearby shingled home, built by other landowners at the end of the 19th century. A small guest cottage was later built on a separate property. Another Osborn- estate‚Äìrelated property, The Birches, is at the very corner of Routes 9D and 403. It was used by Osborn's sons after their weddings, and is listed separately on the National Register, but was not formally part of the estate. History In 1855 Osborn, who had been one of the charter officers of the Illinois Central two years earlier, visited the Highlands to take in the fresh air and scenic beauty of the area. He enjoyed his visit so much that he decided to buy the property where Castle Rock and its associated properties now stands. He and his family spent summers in Wing and Wing until the castle was completed the year before he retired from the railroad industry as president of the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad. He lived there until his death in 1894, devoting his time and money to philanthropic activities in New York. It was inherited by his son Henry Fairfield Osborn. Since it was intended as a retirement house, it needed to be expanded to accommodate the younger Osborn's wife and family. The library wing was added in 1906; most of Osborn's paleontological papers were written at Castle Rock. Osborn also made other improvements to the property, including Woodsome Lodge, and other wings that doubled the size of the original castle. Most of these were architecturally sympathetic to Slade's original design, and there has been little change to it since then. In 1974, William Henry Osborn II, one of Henry Fairfield's younger sons, donated the southern portion of the property, which includes Sugarloaf Hill, to the State Parks Council for eventual inclusion in Hudson Highlands State Park. In the late 1970s, after the property was listed on the Register, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation bought of the former estate, including the meadows along Route 9D, and opened it to the public as the Castle Rock Unique Area. Hiking trails now lead through it and up the mountain; however the house property remains private. (Emphasis in original). ReferencesExternal links * Castle Rock at dupontcastle.com.

The Goddess Sri Durgaparameshwari Temple resides here.http://www.mandarthi.templeinfo.in/ The name derives from 'Manda- Aarathi' from Kannada, meaning the holy light. History Long ago the King Shankachooda was ruling Nagaloka. He had five daughters Devarathi, Nagarathi, Charurathi, Mandarathi and Neelarathi. Once they went to Kailasa with an aspiration of marrying the Lord Subramanya Swamy, son of the Lord Shiva. These Five princesses were stopped by Nandi (Lord Shiva‚Äôs Devotee) on their way and cursed to become snakes. Instantaneously they were transformed into snakes and fell down to earth. When Vyaghrapada Maharishi who was wandering in the sahyadri Ghats saw these five snakes caught in the forest conflagration, and knew everything about them by his divine insight. He said to the five princesses (now Snakes) that their curse would be removed by a royal person in due course of time. Meanwhile, the King of Avanthi Devavarma, who had been banished and wandering in disguise in the Sahyadri Mountains, saw these five snakes and decided to save them. He wrapped the snakes with a piece of cloth and started travelling towards the west. The snakes slid out of the cloth wrapper and reached a nearby termite hill. One of the snakes called \\"Mandarathi\\" reached a part of forest, which came to be called as \\"Mandarthi\\" later. Once the nagakanyas appearing in a dream to King Devavarma, intimated that Jalajakshi, the only princess of the King Rajaditya, was in danger. Devavarma promptly saved the princess from the danger and protected her. The King of Hemadri Rajaditya was greatly pleased by this and gave his daughter Jalajakshi in marriage to Devavarma and enthroned him as the King of Hemadri. Once the queen Jalajakshi was seen by Mahisha a demon, who was born from the union of the sage Vyagrapadamuni with thamasic natured Kiratha woman. Mahisha, who was lustful, cast his evil eyes on the queen. He expressed his desire to marry her. When the queen opposed him, he became enraged and tried to possess‚Äô her by force and violence. But all the efforts made by Mahisha were fruitless. The queen Jalajakshi who was deeply hurt and sad went to her palace and told the story husband Devavarma. Later both of them decided to take shelter in the hermitage of Sudevamuni. Then, Mahisha became angry with the muni for giving shelter to the royal couple and sent \\"Mahodara\\" a demon to attack his hermitage. Sage Sudeavamuni was a great Tapaswi who had supernatural powers. He prayed the mother Durga to protect his ashram and the royal couple from Mahodara. All of a sudden a huge termite hill appeared before the demon and swallowed all the weapons used by him. When Mahisha himself started fighting against the muni the royal couple prayed the Divine mother Durga for protection. Then she appeared with all her might and splendor and ordered the divine spirits (Buthaganas) Veerabhadra, Haiguli, Kallukuttiga, Bobbarya to destroy all the demons. Ultimately the demon Mahisha surrendered to the Divine Mother asked for a boon worshipped and the devotees who would do \\"Kenda Seva\\" should be amply rewarded. Later Mahisha laid his soul at the feet of the Divine mother. Sage Sudeva and the royal couple prayed the goddess Durga with fervent devotion .Then mother Durga blessed them with assurance that she would manifest here at Mandarthi with all her power as Vana Durga. Later Devavarma found the idol of Durga in Varahi River as was guided to him by the Lord Subramanya Swamy in a dream and consecrated it with all devotion.Mandarthi History Vana durge was worshipped by the Barkur dynasty. Any festivals, functions in the dynasty was initiated by performing puja at Vana Durge of Mandarthi. As vana durge, the idol had both the hands pointing downwards unlike the idol of today in which the right hand is pointing upwards indicating varada hasta. It is said that more than 1500 years ago due to violent nature of Vana durge generations of archaka families used to get destroyed as punishment to the minute mistakes that used to happen in the kshetra. This phenomenon happened in every generations. When there was no body left in archaka family, royal king of Barkur brought a tulu brahmin family form Alevoor in Udupi District in order to carryout the temple activities. This families can be found today in the surrounding of the temple. It has been found in the records that during the times of 17th and 18th Century the all of the children in the families of archaka used to die leaving only one of the child who carried out the day to day temple work. This phenomenon occurred throughout generations of archaka family. In the 18th century a solution was found out by the groups of archakas to convert the Vana Durge to Durgaparameshwari. It is also possible to convert back the Durgaparameshwari back to Vana durge with the hidden scripts. This would bring back the destruction. During this process a new idol was installed with one of the hands pointing up making Varada hasta. The old idol with both the hands pointing down used to be in the Tulsi katte in front of Veerabhadra until recently when it was removed by temple trust while renovating. Until the early 19th century the temple was under Brahmin families. During British rule the temples used to be the people gathering place where meetings used to happen without he knowledge of the British. To prevent this the bill was passed to make all the temples secular and include people from other castes in the temple trust. The temple has been renovated three times till now. The most recent renovation was done during 1956. This date can be found even today in the pillers of the temple. Festivals The temple celebrates Navarathri in a grand scale with chandihoma on all nine days.http://www.mandarthi.templeinfo.in/ A five-day mathothsava in Makara Masa and Jatra in the month of Kumba are annual and important events while Darshan of Virabhadra and Kalkuda every Friday draws devotees like a magnet. Kenda seve (walking on fire) in front of hayguli and huli devaru is considered to safeguard Mangalya Bhagya (longevity of husband) of the married woman. The various cultural and religious activities and in particular the Yakshagana conducted in the premises of Mandarthi temple reflect the dedication and devotion of the people in continuing the rich traditions of the region.  Language  Kundapura Kannada is the most widely spoken languages in Mandarthi.  Climate  The climate in Mandarthi is hot in summers and pretty good in winter.

As a pitcher, he was famous as an expert spitballer when the pitch was still legal in organized baseball; however, because Shellenback, then 21, was on a minor league roster when the spitball was outlawed after the 1919 season, he was banned from throwing the pitch in the Major Leagues.https://www.baseball- reference.com/bullpen/Spitballhttps://www.baseball- reference.com/bullpen/Frank_Shellenback As a result, Shellenback spent 19 years (1920‚Äì38) ‚Äî the remainder of his active career ‚Äî throwing the spitball legally in the Pacific Coast League. He won a record 295 PCL games. Relegated to minors by 1919 spitball ban Shellenback was a native of Joplin, Missouri, and grew up in Los Angeles. He threw and batted right-handed and stood (188 cm) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg). He became a professional baseball player during World War I and was acquired by the Chicago White Sox at age 19 during the 1918 season. In 36 American League games during 1918‚Äì19, Shellenback won 11 games and lost 15, with an earned run average of 3.06 in 217 innings pitched. He appeared in his last MLB game on July 5, 1919, before his contract was transferred to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. Although Shellenback posted a 7‚Äì3 record there, because of the spitball ban and his minor league status at the time, he would never again pitch in the Majors. Minneapolis sent Shellenback to the Vernon Tigers of the Pacific Coast League at the close of the 1919 campaign, and Shellenback began his long career in the circuit. He would hurl for Vernon, the Sacramento Solons, Hollywood Stars, and San Diego Padres, and win more than 20 games five times, with two 18-game and three 19-game winning seasons as well. All told, as a minor league pitcher, Shellenback won 315 games and lost 192 (for a winning percentage of .621), with an ERA of 3.55 over 4,514 innings.Johnson, Lloyd, The Minor League Register. Durham, North Carolina: Baseball America, 1994 Shellenback's long tenure with Los Angeles-based teams even led to a brief movie career; he had roles in the comedies Fireman, Save My Child (1932) and Alibi Ike (1935).https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0787769/ Both films starred comedian and baseball enthusiast Joe E. Brown, whose son would become known as a successful baseball executive. Manager, coach and longtime scout Shellenback had a long career as a manager, coach, and scout as well. In 1935, still an active pitcher, he took over the managerial reins of the Stars and moved with them to San Diego the following season. There, in 1936, he helped discover and groom one of the greatest hitters of all time, Ted Williams, who signed with the Padres as a 17-year-old pitcher-outfielder out of San Diego's Hoover High School. Williams was soon acquired by the Boston Red Sox, while Shellenback remained manager of the Padres through 1938, winning the 1937 PCL championship. He then became a pitching coach for the St. Louis Browns (1939), Red Sox (1940‚Äì44), Detroit Tigers (1946‚Äì47), and New York Giants (1950‚Äì55), working on two pennant winners and one World Series champion with the Giants of Leo Durocher. During this time, Shellenback was elected to the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame in 1943. Shellenback overcame serious health setbacks (a heart attack in 1948 and an abdominal infection in 1951) to continue his coaching career. He became a Giants scout and minor league pitching instructor in 1956 and continued in that role until his death at age 70 in Newton, Massachusetts.

Both originals (made prior to 1900) and replica's thereof History From an early document by our Patron, Paul Marchand 1976. While M.L. guns were always used in Europe, especially hunting by farmers, there was no shooting club for old gun fans. In the U.S., Red Farris and Oscar Seth held a first shooting match at Portsmouth (Ohio) on 22 February 1931, then founded the N.M.L.R.A. in 1935, and held a yearly championship at Friendship (Indiana) attended by many shooters. Their scope was mainly civil free guns, and folklore, while Europeans were more concerned with military muskets and rifle events. In Europe, the M.L.A.G.B. founded on 25 October 1952, held a first shoot at Bisley on 1 August 1953, then first British Championship on 9 May 1954. In France, some collectors, grouped around Mr Demaison, began to shoot old rifles at the Tir National de Versailles in 1960, and founded a special division of T.N.V. to shoot old guns. They then founded \\"Les Arquebusiers de France\\" in 1962. The first French‚ÄîBritish Championship organized at Bisley on 1 and 2 June 1953 by President Burton of M.L.A.G.B. and Mr Demaison‚ÄîThis \\"Entente Cordiale\\" cup became a yearly event, and attracted, as well as British and French shooters, some foreign spectators. During this time some postal matches were organized with South Africa and U.S.A. The Entente Cordiale continues till this day. In 1967, Piero Vergnano founded the \\"Archibugieri di Piemonte\\" (Torino) and had a first shoot with A d F, in Lyon, on 7 and 8 October 1967. In 1969, the manager of the Deutsches Waffen Journal, Richard Horlacher decided to sponsor M.L. shooting, and organized a first match at Schwtibisch Hall, that was a big success, and became a yearly championship. The rules for M.L. Shooting were different in each country and in 1971, Arquebusiers de France invited all countries interested, to an international championship at Vaudoy-en-Brie, based on roughly agreed rules, and to a provisory international committee: \\"to establish common rules acceptable by all countries involved, so as to permit the use of the international rules for the national matches, with standard guns, and equipment, facilitate postal matches, and to initiate an international committee able to organize championship, and take necessary decisions\\". The response was enthusiastic, with British, German, Italian and Spanish shooters attending the match, and even two members of N.M.L.R.A. ‚Äì U.S.A. ‚Äì Jim Briggs and Thomas Evans. The committee formed by Landry, Marchand and Cunnington for ‚ÄòFrance, Bill Curtis for Great-Britain, Richard Horlacher for Germany, Piero Vergnano and Sterrantino for Italy, Jorge Sichling for Spain, and Jim Briggs for U.S.A., decided: 1) To found a M.L.A. committee- meeting at each yearly championship. 2) To adopt standard shooting rules. 3) To keep as Aim of the a) Develop public interest in old arms thru shooting them as near as reasonably possible to original conditions and style. b) Prevent any alteration spoiling historical value of old weapons, promote intelligent cleaning and repair to save old guns from destruction or damage beyond repair. c) Develop historical research on old guns and on old shooting methods. d) Organize postal and yearly matches, establish shooting rules, publish results, give cups and championship titles, settle all litigations about shooting rules, etc. The first M.L.A.1.C. Championship, due to initiatives of Jorge Sichling, was held on 23 and 24 September 1972 at Madrid, organized by the \\"Federacion Nacional del Tiro Olimpico Espanol\\", under the Presidency of Jose Angel Escorial y San Felice, with British, French, German, Italian and Spanish teams. It was a big success with 31 expert-shooters, and contributed much to start M.L. shooting in Spain. The next year, the 2nd Championship organized by the, M.L.A.G.B. (President E. Burton) at Bisley on 29 and 30 September, saw a greater number of shooters (83), and the miry of Danemark; clay pigeon events were tried, and officially adopted. The third championship was held on 5 and 6 October, at Schlibisch Hall (Germany) organized by the Deutscher Schiitzenbund (President Alfred Michaelis) under the direction of Hans Kowar, with 100 shooters, and addition of Switzerland and Netherlands, and attracted many spectators. The Fourth championship has been organized by the FIATA (Federazione Italiana Associazoni Tiro ad Avancarica), at Codogno, on 27 and 28 September 1975, with participation of South African and Austrian Teams, with 8 records broken.

Simplicius, was, according to tradition, a Christian of the Abruzzi region who was executed along with his two sons, Constantius and Victorian, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Their Passio contains all of the tropes of the genre. It is believed that the martyrdoms are genuine but that the three martyrs were not necessarily related to one another, but were executed together at Marsica. The earliest source on their life actually dates from a Passio of 1406. The Passio states that Simplicius and his entire family, natives of Bourgogne, were baptized by Saint Januarius (not, according to Antonio Borrelli, the famous saint of Naples) during the reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161). Gaudentia, the wife of Simplicius, became a nun and withdrew to a monastery, while Simplicius and his two sons Constantius and Victorinus preached on behalf of their new religion. Pontius, the prefect in Gaul, was ordered to arrest all Christians; Simplicius and his two sons were arrested and led in front of the court, where they preached the Trinity and the Absolution. They were flogged and sent to Rome in order to be condemned to death. According to the legend, during the journey, the saints cured a child of blindness. At Rome, they wished to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul, but the guards prohibited this. However, God liberated them from their chains, allowing them to make the pilgrimage to the tombs with a group of Christians. The pilgrimage resulted in a fight erupting between the Christians and pagans; the pagans suffered many losses. The three saints were once again arrested and brought to Antoninus Pius at Marsica. In the presence of the emperor, the three saints refused to abjure their faith, and were tossed into a chamber filled with snakes and scorpions, but they emerged unharmed due to the intercession of an angel. They were then condemned to be torn apart by four maddened heifers, but these beasts refused to move. Finally, on August 26, 159, they were beheaded at Celano, at a spot called Aureum fontem (\\"Golden Springs\\"), identified by the writer of the Passio as the future site of the church of San Giovanni Vecchio in Celano, with the spring eventually becoming known as S. Ioannis in capite acquae. After the death of the three saints, an earthquake shook the town and one of the executioners was converted to Christianity, with the deacon named Florentius, a witness to the event, writing down and passing down the news of their deaths. Veneration Evidence of their cult in the Marsica region can be found as early as the 11th century, when Bishop Pandolphus (Pandolfo) received a letter from Pope Stephen IX in 1057, which recognized the authenticity of the relics of the three martyrs, which were found underneath the principal altar of San Giovanni Vecchio, anciently the Collegiata di Celano. Frederick II destroyed the city in 1222, exiling all of its male inhabitants to Malta and Sicily. When the city was rebuilt on the Hill of San Vittorino, the relics were translated to the chapel of the new church there, on June 10, 1406, which occasioned the writing of the aforementioned Passio. Their names were inserted into the Roman Martyrology under August 26 in 1630.

He played football with his local clubs Father Griffins and Salthill-Knocknacarra and was a member of the Galway senior inter-county team from 1966 until 1979. Sammon later served as manager of the Galway senior inter-county team from 2007 until 2009. Playing career=Minor and under-21 Sammon first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Galway minor football team in the early 1960s. He later progressed to the Galway under-21 football team. In 1965, he lined out in the provincial under-21 decider with Mayo providing the opposition. Galway won the game by 3‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì13, and Sammon collected a Connacht Under-21 Football Championship title. His side was defeated in the subsequent All-Ireland semi- final. Senior Sammon joined the Galway senior inter-county team as a nineteen-year-old in 1966. In the Connacht final, Galway secured a 0‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì8 victory over Mayo, winning Sammon a first Connacht Senior Football Championship winners' medal. Galway beat Cork by 2 points in the All-Ireland semi-final, reaching their fourth consecutive championship final, this time with Meath providing the opposition. It was Sammon's first championship decider, and Galway were looking for a third All-Ireland title in-a-row, while Meath were looking for their third All-Ireland title ever. Galway's Mattie McDonagh scored the only goal of the game, when a long clearance found him unmarked at the edge of the Meath square. At half-time Meath trailed by 1‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì1. They fought back after the interval; however, Galway won their three-in- a-row by 1‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì7. It was Sammon's first All-Ireland winners' medal. Galway did not achieve four-in-a-row the following season, as Sammon's side were defeated in the early stages of the 1967 provincial championship. The team regrouped and qualified for the provincial decider again in 1968. Reigning champions Mayo were the opponents in a game which Galway won 2‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì9. Sammon added a second provincial winners' medal to his collection. There would be no subsequent All-Ireland final appearance as soon-to-be champions Down narrowly defeated Galway in the semi-final. In 1969 Galway exited the championship at the hands of Mayo in the Connacht final after a draw and a replay. Sammon's side was back in the provincial final again in 1970, this time with Roscommon providing the opposition in the first eighty-minute decider. Sammon's side won comfortably by 2‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì8. In the subsequent All- Ireland semi-final, however, Meath beat Galway by 0‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì11. In 1971 Sammon was appointed captain of the Galway team. His side retained their Connacht title that year but not without some difficulty. Sligo were the opponents and held Sammon's side to a 2‚Äì15 apiece draw. In the replay, Galway secured a narrow 1‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì10 victory. It was Sammon's fourth Connacht winners' medal. A second All-Ireland final appearance beckoned with Offaly lining out in opposition. In the game, a Murt Connor goal gave Offaly a lead; however, Galway's S√©amus Leyden scored an equalising goal almost immediately. Offaly tacked on three more points to secure a 1‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì8 win and their first All- Ireland title. In spite of this defeat Sammon was later included on the very first GAA All-Star team. Galway surrendered their provincial title at an early stage in 1972, however, Sammon was appointed captain again in 1973. That year his side faced Mayo in the Connacht decider. A high-scoring 1‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì12 score line gave Galway the win and gave Sammon a fifth Connacht title. After an absence of seven years the westerners were back in the All-Ireland final. Cork provided the opposition, and Jimmy Barry-Murphy scored the first of his two goals after just two minutes to give Cork the initiative. Jimmy Barrett scored the third of Cork's goals as a tally of 2‚Äì13 was not enough to save Sammon's side. A seven-point deficit resulted in another All-Ireland final defeat for Sammon. A second All-Star award quickly followed. In 1974 Galway retained their Connacht title. A 2‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì8 win over Roscommon gave Sammon his sixth provincial winners' medal. For the second year in succession and for the third time in four years, Galway lined out in the All-Ireland championship decider. Dublin were the opponents on that occasion. The men from the west took a 1‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì5 lead at half-time. In the 52nd minute, Galway were awarded a penalty which Sammon stepped up to take. Goalkeeper Paddy Cullen made no mistake and saved the shot. 'The Dub's' later went on to take the lead as Galway collapsed. A 0‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì6 score line resulted in a demoralising third All- Ireland defeat for Sammon. An early exit from the championship was Galway's lot in 1975, however, the team bounced back in 1976. A 1‚Äì8 apiece draw was the result of the Connacht final against Roscommon. The replay was far more conclusive with Sammon collecting a seventh provincial winners' medal after a 1‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì9 victory. The Galway revival was short-lived as Sammon's side were subsequently defeated by Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final. The end of the 1970s belonged to Roscommon in the provincial championship. Back-to-back Connacht final defeats in 1977 and 1978 were followed by an early exit from the championship in 1979. This defeat brought Sammon's inter-county career to an end. Managerial career=2008 Championship All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 2008 In September 2007, Sammon was confirmed as the new Galway senior football boss, receiving a three-year term and succeeding Peter Ford in the hot seat. His appointment meant that Galway had a native in charge of their premier football team for the first time in almost 10 years. Sammon is the second oldest inter-county manager on the scene at the moment after Mick O'Dwyer. Sammon's backroom team includes former Galway defender Richie Fahey, Dunmore McHales Tom Ryder and another former county player, Jimmy O'Dea, of Tuam Stars. On 19 May 2008, Galway won Connacht Senior Football Championship first round clash against Roscommon at Pearse Stadium by a comfortable 2‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì06 scoreline. Sammon said \\"I didn't think we would win by so much. I would have settled for one or two points, I thought that's how close it would be.\\" after the match. Their semi-final clash against Leitrim also at Pearse Stadium, saw Galway win by 2‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì13. Sammon wasn't entirely satisfied with Galway's performance and felt there was plenty of room for improvement ahead of the Connacht final against Mayo. \\"Goals are so important and they win games. We were fortunate when we got two and were disappointed that we gave one away. We were giving away goals in the early away goals in the early rounds of the league and we worked on stopping that, so we're not happy.\\" On 13 July 2008, Galway won their 44th Connacht SFC after beating Mayo by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì14 in a provincial decider at McHale Park. Sammon warmly greeted the victory after the final. \\"Any time you can win, it certainly stands to you, particularly down here in Castlebar. It is a very difficult places to win in,\\" he said. In the quarter-finals, Galway played reigning All-Ireland Champions Kerry. A spirited performance from the Tribesmen was not enough as Kerry won by 5 points, 1‚Äì21 to 1‚Äì16. Sammon said after the match, \\"Kerry were brilliant today. They just proved what a great team they are. Any team that is going for three-in-a-row deserves the respect and plaudits that they get. Looking back, I think that it has been a successful year for Galway as we brought on a number of young players. I felt at one stage when we got the goal that if we had pressed forward and gotten a point or two more, we might have gone ahead. But that is the sign of a great team ‚Äì any time they are under pressure that they are able to come back and score\\". In his assessment of Galways season, he added \\"Looking back, I think that it has been a successful year for Galway as we brought on a number of young players.\\" References 1946 births Living people People from Galway (city) Fr.

Career Lindbeck first gained attention as a medievalist and as a participant in ecumenical discussions in academia and the church. He was a \\"delegate observer\\" to the Second Vatican Council and since that time he has been an important part of ecumenical dialogue, especially between Lutherans and Roman Catholics. From 1968 to 1987 he was a member of the Joint Commission between the Vatican and Lutheran World Federation. In 1994, Lindbeck spoke at length about his memories of Vatican II with George Weigel, and a transcript of his interview with Weigel was published in the December 1994 edition of First Things. His best-known work is The Nature of Doctrine: Religion and Theology in a Postliberal Age, published in 1984. It was widely influential and is one of the key works in the formation and founding of postliberal theology. He was appointed to the Yale Divinity School faculty in 1952 before his studies were finished, and remained there until his retirement in 1993.

She received a number of prominent awards and honors and wrote four best selling books. Judith Wallerstein was born on December 27, 1921 as Judith Hannah Saretsky in New York City. Her father died from cancer when she was 8 years old. Wallerstein received her bachelor's degree from Hunter College (1943), her Master's in social work from Columbia University (1946) and her Doctorate in psychology from Lund University in Sweden (1978). She died at 90 years old June 18, 2012 from an unexpected intestinal obstruction in Piedmont, California. She was married for 65 years to the academic Robert S. Wallerstein.  Career  Judith Wallerstein taught as the senior lecturer from 1966 to 1991 at the University of California, Berkeley. She held faculty positions at the University of California, The Hebrew University, and Pahlavi University Medical School. In addition, she also lectured at Harvard, Cornell, Stanford, and Yale. Wallerstein was a consultant for the Advisory Commission on Family Law to the California Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Justice, The Commission on Law and Mental Health, State Bar of California, and the California Senate Task Force on Family Equity. In 1980, she founded the ‚ÄúJudith Wallerstein Center for the Family in Transition‚Äù in Madera, California. The center provided counseling and education for divorcing couples and their children. In addition, the center conducted a variety of research pertaining to divorce and the family. Judith Wallerstein's three best-selling books about children and divorce were: Second Chances, The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce, and What About the Kids. In 1995, she published a book titled The Good Marriage: How and Why Love Lasts, which was about making marriage succeed. Wallerstein received many awards including: the Distinguished Teaching Award from the University of California, The Koshland Award in Social Welfare from the San Francisco Foundation, Commendation from the State of California Senate Rules Subcommittee, the Rene Spitz Lectureship from the Denver Psychoanalytic society, election to Who's Who in American Science, the Dale Richmond Award of the American Academy of Pediatrics, etc.  Research  Wallerstein's career was centered around a 25-year-long longitudinal study, the \\"California Children of Divorce Study,\\" investigating the effects that divorce has on families. She began her study in 1971 with Joan B. Kelly. She followed 131 children between the ages of 3 and 18 from 60 divorced families in Marin County, California for 25 years, with intensive interviews conducted every 5 years From her research Wallerstein found that only 40% of children from divorce actually marry. She discovered that the effects of divorce are more long lasting than most assume. The age of child at the time of the divorce really matters, the largest impact occurs during the period where the child of divorce is a young adult wanting a romantic relationship but afraid of failure. Wallerstein also found that the quality of post-divorce life is crucial for the children. In addition, she found that rates of financial support for college decrease after a divorce due to the large expense of the divorce itself.  Criticisms  Although Judith Wallerstein had many allies and a number of best-selling books, she also had critics. Some criticized her for the families she studied that were all middle class and the parents were all well-educated, Wallerstein was criticized for not having a wider variety. Wallerstein's study exclusively examined middle- class Californians whose participants were pre-selected for therapy and psycho-analysis. She influenced a California court on child relocation, and was criticized by Richard A. Gardner.The Burgess Decision and the Wallerstein Brief, Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, 26(3):425-431, 1998, http://www.fact.on.ca/Info/pas/gard98a.htm Feminists felt that Wallerstein was trying to encourage women to stay in bad marriage and discouraging divorce.

A cape jutting out north from the island, it faces the South China Sea on the west, and the Pacific Ocean on the east. On a particularly clear day, the island of Yoron (Yoronjima) in Kagoshima Prefecture can be seen on the horizon. Yoron Island is located approximately to the north. Cape Hedo is part of Okinawa Dai Sekirinzan Quasi-National Park, a prefectural park established in 1965 and re-established with the reversion of Okinawa to Japan in 1972. In the Sh≈çh≈ç Kuniezu, a kuniezu, or series of Japanese provincial land maps created during the Edo period (1603 - 1868), Cape Hedo appears as \\"Heto misaki\\", or \\"Cape Heto\\". The expedition of Commodore Perry (1794 - 1858) visited Cape Hedo and recorded it as \\"Cape Hope\\" in his Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan. The Nihon Suiroshi, a pilot guide first issued in 1892, records that the cape is also known as Cape Kunigami and is commonly used as a nautical landmark. The site has become a tourist destination, both for its location, and for the monument erected there commemorating the end of US Occupation and return of Okinawa to Japanese sovereignty. The monument is popularly seen as a photo opportunity by tourists; as tourism to the site has grown, a number of restaurants, souvenir shops, and other tourist facilities have appeared near the site. According to legends of Okinawan history, Okinawan king Gihon (r. c. 1248‚Äì1260) fled the capital after abdicating the throne and disappeared into the forest.

Process corners represent the extremes of these parameter variations within which a circuit that has been etched onto the wafer must function correctly. A circuit running on devices fabricated at these process corners may run slower or faster than specified and at lower or higher temperatures and voltages, but if the circuit does not function at all at any of these process extremes the design is considered to have inadequate design margin. To verify the robustness of an integrated circuit design, semiconductor manufacturers will fabricate corner lots, which are groups of wafers that have had process parameters adjusted according to these extremes, and will then test the devices made from these special wafers at varying increments of environmental conditions, such as voltage, clock frequency, and temperature, applied in combination (two or sometimes all three together) in a process called characterization. The results of these tests are plotted using a graphing technique known as a shmoo plot that indicates clearly the boundary limit beyond which a device begins to fail for a given combination of these environmental conditions. Corner-lot analysis is most effective in digital electronics because of the direct effect of process variations on the speed of transistor switching during transitions from one logic state to another, which is not relevant for analog circuits, such as amplifiers. Significance to digital electronics In Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) integrated circuit microprocessor design and semiconductor fabrication, a process corner represents a three or six sigma variation from nominal doping concentrations (and other parameters) in transistors on a silicon wafer. This variation can cause significant changes in the duty cycle and slew rate of digital signals, and can sometimes result in catastrophic failure of the entire system. Variation may occur for many reasons, such as minor changes in the humidity or temperature changes in the clean-room when wafers are transported, or due to the position of the die relative to the center of the wafer. Types of corners When working in the schematic domain, we usually only work with front end of line (FEOL) process corners as these corners will affect the performance of devices. But there is an orthogonal set of process parameters that affect back end of line (BEOL) parasitics.  FEOL corners  One naming convention for process corners is to use two-letter designators, where the first letter refers to the N-channel MOSFET (NMOS) corner, and the second letter refers to the P channel (PMOS) corner. In this naming convention, three corners exist: typical, fast and slow. Fast and slow corners exhibit carrier mobilities that are higher and lower than normal, respectively. For example, a corner designated as FS denotes fast NFETs and slow PFETs. There are therefore five possible corners: typical-typical (TT) (not really a corner of an n vs. p mobility graph, but called a corner, anyway), fast-fast (FF), slow-slow (SS), fast-slow (FS), and slow-fast (SF). The first three corners (TT, FF, SS) are called even corners, because both types of devices are affected evenly, and generally do not adversely affect the logical correctness of the circuit. The resulting devices can function at slower or faster clock frequencies, and are often binned as such. The last two corners (FS, SF) are called \\"skewed\\" corners, and are cause for concern. This is because one type of FET will switch much faster than the other, and this form of imbalanced switching can cause one edge of the output to have much less slew than the other edge. Latching devices may then record incorrect values in the logic chain.  BEOL corners http://abelite-da.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/C8.png  In addition to the FETs themselves, there are more on-chip variation (OCV) effects that manifest themselves at smaller technology nodes. These include process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variation effects on on-chip interconnect, as well as via structures. Extraction tools often have a nominal corner to reflect the nominal cross section of the process target. Then the corners cbest and cworst were created to model the smallest and largest cross sections that are in the allowed process variation. A simple thought experiment shows that the smallest cross section with the largest vertical spacing will produce the smallest coupling capacitance. CMOS Digital circuits were more sensitive to capacitance than resistance so this variation was initially acceptable. As processes evolved and resistance of wiring became more critical, the additional rcbest and rcworst were created to model the minimum and maximum cross sectional areas for resistance. But the one change is that cross sectional resistance is not dependent on oxide thickness (vertical spacing between wires) so for rcbest the largest is used and for rcworst the smallest is used. Accounting for corners To combat these variation effects, modern technology processes often supply SPICE or BSIM simulation models for all (or, at the least, TT, FS, and SF) process corners, which enables circuit designers to detect corner skew effects before the design is laid out, as well as post-layout (through parasitics extraction), before it is taped out.

The site was determined elible for the National Historic Register in 1983, but omitted due to owner's objection. The mills were organized in 1863 with William Mason as president and Charles O. Shove as treasurer. The original Mill No. 1 was built 1864. It was 328 feet long by 70 feet wide and five stories high with a barn roof. The mill did not begin operation until January 1865, however. Mill No. 1 was destroyed by fire on September 19, 1874. Twenty three workers were killed in the disaster, and thirty three more were injured.The Cotton Mills of Fall River Workers on the upper floors faced a desperate choice, either jump five stories to the ground, or be burned to death.South Coast Today - Learning from the mistakes of the past The tragic fire was widely publicized in the press and became the subject of several folk songs found throughout New England and New York, as well as Nova Scotia, where many of the workers came from. The scandal led to reforms in the design of future mill buildings, requiring multiple exits and fire escapes. Mill No. 1 was soon rebuilt, but with a flat roof and a fire sprinkler system. The rebuilt Mill No. 1 was powered by a 650-horsepower Corliss engine, fed by twenty four boilers. Mill No. 2 was constructed in 1871 at the corner of Bedford Street and Robeson, from local Fall River granite in the Italianate style. It is 378 feet long by 74 feet wide. Originally five stories with a barn roof. The sixth floor was flattened to a full story after the tragic 1874 fire in Mill No.1, due to safety concerns. This mill was powered by a 750-horsepower Corliss engine. Water for the steam-powered mills was drawn through a canal from the Quequechan River. Mill No. 3 was built in 1893, also in granite, but wider and with less ornamentation. It measured 510 feet long by 127 feet wide. The front half of the mill is two stories, while the rear part is three stories. The company also built nearly one hundred triple decker tenement houses nearby for the accommodation of its workers.Earle, 1877, pg. 124 By 1917, the company had a capacity of 122,048 spindles and 3,000 looms. In 1932 the Granite Mills were acquired by the Pepperell Manufacturing Company,Phillips History of Fall River and continued to operate into the 1950s. Mill No. 1 was demolished in 1961 for a supermarket, which later became China Royal restaurant. The site now contains various businesses, including a CVS, Boston Market and a bank. From 1959, Mill No. 2 was the home of suit maker Anderson-Little until it closed in 1998.Fall River Herald News, March 15, 1975Herald News July 16, 2008 The building is now occupied by various businesses. Mill No. 3 was for many years occupied by Globe Manufacturing, which manufactured rubber-based goods, including Spandex. On July 28, 2011 a smoldering fire start by a spark from a torch during remodeling of the building damaged some of the floor and caused about 10,000 dollars in damage.Herald News, July 28, 2011 This mills now contains the Granite Block Global Data Center.Fall River Herald News, May 30, 2011 See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Fall River, Massachusetts *List of mills in Fall River, Massachusetts References Industrial buildings completed in 1871 Industrial buildings completed in 1893 Textile mills in Fall River, Massachusetts ","title":"Granite Mills"},{"id":"18648203","text":"Schenectady High School is a high school located at 1445 The Plaza in Schenectady, New York, USA.

A financial worker by trade, he also wrote poetry. He lived in London for most of his life. Biography Early in his life he converted to Protestantism and his own Roman Catholic father, Richard Milton, subsequently disowned him. He moved to London around 1583 to work as an apprentice scrivener. His work largely pertained to business matters; often working as a moneylender or a financial broker. He registered with the Company of Scriveners on 27 February 1599. Soon after this he started a family, marrying Sara Jeffrey (c. 1572‚Äì1637) and living in Bread Street, London, with her parents. Records show the couple had six children, three of whom reached adulthood. The three surviving children were Anne, John Milton (the poet) and Christopher Milton (a judge who was later awarded a knighthood). Similar to his first son of the same name, Milton wrote poetry. Two poems are known to have existed: a sonnet and a poem dedicated to John Lane‚Äîboth unpublished. Milton's main creative outlet, however, was composing music. Twenty musical compositions are verified as belonging to Milton. All but one of his compositions contained a religious theme. Milton succeeded in publishing his works in Thomas Morley's The Triumphs of Oriana (1601), William Leighton's The Tears or Lamentations of a Sorrowful Soul (1612) and Thomas Ravenscroft's The Whole Book of Psalms (1621), amongst others. Other works survived as manuscripts under the care of John Browne, a Parliamentary clerk, and Thomas Myriell, a personal friend of the composer. Milton's work made the family so prosperous that they could afford to employ private tutors of classical languages for their sons and later send them to school and university. This affluence also meant that his eldest son, John Milton, never had to work and thus spent his time focusing on writing. Milton also ensured that his eldest son was thoroughly educated in music. In 1631 Milton and his family moved from Bread Street to Hammersmith where he resided until his retirement in 1636. Thereafter he moved with his wife to Horton, Buckinghamshire. However, Sara died shortly after on 3 April 1637 and she was buried in the aisle of the parish church. Milton moved to Reading, Berkshire in 1641 to live with his youngest son but after the Siege of Reading he moved back to London, living with his eldest son, John Milton. After his son reconciled with his wife the family moved to the Barbican. He remained there until his death and was buried on 15 March 1647 in St Giles Cripplegate.

A law review is a type of legal periodical.William H. Putman and Jennifer Albright. \\"II. Legal periodicals\\". Legal Research. Third Edition. Cengage Learning. 2015. Pages 241 to 243 et seq. Legal Research, Analysis, and Writing. Fourth Edition. 2018. Pages 193 and 194 et seq. Typically, the law students initiate the production of the journals, with the publication of articles that are authored by law faculty and law scholars. The law students add references, notes and comments in the topics contained in the reviews. Law reviews are generated in almost all law bodies/institutions worldwide. However, in recent years, some have claimed that the traditional influence of law reviews is declining.Adam Liptak. When Rendering Decisions, Judges Are Finding Law Reviews Irrelevant. The New York Times. 19 March 2007. The law reviews are a source of research, imbedded with analyzed and referenced legal topics; they also provide a scholarly analysis of emerging law concepts from various topics, such as Administrative Law, Animal Welfare Law, Antitrust and Competition, Common Law and Torts & Insurance, to mention a few. Overview The primary function of a law review is to publish scholarship in the field of law. Law reviews publish lengthy, comprehensive treatments of subjects (referred to as \\"articles\\"), that are generally written by law professors, judges, or legal practitioners. The shorter pieces, attached to the articles, commonly called \\"notes\\" and \\"comments,\\" are written by law student \\"members\\" of the law review. Law review articles often express the thinking of specialists or experts with regard to problems, in a legal setting, with potential solutions to those problems. Historically, law review articles have been influential in the development of the law; they have been frequently cited as persuasive authority by the courts almost worldwide.  In North America  In the US, law reviews are normally edited and published by an organization of students at a law school or through a bar association, in close collaboration with faculty members. For example, Justice Stanley Mosk of the Supreme Court of California admitted that he got the idea for market share liability from the Fordham Law Review comment cited extensively in the court's landmark decision in Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories (1980).Hon. Stanley Mosk, Oral History Interview (Berkeley: California State Archives Regional Oral History Office, 1998), 62. Most major American law schools publish a law review (or \\"law journal\\"), generally dealing with all areas of law and named after the school, and some publish specialized reviews, dealing with a particular area of the law, in addition to or in place of the general law review, such as civil rights and civil liberties, international law, environmental law, or human rights. There are also a small number of journals focusing on statutory, regulatory, and public policy issues. See List of law reviews in the United States for details.  In Europe  In Europe, law reviews \\"contribute to legal scholarship on the place of Europe in the world\\" and \\"serve[s] as a forum where the national, international and EU perspectives meet and engage.\\" The reviews focus a lot on the themes of \\"political science and international relations contributions\\" and how they relate and interact with the complex policies and principles of \\"EU‚Äôs external relations.\\"  In Africa  In Africa, law reviews have focused on a wide range of issues: from \\"legal pluralism and customary law'\\" to \\"issues of international law in the African context,\\" including \\"legal and institutional regional and sub-regional developments, post conflict resolution, constitutionalism, commercial law and environmental law.\\" Some reviews have fostered a discussion on reforms and changes in political and economic administrations. The Journal of African Law has published articles from LGBT rights in Malawi to the rights of indigenous peoples under the African Charter on Human and Peoples‚Äô Rights.  Trends  In recent years, many law reviews have started to publish online-only content in addition to their respective print issues. They offer freely available pieces of short-form legal scholarship, analysis, and commentary. Further, some law journals have abandoned print entirely, instead choosing to publish all of their content only on the Internet. Editorial staff= United States  In the United States, law reviews are typically edited by a certain percentage of the top students in the class or students who are selected to join after successfully completing a ‚Äúwrite on competition‚Äù at the end of their first year of law school. As law professor Erwin N. Griswold wrote of the Harvard Law Review: \\"Some people are concerned that a major legal periodical in the United States is edited and managed by students. It is an unusual situation, but it started that way, and it developed mightily from its own strength\\".Erwin N. Griswold, \\"The Harvard Law Review ‚Äì Glimpses of Its History as Seen by an Aficionado\\" (1987). During the 1990s, the American Bar Association followed suit and began coordinating its own practitioner journals with law schools, courting student editorial bodies for publications including Administrative Law Review, The International Lawyer, Public Contract Law Journal, and The Urban Lawyer. Despite Griswold's confidence in student editors, criticism of this practice continues. In 2004, Judge Richard Posner wrote a critical account entitled \\"Against the Law Reviews\\" in the magazine Legal Affairs. However, Posner also wrote that his own time as president of the Harvard Law Review represented a \\"Golden Age ... for student-edited law reviews\\".Posner, Richard A., \\"The Future of the Student-Edited Law Review\\" in Stan. L. Rev. Vol. 47, No. 6, (1995): 1133  Canada  In Canada, the fully student-run law reviews (without a Faculty editor-in-chief) include, in order of the frequency they are cited by the Supreme Court of Canada: the McGill Law Journal, the Queen's Law Journal, the Alberta Law Review, University of British Columbia Law Review, the University of Ottawa Law Review, the Saskatchewan Law Review, and the University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review. The country also has several specialized publications run entirely by students.  Europe  Outside North America, student-run law reviews are the exception rather than the norm. In Continental Europe law reviews are almost uniformly edited by academics. However, a small number of student-edited law reviews have recently sprung into existence in Germany (Ad Legendum, Bucerius Law Journal, Freilaw Freiburg Law Students Journal, Goettingen Journal of International Law, Hanse Law Review, Heidelberg Law Review, Marburg Law Review), the Netherlands (Ars Aequi, Groningen Journal of International Law) and the Czech Republic (Common Law Review). Two student-run publications have also been established in Italy: Bocconi Legal Papers, adopting the format of a working paper series, as a way to complement ‚Äì rather than compete with ‚Äì peer-reviewed publications and offer scholars an additional round of feedback;Longobardi, F. & Russi, L. (2009), A Tiny Heart Beating: Student-Edited Legal Periodicals in Good Ol' Europe , German Law Journal 10:7 University of Bologna Law Review, a double- blind peer reviewed law journal, run by University of Bologna, School of Law students, which follows The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation. = Belgium = In Belgium, the oldest and most prominent student-edited law review is Jura Falconis. It was founded by a group of students from the Law Faculty of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven who, in 1964, conceived the idea of producing their own law journal grafted on the famous American law reviews. Since then, Jura Falconis has grown into a very solid and most unusual value in the Belgian legal literature. = France = The articles in the leading law reviews in France are written by academics and lawyers, the principal editors are Dalloz, LexisNexis, Lamy (part of the international Wolters Kluwer group) and Francis Levebvre. = United Kingdom = Within the United Kingdom, as in much of the Commonwealth outside North America (a notable exception being Australia), all of the leading law reviews are edited and run by academics. The leading law reviews in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth more generally are the Law Quarterly Review (first published 1885),Official website of LQR the Modern Law Review (first published 1937),Official website of MLR the Cambridge Law Journal (first published 1973),Official website of CLJ The Oxford Journal of Legal Studies (first published 1981)Official website of OJLS and Legal Studies (first published 1981).Official website of Legal Studies The Bracton Law Journal (now Exeter Law Review) was the first student-run law review when it began publishing in 1965. Since then, the Birkbeck Law Review, Bristol Law Review, Cambridge International Law Journal, Cambridge Student Law Review, Dundee Student Law Review, Durham Law Review, Edinburgh Student Law Review, King‚Äôs Student Law Review, Warwick Student Law Review, Southampton Student Law Review, Strathclyde Law Review, the UCL Human Rights Review and the Student Journal of Law have also emerged. = Italy = The University of Bologna Law ReviewThe University of Bologna Law Review is a student-run law journal published by the Department of Legal Studies of the University of Bologna, and officially sponsored by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and the International Chamber of Commerce - Italy. Its editorial board is composed of more than 150 members, including students, scholars, and professionals from all over the world. The Trento Student Law ReviewThe Trento Student Law Review is a student-run law review based in Trento, Italy. Established in 2017, it published its first issue, titled \\"Number Zero\\", in January 2018.http://hosting.unitn.it/ojs/web2/index.php/TheTSLR/issue/view/5] Bocconi Legal Papers is a student-edited law journal in Italy. It is a project sponsored by Bocconi School of Law and is published by a group of students belonging to the same institution, under the supervision of several faculty advisors. = Ireland = The main professionally edited law reviews in Ireland include the following: *Bar Review *Commercial Law Practitioner *Construction, Engineering and Energy Law Journal *Conveyancing and Property Law Journal *Dublin University Law Journal *Hibernian Law Journal *Irish Criminal Law Journal *Irish Employment Law Journal *Irish Planning and Environmental Law Journal *Irish Probate Law Journal *Irish Law Times *Irish Journal of Family Law *Irish Journal of Practice and Procedure *Medico-Legal Journal of Ireland *The Irish Jurist The leading student law reviews are the Dublin City University Law Review, the Trinity College Law Review, the UCD Law Review, the Irish Student Law Review and the Cork Online Law Review. = The Netherlands = In the Netherlands, Ars Aequi is one of the few general legal journals. It has been published since 1951. It is edited by students from all faculties of law of Dutch universities, who review and edit submitted articles (peer review is not common in Dutch law journals). The quality of its publications are considered top-ranked in the Dutch legal discipline.Rob A.J. van Gestel, Kwaliteit van juridische publicaties, in: Ruth H. de Bock, Peter J.P.M. van Lochem & Rob A.J. van Gestel (eds.), \\"Kwaliteit als keuze: kwaliteit(sbeoordeling) van rechtspraak, wetgeving en rechtswetenschappelijk onderzoek, Kluwer 2015. Ars Aequi publishes articles written by established scholars, researchers and students. The editorial board does however not set different quality standards for student articles. Ars Aequi has published its Black Issue in 1970, criticizing legal aid. It resulted in reforms of accessible legal aid in the Netherlands. = Nordic countries = In Iceland, √ölflj√≥tur Law Review, has been in publication since 1947. In 2007 it celebrated its 60th anniversary. Since its creation in 1947 it has been edited and run by students at the Department of Law, University of Iceland. √ölflj√≥tur Law Review is the most senior of all academic journals still in publication at the university and held in great respect by Icelandic jurists and legal scholars. In Finland, Helsinki Law Review, edited by students at the University of Helsinki, has been active since 2007. Earlier, the University of Turku published Turku Law Journal from 1999 to 2003. Sweden's first law review is Juridisk Publikation. The first number of Juridisk Publikation was published in April 2009. It originated as a review by students from Stockholm University. It is now delivered to Swedish law students from all universities, as well as to most legal libraries in the country. Juridisk Publikation is edited by top students from the law schools in Lund, Stockholm Uppsala, Gothenborg and Ume√•. The publication is anonymously peer reviewed by a board of leading Swedish legal practitioners and academics. In Norway, the first student edited law review Jussens Venner was founded in 1952 by students Carsten Smith and Torkel Opsahl (both of whom later became distinguished academics). Occasionally it features peer-reviewed articles, but its editors are composed of one student from the Faculty of Law at the University of Oslo and one student from the Faculty of Law at the University of Bergen. Its articles are mainly related to the curriculum at these universities.  Argentina  In spite of some few exceptions, in Argentina almost all law reviews are run by publishing houses or law professors. In both cases, the involvement of students in the day to day creation of these reviews is fully narrowed. Among these few exceptions, it should be mentioned the case of Revista Lecciones y Ensayos, a law review ran by students of the School of Law of the University of Buenos Aires.Revista Lecciones y Ensayos website of the University of Buenos Aires School of Law.  Australia  In Australia, the leading student-edited peer-reviewed academic law reviews are the Melbourne University Law Review, Sydney Law Review, Federal Law Review, Monash University Law Review and UNSW Law Journal. The Melbourne University Law Review regularly outperforms Sydney Law Review on impact, citation in journal and cases and combined rankings. These publications are among the most-cited law reviews by the High Court of Australia and among the most cited non-US reviews by US journals. The top international law journal in Australia is the Melbourne Journal of International Law, also a student-edited peer-reviewed academic law review.  Brazil  In Brazil, law reviews are usually run by academics as well, but there are efforts by students to change this; for example: University of Brasilia Law Students Review (re-established in 2007), the Review of the Academic Center Afonso Pena from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (published since 1996), and the Alethes Periodic from Federal University of Juiz de Fora. However, academics and official rankings usually refuse to evaluate student law reviews as \\"equals\\". To pursue academic recognition by the Brazilian Ministry of Education, review bodies must include post-graduated and ranked academics, which prevents student law reviews to even be recognized or compared to other similar legal periodicals.  China  In China, there are law reviews run by academics, as well as law reviews run by students. The China Law Journal is an attempt to create a legal publication, that is produced from all groups related to law, including lawyers, academics, students, members of the judiciary, procurators and anyone else in related fields with an interest in China.  India  Among academic law journals in India, the Journal of Indian Law Institute and the Delhi Law Review published by the Faculty of Law, University of Delhi since 1972 are most prominent and respected among Indian legal scholars and academicians. National Law Schools/Universities are now leading the law review publication field, with notable reviews being the NALSAR Student Law Review and the National Law School of India Review and lawbright, eJournal.  Mexico  The Mexican Law Review, the law review of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico's preeminent university, is edited by professors and is therefore a closer cousin to peer-reviewed social science journals than to typical student-run law journals.  Online legal research providers  Online legal research providers such as Westlaw and LexisNexis give users access to the complete text of most law reviews published beginning from the late 1980s. Another such service, Heinonline, provides actual scans of the pages of law reviews going back to the 1850s. Student activity Membership on the law review staff is highly sought after by some law students, as it often has a significant impact on their subsequent careers as attorneys. Many U.S. federal judges and partners at the most prestigious law firms were members or editors of their school's law review. There are a number of reasons why journal membership is desired by some students: * Some see the intense writing, research and editing experience as invaluable to the student's development as an attorney; * Others see the selection process as helping differentiate the best and the brightest from an already strong group of law students. At schools with more than one law review, membership on the main or flagship journal is normally considered more prestigious than membership on a specialty law journal. This is not the case at all schools, however. At many schools, the more prestigious journal is the specialty journal; a low-ranked general journal will rarely attract as much attention as a category-leading specialized journal. Often the best indicator is the age of the journal; a newer journal will rarely have the same clout with employers that the older journal has, even when the older journal is specialized. In any case, membership on any such journal is a valuable credential when searching out employment after law school. The paths to membership vary from law school to law school, and also from journal to journal, but generally contain a few of the same basic elements. Most law reviews select members after their first year of studies either through a writing competition (often referred to as \\"writing on\\" to the law review), their first-year grades (referred to as \\"grading on\\" to the law review) or some combination thereof.Wes Henricksen, Making Law Review: The Expert's Guide to Mastering the Write-On Competition (2008). Most Canadian law reviews, however, do not take grades into considerations and cannot be submitted with the application. A number of schools will also grant membership to students who independently submit a publishable article. The write-on competition usually requires applicants to compose a written analysis of a specific legal topic, often a recent Supreme Court decision. The written submissions are often of a set length, and applicants are sometimes provided with some or all of the background research. Submissions normally are graded blindly, with submissions identified only by a number which the graders will not be able to connect to a particular applicant. A student who has been selected for law review membership is said to have \\"made the law review.\\" Secondary journals vary widely in their membership process. For example, at Yale Law School, the only one of its nine journals that has a competitive membership process is the flagship Yale Law Journal ‚Äì all others are open to any Yale Law student who wishes to join. By contrast, other secondary journals may have their own separate membership competition, or may hold a joint competition with the main law review. A law review's membership is normally divided into staff members and editors. On most law reviews, all 2Ls (second-year students) are staff members while some or all 3Ls (third-year students) serve as editors. 3Ls also typically fill the senior editorial staff positions, including senior articles editor, senior note & comment editor, senior managing editor, and, the most prestigious of all, editor-in-chief of the law review. (Upon graduation, the editor-in-chief of the law review can often expect to be highly recruited by the most prestigious law firms.) As members, students are normally expected to edit and cite-check the articles that are being published by the law review, ensuring that references support what the author claims they support and that footnotes are in proper Bluebook format, depending on the publication's preference. On some law reviews, students may be expected to write a note or comment of publishable quality (although it need not actually be published), although other law reviews often pull from a broader pool for submissions. The editorial staff is normally responsible for reviewing and selecting articles for publication, managing the editing process, and assisting members in writing their notes and comments. Depending on the law school, students may receive academic credit for their work on the law review, although some journals are entirely extracurricular. History of law reviews=United States English and US law education in the early 19th century was dominated by the study of \\"discursive\\" treatises which examined older English case law. These treaties were written by eminent scholars of the era, but had diminishing relevance to a newly founded nation. The treatise format was also unsuited to communicate the rapid decisions of a young court system to an expanding population of lawyers. By the 1850s a number of legal periodicals had arisen in the US which \\"typically highlighted recent court decisions, local news, and editorial comments.\\" One of these periodicals, the American Law Register, was founded in 1852 and has been published continually since. Now known as the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, it is the oldest surviving law review in the US. By the 1870s, these early commercial legal periodicals established the format for a more \\"modern style of legal writing\\" and led to today's student-edited law reviews. The first student-edited law periodical in the US was the Albany Law School Journal, founded in 1875. This journal, described as something like a \\"legal newspaper\\", folded after just one year. Its spiritual successor, the current Albany Law Review was later published in 1936. The Columbia Jurist was created by students in 1885, but ceased publication in 1887. Despite its short lifespan, the Jurist is credited with inspiring creation of the Harvard Law Review, first published in 1887. The current Columbia Law Review, was founded in 1901. The success of the Harvard Law Review provided a model that was followed by later journals: faculty-written articles solicited and published by student editors. Yale Law Journal, first published in 1891, used this format to great success. Other contemporary journals were launched by faculty with varying degrees of student input including Dickinson Law Review in 1897. The West Virginia Bar, a publication by the state Bar Association started in 1894. In 1917, editorship was taken over by the West Virginia College of Law and became the West Virginia Law Review in 1949. The first law review originating outside the Northeast was the Michigan Law Review, beginning in 1902. Northwestern University Law Review followed shortly thereafter in 1906. Both Michigan and Northwestern were launched by faculty and only later turned over to student editors. Following these publications, there was a lull in new journals broken in 1908 by publication of the Maine Law Review which unfortunately ceased publication when the school closed in 1920. The California Law Review, beginning in 1912, was the nation's first law review published west of Illinois. The Georgetown Law Journal was launched that same year.

The stream through the village, often dry in summer, flows some two miles (3 km) south to join the River Nadder. The Fonthill estate extends into the west of the parish as far as Ridge. History Roman artefacts have been found in the nearby quarries, and Purbeck limestone, possibly from Chilmark, was used in the construction of Roman mansions at the villages of West Grimstead and Rockbourne Villa.Sawyer, R., Nadder, 2006, p.84, The Hobnob Press, There was probably a church at Chilmark in the 12th century. Chilmark Manor, a house near the church, is a 17th-century building with 18th-century alterations.  Religious sites  St Margaret of Antioch Dedicated to St. Margaret of Antioch, Chilmark's Anglican parish church dates from the 13th century, with additions in the 14th and 18th centuries. It was most recently restored in 1856 by T.H. Wyatt. The steepled tower, rebuilt in about 1770, retains 13th- century lancet windows. The font has an original 13th-century bowl on a 19th- century base. The church contains several stained-glass windows from the 19th century, and in 1966 was designated as Grade II* listed. The churchyard has Grade II listed chest tombs from the 17th and 18th centuries. A small Baptist chapel was built at Ridge sometime between 1851 and 1864, later becoming known as the Union chapel. By 2003 the building was in private hands.  Chilmark Ravine  About a mile south of the village, the stream passes (together with a minor road) through a ravine, as it descends into the Nadder valley. Stone was quarried here from medieval times, and in the 20th century the ravine was the site of defence establishments. The western half of this area is in Teffont civil parish.  Quarries  Chilmark stone, a form of limestone, was quarried here and used for buildings including Salisbury Cathedral. Stone extraction continued on a small scale until the quarry closed c. 2007. Similar stone is still mined at Chicksgrove Quarry, to the southwest. The former quarries have been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (biological and geological), and as a European Special Area of Conservation for their bat population.  RAF Chilmark  In 1936 the quarries, and land extending further down the ravine, were bought by the Air Ministry and the site became RAF Chilmark, which was the home of No. 11 Maintenance Unit RAF. Munitions were stored in the quarry caverns, and for a time the unit had extensive above-ground storage areas in woodland near Dinton and in Grovely Wood. A spur left the London-Exeter railway west of station at Ham Cross, just east of the bridge over the Chicksgrove-Fovant road, and entered the foot of the ravine; this spur was omitted from Ordnance Survey maps. Goods were transhipped under cover of a large shed, to/from a 2 ft gauge narrow-gauge railway which ran into the ravine and some of the former quarry caverns. By 1965, Chilmark was the RAF's only ammunition supply depot. RAF Chilmark closed in 1995, although clearance of explosives from the site continued until at least 1997. A 1939 diesel locomotive used at the site was bought in 1976 by the Bala Lake Railway, North Wales; several wagons are at the Old Kiln Light Railway, Surrey. = Present = Former RAF Headquarters A Planning Brief prepared by Salisbury District Council in 1999 concluded that options for re- use of the site, except for the former headquarters buildings, were limited owing to the presence of bat colonies and the possibility of contamination remaining from the storage of munitions. Until 2015, the former RAF headquarters and some of land in and near the ravine were used by a private company as a training area for counter-terrorism security and explosives handling.  Civil defence bunker  An underground bunker was built in the ravine in 1985, ready to act as the Regional Government Headquarters (RGHQ) for the southwest region in the event of a nuclear attack. It ceased to be operational in 1992, following the end of the Cold War, and was sold in 1997. During the night of 22 February 2017, officers from Wiltshire Police raided the bunker following information received that it had been converted for use as a cannabis farm. There are approximately 20 rooms in the building, split over two floors, each 200 feet long and 70 feet wide. Almost every room had been converted for the wholesale production of cannabis plants, and there was a large amount of evidence of previous crops. The farm was estimated to be able to produce ¬£2m worth of cannabis per year using ¬£250,000 worth of stolen electricity, with a crop of 4,000 plants every six weeks. The lighting equipment alone was estimated to have cost about ¬£140,000. Three men admitted conspiracy to produce class B drugs and abstracting electricity. Charges of conspiracy to hold persons in slavery or servitude were initially made, but dropped due to lack of evidence. It took ten days to search and clear the site, which was said to be the biggest cannabis factory found in the southwest region. Custodial sentences were imposed on the three men in August 2017.  Namesakes  Two settlements in the United States bear the same name. Chilmark, Massachusetts, on the island of Martha's Vineyard, was named in 1694 in connection with Governor Thomas Mayhew, who emigrated from nearby Tisbury and founded a colony on the island. In 1930, V. Everit Macy, an industrialist, established a suburb of Briarcliff Manor, New York and named it Chilmark after the home village of his ancestor Thomas Macy, who emigrated in 1635.  Amenities  The village has a primary school, Chilmark and Fonthill Bishop CofE (VA) Primary School. The building began as a National School, built in Chilmark stone in 1860. In 1971 Chilmark school merged with Fonthill Bishop school; the building at Fontwell Bishop was closed and the accommodation at Chilmark extended. The Reading Room of 1910 is now the village hall. The village has a pub, the Black Dog Inn.  Notable residents  John Wilcox (1931‚Äì2018), author of the Simon Fonthill series of 12 novels and four other books lived in Chilmark. Thomas Macy, an early settler of Amesbury, Massachusetts and Nantucket Island, was born in the town.

The story was later published in a collection of Nakazawa's short stories by Holp Shuppan. I Saw It is an autobiographical piece following the life of Nakazawa from his youngest days in post-war Hiroshima, up until his adulthood. I Saw It became the predecessor for Nakazawa's popular manga series Barefoot Gen. The volume was released in North American in a colorized English translated volume by Educomics under the title I Saw It: The Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima: A Survivor's True Story in 1982.  Plot  In 1945, elementary student Keiji Nakazawa's mother wakes him up during an air raid and they rush into a wet shelter. Hungry and with there being little food, Keiji would steal and eat raw rice from storage bins. To earn money, the family painted wooden clogs. His father also did traditional Japanese paintings and his brother Yasuto welded the hulls of ships at the Kure Shipyard. Keiji's brother, Shoji, left during a group evacuation, keeping in touch through letters. On August 6, 1945, on his way to school, Keiji saw a B-29 flying overhead. At 8:15 am, it dropped an atomic bomb, nicknamed Little Boy, on Hiroshima. Keiji was knocked unconscious. The schoolyard wall had blocked most of the flames from the blast, though his cheek was impaled by a nail in a wooden board. Keiji returned to his home to learn that his mother, who had recently given birth to a baby girl, was waiting for him by the tracks on Yamaguchi Street. The rest of his family, except Yasuto, had just died. Their house had collapsed in the blast, and the father and children were trapped under the wreckage. Meanwhile, a fire had started elsewhere, but quickly spread from house to house, so the father and children were burned alive while pinned down, and while the mother listened to their screams. Later on, Keiji and Yasuto went back to their home to dig up their family's bodies. On August 15, 1945, World War II ended and Shoji returned. The baby girl his mother gave birth to on the day of the bombing died and was cremated on the beach. Keiji returned to school and houses being rebuilt. His family was poor, and Keiji was always hunting for food. He also began collecting trash and glass to turn into items he could sell. One day, he found a copy of the manga Shin-Takarajima (New Treasure Island) by Osamu Tezuka. Inspired, he started writing his own manga and reading manga magazines at the local bookstores. Keiji submitted one of his manga creations to the magazine Omoshiro Book which accepted and published it. Wanting to improve his drawing skills, Keiji began working as a sign painter for a former war veteran. A second manuscript sent to Omoshiro Book won him second place in a contest. Keiji used the prize money to buy a palette. One New Year's Eve, Keiji's mother Kimiyo began hemorrhaging. He purchased all the medicine he could, wanting to give her some good memories, and she slowly regained her health. Keiji moved to Tokyo to begin his career as a manga artist. Keiji's editor got him a job working as the assistant to Daiji Kazumine. One and a half years later, his manga titles began serialization in various magazines. When he returned to Hiroshima to meet his mother, she had recovered though she was unable to walk freely. She collected every issue of the magazines his works appeared in, and Keiji told her to get well so he can show her Tokyo. Returning to Tokyo, Keiji met a woman who he fell in love with and married. Meeting Keiji's wife, Kimiyo told him that her life was now complete. She died while Keiji and his wife were en route to Tokyo. When they cremated her body, the radiation remaining in her from the bomb caused her bones to disintegrate, leaving only white dust instead of the usual ashes. Traumatized and angered, Keiji decided he would fight the atomic bomb through his manga's. Five years have passed since Kimiyo died. Keiji is standing by a pond and wishing he had been born in a better time. Checking the time, he realizes it's close to the deadline for his work for Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. He goes back into the house to get down to work.  Media  I Saw It premiered as a one-shot work in a September 30, 1972 special issue of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, entitled Monthly Sh≈çnen Jump featuring manga based on various creators' biographies. Monthly Sh≈çnen Jump later split into its own manga anthology. Nakazawa's editor later urged him to write a longer series based on I Saw It, which became the series Barefoot Gen. I Saw It was later published as a part of a compilation of Nakazawa's short stories by Holp Shuppan, entitled . The company Educomics discontinued their licence to Barefoot Gen, in order to start their translation on the I Saw It manga. It was published in a single volume under the title I Saw It: The Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima: A Survivor's True Story. Educomics colorized the series and offered lesson plans for bulk orders to aid in using the series in classrooms to help explain the war to students. Also with bulk orders an 11 √ó 17 inch free poster was added for promoting the manga in stores, with endorsements by other manga artists and peace educators. I Saw It was later included as the first story in The Mammoth Book of Best War Comics, published by Constable & Robinson.  Reception  I Saw It (in the context of the story's inclusion in The Mammoth Book of Best War Comics) was reviewed by \\"Brick\\" for ComicsVillage.com: \\"Nakazawa‚Äôs short story is infinitely more powerful for its portrayal of the sacrifices his mother makes so that Keiji can become a cartoonist.\\" David Kendall of The List also reviewed I Saw It: \\"Keiji Nakazawa sets the mood with his personal account of the bombing of Hiroshima in I Saw It, a poignant tale that spells out the human cost of the atomic bomb and the implications that resonate throughout the rest of their lives.\\"  References Further reading *  External links  * Autobiographical anime and manga Novels about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Historical anime and manga Novels by Keiji Nakazawa 1972 manga Sh≈çnen manga Shueisha manga ","title":"I Saw It"},{"id":"18648256","text":"Pablo Andr√©s Vranjic√°n Storani (born 11 December 1985) is an Argentine footballer who currently plays for Deportes La Serena.

The first plans for a building named for Hendrik Hudson on Riverside Drive were announced in October 1897 by Eugene Kirby, a former manager of the Marie Antoinette Hotel. This was to be an 18-story hotel.\\"Hotel On Riverside Drive\\", The New York Times, October 22, 1897, pg. 12, accessed March 25, 2009 These plans were never completed, however, and by 1907, an apartment building bearing the name had been constructed instead. History In order to take advantage of the New York City Subway's newly opened line in the area, developers George F Johnson and Aleck Kahn purchased three-quarters of the block defined by Riverside Drive, Broadway, West 110th Street and 111th Street in order to build an apartment complex. The architectural firm of Rouse & Sloan was hired to design and construct the building. The project was led by William L Rouse, and the result was an eight story building modeled after a Tuscan Villa, containing 72 apartment units. The building also featured two towers, on the north and south sides, connected by a promenade. The apartments officially opened on October 1, 1907, and the units were quickly rented. Due to this success, a 12 story annex, also designed by William Rouse, was constructed. The apartment building continued to enjoy success for several decades, until the aftermath of the 1943 rent-control law caused it to rapidly deteriorate. The current landlords of the building were brought to court in 1958 due to the slum-like conditions of the building, and were sentenced to a 30-day jail term. This, along with the investigation of the accidental death of a small child in the building, prompted renovations to be carried out in 1959. In 1971, the Hendrik Hudson became a co-op, and the north tower was removed. In 1996, the decision was made to preserve the deteriorating south tower as a \\"stabilized ruin\\", despite its preservation costing more than demolishing it.

In 2005, he founded Voltage Pictures, the Los Angeles-based international financing, sales and production company.  Early life  Chartier, during his time as a Disneyland Paris janitor, sold his first screenplay which allowed him to buy a one-way ticket to Los Angeles. In order too scrape together a living, Chartier wrote soft-core porn for cable TV. From there, he moved on to hold various executive level sales and acquisitions roles. He championed the sale of film My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Academy Award-winning film Crash directed by Paul Haggis. Later on, he founded Voltage Pictures where his breakthrough film \\"The Hurt Locker\\" allowed him to produce other successful films. Career= Film  The Hurt Locker was Voltage's first in-house production and won six Academy Awards in 2009, including Best Picture. Killer Joe was Voltage's second production, directed by William Friedkin and starring Matthew McConaughey. In 2013, Nicolas executive produced Dallas Buyers Club, for which Matthew McConaughey won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Jared Leto for Best Supporting Actor. He also produced The Company You Keep, directed by Robert Redford and starring Robert Redford and Shia LaBeouf, The Zero Theorem directed by Terry Gilliam, starring Christoph Waltz; Don Jon, directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, starring Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore; Good Kill, directed by Andrew Niccol, starring Ethan Hawke; Fathers and Daughters, starring Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, and Aaron Paul; I.T. directed by John Moore starring Pierce Brosnan and is an executive producer on A Tale of Love and Darkness, written, directed by and starring Natalie Portman and was an official selection at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. Other movies include I Feel Pretty starring Amy Schumer and Michelle Williams, which grossed nearly $100 million worldwide; Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile starring Zac Efron and Lily Collins, which premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film festival; After starring Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes-Tiffin and based on the worldwide best-seller from Anna Todd, and Ava starring Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrell, John Malkovich, Common and Geena Davis, which is currently in post-production. Previous films produced by Chartier also include Colossal written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo starring Anne Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis and A Family Man directed by Mark Williams starring Gerard Butler which both premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. He was also executive producer on Taylor Sheridan‚Äôs directorial debut Wind River, starring Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, which premiered to rave reviews at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival which took over $44 million in worldwide box office.  The Hurt Locker  Nicolas Chartier is best known for his work in financing \\"The Hurt Locker\\" directed by Kathryn Bigelow Starring Jeremy Renner. The film has won many awards including an Oscar and an Academy Award. In 2006, \\"The Hurt Locker\\" script is circulated by CAA to foreign sales companies in hopes of getting picked up and financed. Chartier, who owns Voltage Pictures, calls CAA to speak more in detail about the film as well as wanting to help produce it. The film asked for US$20 million, which Chartier points out as too high of a budget. An Iraqi war drama with no notable stars attached, would unlikely receive any reasonable funding from skeptical foreign buyers. The budget was inevitably lowered by 35%, down to US$13 million. In order to acquire proof of finance for a production loan Chartier managed to put together 25-30% of pre-sale loans from various territories like the EU, Asia, and even airline companies. Unable to get the bulk of the production loan in time before pre-production, Chartier put in his own money in order to finance the bulk of the film, going as far as mortgaging his own home. In all, the overall budget for \\"The Hurt Locker\\" was US$15 Million. The film managed to generate US$49.2 Million in the box office. Before the Oscars, the Academy banned Chartier from the ceremony for sending out a mass email to voters to try to convince them to vote for the idie \\"The Hurt Locker\\" rather than James Cameron's big budget US$500 million budget \\"Avatar.\\" In response, according to Deadline Magazine, Chartier threw his own private party. In Chartier's defense, Jeff Steele (CFO of Magnet Media Group) wrote about Chartier on the blogpost The Warp writing, \\"I would say that anybody who can cobble together the financing from pre-sales, gap, bridge, tax credits and equity funding to produce a theatrical feature worthy of consideration for Best Picture is already a winner in my book.\\" Filmography as producer *The Prodigal (producer) *Stowaway (executive producer) *Tenfold (producer) *2020 - Ava (producer) *2019 - After (executive producer) *2019 - The Professor and The Madman (producer) *2019 - BOO!

History Merlin was formed in 1992 by a unique female vocalist and bassist Mary Abaza and one of the best Russian guitarists Alex Ioffe. After a long search, they met Nick Byckoff - the drummer they dreamt of. Before Merlin all of them had a great experience of playing in various styles from hard rock to thrash {1}. The musicians consider the name of their band suitable, because they wanted the name to be original for a death metal band and easy to rememberer for fans, so \\"merlin‚Äù suited the request. Besides they chose Merlin as a symbol of magic power and majesty. Merlin is best known as the warlock featured in Arthurian legends and it is musicians' opinion that he is best of all portrayed in the Stephen King‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Dark Tower‚Äù. Also merlin is a predatory bird that tears meat by its claws, its beak in blood and this absolutely reflects their band's personality. (Incidentally, \\"merlin\\" means from French into English \\"heavy axe\\", \\"large hammer\\", \\"poleaxe\\"). Why Mary Abaza is a unique female vocalist? It's because she has got a unique voice of great compass from contralto (overrides male baritone) to soprano (they say, with this rare and uncommon voice, one can be admitted to the Moscow Conservatory without entrance examinations) and withal she is a brilliant growler and added to everything else, she is one of the first female growling vocalists in the world {2}. She got jazz and some classical educations and as she said herself, it helped her to find her own way of singing death metal applying some jazz tricks; by the way it helps her in creating music. When Mary began singing death metal she was crazy about John Tardy (Obituary) as a vocalist and imitated something from his hysterical manner. Then she added to her voice some black metal high tones and worked on timbre and articulation {3}. Merlin's first demo \\"Welcome to Hell\\" (1992) was played in a Death/Thrash style, but as soon as three months later, they released the second demo, which was more in a Death/Grind direction. However, their third demo \\"Prisoner of Death\\" (1994) became the most well known of all three. It was reviewed in a lot of fan'zines worldwide and got a pretty rapturous appreciation{4}. Since their first live performance in 1992, Merlin has been known as the most aggressive and brutal death metal band from Russia and after their album \\"Deathkoteque\\", which was released in 1997 and became a real bomb, they were called leaders of Russian Death Metal scene. A lot of songs were included in compilations such a ¬´Thrash your mother¬ª, ¬´Deathtalker¬ª, ¬´Russian metal ballads¬ª etc. And also there is the track like ‚ÄúLeave Me Alone‚Äù, which is dedicated to one of the bands that formed the roots of extreme metal like this, namely ‚ÄúBlack Sabbath‚Äù. Erik Rutan (Morbid Angel, Hate Eternal), after listening to this album said that few male vocalists can do the same at a level that is high as Mary's {5}. In September 2000, their second album ¬´They Must Die¬ª had been released by Hobgoblin records (Russia) in MC format and in January 2001 it was re-released on \\"Grind It!\\" records, a division on Great White North Records, Canada, in CD format, for the North-American territory and elsewhere in the world. Later ¬´Deathkoteque¬ª was re-mastered and re- released too at GWN Records. And ¬´They Must Die¬ª had turned out very successful{6}. Merlin wanted to create a conceptual album, very aggressive and brutal and this album contents these requests exactly. It is also more technical and melodic. Plus, Mary experimented a lot more with the vocals on this album. In 1998 they added a second guitarist to the line-up - Arteom \\"Bolt\\" Nazarov (ex - Anal Pus). It turned that Arteom was a very competent guitarist with a brilliant sense of rhythm and infallible memory. Since then, they became to work with two guitarists live. The band conducts concert activity and takes part in all considerable festivals and gigs around Moscow and some other Russian towns and was working on some new material for their up-coming third album \\"Brutal Constructor\\", scheduled to come out in 2003 on GWN. Everything would be perfect, Merlin was about to go on a European tour and at its height of recording the new album, the terrible misfortune had happened... On July 13, 2003 their drummer Nick Byckoff died in a car accident. It is an irreplaceable deprivation for the band, because during they played together Nick became like a brother to them. He was a brilliant drummer and his enormous technique amazed not only the audience, but the musicians, too... He was out of any competition; ‚ÄúThis guy was fast, tight and intense as hell!‚Äù; many idolized him and were quiet right. Musicians still can't believe that it happened and it seems to them that he simply got tired and left for a while. It need to say that it was Nick who imposed on the band that extremely powerful sound which distinguished the band Merlin for all these years and owing to his incredible mastership they achieved those impossible speeds which drive Merlin's fans crazy {7}. That was hard to find a new drummer instead of Nick Byckoff. It seemed almost impossible. But it needed to soldier on. Nevertheless, after trying a lot of challengers they dwelled on Anatoly \\"Alchothron\\" Boychenko and now it's possible to see that they have not been mistaken with the choice. Anatoly is really a very interesting drummer with modern and independent way of thinking. He joined the band once and for all in September 2003. Their album ‚ÄúBrutal Constructor‚Äù was recording hard (May 2003 - January 2004). It was very painful to do something after Nick's death. Mary Abaza: ‚ÄúMy voice vanished, because of nerves, a few times we lost the guitar tracks, besides the engineer got serious problems with health‚Ä¶ kind of some mysticism, ya see.‚Äù But at first they must finish this album ‚ÄúBrutal Constructor‚Äù, moreover Nick Byckoff had time to record all drum parts for this album and it is still possible to hear Nick's magnificent and masterly work, so it was their duty before him to do their best. And they did it. In 2004, Merlin created a real masterpiece - the album \\"Brutal Constructor\\". This album contains 9 killer songs, a cover-version of \\"Zombie Ritual\\" by Death and a number on the music for the Sergei Eisenstein film \\"Alexander Nevsky\\", the cantata ‚ÄúAlexander Nevsky‚Äù (1938) created by genius Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev {8}. The musicians of Merlin were in earnest about their own interpretation of one of the most renowned cantatas of the 20th century, because Mary Abaza loves classical music very much, especially modern such as Dmitri Shostakovich and Alfred Schnittke and German composers such as Ludwig van Beethoven and Anton Bruckner. In general, music is Mary's family tradition. Her mother is professional pianist and Mary herself used to play the piano in the childhood{9}. Among their ancestry, there were great composers. Such the influential composer of 20th century music as Igor Stravinsky was a cousin of her great grandfather. Also the author of a well- known romance \\"–£—Ç—Ä–æ —Ç—É–º–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ\\" [Utro Tumannoe] (‚ÄúFoggy morning‚Äù), Russian pianist, composer of 19th century ‚Äì Arkadiy Maximovich Abaza was her forefather {10}. Thus, the album Brutal Constructor was recorded at Navaho Records during 2003. It was produced by Mary Abaza, Alex Ioffe and Les Disques Great White North enr. Merlin wanted the album to be as brutal as possible: ‚ÄúThe music is in beyond the bounds of engineering capability‚Äù. At the same time they managed to play it in their own Merlin style, extremely fast and intensive. This work appeared a deserving tribute to Nick's memory. Brutal Constructor has been included in \\"European Top 10\\" death metal albums of 2004.{11} And of late years Merlin's line-up changed. Their guitarist Arteom \\"Bolt\\" Nazarov, who had played during six years in the band, quit Merlin, but a short time later (January, 2004) they had already had got a new guitar- player instead of Bolt, Sergey \\"Psycho\\" Chebanov. He played in the band during 2004 - 2006 and in autumn 2006 a new guitarist Michael \\"Dead Head\\" Karpeyev joined the band. Brutal Constructor is Merlin's latest album and it was released by two labels: in Canada by GWN Records, while for Russia and C.I.S. by Cd-Maximum. In 2004 they re-released their first two albums Deathkoteque and They Must Die at Cd-Maximum. Now Merlin work on the future album with a new drummer Vlad \\"Ravendark\\" Vorona and new guitarist Rinat. Also, they have a fresh video material which will be included in a future DVD.

He served on Birmingham General Hospital's Board and that of the Eye Hospital as well as getting involved in the affairs of the Town Council. Cadbury was an abolitionist and in 1840 attended the World's Anti-Slavery Convention at Freemasons' Hall, London.

During the twelve years of his administration, the Republic of Madagascar experienced institutional stability that stood in contrast to the political turmoil many mainland African countries experienced in this period. This stability contributed to Tsiranana's popularity and his reputation as a remarkable statesman. Madagascar experienced moderate economic growth under his social democrat policies and came to be known as \\"the Happy Island.\\" However, the electoral process was fraught with issues and his term ultimately terminated in a series of farmer and student protests that brought about the end of the First Republic and the establishment of the officially socialist Second Republic. The \\"benevolent schoolmaster\\" public image that Tsiranana cultivated, went alongside a firmness of convictions and actions that some believe tended toward authoritarianism. Nonetheless, he remains an esteemed Malagasy political figure remembered throughout the country as its \\"Father of Independence.\\"  Early life (1910‚Äì1955) =From cattle herder to teacher An example of cattle ranchers in Madagascar.

However, following the death of his father in 1923, Tsiranana's brother, Zamanisambo, suggested that he attend a primary school in Anjiamangirana.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.14 A brilliant student, Tsiranana was admitted into the Analalava regional school in 1926, where he graduated with a brevet des coll√®ges.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.15 In 1930, he enrolled in the Le Myre de Vilers normal school in Tananarive, named after former resident-general of Madagascar Charles Le Myre de Vilers, where he entered the \\"Section Normale\\" program, preparing him for a career teaching in primary schools. After completing his studies, he started a teaching career in his hometown. In 1942, he began receiving instruction in Tananarive for middle school teaching and in 1945, he succeeded in the teacher assistant competitive examinations, allowing him to serve as a professor in a regional school. In 1946, he obtained a scholarship to the √âcole normale d'instituteurs in Montpellier, France, where he worked as a teacher assistant. He left Madagascar on 6 November.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.17 From communism to PADESM In 1943, Philibert Tsiranana joined the professional teachers' union and in 1944 entered the General Confederation of Labor (CGT). With the end of World War II and the creation of the French Union by the Fourth Republic, the colonial society of Madagascar experienced a liberalization. The colonized peoples now had the right to be politically organized. Tsiranana joined the Group of Student Communists (GEC) of Madagascar in January 1946, on the advice of his mentor Paul Ralaivoavy. He assumed the role of treasurer. The GEC enabled him to meet future leaders of the PADESM (Party of the Disinherited of Madagascar), which he became a founding member of in June 1946. The PADESM was a political organization composed mainly of and from the coastal region. The PADESM came about as a result of the holding of the French constituent elections of 1945 and 1946. For the first time, the people of Madagascar were allowed to participate in French elections, with electing settlers and indigenous people to the French National Assembly. To ensure that they won one of the two seats allotted to native people of Madagascar, the inhabitants of the coastal region made an agreement with the Mouvement d√©mocratique de la r√©novation malgache (MDRM) which was controlled by the Merina of the uplands.In the precolonial period, the Malagasy aristocracy had been almost entirely composed of the Merina. The coastal people agreed to seek the election of Paul Ralaivoavy in the west, while leaving the east to the Merina candidate, Joseph Ravoahangy.Assembl√©e nationale - Les d√©put√©s de la IVe R√©publique : Joseph Ravoahangy This agreement was not honoured and the Merina won the second seat in October 1945 and June 1946. Concerned about the possible return of \\"Merina control,\\" the coastal people founded PADESM in order to counter the nationalist goals of the MDRM and oppose Malagasy independence - a position justified by Tsiranana in 1968: In July 1946, Tsiranana refused the post of secretary general of PADESM on account of his impending departure for the √âcole normale de Montpellier. Tsiranana had become known for his contributions to PADESM's journal Voromahery,Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.16 authored under the pseudonym \\"Tsimihety\\" (derived from his birthplace).  Period in France  The place de la Com√©die, Montpellier. As a result of his journey to France, Tsiranana escaped the Malagasy Uprising of 1947 and its bloody suppression. Moved by the events, Tsiranana participated in an anti-colonial protest in Montpellier on 21 February 1949, although not a supporter of independence. During his time in France, Tsiranana became conscious of the bias towards the Malagasy elite in education. He found that only 17 of the 198 Malagasy students in France were coastal people. In his view, there could never be a free union between all Malagasy while a cultural gap remained between the coastal people and the people of the highlands. To remedy this gap, he established two organisations in Madagascar: the Association of Coastal Malagasy Students (AEMC) in August 1949, and then the Cultural Association of Coastal Malagasy Intellectuals (ACIMCO) in September 1951. These organisations were resented by the Merina and were held against him. On his return to Madagascar in 1950, Tsiranana was appointed professor of technical education at the √âcole industrielle in Tananarive in the highlands. There he taught French and mathematics. But he was uncomfortable at this school and transferred to the √âcole ¬´ Le Myre de Vilers ¬ª, where his abilities were more appreciated.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.18  Progressivist ambitions  Council of the Republic from 1948 to 1959 Renewing his activities with PADESM, Tsiranana campaigned to reform the left wing of the party. He considered the directorial committee very disloyal to the administration. In article published on 24 April 1951 in Varomahery, entitled \\"Mba Hiraisantsika\\" (To unite us), he called for reconciliation between the coastal people and the Merina in advance of the forthcoming legislative elections.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.20 In October he launched an appeal in the bimonthly Ny Antsika (\\"Our thing\\") which he had founded, an appeal to the Malagasy elites to \\"form a single tribe\\". This appeal to unity concealed a political plan: Tsiranana aspired to take part in the 1951 legislative elections as a candidate for the west coast.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.21 The tactic failed because far from creating agreement, it led to suspicion among the coastal political class that he was a communist, and he was forced to renounce his candidature in favour of the \\"moderate\\" Raveloson- Mahasampo.Assembl√©e nationale - Les d√©put√©s de la IVe R√©publique : Raveloson- Mahasampo On 30 March 1952, Tsiranana was elected provincial counsellor for the 3rd district of Majunga on the \\"Social Progress\\" list. He combined this role with that of Counsellor on the Representative Assembly of Madagascar. Seeking a position in the French government, he offered himself as a candidate in the elections organised by the Territorial Assembly of Madagascar in May 1952 for the five senators of the Council of the Republic. Since two of these seats were reserved for French citizens,The participation of the French colonies in the French parliament was introduced in 1945. In order to ensure the representation of natives and colonists, elections were conducted by a \\"double electoral college.\\" In this system, each of the colleges woted for its own candidates. The native college was the college of the \\"Citizens of the French Union\\", also called the \\"College of the natives\\" or the \\"second college\\". Initially, citizenship of the French Union was granted to natives on the basis of their status as chiefs, veterans, officials, etc. Citizens of France were also granted citizenship of the French Union and could vote either in the college reserved for them or in the second college. Tsiranana was only allowed to stand for one of the three seats reserved for native people. He was beaten by Pierre Ramampy, Norbert Zafimahova,Anciens s√©nateurs de la IVe R√©publique : Norbert Zafimahova and Ralijaona Laingo.Anciens s√©nateurs de la IVe R√©publique : Ralijaona Laingo Effected by this defeat, Tsiranana accused the administration of \\"racial discrimination.\\" Along with other native counsellors, he proposed the establishment of a single electoral college to French Prime Minister Pierre Mend√®s France.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.22 In the same year, Tsiranana joined the new Malagasy Action, a \\"third party between radical nationalists and supporters of the status quo,\\" which sought to establish social harmony through equality and justice.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.19 Tsiranana hoped to establish a national profile for himself and transcend the coastal and regional character of PADESM, especially since he no longer supported Madagascar simply being a free state of the French Union, but sought full independence from France.  Rise to Power (1956‚Äì1958) = Malagasy Deputy in the French National Assembly  The Palais Bourbon, seat of the French National Assembly In 1955, while visiting France on administrative live, Tsiranana joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), in advance of the January 1956 elections for seats in the French National Assembly. During his electoral campaign, Tsiranana was able to count on the support of the Malagasy National Front (FNM), led by Merina who had left Malagasy Action, and especially on the support of the High Commissioner Andr√© Soucadaux, who saw Tsiranana as the most reasonable of the nationalists seeking election. Thanks to this support and the following which he had built up over the previous five years,Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.23 Tsiranana was successfully elected as deputy for the western region, with 253,094 of the 330,915 votes. In the Palais Bourbon, Tsiranana joined the socialist group. He rapidly gained a reputation as a frank talker; in March 1956, he affirmed the dissatisfaction of the Malagasy with the French Union which he characterised as simply a continuation of savage colonialism: \\"All this is just a facade - the foundation remains the same.\\" On arrival, he demanded the repeal of the annexation law of August 1896. Finally, in July 1956, he called for reconciliation, demanding the release of all prisoners from the 1947 insurrection. By combining calls for friendship with France, political independence and national unity, Tsiranana acquired a national profile. His position as deputy also gave him the opportunity to demonstrate his local political interests. Through his stress on equality, he obtained a majority in the Malagasy Territorial Assembly for his personal bastion in the north and northwest. In addition, he worked energetically in favour of decentralisation - ostensibly in order to improve economic and social services. As a result, he received harsh criticism from some members of the French Communist Party (PCF) who were allied to ardent nationalists in Tananarive and accused him of seeking to \\"Balkanise\\" Madagascar. Tsiranana developed a firm anti-communist attitude as a result. This support for private property led him to submit his only bill of law on 20 February 1957, proposing \\"increased penalties for cattle thieves,\\" which the French penal code did not take into account.  Creation of PSD and the Loi Cadre Defferre  Tsiranana increasingly made himself the leader of the coastal people. On 28 December 1956, he founded the Social Democratic Party (PSD) at Majunga with people from the left wing of PADESM, including Andr√© Resampa. The new party was affiliated to the SFIO.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.31 The PSD was more or less the heir of PADESM, but rapidly exceeded PADESM's limits, since it simultaneously appealed to rural nobles on the coast, officials, and anti- communists in favour of independence. From the beginning, his party benefitted from the support of the colonial administration, which was in the process of transferring executive power in accordance with the Loi Cadre Defferre. The entry into force of the Loi Cadre was expected to take place after the 1957 territorial elections. On 31 March, Tsiranana was re-elected as a provincial counsellor on the \\"Union and Social Progress\\" list with 79,991 votes out of 82,121.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.32 Since he was head of the list, he was named president of the Majunga Provincial Assembly on 10 April 1957. On 27 March, this assembly selected an executive council. Tsiranana's PSD had only nine seats in the representative assembly. A coalition government was formed with Tsiranana at its head as vice-president and the High Commissioner Andr√© Soucadaux as president de jure.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.33 Tsiranana succeeded in getting his closest supporter, Andr√© Resampa, appointed as minister of education. Once in power, Tsiranana slowly consolidated his authority. On 12 June 1957, a second section of PSD was founded in Toliara province. Sixteen counsellors of the provincial assembly joined it and the PSD thus took control of Toliara.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.34 Like most African politicians in power in the French Union, Tsiranana publicly complained about the limitations on his power as vice-president of the council.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.36 In April 1958, during the 3rd PSD party congress, Tsiranana attacked the Loi Cadre and the bicephalous character which it imposed on the council and the fact that the presidency of the Malagasy government was held by the high commissioner.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.37 The assumption of power by Charles de Gaulle in June 1958 changed the situation. By a national government ordinance, the hierarchy of the colonial territories was modified in favour of local politicians.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.44 Thus, on 22 August 1958, Tsiranana officially became the President of the Executive Council of Madagascar.  Malagasy Republic within the French Community (1958‚Äì1960) = Promotion of the Franco-African Community  L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, deputy for Senegal (1946-1959) Despite this activity, Tsiranana was more a supporter of strong autonomy rather than independence. He advocated a very moderate nationalism: : On his return to power in 1958, Charles de Gaulle decided to accelerate the process of decolonisation. The French Union was to be replaced by a new organisation.Jean-Marcel Champion, ¬´ Communaut√© fran√ßaise ¬ª in Encyclop√©die Universalis, 2002 edition. De Gaulle appointed a consultative committee, including many African and Malagasy politicians, on 23 July 1958. Its discussion concentrated essentially on the nature of the links between France and her former colonies. The Ivoirien F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny proposed the establishment of a Franco-African \\"Federation,\\" while L√©opold S√©dar Senghor of Senegal pushed for a \\"confederation.\\" In the end the concept of \\"community\\", suggested to Tsiranana by Raymond Janot, one of the editors of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, which was chosen.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.64 Naturally, Tsiranana actively campaigned, along with the Union of Social Democrats of Madagascar (UDSM) led by senator Norbert Zafimahova, for the \\"yes\\" vote in the referendum on whether Madagascar should join the French Community, which was held on 28 September 1958.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.48 The \\"no\\" campaign was led by the Union of Malagasy Peoples (UPM). The \\"yes\\" vote won with 1,361,801 votes, compared to 391,166 votes for \\"no\\". On the basis of this vote, Tsiranana secured the repeal of the annexation law of 1896. On 14 October 1958, during a meeting of the provincial counsellors, Tsiranana proclaimed the autonomous Malagasy Republic, of which he became the provisional prime minister.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.50 The next day, the annexation law of 1896 was repealed.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.51  Political manoeuvres against the opposition  On 16 October 1958, the congress elected a national assembly of 90 members for drafting a constitution, by means of a majority general ballot for each province.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.52 This method of election ensured that PSD and UDSM would not face any opposition in the assembly from the parties which campaigned for a \\"no\\" vote in the referendum. Norbert Zafimahova was chosen as president of the assembly. In reaction to the creation of this assembly, the UPM, FNM and the Association of Peasants' Friends merged to form a single party, the Congress Party for the Independence of Madagascar (AKFM), led by the priest Richard Andriamanjato, on 19 October.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.54 This party was Marxist and became the principal opposition to the government. Tsiranana rapidly instituted state infrastructure in the provinces which enabled him to contain AKFM. In particular, he appointed secretaries of state in all the provinces. Then, on 27 January, he dissolved the municipal council of Diego Suarez, which was controlled by the Marxists. Finally, on 27 February 1959, he passed a law introducing the \\"offense of contempt for national and communal institutions\\" and used this to sanction certain publications.  Election as President of the Malagasy Republic  On 29 April 1959, the constitutional assembly accepted the constitution proposed by the government.Patrick Rajoelina. Quarante ann√©es de la vie politique de Madagascar 1947-1987. √âditions L‚ÄôHarmattan. 1988. p.25 It was largely modelled on the Constitution of France, but with some unique characteristics.Charles Cadoux. Madagascar. In Encyclop√©die Universalis. 2002 Edition. The Head of State was the Head of Government and held all executive power; the vice- president had only a very minor role. The legislature was to be bicameral, unusually for Francophone African countries of that time. The provinces, with their own provincial councils, had a degree of autonomy. On the whole the government structure was that of a moderate presidential system, rather than a parliamentary one. On 1 May, the parliament elected a college consisting of provincial counsellors and an equal number of delegates from communities, which was to select the first President of the Republic.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.57 Four candidates were nominated: Philibert Tsiranana, Basile Razafindrakoto, Prosper Rajoelson and Maurice Curmer. In the end, Tsiranana was unanimously elected as the first president of the Malagasy Republic with 113 votes (and one abstention). Philibert Tsiranana and Michel Debr√© signing agreements on the independence of the Malagasy Republic On 24 July 1959, Charles de Gaulle appointed four responsible African politicians, of whom Tsiranana was one, to the position of \\"Minister-Counsellor\\" of the French government for the affairs of the French Community.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.63 Tsiranana used his new powers to call for national sovereignty for Madagascar; de Gaulle accepted this.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.67 In February 1960, a Malagasy delegation led by Andr√© ResampaAndr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.84 was sent to Paris to negotiate the transfer of power.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.74 Tsiranana insisted that all Malagasy organisations should be represented in this delegation, except for AKFM (which he deplored).Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.75 On 2 April 1960, the Franco- Malagasy accords were signed by Prime Minister Michel Debr√© and President Tsiranana at the H√¥tel Matignon.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.88 On 14 June, the Malagasy parliament unanimously accepted the accords.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.101 On 26 June, Madagascar became independent.  The \\"state of grace\\" (1960‚Äì1967)  Tsiranana sought to establish national unity through a policy of stability and moderation. In order to legitimise his image as the \\"father of independence\\", on 20 July 1960, Tsiranana recalled to the island the three old deputies, \\"exiled\\" to France after the 1947 rebellion: Joseph Ravoahangy, and Jacques Rabemananjara.Patrick Rajoelina. op. cit. p.31 The popular and political impact was significant.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.106 The President invited these \\"Heroes of 1947\\" to enter his second government on 10 October 1960; Joseph Ravoahangy became Minister of Health and Jacques Rabemananjara became Minister of the Economy.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.116 Joseph Raseta, by contrast, refused the offer and joined AFKM instead.Biographies des d√©put√©s de la IVe R√©publique : Joseph Raseta Tsiranana frequently affirmed his membership of the western bloc: Tsiranana's administration thus aspired to respect human rights and the press was relatively free - as was the justice system.Ferdinand Deleris. Ratsiraka : socialisme et mis√®re √† Madagascar. √âditions L‚ÄôHarmattan. 1986. p.36 The Constitution of 1959 guaranteed political pluralism. The extreme left was allowed the right to political organisation. A fairly radical opposition existed in the form of the National Movement for the Independence of Madagascar (MONIMA), led by nationalist Monja Jaona who campaigned vigorously on behalf of the very poor Malagasy of the south, while AKFM extolled \\"scientific socialism\\" and close friendship with the USSR. Tsiranana presented himself as the protector of these parties and refused to join the \\"fashion\\" for single party states: Many institutions also existed as potential centres of opposition on the island. The Protestant and Catholic churches had great influence on the population. The various central unions were politically active in the urban centres. Associations, particularly of students and women, expressed themselves very freely. Nevertheless, Tsiranana's \\"democracy\\" had its limits. Outside the main centres, elections were rarely held in a fair and free manner.  Neutralisation of opposition fiefs  In October 1959, at the municipal elections, AKFM won control of only the capital Tananarive (under Richard Andriamanjato) and Diego Suarez (under Francis Sautron).Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.66 MONIMA won the mayoralty of Toliara (with Monja Jaona)Patrick Rajoelina. op. cit. p.108 and the mayoralty of Antsirabe (with Emile Rasakaiza). By skilful political manoeuvres, Tsiranana's government took control of these mayoralties, one by one. By decree n¬∞60.085 of 24 August 1960 it was established that \\"the administration of the city of Tananarive is henceforth entrusted to an official chosen by the Minister of the Interior and entitled General Delegate.\\" This official took on practically all the prerogatives of mayor Andriamanjato.Histoire de la commune de Tananarive Then, on 1 March 1961, Tsiranana \\"resigned\\" Monja Joana from his position as mayor of Toliara. A law of 15 July 1963, which stipulated that \\"the functions of the mayor and the 1st adjunct shall not be exercised by French citizens,\\" prevented Francis Sautron from standing for re-election as mayor of Diego Suarez in the municipal elections of December 1964.Eug√®ne Rousse, ¬´ Hommage √† Francis Sautron, Itin√©raire d‚Äôun R√©unionnais exceptionnel - II ‚Äì ¬ª, T√©moignages.re, 15 novembre 2003 In those municipal elections, the PSD won 14 of the 36 seats on the Antsirabe municipal council; AKFM won 14 and MONIMA 8.G√©rard Roy et J.Fr.

A few months later, Andr√© Resampa, Minister of the Interior, declared the town ungovernable and dissolved the municipal council. New elections were held in 1965, which the PSD won.  Toleration of parliamentary opposition  On 4 September 1960, the Malagasy held a parliamentary election.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.111 The government chose a majority general ticket ballot system, in order to enable PSD's success in all regions (especially Majunga and Toliara). However, in the district of Tananarive city, where there was solid support for AKFM, the vote was proportional. Thus, in the capital, the PSD won two seats (with 27,911 votes) under the leadership of Joseph Ravoahangy, while AKFM, led by Joseph Raseta, won three seats with 36,271. At the end of the election, the PSD held 75 seats in the Assembly,Patrick Rajoelina. op. cit. p.33 its allies held 29, and AKFM only had 3. The \\"3rd Force,\\" an alliance of thirteen local parties, received some 30% of the national vote (468,000 votes), but did not obtain a single seat. In October 1961, the \\"Antsirabe meeting\\" took place. There, Tsiranana pledged to reduce the number of political parties on the island, which then numbered 33.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.308 The PSD then absorbed its allies and was henceforth represented in the Assembly by 104 deputies. The Malagasy political scene was split between two very unequal factions: on the one side, the PSD, which was almost a one party state; on the other, AKFM, the sole opposition party tolerated by Tsiranana in parliament. This opposition was entrenched at the legislative elections of 8 August 1965. The PSD retained 104 deputies, with 94% of the national vote (2,304,000 votes), while the AKFM picked off 3 seats with 3.4% of the vote (145,000 votes).Patrick Rajoelina. op. cit. p.34 According to Tsiranana, the weakness of the opposition was due to the fact that its members \\"talk a lot but never act,\\" unlike those of the PSD, who were he claimed supported by the majority of Malagasy because they were organised, disciplined, and in permanent contact with the working class.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.307  Presidential election (1965)  On 16 June 1962, an institutional law established the rules for the election of the president of the Republic by universal direct suffrage. In February 1965, Tsiranana decided to end his seven-year term a year early and called a presidential election for 30 March 1965.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.260 Joseph Raseta, who had quit AKFM in 1963 in order to found his own party, the National Malagasy Union (FIPIMA), stood as a presidential candidate. An independent, Alfred Razafiarisoa, also stood.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.262 The leader of MONIMA, Monja Jaona, expressed a momentary desire to run, but AKFM made much of the economy of running only one opposition candidate against Tsiranana.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.261 It then discretely supported Tsiranana. Tsiranana's campaign ranged across the whole island, while those of his opponents were limited to local contexts by lack of money.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.279 On 30 March 1965, 2,521,216 votes were cast (the total number of people enrolled to vote was 2,583,051).Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.294 Tsiranana was re-elected as president with 2,451,441 votes, 97% of the total. Joseph Raseta received 54,814 votes and Alfred Razafiarisoa got 812. On 15 August 1965, in the legislative elections, the PSD obtained 2,475,469 votes out of 2,605,371 votes cast, in the seven districts of the country, some 95% of the vote. The opposition achieved 143,090 votes, principally in Tananarive, Diego Suarez, Tamatave, Fianarantsoa and Toliara.  \\"Malagasy Socialism\\"  Union of initiative in Madagascar in 1960. With independence and the consolidation of the new institutions, the government dedicated itself to the realisation of socialism. The \\"Malagasy Socialism\\" which President Tsiranana concocted was intended to resolve the problems of development by providing economic and social solutions adapted to the country; he considered it pragmatic and humanitarian.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.263 In order to analyse the country's economic situation, he held the \\"Malagasy Development Days\\" in Tananarive on the 25th and 27 April 1962.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.152 Through these national audits, it became clear that Madagascar's communication network was entirely insufficient and that there were problems surrounding access to water and electricity. With 5.5 million inhabitants in 1960, 89% of whom lived in the countryside, the country was underpopulated,Pays du monde : Madagascar. In Encyclop√©die Bordas, M√©moires du XXe si√®cle. √©dition 1995. Tome 17 ¬´ 1960-1969 ¬ª but it was potentially rich in agricultural resources. Like most of the Third World, it was experiencing a demographic explosion which closely followed the 3.7% annual average increase in agricultural production. The Minister of economy, Jacques Rabemananjara, was therefore entrusted with three goals: the diversification of the Malagasy economy in order to make it less dependent on imports,Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.156 which exceeded US$20 million in 1969; reduce the deficit of the trade balance (which was US$6 million), in order to consolidate Madagascar's independence; and increase the population's purchasing power and quality of life (the GNP per capita was less than $US 101 per year in 1960). The economic policy instituted by Tsiranana's administration incorporated a neo-liberal ethos, combining encouragement of (national and foreign) private initiative and state intervention. In 1964, a five year plan was adopted, setting out the major government investment plans. These focused on the development of agriculture and support for farmers.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.19 For the realisation of this plan, it was envisaged that the private sector would contribute 55 billion Malagasy francs.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.23 To encourage this investment, the government set out to create a regime favourable to lenders using four institutions: the Institut d'√âmission Malgache, the state treasury, the Malagasy National Bank, and above all the National Investment Society, which participated in some of the larger Malagasy and foreign commercial and industrial enterprises.Patrick Rajoelina. op. cit. p.32 To ensure the confidence of foreign capitalists, Tsiranana condemned the principle of nationalisation: This did not prevent the government from instituting a 50% tax on commercial profits not reinvested in Madagascar.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.21 =Cooperatives and state intervention= If Tsiranana was entirely hostile to the idea of socialising the means of production, he was nevertheless a socialist. His government encouraged the development of cooperatives and other means of voluntary participation. The Israeli kibbutz was investigated as the key to agricultural development. In 1962, a General Commissariat for Cooperation was created, charged with instituting cooperatives in production and commercial activity.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.20 In 1970, the cooperatie sector held a monopoly on the harvesting of vanilla. It completely controlled the harvesting, processing, and export of bananas. It played a major role in the cultivation of coffee, cloves and rice. In addition, large irrigation schemes were carried out by mixed economy societies, like SOMALAC (Society for the Management of Lake Alaotra) which supported more than 5,000 rice farmers. The main obstacle to development lay largely in the development of land. In order to remedy this, the state entrusted small scale work \\"at ground level\\" to the (the lowest level Malagasy administrative division equivalent to a French commune). The fokon'olona were entitled to create rural infrastructure and small dams, within the framework of the regional development plan. In these works, they were assisted by the gendarmerie, which was actively involved in national reforestation schemes, and by the civic service.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.320 Instituted in 1960 to combat idleness,Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.125 the civic service enabled Malagasy youth to acquire a general education and professional training.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.202 = Education as a motor for development = In the area of education, an effort to increase the literacy of the rural population was undertaken, with the civic service's young conscripts playing a notable role. Primary education was available in most cities and villages. The expenditure on education exceeded 8 billion Malagasy francs in 1960 and was more than 20 billion by 1970 - a rise from 5.8% to 9.0% of GDP.Philippe Hugon. Economie et enseignement √† Madagascar. Institut international de planification de l‚Äô√©ducation 1976. p.10 This enabled the primary school workforce to be doubled from 450,000 to nearly a million, the secondary school workforce to be quadrupled from 26,000 to 108,000 and the higher education workforce to be sextupled from 1,100 to 7,000.Philippe Hugon. op. cit. p.37 Lyc√©es were opened in all provinces, as well as the transformation of the Centre of Higher Studies of Tananarive into the University of Madagascar in October 1961.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.62 As a result of this increased education, Tsiranana planned to establish a number of Malagasy technical and administrative groups. = Economic results (1960‚Äì1972) = In the end, of the 55 billion Malagasy Francs expected from the private sector in the first five-year plan, only 27.2 were invested between 1964 and 1968. The objective had however been exceeded in the secondary sector, with 12.44 billion Malagasy francs rather than the projected 10.7 billion. Industry remained embryonic,G√©rald Donque. Madagascar. In Encyclop√©die Universalis. Tome 10. √âdition 1973. p.277 despite an increase in its value from 6.3 billion Malagasy francs in 1960 to 33.6 billion in 1971, an average annual increase of 15%.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.26 It was the processing sector which grew the most: *In the agricultural area, rice mills, starch manufacturers, oil mills, sugar refineries and canning plants were developed. *In the uplands, the cotton factory of Antsirabe increased its production from 2,100 tonnes to 18,700 tonnes,Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.25 and the Madagascar paper mill (PAPMAD) was created in Tananarive. *A petrol refinery was built in the port city of Tamatave. These developments lead to the creation of 300,000 new jobs in industry, increasing the total from 200,000 in 1960 to 500,000 in 1971. On the other hand, in the primary sector, private sector initiatives were less numerous. There were several reasons for this: issues with the soil and climate, as well as transport and commercialisation roblems.Charles Cadoux. Madagascar. In Encyclop√©die Universalis. Tome 10. 1973 Edition. p.277 The communication network remained inadequate. Under Tsiranana there were only three railway routes: Tananarive- Tamatave (with a branch leading to Lake Alaotra), Tananarive-Antsirabe, and Fianarantsoa-Manakara. The 3,800 km of roads (2,560 km of which were asphalted) mostly served to link Tananarive to the port cities. Vast regions remained isolated. The ports, although poorly equipped, enabled some degree of cabotage. Malagasy agriculture thus remained essentially subsistence based under Tsiranana, except in certain sectors, like the production of unshelled rice which grew from 1,200,000 tonnes in 1960 to 1,870,000 tonnes in 1971, an increase of 50%. Self-sufficiency in terms of food was nearly achieved.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.24 Each year, between 15,000 and 20,000 tonnes of de luxe rice was exported. Madagascar also increased its export of coffee from 56,000 tonnes in 1962 to 73,000 tonnes in 1971 ad its export of bananas from 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes per year. Finally, under Tsiranana, the island was the world's primary producer of vanilla. Yet dramatic economic growth did not occur. The GNP per capita only increased by US$30 in the nine years after 1960, reaching only US$131 in 1969. Imports increased, reaching US$28 million in 1969, increasing the trade deficit to US$11 million. A couple of power plants provided electricity to only Tananarive, Tamatave and Fianarantsoa. The annual energy consumption per person only increased a little from 38 kg (carbon equivalent) to 61 kg between 1960 and 1969. This situation was not catastrophic. Inflation increased annually by 4.1% between 1965 and 1973. The external debt was small. The service of the debt in 1970 represented only 0.8% of GNP. The currency reserves were not negligible - in 1970 they contained 270 million francs. The budget deficit was kept within very strict limits. The low population freed the island from the danger of famine and the bovine population (very important for subsistence farmers) was estimated at 9 million. The leader of the opposition, Marxist pastor Andriamanjato declared that he was \\"80% in agreement\\" with the economic policy pursued by Tsiranana.  Privileged partnership with France  During Tsiranana's presidency, the links between Madagascar and France remained extremely strong in all areas. Tsiranana assured those French people living on the island that they formed Madagascar's 19th tribe.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.22 Tsiranana was surrounded by an entourage of French technical advisors, the \\"vazahas\\",Philibert Tsiranana 2e partie (1er juin 2007), √âmission de RFI ¬´ Archives d'Afrique ¬ª of whom the most important were: * Paul Roulleau, who headed the cabinet and was involved in all economic affairs. * General Bocchino, Chief of defence, who in practice performed the functions of Minister of Defence. French military manoevres in Madagascar, 1960. French officials in Madagascar continued to ensure the operation of the administrative machinery until 1963/1964.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.31 After that, they were reduced to an advisory role and, with rare exceptions, they lost all influence. In their concern for the renewal of their contracts, some of these adopted an irresponsible and complaisant attitude towards their ministers, directors, or department heads. The security of the state was placed under the responsibility of French troops, who continued to occupy various strategic bases on the island. French parachutists were based at the Ivato-Tananarive international airport, while the Commander in Chief of the French military forces in the Indian Ocean was based at Diego Suarex harbour at the north end of the country.Patrick Rajoelina. op. cit. p.35 When the French government decided to withdraw nearly 1,200 troops from Madagascar in January 1964,Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.208 Tsiranana took offence: From independence, Madagascar was in the franc-zone. Membership of this zone allowed Madagascar to assure foreign currency cover for recognised priority imports, to provide a guaranteed market for certain agricultural products (bananas, meat, sugar, de luxe rice, pepper etc.) at above average prices, to secure private investment, and to maintain a certain rigour in the state budget.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.29 In 1960, 73% of exports went to the franc-zone, with France among the main trade partners, supplying 10 billion CFA francs to the Malagasy economy. France provided a particularly important source of aid to the sum of 400 million dollars, for twelve years.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.30 This aid, in all its forms, was equal to two thirds of the Malagasy national budget until 1964.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.206 Further, thanks to the conventions of association with the European Economic Community (EEC), the advantages arising from the market organisations of the franc-zone, the Aid Fund, and the French Cooperation (FAC), were transferred to the community's level. Madagascar was also able to benefit from appreciable favoured tariff status and received around 160 million dollars in aid from the EEC between 1965 and 1971. Beyond this strong financial dependency, Tsiranana's Madagascar seemed to preserve the preponderant French role in the economy.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.27 Banks, insurance agencies, high scale commerce, industry and some agricultural production (sugar, sisal, tobacco, cotton, etc.) remained under the control of the foreign minority.  Foreign Policy  Philibert Tsiranana in West Berlin in 1962, accompanied by Willy Brandt, Governing Mayor of West Berlin Philibert Tsiranana in Jerusalem in 1961, with Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, President of Israel. This partnership with France gave the impression that Madagascar was completely enfiefed to the old metropole and voluntairly accepted an invasive neo-colonialism. In fact, by this French policy, Tsiranana simply tried to extract the maximum amount of profit for his country in the face of the insurmountable constraints against seeking other ways. In order to free himself from French economic oversight, Tsiranana made diplomatic and commercial links with other states sharing his ideology: * West Germany, which imported around 585 million CFA francs of Malagasy products in 1960. West Germany signed an economic collaboration treaty with Madagascar on 21 September 1962, which granted Madagascar 1.5 billion CFA francs of credit.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.167 Further, the Philibert Tsiranana Foundation, instituted in 1965 and charged with forming political and administrative recruits for the PSD, was funded by the Social Democratic Party of Germany. * The United States, which imported around 2 billion CFA francs of Malagasy products in 1960, granted 850 million CFAfrancs between 1961 and 1964.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.221 * Taiwan, which sought to continue relations after his visit to the island in April 1962.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.147 An attempt at a commercial overture towards the Communist bloc and southern Africa including Malawi and South Africa. But this eclecticism provoked some controversy, particularly when the results were not visible. Soviet stamp depicting Kwame Nkrumah. Tsiranana advocated moderation and realism in international organs like the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), and the African and Malagasy Union (AMU). He was opposed to the Panafricanist ideas proposed by Kwame Nkrumah. For his part, he undertook to cooperate with Africa in the economic sphere, but not in the political arena.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.122 During the second summit of the OAU in Cairo on 19 July 1964, he declared that the organisation was weakened by three illnesses: He served as mediator from 6‚Äì13 March 1961, during a round-table organised by him in Tananarive to permit the various belligerents in the Congo Crisis to work out a solution to the conflict.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.136 It was decided to transform the Republic of Congo into a confederation, led by Joseph Kasavubu. But this mediation was in vain, since the conflict soon resumed. If Tsiranana seemed moderate, he was nevertheless deeply anti-communist. He did not hesitate to boycott the third conference of the OAU held at Accra in October 1965 by the radical President of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.328 On 5 November 1965, he attacked the People's Republic of China and affirmed that \\"coups d'etat always bear the traces of Communist China.\\"Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.331 A little later, on 5 January 1966, after the Saint-Sylvestre coup d'√©tat in the Central African Republic, he went so far as to praise those who carried out the coup:  The decline and fall of the regime (1967-1972)  From 1967, Tsiranana faced mounting criticism. In the first place, it was clear that the structures put in place by \\"Malagasy Socialism\\" to develop the country were not having a major macro-economic effect.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.21 Further, some measures were unpopular, like the ban on the mini- skirt, which was an obstacle to tourism.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.32 In November 1968, a document entitled Dix ann√©es de R√©publique (Ten Years of the Republic) was published, which had been drafted by a French technical assistant and a Malagasy and which harshly criticised the leaders of PSD, denouncing some financial scandals which the authors attributed to members of the government.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.55 An investigation was initiated which culminated in the imprisonment of one of the authors. Intellectuals were provoked by this affair. Finally, the inevitable wear of the regime over time created a subdued but clear undercurrent of opposition.  Challenges to the Francophile policy  Between 1960 and 1972, both Merina and coastal Malagasy were largely convinced that although political independence had been realised, economic independence had not been. The French controlled the economy and held almost all the technical posts of the Malagasy senior civil service. The revision of the Franco-Malagasy accords and significant nationalisation were seen by many Malagasy as offering a way to free up between five and ten thousand jobs, then held by Europeans, which could be replaced by locals. Another centre of opposition was Madagascar's membership of the franc-zone. Contemporary opinion had it that as long as Madagascar remained in this zone, only subsidiaries and branches of French banks would do business in Madagascar. These banks were unwilling to take any risk to support the establishment of Malagasy enterprises, using insufficient guarantees as their excuse. In addition, the Malagasy had only limited access to credit, compared to the French, who received priority. Finally, membership of the franc-zone involved regular restrictions on the free movement of goods. In 1963 at the 8th PSD congress, some leaders of the governing party raised the possibility of revising the Franco-Malagasy accords.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.203 At the 11th congress in 1967, their revision was practically demanded. Andr√© Resampa, the strongman of the regime, was the proponent of this.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.22  Tsiranana's illness  Tsiranana suffered from a Cardiovascular disease. In June 1966, his health degraded sharply; he was forced to spend two and half months convalescing,Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.353 and to spend three weeks in France receiving treatment.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.357 Officially, Tsiranana's sickness was simply one brought on by fatigue.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.358 Subsequently, Tsiranana frequently visited Paris for examinations and the French Riviera for rest.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.47 Despite this, his health did not improve.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.64 Georges Pompidou. After being absent for some time, Tsiranana reaffirmed his authority and his role as head of government at the end of 1969. He announced on 2 December, to general surprise, that he would \\"dissolve\\" the government, despite the fact that this was not constitutional without a motion of censure. A fortnight later, he formed a new government, which was the same as the old one except for two exceptions.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.72 In January 1970, while he was once again absent in France, his health deteriorated suddenly. The French President Georges Pompidou said to Jacques Foccart: Nevertheless, Tsiranana travelled to Yaound√© to participate in an OCAM meeting. On his arrival in the Cameroonian capital on 28 January 1970, he had a heart attack and had to be taken back to Paris on a special flight to be treated at Piti√©- Salp√™tri√®re Hospital.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.78 The President was in a coma for ten days, but when he awoke he retained almost all his faculties and the power of speech.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.87 He remained in hospital until 14 May 1970.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.85 During this three and a half month period, he received visits from numerous French and Malagasy politicians, including, on 8 April, the head of the opposition, Richard Andriamanjato, who was on his way back from Moscow.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.84 On 24 May, Tsiranana returned to Madagascar. In December 1970, he announced his decision to remain in power because he considered himself to have recovered his health.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.105 But his political decline had only just begun. Encouraged by the cult of personality which surrounded him,Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.8 Tsiranana became authoritarian and irritable. He sometimes claimed divine support: In fact, cut off from reality by an entourage of self-interested courtiers, he showed himself unable to appreciate the socio-economic situation.  Succession conflicts  The competition for the succession to Tsiranana began in 1964.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.32 On achieving control, a muffled battle broke out between two wings of the PSD. On the one side was the moderate, liberal and Christian wing symbolised by Jacques Rabemananjara, which was opposed by the progressivist tendency represented by the powerful minister of the interior, Andr√© Resampa. In that year, Rabemananjara, then minister of the economy, was victim of a campaign of accusations led by a group in the Tananarive press, which included PSD affiliated journalists. Rabemananjara was accused of corruption in an affair related to the supply of rice. The campaign was inspired by senator Rakotondrazaka, a very close associate of Andr√© Resampa; the senator proved incapable of supply the slightest proof of these allegations.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.33 Tsiranana did nothing to defend Rabemananjara's honour, who exchanged the Economy portfolio for agriculture on 31 August 1965Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.311 and then took the foreign affairs portfolio in July 1967.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.20 Some austerity measures and spending cuts concerning cabinet ministers were introduced in September 1965: cancellation of various perks and allowances, including notably the use of administrative vehicles.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.313 But the government's image had been tarnished. Paradoxically, on 14 February 1967, Tsiranana encouraged government officials and members of parliamenta to participate in the effort to industrialise the country, by participating in business enterprises which had become established in the provinces.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome I. p.371 In his mind, he was encouraging entrepreneurs in their activities and the involvement of political personalities was presented by him as a patriotic gesture to promote the development of investments throughout the country. However, corruption was clearly visible in the countryside, where even the slightest enterprise required the payment of bribes.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.35 In 1968, Andr√© Resampa, the Minister of the Interior, appeared to be Tsiranana's chosen successor.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.50 During Tsiranana's emergency hospitalisation in January 1970, however, Resampa's dominance was far from clear. Aside from Jacques Rabemananjara, Alfred Nany, who was President of the National Assembly, nurtured presidential ambitions.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.66 Resampa's main adversary however was Vice-President Calvin Tsiebo who benefitted from constitutional provisions concerning the exercise of power in the absence of the president and had the support of \\"Monsieur Afrique de l‚Äô√âlys√©e\\" Jacques Foccart, the President of France's chief of staff for African and Madagascan affairs. After Tsiranana re-established himself in 1970, a rapid revision of the constitution was carried out. Four Vice-Presidents were placed in charge of a much enlarged government, attempting to prevent fear of a power void. Resampa was officially invested with the First Vice-Presidency of the government, while Tsiebo was relegated to a subordinate role.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.95 Resampa seemed to have won the contest. Then relations between Tsiranana and Resampa deteriorated. Resampa, who supported the denunciation of the Franco-Malagasy Accords, got the National Council of PSD to pass a motion calling for their revision on 7 November 1970. Tsiranana was outraged. He let his entourage persuade him that Rasempa was involved in a \\"conspiracy.\\"Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.106 On the evening of 26 January 1971, Tsiranana ordered the gendarmerie in Tananarive to be reinforced, put the army on alert, and increased the Presidential Palace Guard.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.111 On 17 February 1971, he dissolved the government. Resampa lost the ministry of the interior, which Tsiranana took over personal control of, and Tsiebo became the First Vice-President.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.114 According to the diaries published by Foccart, France did not take any particular pleasure in these events. Foccart is meant to have said to the French President Pompidou on 2 April 1971: On 1 June 1971, Andr√© Resampa was arrested on the instruction of the council of ministers.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.128 He was accused of conspiring with the American government and was placed under house arrest on the small island of Sainte-Marie. Some years later, Tsiranana confessed that this conspiracy was fabricated.  Rotaka  At the legislative elections of 6 September 1970, the PSD won 104 seats, while the AKFM secured three.Patrick Rajoelina. op. cit. p.40 The opposition party submitted some 600 complaints about the conduct of the election, none of which were investigated.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.155 In the Presidential election of 30 January 1972, 98.8% of registered voters took part and Tsiranana, who ran without opposition, was re-elected with 99.72% of votes.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.168Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.172 During the election however, a few journalists had property seized and there was a witchhunt of publications criticising the results of the vote, the methods employed to achieve victory, and the threats and pressure brought to bear on voters in order to get them to the ballot box. Tsiranana's \\"restrained democracy\\" showed its weakness. Convinced that they could not succeed at the polls, the opposition decided to take to the streets. This opposition was supported by the Merina elite which Tsiranana and Resampa had pushed far from the centres of decision making. =Farmer Protests= Entrance of Toliara gaol. In the night of 31 March and 1 April 1971, an insurrection was launched in the south of Madagascar, particularly in the city of Toliara and the region around it. The rebels, led by Monja Jaona, consisted of ranchers from the south-east who refused to pay their heavy taxes and exorbitant mandatory fees to the PSD party.Patrick Rajoelina. op. cit. p.37 The area, which was particularly poor, had been long awaiting aid since it frequently suffered from both droughts and cyclones. MONIMA therefore had no trouble stirring up the people to occupy and loot official buildings. The insurrection was rapidly and thoroughly suppressed.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.122 The official death toll of 45 insurgents was contested by Jaona, who claimed that more than a thousand had died. Jaona was arrested and his party was banned. The exactions of the gendarmerie (whose commander, Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava would later be president in 1975 for six days before his assassination) in response to the insurrection triggered a strong hostility to the \\"PSD state\\" across the country. Tsiranana attempted to appease the populace. He criticised the behaviour of some hard-line officials who had exploited the poor; he also condemned the officials who had abused and extorted money and cattle from people returning to their villages after the insurrection. = The Malagasy May = In mid-March, the government's failure to address the demands of medical students spurred a protest movement at Befelatanana school in the capital.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p. 178 On 24 March 1971, a university protest was announced by the Federation of Student Associations of Madagascar (FAEM), in support of AKFM.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p. 119 It was observed by around 80% of the country's five thousand students. The next day, Tsiranana ordered the closure of the university, saying: On 19 April 1972, the Association of Medical and Pharmaceutical Students, which had originally made the demands, was dissolved. This measure was enacted by the new strongman of the regime, Minister of the Interior Barth√©l√©my Johasy, who also reinforced the censorship of the press. In protest against this policy, the universities and lyc√©es of the capital initiated a new round of protests from 24 April. Talks were held between the government and the protestors, but each side maintained their position.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.182 The protest spread, reaching Fianarantsoa on 28 April and Antsirabe on 29 April.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.187 It was then massively augmented by secondary school students in the provincial towns, who denounced \\"the Franco-Malagasy accords and the crimes of cultural imperialism.\\"Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.189 The authorities were overstretched and panicked. They had 380 students and student-sympathisers arrested on the evening of 12 May, in order to be imprisoned in the penal colony on , a small island to the north of Madagascar.Ferdinand Deleris. op. cit. p.7 The next day, a massive protest against the regime in Tananarive was led by some five thousand students. The forces of order, consisting of a few dozen members of the Republican Security Forces (FRS), were completely overwhelmed by events;Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.194 they fired on the protesters. But order was not restored. On the contrary, the protest increased. The official death toll of 13 May was 7 members of the FRS and 21 protesters, with more than 200 wounded.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.195 This violence caused most officials in the capital and the employees of many businesses to cease work, which further discredited the government.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p. 197 On 15 May, several thousand protesters marched on the Presidential Palace, seeking the return of the 380 imprisoned students. The march was marked by a clash with the FRS leading to the deaths of five members of the FRS and five protesters.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p. 198 The gendarmerie was ordered to come to the rescue, but refused to participate in the repression of the populace, while the army adopted an ambiguous position. Finally, the government decided to withdraw the FRS units and replace them with military forces. Tsiranana had been at a thermal health spa in Ranomafana near Fiarnarantsoa. He now returned to Tananarive, and immediately ordered the 380 prisoners to be freed, which occurred on 16 May.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p. 200 But Tsiranana's authority was more and more openly contested.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p. 202 The opposition took strength on 17 May when the French government announced that the French armed forces on the island \\"are not intervening and will not intervene in the crisis in Madagascar, which is an internal crisis\\". Having failed to mobilise his supporters, Tsiranana appointed General Gabriel Ramanantsoa, the Chief of defence, as prime minister. He vested Ramanantsoa with full presidential powers as well.Madagascar at Encyclopedia Britannica  Efforts to regain power (1972‚Äì1975)  Tsiranana was still nominally president, and viewed his grant of full powers to Ramanantsoa as a temporary measure. He told Jacque Foccart on 22 May 1972 But after 18 May he had no actual power.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.212 His presence was politically unhelpful and cumbersome to others. Gradually, Tsiranana became aware of this. During a private trip to Majunga on 22 July, protestors met him with hostile banners, saying things like \\"we are fed up with you, Papa\\" and \\"The PSD is finished.\\"Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.216 Tsiranana also saw that his statue in the centre of Majunga had been overthrown during the May protests. He was finally convinced that his presidency was over by the constitutional referendum of 8 October 1972, in which 96.43% of voters voted to grant Ramanantsoa full powers for five years, thus confirming Tsiranana's fall from power. Tsiranana officially left office on 11 October. Describing himself as \\"President of the Suspended Republic\\", Tsiranana did not retire from political life and became a virulent opponent of the military regime.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.237 General Ramanantsoa informed him that he was not to talk about political decisions and that he was no longer authorised to make declarations to journalists. The PSD experienced judicial harassment with the arrest of many prominent party members.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.238 During the consultative elections of the National Popular Development Council (CNPD) on 21 October 1973, the PSD was the victim of electoral irregularities.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.241 Candidates supporting the military regime won 130 of the 144 seats up for election. During this election, Tsiranana reconciled with his old minister Andr√© Resampa, who had been released in May 1972 and had subsequently established the Union of Malagasy Socialists (USM). This reconciliation led to the merger of PSD and USM on 10 March 1974, to become the Malagasy Socialist Party (PSM), with Tisranana as president and Resampa as general secretary.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.247 PSM called for a coalition government in order to put an end to economic and social disorder, especially food shortages, linked to the \\"Malagisation\\" and \\"socialisation\\" of Malagasy society. In a memorandum of 3 February 1975, Tsiranana proposed the creation of a \\"committee of elders,\\" which would select a well-known person who would form a provisional government in order to organise free and fair elections within ninety days.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.293  Later life and death (1975‚Äì1978)  After the resignation of Ramanantsoa and the accession of Richard Ratsimandrava as head of state on 5 February 1975, Tsiranana decided to retire from political life.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.299 But six days later, on 11 February 1975, Ratsimandrava was assassinated. An extraordinary military tribunal carried out the \\"trial of the century.\\" Among the 296 people charged was Tsiranana, who was accused by the eight military chiefs of \\"complicity in the assassination of Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava, Head of State and of Government.\\"Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.313 Eventually, Tsiranana was released due to lack of evidence. After the trial, Tsiranana ceased to have a high profile in Madagascar.Andr√© Saura. op. cit. Tome II. p.330 He travelled to France for a time to visit his family there and to consult with his doctors. On 14 April 1978 he was transported to Tananarive in a critical state. Admitted to Befelatanana hospital in a coma, he never regained consciousness and he died on Sunday 16 April 1978 late in the afternoon. The Supreme Revolutionary Council, led by Didier Ratsiraka, organised a national funeral for him. The vast crowd in Tananarive, which gathered for the funeral, testified to the public respect and affection for him in the end, which has generally endured since his death. Tsiranana's wife, Justine Tsiranana, who served as the country's inaugural First Lady, died in 1999. His son Philippe Tsiranana stood in the 2006 presidential election, placing twelfth with only 0.03% of the vote.Official results from the Madagascar Interior Ministry (in French) .

He was the first artist to employ DNA marking patterns in paintings, in his 1992 work Designer Gene. Ashbaugh‚Äôs use of light and color in his large scale paintings of autoradiographs have drawn comparison to Mark Rothko. He is the longtime companion of author Alexandra Penney and grandfather of Celeste Penney. He has been characterized by the New York Times as a ‚Äúcharismatic ex‚Äêsurfer whose address book can probably hold its own against that of the most aggressive jet set type‚Äù. Early life Ashbaugh moved with his family to Southern California at the age 6, where he learned to surf and lived next door to the now famous Dana Point [surfer] Mafia. He earned a Bachelor of Arts and a master's degree from the University of California. He moved to New York City in 1969 to take up residence near leading artists and began immediately showing his paintings in galleries throughout the city and internationally. Awards and exhibitions He received a New York Council for the Arts Creative Artists Public Service (CAPS) grant in 1975, and prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 1976, in addition to numerous smaller fellowships and grants throughout his forty-year career. Ashbaugh has had solo exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, PS1, The Seattle Museum of Art, The Orange County Museum of Art, La Jolla Museum of Art, and the Americas Society. He has exhibited internationally in London, Paris, Brussels, Tehran, Capri, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, and Slovenia. Most recently, in 2007, Ashbaugh had a 200-page book retrospective at IVAM entitled ‚ÄúSay Goodbye to The Past‚Äù ‚Äê including a monograph and catalog by art historian Barbara Rose. The National Academy of Sciences mounted a survey of Ashbaugh‚Äôs recent paintings in 2006 with a full color catalog by J.D. Talasek. Collaboration with William Gibson Ashbaugh is well known for his 1992 collaboration with science fiction and cyberpunk novelist William Gibson, Agrippa (A Book of the Dead). Gibson‚Äôs influence, and that of his friend and fellow cyberpunk novelist Bruce Sterling, on Ashbaugh is undeniable. Ashbaugh himself notes, ‚ÄúTheir writings had an important impact on me‚Ä¶ When I first walked through the chaos of the East Village and thought, ‚ÄòOh what a lovely place this is.‚Äô It changed my notion of urban decay‚Äù. Dominant themes and issues Ashbaugh has continually reinvented himself as contemporary society, and the issues facing it, evolve. Dominant themes of his works are computers, clones, DNA, networks, and viruses (computer and biological) ‚Äê though he does not use computers to create these works. Current work Ashbaugh is currently working on a new series of painting titled ‚ÄúHiding In Plain Sight‚Äù, which focus on privacy issues, ubiquitous surveillance, and genetic databases in the context of 21st century art. Ashbaugh has produced a series of prints and drawings and large group of mosquito trap sculptures. He is working on a book of the same title.

Within the broader private equity industry, two distinct sub-industries, leveraged buyouts and venture capital experienced growth along parallel although interrelated tracks. The origins of the modern private equity industry trace back to 1946 with the formation of the first venture capital firms. The thirty-five-year period from 1946 through the end of the 1970s was characterized by relatively small volumes of private equity investment, rudimentary firm organizations and limited awareness of and familiarity with the private equity industry. Pre- history J.P. Morgan's acquisition of Carnegie Steel Company in 1901 represents arguably the first true modern buyout Investors have been acquiring businesses and making minority investments in privately held companies since the dawn of the industrial revolution. Merchant bankers in London and Paris financed industrial concerns in the 1850s; most notably Cr√©dit Mobilier, founded in 1854 by Jacob and Isaac Pereire, who together with New York-based Jay Cooke financed the United States Transcontinental Railroad. Jay Gould also acquired, merged, and organized railroads and telegraph companies in the second half of the 19th century, including Western Union, the Erie Railroad, Union Pacific and the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Andrew Carnegie sold his steel company to J.P. Morgan in 1901 in arguably the first true modern buyout Later, J. Pierpont Morgan's J.P. Morgan & Co. would finance railroads and other industrial companies throughout the United States. In certain respects, J. Pierpont Morgan's 1901 acquisition of Carnegie Steel Company from Andrew Carnegie and Henry Phipps for $480 million represents the first true major buyout as they are thought of today. Due to structural restrictions imposed on American banks under the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act and other regulations in the 1930s, there was no private merchant banking industry in the United States, a situation that was quite exceptional in developed nations. As late as the 1980s, Lester Thurow, a noted economist, decried the inability of the financial regulation framework in the United States to support merchant banks. US investment banks were confined primarily to advisory businesses, handling mergers and acquisitions transactions and placements of equity and debt securities. Investment banks would later enter the space, however long after independent firms had become well established. With few exceptions, private equity in the first half of the 20th century was the domain of wealthy individuals and families. The Vanderbilts, Whitneys, Rockefellers and Warburgs were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century. In 1938, Laurance S. Rockefeller helped finance the creation of both Eastern Air Lines and Douglas Aircraft and the Rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies. Eric M. Warburg founded E.M. Warburg & Co. in 1938, which would become Warburg Pincus, with investments in leveraged buyouts and venture capital. Origins of modern private equity It was not until after World War II that what is considered today to be true private equity investments began to emerge marked by the founding of the first two venture capital firms in 1946: American Research and Development Corporation. (ARDC) and J.H. Whitney & Company.Wilson, John. The New Ventures, Inside the High Stakes World of Venture Capital. ARDC was founded by Georges Doriot, the \\"father of venture capitalism\\"WGBH Public Broadcasting Service, ‚ÄúWho made America?\\"-Georges Doriot‚Äù (former dean of Harvard Business School), with Ralph Flanders and Karl Compton (former president of MIT), to encourage private sector investments in businesses run by soldiers who were returning from World War II. ARDC's significance was primarily that it was the first institutional private equity investment firm that raised capital from sources other than wealthy families although it had several notable investment successes as well.The New Kings of Capitalism, Survey on the Private Equity industry The Economist, November 25, 2004 ARDC is credited with the first major venture capital success story when its 1957 investment of $70,000 in Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) would be valued at over $355 million after the company's initial public offering in 1968 (representing a return of over 500 times on its investment and an annualized rate of return of 101%).Joseph W. Bartlett, \\"What Is Venture Capital?\\" Former employees of ARDC went on to found several prominent venture capital firms including Greylock Partners (founded in 1965 by Charlie Waite and Bill Elfers) and Morgan, Holland Ventures, the predecessor of Flagship Ventures (founded in 1982 by James Morgan).Kirsner, Scott. \\"Venture capital's grandfather.\\" The Boston Globe, April 6, 2008. ARDC continued investing until 1971 with the retirement of Doriot. In 1972, Doriot merged ARDC with Textron after having invested in over 150 companies. J.H. Whitney & Company was founded by John Hay Whitney and his partner Benno Schmidt. Whitney had been investing since the 1930s, founding Pioneer Pictures in 1933 and acquiring a 15% interest in Technicolor Corporation with his cousin Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. By far, Whitney's most famous investment was in Florida Foods Corporation. The company, having developed an innovative method for delivering nutrition to American soldiers, later came to be known as Minute Maid orange juice and was sold to The Coca- Cola Company in 1960. J.H. Whitney & Company continues to make investments in leveraged buyout transactions and raised $750 million for its sixth institutional private equity fund in 2005. Before World War II, venture capital investments (originally known as \\"development capital\\") were primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families. One of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The 1958 Act officially allowed the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to license private \\"Small Business Investment Companies\\" (SBICs) to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the United States. Passage of the Act addressed concerns raised in a Federal Reserve Board report to Congress that concluded that a major gap existed in the capital markets for long-term funding for growth-oriented small businesses. Additionally, it was thought that fostering entrepreneurial companies would spur technological advances to compete against the Soviet Union. Facilitating the flow of capital through the economy up to the pioneering small concerns in order to stimulate the U.S. economy was and still is the main goal of the SBIC program today.Small Business Administration Investment Division (SBIC) The 1958 Act provided venture capital firms structured either as SBICs or Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Companies (MESBICs) access to federal funds which could be leveraged at a ratio of up to 4:1 against privately raised investment funds. The success of the Small Business Administration's efforts are viewed primarily in terms of the pool of professional private equity investors that the program developed as the rigid regulatory limitations imposed by the program minimized the role of SBICs. In 2005, the SBA significantly reduced its SBIC program, though SBICs continue to make private equity investments. Early venture capital and the growth of Silicon Valley (1959 - 1981) Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California, where many Bay Area venture capital firms are based During the 1960s and 1970s, venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies. More often than not, these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic, medical or data-processing technology. As a result, venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance. It is commonly noted that the first venture-backed startup was Fairchild Semiconductor (which produced the first commercially practicable integrated circuit), funded in 1959 by what would later become Venrock Associates.The Future of Securities Regulation speech by Brian G. Cartwright, General Counsel U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. University of Pennsylvania Law School Institute for Law and Economics Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. October 24, 2007. Venrock was founded in 1969 by Laurance S. Rockefeller, the fourth of John D. Rockefeller's six children as a way to allow other Rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments. It was also in the 1960s that the common form of private equity fund, still in use today, emerged. Private equity firms organized limited partnerships to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as general partner and the investors, who were passive limited partners, put up the capital. The compensation structure, still in use today, also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of 1-2% and a carried interest typically representing up to 20% of the profits of the partnership. An early West Coast venture capital company was Draper and Johnson Investment Company, formed in 1962 Web site history by William Henry Draper III and Franklin P. Johnson Jr. In 1964 Bill Draper and Paul Wythes founded Sutter Hill Ventures, and Pitch Johnson formed Asset Management Company. The growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on Sand Hill Road, beginning with Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital in 1972. Located, in Menlo Park, CA, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the burgeoning technology industries in the area. By the early 1970s, there were many semiconductor companies based in the Santa Clara Valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies.In 1971, a series of articles entitled \\"Silicon Valley USA\\" were published in the Electronic News, a weekly trade publication, giving rise to the use of the term Silicon Valley. Throughout the 1970s, a group of private equity firms, focused primarily on venture capital investments, would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms. In 1973, with the number of new venture capital firms increasing, leading venture capitalists formed the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). The NVCA was to serve as the industry trade group for the venture capital industry.Official website of the National Venture Capital Association, the largest trade association for the venture capital industry. Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund. It was not until 1978 that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year, as the industry raised approximately $750 million. During this period, the number of venture firms also increased. Among the firms founded in this period, in addition to Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia, that continue to invest actively are: *TA Associates, a venture capital firm (and later leveraged buyouts as well), originally part of the Tucker Anthony brokerage firm, founded in 1968; *Mayfield Fund, founded by early Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tommy Davis in 1969; *Apax Partners, the firm's earliest predecessor, the venture capital firm Patricof & Co. was founded in 1969 and subsequently merged with Multinational Management Group (founded 1972) and later with Saunders Karp & Megrue (founded 1989); *Menlo Ventures, co-founded by H.DuBose Montgomery in 1976; *New Enterprise Associates founded by Chuck Newhall, Frank Bonsal and Dick Kramlich in 1978; *Oak Investment Partners founded in 1978; and *Sevin Rosen Funds founded by L.J. Sevin and Ben Rosen in 1980. Venture capital played an instrumental role in developing many of the major technology companies of the 1980s. Some of the most notable venture capital investments were made in firms that include: *Tandem Computers, an early manufacturer of computer systems, founded in 1975 by Jimmy Treybig with funding from Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers.Tandem Computers FundingUniverse.com *Genentech a biotechnology company, founded in 1976 with venture capital from Robert A.

A second round of financing for an additional $16 million was completed in March 1982. The firm went public on May 13, 1983, netting $153 million, the largest technology IPO to that point. Early history of leveraged buyouts (1955-1981)=McLean Industries and public holding companies Although not strictly private equity, and certainly not labeled so at the time, the first leveraged buyout may have been the purchase by Malcolm McLean's McLean Industries, Inc. of Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company in January 1955 and Waterman Steamship Corporation in May 1955.On January 21, 1955, McLean Industries, Inc. purchased the capital stock of Pan Atlantic Steamship Corporation and Gulf Florida Terminal Company, Inc. from Waterman Steamship Corporation. In May, McLean Industries, Inc. completed the acquisition of the common stock of Waterman Steamship Corporation from its founders and other stockholders. Under the terms of the transactions, McLean borrowed $42 million and raised an additional $7 million through an issue of preferred stock. When the deal closed, $20 million of Waterman cash and assets were used to retire $20 million of the loan debt. The newly elected board of Waterman then voted to pay an immediate dividend of $25 million to McLean Industries.Marc Levinson, The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger, pp. 44-47 (Princeton Univ. Press 2006). The details of this transaction are set out in ICC Case No. MC-F-5976, McLean Trucking Company and Pan-Atlantic American Steamship Corporation-- Investigation of Control, July 8, 1957. Similar to the approach employed in the McLean transaction, the use of publicly traded holding companies as investment vehicles to acquire portfolios of investments in corporate assets would become a new trend in the 1960s popularized by the likes of Warren Buffett (Berkshire Hathaway) and Victor Posner (DWG Corporation) and later adopted by Nelson Peltz (Triarc), Saul Steinberg (Reliance Insurance) and Gerry Schwartz (Onex Corporation). These investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms. In fact, it is Posner who is often credited with coining the term \\"leveraged buyout\\" or \\"LBO\\"Trehan, R. (2006). The History Of Leveraged Buyouts. December 4, 2006. Accessed May 22, 2008 Posner, who had made a fortune in real estate investments in the 1930s and 1940s acquired a major stake in DWG Corporation in 1966. Having gained control of the company, he used it as an investment vehicle that could execute takeovers of other companies. Posner and DWG are perhaps best known for the hostile takeover of Sharon Steel Corporation in 1969, one of the earliest such takeovers in the United States. Posner's investments were typically motivated by attractive valuations, balance sheets and cash flow characteristics. Because of its high debt load, Posner's DWG would generate attractive but highly volatile returns and would ultimately land the company in financial difficulty. In 1987, Sharon Steel sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Warren Buffett, who is typically described as a stock market investor rather than a private equity investor, employed many of the same techniques in the creation of his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate as Posner's DWG Corporation and in later years by more traditional private equity investors. In 1965, with the support of the company's board of directors, Buffett assumed control of Berkshire Hathaway. At the time of Buffett's investment, Berkshire Hathaway was a textile company, however, Buffett used Berkshire Hathaway as an investment vehicle to make acquisitions and minority investments in dozens of the insurance and reinsurance industries (GEICO) and varied companies including: American Express, The Buffalo News, the Coca-Cola Company, Fruit of the Loom, Nebraska Furniture Mart and See's Candies. Buffett's value investing approach and focus on earnings and cash flows are characteristic of later private equity investors. Buffett would distinguish himself relative to more traditional leveraged buyout practitioners through his reluctance to use leverage and hostile techniques in his investments. The pioneers of private equity Lewis Cullman's acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions.https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-giving-money-away- now-11560714097https://www.newsweek.com/philanthropist-discusses-tsunami- relief-public-versus-private-giving-and-why-parents-should- limithttps://yalealumnimagazine.com/obituaries/4913-lewis-b-cullman-41 However, the industry that is today described as private equity was conceived by several financiers, including Jerome Kohlberg Jr. and later his prot√©g√©, Henry Kravis. Working for Bear Stearns at the time, Kohlberg and Kravis along with Kravis' cousin George Roberts began a series of what they described as \\"bootstrap\\" investments. They targeted family-owned businesses, many of which had been founded in the years following World War II and by the 1960s and 1970s were facing succession issues. Many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors, making a sale to a financial buyer potentially attractive. In the following years, the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971) and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Although they had a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.Barbarians at the Gate, p. 133-136 By 1976, tensions had built up between Bear Stearns and Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts leading to their departure and the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities.In 1976, Kravis was forced to serve as interim CEO of a failing direct mail company Advo. Early investors included the Hillman family.Refers to Henry Hillman and the Hillman Company. The Hillman Company (Answers.com profile) By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising its first institutional fund with approximately $30 million of investor commitments.Barbarians at the Gate, p. 136-140 Meanwhile, in 1974, Thomas H. Lee founded a new investment firm to focus on acquiring companies through leveraged buyout transactions, one of the earliest independent private equity firms to focus on leveraged buyouts of more mature companies rather than venture capital investments in growth companies. Lee's firm, Thomas H. Lee Partners, while initially generating less fanfare than other entrants in the 1980s, would emerge as one of the largest private equity firms globally by the end of the 1990s. The second half of the 1970s and the first years of the 1980s saw the emergence of several private equity firms that would survive through the various cycles both in leveraged buyouts and venture capital. Among the firms founded during these years were: *Cinven, a European buyout firm, founded in 1977; *Forstmann Little & Company one of the largest private equity firms through the end of the 1990s, founded in 1978 by Ted Forstmann, Nick Forstmann and Brian Little; *Clayton, Dubilier & Rice founded as Clayton & Dubilier in 1978; *Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe founded by Pat Welsh, Russ Carson, Bruce Anderson and Richard Stowe in 1979; *Candover, one of the earliest European buyout firms, founded in 1980; and *GTCR and Thoma Cressey ( Golder Thoma & Cressey, later Golder Thoma Cressey & Rauner) founded in 1980 by Stanley Golder, who built the private equity program at First Chicago Corp. that backed Federal Express.\\"Private Equity Pioneer Golder Dies.\\" Buyouts, January 24, 2000. A cached version of the article can be found here. Management buyouts also came into existence in the late 1970s and early 1980s. One of the most notable early management buyout transactions was the acquisition of Harley-Davidson. A group of managers at Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle manufacturer, bought the company from AMF in a leveraged buyout in 1981, but racked up big losses the following year and had to ask for protection from Japanese competitors. Regulatory and tax changes impact the boom The advent of the boom in leveraged buyouts in the 1980s was supported by three major legal and regulatory events: *Failure of the Carter tax plan of 1977 - In his first year in office, Jimmy Carter put forth a revision to the corporate tax system that would have, among other results, reduced the disparity in treatment of interest paid to bondholders and dividends paid to stockholders. Carter's proposals did not achieve support from the business community or Congress and was not enacted. Because of the different tax treatment, the use of leverage to reduce taxes was popular among private equity investors and would become increasingly popular with the reduction of the capital gains tax rate.Saunders, Laura. How The Government Subsidizes Leveraged Takeovers. Forbes, November 28, 1988. * Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) - With the passage of ERISA in 1974, corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in privately held companies. In 1975, fundraising for private equity investments cratered, according to the Venture Capital Institute, totaling only $10 million during the course of the year. In 1978, the US Labor Department relaxed certain of the ERISA restrictions, under the \\"prudent man rule,\\"The \\"prudent man rule\\" is a fiduciary responsibility of investment managers under ERISA. Under the original application, each investment was expected to adhere to risk standards on its own merits, limiting the ability of investment managers to make any investments deemed potentially risky. Under the revised 1978 interpretation, the concept of portfolio diversification of risk, measuring risk at the aggregate portfolio level rather than the investment level to satisfy fiduciary standards would also be accepted. thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in private equity resulting in a major source of capital available to invest in venture capital and other private equity. Time reported in 1978 that fund raising had increased from $39 million in 1977 to $570 million just one year later.Taylor, Alexander L. \\"Boom Time in Venture Capital\\". TIME magazine, August 10, 1981. Additionally, many of these same corporate pension investors would become active buyers of the high yield bonds (or junk bonds) that were necessary to complete leveraged buyout transactions. *Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) - On August 15, 1981, Ronald Reagan signed the Kemp-Roth bill, officially known as the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, into law, lowering of the top capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent, and making high risk investments even more attractive. In the years that would follow these events, private equity would experience its first major boom, acquiring some of the famed brands and major industrial powers of American business. The first private equity boom (1982 to 1993) The decade of the 1980s is perhaps more closely associated with the leveraged buyout than any decade before or since. For the first time, the public became aware of the ability of private equity to affect mainstream companies and \\"corporate raiders\\" and \\"hostile takeovers\\" entered the public consciousness. The decade would see one of the largest booms in private equity culminating in the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which would reign as the largest leveraged buyout transaction for nearly 17 years. In 1980, the private equity industry would raise approximately $2.4 billion of annual investor commitments and by the end of the decade in 1989 that figure stood at $21.9 billion marking the tremendous growth experienced.Source: Thomson Financial's VentureXpert database for Commitments.

Within the broader private equity industry, two distinct sub-industries, leveraged buyouts and venture capital experienced growth along parallel although interrelated tracks. The development of the private equity and venture capital asset classes has occurred through a series of boom and bust cycles since the middle of the 20th century. The 1980s saw the first major boom and bust cycle in private equity. The cycle which is typically marked by the 1982 acquisition of Gibson Greetings and ending just over a decade later was characterized by a dramatic surge in leveraged buyout (LBO) activity financed by junk bonds. The period culminated in the massive buyout of RJR Nabisco before the near collapse of the leveraged buyout industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s marked by the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert and the high-yield debt market. Beginning of the LBO boom Michael Milken, the man credited with creating the market for high yield \\"junk\\" bonds and spurring the LBO boom of the 1980s The beginning of the first boom period in private equity would be marked by the well-publicized success of the Gibson Greetings acquisition in 1982 and would roar ahead through 1983 and 1984 with the soaring stock market driving profitable exits for private equity investors. In January 1982, former US Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon, Ray Chambers and a group of investors, which would later come to be known as Wesray Capital Corporation, acquired Gibson Greetings, a producer of greeting cards. The purchase price for Gibson was $80 million, of which only $1 million was rumored to have been contributed by the investors. By mid-1983, just sixteen months after the original deal, Gibson completed a $290 million IPO and Simon made approximately $66 million.Taylor, Alexander L. \\"Buyout Binge\\". TIME magazine, July 16, 1984. Simon and Wesray would later complete the $71.6 million acquisition of Atlas Van Lines. The success of the Gibson Greetings investment attracted the attention of the wider media to the nascent boom in leveraged buyouts. Between 1979 and 1989, it was estimated that there were over 2,000 leveraged buyouts valued in excess of $250 billionOpler, T. and Titman, S. \\"The determinants of leveraged buyout activity: Free cash flow vs. financial distress costs.\\" Journal of Finance, 1993.

Because of the high leverage on many of the transactions of the 1980s, failed deals occurred regularly, however the promise of attractive returns on successful investments attracted more capital. With the increased leveraged buyout activity and investor interest, the mid-1980s saw a major proliferation of private equity firms.

Coleman Andrews III and Eric Kriss out of the management consulting firm Bain & Company; *Chemical Venture Partners, later Chase Capital Partners and JPMorgan Partners, and today CCMP Capital, founded in 1984, as a captive investment group within Chemical Bank; *Hellman & Friedman founded in 1984; *Hicks & Haas, later Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, and today HM Capital (and its European spinoff Lion Capital), as well as the predecessor of Haas, Wheat & Partners, founded in 1984; *Blackstone Group, one of the largest private equity firms, founded in 1985 by Peter G. Peterson and Stephen A. Schwarzman; *Doughty Hanson, a European focused firm, founded in 1985; *BC Partners, a European focused firm, founded in 1986; and *Carlyle Group founded in 1987 by Stephen L. Norris and David M. Rubenstein. Additionally, as the market developed, new niches within the private equity industry began to emerge. In 1982, Venture Capital Fund of America, the first private equity firm focused on acquiring secondary market interests in existing private equity funds was founded and then, two years later in 1984, First Reserve Corporation, the first private equity firm focused on the energy sector, was founded. Venture capital in the 1980s The public successes of the venture capital industry in the 1970s and early 1980s (e.g., DEC, Apple, Genentech) gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms. From just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade, there were over 650 firms by the end of the 1980s, each searching for the next major \\"home run\\". While the number of firms multiplied, the capital managed by these firms increased only 11% from $28 billion to $31 billion over the course of the decade.POLLACK, ANDREW. \\"Venture Capital Loses Its Vigor.\\" New York Times, October 8, 1989. The growth the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time. In addition to the increased competition among firms, several other factors impacted returns. The market for initial public offerings cooled in the mid-1980s before collapsing after the stock market crash in 1987 and foreign corporations, particularly from Japan and Korea, flooded early stage companies with capital. In response to the changing conditions, corporations that had sponsored in-house venture investment arms, including General Electric and Paine Webber either sold off or closed these venture capital units. Additionally, venture capital units within Chemical Bank (today CCMP Capital), Citicorp (today Court Square Capital Partners and CVC Capital Partners, First Chicago Bank (the predecessor of GTCR and Madison Dearborn Partners) and Continental Illinois National Bank (today CIVC Partners), among others, began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies. Even industry founders J.H. Whitney & Company and Warburg Pincus began to transition toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments.Kurtzman, Joel. \\"PROSPECTS; Venture Capital.\\" New York Times, March 27, 1988.LUECK, THOMAS J. \\"HIGH TECH'S GLAMOUR FADES FOR SOME VENTURE CAPITALISTS .\\" New York Times, February 6, 1987. Many of these venture capital firms attempted to stay close to their areas of expertise in the technology industry by acquiring companies in the industry that had reached certain levels of maturity. In 1989, Prime Computer was acquired in a $1.3 billion leveraged buyout by J.H. Whitney & Company in what would prove to be a disastrous transaction. Whitney's investment in Prime proved to be nearly a total loss with the bulk of the proceeds from the company's liquidation paid to the company's creditors.Norris, Floyd \\"Market Place; Buyout of Prime Computer Limps Toward Completion.\\" New York Times, August 12, 1992 Although lower profile than their buyout counterparts, new leading venture capital firms were also formed including Institutional Venture Partners (IVP) in 1980, Draper Fisher Jurvetson (originally Draper Associates) in 1985 and Canaan Partners in 1987 among others. Corporate raiders, hostile takeovers and greenmail Although the \\"corporate raider\\" moniker is rarely applied to contemporary private equity investors, there is no formal distinction between a \\"corporate raid\\" and other private equity investments acquisitions of existing businesses. The label was typically ascribed by constituencies within the acquired company or the media. However, a corporate raid would typically feature a leveraged buyout that would involve a hostile takeover of the company, perceived asset stripping, major layoffs or other significant corporate restructuring activities. Management of many large publicly traded corporations reacted negatively to the threat of potential hostile takeover or corporate raid and pursued drastic defensive measures including poison pills, golden parachutes and increasing debt levels on the company's balance sheet. Additionally, the threat of the corporate raid would lead to the practice of \\"greenmail\\", where a corporate raider or other party would acquire a significant stake in the stock of a company and receive an incentive payment (effectively a bribe) from the company in order to avoid pursuing a hostile takeover of the company. Greenmail represented a transfer payment from a company's existing shareholders to a third-party investor and provided no value to existing shareholders but did benefit existing managers. The practice of greenmail is not typically considered a tactic of private equity investors and is not condoned by market participants. Among the most notable corporate raiders of the 1980s were Carl Icahn, Victor Posner, Nelson Peltz, Robert M. Bass, T. Boone Pickens, Harold Clark Simmons, Kirk Kerkorian, Sir James Goldsmith, Saul Steinberg and Asher Edelman. Icahn developed a reputation as a ruthless corporate raider after his hostile takeover of TWA in 1985.10 Questions for Carl Icahn by Barbara Kiviat, TIME magazine, February 15, 2007 The result of that takeover was Icahn systematically selling TWA's assets to repay the debt he used to purchase the company, which was described as asset stripping.TWA - Death Of A Legend by Elaine X. Grant, St Louis Magazine, October 2005 In later years, many of the corporate raiders would be re-characterized as \\"Activist shareholders\\". Many of the corporate raiders were onetime clients of Michael Milken, whose investment banking firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, helped raise blind pools of capital with which corporate raiders could make a legitimate attempt to take over a company and provided high-yield debt financing of the buyouts. Drexel Burnham raised a $100 million blind pool in 1984 for Peltz and his holding company Triangle Industries (later Triarc) to give credibility for takeovers, representing the first major blind pool raised for this purpose. Two years later, in 1986, Wickes Companies, a holding company run by Sanford C. Sigoloff, raised a $1.2 billion blind pool.Bruck, Connie. The Predators' Ball. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988. p. 117‚Äì118 In 1985, Milken raised $750 million for a similar blind pool for Ronald Perelman which would ultimately prove instrumental in acquiring his biggest target: The Revlon Corporation. In 1980, Ronald Perelman, the son of a wealthy Philadelphia businessman, and future \\"corporate raider\\" having made several small but successful buyouts, acquired MacAndrews & Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate, that Perelman's father had tried and failed to acquire 10 years earlier. Perelman would ultimately divest the company's core business and use MacAndrews & Forbes as a holding company investment vehicle for subsequent leveraged buyouts including Technicolor, Inc., Pantry Pride and Revlon. Using the Pantry Pride subsidiary of his holding company MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Perelman's overtures were rebuffed. Repeatedly rejected by the company's board and management, Perelman continued to press forward with a hostile takeover, raising his offer from an initial bid of $47.50 per share until it reached $53.00 per share. After receiving a higher offer from a white knight, private equity firm Forstmann Little & Company, Perelman's Pantry Pride made a successful bid for Revlon, valuing the company at $2.7 billion. The buyout proved troubling, burdened by a heavy debt load. Under Perelman's control, Revlon sold four divisions: two of them were sold for $1 billion, its vision care division was sold for $574 million, and its National Health Laboratories division was spun out to the public market in 1988. Revlon also made acquisitions including Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989, later selling them to Procter & Gamble in 1991. Perelman exited the bulk of his holdings in Revlon through an IPO in 1996 and subsequent sales of stock. As of December 31, 2007, Perelman still retains a minority ownership interest in Revlon. The Revlon takeover, because of its well-known brand, was profiled widely by the media and brought new attention to the emerging boom in leveraged buyout activity. In later years, Milken and Drexel would shy away from certain of the more \\"notorious\\" corporate raiders as Drexel and the private equity industry attempted to move upscale. RJR Nabisco and the Barbarians at the Gate Leveraged buyouts in the 1980s including Perelman's takeover of Revlon came to epitomize the \\"ruthless capitalism\\" and \\"greed\\" popularly seen to be pervading Wall Street at the time. One of the final major buyouts of the 1980s proved to be its most ambitious and marked both a high- water mark and a sign of the beginning of the end of the boom that had begun nearly a decade earlier. In 1989, KKR closed on a $31.1 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco. It was, at that time and for over 17 years, the largest leverage buyout in history. The event was chronicled in the book, Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, and later made into a television movie starring James Garner. F. Ross Johnson was the President and CEO of RJR Nabisco at the time of the leveraged buyout and Henry Kravis was a general partner at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The leveraged buyout was in the amount of $25 billion (plus assumed debt), and the battle for control took place in October and November 1988. KKR would eventually prevail in acquiring RJR Nabisco at $109 per share marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton would take RJR Nabisco private at $75 per share. A fierce series of negotiations and horse-trading ensued which pitted KKR against Shearson Lehman Hutton and later Forstmann Little & Co. Many of the major banking players of the day, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties. After Shearson Lehman's original bid, KKR quickly introduced a tender offer to obtain RJR Nabisco for $90 per share‚Äîa price that enabled it to proceed without the approval of RJR Nabisco's management. RJR's management team, working with Shearson Lehman and Salomon Brothers, submitted a bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis's team. KKR's final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco. KKR's offer was guaranteed, whereas the management offer (backed by Shearson Lehman and Salomon) lacked a \\"reset\\", meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated $112 per share. Additionally, many in RJR's board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of Ross Johnson' unprecedented golden parachute deal. TIME magazine featured Ross Johnson on the cover of their December 1988 issue along with the headline, \\"A Game of Greed: This man could pocket $100 million from the largest corporate takeover in history. Has the buyout craze gone too far?\\".Game of Greed (TIME magazine, 1988) KKR's offer was welcomed by the board, and, to some observers, it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a deal-breaker in KKR's favor was little more than an excuse to reject Ross Johnson's higher payout of $112 per share. F. Ross Johnson received $53 million from the buyout. At $31.1 billion of transaction value, RJR Nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyouts in history. In 2006 and 2007, a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed that for the first time surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006 ‚Äì 2007 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. Unfortunately for KKR, size would not equate with success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden the performance of the investment. Two years earlier, in 1987, Jerome Kohlberg, Jr. resigned from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. over differences in strategy. Kohlberg did not favor the larger buyouts (including Beatrice Companies (1985) and Safeway (1986) and would later likely have included the 1989 takeover of RJR Nabisco), highly leveraged transactions or hostile takeovers being pursued increasingly by KKR.STERNGOLD, JAMES. \\"BUYOUT PIONEER QUITTING FRAY.\\" New York Times, June 19, 1987. The split would ultimately prove acrimonious as Kohlberg sued Kravis and Roberts for what he alleged were improper business tactics. The case was later settled out of court.BARTLETT, SARAH. \\"Kohlberg In Dispute Over Firm.\\" New York Times, August 30, 1989 Instead, Kohlberg chose to return to his roots, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies and in 1987, he would found a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company along with his son James A. Kohlberg, at the time a KKR executive. Jerome Kohlberg would continue investing successfully for another seven years before retiring from Kohlberg & Company in 1994 and turning his firm over to his son.ANTILLA, SUSAN. \\"Wall Street; A Scion of the L.B.O. Reflects.\\" New York Times, April 24, 1994 As the market reached its peak in 1988 and 1989, new private equity firms were founded which would emerge as major investors in the years to follow, including: *Code Hennessy & Simmons, a middle market private equity firm, founded in 1988; *Coller Capital, the first European secondaries firm specializing in the purchase of existing private equity interests, founded in 1989; *Landmark Partners, an early secondaries firm specializing in the purchase of existing private equity interests, founded in 1989; *Leonard Green & Partners founded in 1989 a successor to Gibbons, Green van Amerongen (founded 1969), a merchant banking firm that completed several early management buyout transactions;Bartlett, Sarah. \\"Wall Street's Treacherous Side.\\" New York Times, November 6, 1989.Bartlett, Sarah. \\"Filing Discloses Dispute Over Sale of Sheller-Globe.\\" New York Times, October 13, 1989.\\"Gibbons, Green Separation.\\" New York Times, May 5, 1989. and *Providence Equity Partners, a media-focused firm, founded in 1989. LBO bust (1990 to 1992) By the end of the 1980s the excesses of the buyout market were beginning to show, with the bankruptcy of several large buyouts including Robert Campeau's 1988 buyout of Federated Department Stores, the 1986 buyout of the Revco drug stores, Walter Industries, FEB Trucking and Eaton Leonard. Additionally, the RJR Nabisco deal was showing signs of strain, leading to a recapitalization in 1990 that involved the contribution of $1.7 billion of new equity from KKR.Wallace, Anise C. \\"Nabisco Refinance Plan Set.\\" The New York Times, July 16, 1990. Additionally, in response to the threat of unwelcome LBOs, certain companies adopted a number of techniques, such as the poison pill, to protect them against hostile takeovers by effectively self- destructing the company if it were to be taken over. Contemporary reflections of private equity=1980s reflections of private equity Although private equity rarely received a thorough treatment in popular culture, several films did feature stereotypical \\"corporate raiders\\" prominently. Among the most notable examples of private equity featured in motion pictures included: * Wall Street (1987) ‚Äì The notorious \\"corporate raider\\" and \\"greenmailer\\" Gordon Gekko represents a synthesis of the worst features of various famous private equity figures intends to manipulate an ambitious young stockbroker to takeover failing but decent airline. Although Gekko makes a pretense of caring about the airline, his intentions prove to be to destroy the airline, strip its assets and lay off its employees before raiding the corporate pension fund. Gekko would become a symbol in popular culture for unrestrained greed (with the signature line, \\"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good\\") that would be attached to the private equity industry. * Other People's Money (1991) ‚Äì A self-absorbed corporate raider \\"Larry the Liquidator\\" (Danny DeVito), sets his sights on New England Wire and Cable, a small-town business run by family patriarch Gregory Peck who is principally interested in protecting his employees and the town. * Pretty Woman (1990) ‚Äì Although Richard Gere's profession is incidental to the plot, the selection of the corporate raider who intends to destroy the hard work of a family-run business by acquiring the company in a hostile takeover and then sell off the company's parts for a profit (compared in the movie to an illegal chop shop). Ultimately, the corporate raider is won over and chooses not to pursue his original plans for the company.

It is part of \\"The Firs\\", a Christian camp and retreat ministry that is in good standing with the Christian Camp and Conference Association. Overview=History Camp Firwood was founded by Otis and Julia Whipple, who gathered 35 people for a five-day retreat at their property overlooking Lake Whatcom in July 1921. This was the start of what would become a multi-site, multi-program organization now called \\"The Firs\\". In 1954, a group of 30 Junior High campers paddling on Lake Whatcom landed on a camp site which they called \\"White Sands\\". With the permission of the property owner, the first week-long resident camp took place on this property, which soon become known as Camp Firwood. In 1955, Camp Firwood was purchased for $35,000. Today, Camp Firwood runs ten weeks of camp for youth 7‚Äì18 years of age, and houses up to 260 campers a week. The camp now encompasses of beautiful forest, of waterfront, and its own private island. They host day camps and resident camps, both of which are co-ed. In 2010, they opened a new dining hall, dubbed the Centerhouse, to more adequately accommodate the growing number of campers. Also in 2010, the camp finished in the Top 5 for \\"Best Fun Place for Kids in Western Washington\\" by King5's Evening Magazine. In June 2019 Camp Firwood made the news for firing Jace Taylor as a counselor at Fircreek Day Camp for being gay. The decision was made after a camp leader came across Taylor's profile picture on Facebook which showed him with his boyfriend. The camp released a statement that corroborated Taylor's assertion that he had been fired on the basis of his sexuality saying, \\"It became evident in the hiring process that he did not personally align with our Doctrinal Statement (regarding sexuality in particular). In this case, in order to be consistent to our Mission and Doctrinal Statement, we unfortunately had to withdraw our invitation to this young man, who we truly like, for this summer staff role.\\" Taylor had been a former camper, as well as his mother and her mother before her. This controversy led to The Opportunity Council terminating its more than 25-year-long kitchen lease with The Firs. The lease provided Opportunity Council with a fully equipped, commercially licensed kitchen, which would be used to provide meals for children in Head Start and Early Childhood Assistance and Education preschools throughout Whatcom County. The lease paralleled the school year, which complemented The Firs‚Äô busiest schedule of meal production in late spring to early fall. Cancellations as of Friday, June 21, represent a loss of 4-7% of registrations. Activities Although its main attractions are at the waterfront, Camp Firwood also hosts a variety of other activities including paintball, arts and crafts, a 10-stage high ropes challenge course, a climbing center, archery range, soccer field, basketball court, skateboard ramps, and a beach volleyball court. Water activities include a swimming beach, two aqua jump trampolines, an aqua swing, kayaking, canoeing, sailing, waterskiing, wakeboarding, and tubing.

As the leading statewide voice for parks, Parks & Trails New York launched its Campaign for Parks in 2006 with the release of a highly acclaimed report, Parks at a Turning Point ‚Äì Restoring and enhancing New York‚Äôs state park system, which first raised the alarm that New York's park facilities and infrastructure were aging and deteriorating. PTNY's subsequent report, The NYS Park System: An Economic Asset to the Empire State, served as the foundation for its aggressive grassroots organizing and activation of grassroots park Friends groups, which convinced the New York State Legislature to keep parks open in 2010 in the face of draconian proposed budget cuts. To improve and enhance New York's parks and historic sites and bring visibility to the entire park system and its needs, PTNY launched the annual I Love My Park Day, in which volunteers from across the state participate in cleanup, improvement, and beautification events at New York State parks and historic sites. In collaboration with New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP) this event will run on a statewide level, providing outreach, promotion, technical assistance and how-to organizer's kits for friends groups to use for their individual events. Friends groups and park staff will oversee cleanup, improvement and beautification projects and work with volunteers. The first annual I Love My Park Day was held on May 5, 2012, where thousands of volunteers, including NYS Governor Andrew Cuomo, helped carry out site improvement projects at more than 40 state parks. In addition, PTNY continues to connect with local friends groups to create a state-wide network of park advocates and supporters. The You Gotta Have Friends newsletter gives updates about parks throughout the state and is designed for friends of the NYS park system. Another of Parks & Trails New York's priority initiatives is the development and promotion of a statewide network of multi-use trails. As part of this effort, under its Healthy Trails, Healthy People program, PTNY has worked with hundreds of local groups and municipalities interested in creating, supporting, and promoting local multi-use trails. PTNY also founded and spearheads the Statewide Trails Coalition, which advocates for increased funding and supportive public policies for community trails and the statewide trails network. As part of its technical assistance to grassroots park and trail groups, PTNY's Growing the Grassroots program provides capacity-building grants to groups interested in strengthening their outreach, communications, membership development, or fundraising. Since 1998, Parks & Trails New York has been working in partnership with the New York State Canal Corporation to help communities along the 524-mile NYS Canal System organize, plan, and develop the Canalway Trail and to build awareness of the Erie Canal corridor as a premier destination for bicyclists and other outdoor enthusiasts. A new report from PTNY and the Canalway Trails Association New York (CTANY), Closing the Gaps: A Progress Report on the Erie Canalway Trail, cites the progress being made to close the five remaining gaps in the 365-mile canalway trail. PTNY's campaign to Close the Gaps, endorsed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in the fall of 2010, has generated dramatically renewed interest in completing the trail among citizens, community leaders, and elected officials at all levels of government. Also, PTNY publishes a Canalway Trail Times newsletter, giving updates and information surrounding the Canalway Trail. In addition to organizing and supporting local park and trail groups through workshops and other targeted technical assistance, Parks & Trails New York provides an interactive Erie Canalway Trail web site experience at Cycle the Erie Canal. This website provides a comprehensive guide to the cross-state Erie Canalway Trail with maps, lodging, attractions, historic sites, bike shops and more. Also available on Parks & Trails New York's website is a guide to more than 110 trails in New York State; as well as alerts, updates and other essential information for parks and trail users and activists, including electronic and print newsletters (Parks & Trails E-NEWS and GreenSpace). Bike Tours PTNY sponsors an annual eight-day cross-state bicycle tour along the Erie Canal and publishes a popular guidebook, Cycling the Erie Canal, available on-line and in hard copy. PTNY also sponsors an annual six-day bicycle tour of the historic Hudson Valley, starting in Albany and ending in New York City. In 2012, the first edition of Cycling the Hudson Valley was published. This guide to history, art, and nature on the East and West sides of the majestic Hudson River is also available on-line and in hard copy.

The album's first single, \\"Save Me,\\" was released July 15, 2008. It is currently available for sale digitally at all major online retailers (iTunes, Amazon, Rhapsody, etc.). The song impacted radio only one day earlier on the 14th with a total of 11 adds at radio and climbing to 25 within a few days. Merovingian Music (abrv MRV) has released two web sites to accompany and promote the new single \\"Save Me.\\" The first is an interactive e-card which provides to anyone that may be unfamiliar, an excellent introduction to the band. The second is a media packed web tools site for those who want to take action and promote. This site provides to the public a plethora of marketing tools and the necessary knowledge to use them effectively. In October 2008 the band's label released the first video single for the song, \\"Save Me.\\" To coincide with the videos release, ThePuppetVideo.com was put in place to view the video and help raise awareness. The video features a protagonist puppet used to explore the band's tormented psyche and shows the devolution and decline of the human condition when all hope is lost. A masked man in stop-motion symbolizes the character in a state of emotional decay and turmoil as he morphs into an actual puppet who is void of feeling, emotion and life itself, thus symbolizing that the fight is over and that he has lost all resemblance to his former self and has now become completely dehumanized. The album was promoted by 97.5 The Blaze, a radio station in Salt Lake City under the call sign KZZQ (formerly KHTB). Also, the songs \\"Devils & Angels\\" and \\"Here They Come\\" were originally released on the band's previous album, After the Chaos II. In addition to those two tracks, the song \\"Brave\\" was also re-recorded for the album, but didn't make it.

It is named after the spa town of Marienbad (now Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ) where Goethe, 73 years old, spent the summer of 1821. There he fell in love with the 17-year-old Ulrike von Levetzow. Goethe returned to Marienbad in the summer of 1823 to celebrate his birthday. On that occasion, he asked Ulrike, via his friend, Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, to marry him. She declined. Analysis Ulrike von Levetzow, 1821 This poem, considered one of Goethe's finest and most personal,Goethe reflects the devastating sadness the poet felt when his proposal for marriage was declined. He started writing the poem on 5 September 1823 in a coach which carried him from Eger (now Cheb) to Weimar and by his arrival on 12 September, it was finished. He showed it only to his closest friends.Goethe's third summer, in Czech (\\"Ulrika von Levetzowov√°\\" (in Czech) may be a replacement) Mir ist das All, ich bin mir selbst verloren, Der ich noch erst den G√∂ttern Liebling war; Sie pr√ºften mich, verliehen mir Pandoren, So reich an G√ºtern, reicher an Gefahr; Sie dr√§ngten mich zum gabeseligen Munde, Sie trennen mich, und richten mich zugrunde. To me is all, I to myself am lost, Who the immortals' fav'rite erst was thought; They, tempting, sent Pandoras to my cost, So rich in wealth, with danger far more fraught; They urged me to those lips, with rapture crown'd, Deserted me, and hurl'd me to the ground.\\"Marienbad Elegy\\", final stanza, translated by Edgar Alfred Bowring Goethe never returned to Bohemia.

Gordon, Ph.D., is an economist and author, and is the president and chief executive officer of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority (FCEDA) in Fairfax County, Virginia, a position he has held since late 1983. In 2016, Virginia Business magazine named Gordon one of its \\"50 most influential Virginians.\\" He was named to the same list in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In 2015, Dr. Gordon was honored by International Economic Development Council with the Jeffrey A. Finkle Organizational Leadership Award for a ‚Äúlasting commitment to the field of economic development.‚Äù  Career  Prior to joining the FCEDA, Gordon held positions with Arlington County, Virginia and the United States Department of Labor. Gordon has taught at the University of Maryland, College Park, George Mason University, and Virginia Commonwealth University. He has consulted with city and state governments throughout the United States and internationally. He has also served as a consultant to businesses, non-profit organizations, associations, colleges and universities, various government agencies including the United States Navy and the United Nations. Gordon holds a bachelor's degree from The Citadel, a master's degree from George Washington University, and a doctorate in International Economics from the Catholic University of America. He is the author of numerous articles on strategic planning, economic development, leadership styles, and other management topics. Gordon was awarded a Fulbright Award for study in Scotland, where he made a series of recommendations on how to maintain and develop skilled employment in the region, and the approaches to doing so to secure its economic future when a nuclear power plant closes. He planned to further explore the region‚Äôs huge potential for renewable energy but also come up with specific ways to implement inward investment into the northern Highland region.  Publishing  Gordon is the author of 13 books. His most recent, The Economic Survival of America's Isolated Small Towns, from CRC Press (2015), \\"provides a detailed discussion of the context of these towns, from the internal challenges that isolate them and force independent action to the extent to which they can rely on neighboring or other macro-level resources.\\" The book is the fourth in a series penned by Gordon and published by CRC Press. In 2013, Gordon published The Economic Viability of Micropolitan America, which \\"highlights cities and towns from Bangor, Maine, to Walla Walla, Washington to provide case studies on their economic past and future, illustrate dramatic shifts in the roles they play in larger economies, and address questions asked by these communities as they face an uncertain future.\\" In 2018, Gordon's latest work (\\"Understanding Community Economic Growth and Decline\\") was published by Routledge Press in New York. This work discusses means by which local communities can accelerate their pace of economic development or redevelopment. Reinventing Local and Regional Economies, published by CRC Press (2011), ‚Äúdelineates the dos and don‚Äôts to observe in order to sustain economic vitality in any community.‚Äù The book examines the factors that led to the decline of some American cities after the loss of a major employer or industry by combining available research with more than 70 interviews of mayors, economic development leaders and others who lived and worked through the experience around the United States. In 2009, Gordon published The Formula for Economic Growth on Main Street America, also by CRC Press. The book is part of CRC's American Society for Public Administration series designed to increase national and international interest for topics in public administration. The Formula for Economic Growth on Main Street America draws on Dr. Gordon's experience at the FCEDA and his involvement in assisting communities around the world. Dr. Alan Merten, former president of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, called the book \\"a comprehensive, analytic, and clear look at the importance and complexity of economic growth...an important read for both the expert and the student.\\" In August 2010, Dr. Gordon appeared on the Fox Business Network providing advice on how a community can achieve a robust economic development program. Gordon has contributed opinion pieces to a range of publications, including Forbes, The Washington Post, and American City and County (an economic development trade publication).  Community involvement  On April 23, 2010, Virginia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (VAHCC) presented a Bridge Builder Award to Dr. Gordon, at the VAHCC annual gala in Richmond. The chamber's Bridge Builder Awards honor those who forge connections among Virginia‚Äôs diverse racial, ethnic, religious and cultural groups. Former recipients of Bridge Builder Awards include former Mexico President Vicente Fox, and U.S. Sen. (and former Virginia governor) Mark Warner. The Fairfax Symphony Orchestra (FSO) presented Dr. Gordon, in June 2010, with a Dorothy Farnham Feuer Award. The Feuer Award, named for the orchestra's founder, recognizes an individual whose personal involvement and commitment significantly aided the FSO. Dr. Gordon received the award June 15 at the annual meeting of the FSO board of directors. Dr. Gordon is a past president of the board. During his tenure, he oversaw the FSO‚Äôs 50th anniversary season and the search for a replacement of long-time music director William Hudson and made it a priority to diversify the FSO's board of directors to reflect the Fairfax County community. Gordon chaired the Arts Council of Fairfax County board between 2011 and 2013. On June 11, 2013, the FCEDA announced that Dr. Gordon has been named chairman of The Foundation for Fairfax County Public Schools. He chaired that board until July 2016. In July 2015 he also assumed chairmanship of the advisory board of the George Mason University Honors College.  Awards and honors  In June 2010, Dr. Gordon received the James M. Rees Award for distinguished community service from the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce. Recipients are selected by the past chairmen of the chamber for their contributions to the local non-profit and business communities and to the chamber. The award honors the late James M. Rees, the 1982-83 chairman of the chamber and a member of the FCEDA Commission in the 1980s. In December 2010, Gordon was named 2010 Virginia Business Person of the Year by Virginia Business magazine, which cited his role in helping attract major business headquarters to Fairfax County as a key factor in their decision. Virginia Business also named him one of its ‚Äú50 most influential Virginians‚Äù list in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. In November 2016, the ‚ÄúProfiles in Success‚Äù series compiled by Fairfax County businessman Gordon J. Bernhardt included a biography of Dr. Gordon.  Public speaking  In spring 2012, Dr. Gordon presented at the ICMA Regional Summit for professional development sessions, ‚ÄúMain Street America: Economic Development Lessons Learned and the Role of the Professional Manager,\\" on March 15 (Decatur, Ga.) March 29 (Columbus, Ohio) April 12 (State College, Pa.) and May 3 (Oklahoma City, Okla.). Dr. Gordon shared the lessons on how to reinvent local and regional economies in the wake of long-term economic decline and more recent global economic trends. In Sept. 2012, the FCEDA presented a symposium titled America‚Äôs Aging Workforce, which featured talks from industry and government leaders from the Washington, D.C., area and beyond on a variety of topics related to issues and opportunities presented by demographic shifts in the U.S. workforce. Gordon subsequently published a commentary in the Richmond Times-Dispatch reflecting data and viewpoints presented at the conference.

He is known for his development of concept mapping in the 1970s.  Biography  Joseph Novak received a B.S. in Science and Mathematics in 1952 from the University of Minnesota, an M.S. in Science Education in 1954 from the University of Minnesota, and completed his graduate studies in Science Education & Biology at the University of Minnesota in 1958. Novak started teaching biology at Kansas State Teachers College at Emporia from 1957 to 1959, and biology and teacher education courses at Purdue University from 1959 to 1967. From 1967 to 1995, he was Professor of Education and Biological sciences at Cornell University. Since 1998 he has also been Visiting Senior Scientist, at the University of West Florida, Institute for Human & Machine Cognition. He has consulted with more than 400 schools, universities, and corporations, including recent work with Procter and Gamble, NASA, the Department of the Navy, and EPRI.Joseph D. Novak. IHMC Senior Research Scientist, 2004. Retrieved 30 July 2009. He has received a number of awards and honors including: a 1998 Honorary Doctorate from The University of Comahue, Neuqu√©n, Argentina; a 2002 Honorary Doctorate from the Public University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; a 2006 Honorary Doctorate from the University of Urbino; and the first award for contributions to science education from the Council of Scientific Society Presidents.  Work  Novak's research focused on human learning, educational studies, and knowledge creation and representation. He has developed a theory of education to guide research and instruction, first published in 1977 and updated in 1998. His latest research work includes studies on students' ideas on learning and epistemology, and methods of applying educational ideas and tools (such as concept mapping) in corporate settings and distance learning programs. Present work includes the development of \\"expert\\" concept maps to \\"scaffold\\" learning, using CMapping with Internet and other resources, providing A New Model for Education.  Concept mapping  Example of a concept map, created using IHMC CmapTools. Beginning in the 1970s, Novak and his research team at Cornell developed the technique of concept mapping as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students. It has subsequently been used as a tool to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. Concept maps have their origin in the learning movement called constructivism. Educational constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge. In his book, Learning How to Learn, Novak states that \\"meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures.\\" In his research, Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as \\"What is water?\\" and \\"What causes the seasons?\\" Novak's work is based on the assimilation theory of cognitivist David Ausubel, who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn new concepts. :\\"The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly.\\"Ausubel, D. (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View. Holt, Rinehart & Winston, New York. In his work, Novak presents concept mapping as a valuable tool for educators in assessing the structure of student conceptions, both before and after an educational experience.  Publications  Novak is author or coauthor of 27 books and more than 130 book chapters and papers in professional books and journals, among them: * 1970. The improvement of biology teaching.

He has also played in Argentina for Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata and Newell's Old Boys. His older brother Andr√©s Scotti currently plays in Uruguay for Nacional de Montevideo. He primarily played as a defensive midfielder but could also play as a centre back. Club career Scotti began his career at Nacional de Montevideo in 1998, winning the league title two years later. In January 2001, he was transferred to Gimnasia La Plata of Argentina. Scotti completed his move to Tianjin Teda for play in the Chinese Super League. After of his pass for China, he returned to Nacional in December 2003, once returning, now to Gimnasia. In 2005, he was transferred to Olimpia, remaining him until 2006, for shortly after signed for Montevideo Wanderers. Audax and Newell's In January 2007, Scotti joined Audax Italiano, signing a one-year contract. His Audax debut came on 28 January against Cobresal, playing the 90 minutes in a 2‚Äì1 victory. Scotti's first goals in the team was scored on a twice against Santiago Wanderers. He and his teammates achieved a very good football level under the coach Raul Toro, finishing thirds in positions table. In the next semester, he had many protagonism in the team, playing all matches, scoring goals and exhibing good skills. His Audax performances, made that he was signed by Newell's Old Boys in January 2008, returning of this form to Argentina, after of play for Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata. However, he only played 14 games and in 2009, he was released of the club. Shortly after, Scotti signed for Racing de Montevideo.

This system is of significance as it is, for certain values of the force constant defining the harmonic containment, an exactly solvable ground-state many-electron problem that explicitly includes electron correlation. As such it can provide insight into quantum correlation (albeit in the presence of a non-physical nuclear potential) and can act as a test system for judging the accuracy of approximate quantum chemical methods for solving the Schr√∂dinger equation. The name \\"Hooke's atom\\" arises because the harmonic potential used to describe the electron-nucleus interaction is a consequence of Hooke's law. Definition Employing atomic units, the Hamiltonian defining the Hooke's atom is :\\\\hat{H} = -\\\\frac{1}{2} abla^{2}_{1} -\\\\frac{1}{2} abla^{2}_{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2}k(r^{2}_{1}+r^{2}_{2}) + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\\\mathbf{r}_{2}}. As written, the first two terms are the kinetic energy operators of the two electrons, the third term is the harmonic electron-nucleus potential, and the final term the electron-electron interaction potential. The non-relativistic Hamiltonian of the helium atom differs only in the replacement: :-\\\\frac{2}{r} \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{2}kr^{2}. Solution The equation to be solved is the two electron Schr√∂dinger equation: :\\\\hat{H}\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_{1},\\\\mathbf{r}_{2}) = E\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_{1},\\\\mathbf{r}_{2}). For arbitrary values of the force constant, k, the Schr√∂dinger equation does not have an analytic solution. However, for a countably infinite number of values, such as k=¬º, simple closed form solutions can be derived. Given the artificial nature of the system this restriction does not hinder the usefulness of the solution. To solve, the system is first transformed from the Cartesian electronic coordinates, (r1,r2), to the center of mass coordinates, (R,u), defined as :\\\\mathbf{R}=\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}+\\\\mathbf{r}_{2}), \\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\mathbf{r}_{2}-\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}. Under this transformation, the Hamiltonian becomes separable ‚Äì that is, the r1  r2 term coupling the two electrons is removed (and not replaced by some other form) allowing the general separation of variables technique to be applied to further a solution for the wave function in the form \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_{1},\\\\mathbf{r}_{2})=\\\\chi(\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{u}). The original Schr√∂dinger equation is then replaced by: :\\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{4} abla^{2}_{\\\\mathbf{R}}+kR^{2} \\\\right)\\\\chi(\\\\mathbf{R}) = E_{\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\chi(\\\\mathbf{R}), :\\\\left( - abla^{2}_{\\\\mathbf{u}}+\\\\frac{1}{4}ku^{2} +\\\\frac{1}{u}\\\\right)\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{u}) = E_{\\\\mathbf{u}}\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{u}). The first equation for \\\\chi(\\\\mathbf{R}) is the Schr√∂dinger equation for an isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator with ground-state energy E_{\\\\mathbf{R}}=(3/2)\\\\sqrt{k} E_{\\\\mathrm{h}} and (unnormalized) wave function :\\\\chi(\\\\mathbf{R}) = e^{-\\\\sqrt{k}R^{2}}. Asymptotically, the second equation again behaves as a harmonic oscillator of the form \\\\exp(-(\\\\sqrt{k}/4)u^{2})\\\\, and the rotationally invariant ground state can be expressed, in general, as \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{u})=f(u)\\\\exp(-(\\\\sqrt{k}/4)u^{2})\\\\, for some function f(u)\\\\,. It was long noted that f(u) is very well approximated by a linear function in u. Thirty years after the proposal of the model an exact solution was discovered for k=¬º, and it was seen that f(u)=1+u/2. It was later shown that there are many values of k which lead to an exact solution for the ground state, as will be shown in the following. Decomposing \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{u})=R_{l}(u)Y_{lm} and expressing the Laplacian in spherical coordinates, :\\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{u^{2}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u}\\\\left(u^{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\hat{L}^{2}}{u^{2}} +\\\\frac{1}{4}ku^{2} +\\\\frac{1}{u}\\\\right)R_{l}(u)Y_{lm}(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{u}}) = E_{l}R_{l}(u)Y_{lm}(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{u}}), one further decomposes the radial wave function as R_{l}(u)=S_{l}(u)/u\\\\, which removes the first derivative to yield :-\\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2}S_{l}(u)}{\\\\partial u^{2}}+\\\\left(\\\\frac{l(l+1)}{u^{2}}+\\\\frac{1}{4}ku^{2}+\\\\frac{1}{u}\\\\right)S_{l}(u) = E_{l}S_{l}(u). The asymptotic behavior S_{l}(u) \\\\sim e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{k}}{4}u^{2}}\\\\, encourages a solution of the form :S_{l}(u) = e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{k}}{4}u^{2}}T_{l}(u). The differential equation satisfied by T_{l}(u)\\\\, is :-\\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2}T_{l}(u)}{\\\\partial u^{2}} + \\\\sqrt{k}u\\\\frac{\\\\partial T_{l}(u)}{\\\\partial u} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{l(l+1)}{u^{2}}+\\\\frac{1}{u}+\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{k}}{2}-E_{l}\\\\right)\\\\right)T_{l}(u) = 0. This equation lends itself to a solution by way of the Frobenius method. That is, T_{l}(u)\\\\, is expressed as :T_{l}(u) = u^{m}\\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\ a_{k}u^{k}. for some m\\\\, and \\\\\\\\{a_{k}\\\\\\\\}_{k=0}^{k=\\\\infty}\\\\, which satisfy: :m(m-1) = l(l+1)\\\\,, :a_{0} eq 0\\\\, :a_{1} = \\\\frac{a_{0}}{2(l+1)}, :a_{2} = \\\\frac{a_{1} + \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{k}(l+\\\\frac{3}{2})-E_{l}\\\\right)a_{0}}{2(2l+3)} = \\\\frac{a_{0}}{2(2l+3)}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2(l+1)}+\\\\sqrt{k}\\\\left(l+\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\right)-E_{l}\\\\right), :a_{3} = \\\\frac{a_{2} + \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{k}(l+\\\\frac{5}{2})-E_{l}\\\\right)a_{1}}{6(l+2)}, :a_{n+1} = \\\\frac{a_{n} + \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{k}(l+\\\\frac{1}{2}+n)-E_{l}\\\\right)a_{n-1}}{(n+1)(2l+2+n)}. The two solutions to the indicial equation are m = l+1 and m = -l of which the former is taken as it yields the regular (bounded, normalizable) wave function. For a simple solution to exist, the infinite series is sought to terminate and it is here where particular values of k are exploited for an exact closed-form solution. Terminating the polynomial at any particular order can be accomplished with different values of k defining the Hamiltonian. As such there exists an infinite number of systems, differing only in the strength of the harmonic containment, with exact ground-state solutions. Most simply, to impose ak = 0 for k ‚â• 2, two conditions must be satisfied: ::\\\\frac{1}{2(l+1)}+\\\\sqrt{k}\\\\left(l+\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\right)-E_{l} = 0, ::\\\\sqrt{k}(l+\\\\frac{5}{2})=E_{l}. These directly force a2 = 0 and a3 = 0 respectively, and as a consequence of the three term recession, all higher coefficients also vanish. Solving for \\\\sqrt{k}\\\\, and E_{l}\\\\, yields :\\\\sqrt{k} = \\\\frac{1}{2(l+1)}, :E_{l} = \\\\frac{2l+5}{4(l+1)}, and the radial wave function :T_{l} = u^{l+1}\\\\left(a_{0}+\\\\frac{a_{0}}{2(l+1)}u\\\\right). Transforming back to R_{l}(u)\\\\, :R_{l}(u) = \\\\frac{T_{l}(u)e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{k}}{4}u^{2}}}{u} = u^{l}\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{1}{2(l+1)}u\\\\right)e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{k}}{4}u^{2}}, the ground- state (with l=0\\\\, and energy 5/4 E_{\\\\mathrm{h}}\\\\,) is finally :\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{u}) = \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{u}{2}\\\\right)e^{-u^{2}/8}. Combining, normalizing, and transforming back to the original coordinates yields the ground state wave function: :\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_{1},\\\\mathbf{r}_{2}) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sqrt{8\\\\pi^{5/2}+5\\\\pi^{3}}}\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\\\mathbf{r}_{2}\\\\right)\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\big(r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}\\\\big)\\\\right). The corresponding ground-state total energy is then E=E_R+E_u=\\\\frac{3}{4}+\\\\frac{5}{4} = 2 E_{\\\\mathrm{h}}. Remarks The exact ground state electronic density of the Hooke atom for the special case k=1/4 is :\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi^{3/2}(8+5\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi})}e^{-(1/2)r^{2}}\\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\right)^{1/2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{7}{4}+\\\\frac{1}{4}r^{2}+\\\\left(r+\\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\right)\\\\mathrm{erf}\\\\left(\\\\frac{r}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\right)\\\\right)+e^{-(1/2)r^{2}}\\\\right). From this we see that the radial derivative of the density vanishes at the nucleus. This is in stark contrast to the real (non-relativistic) helium atom where the density displays a cusp at the nucleus as a result of the unbounded Coulomb potential.

Balloon tanks are very light, and this permits a good propellant mass fraction. A disadvantage of balloon tanks is that if pressurization fails, the vessel collapses.  Design  Balloon tanks get their name from the cylindrical party balloons that inspired Karel Bossart, who designed both the Atlas and Centaur rockets for the U.S. Air Force and NASA. Constructed of very thin 301 extra-full-hard stainless steel 0.014-0.037 inch (0.3556-0.9398 mm) thick, prior to integration into the Atlas or Centaur rocket body the tanks are inflated with nitrogen to give them their shape and strength. As such, balloon tanks must always remain pressurized, as any appreciable drop in pressurization will result in failure. However, the airframes could be handled without tank pressurization through the use of a \\"stretch\\" mechanism (which basically helped support vehicle weight and prevented collapse). By contrast, non-balloon tanks in other liquid-propelled rockets remain rigid while empty due to an internal framework, although they do also depend on internal pressurization to support thrust and launch loads.  History  The use of balloon tanks in the Atlas ICBM was the brainchild of rocket designer Karel Bossart. Instead of the traditional internal framework used on the rockets available at that time, especially the Redstone short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), a direct descendant of the V-2 rocket, the Atlas ICBM designers used the balloon tank concept to lighten the rocket enough to hurl up to a 3.75 megaton thermonuclear warhead at a target in the Soviet Union from a launch pad in the contiguous United States. This tank technology made feasible a relatively simple stage-and-a-half design for Atlas instead of the more complicated staging used in later LGM-25 Titan ICBMs. After its initial development in the Atlas rocket, Bossart used the same technology with the high-energy Centaur upper stage. The Centaur rocket, fueled with liquid hydrogen and powered by an RL10 engine, was originally planned to be used with the Saturn V rocket for high-energy missions to the Solar System, but was later adapted for use as part of the Atlas and Titan rockets. In May 1963 at Vandenberg Air Force Base an Atlas‚ÄìAgena vehicle under static testing suffered a pressurization failure, leading to the total collapse of the vehicle that was scheduled to carry a KH-7 spy satellite. The Agena upper stage was repaired and used for later flight. A later review of hardware serial numbers lead to the conclusion that the satellite payload had not yet been mounted on the rocket during the failed test. With the introduction of the Atlas V Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), balloon tanks and half-staging are no longer used on the Atlas rocket. Centaur, however, retains this feature, yet it has not undergone a single catastrophic failure since the Atlas V's first flight.

Colors grown include red, green and several shades of brown.Dickerson et al., Naturally colored cotton CATI #990901 The cotton's natural color does not fade. Yields are typically lower and the fiber is shorter and weaker but has a softer feel than the more commonly available \\"white\\" cotton. This form of cotton also feels softer to the skin (this statement is subjective and needs verification) and has a pleasant smell. Naturally Colored Cotton is still relatively rare because it requires specialized harvest techniques and facilities, making it more expensive to harvest than white cotton. By the 1990s most indigenous colored cotton landraces or cultivars grown in Africa, Asia and Central and South America were replaced by all-white, commercial varieties. History Naturally colored cotton is believed to have originated in the Americas around 5000 years ago in the Andes.James M. Vreeland, Jr. The Revival of Colored Cotton, Scientific American. Apr 1999, Vol. 280 Issue 4, p 112 Naturally colored cotton today mostly comes from pre-Columbian stocks created by the indigenous peoples of South America (Vreeland, 1999). Mochica Indians could be attributed with growing naturally colored cotton of myriad hues, which they maintained for over the last two millenniums on the northern coast of Peru. Colors Natural color in cotton comes from pigments found in cotton; these pigments can produce shades ranging from tan to green and brown.Hustvedt, G., & Crews, P. C. (2005). The Ultraviolet Protection Factor of Naturally-pigmented Cotton, The Journal of Cotton Science, p. 47-56 Naturally pigmented green cotton derives its color from caffeic acid, a derivative of cinnamic acid, found in the suberin (wax) layer which is deposited in alternating layers with cellulose around the outside of the cotton fiber.Hustvedt, G., & Crews, P. C. (1999, October). Naturally Colored Cotton: Resistance to Changes, The Journal of Cotton Science , p. 1-49 While green colored cotton comes from wax layers, brown and tan cottons derive their color from tannin vacuoles in the lumen of the fiber cells. Limitations The naturally colored cotton has a small fiber and is not suitable for heavy machine spinning. During World War II an insufficient supply of dye led to the cultivation of green and brown cotton in the Soviet Union. The US government also showed interest in cultivation of naturally colored cotton but later aborted the project due to low yield and short staple length. ‚ÄúLater on US government instructed a famous agronomist, J.O.Ware, to study the Soviet cotton plants to determine whether they were commercially viable in the U.S. Ware and his colleagues concluded that the green and brown cotton plants yielded too little lint that was too short in staple length. Colored cotton was officially regulated to obscurity. Only in a few places were people still entranced by its possibilities.‚Äù Due to smaller fiber, it becomes unpractical to use naturally colored cotton for clothing manufacturers.Kimmel, L. B. (1996, April 23). A New Spin on Naturally Colored Cotton, United States Department of Agriculture. Retrieved November 10, 2010 But now, colored cotton is literally squeezed in with the conventional white cotton to make its fiber longer and stronger than other naturally colored cotton to be used in typical looms. Since this hybrid cotton fiber is stronger, it is being used by Levis, L.L. Bean, Eileen Fisher, and Fieldcrest for clothes like khakis. Commercial cultivation A new arrival on the Western fashion market, naturally pigmented cotton originally flourished some 5,000 years ago. Its revival today draws on stocks first developed and cultivated by Indians in South and Central America. Recent commercial cultivation currently uses pre-Columbian stocks created by the indigenous peoples of South America. Commercial cultivation still continues in South America as many big US companies such as Patagonia, Levi Strauss, and Esprit are buying naturally grown cotton along with white cotton which requires significant amount of insecticides and pesticides. Upgrade in technology Naturally colored cotton had a smaller fiber which was not suitable for mechanical looms used today, so this kept it from entering the commercial market. In 1982, Sally Fox a graduate in Integrated Pest Management from University of California with a master's degree started researching on colored cotton and integrated her knowledge and experience in technology and introduced first long fiber of naturally colored cotton.Sally Fox and Natural Cotton, About.com (2009). Retrieved November 9, 2010 Sally Fox later started her company, Natural Cotton Colors, Inc. and got patents in different shades including: green, Coyote brown, Buffalo brown, and Palo Verde green under FoxFiber. Later on the technology was further improved by a cotton breeder Raymond Bird in 1984. Bird began experimenting in Reedley, California, with red, green, and brown cotton to improve fiber quality. Later on Raymond Bird along with his brother and C. Harvey Campbell Jr., a California agronomist and cotton breeder, and formed BC Cotton Inc. to work with naturally colored cottons. Naturally colored cotton usually come in four standard colors - green, brown, red (a reddish brown) and mocha (similar to tan). Benefits There is experimental evidence to demonstrate that naturally pigmented cottons, especially green cotton, have excellent sun protection properties, when compared with unbleached white cotton that needs to be treated with dyes or finishes to obtain similar properties. It is hypothesized that the pigments in naturally pigmented cotton fibers are present to provide protection from ultraviolet radiation for the embryonic cotton seeds, however they can also provide protection from the sun‚Äôs harmful rays for consumers who wear garments manufactured from these naturally pigmented fibers. The UPF values of the naturally pigmented cottons examined in a university study remained high enough, even after 80 AFUs (AATCC Fading Units)of light exposure and repeated laundering, that the fabrics merited sun protection ratings of ‚Äúgood‚Äù to ‚Äúvery good‚Äù according to ASTM 6603 voluntary labeling guidelines for UV-protective textiles. Use of dyes Naturally colored cotton is unique and exceptionally different from white cotton as it does not need to be dyed.Dickerson, D. K., Lane, E. F., & Rodrigues, D. F. (1996, October). Evaluation of Selected Performance: Characteristics of Naturally Colored Cotton Knit Fabrics, California Agricultural Technology Institute. Retrieved November 10, 2010 According to agronomists, the cost of dyeing could be up to half of the value, and also environmentally friendly, as it eliminates disposal costs for toxic dye waste. According to Dr. Frank Werber, National Program Leader for Fabric and Materials, Agriculture Research Service, USDA, naturally colored cotton is ecologically valid as well as economical. Elimination of dyeing in production could save from $.60-1.50 per pound of fabric. Naturally colored cotton is also resistant to change as compared with the conventional dyed white cotton. After laundering, the color becomes stronger and more intense, a characteristic documented during research studies at Texas Tech University. The length of time required to \\"bring out\\" the color varies with color and variety. Eventually, the colors may start to return to their original color. Some naturally colored cotton darkens with exposure to the sun. However, green is less stable and fades to tan when exposed to sunlight. Cost Due to the non-industrialized product naturally colored cottons yield less per acre, but growers are paid higher prices for their harvest. In 1993, colored cotton prices ranged from $3.60 to $4.50 per pound compared to conventional white cotton at $0.60 to $0.90 per pound. References * J.M.

In 1983, the Conrail chose to abandon the mainline tracks in favor of the Graham Line, which is still used by Metro-North's Port Jervis line and freight operator Norfolk Southern Railway. This longer route was the preferred route when local opposition to Metro-North caused the historically important Erie Main Line to be abandoned from Harriman to Middletown. The former Erie Railroad mainline turns northwest at Newburgh Junction (Harriman) and tracks terminate at the site of the now-removed and demolished Nepera Chemical plant in the village of Harriman. The undeveloped roadbed continues approximately two miles through Harriman and Monroe. The paved trail begins in Harriman NY with an informal trailhead and parking lot located at the corner of River Rd. and North Main St. There is a Norfolk Southern siding off the NYS&W; mainline near Chester that runs along the rail trail for about 0.5 miles. This siding is all that remains of Greycourt, which was once the site of a sizeable railroad yard and an interchange point between the Erie Railroad and the L&HR.; Greycourt is also where the Erie Railroad's Newburgh Branch split from the mainline. The trail earned the designation of \\"National Recreation Trail\\" in June 2007. Trail death In 1999, Paul Harnisch, an assistant district attorney for Orange County, was charged with murder for striking two skaters, killing one of them, while driving illegally on the trail in the Chester area. Harnish drove for a half-mile with the dead skater on the hood of his vehicle. He was found not guilty for reason of insanity and remanded to the custody of a psychiatric hospital for a period of years.Harnisch sent off to psych hospitalHarnisch going to L.I.

Early life Betty Jumel was born Amy Ada Beatrice Grimshaw in Fairhaven, Lytham St Annes, Lancashire in 1901. She was only 10 years old when she made her first stage appearance, alongside her father Harold Jumel, who toured an act round the music halls entitled The Four Jumels. Her father taught her to sing and dance, as well as how to best throw her voice - almost from her infancy. When the family disbanded before the First World War, the young Betty Jumel joined her father's double act, in which her main role was to play the piano, dance and sing. Fairly pretty and very small for her age, Jumel made the most of her youthful look and often wore a lace dress and ringlets during performances - which completed her girlish features. When her father enlisted, Jumel became a soubrette working in end-of-pier variety shows in the North of England. On her own With already a wealth of experience behind her, Jumel created her own comedy material, notably three solo turns under the heading A Bundle of Fun. In one of these scenarios, she played a fairy in a take-off of the ballet Swan Lake. In others she used her singing talent to comedy effect as an opera singer, or a concert pianist whose only ability was to play only the wrong notes. Becoming successful in her own right, it was not long before other performers eventually persuaded her to let them join her - and consequently, she appeared on a number of occasions with the gangling and ungainly Nat Jackley in a much-loved turn called 'At the Ball'. Jackley's angular body contrasted marvellously with Jumel's small figure in an overtight ball gown, which was split up one side to reveal her funny, wafer-thin legs. In 1959 she appeared in an early broadcast on the very long running BBC TV programme, The Good Old Days, performing a chaotic routine as an Opera singer in a theatrical costume which fell apart while she fell about the stage in the time honoured tradition of music hall. Jumel spent her life on tour in variety halls. She was known for her unfailing instinct for the mildly grotesque, as she interrupted herself during a piano recital, or took a drink of water from a vase of wilting flowers. Over more than half a century of performing her craft resulted in her simple, but brilliantly timed acts making her renowned wherever she went. Such was her comic timing that she also appeared in pantomimes in the winter and concert parties in the summer. Success Her first West End appearance was a Lyceum review Good Company in 1933 by Albert Burdon and Dan Leno Jnr. and during the Second World War she entertained the forces with ENSA in Egypt. She appeared in a number of films in the 1940s, appearing alongside Will Hay, Sandy Powell and Norman Evans. She also appeared in pantomime with Evans in Humpty Dumpty which was so successful that it ran from Christmas Eve to Easter. She and Evans also paired up for a radio series Good Evans. Personal life Betty Jumel was married, first to Victor, one of the Arnley Brothers - who performed a variety act in the 1920s. Their daughter Georgina, broke with family tradition by becoming a legitimate actress. Some years after the death of her first husband, she married an Italian acrobat Bill Castagnoli, who predeceased her. The comedian who was billed as 'The Bundle of Fun' and one of the last survivors of the variety halls, died in 1990 at the age of 89.

Within the broader private equity industry, two distinct sub-industries, leveraged buyouts and venture capital, experienced growth along parallel although interrelated tracks. The development of the private equity and venture capital asset classes has occurred through a series of boom and bust cycles since the middle of the 20th century. Private equity emerged in the 1990s out of the ashes of the savings and loan crisis, the insider trading scandals, the real estate market collapse and the recession of the early 1990s which had culminated in the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert and had caused the shutdown of the high-yield debt market. This period saw the emergence of more institutionalized private equity firms, ultimately culminating in the massive Dot-com bubble in 1999 and 2000. LBO bust (1990 to 1992) By the end of the 1980s the excesses of the leveraged buyout (LBO) market were beginning to show, with the bankruptcy of several large buyouts, including Robert Campeau's 1988 buyout of Federated Department Stores; the 1986 buyout of the Revco drug stores; Walter Industries; FEB Trucking and Eaton Leonard. At the time, the RJR Nabisco deal was showing signs of strain, leading to a recapitalization, in 1990, that included the contribution of $1.7 billion of new equity from KKR.Wallace, Anise C. \\"Nabisco Refinance Plan Set.\\" The New York Times, July 16, 1990. In response to the threat of unwelcome LBOs, some companies adopted techniques such as the so-called poison pill to protect them against hostile takeovers by effectively self-destructing the company if it were to be taken over, a practices that is increasingly discredited. The collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Drexel Burnham Lambert was the investment bank most responsible for the boom in private equity during the 1980s, due to its leadership in the issuance of high-yield debt. On May 12, 1986, Dennis Levine, a Drexel managing director and investment banker, was charged with insider trading. Levine pleaded guilty to four felonies, and implicated one of his recent partners, arbitrageur Ivan Boesky. Largely based on information Boesky promised to provide about his dealings with Michael Milken, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated an investigation of Drexel on November 17. Two days later, Rudy Giuliani, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, launched his own investigation. For two years, Drexel consistently denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the criminal and SEC cases were based almost entirely on the statements of an admitted felon seeking to reduce his sentence. The SEC sued Drexel in September 1988 for insider trading, stock manipulation, defrauding its clients and stock parking (buying stocks for the benefit of another). All of the transactions involved Milken and his department. Giuliani considered indicting Drexel under the }RICO Act, under the doctrine that companies are responsible for its employee's crimes. A RICO indictment would have required the firm to put up a performance bond of as much as $1 billion, in lieu of having its assets frozen. Most of Drexel's capital was borrowed money, as is common with most investment banks, and it is difficult to receive credit for firms under a RICO indictment. Drexel CEO Fred Joseph said that he had been told that if Drexel were indicted under RICO, it would only survive a month at most.Den of Thieves. Stewart, J. B. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991. . Minutes prior to being indicted, Drexel reached an agreement with the government in which it pleaded nolo contendere (no contest) to six felonies ‚Äì three counts of stock parking and three counts of stock manipulation. It also agreed to pay a fine of $650 million ‚Äì at the time, the largest fine ever levied under securities laws. Milken had left the firm after his own indictment in March 1989.New Street Capital Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on New Street Capital Inc at ReferenceForBusiness.com Effectively, Drexel was now a convicted felon. In April 1989, Drexel settled with the SEC, agreeing to stricter safeguards on its oversight procedures. Later that month, the firm eliminated 5,000 jobs by shuttering three departments, including the retail brokerage operation. Meanwhile, the high-yield debt markets had begun to shut down in 1989, a slowdown that accelerated into 1990. On February 13, 1990 after being advised by United States Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Federal Reserve System, Drexel Burnham Lambert officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. S&L; and the shutdown of the Junk Bond Market In the 1980s, the boom in private equity transactions, specifically leveraged buyouts, was driven by the availability of financing, particularly high-yield debt, also known as \\"junk bonds\\". The collapse of the high yield market in 1989 and 1990 would signal the end of the LBO boom. At that time, many market observers were pronouncing the junk bond market ‚Äúfinished.‚Äù This collapse would be due largely to three factors: * The collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the foremost underwriter of junk bonds (discussed above). * The dramatic increase in default rates among junk bond issuing companies. The historical default rate for high yield bonds from 1978 to 1988 was approximately 2.2% of total issuance. In 1989, defaults increased dramatically to 4.3% of the then $190 billion market and an additional 2.6% of issuance defaulted in the first half of 1990. As a result of the higher perceived risk, the differential in yield of the junk bond market over U.S. treasuries (known as the \\"spread\\") had also increased by 700 basis points (7 percentage points). This made the cost of debt in the high yield market significantly more expensive than it had been previously.Altman, Edward I. \\"THE HIGH YIELD BOND MARKET: A DECADE OF ASSESSMENT, COMPARING 1990 WITH 2000.\\" NYU Stern School of Business, 2000HYLTON, RICHARD D. Corporate Bond Defaults Up Sharply in '89 New York Times, January 11, 1990. The market shut down altogether for lower rated issuers. * The mandated withdrawal of savings and loans from the high yield market. In August 1989, the U.S. Congress enacted the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 as a response to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. Under the law, savings and loans (S&Ls;) could no longer invest in bonds that were rated below investment grade. Additionally, S&Ls; were mandated to sell their holdings by the end of 1993 creating a huge supply of low priced assets that helped freeze the new issuance market. Despite the adverse market conditions, several of the largest private equity firms were founded in this period including: *Apollo Management founded in 1990 by Leon Black, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert banker and Michael Milken lieutenant; *Madison Dearborn founded in 1992, by a team of professionals who previously made investments for First Chicago Bank.; COMPANY NEWS; Fund Venture Begun in Chicago New York Times, January 7, 1992 and *TPG Capital (formerly Texas Pacific Group) in 1992 by David Bonderman and James Coulter, who had worked previously with Robert M. Bass. The second private equity boom and the origins of modern private equity Beginning roughly in 1992, three years after the RJR Nabisco buyout, and continuing through the end of the decade the private equity industry once again experienced a tremendous boom, both in venture capital (as will be discussed below) and leveraged buyouts with the emergence of brand name firms managing multibillion-dollar sized funds. After declining from 1990 through 1992, the private equity industry began to increase in size raising approximately $20.8 billion of investor commitments in 1992 and reaching a high-water mark in 2000 of $305.7 billion, outpacing the growth of almost every other asset class.Source: Thomson Financial's VentureXpert database for Commitments. Searching \\"All Private Equity Funds\\" (Venture Capital, Buyout and Mezzanine). Resurgence of leveraged buyouts Private equity in the 1980s was a controversial topic, commonly associated with corporate raids, hostile takeovers, asset stripping, layoffs, plant closings and outsized profits to investors. As private equity reemerged in the 1990s it began to earn a new degree of legitimacy and respectability. Although in the 1980s, many of the acquisitions made were unsolicited and unwelcome, private equity firms in the 1990s focused on making buyouts attractive propositions for management and shareholders. According to The Economist, ‚Äú[B]ig companies that would once have turned up their noses at an approach from a private-equity firm are now pleased to do business with them.‚ÄùThe New Kings of Capitalism, Survey on the Private Equity industry The Economist, November 25, 2004 Additionally, private equity investors became increasingly focused on the long term development of companies they acquired, using less leverage in the acquisition. This was in part due to the lack of leverage available for buyouts during this period. In the 1980s leverage would routinely represent 85% to 95% of the purchase price of a company as compared to average debt levels between 20% and 40% in leveraged buyouts in the 1990s and the 2000s (decade). KKR's 1986 acquisition of Safeway, for example, was completed with 97% leverage and 3% equity contributed by KKR, whereas KKR's acquisition of TXU in 2007 was completed with approximately 19% equity contributed ($8.5 billion of equity out of a total purchase price of $45 billion). Additionally, private equity firms are more likely to make investments in capital expenditures and provide incentives for management to build long-term value. The Thomas H. Lee Partners acquisition of Snapple Beverages, in 1992, is often described as the deal that marked the resurrection of the leveraged buyout after several dormant years.Thomas H. Lee In Snapple Deal (The New York Times, 1992) Only eight months after buying the company, Lee took Snapple Beverages public and in 1994, only two years after the original acquisition, Lee sold the company to Quaker Oats for $1.7 billion. Lee was estimated to have made $900 million for himself and his investors from the sale. Quaker Oats would subsequently sell the company, which performed poorly under new management, three years later for only $300 million to Nelson Peltz's Triarc. As a result of the Snapple deal, Thomas H. Lee, who had begun investing in private equity in 1974, would find new prominence in the private equity industry and catapult his Boston- based Thomas H. Lee Partners to the ranks of the largest private equity firms. It was also in this timeframe that the capital markets would start to open up again for private equity transactions. During the 1990-1993 period, Chemical Bank established its position as a key lender to private equity firms under the auspices of pioneering investment banker, James B. Lee, Jr. (known as Jimmy Lee, not related to Thomas H. Lee). By the mid-20th century, under Jimmy Lee, Chemical had established itself as the largest lender in the financing of leveraged buyouts. Lee built a syndicated leveraged finance business and related advisory businesses including the first dedicated financial sponsor coverage group, which covered private equity firms in much the same way that investment banks had traditionally covered various industry sectors.Jimmy Lee's Global Chase. New York Times, April 14, 1997Kingpin of the Big-Time Loan. New York Times, August 11, 1995 The following year, David Bonderman and James Coulter, who had worked for Robert M. Bass during the 1980s, together with William S. Price III, completed a buyout of Continental Airlines in 1993, through their nascent Texas Pacific Group, (today TPG Capital). TPG was virtually alone in its conviction that there was an investment opportunity with the airline. The plan included bringing in a new management team, improving aircraft utilization and focusing on lucrative routes. By 1998, TPG had generated an annual internal rate of return of 55% on its investment. Unlike Carl Icahn's hostile takeover of TWA in 1985.,10 Questions for Carl Icahn by Barbara Kiviat, Time Magazine, February 15, 2007 Bonderman and Texas Pacific Group were widely hailed as saviors of the airline, marking the change in tone from the 1980s. The buyout of Continental Airlines would be one of the few successes for the private equity industry which has suffered several major failures, including the 2008 bankruptcies of ATA Airlines, Aloha Airlines and Eos Airlines. Among the most notable buyouts of the mid-to-late 1990s included: *Duane Reade, 1990, 1997 :The company's founders sold Duane Reade to Bain Capital for approximately $300 million.

As the market for private equity matured, so too did its investor base. The Institutional Limited Partner Association was initially founded as an informal networking group for limited partner investors in private equity funds in the early 1990s. However the organization would evolve into an advocacy organization for private equity investors with more than 200 member organizations from 10 countries. As of the end of 2007, ILPA members had total assets under management in excess of $5 trillion with more than $850 billion of capital commitments to private equity investments. The venture capital boom and the Internet Bubble (1995 to 2000) In the 1980s, FedEx and Apple Inc. were able to grow because of private equity or venture funding, as were Cisco, Genentech, Microsoft and Avis.Private Equity: Past, Present, Future , by Sethi, Arjun May 2007, accessed October 20, 2007. However, by the end of the 1980s, venture capital returns were relatively low, particularly in comparison with their emerging leveraged buyout cousins, due in part to the competition for hot startups, excess supply of IPOs and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers. Unlike the leveraged buyout industry, after total capital raised increased to $3 billion in 1983, growth in the venture capital industry remained limited through the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s increasing to just over $4 billion more than a decade later in 1994. After a shakeout of venture capital managers, the more successful firms retrenched, focusing increasingly on improving operations at their portfolio companies rather than continuously making new investments. Results would begin to turn very attractive, successful and would ultimately generate the venture capital boom of the 1990s. Former Wharton Professor Andrew Metrick refers to these first 15 years of the modern venture capital industry beginning in 1980 as the \\"pre- boom period\\" in anticipation of the boom that would begin in 1995 and last through the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000.Metrick, Andrew. Venture Capital and the Finance of Innovation. John Wiley & Sons, 2007. p.12 The late 1990s were a boom time for the venture capital, as firms on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park and Silicon Valley benefited from a huge surge of interest in the nascent Internet and other computer technologies. Initial public offerings of stock for technology and other growth companies were in abundance and venture firms were reaping large windfalls. *Amazon.com *America Online *eBay *Intuit *Macromedia *Netscape *Sun Microsystems *Yahoo! - On April 5, 1995, Sequoia Capital provided Yahoo with two rounds of venture capital. On 12 April 1996, Yahoo had its initial public offering, raising $33.8 million, by selling 2.6 million shares at $13 each. The bursting of the Internet Bubble and the private equity crash (2000 to 2003) The technology-heavy NASDAQ Composite index peaked at 5,048 in March 2000, reflecting the high point of the dot-com bubble. The Nasdaq crash and technology slump that started in March 2000 shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed. Over the next two years, many venture firms had been forced to write-off their large proportions of their investments and many funds were significantly \\"under water\\" (the values of the fund's investments were below the amount of capital invested). Venture capital investors sought to reduce size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds and in numerous instances, investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the secondary market. By mid-2003, the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its 2001 capacity. Nevertheless, PricewaterhouseCoopers' MoneyTree Survey shows that total venture capital investments held steady at 2003 levels through the second quarter of 2005. Although the post-boom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in 2000, they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from 1980 through 1995. As a percentage of GDP, venture investment was 0.058% percent in 1994, peaked at 1.087% (nearly 19 times the 1994 level) in 2000 and ranged from 0.164% to 0.182% in 2003 and 2004. The revival of an Internet-driven environment (thanks to deals such as eBay's purchase of Skype, the News Corporation's purchase of MySpace.com, and the very successful Google.com and Salesforce.com IPOs) have helped to revive the venture capital environment. However, as a percentage of the overall private equity market, venture capital has still not reached its mid-1990s level, let alone its peak in 2000.

It was later reported that PennPraxis hired five experts to devise alternative plans for the casinos, accommodating for reduced on-site parking, a breakdown from a more singular building mass to allow more public access to the river, a 30-percent allotment of the area for open space, use of green roofs and accommodations for mass transit, to conform to PennPraxis' civic vision, parts of which the mayor has since promised to accept.

Within the broader private equity industry, two distinct sub-industries, leveraged buyouts and venture capital expanded along parallel and interrelated tracks. The development of the private equity and venture capital asset classes evolved, from the middle of the 20th century, through a series of boom-and-bust business cycles. As the century ended, so, too, did the dot-com bubble and the tremendous growth in venture capital that had marked the previous five years. Following the collapse of the dot-com bubble, a new \\"Golden Age\\" of private equity ensued, as leveraged buyouts reach unparalleled size and private equity firms achieved new growth levels of scale and institutionalization, an example of which is found in The Blackstone Group's 2007 IPO.

Stagnation in the LBO market Meanwhile, as the venture sector collapsed, the activity in the leveraged buyout market also declined significantly. Leveraged buyout firms had invested heavily in the telecommunications sector from 1996 to 2000 and profited from the boom which suddenly fizzled in 2001. In that year at least 27 major telecommunications companies, (i.e., with $100 million of liabilities or greater) filed for bankruptcy protection. Telecommunications, which made up a large portion of the overall high yield universe of issuers, dragged down the entire high yield market. Overall corporate default rates surged to levels unseen since the 1990 market collapse rising to 6.3 percent of high yield issuance in 2000 and 8.9 percent of issuance in 2001. Default rates on junk bonds peaked at 10.7 percent in January 2002 according to Moody's.BERENSON, ALEX. \\"Markets & Investing; Junk Bonds Still Have Fans Despite a Dismal Showing in 2001.\\" New York Times, January 2, 2002.SMITH, ELIZABETH REED. \\"Investing; Time to Jump Back Into Junk Bonds?.\\" New York Times, September 1, 2002.

The major collapses of former high-fliers including WorldCom, Adelphia Communications, Global Crossing and Winstar Communications were among the most notable defaults in the market. In addition to the high rate of default, many investors lamented the low recovery rates achieved through restructuring or bankruptcy. Among the most affected by the bursting of the internet and telecom bubbles were two of the largest and most active private equity firms of the 1990s: Tom Hicks' Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Ted Forstmann's Forstmann Little & Company. These firms were often cited as the highest profile private equity casualties, having invested heavily in technology and telecommunications companies.Atlas, Riva D. \\"Even the Smartest Money Can Slip Up.\\" New York Times, December 30, 2001 Hicks Muse's reputation and market position were both damaged by the loss of over $1 billion from minority investments in six telecommunications and 13 Internet companies at the peak of the 1990s stock market bubble.Will He Star Again In a Buyout Revival (New York Times, 2003)Forbes Faces: Thomas O.

The humbling of these private equity titans could hardly have been predicted by their investors in the 1990s and forced fund investors to conduct due diligence on fund managers more carefully and include greater controls on investments in partnership agreements. Deals completed during this period tended to be smaller and financed less with high yield debt than in other periods. Private equity firms had to cobble together financing made up of bank loans and mezzanine debt, often with higher equity contributions than had been seen. Private equity firms benefited from the lower valuation multiples. As a result, despite the relatively limited activity, those funds that invested during the adverse market conditions delivered attractive returns to investors. Meanwhile, in Europe LBO activity began to increase as the market continued to mature. In 2001, for the first time, European buyout activity exceeded US activity with $44 billion of deals completed in Europe as compared with just $10.7 billion of deals completed in the US. This was a function of the fact that just six LBOs in excess of $500 million were completed in 2001, against 27 in 2000.Almond, Siobhan. \\"European LBOs: Breakin' away.\\" TheDeal.com, January 24, 2002 As investors sought to reduce their exposure to the private equity asset class, an area of private equity that was increasingly active in these years was the nascent secondary market for private equity interests. Secondary transaction volume increased from historical levels of two or three percent of private equity commitments to five percent of the addressable market in the early years of the new decade.Vaughn, Hope and Barrett, Ross. \\"Secondary Private Equity Funds: The Perfect Storm: An Opportunity in Adversity\\". Columbia Strategy, 2003.Rossa, Jennifer and White, Chad. Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst Guide to the Secondary Market (2007 Edition). Many of the largest financial institutions (e.g., Deutsche Bank, Abbey National, UBS AG) sold portfolios of direct investments and ‚Äúpay-to-play‚Äù funds portfolios that were typically used as a means to gain entry to lucrative leveraged finance and mergers and acquisitions assignments but had created hundreds of millions of dollars of losses. Some of the most notable (publicly disclosed) secondary transactions, completed by financial institutions during this period, include: *Chase Capital Partners sold a $500 million portfolio of private equity funds interests in 2000. *National Westminster Bank completed the sale of over 250 direct equity investments valued at nearly $1 billion in 2000.Press Release: The Royal Bank of Scotland: asset sale *UBS AG sold a $1.3 billion portfolio of private equity fund interests in over 50 funds in 2003.HarbourVest transactions *Deutsche Bank sold a $2 billion investment portfolio as part of a spin-out of MidOcean Partners, funded by a consortium of secondary investors, in 2003. *Abbey National completed the sale of ¬£748 million ($1.33 billion) of LP interests in 41 private equity funds and 16 interests in private European companies in early 2004.Press Release: Abbey sells private equity portfolio to Coller Capital *Bank One sold a $1 billion portfolio of private equity fund interests in 2004. The third private equity boom and the \\"Golden Age\\" of private equity (2003‚Äì2007) As 2002 ended and 2003 began, the private equity sector, had spent the previous two and a half years reeling from major losses in telecommunications and technology companies and had been severely constrained by tight credit markets. As 2003 got underway, private equity began a five-year resurgence that would ultimately result in the completion of 13 of the 15 largest leveraged buyout transactions in history, unprecedented levels of investment activity and investor commitments and a major expansion and maturation of the leading private equity firms. The combination of decreasing interest rates, loosening lending standards and regulatory changes for publicly traded companies would set the stage for the largest boom private equity had seen. The Sarbanes Oxley legislation, officially the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act, passed in 2002, in the wake of corporate scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, Peregrine Systems and Global Crossing, Qwest Communications International, among others, would create a new regime of rules and regulations for publicly traded corporations. In addition to the existing focus on short term earnings rather than long term value creation, many public company executives lamented the extra cost and bureaucracy associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. For the first time, many large corporations saw private equity ownership as potentially more attractive than remaining public. Sarbanes-Oxley would have the opposite effect on the venture capital industry. The increased compliance costs would make it nearly impossible for venture capitalists to bring young companies to the public markets and dramatically reduced the opportunities for exits via IPO. Instead, venture capitalists have been forced increasingly to rely on sales to strategic buyers for an exit of their investment.Anderson, Jenny. \\"Sharply Divided Reactions to Report on U.S. Markets.\\" New York Times, December 1, 2006. Interest rates, which began a major series of decreases in 2002 would reduce the cost of borrowing and increase the ability of private equity firms to finance large acquisitions. Lower interest rates would encourage investors to return to relatively dormant high-yield debt and leveraged loan markets, making debt more readily available to finance buyouts. Additionally, alternative investments also became increasingly important as investors sought yield despite increases in risk. This search for higher yielding investments would fuel larger funds and in turn larger deals, never thought possible, became reality. Certain buyouts were completed in 2001 and early 2002, particularly in Europe where financing was more readily available. In 2001, for example, BT Group agreed to sell its international yellow pages directories business (Yell Group) to Apax Partners and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst for ¬£2.14 billion (approximately $3.5 billion at the time), making it then the largest non-corporate LBO in European history. Yell later bought US directories publisher McLeodUSA for about $600 million, and floated on London's FTSE in 2003. Resurgence of the large buyout Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003; large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high- yield debt financing, and larger transactions could be completed. The Carlyle Group, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, and other private investors, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex, marking the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East, in November 2002, and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West, in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Larger buyouts followed, signaling a resurgence in private equity, including Burger King by Bain Capital; Jefferson Smurfit by Madison Dearborn; Houghton MifflinSUZANNE KAPNER AND ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. \\"Market Place; Vivendi Is Said To Be Near Sale Of Houghton.\\" New York Times, October 31, 2002\\"COMPANY NEWS; VIVENDI FINISHES SALE OF HOUGHTON MIFFLIN TO INVESTORS.\\" New York Times, January 1, 2003. by Bain Capital, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H.

Private equity firms spin off cash USA Today, March 16, 2006. : LBOs are back, only they've rebranded themselves private equity and vow a happier ending. The firms say this time it's completely different. Instead of buying companies and dismantling them, as was their rap in the '80s, private equity firms‚Ä¶ squeeze more profit out of underperforming companies. :But whether today's private equity firms are simply a regurgitation of their counterparts in the 1980s‚Ä¶ or a kinder, gentler version, one thing remains clear: private equity is now enjoying a \\"Golden Age.\\" And with returns that triple the S&P; 500, it's no wonder they are challenging the public markets for supremacy. By 2004 and 2005, major buyouts were once again becoming common and market observers were stunned by the leverage levels and financing terms obtained by financial sponsors in their buyouts. Some of the notable buyouts of this period include: *Dollarama, 2004 :The U.S. chain of \\"dollar stores\\" was sold for $850 million to Bain Capital. *Toys \\"R\\" Us, 2004 :A consortium of Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and real estate development company Vornado Realty Trust announced the $6.6 billion acquisition of the toy retailer.

This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco at the end of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom. Also, at the time of its announcement, SunGard would be the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction it would cede to the buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction is also notable in the number of firms involved in the transaction.

Publicly traded private equity Although there had previously been certain instances of publicly traded private equity vehicles, the convergence of private equity and the public equity markets attracted significantly greater attention when several of the largest private equity firms pursued various options through the public markets. Taking private equity firms and private equity funds public appeared an unusual move since private equity funds often buy public companies listed on exchange and then take them private. Private equity firms are rarely subject to the quarterly reporting requirements of the public markets and tout this independence to prospective sellers as a key advantage of going private. Nevertheless, there are fundamentally two separate opportunities that private equity firms pursued in the public markets. These options involved a public listing of either: *A private equity firm (the management company), which provides shareholders an opportunity to gain exposure to the management fees and carried interest earned by the investment professionals and managers of the private equity firm. The most notable example of this public listing was completed by The Blackstone Group in 2007 *A private equity fund or similar investment vehicle, which allows investors that would otherwise be unable to invest in a traditional private equity limited partnership to gain exposure to a portfolio of private equity investments. In May 2006, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts raised $5 billion in an initial public offering for a new permanent investment vehicle (KKR Private Equity Investors or KPE) listing it on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam (ENXTAM: KPE). KKR raised more than three times what it had expected at the outset as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds seeking exposure to private equity but could not make long term commitments to private equity funds. Because private equity had been booming in the preceding years, the proposition of investing in a KKR fund appeared attractive to certain investors.Timmons, Heather. \\"Opening Private Equity's Door, at Least a Crack, to Public Investors.\\" New York Times, May 4, 2006. However, KPE's first-day performance was lackluster, trading down 1.7 percent and trading volume was limited.Timmons, Heather. \\"Private Equity Goes Public for $5 Billion. Its Investors Ask, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs Next?‚Äô.\\" New York Times, November 10, 2006.

KKR had previously listed its KKR Private Equity Investors (KPE) private equity fund vehicle in 2006. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market would dampen the prospects of obtaining a valuation that would be attractive to KKR and the flotation was repeatedly postponed. Meanwhile, other private equity investors were seeking to realize a portion of the value locked into their firms. In September 2007, the Carlyle Group sold a 7.5 percent interest in its management company to Mubadala Development Company, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) for $1.35 billion, which valued Carlyle at approximately $20 billion.Sorkin, Andrew Ross. \\"Carlyle to Sell Stake to a Mideast Government.\\" New York Times, September 21, 2007.

Historically, in the United States, there had been a group of publicly traded private equity firms that were registered as business development companies (BDCs) under the Investment Company Act of 1940.Companies must elect to be treated as a \\"business development company\\" under the terms of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act of 1940: Section 54 -- Election to Be Regulated as Business Development Company ) Typically, BDCs are structured similar to real estate investment trusts (REITs) in that the BDC structure reduces or eliminates corporate income tax. In return, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their income, which may be taxable to its investors. As of the end of 2007, among the largest BDCs (by market value, excluding Apollo Investment Corp, discussed earlier) are: American Capital Strategies (NASDAQ:ACAS), Allied Capital Corp (NASDAQ:ALD), Ares Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:ARCC), Gladstone Investment Corp (NASDAQ:GAIN) and Kohlberg Capital Corp (NASDAQ:KCAP). Secondary market and the evolution of the private equity asset class In the wake of the collapse of the equity markets in 2000, many investors in private equity sought an early exit from their outstanding commitments.Cortese, Amy. \\"Business; Private Traders See Gold in Venture Capital Ruins.\\" New York Times, April 15, 2001. The surge in activity in the secondary market, which had previously been a relatively small niche of the private equity industry, prompted new entrants to the market, however the market was still characterized by limited liquidity and distressed prices with private equity funds trading at significant discounts to fair value. Beginning in 2004 and extending through 2007, the secondary market transformed into a more efficient market in which assets for the first time traded at or above their estimated fair values and liquidity increased dramatically. During these years, the secondary market transitioned from a niche sub-category in which the majority of sellers were distressed to an active market with ample supply of assets and numerous market participants.Private Equity Market Environment: Spring 2004 , Probitas Partners By 2006 active portfolio management had become far more common in the increasingly developed secondary market and an increasing number of investors had begun to pursue secondary sales to rebalance their private equity portfolios. The continued evolution of the private equity secondary market reflected the maturation and evolution of the larger private equity industry. Among the most notable publicly disclosed secondary transactions (it is estimated that over two-thirds of secondary market activity is never disclosed publicly): *CalPERS, in 2008, agrees to the sale of a portfolio of a $2 billion portfolio of legacy private equity funds to a consortium of secondary market investors.CalPERS and where private equity funds go to die (WSJ.com, 2007) *Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, in 2007, reportedly agreed to sell a $400 million portfolio of private equity fund interestsOBWC Portfolio Sale Nears End *MetLife, in 2007, agreed to sell a $400 million portfolio of over 100 private equity fund interests. *Bank of America, in 2007, completed the spin-out of BA Venture Partners to form Scale Venture Partners, which was funded by an undisclosed consortium of secondary investors. *Mellon Financial Corporation, following the announcement of its merger with Bank of New York in 2006, sold a $1.4 billion portfolio of private equity fund and direct interests.Dow Jones Financial News: Goldman picks up Mellon portfolio *American Capital Strategies, in 2006, sold a $1 billion portfolio of investments to a consortium of secondary buyers.American Capital raises $1bn fund \\"ACS spins off stakes into $1B fund.\\" TheDeal.com *Bank of America, in 2006, completes the spin-out of BA Capital Europe to form Argan Capital, which was funded by an undisclosed consortium of secondary investors. *JPMorgan Chase, in 2006, completed the sale of a $925 million interest in JPMP Global Fund to a consortium of secondary investors. *Temasek Holdings, in 2006, completes $810 million securitization of a portfolio of 46 private equity funds.Singapore‚Äôs Temasek Hits Hard Going (Asia Sentinel, 2007) *Dresdner Bank, in 2005, sells a $1.4 billion private equity funds portfolio. *Dayton Power & Light, an Ohio-based electric utility, in 2005, sold a $1.2 billion portfolio of private equity fund interestsAlpInvest and Lexington Partners buy $1.2bn secondary portfolio from DPL M&A; legal guru urges more diligence\\"DPL to sell PE stakes for $850M.\\" TheDeal.com The credit crunch and post-modern private equity (2007‚Äì2008) In July 2007, turmoil that had been affecting the mortgage markets, spilled over into the leveraged finance and high-yield debt markets.SORKIN, ANDREW ROSS and de la MERCED, MICHAEL J. \\"Private Equity Investors Hint at Cool Down.\\" New York Times, June 26, 2007SORKIN, ANDREW ROSS. \\"Sorting Through the Buyout Freezeout.\\" New York Times, August 12, 2007. The markets had been highly robust during the first six months of 2007, with highly issuer friendly developments including PIK and PIK Toggle (interest is \\"Payable In Kind\\") and covenant light debt widely available to finance large leveraged buyouts. July and August saw a notable slowdown in issuance levels in the high yield and leveraged loan markets with only few issuers accessing the market. Uncertain market conditions led to a significant widening of yield spreads, which coupled with the typical summer slowdown led to many companies and investment banks to put their plans to issue debt on hold until the autumn. However, the expected rebound in the market after Labor Day 2007 did not materialize and the lack of market confidence prevented deals from pricing. By the end of September, the full extent of the credit situation became obvious as major lenders including Citigroup and UBS AG announced major writedowns due to credit losses. The leveraged finance markets came to a near standstill.Turmoil in the marketsThe Economist July 27, 2007 As a result of the sudden change in the market, buyers would begin to withdraw from or renegotiate the deals completed at the top of the market: *Harman International (announced and withdrawn, 2007) :Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners announced the $8 billion takeover of Harman, the maker of JBL speakers and Harman Kardon, in April 2008.

The film suggested that The Carlyle Group exerted tremendous influence on U.S. government policy and contracts through their relationship with the president‚Äôs father, George H. W. Bush, a former senior adviser to the Carlyle Group. Additionally, Moore cited relationships with the Bin Laden family. The movie quotes author Dan Briody claiming that the Carlyle Group \\"gained\\" from September 11 because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm‚Äôs $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the U.S. Army is one of the few weapons systems canceled by the Bush administration.Pratley, Nils. Fahrenheit 9/11 had no effect, says Carlyle chief, The Guardian, February 15, 2005. Over the next few years, attention intensified on private equity as the size of transactions and profile of the companies increased. The attention would increase significantly following a series of events involving The Blackstone Group: the firm's initial public offering and the birthday celebration of its CEO. The Wall Street Journal observing Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman's 60th birthday celebration in February 2007 described the event as follows:Sender, Henny and Langley, Monica. \\"Buyout Mogul: How Blackstone's Chief Became $7 Billion Man ‚Äì Schwarzman Says He's Worth Every Penny; $400 for Stone Crabs.\\" The Wall Street Journal, June 13, 2007. > The Armory's entrance hung with banners painted to replicate Mr. > Schwarzman's sprawling Park Avenue apartment. A brass band and children clad > in military uniforms ushered in guests. A huge portrait of Mr. Schwarzman, > which usually hangs in his living room, was shipped in for the occasion. The > affair was emceed by comedian Martin Short. Rod Stewart performed.

The > menu included lobster, baked Alaska and a 2004 Louis Jadot Chassagne > Montrachet, among other fine wines. Schwarzman received a severe backlash from both critics of the private equity industry and fellow investors in private equity. The lavish event which reminded many of the excesses of notorious executives including Bernie Ebbers (WorldCom) and Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco International). David Rubenstein, the founder of The Carlyle Group remarked, \\"We have all wanted to be private ‚Äì at least until now. When Steve Schwarzman's biography with all the dollar signs is posted on the web site none of us will like the furor that results ‚Äì and that's even if you like Rod Stewart.\\" Rubenstein's fears would be confirmed when in 2007, the Service Employees International Union launched a campaign against private equity firms, specifically the largest buyout firms through public events, protests as well as leafleting and web campaigns.Sorkin, Andrew Ross. \\"Sound and Fury Over Private Equity.\\" The New York Times, May 20, 2007.Heath, Thomas. \\"Ambushing Private Equity: As SEIU Harries New Absentee Owners, Buyout Firms Dispute the Union's Agenda\\" The Washington Post, April 18, 2008Service Employees International Union's \\"Behind the Buyouts \\" website A number of leading private equity executives were targeted by the union membersDiStefano, Joseph N. Hecklers delay speech; Carlyle CEO notes private- equity ‚Äòpurgatory‚Äô The Philadelphia Inquirer, Jan. 18, 2008. however the SEIU's campaign was not nearly as effective at slowing the buyout boom as the credit crunch of 2007 and 2008 would ultimately prove to be. In 2008, the SEIU would shift part of its focus from attacking private equity firms directly toward the highlighting the role of sovereign wealth funds in private equity. The SEIU pushed legislation in California that would disallow investments by state agencies (particularly CalPERS and CalSTRS) in firms with ties to certain sovereign wealth funds.California's Stern Rebuke. The Wall Street Journal, April 21, 2008; Page A16. Additionally, the SEIU has attempted to criticize the treatment of taxation of carried interest. The SEIU, and other critics, point out that many wealthy private equity investors pay taxes at lower rates (because the majority of their income is derived from carried interest, payments received from the profits on a private equity fund's investments) than many of the rank and file employees of a private equity firm's portfolio companies.Protesting a Private Equity Firm (With Piles of Money) The New York Times, October 10, 2007.

Biography Born at Saint-√âtienne, Loire, Boudarel studied at a Marist seminary before becoming a history professor at the Saigon Lyc√©e Marie-Curie in the late 1940s and during the First Indochina War. He led the Indochinese branch of the French Communist Party, called Groupe culturel marxiste. In 1949, Boudarel, now a teacher of philosophy at the Lyc√©e Yersin in Da Lat, left his job and joined with the Viet Minh in the North of Tonkin, where he was made a Political commissar in the prisoner camp \\"Camp 113\\" at Lang-Kieu, near the Chinese border, South of Ha-Giang. He went by the nom de guerre of Dai Dong.¬´ Paris Journal; Vietnam Echo Stuns France: Case of Treachery? ¬ª, New York Times, 20 March 1991. Numerous testimonies of survivors of the camp later accused Boudarel of torturing French Army prisoners \\"with perverse cruelty, he applied to his countrymen the method of degradation by hunger, physical decline, political indoctrination and denunciation among inmates\\".Prisonnier au camp 113 During the year where he was on duty at the camp, 278 prisoners out of 320 perished. Boudarel left Vietnam in 1964 for the Soviet Union. He later worked in Czechoslovakia for the World Federation of Trade Unions. After an amnesty law was voted by the Parliament of France in June 1966, notably granting amnesty for crimes committed during the Indochina War,Law 66-409 of June 18, 1966, article 30: \\"All felonies and misdemeanors committed in relation to the events following the Vietnamese insurrection prior October 1, 1957, are amnestied.\\" he returned to France where he obtained a position as a ma√Ætre de conf√©rence at Paris Diderot University, and researcher at CNRS. He took part in the Mai 68 movement. On 13 February 1991, during a conference organised at the French Senate by the Centre des hautes √©tudes sur l‚ÄôAfrique et l‚ÄôAsie modernes, he was recognised by Jean-Jacques Beucler, a former secretary of State for veterans, who had been a prisoner at Camp 113. Further testimonies emerged, and within a year, charges of Crime against humanity were raised by survivors of Camp 113. The charges were turned down by the Cour de Cassation because of the 1966 amnesty law. A recourse made on 25 February 2000 at the European Court of Human Rights against France, complaining about the decision by the French Cour de Cassation and alleged violations of freedom of speech, was similarly turned down in March 2003. The ensuing controversy led to a proposal to amend article 213-5 of the French penal code so as to make crimes against humanity ineligible for amnesty.Proposition de loi visant √† rendre inamnistiables les crimes contre l'humanit√©  Works  * Georges Boudarel, La Bureaucratie au Vi√™t Nam, L'Harmattan, 1983. * Georges Boudarel, Cent fleurs √©closent dans la nuit du Vi√™t Nam, Jacques Bertoin, 1991  Bibliography  * Yves Daoudal, pr√©face de Jean-Baptiste Biaggi, Le dossier Boudarel, Editions Remi Perrin, 2001 * Jean-Jacques Beucler, M√©moires, France- Empire, 1991 * Thomas Capitaine, Captifs du Viet-Minh.

The history of aviation at Eastchurch stretches back to the first decade of the 20th century when it was used as an airfield by members of the Royal Aero Club. The area saw the first flight by a British pilot in Britain. In 1910 it was operated by the Royal Navy as a training aerodrome and it was known as the Naval Flying School, Eastchurch. In the 1910s the airfield was designated Royal Naval Air Station Eastchurch. With the amalgamation of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps on 1 April 1918, the station was transferred to the newly formed Royal Air Force and was re-designated Royal Air Force Eastchurch, or RAF Eastchurch for short. Early civilian aviation The members of the Aero Club of Great Britain established their first flying ground near Leysdown on the Isle of Sheppey in 1909. One of the Club's members, Francis McClean, acquired Stonepits Farm, on the marshes across from Leysdown, converting the land into an airfield for members of the Aero Club. A club house was established nearby at the Mussell Manor (now known as Muswell Manor). Left-to-right: Oswald (1883‚Äì1969), Horace (1872‚Äì1917) and Eustace Short (1875‚Äì1932) at Muswell Manor 1909 At the same time the Short Brothers established an aircraft factory at Shellbeach on Isle of Sheppey. This was the first aircraft factory in the British Isles and the first factory in the world for the series production of aircraft, these being license-built copies of the Wright A biplane. It was here that John Moore- Brabazon (later Lord Brabazon of Tara) made a flight of 500 yards in his Voisin biplane The Bird of Passage, officially recognised as the first flight by a British pilot in Britain. Later in 1909, Moore-Brabazon piloted the first live cargo flight by fixed-wing aircraft. In order to disprove the adage that pigs can't fly he attached a waste-paper basket to a wing strut of his aircraft and airlifted one small pig inside the basket. Later Moore-Brabazon, Professor Huntington, Charles Rolls and Cecil Grace all used the flying club's services. In May 1909 the Wright Brothers visited Sheppey and inspected the airfield before moving on to visit the Short Brothers' factory. They then took lunch at Mussell Manor with members of the Aero Club and there was considerable discussion regarding the possibility of establishing a flying school in Sheppey. Mussell Manor ‚Äì the birthplace and cradle of British aviation In 1910 both the airfield and the aircraft factory were relocated to larger quarters at Eastchurch, about 2.5 miles (4 km) away, where the Short- Dunne 5, designed by John W. Dunne, was built and became the first tailless aircraft to fly. In 1911 Shorts built one of the first successful twin-engine aircraft, the S.39 or Triple Twin. At this time seaplanes had to be taken by barge to Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey to be launched and tested.Hanson, Richard. Borstal: Short Brothers . Access date: 15 January 2007. Royal Navy use In November 1910 the Royal Aero Club, at the instigation of Francis McClean, offered the Royal Navy the use of its airfield at Eastchurch along with two aircraft and the services of its members as instructors in order that Naval officers might be trained as pilots. The Admiralty accepted and on 6 December the Commander-in-Chief at the Nore promulgated the scheme to the officers under his jurisdiction, stipulating that applicants be unmarried and able to pay the membership fees of the Royal Aero Club. Two hundred applications were received, and four were accepted: Lieutenants C.R. Samson, A.M. Longmore and A. Gregory, and Captain E L Gerrard, RMLI. It was originally planned that Cecil Grace would be their instructor but, following his untimely death, George Cockburn took his place, giving his services free of charge. Technical instruction was provided by Horace Short. The airfield later became the Naval Flying School, Eastchurch. Royal Air Force use Towards the end of the First World War, on 1 April 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps amalgamated. The station at Eastchurch was transferred to the newly formed Royal Air Force and was re-designated Royal Air Force Station Eastchurch, or RAF Eastchurch for short. During the last few months of the War, No. 204 Training Depot Station, the 64th (Naval) Wing and the 58th (Training) Wing were based at Eastchurch. RAF Eastchurch remained active during the inter-war years and it was home to No. 266 Squadron during the Battle of Britain.http://www.raf.mod.uk/bob1940/11group.html During the Second World War, Eastchurch was part of Coastal Command. A siding was laid to connect RAF Eastchurch with Eastchurch railway station on the Sheppey Light Railway. RAF Eastchurch closed in 1946. The Memorial to the Home of Aviation was unveiled in near All Saints' Church in Eastchurch in 1955. The following units were here at some point: Current use The site is currently used as HM Prison Standford Hill. While there are a number of new buildings some of the original buildings survive including a number of pillboxes. The main roads in the prison reflect the aviation links; Rolls Avenue and Airfield View, Short's Prospect and Wright's Way. In the entrance to HMP Swaleside are two brass plaques; one records that the prison is built on what was the airstrip of RAF Eastchurch and the other lists the owners of the airstrip from 1909 to the end of the RAF use.

He was a popular musical attraction throughout Alabama and recorded several sides in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Biography Coleman was born to a family of sharecroppers in Gainesville, Alabama, United States. While he and his three brothers endured hard physical labor, he was exposed to musical influences from his fellow sharecroppers in singing and discovering traditional folk songs. At age 12, he was introduced to the harmonica, in large part teaching himself, and was encouraged by his parents to hone his skills as an alternative to their wearying occupation. He performed locally for small wages at dance halls and parties. In 1914, upon the outbreak of the First World War, Coleman joined the United States Army and was stationed at Fort McClellan for the entirety of the conflict. At the fort, he developed a reputation for being stubbornly independent, often disobeying the Army's strict code of conduct. As a result, his superior officers would call him Jaybird, a nickname associated with him for the rest of his life. During this time Coleman first performed for large crowds as he entertained his fellow soldiers. After his military discharge, he briefly returned to Gainesville, working for a few months as a farm labourer, before relocating with his younger brother, Joe, to Bessemer, Alabama, and becoming a full-time musician. In 1922, Coleman teamed up with the singer and guitarist Big Joe Williams in tours across Alabama. He then traveled for two years with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels, a popular tent show, making appearances throughout the South. Returning to Bessemer, Coleman married a popular local singer, and the couple supported themselves by performing as a duo. The Colemans were regular churchgoers and were renowned in the black community for their renditions of gospel songs. As a blues musician, Coleman was popular with black and white audiences alike. Occasionally he would play a harmonica as he strolled through the streets, drawing a crowd that followed him. In 1926, Coleman began recording for Gennett Records, Silvertone Records, and Black Patti Records as a solo performer and as a member of the Bessemer Blues Pickers. His records were met with commercial success, but he asserted he was never compensated for his work. Despite his treatment by white-owned record companies, he allowed a charter of the Ku Klux Klan to manage his touring schedule and expand his audience to major southern cities. Typically, Coleman's performances featured little or no accompaniment in a style rooted in the work songs of his childhood. He particularly favored the high-pitched E and D harps and played them with a heavily choked cross-harp technique, marked by a rapid hand vibrato. In the 1930s, Coleman was loosely associated with the Birmingham Jug Band, a group he helped form, and recorded with them in sessions for OKeh Records and Columbia Records. In 1930, he recorded \\"Coffee Grinder Blues\\" for Columbia, which, in a dispute with the label over payment, he blocked from wider release. It is his rarest record. Coleman continued to perform on street corners in Alabama throughout the 1930s and 1940s. By the end of the 1940s, he disappeared from the music scene. He died of cancer on January 28, 1950, in Tuskegee, Alabama.

Club career Millar was one of several skilled Scottish players brought to Sunderland by manager Tom Watson, which collectively became known as the 'team of all talents'. A player noted for his skill on the ball rather than physical power, he made his debut for the Black Cats on 13 September 1890 against Burnley, a match Sunderland lost 3‚Äì2. He played for Sunderland over two different spells: 1890‚Äì96 (winning three Football League championships in four seasons) and 1900‚Äì04 (claiming a fourth title), separated by a stint in his homeland at Rangers where he won two Scottish Football League titles and two Scottish Cups. Overall he made 260 appearances for Sunderland, scoring 123 goals. At the time of his death he was the trainer for Chelsea. International career Millar was capped for Scotland three times between 1897 and 1898 during his time with Rangers, scoring twice, both in matches against England; his first was the winning goal to secure the 1896‚Äì97 British Home Championship at Crystal Palace, while his second at Celtic Park almost exactly a year later proved to be merely a consolation for the hosts as England won both the match and the tournament.

It was the vehicle for a group of abstract artists who wished to differentiate themselves from others gathered around the magazine Cercle et Carr√©. Eventually most in both groups fused in the wider association of non-figurative artists, Abstraction-Cr√©ation. Articles in Art Concret championed strictly geometrical art, free of personal interpretation and based on mathematics. It also ridiculed the sloppy and imprecise vocabulary of contemporary art criticism. The concept of Concrete Art championed by the magazine was thereafter taken up by other artists and became influential internationally. Background With the growing power of Surrealism, abstract artists living in Paris felt the need to assert their preferred style and began to discuss creating a united front. Theo van Doesburg had taken part in such conversations, initially with Joaqu√≠n Torres-Garc√≠a, but complained of insufficiently rigorous criteria for the type of work that should be included. Eventually he lost the argument and Torres-Garc√≠a joined with Michel Seuphor in creating the more inclusive Cercle et Carr√© group in 1929.Wintgens H√∂tte, Doris (2009) \\"Van Doesburg tackles the continent: passion, drive & calculation\\", in Van Doesburg & the International Avant-Garde: Constructing a New World, London, Tate Publishing, 2010, pp. 10-19. During the war of words that followed, Van Doesburg accused Seuphor of \\"intellectual sloppiness worthy of venal art dealers and critics\\"Seuphor's editorial in Cercle et Carr√© 2, 15 April 1930 and tried to recruit a rival group more in accord with his view of what abstract art should be. He was joined by the Armenian L√©on Arthur Tutundjian, the Swede Otto Gustaf Carlsund, and the Frenchman Jean H√©lion. In their names Van Doesburg sent a copy of a manifesto stating their position on abstract art (eventually to appear under the title Base de la peinture concrete) to Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart, who declined to sign it. Until then, the new group was to be called Groupement 6,6Theo van Doesburg: oeuvre catalogus, Centraal Museum, Utrecht 2000, p.531 but never did reach that number. When the manifesto was published under its new title, it was signed only by Tutundjian, Carlsund, Van Doesburg and H√©lion, with the addition of H√©lion's fellow lodger, the teenaged typographer Marcel Wantz (1911‚Äì79). An unsuccessful approach had meanwhile been made to Walmar Schwab who, while he was willing for his work to appear in the magazine, was temperamentally indisposed to put his name to anything so formal.Belfagor 4-6, 2007, p.651 The retitled manifesto appeared in the group's magazine, by now called Art Concret, in April 1930, a month after the first issue of the rival Cercle et Carr√©. But the group only exhibited together on three occasions, and even then as part of larger group exhibitions which also included Cercle et Carr√© members. The first was at the Salon des Surind√©pendents in June, followed in August by the exhibition AC: Internationell utst√§llning av postkubistisk konst (International exhibition of post-cubist art) in Stockholm and in October by Production Paris 1930 in Z√ºrich.Marie-Aline Prat 1984, p.40 At the same time Van Doesburg hosted further discussions at his home with the artists of both groups and early in 1931 launched the new movement, Abstraction-Cr√©ation, with himself briefly as vice-president.Ed Rasula, \\"Dangerous Games and New Mythologies\\", The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines: Europe 1880 ‚Äì 1940, OUP 2013, pp.265-273 The magazine On the cream-coloured front cover of the magazine, which measured 18.5 x 14 cm, appeared the large initials AC in a narrow sans-serif font, overprinted at the centre with the information \\"Introduction of the group and of the magazine Art Concret\\" in bold capital letters. Across the back cover this was supplemented with the information \\"Introductory number issued in April nineteen thirty\\". The group manifesto, followed by the surnames only of the five involved, appeared on page 1. The key points made there were that \\"A work of art must be entirely conceived and shaped by the mind before its execution. It should receive nothing from nature's formal properties nor from sensuality nor sentimentality. We want to exclude lyricism, dramaticism, symbolism, etc‚Ä¶The painting should be constructed entirely from purely plastic elements, that is to say planes and colours.\\" Van Doesburg's (unsigned) \\"commentaries\\" followed on pages 2‚Äì4 and were dated Paris, January 1930. In them he argued that, after the eras of natural and artistic form, comes the new era of mental form (forme esprit), \\"the concretisation of the creative mind. Concrete, not abstract painting, because nothing is more concrete than a line, a colour, a surface. As painters, we think and measure,\\" avoiding interpretation and subjectivity. Jean H√©lion's \\"The Problems of Concrete Art: Art and Mathematics\\", dated simply 1930, followed on pages 5‚Äì10. The article was punctuated by a reproduction of a Tutundjian relief (dated 1929) between pages 6‚Äì7 and a fold- out smaller sheet with designs by Carlsund, \\"Doesbourg\\", H√©lion and Tutundjian (all dated 1930), between pages 8‚Äì9. H√©lion opened with the proposition: \\"If art is universal, it escapes both personality and era. It belongs to the domain of constant certainties and is under the control of logic. The search for constants through logic is the shared aim of mathematics. Mathematics concretise constant certainties via formulae; painting does it via colours. So mathematics and painting are in essential relationship.\\" He later elaborates that the geometrical elements of a painting appear in numerical relationship but are modified by colour; works of art always differ from one another because of the laws of relativity. The Art Concret centrefold, April 1930 Van Doesburg's \\"Towards White Painting\\" followed on pages 11‚Äì12, dated December 1929. \\"Left behind us is the brown of rottenness and classicism,\\" he proclaims. \\"THERE'S NOTHING TO READ IN PAINT, ONLY SEEING\\", for art has grown up and \\"in place of dream the future will substitute art based on science and the technical\\". A statement in French, English and German appeared separately at the foot of the page: \\"Art is the spiritual transformation of (the) material\\". Page 13 had a sideways print by Schwab, titled \\"Composition\\" and dated 1929. The following page was taken up with a satirical attack on art journalism: first \\"A few words that have nothing to do with art\\": \\"sensibility, sensuality, emotion,\\" but also including watchwords of the Cercle et Carr√© group (\\"abstraction\\") and of the Cubists (\\"instantaneity\\"); then on the second half of the page a section titled \\"Critical standards for hire\\", a verbal collage created from a vacuous \\"selection of recent items in the press\\". \\"We are not alone\\", the Art Concret signatories assured readers on page 15, quoting from various public figures and artists, among whom appear the English dandies, Beau Brummel and Oscar Wilde. The board appealed on the final page for other painters to join them (so long as they approve the editorial stance and apply it), giving 50, rue Pierre Larousse as the editorial address and crediting H√©lion as the director. H√©lion later dismissed the magazine as \\"a flash in the pan\\"H√©lion \\"Art Concret 1930 and \\"a harangue in a public garden, a vast and almost empty one\\".Marie-Aline Prat 1984, p.39 Nevertheless, the group's manifesto had helped popularise the term Concrete Art and, through the championship of others (Torres-Garc√≠a among them), resulted eventually in the establishment of geometric abstraction under this name as an international phenomenon. By then the magazine had become a historical document and a reprint was issued in 1976.Information and PDF at the Bibliotheque Kandinsky Bibliography *Art Concret, a facsimile of the magazine *Jean H√©lion, ‚ÄúArt Concret 1930: Four Painters and a Magazine‚Äù *Marie-Aline Prat, Peinture Et Avant-garde Au Seuil Des Annees 30, , L'Age d'Homme, Lausanne 1984 References French art publications French artist groups and collectives Modernism ","title":"Art Concret"},{"id":"18649726","text":"Scarab Productions, Inc. is a film, television and new media production company that specializes in family entertainment.

Description Yafteh has yielded the largest number of C14 dates from a single Paleolithic site in Iran that are clustered around 28‚Äì35 thousand years ago. A rich collection of ornaments made of marine shells, tooth and hematite has been discovered in the early Upper Paleolithic deposits in both early and recent excavations in the Yafteh cave. This collection was analyzed and published by Sonia Shidrang in the Iranian Journal of Archaeology and History. Archaeological history The site was found and later excavated by two American archaeologists, Frank Hole and Kent Flannery, in the 1960s. It contained a thick Upper Paleolithic sequence which yielded bladelets and tools. A number of C14 dates indicate that the site was occupied mainly between 30 and 35 thousand years ago. Hole and Flannery published some results of their excavation at Yafteh in a general paper about their excavations in prehistoric sites in Loristan and Dehluran. The lithic assemblages from 1967 excavations were re-analyzed in 2005 by Bordes and Shidrang and later those assemblages were the main subject of a MA thesis in 2007. The site was re-excavated in 2005 by a joint Belgian-Iranian team directed by Marcel Otte and Fereidoun Biglari and excavated again by Otte and Sonia Shidrang in 2008.

Based largely on the Curtiss Hawk 75, it was of mixed construction with wooden three-spar wings, welded steel tube fuselage and plywood skinning. It could carry up to four 20 mm cannons underwing, and had capacity to carry bombs via a centreline bomb rack, allowing it to function as a dive bomber. Operational history It was anticipated that the X-PO would be produced in series at AFAMF No. 1 factory at Kunming, however the prototype was flown for the first time in 1943, at Yangling. After circling the airfield, the X-PO landed too fast, ground-looped and was written off.

History and etymology The holotype is a right tarsometatarsus (NMNZS 22683 in the collections of the National Museum) collected on 29 September 1983 from the Honeycomb Hill Cave. The specific epithet honours Dr John Yaldwyn, Director of the National Museum of New Zealand in Wellington, in recognition of his contributions to avian palaeontology. Description It was the largest (by weight) of the New Zealand wrens. The morphology of the wren indicates that it was strongly adapted to a terrestrial existence. Radiocarbon dates for the assemblages with which it is associated range from 25,000 BP to 1,000 BP. Either flightless or nearly so, it became extinct following the occupation of New Zealand by the Polynesian ancestors of the MƒÅori, and the associated introduction of the kiore (Pacific rat). Distribution and habitat The subfossil remains of the wren have only been found in the South Island of New Zealand, and it seems to have formed a species pair with the closely related P. jagmi, which was only found in the North Island. Since it has been found in association with four other species of acanthisittids in four genera (at the Honeycomb Hill Cave site) it is likely that its ecological niche was different enough for it to have coexisted with them. Sites where it was found indicate that it inhabited lowland mixed podocarp broadleaf forest, ranging upwards into alpine tundra scrubland.Millener (1988).

Wellh√∂fer, Embedded Linux mit Nano- XMicrowindows 0.9 on ARM Linux or a PDA. It is an Open Source project aimed at bringing the features of modern graphical windowing environments to smaller devices and platforms. The project was renamed from Microwindows due to legal threats from Microsoft regarding the Windows trademark. Overview The Nano-X Window System is extremely portable, and completely written in C. It has been ported to the Intel 16, 32 and 64 bit CPUs, the Broadcom BCM2837 ARM Cortex-A53, as well as MIPS R4000 (NEC Vr41xx) StrongARM and PowerPC chips found on handheld and pocket PCs. The Nano-X Window System currently runs on Linux systems with kernel framebuffer support, or using an X11 driver that allows Microwindows applications to be run on top of the X Window desktop. This driver emulates all of Microwindows' truecolor and palette modes so that an application can be previewed using the target system's display characteristics directly on the desktop display, regardless of the desktop display characteristics. In addition, it has been ported to Windows, Emscripten, Android (based on the Allegro library), and MS-DOS. Microwindows screen drivers have been written based on the SDL1 and SDL2 libraries plus the Allegro and SVGALib libraries. There are also a VESA and a VGA 16 color 4 planes driver. Architecture=Layered Design Microwindows Architecture Microwindows is essentially a layered design that allows different layers to be used or rewritten to suit the needs of the implementation.P. Raghavan, Embedded Linux System Design and Development At the lowest level, screen, mouse/touchpad and keyboard drivers provide access to the actual display and other user-input hardware. At the mid level, a portable graphics engine is implemented, providing support for line draws, area fills, polygons, clipping and color models. At the upper level, three API's are implemented providing access to the graphics applications programmer. Currently, Microwindows supports the Xlib, Nano-X and Windows Win32/WinCE GDI APIs. These APIs provide close compatibility with the Win32 and X Window systems, however, with reduced functionality. These APIs allow programs to be ported from other systems easily. Device Drivers The device driver interfaces are defined in device.h. A given implementation of Microwindows will link at least one screen, mouse and keyboard driver into the system. The mid level routines in the device-independent graphics engine core then call the device driver directly to perform the hardware-specific operations. This setup allows varying hardware devices to be added to the Microwindows system without affecting the way the entire system works. Application programmer interfaces Microwindows currently supports three different application programming interfaces (APIs). This set of routines handles client‚Äìserver activity, window manager activities like drawing title bars, close boxes, etc., as well as handling the programmer's requests for graphics output. These APIs run on top of the core graphics engine routines and device drivers. =NX11 API= The NX11 API is compliant with the X Window API. It is based on the Nano-X API and provides Xlib functions using the functions available in the Nano-X API. It can be compiled as a separate library or together with Nano-X library as a single library called libPX11. In all it provides 180 Xlib functions and stubs for additional functions not implemented. Based on the NX11 API the FLTK graphical user interface library can be used to provide a GUI for application programs. The Nanolinux distribution uses the NX11 API and FLTK to implement a Linux operating system using 19 MB of disk space. =Nano-X API= The Nano-X AP is modeled after the mini-x server written initially by David Bell, which was a reimplementation of X on the MINIX operating system. It loosely follows the X Window System Xlib API, but the names all being with GrXXX() rather than X...(). The basic model of any API on top of Microwindows is to initialize the screen, keyboard and mouse drivers, then hang in a select() loop waiting for an event. When an event occurs, if it is a system event like keyboard or mouse activity, then this information is passed to the user program converted to an expose event, paint message, etc. If it is a user requesting a graphics operation, then the parameters are decoded and passed to the appropriate GdXXX engine routine. Note that the concept of a window versus raw graphics operations is handled at this API level. That is, the API defines the concepts of what a window is, what the coordinate systems are, etc., and then the coordinates are all converted to \\"screen coordinates\\" and passed to the core GdXXX engine routines to do the real work. This level also defines graphics or display contexts and passes that information, including clipping information, to the core engine routines. =Microwindows API= The API which tries to be compliant with the Microsoft Win32 and WinCE GDI standard is the Microwindows API.Linux + Microwindows: challenger to WinCE Currently, there is support for most of the graphics drawing and clipping routines, as well as automatic window title bar drawing and dragging windows for movement. The Microwindows API is message- based, and allows programs to be written without regard to the eventual window management policies implemented by the system. The Microwindows API is not currently client/server. The fundamental communications mechanism in the Microwindows API is the message. A message consists of a well-known message number, and two parameters, known as wParam and lParam. Messages are stored in an application's message-queue, and retrieved via the GetMessage function. The application blocks while waiting for a message. There are messages that correspond to hardware events, like WM_CHAR for keyboard input or WM_LBUTTONDOWN for mouse button down. In addition, events signaling window creation and destruction WM_CREATE and WM_DESTROY are sent. In most cases, a message is associated with a window, identified as an HWND. After retrieving the message, the application sends the message to the associated window's handling procedure using DispatchMessage. When a window class is created, its associated message handling procedure is specified, so the system knows where to send the message. The message-passing architecture allows the core API to manage many system functions by sending messages on all sorts of events, like window creation, painting needed, moving, etc. By default, the associated window handling function gets a \\"first pass\\" at the message, and then calls the DefWindowProc function, which handles default actions for all the messages. In this way, all windows can behave the same way when dragged, etc., unless specifically overridden by the user. Major window management policies can be redefined by merely re-implementing DefWindowProc, rather than making changes throughout the system. The basic unit of screen organization in Microwindows API is the window. Windows describe an area of the screen to draw onto, as well as an associate \\"window procedure\\" for handling messages destined for this window. Applications programmers can create windows from pre-defined classes, like buttons, edit boxes, and the like, or define their own window classes. In both cases, the method of creating and communicating with the windows remains exactly the same. History Nano-X's origin is with NanoGUI. NanoGUI was created by Alex Holden by taking David Bell's mini-X server and Alan Cox's modifications and adding client/server networking. Gregory Haerr then took interest in the NanoGUI project and began making extensive enhancements and modifications to NanoGUI. Around version 0.5, Gregory Haerr added support for multiple API's, and began distributing Microwindows. In Microwindows 0.84, all previous NanoGUI changes were incorporated and since then has been the combined NanoGUI/Microwindows distribution. In January 2005, the system changed its name to the Nano-X Window System. Because Nano-X just loosely follows the X Window System Xlib API, an additional interface was developed named NXlib, which provides an Xlib compatible API based on Nano-X.
