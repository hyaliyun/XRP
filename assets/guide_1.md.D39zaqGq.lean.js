Ferdinand von Mueller described the plant as Streptothamnus beckleri from collections at the Clarence River. Description The Berberidopsis Beckleri belongs to one of the three species of the family Berberidopsidaceae. The family Berberidopsidaceae belongs with the monotypic Aextoxicaceae to the order Berberidopsidales. This plant, is unusual for the core eudicots because they have been placed in the same order to the divergence of Asterids, Caryophyllales, and Santalales Morphology Berberidopsis beckleri is a vine growing. New shoots are produced every year which contribute to the developing of flowers in the axils of leaves before it turns vegetative and producing twining stems. = Flowers = The flowers of Berberidopsis have a spiral phyllotaxis. They don't have a clear way to distinguish the bracts, sepals and petals. The flowers appear separate from anything else and pendent on long pedicels in the axil of an ovate leaf. The contain a progressive loss of red pigmentation from the outside towards the inner perianth parts. Flowers display a spirally arranged perianth, which increase in size from the bracts to the inner tepals = Petals = The petals are the number of perianth parts including bracts that varies between 13 and 16. They have a truncate apex. = Inner petaloid tepals = The inner petaloid tepals are larger in size than the outer tepal. This tepal creates an urceolate structure which enclose the sexual organs from the plants. = Stamens = The stamens are arranged in a single sequence with filaments which supports the anther. Stamen number varies between 8, 11, and 13. Stamens are surrounded by a crenelated disc nectary. = Ovary = The ovary is the female organ, contains ovule which develops into seeds. Ovary is elliptical, with a massive style and green stigma lobes. = Leaves = The leaves are simple, ovate to broad–ovate, alternate, palmately veined. They are usually 3 cm to 6 cm long. leaves are soft and thin, with a hairy look-like structure in the midvein and lowest veins. = Fruits = The fruits develop into berries surrounded by a persistent disc of style and stigma. they usually produce between 100 to 200 seeds. Species The genus of Berberidopsis has two species: * Berberidopsis beckleri Was originally described as Streptothamnus beckleri by Von Mueller, in 1862. However, in 1984 Veldkamp moved the species to Berberidopsis on the basis of strong similarities in seed anatomy, pollen and wood, which are clearly different in Streptothamnus moorei. <, a montane tape vine of Australia. * Berberidopsis corallina Occupies a crucial position in the core eudicots regarding the origin of pentamery and the evolution of a bipartite perianth. They are considered as the coral plant of Chile, a threatened woody vine. The stems are used in traditional basketry by southern Mapuche people. Distribution Berberidopsis beckleri is found in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. With the Australian monotypic genus Streptothamnus, Berberidopsis makes up the family Berberidopsidaceae Berberidopsis corallina is found in two different countries, which are the Patagonian sections of Chile and Argentina. = Habitat = This kind of plants grow and distribute in cooler Rainforest such as, the north from the Barrington Tops area. = Occurrence = Berbetidopsis beckleri were found for the very first time in three natural parks: * Australian National Botanic Gardens, Canberra * Dorrigo National Park * Junuy Juluum National Park References Classen-Bockhoff R, Bull-Hereñu K. 2013.

What is known about him, is he seized the tyranny from the Archaeanactids either peacefully or by force, possibly using his background to get control of the Bosporan army. He also held trade agreements with the Athenians, though not to the extent of his grandson Leukon. He was however, spoken of during an audience of Athenians in the years 395-390 BCE, spoken of how he took thought of the Athenians as the most \\"important of the Greeks\\" and provided them first with his grain. He also played a smaller, yet notable part in the Bosporan wars of expansion, a series of wars and conflicts that would expand his dynasty's realm. Succession Spartokos was succeeded by his sons Seleukos and Satyros who jointly reigned together. Satyros continued his father's aggressive policy of expansion and his grandson after him, creating a powerful kingdom in the Cimmerian Bosporus.

He critically evaluates the views of authors such as the physician Magnus Hirschfeld and Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. The book received positive reviews, crediting LeVay with providing a fair and well written assessment of scientific theories about the development of homosexuality and showing how scientific research influences public perceptions of gay people. However, critics argued that LeVay was biased in favor of biological explanations of homosexuality, questioned his view that they would benefit gay people and his suggestion that homosexuality is associated with \\"sex a-typical characteristics\\" and that gay men have some traits more typical of females than of males, and faulted him for ignoring scientific literature relevant to the \\"nature versus nurture\\" controversy. Summary LeVay discusses the development of sexual orientation, and the social and political implications of research on the topic. He critically evaluates theories about homosexuality put forward by authors such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Magnus Hirschfeld, and Sigmund Freud, and discusses efforts to convert gay people to heterosexual, such as those described by the psychologist M. P. Feldman and the psychiatrist M. J. MacCulloch in Homosexual Behaviour: Therapy and Assessment (1971). Publication history Queer Science was first published in 1996 by MIT Press. Reception =Mainstream media= Queer Science received positive reviews from Genevieve Stuttaford and Sybil S. Steinberg in Publishers Weekly, William Beatty in Booklist, Gregg Sapp in Library Journal, and the neurologist Richard Cytowic in The Washington Post, and a mixed review from the historian Roy Porter in The New York Times Book Review. The book was also reviewed by Gail Vines in New Scientist and Jon Turney in the Times Higher Education Supplement and discussed by the philosopher Michael Ruse in The Times Literary Supplement and James Edward Van Buskirk in Library Journal. Stuttaford and Steinberg credited LeVay with deftly explaining \\"biological arcana for the layperson\\" and showing a \\"full grasp\\" of both non-medical and medical historical information. They found the most interesting aspect of the book to be LeVay's \\"survey of research in Berlin at the turn of the century.\\" Beatty credited LeVay with demonstrating \\"how research reports have been properly and improperly used to promote either scientific growth or biased attitudes.\\" Though he noted that Queer Science sometimes made for difficult reading, he considered the text \\"well-thought-out and documented\\" as well as fair. Sapp described the book as thoughtful and objective. He credited LeVay with showing how scientific research into homosexuality effects public perceptions of gay people. Cytowic wrote that LeVay's discussion of the causes of homosexuality was thorough and fair and would be \\"widely regarded as authoritative\\". He credited LeVay with carefully assessing the scientific evidence and the assumptions behind theories, and with writing well, and endorsed his conclusion that \\"homosexuals are created differently from straights\\". Porter considered LeVay's book \\"lucid, approachable and candid\\" and credited him with providing \\"a fine historical sketch of homosexual advocacy and sex research\\", and offering \\"a witty and withering critique\\" of Freudian explanations of homosexuality. However, he considered LeVay naive to believe that proof that homosexuality is rooted in the brain would convince a hostile public to accept homosexuality, writing that evidence LeVay himself provides shows otherwise. He wrote that LeVay \\"looks forward to the day when the 'new eugenics' born of the human genome project will enable women to abort fetuses likely to be carrying any traits they don't much care for, including homosexuality.\\" He found Queer Science to be a dispiriting comment about the state of science. He wrote that LeVay and other researchers were guilty of making \\"bigger and bigger claims based on minuscule amounts of research\\", and called the underlying assumptions of LeVay's work, such as that all people can be categorized as heterosexuals or homosexuals, simplistic. Van Buskirk wrote that the book was usefully complemented by the philosopher Timothy F. Murphy's Gay Science (1997). =Gay media= Queer Science received a negative review from the physician Lawrence D. Mass in Lambda Book Report. The book was also reviewed by the gay writer Gabriel Rotello in The Advocate and discussed by the psychiatrist Vernon Rosario in The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide. Karen Oslund interviewed LeVay about his work, including Queer Science, in The Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review. Mass characterized LeVay as a \\"gay-positive\\" essentialist. Though he noted that LeVay considered possible negative consequences of, and arguments against, the idea that homosexuality is biologically based, he still concluded that LeVay's belief that biological explanations of homosexuality would benefit gay people was \\"unsupported, if not naive\\". He found LeVay's \\"flirtations with social constructionist and other criticisms\\" unsatisfactory. He criticized LeVay for viewing The Twilight of the Golds, a play by Jonathan Tolins \\"about a near-future that offers genetic testing for homosexuality\\", as a personal criticism, and for dismissing the psychologist John Paul De Cecco, a critic of biological explanations of homosexuality. Rosario described LeVay's Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why (2010) as a \\"rehashing\\" of Queer Science. =Scientific and academic evaluations= Queer Science received positive reviews from the zoologist Mark Ridley in Natural History magazine, the neuroscientist Dick Swaab in Nature, R. W. Smith in Choice, the philosopher Philip Kitcher in The Sciences, Scott Herness in the Journal of Sex Research, and James C. Woodson in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, and mixed reviews from Christopher D. Horvath in Isis, and Stephanie Kenen in the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences. The book was also reviewed by Domeena C. Renshaw and Harriet S. Meyer in JAMA, Charles Weijer in BMJ, David L. Hull in The Quarterly Review of Biology, the anthropologist Tom Boellstorff and Lawrence Cohen in Scientific American, Carol T. Tully in the Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare, and the philosopher Edward Stein in the Journal of Homosexuality. Ridley praised the book as a fair discussion of scientific findings on homosexuality, and called it \\"intelligent and generous\\". However, he criticized LeVay for ignoring the literature on the \\"nature versus nurture\\" controversy. He also questioned LeVay's attempt to use genetic evidence to support the claim that homosexuality is immutable, arguing that the existence of genes that influence the development of homosexuality does not mean that homosexuality must be immutable. He noted that genes associated with particular behaviors \\"are probably often expressed in the way they influence individuals to respond to their environments\\" and that because a gene could influence the development of homosexuality in various different ways, for example by affecting how open a person is to \\"same-sex seduction\\", genetic evidence might or might not support LeVay's view of homosexuality. He agreed with LeVay that people who accept that homosexuality is genetically based and therefore inevitable tend to have a more positive view of homosexuality, but nevertheless argued that those who accept such a position are basing their views on a scientific misunderstanding, which could have counter-productive results in legal settings. Swaab considered the book a fine historical introduction to the issue of sexual orientation. However, he wrote that LeVay made selective use of research data. Smith described the book as fair and well-written, and credited LeVay with covering a wide range of topics. Kitcher wrote that LeVay \\"considers criticisms of the recent findings in a thoughtful and balanced manner\\" and \\"takes great pains to consider possible abuses of those findings.\\" He agreed with LeVay's view that basing \\"homosexuality in biology\\" does not constrain freedom for gay people. However, he expressed skepticism about LeVay's view that genetic techniques would make it possible to prevent homosexuality. Herness credited LeVay with exposing the biases of scientists, and praised him for his discussion of Hirschfeld. Although he criticized LeVay for failing to discuss some topics, such as religion and lesbianism, in greater detail, he concluded that Queer Science is \\"a wonderful book, lucidly written and educational.\\" Woodson, writing in 2003, commented that the book \\"remains thought-provoking, controversial, and relevant to the ongoing debate\\" over sexual orientation, and wrote that like LeVay's previous hypothalamus study, it influenced popular views about the biological basis of homosexuality. He considered the book well organized and scholarly, and credited LeVay with thoroughly addressing the social implications of research on homosexuality and fairly discussing the various theories about homosexuality, despite his bias in favor of biological explanations. However, he found LeVay less balanced when discussing conversion therapy. He wrote that LeVay largely avoided \\"the issues of learning and reinforcement relevant to sexual motivation\\". He also questioned LeVay's assumption that masculinity and femininity are \\"functional opposites\\" rather than \\"independent constructs\\", and that \\"brain sexual differentiation is a global phenomenon in which the whole brain is either masculinized and defeminized or remains feminine\\". He wrote that LeVay's view that feminine traits are associated with male homosexuality created a basis for stereotyping, and failed to explain the behavior of non-effeminate gay men. He suggested that some of LeVay's ideas had anti-feminist implications, and that LeVay underestimated \\"the dangers inherent in interpreting correlational relationships between brain structures and ill-defined sample groups\\". He also concluded that LeVay's view that demonstrating that homosexuality has a biological basis would help overcome prejudice against gay people was unlikely to be correct. Horvath described the book as one of the best works on the history of scientific research on homosexuality, writing that it was \\"well- researched and compellingly told\\", and that LeVay provided a \\"detailed and extremely moving\\" account of the \\"horrific consequences\\" of some theories of homosexuality for gay people, including unsuccessful attempts to alter homosexuality through various forms of treatment. However, he also disputed many of LeVay's conclusions \\"about the nature of homosexuality and about the usefulness of biological explanations in the struggle for gay rights\\". He considered it regrettable that LeVay's view of homosexuality was little different from the \\"third sex\\" model proposed by Hirschfeld in 1896, argued that LeVay's view that gay men have certain traits more typical of females than of males is based on an \\"uncritical view of gender\\" that fails to distinguish between sex and gender, and wrote that his claim that he was the first person to report on anatomical differences between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men was incorrect. Kenen considered the book well written and accessible to lay readers, but uneven in quality. She maintained that while LeVay's chapter on the brain and his chapter on genetics were useful, LeVay’s bias in favor of biological explanations distorted his presentation of older psychological theories, and his \\"ahistorical sensibility\\" distorted his discussion of science in its social context. She faulted LeVay's discussions of psychoanalysis and social learning theories, writing that they \\"show a remarkably unsophisticated understanding\\" of the relevant scientific, social, and methodological issues, and that \\"LeVay’s ridicule of psychological theories of human sexuality add nothing to our understanding of the historical or intellectual contexts of such approaches.\\" She suggested that LeVay was biased by his position as a \\"white gay male scientist\\", and that his \\"assumptions about what constitutes homosexuality\\" were \\"historically contingent.\\" She argued that while LeVay considered homosexuality part of a \\"package\\" of \\"sex a-typical characteristics\\", his assumptions about what constituted \\"sex-typical\\" characteristics were unexamined and unconvincing. She found LeVay to be naive to believe \\"in the power of so-called objective modern science to overcome moral and religious intolerance\\", and wrote that he \\"contributes little to the pressing theoretical, historical, and social debates\\" surrounding \\"scientific research on human sexual behavior.\\" Murphy described LeVay's suggestion that modifications in a person's INAH 3 might affect their sexual orientation as speculation. He noted that while LeVay argues that aborting a pregnancy likely to result in a gay child should not be made illegal, other commentators were less willing to accept such a position. He also argued that while LeVay believes that the study of animal sexual behavior will help make society more tolerant of homosexuality, it was uncertain that it would and if it did, this \\"should not be because descriptions of the behavior of animals have normative force in regard to the behavior of human beings.\\" The biologist Paul R. Ehrlich credited LeVay with providing an \\"excellent summary\\" of the views of Ulrichs and Freud.

Over the three years Singh served in that role, taxes and overall spending increases were contained within the school district's budgets each year. Freeholder Election Singh announced his intention to run for Burlington County Freeholder in March 2017 with running mate Tom Pullion. During the course of the campaign, Singh criticized the Burlington County Freeholder Board for focusing on bringing warehouse jobs to the region, stating that these types of businesses attract unskilled laborers and create traffic in local communities. Singh was criticized by his Republican opponents for his support of tax increases while on the Burlington Township Board of Education and for his support of gubernatorial candidate Phil Murphy. The Republicans also ran social media ads claiming that Singh would harbor criminal immigrants and support sanctuary city policies if elected. Singh stated after the election that such immigration policies fall out his jurisdiction as a Freeholder, and therefore were irrelevant points to be made. Singh and Pullion were endorsed by Levi Sanders, son of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who helped the pair raise funds for their campaign. In October 2017, it was revealed by the Burlington County Times that the Burlington County Democratic Committee sent more funds outside of the county to assist New Jersey Senate President Stephen M. Sweeney than they spent within the county to support Singh and Pullion's election. On election day, Singh and Pullion were declared the victors by a narrow margin in an election where voter turnout was at a record low.Krebs, Rose. \\"Democrats declare upset in county freeholder race; Republicans will not concede\\", Burlington County Times, November 8, 2017.

The oath of office was administered by Central New Jersey politician Vin Gopal, who was then Senator-Elect for New Jersey's 11th Legislative District. Gopal is the first Indian-American to be elected to New Jersey's State Senate, Singh voted in favor of the 2018 County budget, which resulted in a reduction in property taxes. The budget also called for a cut in the amount of money going into the Burlington County farmland preservation and open space fund since only two farms had applied for the program during the 2018 fiscal year, and neither accepted the county’s offer. At the March 19, 2018 Board of Chosen Freeholders meeting, Republican Freeholders introduced a resolution to expand the Burlington County Women's Advisory Council's size from 15 to 20 members. Freeholders Singh and Pullion expressed concern that current members were being dismissed and that new members were being chosen without a public advertisement of the vacancies. The resolution passed along a party-line vote. On June 13, 2018, Singh and Pullion cast dissenting votes on a motion to grant an $89,500 contract for architectural services for security studies within the schools of Burlington County. During the meeting, a resident addressed the Board and alleged that the firm had donated to Republican campaigns in the past.Minutes, June 13th, 2018, Item j and 2 Singh and Pullion cited the firm that was granted the contract, alleging that the appointment was made for political reasons. In January 2019, Singh joined with fellow Democrats on the Freeholder Board to rescind the County's so-called \\"double dipper ban,\\" which would prohibit Burlington County from employing any individual already collecting a taxpayer- funded pension unless they agreed to freeze their pension payments. Singh argued that the ban prevented hiring experienced individuals for publicly funded jobs within the county.

As of August 01, 2012, D&H; Cattle was making a big push for Shepherd Hills Tested to win the American Bucking Bull, Inc., (ABBI) Classic Championship. He had impressed the judges the most this season at Classic events, which are events held for 3 and 4-year-olds by the ABBI. The bull was also a fan favorite. However, bull riders were finding him tough to ride due to his power. He had thrown off such notable riders as J.B. Mauney, Chris Shivers, Austin Meier, and Ryan Dirteater. ABBI Executive Director Kaycee Simpson noticed that the Pages, owners of D&H; Cattle, were hauling Shepherd Hills Tested to every classic event they could. They had already earned $50,000 with him as of August 2012. That year in Las Vegas, Nevada, the 3 or 4-year-old bull with the highest score was to win $250,000 for first place. Simpson said of Tested, \\"We want the best Classic bull in the world to win...The caliber of Classic bulls is that high this year. He has some stiff competition.\\" In the end, Shepherd Hills Tested secured a win for the ABBI Classic Championship as a 4-year-old in 2012. In his entire Classic career (competing as a 3 and 4-year-old in the ABBI), the bull pulled down a total of $339,570.39. In September 2012 at a PBR BFTS event in Nashville, Tennessee, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Aaron Roy in 3.35 seconds for a bull score of 44.50 points. In September 2012 at a PBR BFTS event in Springfield, Missouri, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off HD Coleman in 2.57 seconds for a bull score of 44.25 points. In September 2012 at a PRCA event in Omaha, Nebraska, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Trevor Kastner in 4.23 seconds for a bull score of 44 points. In September 2012, Mauney made a qualified ride on Shepherd Hills Tested; he was the first rider ever to do so. The ride took place at a PBR BFTS event in Springfield, Missouri. Mauney scored 92.50 points out of a possible 100 on Shepherd Hills Tested, whose bull score was a solid 45.25 out of a possible 50. The ride won the event for Mauney. The bull turned in the rider's left hand nicely. This let Mauney gain the bull's rhythm while the bull attempted to outpower him in the front end. Co-owner H.D. Page of D&H; Cattle said when Tested got upset when a rider made a qualified ride on him and he got beat. \\"The bull doesn't believe he did his job right. So the next time he goes out, his desire to win is stronger.\\" Page explained that Shepherd Hills Tested usually proved himself after such a loss by winning rebound events. As an example, in September 2012, Mauney rode Shepherd Hills Tested for 92.5 points at the PFIwestern.com Invitational presented by Bass Pro Shops in Springfield, Missouri. After that, the 3-year-old bull bounced back at a rodeo in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to buck off Brant Atwood in 4 seconds for 46.5 points. In October 2012 at the PBR BFTS Finals at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, Shepherd Hills Tested competed two times. His first out was against Davi Henrique where he bucked him off in 4.75 seconds for a bull score of 43.75. Next, he bucked off Mauney in 4.76 seconds for a bull score of 46 points. In December 2012, at the National Finals Rodeo, at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, Shepherd Hills Tested competed two times. First, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off PRCA World Champion Cody Teel in 4 seconds for an exceptional bull score of 47 points. Next, he bucked off Trevor Kastner in 4 seconds with another exceptional bull score of 47 points. This performance at the NFR brought Shepherd Hills Tested the PRCA Bucking Bull of the NFR Finals title. =2013 season= On January 25 and 26, 2013, Shepherd Hills Tested competed at the PBR BFTS WinStar World Casino Invitational at the Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. PBR bull rider Jory Markiss failed to ride Tested on Friday night the 25th when he was bucked off in 2.61 seconds, and Tested earned a bull score of 44.50 points. Markiss got a second chance that night because he won the round and Tested was the bonus bull for the round winner. The bonus round was worth $3,000. Markiss got bucked off again, this time in 4.99 seconds, with Shepherd Hills Tested earning a bull score of 45.50 seconds. In February 2013, at a PRCA event in San Antonio, Texas, Shepherd Hills bucked off Parker Breding in 2.20 seconds for bull score of 44 points. In March 2013, in Arlington, Texas, at the PBR BFTS Iron Cowboy event in AT&T; Stadium, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Austin Meier in 1.91 seconds for a career high bull score of 46.75 points, which still stands today. Tested burst out of the bucking chute with Meier on his back so fast that Meier just slipped off. In March 2013, at a PRCA event in Austin, Texas, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Tag Elliot in 1.80 seconds for an outstanding bull score of 48 points. In April 2013, at a PBR BFTS event in Billings, Montana, Mauney and Shepherd Hills Tested met up for the fourth time. Mauney selected the bull in the BFTS championship round draft. Mauney was one of only two riders to ever score a qualified ride on the bull, but was not afraid to admit the bull had embarrassed him several times. \\"That bull is hard to ride,\\" Mauney said. \\"I rode him twice and he shit-canned me a lot of times.\\" Mauney particularly remembers this fourth attempt when Shepherd Hills Tested knocked him unconscious. Tested burst out of the bucking chute fast. \\"He came back to the left and I fell back and all my weight was on my feet and my feet came straight up over him. I was hung upside down the side of him and when he came around he caught me with both back feet and slapped me into the ground\\". Mauney was down and out.\\" The judges marked Shepherd Hills Tested a high score of 45.75 points for his efforts. In another example of Tested's \\"rebound\\" tendency, in October 2013, Mauney rode him in McAlester, Oklahoma. After that, Shepherd Hills Tested turned around and, at his next event on his way to earning the PRCA championship, bucked off Josh Koschel and Trey Benton. In November 2013, at the J.W. Hart PBR Tour Pro Division event in McAlester, Oklahoma, Mauney rode Tested for a qualified ride for the second and last time. Mauney scored 90.50 points, while the bull made a 44-point bull score. The ride came about a month after Mauney won his first world championship in 2013. In June 2013, at a PRCA event in Decatur, Texas, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Randy Quartieri in 1.03 seconds for a bull score of 45 points. In August 2013, at a PRCA event in Castle Rock, Colorado, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Bobby Welsh in 1.30 seconds for a bull score of 45 points. In August 2013 at a PRCA event in Caldwell, Idaho, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off future world champion Cooper Davis in 2.20 seconds for a bull score of 45.50 points. In October 2013, Shepherd Hills Tested competed twice at the PBR BFTS finals that year at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. He scored 46 points bucking off Chase Outlaw in 3.78 seconds and 47.75 points bucking off Markus Mariluch in 1.53 seconds. Shepherd Hills Tested performed so well that year, he took home the 2013 PBR Reserve World Champion Bull title, coming in second to Bushwacker. In December 2013, Shepherd Hills Tested competed in the finals of the PRCA, the NFR, which took place at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. His first out took place against Josh Koshel, where Tested bucked him off in 4 seconds for a bull score of 45 points. Next, Tested took on Trey Benton, whom he also bucked off in 4 seconds, and garnered a bull score of 44 points. Shepherd Hills Tested performed so well that year, he took home the 2013 PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year title. The year 2013 was one of the bull's best years. He had a 26-0 record across of levels of competition, as well as a 13-0 record on the BFTS. =2014 season= In January 2014, at a PBR event in Denver, Colorado, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Chase Outlaw in 4 seconds for a bull score of 46 points. In January 2014, at a PBR event in Pueblo, Colorado, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off 2004 World Champion Mike Lee in 4.70 seconds for a bull score of 44 points. In January 2014, at a PBR BFTS event in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Joao Ricardo Viera in 4.4 seconds for a bull score of 40.50 points. In January 2014, at PBR BFTS event in Sacramento, California, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Austin Meier in 4.05 seconds for a bull score of 45.25 points. In February 2014, at a PBR BFTS event in Anaheim, California, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Matt Triplett in 2.21 seconds for a bull score of 38.75. Again at that same event, Tested bucked off Mauney in 5.17 seconds for a bull score of 43.75. In March 2014, at an event in Arlington, Texas, Shepherd Hills Tested, bucked off three-time world champion Silvano Alves in 2.13 seconds for a bull score of 45 points. In March 2014, at a PBR BFTS event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Brady Sims in 4.07 seconds for a bull score of 44.75 points. In March 2014, at a PBR BFTS event in Fresno, California, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Tanner Byrne in .98 seconds for a bull score of 45 seconds. At the same event in Fresno, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Valdiron de Oliveira in .86 seconds for a bull score of 44.25 points. In May 2014, at a PBR BTFS event in Colorado Springs, Colorado, he fouled Fabiano Viera who got a reride bull. In May 2014, veteran Kasey Hayes rode Tested for a score of 91.5 points during the PBR BFTS Rumble in the Rockies event in the Broadmoor Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He broke the bull's streak of 21 buckoffs. Shepherd Hills Tested received a bull score of 45 points on that ride. Hayes knew going into the ride that Shepherd Hills Tested was one of the hardest bulls to ride in the PBR and that only Mauney had ridden him twice. Hayes said he was prepared \\"to be on his A game and do everything right\\" so he could score a qualified ride from the bull and avoid injury. \\"It was the perfect ride on a really strong bull,\\" Lambert said. \\"It had to be one of Kasey's career highlights, but it would have been anyone's career highlight because he was so strong when he bucked that if you didn’t ride him perfect you didn't have a chance.\\" Then later that month in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the Last Cowboy Standing PBR BFTS event, Tested had his rebound from Colorado Springs by bucking off Renato Nunes in 5.92 seconds for a bull score of 45.75 points. Next was the J.W. Hart PBR Challenge, beginning Saturday night, May 31, 2014, in Decatur, Texas. The event runs on the PBR Touring Pro Division, which is not as elite as the BFTS tour. However, Hart runs this event every year with as many top ranked bulls as he can get and it always lines up more closely with a BFTS elite tour event. Competing that year in the championship round were bulls like Jack Daniel's After Party, David's Dream, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, Pound the Alarm, and Stone Sober. As a result of Hart's efforts, two-time PBR World Champion J.B. Mauney and four-time PRCA World Bull Riding Champion J.W. Harris were matched against 2012 World Champion Bull Asteroid, and 2013 PRCA Bull of the Year Shepherd Hills Tested. Hart put up $25,000 in a winner-take-all challenge for his event that year. The match between the duo was titled the 1,000 Miles From Home $25,000 winner-take-all challenge. Prior to this event, Shepherd Hills Tested had been ridden for a qualified ride only twice in the last 35 outs (trips out of the bucking chute) and had an average bull score of 44.68 points over his last 38 outs. Tested had already bucked off eight riders in 2014, and had a 94.74 buck off percentage just prior to the Decatur event. His nine challengers by May 2014 included 2013 Rookie of the Year Joao Ricardo Vieira, 2013 World Champion J.B. Mauney and 2010 World Champion Renato Nunes. His ride by Hayes was his only qualified ride. The PBR considered Tested and Asteroid two of the greatest bulls to buck that year. Harris and Mauney, each drew for the two bulls, with Mauney drawing Asteroid, and Harris drawing Tested. \\"Mauney has successfully ridden Shepherd Hills Tested twice in six attempts and conquered Asteroid once in three tries\\". Mauney had made a qualified ride on Asteroid for 93.5 points in 2012. Harris had yet to attempt either bull. All of the bull riding events, including the match-up, occurred at the Wise County Fairgrounds, which was sold out, on Saturday night. It was a long evening of bull riding in the 1,000 Miles From Home $25,000 \\"winner-take-all challenge\\". Mauney was a bit slow to stay in position at the start of the ride, and he was thrown in two seconds by Asteroid, who scored 46 points. The 27-year-old Harris almost rode Tested, hitting the ground at 6.17 seconds. Tested was scored 45 points. At this point in his career, Shepherd Hills Tested had given up only three qualified rides in 74 attempts. Harris lasted the longest of anyone since February 2013 of those who hadn't made eight seconds. He shot out of the bucking chute fast enough for the force to push Harris back and up in his seat. Harris reported, \\"I just kept trying to cut the corner, hoping maybe I could beat him around there every time and I kind of got behind and he stuck me on my head...You can't be mad if you try hard and land on the back of your head. He was just better than I was. You go on from it.\\" After Decatur, Shepherd Hills Tested next bucked at another PBR Touring Pro event at the Stanley Park Fairgrounds in Estes Park, Colorado, in July 2014. He was the main attraction due to heavyweight Bushwacker's absence, since Bushwacker only bucked at BFTS events. Tested took an introductory lap around the arena and was bucking that night as the $1,000 bounty bull. Tested bucked off Montana Hand that evening in 2.97 seconds for a bull score of 45 points. At that same event, Shepherd Hills Tested also bucked off Cody Wood in 4.10 seconds for a bull score of 44 points. The bull finished the first half of the season with a 43.67 point average in nine BFTS outs. Tested scored 45 points or higher three consecutive times. One of which was a 45.75-point bull score bucking off Renato Nunes in 5.92 seconds at Last Cowboy Standing. He was ridden just once in 2014 by Kasey Hayes and had been ridden only two times in 38 outs in the past four years on the BFTS. In July 2014, at a PBR event in Guymon, Oklahoma, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Cody Schneider in 4.32 seconds for a bull score of 45 points. In August 2014, in Castle Rock, Colorado, at a PRCA event, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Joseph Vazquez in 4 seconds for an exceptional bull score of 47 points. In August 2014, at a PRCA event in Caldwell, Idaho, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Tyler Willis in 6.13 seconds for a bull score of 40 points. In August 2014, at a PBR BFTS event in Thackerville, Oklahoma, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Brady Sims in 4.59 seconds for a bull score of 44.25 points. In September 2014, at a PBR BFTS event in Springfield, Missouri, Shepherd Hills Tested bucked off Tyler Harr in 4.37 seconds for a bull score of 44.50 points. Per Lambert, Shepherd Hills Tested was one of eight bulls with a serious chance at the World Champion Bull title that year. Lambert's view is that Shepherd Hills Tested \\"is incredibly strong and gets stronger as he goes...He is just as determined to buck guys off as Bushwacker is. He is not going to let anybody steal a ride on him. They are going to have to do everything perfect on him. If they get a little bit out of shape, they are not going to hang on to the side\\". Page says \\"Tested is going to have to bring his game and everyone else, if they want to knock Bushwacker out, they are going to have to bring their game.\\" Last year, he had 26 outs for both the PBR and the PRCA. He had a career high 13 BFTS buckoffs and reached a personal best average mark of 45.48 points. Shepherd Hills Tested had a total of 74 outs over the last four years at all levels. Page planned on entering Shepherd Hills Tested in many PRCA rodeos that summer, hoping he would qualify for the NFR, as he is the defending PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year. According to Page, Shepherd Hills Tested enjoyed competing and was the kind of bull who performed better the more he worked. In the bucking chute, Tested would lick his lips. There was no hesitation or struggle. Page said. “I know people say this a lot, but he really enjoys what he does.\\" = 2014 PBR Finals = Shepherd Hills Tested made 11 outs in the 2014 season but had only one qualified ride, by Kasey Hayes. Hayes received a score of 91.50 points, and Tested had a buckoff percentage of 90.91 buckoff percentage. The bull has a 38-2 record for his four years on the BFTS. At the end of 2014, Shepherd Hills Tested ranked as of the top 5 bulls in the BFTS and received a second world championship nomination. On October 27, 2014, eight world champion bull contenders were announced for the PBR BFTS World Finals that year. The top 35 bull riders in the world voted to select the contenders. The finalists were Bushwacker, Mick E. Mouse, Asteroid, Air Time, Roy, I'm a Gangster Too, Fire & Smoke, and Shepherd Hills Tested. The bull who scored the highest during the finals became the World Champion Bull. The finals took place on October 22-25, 2014, at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. For Tested's first out at the finals, Kasey Hayes rode Tested for a second time, but it was what the PBR considers a subpar out, with a very low score of 79.25 points and a low bull score of 42.25 points. His other out was with Lachlan Richardson, whom he bucked off in 1.10 seconds, and earned an excellent bull score of 45 points. After completion of the championship round, the winner was announced on October 26. Bushwacker was the World Champion Bull that year, making it his third and last title as it was his final year competing. Shepherd Hills Tested came in second, earning the PBR Reserve World Champion Bull title.  Career summary  Shepherd Hills Tested posted a 39-3 record in his four years on the BFTS tour. He had 80 total buckoffs in all circuits. Seventeen (21.25 percent) of those were against PBR or PRCA champion bull riders. According to the ProBullStats web site, a bull riding compendium that is a sister site to the PBR, Tested has 84 attempts with 4 qualified total outs in all circuits. His buckoff percentage is 95.24 percent. On the BFTS, he has 42 attempts with 3 qualified rides. His BFTS average career score is 44.62 points. And his BFTS historic ranking is 92nd. Tested is ranked 23rd on the Top 500 Bulls by Power Rating list on ProBullStats. His career high bull score on the PBR BFTS series is 46.76 points bucking off Austin Meier in Arlington, Texas, in 1.91 seconds. His career high bull score in the PRCA is 47 points, which he scored four times, including two times at the 2012 National Finals Rodeo. In statements by Lambert, Shepherd Hills Tested was described as not a favorite bull of riders because \\"he was incredibly strong and hard to ride\\". He did make the same moves each out, but the first one was such a strong one that made him very difficult to ride. He had a forward motion out of the chute that he used and \\"he would rear them back and jerk on them really hard\\". But that initial move was not the only thing the rider had to overcome. \\"He was strong while he was turning back. If he needed to, he would spin either way. If he needed to do something different, he would try it\\". Rider Austin Meier, who attempted him without success, was sorry to hear that Shepherd Hills Tested had died. He had respect for Tested. Meier said. \\"I remember how much power and speed he had. He had it all. Power, speed, smarts. He was an athlete.\\" His greatest achievement was in 2013, the year he was voted PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year. He also finished as runner-up to Bushwacker twice, who was the PBR World Champion Bull that year and in 2014. Shepherd Hills Tested bucked in his prime in a time where he was \\"overshadowed by the really outstanding [bulls]. Bushwacker, Asteroid and ones like that. The thing that hurt Tested was he bucked more with power and wasn’t real showy\\". According to Mauney, \\"The way he moved forward, if you weren’t on your A game and out over him, and you were behind, he was going to drill you...He wasn’t the biggest bull you ever seen, but width wise his shoulders would fill up the bucking chutes. Tested kicked hard, but he was more power\\".

In April 2017, Shepherd Hills Tested was living at the facility of part-owner Rod Reid of Shepherd Hills Cutlery when an accident occurred. He got into a fight with another bull, and the two managed to break some fences in the process. Before anyone could get to the scene, Tested made his way off the property through one of the holes in the fence and was on a highway when he was struck by a vehicle. Approximately two weeks after being struck, Tested died on April 14, 2017, as a result of injuries incurred from the accident. Shepherd Hills Tested's son, #A1 Mud Shark, a D&H; Cattle bull, bucked his first season on the BFTS elite tour in 2017. Mauney has made two qualified rides on this bull. In April 2017, in Billings, Montana, Mauney rode Mud Shark for 89.5-points in Round 3. Prior to that, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Mauney rode Mud Shark for 89 points.

Biography The daughter of Robert Harvey, miller, and Sarah Glassford, she was born in Maitland, Upper Canada and was educated in Montreal and Scotland. She returned to the family farm following the death of her mother. In 1859, she married Chilion Jones, the son of Jonas Jones, in Brockville; the couple had seven children. Shortly after their marriage, they moved to Ottawa where her husband, an architect, worked on the construction of the Parliament buildings. At the completion of that project, they returned to Brockville. Harvey operated a small dairy operation there. She began raising purebred Jersey cattle. She established a large herd, which she carefully managed. Taking advantage of the rich milk produced by these cattle, she began producing high quality butter which she was able to sell at a premium price in Canada and the United States. Her Canadian customers included the Rideau Club in Ottawa and the Canadian Pacific Railway. During the 1880s, she began showing her cattle at exhibitions in Ontario, Quebec and New York state, collecting many prizes for her animals. She sold her cattle to buyers across North America, including the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph. She was a regular contributor of articles on farming to various periodicals including the Farmer's Advocate and Home Magazine and the Family Herald and Weekly Star in Montreal. In 1892, published a collection of her columns as Dairying for profit: or, the poor man’s cow, which she dedicated to the farmer's wives of America. The Farmer's Advocate advertised it as \\"the best book ever written\\". A French version Laiterie payante: ou, la vache du pauvre was published in 1894. In 1893, she published a pamphlet Lecture on co-operative dairying and winter dairying. In 1896, she sold half of her herd to a farmer in Prince Edward Island but continued to raise some cattle for her family's use. She also began to raise horses for racing or pulling carriages. She also wrote short stories for publication in the Farmer's Advocate. In the fall of 1902, Harvey travelled to Gananoque where her husband had taken ill. She became ill herself and died there at the age of 64.

Born onscreen, Sass was originally played by an uncredited baby actor in 1993 before Lucy Lovegrove took over the role in 2016. Her early storylines focused on her casual relationship with Hawks Logan (Teone Kahu) and marrying Mason Coutts (Colin Moy) before the relationship turns disastrous and ultimately leading to his death. Sass proved popular amongst the viewers as a \\"beloved\\" character. Creation and casting The character of Sass was introduced in 1993 during a plot in which \\"robo nurse\\" Carrie Burton (Lisa Crittenden) fell pregnant after receiving 3 different sperm donations from central characters. This was billed as a \\"whodunit\\" with nurse Steve Mills (Andrew Binns), Guy Warner (Craig Parker), Dr. Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) and Dr. Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) all potentially being the father. The character made her first appearance on 11 October 1993, when Carrie gave birth to her and her triplet siblings. The birth was used as a storyline to write off the character of Carrie, and she departed with her children on 11 November 1993. In 2015 producers decided to reintroduce the triplets 23 years after their disappearance. Finn (Lukas Whiting) was introduced in early 2016, with the decision to reintroduce the other two triplets throughout the remainder of the year. Lucy Lovegrove was working in a bookstore in Melbourne when she received the offer to play the role of Sass, an experience she referred to as, \\"literally one of those 'my life has changed over night' situations.\\" Joining the soap was said to be, \\"very sudden ... I had six days to pack up my house, quit my job, say goodbye to my flatmates, fly to Canberra to say bye to my family and get to New Zealand. It was so rushed, I don’t think it really hit me until I arrived that I was going to be living in a new country.\\" She believed she won the role due to the fact she \\"looks like Lukas\\" and that he \\"probably looks more like me than my actual brother.\\" Lovegrove was mentored and eventually befriended by co-star Ngahuia Piripi (Esther Samuels). Lovegrove quit the role, with Sass departing in April 2018. Sass brifey returned to the show via a video call on the 2019 season finale. Storylines Desperate to have children but with no stable partner in her life, Shortland Street clinic's head of nursing Carrie Burton (Lisa Crittenden) accepted sperm donations from nurse Steve Mills (Andrew Binns), Guy Warner (Craig Parker), Dr. Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) and Dr. Chris Warner (Michael Galvin); refusing to disclose whose sperm she used. She fell pregnant and married Steve's father Declan Kennedy (Kevin J. Wilson). Carrie gave birth to triplets during good friend Meredith Fleming's (Stephanie Wilkin) leaving party and named them, Frank, Finbar, and Sarah. Declan proved to be a useless father and ended up fleeing the country to escape criminal associates he had, leaving Steve to be a surrogate parent. It turned out Sarah had a hole in her heart and came close to death during surgery. Carrie decided to flee Ferndale after receiving threats from Declan's criminal past, taking her triplets with her and leaving Steve (who had decided the children were likely his) heart broken. Several months later Steve was devastated to realise Chris had discovered he was the father and had been visiting Carrie and the triplets in Australia. This caused a rivalry between the two that ultimately led to Steve driving off the road and dying in an explosion. In November 1995 Chris visited Carrie and the triplets so that he could introduce his father Bruce (Ken Blackburn) to them before he succumbed to terminal cancer. After having a one night stand and not willing to pursue a relationship with a mysterious woman named \\"Sass\\", TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell) was shocked to realise she was Finn Connelly's (Lukas Whiting) triplet sister and long-lost daughter of Chris Warner. Sass quickly made an impression due to her direct and efficient manner, securing herself a position as Chris' executive assistant and making it clear she believed he had failed the triplets as a father. However the Warner family grew close, with Sass moving into the Warner household and getting to know half-brother Harry (Reid Walker). Sass began a casual relationship with Hawks but was devastated when he abandoned her to go to Fiji. Shortly after Sass fell in love with Mayor of Ferndale, Mason and the two wed in a hurried ceremony. Sass began to worry about Mason's manipulative and controlling manner, and was overjoyed when Hawks returned to Ferndale. Soon it became apparent that Mason ran a major criminal organisation and was poisoning Sass, leading her to return to Hawks after he saved her and Mason was arrested. Sass and Hawk's relationship was tested when he cheated on her, but the two found an intimate and forgiving nature between them. Sass struggled with Chris' diagnosis of Leukemia and ultimately changed her surname to Warner to celebrate him. Following Hawk's disclosure of the death of his son, he again abandoned Sass to serve in Syria, and several weeks later Sass received the news he had died in an explosion. Mason escaped from jail and kidnapped Sass and his son Jasper (Lachlan Forlong) on a boat, leading to Jasper dying from a head injury, and Sass murdering Mason with a harpoon gun. Sass escaped charges due to Mason's body deteriorating in the sea, leaving her a widow but away from his reign. She began to casually date Curtis Hannah (Jayden Daniels) but whilst preparing for Finn's wedding, received news that Hawks was in fact alive after months in hiding. She decided to leave Ferndale to care for Hawks in Turkey following the loss of his leg, and bid farewell to Chris and her family. In 2019, however, Hawks mentioned that their relationship is effectively over because his phantom pain was so bad, that it affected their relationship, and she had been in a relationship with a French man. On the 2019 cliffhanger, she appeared via Skype to reveal that she has travelled to Hollywood to see celebrities. Development = Characterization = Sass has a Bachelor of Commerce and has worked a series of different jobs and now works as a personal assistant. Out of her 3 brothers, Sarah is described as the most dominant sibling out of her and her triplet brothers Finn and Frank. It is also said that she is closest to Finn rather than Frank and have a \\"close\\" but \\"competitive\\" relationship. = Warner family unit = The characters of Frank, Finn, and Sass were introduced in 1993 during a whodunit storyline, revolving around sperm donation to the head nurse, Carrie Burton. After departing later in the year, Chris Warner was revealed as the father. The triplets were individually reintroduced 23 years later and instantly bonded with their onscreen father, Michael Galvin. Patrick referred to working with Galvin as \\"pretty fun\\", and labelled him his \\"funny dad\\". He, Whiting, and Lovegrove referred to Galvin as \\"dad\\" onset and Patrick believed, \\"he's a top bloke and really acts like a father figure to us. He always helps us out and gives us guidance, but he can still be the biggest kid out of all us.\\" The chemistry was so apparent between the cast that Whiting blamed Galvin for interrupting filming due to laughter between them. Patrick, Whiting, and Lovegrove were honoured to be a part of the triplet storyline and its history during the show's 25th anniversary, with Whiting believing, \\"it's a pretty special moment to be involved in, especially to be part of a storyline that's been 20 years in the making. And it's definitely cool for the long time fans who remember the triplets being born on the show and can now see that call come to fruition.\\" Patrick and Whiting previously knew each other through acting school, and though Whiting and Lovegrove were of similar age living in Canberra, they were unaware of each other previously. After all three characters returned, there was an instant \\"family\\" connection between the actors with Patrick describing the family as, \\"nothing more than real really\\". The contrast was said to be immense between the often bickering triplets, and the \\"pizza catch ups\\" between the three actors. Lovegrove commented that the relationship between the three had become, \\"a real sibling relationship. We act like real-life triplets!\\" = Mason's revenge = Sass' ex-husband Mason Coutts (Colin Moy) \\"put into motion his revenge plot\\" on Sass and her family when a masked shooter gunned down her brother, Finn, and it later emerges that the shooter was ordered to do so by Mason. Although Mason is in jail he still has a holds a Chris as his \\"arch-enemy\\" and puts into action a revenge plot on the Warner family. Chris originally thought Masons plan was to kill him, but he then realises that Mason wants him to watch his family get punished, which to Chris is much worse. When the shooter puts the gun to Finn's head he says \\"Mason says Merry Christmas\\" shortly after the gunman is pushed out of a window to his death by Chris. Mason escapes prison and is on a boat with his son Jasper and Sass. Mason argues with Sass and he tells Jasper that she is \\"poison\\" and that \\"She'll get inside your heart and weaken it\\". Mason goes to throw Sass off the side of the boat but is interrupted when Jasper attacks him. Jasper gets injured and dies in Masons arms and Mason blames Sass for his death. Sass in a struggle with Mason manages to put a speargun through his throat. The pair struggle and Mason manages to pull Sass into the water where he reveals he has sent a gunman to kill her family. Mason drowns and the boat sails away, leaving Sass treading water in the ocean. Reception The addition of Carrie's triplet storyline was praised for showing a \\"softer side\\" to the otherwise \\"stern matron\\". The return of Finn and his siblings was said to \\"delight\\" Shortland Street fans. Actor Michael Galvin (Dr. Chris Warner) named the triplet's returns in 2016 as his favourite storyline, noting the \\"fun\\" the co-stars have on set. He also aspired for the triplet's to remain on the show for a \\"long time to come\\". The chemistry between Galvin and the three triplet actors, was said to be very genuine and the triplets were so believable it appeared as though they were related in real life. Sass was said to be a \\"beloved\\" character. Following Lovegrove's departure, Galvin called for the actor's return calling the 3 triplet actors \\"fantastic\\" and how he \\"loved working with them.\\" References Shortland Street characters Television characters introduced in 1993 Fictional triplets Female characters in television ","title":"Sass Warner"},{"id":"55954622","text":"Jonathan Carroll is a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives from the 57th district.

It was compiled by Du Gongzhan in the Sui or early Tang (early 7th century) as a revised, annotated edition of Zong Lin's mid-6th-century or Jingchuji. The original Record is now lost; the original text of the Jingchu Suishiji seems to have been lost as well, with current editions consisting of various attempts of Ming and Qing scholars to recover the text from fragments in other works. History Zong Lin Zōng Lǐn, wTsung Lin; 498–561) was a member of the Nanyang immigrants to Jiangling, Hubei, who composed his Record of Jingchu under the Liang.. It seems likely he wrote the book after moving to Chang'an in 554.. Aside from the Jingchu Suishiji and other fragments, the original text is now lost. Du Taiqing Dù Táiqīng, wTu T‘ai-ch‘ing; born ) drew from Zong's work in composing his own seasonal calendar, the Precious Canon of the Jade Candle Yùzhú Bǎodiǎn, wYü-chu Pao-tien), shortly after 581. It survives in an incomplete Japanese manuscript, probably from the 14th century. His nephew Du Gongzhan Dù Gōngzhān, wTu Kung-chan; died after 590). used the Precious Canon to revise and annotate Zong's text sometime in the late Sui or early Tang.. Du's family came from Boling (probably Dingzhou, Hebei) and some of his notes are about the differences in the festivals' observance in northern China.. The original text of this work—in which it is sometimes difficult to distinguish Zong's text from Du's emendations—seems to have been lost under the Song (10th–13th centuries). Surviving editions of the work differ greatly and appear to be Ming and Qing (14th–20th-century) attempts to recreate the work from fragments elsewhere in sources like the Yiwen Leiju and Taiping Yulan. Du died in office as the magistrate of Anyang.. Contents Jingchu was the area reckoned as the former territory of Chu, now mainly in Hubei and Hunan around the middle stretches of the Yangtze River. The Suishiji is an annotated record of its major festivals in the mid-6th to early 7th century, during the chaos of Sui's creation and collapse and just before the stability and grandeur of the Tang. The surviving 37 or so paragraphs also draw from literary sources to outline the history of the festivals as then understood. Some are traced to gods and legendary ancestors, others to agricultural rhythms, and others to historical figures or events. The work also includes irregularly-observed rituals and celebrations concerning disease, bodily functions, marriage, childbirth, dancing, and the exorcism of evil spirits. Importantly, the Jingchu Suishiji records changing Chinese rituals, cuisine, and entertainment as religious and calendrical changes led to a \\"new canon\\" of major festivals. The Chinese New Year, Lantern, Tomb Sweeping, Dragon Boat, Double Seven, Ghost, and Double Ninth Festivals all took most of their present form during the period leading up to the composition of the Jingchu Suishiji. The Double Seven and Double Ninth Festivals reflect the growing use from the late Han onward of monthly dating rather than the old sexagenary cycle of heavenly stems and earthly branches. Similarly, the new reckoning gave added importance to the proper new year festival, which added features from the old popular \\"new year\\" La sacrifices and exorcisms that had occurred in the 12th month after midwinter.. The Jingchu Suishiji is one of the first sources to record the combination of the stories of \\"The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl\\" and Zhang Qian with his magical raft.. Similarly, an edition of the Jingchu Suishiji from the end of the Six Dynasties Period of Chinese history is one of the few sources of the era that mention the Ghost Festival, a Buddhist holiday on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month supposedly started by the disciple Moggallāna to free his dead mother from her status as a hungry ghost. Zong quoted the apocryphal Yulanpen Sutra and described the holiday during his time: people offered temples flowers, flags, and bowls and joined monks and nuns in drumming and singing. Du's commentary on Zong's section about the Cold Food Festival supports the idea that it derived from an old Zhou ritual about banning fire in the capital. during the last month of spring. This derives, however, from an ignorance that the festival had originally been observed around midwinter and continued so as late as the Han. Editions The best edition of the Jingchu Suishiji is that compiled as part of Mitsu Moriya's Study of China's Old Seasonal Records. It has been translated into German by Turban and into Japanese by Moriya & al., which includes helpful commentary. Legacy The Jingchu Suishiji was very influential on writings about the seasons and festivals of China throughout the Tang and Song, being quoted greatly more than any other non-classical text.. The book is sometimes credited as the earliest reference to the Korean traditions concerning red-bean porridge and the beverages that became seju.. The consumption of red-bean porridge around the new year had been common in China in order to stave off disease—particularly smallpox—spread by the pestilent son of the monster Gonggong; the practice spread to Korea under the Goryeo and has continued as part of the Korean New Year celebrations.

The house was designed by Varney Parkes and was built in 1889 by Sir Frederick Darley, Chief Justice of NSW, as his mountain retreat. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The house was named Lilianfels in honour of Darley's daughter who had recently died. Lilian was her name and fels is German for high ground. The Darleys owned the house for twenty years and then sold it. The property is now part of a resort and spa which provides accommodation, restaurant facilities and caters for special events, particularly weddings.  History  Sir Frederick Darley, the Chief Justice of New South Wales and Lieutenant General, had the homestead built in 1889 and named it after one of his daughters, Lilian, who died of typhoid at the age of 22. The family of Ebenezer Vickery, a well-known industrialist, farmer, merchant and benefactor, owned Lilianfels.Johnson, 2012 The homestead now houses a restaurant 'Darley's'. 85 guest rooms were opened in an adjacent hotel in 1992.Goldberg, 2008, 20 =The Darley family= Sir Frederick Darley Sir Frederick Matthew Darley who built Lilianfels was born in Ireland on 18 September 1830. He was the son of Henry Darley who was a part of the Irish Bar. Darley was educated at Dungannon College, County Tyrone, where his uncle, the Rev. John Darley (afterwards Bishop of Kilmore), was headmaster. He went to university and was called in the Bar in 1853. In 1860 he married in Hertfordshire Lucy Forest Browne, an Australian, who at that time was holidaying in England with her brother Thomas Alexander Browne better known as the famous author Rolf Boldrewood. Lucy was the daughter of Captain Sylvester Browne who owned a large house in Sydney called Enmore and a grazing property called Hartlands in Victoria. She was a part of the wealthy social establishment.Obituaries Australia, Thomas Alexander Browne. Online reference After discussions with Sir Alfred Stephen, then Chief Justice of NSW who was visiting his family in England at that time, Darley decided in 1862 to move to Sydney with his family and become a lawyer. He later became a Member of the NSW Parliament and fraternised with many notable people including Sir Edmund Barton who later became the first Prime Minister, Sir John Lackey, Sir William Macarthur, Sir W. Macleay, Sir Arthur Renwick, Sir John Robertson, Sir John Hay and others.Obituaries Australia \\"Sir Frederick Darley\\".

Online reference It was possibly this that helped them to make the decision in 1888 to buy over 11 acres of land adjacent to Echo Point in Katoomba. They built a house for the family over the year of 1889, designed by architect Varney Parkes (son of Henry Parkes). The property was used for a summer residence and nearly every noted visitor to Australia including royalty accepted the Darleys' hospitality to enjoy the magnificent outlook. They were constantly mentioned in the social pages as being the ones to hold house parties at their beautiful residence. In 1894 a social columnist visited the house and gave the following account: In 1907 the Darleys decided to return to England and they sold their houses in Sydney and Katoomba. The advertisement for the sale of Lilianfels is shown. It was sold in 1908 to George Begg Vickery. =Other residents= Albert Alexander Kemp George Begg Vickery and his family used Lilianfels as a summer abode for four years and then sold it to Albert Alexander Kemp (1864-1841). He and his wife Eliza Jane used the house as a permanent residence. They held numerous fetes and fund raising activities on the property and invited friends and others to enjoy the breathtaking views. One journalist described his appreciation of the outlook in the following terms: The Kemps sold the property in 1920 to James Joynton Smith a flamboyant entrepreneur. In 1923 Samuel George Baker bought the house and for the next 30 years leased it to various people as a guest house. It continued to be used as a guest house until 1992 when it a new complex was built on the adjoining block of land. Today the Country House consists of 81 guest rooms and 4 suites with a 19th- century-styled décor, reading room, billiards room and lobby lounge overlooking the Jamison Valley. Darley's restaurant is located within the original summer home.  Description  =Garden/grounds= The current garden is an interpretation of the earlier 19th century garden determined by and functional requirements based on archival photographs. Edging tiles found on site have been utilised and additional tiles introduced as necessary. The former pinetum or area defined as \\"ornamental trees and shrubs\\" consists of plantings of conifers, Arbutus sp., azaleas, camellias, swamp cypress (Taxodium distichum) and Prunus. The cherry laurel hedge (Prunus laurocerasus) which features in a photograph, has been retained. A visible connection to the street and interpretation of the early entrance drive has been retained on the eastern side of the property. The gardens and grounds are largely overgrown. Remains of the driveway, paths and garden beds are discernible by edging tiles and changes of level. There are remains of brick drains, hedges, rock edging, steps and gates. The driveway is flanked by rhododendrons and laurels. Close to the house are plantings of hydrangeas and agapanthus. The grounds contain many exotic plants, dense groves of pine trees and an area once used as a tennis court. =House= The main house is a substantial timber framed weatherboard bungalow building on a red brick base, a rectangular hipped slate roof with brick chimneys punctuated by dormers on the front and rear, lighting attic bedrooms. Dormers facing towards the Jamison Valley have an unusual faceted configuration and small open spaces in front of them. Chimneys are tall and constructed out of brickwork that has been distinctively detailed with strapwork and also tuckpointed. The corners of the external walls have been unusually detailed with quoins. Several wide verandahs surround it; the main one along the front and the two sides feature turned timber posts with decorative timber fretwork valances and railings. The side verandah features a coloured leadlight window. The verandahs feature substantial turned posts, timber balustrading, turned valance joinery and exposed rafter ends. The treads of the steps up to the verandah have been formed from single pieces of slate, whilst risers have been tiled. The main entry is located beyond a gable roofed porch that projects beyond the verandah. =Outbuildings= The originally detached weatherboard kitchen block has been linked to the main house by an enclosed passageway. Its roofline follows the form of the main house roof. The detached cottage, The Kennels is built of weatherboard similarly to the main house, though it is not as elaborate. The shed is a simple rustic building of timber with a skillion roof.(AHC)  Heritage listing  Lilianfels has historic and social significance as the core remnant estate comprising a summer residence built for Sir Frederick Darley, Chief Justice, Lieutenant Governor of NSW and then Privy Counsellor, and Lady Darley. The house has aesthetic significance as a fine example of a late Victorian/ early Queen Anne house designed by Varney Parkes and remains substantially intact. Some of the original interior finishes remain and thus it is a good example of a house and lifestyle of the period. The site comprises the house, kitchen, cottage and extensive gardens, all of which provide an attractive setting and have high aesthetic value for a complex which demonstrates the characteristics of a summer residence in the Blue Mountains. The gardens and grounds have historic significance as remnants of Chief Justice Darley's 1880s estate at Echo Point. The gardens and grounds of Lilianfels, although substantially altered, still contain some important elements of the original layout and demonstrate the key characteristics of the late 19th century summer estates developed in the Blue Mountains by wealthy and prominent citizens of Sydney. The exotic trees, hedges and vistas to Lilianfels house are important to the understanding of the historical development of Echo Point. The location and orientation of the house near Echo Point and overlooking the Jamison Valley and set within attractive gardens provides an outstanding aesthetic appeal for the house, setting, and locality. The remnant estate has been an important part of Katoomba for its historic and social associations.Eric Martin & Associates, 2003, modified, Read, Stuart, 2004 An important late Victorian summer residence built for Sir Frederick Darley, Chief Justice and Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales and Lady Darley (Criterion H.1). The house is architecturally significant as the work of Varney Parkes, later government architect, in an early version of the Queen Anne style (Criterion F.1). The house, kitchen block, detached cottage, mature garden and the prospect over Jamison Valley are highly valued for their aesthetic qualities (Criterion F.1). The complex is important for the way it demonstrates the characteristics of summer residences built in the Blue Mountains in the late nineteenth century by prominent figures of New South Wales (NSW) society (Criterion D.2). It is valued by the community for its historic and social associations and for its later role as a popular guest house (Criterion G.1). Lilianfels was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

(Adèle) Henriette Negrin, (or Nigrin), born on October 4, 1877 in Fontainebleau, died in 1965 in Venice, was a French clothes-designer and textile arts artist. She created fabrics and clothes, and worked alongside her husband Mariano Fortuny. Biography Henriette Negrin met Mariano Fortuny in Paris at the beginning of the 20th century and, in 1902, went to live with him in Venice at the Palazzo Pesaro degli Orfei, now Palazzo Fortuny, one of the museums of the city.Palazzo Fortuny museum site Henriette Negrin and her husband shared an interest for textile creations. In particular, she researched pigments for the dying of fabrics, applying the dyes herselfHenriette Fortuny: ritratto di una musa, La Donna dietro l'Artista, p.9 to the wood stencils for printing the textiles. Together, they developed a pleating machine the patent for which was filed by the National Institute of Industrial Property (France) of Paris on June 10, 1909. In a signed hand- written note on a copy of the patent (copy kept at the Marciana Library), Mariano Fortuny acknowledged his future wife as the inventor of the machine: \\" Ce brevet est de la propriété de Madame Henriette BrassartBrassart was the name of Henriette's mother qui est l’inventeur. J’ai pris ce brevet en mon nom pour l’urgence du dépôt.\\" (\\"This patent is the property of Madame Henriette Brassart who is the inventor. I submitted this patent in my name given the urgency of filing\\"). This pleating technique plays a central role in the design of the Delphos gown, whose creation Henriette Negrin confirmed as her own in a letter to Elsie McNeill Lee, at the time the exclusive distributor of the Fortuny fabrics and dresses in the United States.Fortuny company history In the letter, Henriette Negrin indicated her decision to terminate all production of the dress that she had designed. During the 47 years of her life with Mariano Fortuny, Henriette Negrin was fully involved in all aspects of their creative life. After his death, she curated her husband's art collection, donating works to several museums and compiling the inventory of the contents of their residence. She donated the building to the city of Venice, which came into its full possession after her death in 1965.

The Cabaret du Néant was an early pioneer of the modern theme restaurant and dealt with various aspects of mortality and death. The dark theme of the cabaret included magic tricks and illusions focusing on morbid subjects. The cabaret was first established in Brussels, subsequently moved to Paris, and promoted performances in New York City.Library Of Congress. The Journal, March 21, 1896. New York N.Y, 1895, Newspaper. Retrieved from the Library of Congress (Accessed December 03, 2017) The Cabaret du Néant, along with the Cabaret de L'Enfer (Cabaret of Hell), and the Cabaret du Ciel (Cabaret of Heaven), was part of a trio of themed restaurants established at around the same time in Montmartre.  History  Cabaret du Néant vault of the sad ghosts. The Cabaret du Néant was an early pioneer of the modern theme restaurant; its theme was death. The original theme restaurant, called at the time \\"Cabaret philosophique\\", was first established in Brussels in 1892, and soon after relocated to Boulevard Rochechouart in Paris under the name Cabaret de la Mort (The Cabaret of Death). In the 1890s, following the death of an area resident, the cabaret was renamed \\"Cabaret du Néant\\" because it was thought that \\"Néant\\" (nothingness) was less frightening to local residents. The cabaret was eventually moved to number 34, Boulevard de Clichy. At this address, the cabaret is listed under the category \\"Cabarets Artistiques\\" in the 1904 edition of Baedeker's Paris and Its Environs. In 1896 the cabaret sponsored performances in New York City, at the Casino Chambers, Thirty-ninth Street and Broadway.Murray Leeder, The Modern Supernatural and the Beginnings of Cinema, Springer, 2017,  Theme  The Salle d'Intoxication (Intoxication Hall) at the Cabaret du Néant featuring coffin- shaped tables, and chandeliers made of human bones Inside the cabaret, the patrons were led by a monk through a dark hall to the drinking area, where the waiters were dressed as undertakers. Presenters would then show paintings of people who would transform into skeletons. The monk also led the patrons into another room, where a member of the audience was invited to participate in a magic trick, by entering a coffin. The volunteer was subsequently wrapped in a white shroud, and apparently transformed into a skeleton, and then back into human form. Once inside the drinking area, the customers were told to take \\"bières\\", a word meaning both a beer and a coffin (\\"bier\\") in French. In the \\"Salle d'Intoxication\\" (Intoxication Hall), which featured chandeliers made of human bones, customers drank alcoholic beverages served in cups shaped like human skulls, while sitting at coffin-shaped tables. The decor of the cabaret was redolent with skeletons and corpses. Magic tricks were performed in which patrons appeared to dissolve into skeletons and ghosts would enter the rooms of the cabaret. It was a place that provided entertainment for the patrons, while at the same time, the mock-gothic theme could also cause worry and distress. The Cabaret du Néant is credited with producing \\"one of the most original adaptations\\" of Pepper's ghost. Scientific American called the New York performance of the Cabaret \\"[A] most interesting performance based upon the principles of the well known 'Pepper's ghost'\\". Illustrations by W. C.

Although this sequence was published for the first time in three parts in the modernist journal Rogue in May 1915, the Café du Néant section appeared alone in International: A Review of Two Worlds in August 1914 - making it Loy's first published poem. The later version, which is the version most commonly circulated today, refers to the distinctive atmosphere akin to that of the Cabaret du Néant which was a venue in Paris in the early twentieth century when Loy was living in the city. Relying upon macabre images in a gothic setting Loy describes two lovers, meeting in 'the fulsome ambiente' of the Café du Néant, amidst burning 'tapers' and 'coffin tables'. In reference to the setting, which in turn is used to metaphorically reflect upon the relationship, Loy notes it is a 'factitious chamber of DEATH'.  References   Further reading  * Albert A.

He primarily writes about people who struggle against their fate in Jangheung, a county situated off the southern coast of the Korean peninsula where Han himself was born. Han's work tends to have a strong sense of place; his stories are often set in his coastal hometown and contain the local dialect.  Life  Han Seung-won was born in Jangheung County, South Korea in 1939. He is a visiting professor of creative writing at Chosun University. He attended Jangheung Middle School, Jangheung High School, and Seorabeol Art University for creative writing. Han took a course taught by writer Kim Tong-ni and became acquainted with a number of classmates who went onto become writers, including Lee Mun Ku, Park Sang-ryoong, Cho Sehee, and Kim Won il. He made his literary debut in 1966 when he won the Shina Ilbo New Writer's Contest for his short story “Gajeungseureoun bada” (가증스런 바다 Despicable Sea). He began teaching at Jangdongseo Elementary School and has also taught at Kwangyang Middle School and Gwangju Dongshin Middle School. Han's short story “Mokseon” (목선 Wooden Boat) won a writing contest by Daehan Ilbo in 1968, boosting his literary career. In 1972, he founded Soseol Munhak (“fiction and literature”), an association of writers based in Gwangju, South Korea. Members included Mun Sun-tae, Kim Sin-un, Kang Sun-sik, and Lee Gye-hong. He relocated to Seoul in 1980 and wrote full-time, producing bestsellers such as Aje aje bara-aje (아제아제바라아제 Aje aje bara-aje). The novel was made into a movie. Over his 50-year career, he has persistently written stories inspired by the shores of his hometown. He moved back to Jangheung in 1997 and has resided there since. His two children, Han Kang and Han Dong-rim, are also writers. Both Han Seung-won and Han Kang have won the Yi Sang Literary Award and Kim Tong-ni Literary Award.  Writing  Han Seung-won's works usually involve characters who are driven mad by desire and struggle against their tragic fate. While these characters express a deep sentiment of han, they are not entirely helpless against fate. Some destroy themselves in a fit of insanity, while others commit sins to fulfill their desires. They become trapped in a vicious cycle of suffering, reinforcing the theme of fate in Han's works. One of Han's best- known works is the novella Hyebyeonui gilson (해변의 길손 Wanderer on the Shore), which is loosely based on an ancient Korean hero myth. The book spans decades from Japanese colonial rule through the chaotic post-liberation period to the Korean War, modernization, and finally the Gwangju Uprising in the 1980s. The turmoils of modern Korean history is reflected in the tragic life of the protagonist Hwang Du-pyo. In a storyline reminiscent of Cain and Abel, the novel centers around the conflict between Hwang and his little brother, who is smarter and more loved by their parents. Literary critic Wu Han-yong writes: “The tragedy of Hwang Du-pyo’s family originates from his inferiority complex and is correlated to Korean modern history; the tragedy of an individual expands into that of the nation. Another way to understand the novel is to focus on the psychology of its characters. In this kind of reading, one sees how Hwang’s bitter sense of inferiority grows as he experiences the tumults of history and how that compromises his integrity.”Han-yong Wu, “해설: 생명과 자유의지의 언어형상,” in 해변의 길손 외, Han Seung-won (Donga, 1995), 502. Often set in his coastal hometown of Jangheung County, Han's stories have a strong sense of place. The language, people, and environment of his hometown feature heavily in his works. Han has described the sea as “the womb of the universe” and the source of his creative inspiration.  Works  Fiction 1. 『앞산도 첩첩하고』, 창작과비평사, 1977. Deep is the Mountain Before Me.

Most major mosques in the country are Shia, however, the ruling family practices Sunni Islam. According to the Washington Institute, the views of Shia and Sunni leaders in Bahrain are similar to their Arab neighboring countries. Population Sunnis and Shias United for Bahrain Although more than half of Bahrain's population consists of Shia Muslims (estimated at over 60 percent), the Sunni royal family, Al Khalifa, governs the country. History The Sunni al-Khalifa family arrived in Shia Bahrain from Najd in 1783. Their rule has been oppressive and tyrannical for the native Shia majority, with Western support. The people of Bahrain celebrated the victory of the Shiite Iranian Revolution and formed gatherings to support it. In 1979, they wanted to participate in determining their own destiny through protests against the Al Khalifa government. Al Wefaq, as part of the Shia society in Bahrain, follows two goals: opposition to the current government in Bahrain and change the structure of society to based on rule of the people. Established in 2001, it was founded by more than 100 Shia scholars such as Ali Salman, Saeid Shahabi, Abdul Amir al-Jamri and Sheikh Isa Ahmed Qassim, leader of Al Wefaq. =February 14 Youth Coalition= According to behavior of Al-Khalifa's government Shia activists prompted on February 14, 2011. They named that day as the Day of Rage and asked the people to protest against al-Khalifa's behavior at that day. The Al-Khalifa came into contact with the protesters and from that day widespread wave of Al-Khalifa's actions against Shiites has been performed, including the detention of women and men and children and their torture, the destruction of Shia mosques and cemeteries. Society The majority of Sunni-Shia unity There are various sects in Bahrain, such as Baharna, Arab, Howala, Ajam, Asians. On the other hand, dominant political and official system in Bahrain are governed by Sunni people. According to the reports of The Guardian, when Āl Khalīfah family have begun to govern Bahrain, Shiites who have pieces of land, were changed to peasants. Now, High-ranking official positions belong to Sunnis and only few positions are ruled by Shiites. It is necessary to mention that in Bahrain the word of Sunni Muslim is not equal to reach people and shia means poor Bahrain people, but in the whole shia places in unsuitable economic situations. Shia scholars Bahrain has an ancient and historic background which arise from the presence of Shiite scholars. Some of them are listed as following: Maitham Al Bahrani, Kamal al- Deen Maitham bin Ali bin Maitham al-Bahrani, commonly known as Sheikh Maitham Al Bahrani was a leading 13th Century Twelver Eastern Arabian theologian, author and philosopher. Al Bahrani wrote on Twelver doctrine, affirmed free will, the infallibility of prophets and imams, the appointed imamate of \`Ali, and the occultation of the Twelfth Imam.Juan Cole, Sacred Space and Holy War, IB Tauris, 2007 p33 Yusuf al-Bahrani Yusuf ibn Ahmed al-Bahrani (1695–1772) (Arabic: يوسف البحراني) was a Bahraini theologian and a dominant person in the intellectual development of Twelver Shia Islam. Isa Qassim Ayatollah Sheikh Isa Ahmed Qassim (Arabic: آية الله الشيخ عيسى أحمد قاسم) is Bahrain's leading Shia cleric and a politician.

Lee, who began his literary career at the age of 25, spent most of his twenties in a hospital ward taking care of his mother who was fighting cancer. In his autobiographical short story “'” (오로라를 보라 Behold the Aurora), he writes that “obscene books and the smell of moldy blankets festered his heart at the age of twenty-seven” and that “the struggles of looking after a terminal cancer patient was less frustrating than having to write trapped in a ward.”Eung Jun Lee, “오로라를 보라” in 무정한 짐승의 연애 (Moonji, 2004). Apart from writing poetry and fiction, Lee wrote and directed Lemon Tree, a 40-minute film that screened at the New York Asian American International Film Festival and Paris International Short Film Festival. His novel Nae Yeonaeui modeun geot (내 연애의 모든 것 All About My Romance), which centers around an unlikely romance between two members of the South Korean National Assembly who belong to opposite sides of the political spectrum, has been adapted into a TV show.  Writing  In the preface to his novel ' (소년을 위한 사랑의 해석 An Interpretation of Love for Boys), Lee writes: “What is fiction? As literature is my religion, this question is a catechism to me. If someone asked me that same question, I’d answer: fiction is a story about people, and a story about people describes how they fall in and out of love. They love without knowing what love is and sometimes even burn life away because of it. But they grow as they embrace the chaos of love and sing. I like to think of all such people as ‘boys,’ and it is with this image of the boy in mind that I wrote the stories in this book.” The above quote suggests why some critics have associated Lee with aestheticism. His figurative use of the word “boy” to refer to any person in love is an example of his aesthetic portrayals of youth.  Works  Fiction 1. 『소년을 위한 사랑의 해석』, 문학과지성사, 2017.

His works are often based on real events. For example, his short story “Holidei” (홀리데이 Holiday) is a fictional retelling of the “Ji Kang Hun Incident,” a nationally broadcast hostage crisis in 1988 where four prison escapees held a family captive in Seoul. Ji Kang Hun, one of the escapees, became famous for shouting “Not guilty if you’re rich, guilty if you’re poor!” during the standoff with police and trying to commit suicide on camera as he listened to the song “Holiday” by Bee Gees. The short story begins with one of the policemen at the standoff marrying a hostage after the incident. “Baekjodeul noraehamyeo jukda” (백조들 노래하며 죽다 Swans Singing to Their Death) is based on a sex-tape scandal of a South Korean singer and “Urideul saibeo kideu” (우리들 사이버 키드 Us Cyber Kids) is about a man addicted to cyber sex.  Life  Lee Byeong-cheon was born in Wanju County, South Korea on February 11, 1956. He was raised in the city of Jeonju and attended Jeonju High School. He studied Korean literature at Chonbuk National University and received a master's degree in creative writing at Woosuk University. Lee was a member of Geulnae Literature Club at Jeonju High School alongside Ha Jae-bong and Kim Ik-du, who would later become a well-known poet and literary critic, respectively. He also ran away from home as a teenager and lived at the Buddhist temple Beomeosa for some time. Lee made his literary debut in 1981 when his poem “Uriui supe noin myeot gaeui deoche gwanhan hwagin” (우리의 숲에 놓인 몇 개의 덫에 관한 확인 A Confirmation on the Several Traps Laid in Our Forest) won the Chosun Ilbo New Writer's Contest in the poetry category. He was actively involved in literary societies that self-published magazines such as Siundong (“poetry movement”) and Namminsi (“Poetry of Southerners”). In 1982, “Deodeumiui hon” (더듬이의 혼 The Soul of an Antenna) received the Kyunghyang Daily News New Writer's Award, marking the beginning of his career as a fiction writer. He graduated Chonbuk National University in 1984 and joined Jeonju Munhwa Broadcasting Corp. as a producer. He was appointed the head of the news production department in January 2009, but resigned from his post in July that same year. He has taught creative writing at Jeonju University and Woosuk University, and led the Jeonbuk Writers’ association. In 2007, he organized a literary festival inviting 72 writers from 47 countries across Asia and Africa. He is the current chairman of Honbul Literature and has served as the director of the Jeonbuk Culture and Tourism Foundation since its establishment in 2016.  Writing  Lee Byeong-cheon's first short story collection Sanyang (사냥 The Hunt) came out ten years after his debut. The collection was noted for its compelling rhetorical style, with critics referring to Lee as a “literary stylist” and “homo rhetoricus.” His second short story collection Holidei (홀리데이 Holiday), published a decade later, is a fictional account of real incidents or historical events. Lee's 2016 novel Bukjjok Nyeoja (북쪽 녀자 Woman from the North) is a story of love and separation between a North Korean woman (Lim Chae-ha) and South Korean man (Baek San- seo). Lim is a tour guide working at Mount Kumgang from the North Korean side, while Baek is a guide from the South Korean side. The two meet on July 3, 2008 and have a passionate romance over the next forty days. They are forced to separate when all tours from the South are suspended due to the death of a South Korean tourist who was shot dead for wandering into a North Korean military area, which is a real-life incident that occurred on July 11, 2008. The lovers long after each other for three years until they decide to seek each other out. But in a cruel twist of fate, Lim defects to South Korea while Baek crosses over to the North. The novel ends with Baek being shot while crossing the Tumen River and Lim mourning over his dead body.  Works  Short Story Collections 1. 『홀리데이』, 문학동네, 2001년, Holiday.

His breakthrough work is Modu areumdaun aideul (모두 아름다운 아이들 All Beautiful Children), a Bildungsroman written in the form of diary entries portraying the confusion and anguish of youths in South Korea’s rigid education system.  Life  Choi Si-han was born in Boryeong, South Korea in 1952. Keenly interested in literature as a high school student, he was the president of his school’s literature club and aspired to study Korean literature in university. He enrolled in the Korean literature program at Sogang University, where he found his passion in theatre and actively took part in student productions as an actor and director. Due to financial need, however, he began pursuing a career in teaching. He submitted his manuscripts to writing contests in the meantime but found little success. It is during this period that he earned his master’s and doctoral degrees in Korean literature at Sogang University. In 1982, he finally made his literary debut with his short story “Naktaui gyeoul” (낙타의 겨울 The Camel’s Winter). Caught between teaching and writing, he focused his energies on the former, as he confessed in one interview. His achievements as a literary educator tends to be more recognized than his achievements as a writer. He teaches Korean language and literature at Sookmyung Women’s University and was also head of the storytelling department for interdisciplinary majors.  Writing  Choi Si-han penned two short story collections to date. He is best known for his coming-of-age book Modu areumdaun aideul (모두 아름다운 아이들 All Beautiful Children). In diary format, the book portrays the internal turmoil of youths struggling in South Korea’s education system. The book has sold steadily since it was printed in 1996 and is already on its 25th print run totaling over 50,000 copies, according to the publisher. One of the stories in the collection, “Heosaengjeoneul baeuneun sigan” (「허생전」을 배우는 시간 Learning the Story of Master Heo in Class), has been included in Korean literature textbooks for high school students. Set in the early 1990s when teacher unions were illegal in South Korea, the story sheds light on the issues of Korean education and suggests the need for students to critically assess literary texts.

NASA research agreements (NRA) are granted to develop electric-propulsion components. They will be completed in 2019 and the internal NASA work by 2020, then they will be assembled in a megawatt-scale drive system to be tested in the narrowbody-sized NEAT.  Machines  The University of Illinois is developing a 1-megawatt permanent magnet synchronous motor spinning at 18,000 rpm to drive a Rolls-Royce LibertyWorks' Electrically Variable Engine turbofan from a battery for taxiing, takeoff and idle descent in a parallel hybrid. Ohio State University is building 300-kW and 1-megawatt prototype motors, a 2,700 rpm, 1-m (3.3-ft) diameter, 2.7-megawatt liquid cooled ring induction motor and designed a 5,000 rpm, 10-megawatt turbofan integrated ring motor. These electric machines target 13 kW/kg and over 93% efficiency, while NASA Glenn Research Center is developing a superconducting electric machine with a 16 kW/kg goal and above 98% efficiency: a 0.4-m-dia, 6,800 rpm, 1.4-megawatt wound-field synchronous motor using a self-cooled, high-temperature superconducting rotor winding.  Voltage  The highest voltage used now is 540 (±270) volts, but distributing megawatt-scale power will require higher voltage to reduce current for smaller, lighter electric cables. One megawatt over need 900 kg at 540 V but would be reduced to 200 kg at 2,000 V DC. A near-term hybrid would need 1,000–3,000-volt and a fully turboelectric large aircraft 5,000–10,000-volt, like ship power systems but arcing occurs at much lower voltages at low pressures than at sea level.  Inverters  While a battery power source would use a direct current distribution, a gas turbine power source would also allow alternating current which would need power converters, mainly inverters to convert DC to controlled, variable-frequency AC to regulate a motor speed and torque. Silicon carbide [SiC] and gallium nitride [GaN] switches can operate at higher frequencies with lower losses, increasing efficiency. GE is building a 2,400-volt DC, 1-megawatt inverter with SiC switches and its 1.7-kW MOSFETs power modules. The University of Illinois is building a 1,000 volts DC, 200-kW \\"flying capacitor\\" scalable to a 1-megawatt with GaN-based field- effect transistor switches. Both are liquid cooled and target 19 kW/kg at 99% efficiency but Boeing is developing a cryogenically cooled 1-megawatt inverter for 26 kW/kg and 99.3% efficiency with off-the-shelf silicon semiconductors, and is currently fabricating a liquid-nitrogen-cooled 200-kW inverter before a 1-megawatt one.

Quantum crystallography involves both experimental and computational work. The theoretical part of quantum crystallography is based on quantum mechanical calculations of atomic/molecular/crystal wave functions, density matrices or density models, used to simulate the electronic structure of a crystalline material. Experimental works mainly rely on scattering techniques (X-rays, neutrons, γ-Rays, electrons), although spectroscopy as well as atomic microscopy are also sources of information. The connection between crystallography and quantum chemistry has always been very tight, after X-ray diffraction techniques became available in crystallography. In fact, the scattering of radiation enables mapping the one-electron distribution or the elements of a density matrix. The kind of radiation and scattering determines the quantity which is represented (electron charge or spin) and the space in which it is represented (position or momentum space). Although the wave function is typically assumed not to be directly measurable, recent advances enable also to compute wave functions that are restrained to some experimentally measurable observable (like the scattering of a radiation). The term Quantum Crystallography was first introduced in revisitation articles by L. Huang, L. Massa and Nobel Prize winner Jerome Karle, who associated it with two mainstreams: a) crystallographic information that enhances quantum mechanical calculations and b) quantum mechanical approaches to improve crystallography information. This definition mainly refers to studies started in the 1960s and 1970s, when first attempts to obtain wave functions from scattering experiments appeared. This field has been recently reviewed, within the context of this definition. Parallel to studies on wave function determination, R. F. Stewart and P. Coppens investigated the possibilities to compute models for one-electron charge density from X-ray scattering (for example by means of pseudoatoms multipolar expansion), and later of spin density from polarized neutron diffraction, that originated the scientific community of charge, spin and momentum density. In a recent review article, V. Tsirelson gave a more general definition: \\"Quantum crystallography is a research area exploiting the fact that parameters of quantum-mechanically valid electronic model of a crystal can be derived from the accurately measured set of X-ray coherent diffraction structure factors\\". The book Modern Charge Density Analysis offers a survey of the research involving Quantum Crystallography and of the most adopted experimental or theoretical methodologies. The International Union of Crystallography has recently established a commission on Quantum Crystallography, as extension of the previous commission on Charge, Spin and Momentum density, with the purpose of coordinating research activities in this field.

It is endemic to southeastern United States. Description The Dixie chub is similar in shape to the creek chub, (Semotilus atromaculatus) although it is typically a more robust and shorter than the creek chub. It also has larger and fewer lateral line scales, the origin of the dorsal fin is to the rear of that of the pelvic fin whereas in S. atromaculatus it sits directly over the pelvic fin origin, and the spots on the dorsal fin and caudal fin are less distinct. In the breeding season the males develop four large, hooked tubercles on either side of the head, with those nearest the nares frequently becoming fused. They are generally dark on the back, with the underside being colored from orange to pink on the underside while its fins are yellow-orange. Compared to S. atromaculatus the Dixie chub has a smaller number of head tubercles on its gill covers and caudal fin. The spot on the caudal peduncle is more diffuse than in S. atromaculatus which is normally wedge-shaped and distinct from the lateral stripe, while the equivalent spot in S. atromaculatus is quadrilateral and is joined to the lateral stripe. The lateral strip is dark and rather wide but not very distinct. It grows to a length of . Distribution The Dixie chub is endemic to rivers that flow into the Gulf of Mexico in the south-eastern United States from the Tombigbee River in Alabama to the Ochlockonee River drainage in Georgia and Florida. It has also been recorded from three tributaries of Bear Creek in Colbert County, Alabama, the first records from the drainage of the Tennessee River. The Dixie chub is sympatric with S. atromaculatus in the rivers draining into Mobile Bay where it is found in the coastal reaches up to the Fall Line but replaces it eastwards from the Conecuh River. Habitat and ecology The Dixie chub is found in small, clear headwater streams in the pools of creeks and small rivers with sand or gravel substrates. The fish aggregate to spawn in April. As in S. atromaculatus and S. lumbee this species creates breeding structures known as pit/ridge nests. These are constructed in the flowing stretches near pools which have a suitable refuge for the male to escape to, e.g. an undercut bank. The nests starts out as a pit excavated by a dominant male, the male mates with a female and then begins to cover the eggs with small pebbles taken from the substrate starting from the upstream end of the pit. Subsequent matings lead to the eggs being laid down stream of each previous batch of eggs and these are in turn covered by more pebbles and a new pit is excavated downstream, lengthening the ridge. The males guard the nests and display at other similar sized males, by swimming parallel to them. It will also aggessivley lunge at other species which approach the nest. The saffron shiner (Notropis rubricroceus) has been recorded associating with nesting Dixie chubs. The Dixie chub is omnivorous and has been recorded eating variety of animal and plant material, including insects, worms, fishes, mollusks, crayfishes, and plant material. Naming The Dixie chub was described by the American ichthyologist David Starr Jordan in 1877. The generic name Semotilus means \\"spotted banner\\" and refers to the dorsal fin while the specific name thoreauianus was given to honor of Henry David Thoreau.

Observational history  NGC 6810 was discovered by John Herschel on July 10, 1834. It was later added to the New General Catalogue by John Louis Emil Dreyer. = Misclassification of NGC 6810 = This galaxy used to be classified as a Seyfert 2 galaxy, but that is probably incorrect. Recent X-ray observations provide no evidence of any active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and high resolution optical spectra do not confirm the status of NGC 6810 as a Seyfert galaxy, thus it appears to have been misclassified. Features NGC 6810 is an early-type spiral of roughly equivalent mass to the Milky Way. X-ray, optical, IR and radio properties of NGC 6810 are all consistent with a starburst galaxy. =Galactic-scale superwind= Observation of NGC 6810 with XMM-Newton reveals the presence of extended soft X-ray emission within the optical disc of the galaxy (which is closely associated with star-forming regions) and also beyond the optical disc. This, along with Hα filamentation and peculiar minor axis ionized gas kinematics, strongly suggest that NGC 6810 is host to a galactic- scale superwind which is streaming from the starburst region. The actively star-forming regions and the base radius of the outflow are unusually spread out, and extend out to a radius of ∼6.5 kpc from the nucleus. Most superwinds in other galaxies appear to arise in ≲ 1 kpc-scale nuclear starburst regions. That makes NGC 6810 one of the few ‘disc-wide’ superwinds currently known, because NGC 6810's superwind base extends across nearly 70 percent of the entire galaxy's diameter. Only three other starburst galaxies are known to have broad superwind sources.

In the animations he is portrayed as brown or grey, but in the colour pictures made by Tove Jansson he is always white (although sometimes, when feeling ill, he turns slightly green). He has a long thin tail and his head looks much like a kangaroo's, with a long pointed muzzle with a black nose at the tip and large triangular ears that splay out from the top of his head. In the books Sniff often spends the night in the Moominhouse, but he lives in a dwelling built into a rock outcrop near the forest.

He was a brother of the clergyman and writer Charles Kingsley. Early life and career Kingsley was the fourth of five children of the Reverend Charles Kingsley and his wife Mary; he was born at Barnack, Northamptonshire on 14 February 1826. Charles Kingsley and the novelist Henry Kingsley were his brothers, and the writer Charlotte Chanter was his sister. He was educated at King's College School, London, at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. in 1846, and in Paris, where he was slightly wounded during the barricades of 1848. Later in 1848 his activity in combating the outbreak of cholera in England was commemorated by his brother Charles in the portrait of Tom Thurnall in Two Years Ago. Kingsley completed his medical education in Heidelberg, and returned to England about 1850. He became the private physician to a succession of aristocratic patients; he adopted foreign travel as his method of treatment, and either in the capacity of medical adviser, or merely as travelling companion, he explored many countries of the world. While acting as medical adviser to the Earl of Ellesmere's family, he had the partial care of the library at Bridgewater House, Westminster; he compiled a catalogue of Elizabethan dramas held there, and in 1865 he edited, from a manuscript preserved in the library, Francis Thynne's Animadversions uppon the Annotacions and Corrections of some Imperfections of Impressiones of Chaucer's Workes … reprinted in 1598. Travels In 1866 Kingsley accompanied Baroness Herbert of Lea and her children on a tour of Spain.

He learned how to play shogi at school with friends, and entered the Japan Shogi Association's apprentice school at the rank of 6-kyū as a student of shogi professional Kazuharu Shoshi in 2001. Early on, Ishida remained in at home in Nayoro, living with his mother and commuting twice monthly to Tokyo by plane to participate in the apprentice school. He would attend junior high school during the week, leave school early the day before his schedule games, and fly to Tokyo where he was met by his father. who was stationed in Tokyo as a member of the Japanese Self Defense Forces. After Ishida finished his games, his father would take him to the airport for the return trip back to Hokkaido. At first, Ishida found the apprentice school quite difficult and actually was demoted from 6-kyū to 7-kyū because of poor results; eventually, however, he started to perform better and obtained promotion to 5-kyū. After graduating from junior high school, he and his mother moved from Hokkaido to Tokyo and he enrolled in a local senior high school; he continued to perform well as an apprentice professional and was promoted to the rank of 2-dan by the time he was a third-year high school student. After graduating from senior high school, Ishida decided to continue his education at university to not only please his mother, who felt that further education would help his job prospects if he did not become a professional shogi player, but also because he was really interested in mathematics. He passed the entrance exam for the Department of Mathematics for the Faculty of Science and Engineering of Chuo University and began living on his own after his mother moved back to Nayoro.

Synopsis In 1947 a UFO was shot down in Roswell. Since then the US army have been training commandos called the Exterminators to defend earth in the event of an alien invasion, however after almost 70 years with no Alien events the Exterminators are retired. But suddenly the aliens, originating from Alpha Draconis, return positioning spaceships above major cities around the world including Badaling, London, Paris, Manhattan and Roswell, New Mexico. An alien lands in Roswell, a drunk man spots him, and the alien decapitates him with a single shot from a gun on its arm. The USAF send fighter jets to attack the motherships, but their missiles have no effect, and the jets are destroyed by alien fighter ships. In Colorado Patrick, an ex-member of the Exterminators, and his wife are attacked by the aliens. The aliens are after a small chip that Patrick has. He manages to kill one of the aliens but a spaceship blows up his house killing his wife. Patrick decides to get the Exterminators team back together. He finds George, another ex-member of the Exterminators. George claims to have been abducted by the aliens, which seems to have driven him mad. They find James another ex- member of the Exterminators in Albuquerque, New Mexico. James has stashed guns for them to use. They then go to Ruidoso, New Mexico to recruit David back into the Exterminators. Back in Roswell troops are deployed to the ground. A squad of navy seals find an alien, who they shoot at but it is protected by an energy shield. It then shoots back and kills them all. The Exterminators arrive in Colorado to find Linda, who they also recruit back into the team. The alien spaceships start firing at the major cities, destroying Moscow and Paris. The Exterminators arrive at their old training ground in Area 51, and find Burkis who was their manager. Burkis reluctantly reinstates them and they are deployed to Roswell. They are instructed to capture an alien. As they get close to the alien George seems to be affected by its presence, due to alien implants that were put in his brain when he was abducted. They kill the alien with a high-ech explosive. They find the aliens have tapped into the fiber- optic internet network, to intercept and disrupt military communications. They take the alien body back to Area 51 for examination. Burkis shows the Exterminators the UFO from 1947 which has been kept in Area 51. The aliens continue to attack major cities destroying Washington DC. A spaceship attacks Area 51, the Exterminators pilot fighter jets to attack the alien fighter ships. However their missiles are ineffective as the fighters are protected with energy shields. They manage to destroy the fighter ships by making them fly into each other. Patrick’s jet is damaged so he ejects himself and lands safely. An alien ship lands outside Area 51. The Exterminators prepare for an attack, using the arm cannon from the Aliens body against the invading aliens. They manage to stop the aliens initial attack. James is stabbed by an Alien, but he takes a serum which allows him to survive the pain and gives him super- human endurance. He attacks the alien beating it to death. The Exterminators theorize, that destroying the mother ship will break the aliens neutral network neutralizing them all. They have to get inside the mother ship and detonate a bomb to destroy it. They use the old 1947 UFO, to fly to the mother ship, with Linda and James staying behind to protect Area 51. The serum starts to take over James’s body, turning him into one of the aliens. He kills the remaining aliens and then turns on Linda, so Linda has to kill him. George lands the UFO inside the mother ship, which bypasses the shields as the aliens think it is their own ship. Patrick, George and David go into the ship to plant the bomb. David stays behind to protect the bomb, as George and Patrick escape in the UFO. The bomb explodes destroying the mother ship and the Aliens neural network. All the remaining alien ships lose power and crash land on the Earth.

As two-year-old in 2002 she ran seven times in just over three months, winning the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes in Ireland as well as finishing second in the Prestige Stakes. In the following year she failed to win in three starts but was placed third in the Coronation Stakes. As a broodmare she produced five winners before dying in 2015 at the age of fifteen. Background Mail The Desert was a bay mare bred in Ireland by Sean Coughlan. As a yearling in October 2001 she was consigned to the Goffs sale and was bought for 54,000 Irish guineas by the bloodstock agents Bloodhorse International. She entered the ownership of the \\"property entrepreneur\\" John Livock and was sent into training with Mick Channon at West Ilsley. She was ridden in all but one of her races by Steve Drowne. Her sire Desert Prince was the top-rated European three-year-old colt of 1998 when he won the Irish 2000 Guineas, Prix du Moulin and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He had some success as a breeding stallion, with his other offspring including My Tent Or Yours, Outback Prince (The T J Smith), Oriental Magic (Scottish Derby), Mourilyan (March Stakes), France (Tetrarch Stakes) and Tarzi (Hyperion Stakes). Mail The Desert's dam Mail Boat was unraced but came from a very good family. She was descended from the influential broodmare Felucca, who was the ancestor of numerous major winners Cut Above, Sharp Edge, Longboat, Bireme, Indigenous and Fenomeno. Racing career =2002: two-year-old season= Mail The Desert made her racecourse debut in a minor race over six furlongs on good to soft ground at Windsor Racecourse on 25 May. Starting at odds of 100/30 in a ten-runner field she took the lead a furlong out and won by two lengths from New Foundation. The filly was then stepped up in class for the Listed Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot on 22 June in which she finished fourth of the nineteen runners behind the David Elsworth-trained Duty Paid. Three weeks later she was sent to France for the Listed Prix Roland de Chambure over 1400 metres on very soft ground at Deauville and came home fourth behind Six Perfections. In the Star Stakes at Sandown Park two weeks later she ran third to Sister Bluebird, beaten just over half a length by the winner. The filly's busy schedule continued as she contested the Sweet Solera Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 10 August but ran poorly and finished seventh of the eight runners in a race won by Soviet Song. Mail The Desert was back on the track two weeks later for the Prestige Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and produced an improved effort as she took second place, beaten one and a half lengths by the Barry Hills-trained favourite Geminiani. On 1 September Mail The Desert ran for the seventh time when she was sent to Ireland to contest the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh and stated at odds of 8/1 in a nine-runner field. The Lowther Stakes runner-up Danaskaya started favourite, while the other fancied runners included Pearl Dance, Szabo and Luminata (Silver Flash Stakes). Mail The Desert disputed the lead with Pearl Dance before establishing a narrow advantage a furlong out and stayed on well under pressure to win by a head from Luminata to give Steve Drowne his first win in Ireland. Pearl Dance and Danaskaya were a neck and half a length away in third and fourth. MickChannon said \\"I'm delighted... We keep turning up for these good races and all I said to the owner was that wherever Pearl Dance finished we'd be either half a length in front of her or half a length behind her... as well as having a fair bit of ability, Mail The Desert is tough and takes her races well.\\" Mail The Desert did not race again in 2002, missing intended targets in the Fillies' Mile and the Prix Marcel Boussac. =2003: three-year- old season= Before the start of her second season, Mail The Desert was acquired by the Hertfordshire-based Newsells Park Stud. The filly began her second campaign when she returned from an absence of over nine months to contest the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 20 June. Starting a 14/1 outsider she led for most of the way before being overtaken in the straight and finishing third behind Russian Rhythm and Soviet Song. In the following month Mail The Desert was sent to Germany for the Group 2 Grosser Porsche Preis over 1600 metres at Hoppegarten. She finished second to the locally trained colt Martillo after repeating the front-running tactics employed at Ascot. The filly was then dropped back in trip for the Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville on 10 August. Ridden by Thierry Thulliez she never looked likely to win and came home tenth of the eleven finishers behind Porlezza. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Mail The Desert was retired to become a broodmare for the Newsells Park Stud. She produced ten foals and five winners between 2005 and 2015: *Crimson Dawn, a bay filly, foaled in 2005, sired by Fasliyev. Failed to win in two races. *Postman, bay colt (later gelded), 2006, by Dr Fong. Won five races. *Al Muthanaa, chestnut colt (gelded), 2007, by Pivotal.

The son of Prohibitionist mayor and presidential candidate Neal Dow, Fred Dow served in a number of political positions during his lifetime, including in the Maine House of Representatives and as Collector of the Port of Portland. During his time in the House, he served as Speaker from 1889-1890. He helped found the Portland Club, an influential Republican all-male social club in Portland's West End. He also owned and served as editor of one of Portland's largest newspapers, the Evening Express, from 1887-1925. Early life Frederick Dow was born to father Neal Dow and Maria Cornelia Durant (Maynard) Dow in Portland, Maine on December 23, 1840. His ancestors on his father side dated back to the early British colonists. His mother was of Huguenot descent. He attended Portland Academy, Portland High School, and the Friends' School in Providence, Rhode Island. He left school at the age of 16 and entered the tanning business with his father. Dow volunteered to serve in the Maine militia at the outbreak of the Civil War, but was blocked by his politically powerful father from fighting. In October, 1864, he married Julia Dana. Politics In 1871, Dow began his political career with an appointment to the staff of Republican governor Sidney Perham. From 1872-1874, he served as first a member and then chair of the Executive Council of Maine. For the 1874 election, he was unanimously nominated by the Cumberland, County Republicans for Maine Senate. However, he did not win a seat in that year's general election. Following the entire Republican ticket's defeat in 1875, Dow was elected to the Maine Republican Party's State Committee for Cumberland County. He was also appointed by governor Nelson Dingley Jr. as one of the Commissioners from Maine to the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia. He served as a delegate at large to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1880 which nominated James Garfield and Chester Arthur as its ticket. Prior to the 1882 general election, Dow was elected as the successor to U.S. Senator James G. Blaine as chair of the Maine Republican State Committee. Following that election, one in which Republican nominee Frederick Robie took back the Governorship for his party, Dow's stature was raised within the party. As a result, Dow was appointed by now President Arthur to replace the recently deceased Lot M. Morrill as Collector of the Port of Portland, a highly prestigious and lucrative position. Following the defeat of the Republicans nationally in 1884, new President Grover Cleveland appointed a Democrat to the Collector position in 1885. Dow then turned his attention to building the Republican Party nationally through the creation of permanent social clubs. These included the Portland Club, which was only the second such club in the country. He was also the first President of the Maine State League of Republican Clubs. In 1886, Dow was nominated by the Republicans for a seat in the Maine House of Representatives, which he easily won. He was re-elected two years later. In 1889, he was elected Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives. Upon the election of Republican Benjamin Harrison to the presidency in 1888, Dow declined the post of Collector until his term as Speaker ended. Following the September 1890 general election, Dow was re-appointed to the Collector position by Harrison.

The name Dorchester was chosen to honour the 1st Baron Dorchester —Sir Guy Carleton—who served as Governor of the Province of Quebec from 1768 to 1778, and Governor General of British North America from 1785 to 1795. The choice of \\"a bewigged British soldier, an ... unapologetic colonial governor from the pre-democratic era\\" is intended to underscore the magazine's belief that \\"history consists of more than a parade of secular modern progressives.\\" Founder Founding editor C.P. Champion holds a Fellowship at Queen's University's Centre for International and Defence Policy. He is the author of The Strange Demise of British Canada, published in 2010 by McGill-Queen's University Press. He served as Director of Citizenship Policy in the office of Jason Kenney , where he oversaw production of the acclaimed 2009 Discover Canada citizenship test study guide, still in use today and described by the Globe and Mail as \\"a rare and significant attempt to reshape the national image.\\" He worked at Ted Byfield's Alberta Report from 1994 to 1997 as a news reporter and typesetter. His most recent book, Relentless Struggle: Saving the Army Reserve 1995-2019 (Durnovaria, 2019), with a Foreword by the former Commander of the Canadian Army, LGen Paul Wynnyk, explored how a series of Canadian defence ministers have failed to adequately support the army reserve since the early 1990s, following defence budget cuts under then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, which, according to J.L. Granatstein severely strained both the Reserve's personnel and equipment. Champion himself joined the army reserve as a Private and underwent basic training at the age of 46. Controversies According to news reports, a 2019 Dorchester Review article by Champion entitled \\"Alberta’s Little History War,” said that in Alberta classrooms, there was an \\"ongoing fad is that we need 'more' First Nations 'perspectives.'\\". He said he got a \\"repetitive\\" dose of \\"oolichan, cedar masks, and Trickster stories\\" in his own elementary school experience during the 1970s. He criticized as \\"deplorable agitprop\\" the classroom activity to teach from an alleged Indigenous perspective —the KAIROS Blanket exercise—\\"brainwashes children into thinking of themselves as ‘settlers’ stealing the land — the kind of 'truth and reconciliation' that is not evidence-based but relies on 'knowledge keepers’ to 'foster truth.'\\" The blanket exercise has been widely used in Canada in response to the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) call for inclusion of indigenous history in school curriculum as essential for improved relationships with non- indigenous people. Champion was on this basis denounced as \\"racist\\" on Twitter and by the Alberta NDP. The TRC gathered approximately 7,000 testimonies from the survivors of residential schools over a six-year period—from 2008 to 2014, according to Justice Murray Sinclair. Themes =The history wars= According to a 2013 Toronto Review of Books article, \\"The History Wars in Canada\\", in 1998, then-York University history professor, Jack Granatstein \\"fired the opening shot of the History Wars\\"—a \\"fierce conflict about the meaning and purpose\\" of Canadian history. In his 1998 book, Who Killed Canadian History?, Jack Granatstein said that, since the late 1960s, a new generation of social historians in history departments have waged an ideological war with historians like himself, who defend the traditional narrative history, with a focus on chronology, and elite figures in political and military history. He said that in the writing and teaching of history in Canada, the teaching of \\"hard facts\\", has been replaced by distorted interpretations of the past that focus on \\"victimization and blame seeking\\". Among the reasons for these changes in historiography he included multiculturalism and the whole child approach to learning. In a 2013 article, Mark Sholdice argued that Champion was one the \\"right-wing activists and scholars\\" leading the history wars in Canada, and moreover that he was \\"probably the most important Conservative historian in Canada\\" at that time. Champion's 2010 book, The Strange Demise of British Canada: The Liberals and Canadian Nationalism, 1964-1968, written as his doctoral thesis, Nova Britannia Revisited, between 2004 and 2007, anticipated the Harper administration's views on the writing and teaching of Canadian history. Sholdice added that in 2011, the history wars became a \\"tangible reality,\\" with the Harper government favouring subjects such as the \\"military and the monarchy\\" for \\"historical attention\\", and \\"spending lavishly\\" on the \\"commemoration of the War of 1812.\\" Media National Post columnist Barbara Kay described the Dorchester Review as \\"politically incorrect and iconoclastic\\" writing which resists \\"the prevailing progressivist view that historians must choose between a right and wrong side of history,\\" without catering to a specific ideology. In the same article (2016), Kay reported that the Review's core readership consisted of 500 readers—50% professionals and business people, 10% academics, 15-20% politicians, and 20-25% eclectic readers. Jonathan Kay has described it as \\"the only high-level publication in Canada that examines our history and traditions without even a passing nod to academic fashions and identity politics.\\" Former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper was observed reading the magazine in Canada's House of Commons, contributing to its image as a right-wing publication. Writing in the Literary Review of Canada, Prof. Jerry White cited The Dorchester Review among works that \\"might...prompt readers to rethink the way in which not all liberals are Liberals and not all conservatives sound like the Conservatives.\\" The Review has been attacked by members of the alt-right for being insufficiently alarmed by large-scale immigration. Ricardo Duchesne faulted Australian contributor Gregory Melleuish as an example of how \\"Conservatives self-deceive themselves into believing what they dislike because they are afraid of leftist repercussions.\\" The Review also published in its second issue an article highly critical of the treatment of Canadian Japanese during the Second World War. In 2017 Champion criticized right-wing counter-protestors for co-opting the Canadian Red Ensign, saying he was \\"disappointed when the self-described traditionalists of the Proud Boys were captured on video provoking Indigenous protesters with the flag.\\" See also * Conservatism in Canada * List of Canadian magazines * List of literary magazines * Tory * Traditionalist conservatism References External links * Notable contributors * George Jonas (1925-2016) * Kevin Myers (Ireland) * Gregory Melleuish (Australia) * Barbara Kay * Ken Coates (historian) * Andrew Roberts (historian) * Conrad Black * Patrice Dutil * Patricia Phenix * Michel Bock * Charles-Philippe Courtois * David Twiston Davies (1945-2020) * John Howard (Australia) * Narindar Saroop (United Kingdom) * Robin Sears * Alastair Sweeny * Roger Noriega * Gil Troy * Paul Hollander (1932-2019) * Richard Lebrun * Frédéric Bastien * David Frum * Serge Joyal [Canadian Senator - (L.)] * John O’Sullivan (columnist) * Hugh Bicheno * Julian Thompson * Barry Gough * J.L.

Personal life Tom Reid was born on 3 March 1926 in Limerick, Ireland. His father, Joe Reid had also played rugby for Garryowen and his cousin was the Irish international Paddy Reid. Reid attended the Christian Boys' College in Limerick. As well as playing rugby, Reid also rowed for Limerick Boat Club. Rugby career Reid first appearance for the Garryowen club came in the 1947-48 season. With Garryowen, he won the Munster Senior Cup on three occasions, including 1954 when he was the club captain. He played for the Munster representative team in matches against international opposition; against Australia in 1947, South Africa in 1951 and New Zealand in 1954. He later played for London Irish. His first appearance for Ireland was in the 1953 Five Nations Championship, against England. In January 1954 against New Zealand, he moved from his usual position at lock to play at Number 8. He returned to lock for subsequent appearances in the 1954 and 1955 Five Nations Championship matches. Reid was included in the squad for the British Lions tour to South Africa in 1955. During the tour, Reid played in ten tour games against local opposition and two out of the four test matches against the South Africa national team; the second test where he played at Number 8 position and the third test where he reverted to his usual position at lock. In December 1955, Reid played at Flanker in a combined Scotland & Ireland team that played a combined England & Wales team at Lansdowne Road to mark the opening of the West Upper Stand at the venue. Further appearances for Ireland followed in the 1956 Five Nations and the 1957 Five Nations, the only edition of the championship where Reid played in all four of Ireland's games. His 13th and final game for Ireland came in that championship, against Wales. Reid also played 14 games for the Barbarians invitational team, including six games on the team's first overseas tour to Canada in 1957. Reid decided to emigrate to Canada following the tour. In 1959 Reid played for the Eastern Canada team in their match against the British Lions. As of 2017, he is one of only two players to have played both for and against the Lions.

During his escape, he drove a car directly up to the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) dividing North and South Korea and crashed, apparently losing a wheel. He then exited the car and sprinted across the MDL under close-range gunfire, collapsing on the South Korean side under cover of a low wall, meters away from the MDL. After being rescued by South Korean soldiers, Oh was transported in a helicopter from the U.S. Eighth Army's 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade, to the Ajou University Hospital in Suwon. Having lost half of his blood from five gunshot wounds received from North Korean soldiers during his escape, his condition required an immediate operation upon arrival at the hospital to save his life. North Korean soldiers violated the Korean Armistice Agreement during the incident by firing shots across the MDL into South Korea.

Höch grew up in Ludwigshafen, then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. In 1864, at the age of 19, Höch began his first venture which was to export Palatine tobacco to the Union during the American Civil War. When the war ended, Höch filed for bankruptcy. He continued to trade goods and acted as a broker. Höch entered the rail industry in the 1860s as a co-accordant in the construction of the Munich–Rosenheim railway line. Höch's businesses were successful in this era. In 1866, he moved to Munich where he dedicated himself to general trade and finance, from suspenders and walking sticks to investments in real estate business. Early Life Höch grew up in Ludwigshafen, then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. His father, Gottfried Höch, was the éminence grise in the founding of the community of Ludwigshafen and the economist show managed the estates of Stéphanie de Beauharnais. Business Career = Maxvorstadt= Höch's understood the needs of urban housing and he partly managed to maintain such projects until they broke even. As a land owner, Höch could not compete with the Munich breweries' and the Catholic Church's monopoly. Höch was good with people and was able to convince investors to fund his projects. Because during the late 1880s nearby Schwabing had electric street lights and had rapid population and economic growth, it was common to sell residences in Maxvorstadt as quasi-Schwabing. Over the years, Höch built entire streets. He was particularly involved in the emergence of the artists' quarter in Maxvorstadt (new Schwabing) and large sections to the west located between the streets of Schwabingerlandstraße (today's Leopoldstraße) and Schleißheimer Straße. Höch donated a space at the center of the area for the construction of the new , built by between 1894 and 1897. After the Panic of 1873, Höch started his first big venture. He built buildings along all of the and lived at number 46. A neighboring house collapsed and caused the entire area to be discredited for five to six years as a neighborhood of dodgy buildings. At the foreclosure sale of about 40 properties, Höch's debts amounted to more than one million. He went bankrupt for the second time.On Hans Beilhack dedicated an article to Höch in the Münchner Zeitung with the Headline: The man who changed the face of Munich. On 22 May 1938 Adolf Hitler did the first cut of the spade for a tunnel that forty years later became the Goetheplatz (Munich U-Bahn) as the first step of the Gesamtbauplan für die Hauptstadt der Bewegung. Beilhack, already banned from writing, showed the narrow degree between visionary investor and impostor. =Dairy farm= In 1875, Höch opened a dairy farm in the Heßstraße, which was still undeveloped at the time and bought the first four of twenty cows. At the dairy, he also produced child milk (pasteurized milk), a novelty found by Franz von Soxhlet. In 1877, Höch acquired citizenship and the right to live in Munich for DM 171 (marks), the German currency used at that time, which equals around $2,000 USD today. =Volksgarten Nymphenburg= In 1890, he founded and financed the with . =Project Tuberculosis spa cure= Although he was dodging creditors in 1891, he sought to open a spa to cure tuberculosis. Höch pursued this plan by acquiring the Palais Gumpenberg on Ottostraße 6. According to his will, he wanted to offer a spa cure for pulmonary patients using the healing serum developed by Robert Koch. His idea failed because residents resisted and in 1892 the Palais Bumpenberg became the Hotel Continental, where Rainer Maria Rilke later would stay. =Project Septic drain fields in Großlappen= With astonishing foresight, Höch planned the planting of septic drain fields in the north of Munich at Großlappen. =Investments= Höch acquired extensive land in parts of Munich like Nymphenburg, Obersendling, and Menzing. He had a copper mine in the Rhön and acquired plantations overseas. He funded balloon projects, and founded magazines and a shoe factory. = Project industrial district Freimann= Höch tried to establish an industrial district in Freimann. Following the pattern of Heilmann & Littmann's Industrieviertel on the Sendlinger Oberfeld, he planned the construction of an industrial district in northern Schwabing at the direction of . He had already acquired 1,000 reason. He was ruined again because authorities opposed his plan and because his bad business practices did not keep pace with reality. During this time, half pages with the court auction announcements of Höch's property often appeared in Münchner Neueste Nachrichten. =Third and last bankruptcy= Finally, in 1904, Höch's empire broke, which greatly boosted the city's economy. It was Höch's third and last bankruptcy and, at the time, the largest bankruptcy in Munich—428 appointments in front of the chamber of commerce. A creditor consortium summoned Höch to declare his bankruptcy. Höch confessed that he had a spinal cord condition which made him unable to give exhaustive information about his entire estate. The consortium accepted this as credible. Later life and death The last photographic portrait of Höch shows a man affected by illness, whose eyes look tired and inward. Once Munich's most daring construction and land speculation entrepreneur, Höch died a bachelor on April 8, 1905, in his last apartment on Franz Josef Straße 27. Gerhard J.

From an 1860 copy by Constantin Lecca, who was himself a Paharnic The Paharnic (plural: Paharnici; also known as Păharnic, Paharnec, or Păharnec; Moldavian dialect: Ceașnic,Biliarsky, pp. 331–333; Rezachevici (1971), p. 24; Stoicescu, p. 79; Tașcă, passim , Pakharnikos,Iorga (1932), p. 219 & 1934, pp. 206–207 , Paharnik) was a historical Romanian rank, one of the non-hereditary positions ascribed to the boyar aristocracy in Moldavia and Wallachia (the Danubian Principalities). It was the local equivalent of a Cup-bearer or Cześnik, originally centered on pouring and obtaining wine for the court of Moldavian and Wallachian Princes. With time, it became a major administrative office and, in Wallachia, also had a lesser military function. The retinue of such boyars, usually called Păhărnicei, was in both countries also a private army. Dating back to ca. 1400, the Paharnici were at the forefront of political life in Wallachia over the following two centuries, often as a title associated with the Craiovești and Florescu boyars. Wallachian Paharnici were especially important during the 16th and 17th centuries, when they included figures such as Lupu Mehedințeanu, Șerban of Coiani, and Matei Basarab. They and other Paharnici established means of boyar protection against the social ascent of immigrant Greeks. Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu, himself a former Paharnic, gave a privileged position to the Păhărnicei, but put to death their controversial Paharnic, Staico Bucșanu. Before 1700, figures associated with the Moldavian office included close relatives of the monarchs, such as Alexandru Coci and Ștefan Lupașcu Hâjdău. Though the office itself steadily declined in importance, it was still subjected to a meritocratic reform by Prince Dimitrie Cantemir. The Paharnici grew in numbers and declined in political relevancy from ca. 1720, with the rise of the Phanariotes, and ultimately fell into a second class of boyars. Their descendants were recognized as a branch of the small boyardom, alongside the Păhărnicei. While these became a rural middle class, the Paharnici offices were increasingly permeable to the commercial classes of the city. The three groups intertwined, with some Paharnici, including Ianache Hafta and Manuc Bei, having a noted effect on the development of Bucharest. Various Paharnici also participated first-hand in the cultivation of Romanian nationalism, leading up to Gavril Istrati's clashes with the Greek \\"Sacred Band\\". From Moldavia, the office was for a while inherited by the Russian Empire, which preserved titular Paharnici in its Bessarabia Governorate. In both Moldavia and Wallachia, the Russian regime of 1834–1854 recognized a multitude of titular Paharnici, from inspectors Ion Heliade Rădulescu and Constantin N. Brăiloiu to painter Constantin Lecca. The proliferation of Paharnici and other offices, taken up by Moldavian Princes Ioan and Mihail Sturdza, contributed to social tensions, and then to a failed revolutionary attempt. Following the Crimean War, the position of Paharnic was abolished, alongside all other historical titles. Name Paharnic is a Romanianized term, originating with the Church Slavonic variant, (Peharnik).Panaitescu, p. 214 Dimitrie Cantemir, the intellectual Prince of Moldavia, was the first to note that the institution was copied from the old Serbian nomenclature, as opposed to other boyar titles, which were originally Byzantine or (in one case) Hungarian.Bacalov, p. 60 However, legal historian Ivan Biliarsky notes that both the Serbian and the Romanian term originate with a Byzantine office, the Pinkernes, being its functional equivalents.Bilarsky, pp. 329–331, 334–335 The component Romanian term is pahar (\\"glass\\" or \\"chalice\\"), which reached Romanian either from the Hungarian pohár or the Serbo-Croatian pehar.Chirilă, p. 31 After passing through Slavonic, Paharnic acquired a form in historical Romanian, and Romanian Cyrillic, as , transliterated Păharnic (, rather than ). It was still codified in this manner by the early-18th-century scholar Anthim the Iberian.Chirilă, pp. 31, 92, 163, 272 All these terms continued to be spelled in Cyrillic for as long as the titles they represented were in use. However, attempts at Romanization were made as early as 1468, when Paharnic appeared as Poharnig in a Renaissance Latin document;Mihaela Paraschiv, \\"Elemente lexicale alogene în latina documentelor de cancelarie din Moldova\\", in Analele Universității Alexandru Ioan Cuza din Iași. Secțiunea IIIe. Lingvistică, Vol. LIV, p. 116 this was also rendered as Paharnig.Biliarsky, p. 332 In the 1670s, Miron Costin, using standardized Polish spellings, produced Paharnik.Raluca Elisabeta Iftime, \\"Modelul ortografic polonez în scrieri ale unor cărturari moldoveni din secolele al XVI-lea și al XVII-lea (Luca Stroici și Miron Costin)\\", in Rodica Zafiu, Isabela Nedelcu (eds.), Variația lingvistică: probleme actuale.

Fresco from Sucevița Monastery, illustrating the Book of Revelation as well as the Book of Isaiah Paharnici or similar were first mentioned in Wallachia under Mircea the Old (1386–1418) and in Moldavia under Alexander the Good (1400–1432).Rezachevici (1971), p. 24 The Moldavian version of the office ranked it immediately after the Spatharios; in Wallachia, it was originally mentioned as below the Vistier, who was fourth or fifth in line in the Boyar Council: the Ban, Vornic, Logothete, and sometimes also the Spatharios, ranked above them.Rezachevici (1971), pp. 22–24 A social and functional differentiation cut across these boyar classes. According to such typologies, some boyar offices were administrative or \\"public\\" (Ban or Logothete), while others, including Ban and Spatharios, were purely military. Paharnici fell into a third category of offices, deemed \\"courtly\\" (de curte)—alongside Cluceri, Jitniceri, Medelniceri, Pitari, Postelnici, Slugeri, and Stolnici.Palade, p. 144 As summarized by historian Constantin Rezachevici, a Paharnics function was \\"to fill up the first cup at the prince's table, and while in the country he supervised the princely vineyards and made sure that these were well kept\\".Rezachevici (1971), p. 24 Biliarsky also notes that the Paharnic acted as a waiter and a wine taster, who made sure that the beverage was safe to drink, being thus \\"close to and very highly trusted by the ruler.\\"Biliarsky, pp. 331–332 From the beginning, these attributes alternated with the business of state: in October 1407, Paharnic Iliaș \\"Dumitrovscio\\" was present on the Moldavian delegation which swore fealty to the Kingdom of Poland, and consequently fought at Grunwald.Tașcă, pp. 7–8, 14 A variation of the office, already present in 1540s Moldavia, was the Paharnic in service to the Princess-consort.Rezachevici (1977), p. 78 Also in Moldavia, Paharnici had direct control over the Staroste of Cotnari, who produced the eponymous sweet wine variety, seen as the region's best,Rezachevici (1971), p. 24. See also Aramă & Jecev, p. 3 as well as over the wine regions of Dealu Morii, Hârlău, Huși, and Târgu Trotuș.Stoicescu, p. 79 After 1482, the Moldavian institution also appeared in the wine-rich Panciu, Putna County, which had been previously disputed between the two principalities.Pușcă, pp. 359–361 By 1700, the greater Paharnic was, ex officio, the head of Putna's administration, while his assistant only controlled the princely vineyards of Huși.Mihordea, p. 1090 Historian N. Stoicescu proposes that the Wallachian Paharnici may have also exercised some control over the winemakers of Dealurile Buzăului. This function remains unattested, but is suggested by the Paharnici being traditionally reliant on support from that area, on the Wallachian border with Putna.Stoicescu, p. 79 In tandem, Paharnici in both principalities operated as tax farmers, receiving a small contribution from all other winemakers. This was presented to them personally on September 14 of each year.Rezachevici (1971), p. 24 Moldavia's Paharnic collected only the wine tithe known as vinărici.Stoicescu, p. 79 For the Wallachians, the vinărici was set at 1,000 barrels of wine yearly, from the wineries of Argeș County (Ștefănești, Topoloveni) and Vâlcea County (Drăgășani).Mihordea, p. 1090 Here, another special tribute, also collected from private wine cellars, was generally known as păhărnicie, and was primarily lucrative in Bucharest.C. C. Giurescu, pp. 346, 354–355; Stoicescu, pp. 78–79. See also Mihordea, p. 1090 18th-century sources inform that the Paharnic of Wallachia also collected the wine tax known as cămănărit, which had its origins in feudal aid (plocon).Al. Constantinescu, \\"Ploconul\\", in Studii și Materiale de Istorie Medie, Vol. VI, 1973, p. 220. See also Mihordea, p. 1090 =Early feudal revolts= Vlad the Impaler's envoys capturing the boyars during a feast (April 1457), in an 1860s painting by Theodor Aman The Paharnici were assisted by their own private army, the Păhărnicei (\\"little Paharnici\\", singular Păhărnicel). At least originally, these were junior members of the aristocracy: the first known Moldavian Păhărnicel, mentioned as such in December 1437, was a Pan Ureche. He had earlier been Iliaș I's Paharnic, and went on to become his Vornic in 1438.Stoicescu, p. 78 At some point in or after 1479, Stephen the Great rewarded another Păhărnicel, Cârstea, with the deeds to Coșești village.Cătălina Chelcu, Marius Chelcu, \\"«...din uricul pe care strămoșii lor l-au avut de la bătrânul Ștefan voievod». Întregiri documentare\\", in Petronel Zahariuc, Silviu Văcaru (eds.), Ștefan cel Mare la cinci secole de la moartea sa, p. 150. Iași: Editura Alfa, 2003. Also in Moldavia, Paharnici were the only ones mandated to pass judgment in cases involving their retinue.Aramă & Jecev, p. 2 Other records show that they (assisted by the relevant Pârcălabi) passed judgment in all cases directly involving wine, either at Cotnari or Hârlău.Aramă & Jecev, p. 3 The Paharnici were nevertheless entirely subject to the Prince's expedient justice, as already shown in the 1480s, when Stephen the Great ordered the execution of his Paharnic Negrilă, for reasons unrecorded.Panaitescu, p. 150 During the Wallachian 15th century, the titles of Paharnic and Ban were closely associated with a family known as Craiovești. Its founder, Barbu I, emerged ca. 1431 as Paharnic of Alexander I Aldea, sitting on the Boyar Council, but was probably chased out of the country by Vlad II Dracul.Oprea, pp. 133–136 This period highlighted the civil war between the houses of Dănești, to whom the Craiovești were loyal, and the family of Vlad II, or Drăculești. A differentiation of boyar offices first occurred in Wallachia under Dănești rulers. Vladislav II (1447–1456) created the Craiovești family as his Vlastelini, presumably meaning \\"strong\\" or \\"immovable boyars\\".Donat, pp. 178–179 That category included the Paharnic alongside the Ban, Vornic, Logothete and other lesser dignities. Most of these functions (20/34) went to boyars who were also family with the Prince, descending from the earlier House of Basarab.Donat, p. 179 Later in the 1450s, Vlad the Impaler staged a boyar purge, reportedly killing all of his Council who identified the Dănești as actual Princes.Palade, pp. 145–147 In 1482, Basarab Țepeluș, who also relegated the Craiovești, raised his Paharnic Mircea to a second position in the Council ranks.Oprea, p. 137 The first Craiovești Prince, Neagoe Basarab (reigned 1512–1521), assigned the office of Paharnic to a more distant relative, Drăghici Florescu, to whom he also gave ownership of Tismana.Donat, p. 168 The Teachings, a political treatise often attributed to Neagoe, go further in proposing that the office of Paharnic be assigned to foreign mercenaries, thus ensuring meritocracy. Historian P. P. Panaitescu notes that this detail, as well as the designation of Paharnici as Credinciari, establishes that the book is a forgery.Panaitescu, pp. 214–215 The Wallachian Paharnic was also a rank in the feudal levy army, commanding the Păhărnicei as a mounted corps.Rezachevici (1971), p. 24 The latter, alongside lesser boyars in service to the Paharnici, formed a special military corps and fiscal category, separate from the retinues of other boyar ranks. There were probably 13 such \\"orders\\" in 1580s Moldavia,Stoicescu, p. 66 where the Păhărnicei themselves were still relevant landowners. Before 1600, a Păhărnicel Ionașcu owned the entire village of Drăgușeni, which his family later sold to Prince Miron Barnovschi.Aristotel Crîșmaru, \\"Drăgușenii în documente istorice (fragmente din monografie)\\", in Hierasus, Vol. II, 1980, pp. 239–240 Nevertheless, the office of Paharnic in itself did not guarantee financial independence. In 1557, under Wallachia's Pătrașcu the Good, Paharnic Vlad of Bârsești became financially destitute and, as one record shows, even faced starvation.Donat, pp. 103–104 =Michael the Brave's boyars= Michael the Brave and his military commanders, as depicted in 1857 by Nicolae Grigorescu With the delegation of military power came the Paharnics involvement in more rebellions. This also coincided with the increase of power for the Ottoman Empire, which was Wallachia and Moldavia's suzerain power throughout the Late Medieval and Early Modern eras. In the early 1540s, a holder of the title, Stroe Florescu, followed Șerban of Izvorani and fought against Wallachian Prince Radu Paisie; both rebels were executed.Donat, pp. 65–66 At around the same time, Moldavia's Petru Rareș was facing boyar rebellions in Cârligătura County, confiscating a village from Paharnic Ștefan Mânjea and donating another to the loyalist replacement, Nicoară.Rezachevici (1977), pp. 78–79 The 1570s witnessed one of several wars between the two principalities, with Moldavia's John III occupying Bucharest, allowing Radu Paisie's putative grandson, Vintilă, to take over as Prince of Wallachia. This days-long reign was probably ended by the supporters of Alexandru Mircea, including a Paharnic Bratu.Paul Cernovodeanu, Nicolae Vătămanu, \\"Considerații asupra 'calicilor' bucureșteni în veacurile al XVII-lea și al XVIII-lea. Cîteva identificări topografice legate de așezările lor\\", in București. Materiale de Istorie și Muzeografie, Vol. III, 1965, p. 32 In the early 1580s, one of Vintilă's surviving brothers, Prince Petru Cercel, ordered the execution of another rebellious Paharnic, Gonțea.Donat, p. 86 In 1595, Vintilă and Cercel's alleged brother, Michael the Brave, took up the anti-Ottoman cause in the Long Turkish War. Shortly after, he punished his Paharnic Iane of Boleasca, taking over Iane's estate at Daia. This was possibly a payback for cowardice shown in the battle of Călugăreni.Donat, pp. 88, 143, 144 Instead, Michael's other Paharnici were held in high esteem for their service, and received villages from Michael's personal land fund: Lupu Mehedințeanu took the villages of Dobra and Ponorălul; Paharnic Turturea was awarded Găuriciu.Donat, pp. 213, 214, 224 A mercenary commander, known as Necula Paharnic, was also awarded the village of Roșiani, in Romanați County.Donat, p. 232 Among the holders of the Paharnic title since the days of Mihnea Turcitul was a matrilineal Craiovești, Șerban of Coiani, who successfully litigated over his family's assets.Donat, pp. 40–41, 158 Șerban continued to serve under Michael the Brave and his son Nicolae Pătrașcu, selling his estates at Seaca de Pădure and Segarcea to the former.Donat, pp. 231, 232, 234 In 1600, having already conquered the Principality of Transylvania, Michael also extended his rule into Moldavia. The uprooted Movilești regime of Moldavia continued to exist in exile, receiving crucial backing from the loyalist Paharnic and diplomat, Ion Caraiman.Ioan D. Condurachi, \\"Diplomați români în trecut (sec. XIV—XVII) (II)\\", in Țara Bârsei, Vol. IX, Issues 4–5, July–October 1937, pp. 354–360; Silvia Dulschi, \\"Țările române în sistemul relațiilor diplomatice medievale\\", in Administrarea Publică, Issue 3/2016, pp. 135–139 The following year, during the troubles that followed Michael's downfall, Șerban of Coiani was elected Wallachian Prince by the boyar assembly at Sălătrucu, taking the new name of Radu Șerban.Ionașcu (1961), pp. 703–710 This new ruler extended his protection to Michael's other associates. Turturea was present by Michael's side at Câmpia Turzii, where Michael was assassinated. He rescued his lord's severed head and kept it as a relic.Donat, p. 224 Radu Șerban's court also included Mehedințeanu as a Paharnic, until 1611, when he defected to the Ottoman-appointed Prince, Radu Mihnea.Ionașcu (1961), p. 713 The office of Paharnic was also a major station in the career of Matei Basarab, a junior Craiovești boyar; in 1612, Matei began using a personal seal that showed the Paharnic seated on a throne and carrying his special cane.D. Cernovodeanu, p. 74 Radu Șerban's regime, allied with the Holy Roman Empire, was finally ended by the Ottomans. The deposed Prince tried to return by way of Moldavia, supported by the local Prince, Alexandru Movilă. However, Costea Bucioc, the Moldavian Paharnic, ended this campaign by refusing to fight.Horia Dumitrescu, \\"Un putnean pe tronul Moldovei: Ștefan Tomșa al II-lea (1611–1614, 1621–1623)\\", in Cronica Vrancei, Vol. XI, 2011, p. 47 Mehedințeanu, who continued to serve as Paharnic, found himself at odds with the new establishment and especially the Greek immigrants, fleeing the country during the reign of Alexandru IV Iliaș (1616–1618).Donat, p. 227; C. C. Giurescu, p. 69; Rezachevici (1978), pp. 64–72 He returned as leader of a popular revolt, taking control of both Bucharest and Târgoviște, where he inspired an anti-Greek pogrom. Appointed Prince by the Ottomans, Gabriel Movilă handed Mehedințeanu over to Iskender Pasha, who ordered the Paharic impaled at Ciocănești.C. C. Giurescu, p. 69; Rezachevici (1978), pp. 67–72 A decade later, under Leon Tomșa, the office of Paharnic was held by a Greek, Balasache Muselim, whose tenure sparked another revolt, which peaked at Bucharest and had Matei Basarab among its leaders.C. C. Giurescu, p. 78; Rezachevici (1978), pp. 73–76 The movement was weakened when Prince Leon appointed locals to the higher offices, making Barbu Brădescu his new Paharnic. Brădescu switched sides in 1632, helping to seize Wallachia's throne for Matei.Rezachevici (1978), pp. 75–76 In ca. 1655, the Paharnics private army was largely amassed on the border with Moldavia: in Buzău and Râmnicu Sărat Counties there were 300–400 Păhărnicei. These were commanded by a Captain, 6 Iuzbași, and 6 Ceauși.Stoicescu, p. 77 By that moment in history, Paharnici had declined in relative importance. This was manifest under Matei Basarab, who ordered his new Paharnic, Chisar Rudeanu, to be caned in the throne room, then jailed.Rezachevici (1978), p. 77 Under his regime, the Păhărnicei and other servants of the Paharnic owed a yearly tax of 8 ducats, while boyars subordinated to the Spatharios paid 12.Stoicescu, pp. 66, 77, 89 Both countries' Paharnici were soon outranked by the Stolnici and Comiși; in Wallachia, however, they continued to command the Păhărnicei, and were also placed in charge of a new cavalry force, the Roșii (\\"Redcoats\\").Rezachevici (1971), pp. 22, 24–25 Both groups fought alongside the Ottoman Army in the Polish war of 1672.Stoicescu, pp. 66, 82 =Cantacuzino era= After 1650, some Wallachian Paharnici opposed the steady rise of the Cantacuzino family, whose scion Drăghici Cantacuzino also held the title in 1661–1662,Ionașcu (1934), p. 18 while others embraced it. Among the anti-Cantacuzino boyars, 1660s Paharnic Constantin Vărzarul plotted, alongside Stroe Leurdeanu, to have Constantin I Cantacuzino unlawfully executed.C. C. Giurescu, p. 78 Another such conflict erupted in the early 1680s between Prince Șerban Cantacuzino and his Paharnic, Papa Buicescul (son of the Spatharios Diicul).Ionașcu (1934), p. 16 Under the Cantacuzinos, the lesser Paharnici were all placed under the command of the greater Paharnic, who organized them into a single military unit.Stoicescu, p. 77 By then, the armed retinues, and those of all other high-ranking boyars, were collectively known as Feciori (\\"Young Men\\" or \\"Boys\\") or Slugi (\\"Servants\\"). With the peak of serfdom in both countries, these Feciori were exclusively recruited from among free or manumitted peasants.Stoicescu, pp. 63–64 According to historian Constantin Giurescu, the Wallachian Păhărnicei, as a special set of Feciori, might have been supporting themselves from păhărnicie revenues, which they collected for their patron.Stoicescu, p. 78 This practice is attested in Moldavia, where, following the drought of September 1663, Princess Ecaterina Dabija warned Feciori not to collect the tithe from Armenians and Jews, as this would have exhausted the supply.Stoicescu, p. 79 A Cantacuzino ally, Constantin Brâncoveanu, took the throne in 1688, replacing Șerban. He himself had for long been a regular boyar, first serving as a Paharnic when he was aged 17.Panaitescu, p. 462 During his subsequent reign, the Păhărnicei appear to have been almost exclusively confined to Râmnicu Sărat County, with some also present in Mehedinți County.Stoicescu, pp. 76, 78 Scholar Alexandru Ligor notes that, \\"during and especially after Brâncoveanu's era\\", the Păhărnicei and other such boyar retinues \\"will be more seriously engaged in productive life (in agriculture, in trades, etc.).\\"Ligor, p. 263 Brâncoveanu's reign was overall marked by a steady increase in taxation, but the Păhărnicei were explicitly excluded from some of the new duties, including a levy on vacated villages (siliști). Ligor proposes that this exemption reflected the Prince's military priorities, and his secret anti-Ottoman alliance with the Tsardom of Russia.Ligor, pp. 263–264 Brâncoveanu's first Paharnic was Staico Bucșanu, whose scheming against the regime ended with his public hanging at Bucharest's Outer Market.C. C. Giurescu, p. 72; Ionașcu (1934), p. 25; Potra I, p. 370 His public humiliation and killing were received with hostility by the Bucharest populace.Potra I, p. 370 The period thus inaugurated came with a set of administrative reforms, recorded in the princely register, or Anatefter. This shows Paharnic as one of the great offices, but also creates an overlapping function therein, as Cupar (from cupă, \\"cup\\"); at the top of boyar advancement, these two offices coexisted with Spatharios, Stolnic, Clucer, and another new office, that of Șufar (the intendant of kitchen staffs).D. C. Giurescu, p. 361 Under Brâncoveanu, these particular offices were designated as Zvolearnici. In addition to receiving payment from the exercise of their offices, they relied on princely handouts, including kaftans colored in accordance with their function.D. C. Giurescu, pp. 361–362 Until his own downfall in 1714, Brâncoveanu relied on various other noblemen to fill in Bucșanu's role. One of these, Cornea Brăiloiu, served the Prince as both ambassador and organizer of defense expeditions against the Kurucok.Vasile Marinoiu, \\"Marele ban Cornea Brăiloiu și mănăstirea Tismana în timpul domniei lui Constantin Brâncoveanu\\", in Drobeta. Seria Arheologie–Istorie, Vol. XXIV, 2014, pp. 114, 124, 126, 130 In 1696, the Greek Paharnic Vergo was part of a caretaker government of Caimacami.C. C. Giurescu, p. 344 The following year, Brâncoveanu had another Greek Paharnic, Skarlatakes Mavrocordatos, son of the influential Alexander Mavrocordatos. In October, Skarlatakes married the Prince's daughter, Ilinca.Potra I, p. 105 Brâncoveanu also promoted Șerban II Cantacuzino as Paharnic, in which capacity Cantacuzino attended, in 1702, the formal meeting between the Prince and Baron Paget.Potra I, p. 106 Brăiloiu returned as Paharnic under the last Cantacuzino Prince, Ștefan, with increased powers that allowed him to set an arbitrary vinărici and \\"collect wine as he pleases\\".Mihordea, pp. 1080, 1090 Moldavia's own Paharnici and Păhărnicei greatly increased in number between 1550 and 1650; by 1710, some 24 were permanently present at the princely court in Iași, acting as waiters to the Moldavian Princes' foreign guests.Stoicescu, p. 78 Though the office's prestige declined, various Moldavian rulers maintained a practice of assigning it, alongside other offices, to their most trusted courtiers, often members of the monarchs' own families. Vasile Lupu (reigned 1634–1653) made his young nephew, Alexandru Coci, a Paharnic; meanwhile Lupu's in-laws, including Paharnici Alexandru Ciogolea and Neculai Mogâldea, were involved in conspiracies to topple him.Alexandra-Marcela Popescu, \\"Câteva considerații privind înrudirea unor boieri hicleni cu familia domnitoare în Moldova medievală\\", in Analele Științifice ale Universității Alexandru Ioan Cuza din Iași. Istorie, Vols. LIV–LV, 2008–2009, pp. 52, 55–56 Coci and his brother Enache were later tortured and killed by Lupu's rival, Gheorghe Ștefan, at the princely court in Podoleni.Bacalov, p. 402; Dan Mihăilescu, \\"O ctitorie a domnitorului moldovean Gheorghe Ștefan în județul Neamț\\", in Acta Moldaviae Meridionalis, Vols. XV–XVII (Part I), 2004–2006, p. 186 In the 1670s, holders of the Paharnic title included Ștefan Lupașcu Hâjdău, who was both a close relative and in-law of Prince Ștefan Petriceicu.Bezviconi I, p. 244; Costin Feneșan, \\"Indigenatul austriac al familiei nobiliare Hâjdău\\", in Archiva Moldaviae, Vol. II, 2010, p. 27 The office of Cupar also existed in Moldavia, for instance during Petriceicu's successor Antonie Ruset, who assigned it to his brother Constantin. This function was alluded to in the canting arms used by the Rosetti family, which prominently feature a silver cup.Sorin Iftimi, \\"Heraldică și arhitectură\\", in Monumentul, Vol. VII, 2006, p. 498 Moldavia also experienced a Cantacuzino ascendancy, which resulted in the promotion of Greek boyars, to the irritation of local competitors. The latter sentiment was notably expressed in the anti-Greek outburst of 1673, narrated favorably by chronicler Ion Neculce. It came shortly after Dumitrașcu Cantacuzino abdicated, and targeted his courtiers, notably the Paharnic Mavrodin, who was paraded on a donkey and made to speak shibboleth phrases in Romanian.Hoinărescu, pp. 41–42 Upon returning to the throne, Petriceicu maintained a court that included Greek boyars such as Ilie Stamatie, who was a Paharnic of Huși.Bacalov, pp. 335, 370 By 1703, the Moldavian Cantacuzinos were in conflict with the Greek Prince Constantine Ducas, with Paharnic Ilie Cantacuzino fleeing the country.Bacalov, p. 335 Brâncoveanu's contemporary Dimitrie Cantemir, a native boyar and Enlightened absolutist, strove to reform the old order, appointing distinguished soldiers, such as Adam Luca, as his Paharnici.Iorga (1934), p. 218 Under Cantemir, the Postelnic was the seventh of eight boyars admitted to a privy council, while the Păhărnicei were inducted en masse into a category called boiernași (\\"little boyars\\").Bacalov, pp. 59–60, 359–360 His second and final reign was curbed by the Pruth River Campaign, during which Cantemir supported Russia. When he left into exile, he took with him Neculce and the Paharnic Gheorghiță, both of them against their will.Bacalov, p. 21 =Phanariote reforms= 1772 seal of a Wallachian Paharnic, Manolache Robe Progressively over the 1710s, competing dynasties of culturally Greek aristocrats, collectively known as \\"Phanariotes\\", took power as Ottoman intermediaries in both Wallachia and Moldavia. The first such ruler, Nicholas Mavrocordatos, awarded tax privileges to the Paharnici, exempting them from the levy on siliști.Stoicescu, pp. 77–78 The Păhărnicei continued to be a strong presence in the borderland region of Wallachia, where in 1729 they still had a corps and a Captain.Stoicescu, p. 78 Overtures were made to tone down conflicts between the Romanians and the Greeks in Moldavia, such as when Grigore II Ghica refused to prosecute a treasonous Paharnic Gavriil.Hoinărescu, p. 45 In 1754, Matei Ghica created more resources for the two Paharnici of Panciu, allowing them to collect half of the tax revenue previously kept by the Staroste.Camariano-Cioran, pp. 509, 510; Pușcă, p. 360; Mihordea, pp. 1090, 1096–1097 However, the erosion of Paharnici importance continued and was enhanced: under the same Matei Ghica, who ruled over both countries in succession, twenty Paharnici were created at each court. While some historians credit this anomaly to the Prince,Grina-Mihaela Rafailă, \\"Actele domniei lui Matei Ghica aflate în colecția de documente a Muzeului Municipiului București\\", in București. Materiale de Istorie și Muzeografie, Vol. XXIX, 2015, p. 251; Viorica Răileanu, \\"Mărturii antroponimice privind unele funcții dregătorești\\", in Ovidiu Felecan (ed.), Numele și numirea: actele Conferinței Internaționale de Onomastică, Ediția 1: Interferențe multietnice în antroponimie, Baia Mare, 19–21 septembrie 2011, p. 204. Cluj- Napoca: Editura Mega, 2011. others identify his Postelnic, Alexandros Soutzos, as the culprit.Camariano-Cioran, p. 505 Matei's predecessor, Mihai Racoviță, had redesigned the Wallachian table of ranks, making Paharnic the eighth position, within a second category of boyars. Accordingly, Paharnici were entitled to 40 scutelnici, or clients, and had a yearly salary of 960 thaler; by comparison, all boyars of the first class received 70 scutelnici and 1,680 thaler.Ioana Constantinescu, \\"Aspecte ale destrămării feudalismului în Țara Românească și Moldova la sfîrșitul secolului al XVIII-lea și începutul secolului al XIX-lea: 'Oamenii de scuteală'\\", in Studii și Materiale de Istorie Medie, Vol. IX, 1978, pp. 15–16 As noted by historian Pompiliu Eliade, \\"an inflexible protocol govern[ed] the relationship between classes.\\"Eliade, p. 63 Third-class boyars were required to bow down and kiss the hem of first- class superiors. Paharnici and others of the intermediary class were only expected to kiss their hand and display timidity in interactions.Eliade, pp. 62–63 Under the new Phanariote regulations, these second-class aristocrats could not wear fur kaftans and had special kalpaks, surmounted by green cushions; their coats could only be colored in dark tones of green, blue, and brown, but, unlike inferior boyars, they were allowed to grow beards.Adrian- Silvan Ionescu, \\"Spune-mi cu ce te îmbraci, ca să-ți spun cine ești\\", in Magazin Istoric, February 2001, pp. 64–66 In parallel, scholar Nicolae Iorga notes, Wallachia's \\"old cursus honorum had yielded to personal assets or demands.\\" Before 1796, the Paharnici had fallen to ninth or tenth place, but only because higher offices had been \\"doubled\\"—for instance, in 1768 there were two Wallachian Vornici.Iorga (1933), pp. 10–11 Another stratification occurred in Moldavia. There were 27 Paharnici at Grigore Callimachi's court: 13 enjoyed the full privileges; 14 were secondary (vtori-) and tertiary (treti-) Paharnici.Ghibănescu, pp. 72, 73 There were still 14 Păhărnicei performing military duty at the Moldavian court in 1763. Their commander, now called Vătaf (plural: Vătafi), was a Greek boyar, Miche.Ghibănescu, pp. 73, 75 Reduced to the role of rural legatees of the urban Paharnic, the Păhărnicei of both countries were then stripped of all their remaining tax privileges under Constantine Mavrocordatos; the Paharnici themselves were required to pay for any military levy.Rădescu, pp. 136–138 Nevertheless, these new norms also stipulated that holders of any boyar rank from the top 19 would be spared taxation. That privilege was also extended to three generations of their descendants, known as Mazili or Mazâli.Berindei & Gavrilă, pp. 2033, 2036–2041; Rădescu, pp. 137–139. See also Bacalov, pp. 59–60 A Western visitor, Friedrich Wilhelm von Bauer, assessed that Mavrocordatos' intervention had only left 100 Păhărnicei throughout Wallachia, with 12 more performing service for the Prince as Mazili.Stoicescu, p. 78 By 1760, the boyars, including three Paharnici, had lodged a formal complaint against Mavrocordatos with Sultan Mustafa III, accusing him of embezzlement.Iorga (1934), pp. 205–207 Shortly after Mavrocordatos' death in the Russian occupation of 1769, the chronicler Franz Sulzer noted that the function of Moldavia's great Paharnic was to reside in Cotnari and collect revenue for Princess-dowager Ecaterina. The town, Sulzer noted, had greatly declined.Horst Fassel, Sorin Chițanu, \\"Botoșanii în jurnalele de călătorie germane\\", in Hierasus, Vol. I, 1979, p. 338 Before 1810, the Paharnic had fallen to an even lesser position on the table of ranks of Moldavia. It was twelfth, although ahead of the Stolnic and Serdar.Bezviconi I, p. 18; Iorga (1933), p. 11 The Păhărniceis Vătafi moved in the opposite direction and, by 1796, had been recognized as a component of Wallachia's fifth-class boyardom.Berindei & Gavrilă, p. 2035 Paharnici and Păhărnicei also had a decorative function at the ceremonies in honor of Wallachia's Phanariote Princes, notably at the coronations of Alexander Ypsilantis (1775) and Nicholas Mavrogenes (1786), and the wedding of Princess Zamfira, daughter of John Caradja (1782).Potra I, pp. 71, 73, 76–77, 81, 88, 122 Some of the holders of the title focused their activity on cultural and educational projects. In Oltenia, Romanian or Greek schools were founded by local Paharnici, including Fota Vlădoianu (Craiova, 1777), Stan Jianu (Preajba, 1783), and Alexandru Farfara (Cerneți, 1793).Maria Bălan, \\"Contribuții la istoria învățământului din Oltenia în secolul al XVIII- lea\\", in Studii și Materiale de Istorie Medie, Vol. VI, 1973, pp. 292, 293 The 1780s Paharnic Mihail Fotino, a Wallachian Greek, became noted for his contributions to jurisprudence and moral philosophy.Valentin Al. Georgescu, \\"Protimisisul in Manualele de legi din 1765, 1766 și 1777 ale lui Mihail Fotino.

Seria Istorie, Vol. XIV, Issue 2, 2009, pp. 127–128 =As a middle-class and nationalist layer= \\"Second-rank boyars\\" of Wallachia, depicted in 1825 by Auguste de Henikstein Other Paharnici were primarily involved in administrative or entrepreneurial work. Under Prince John Mavrocordatos, the Bucharest caretakers, or ispravnici, comprised Paharnic Nicolae Ruset.C. C. Giurescu, p. 344 In 1724, Paharnic Manolache owned one of the larger Bucharest bakeries.C. C. Giurescu, p. 279 By 1804, Wallachian dignitaries included an Armenian businessman and Paharnic, Manuc Bei, made famous by his establishing of Manuc's Inn.C. C. Giurescu, p. 324; Siruni, pp. 33–34, 70, 73, 74 In 1800, while reigning in Wallachia, Mourouzis appointed his Paharnic Ștefănică, alongside Constantin Pastia, to redesign a system for Bucharest's drainage and sewage.Potra I, pp. 173–174 In 1819, Wallachian Prince Alexandros Soutzos ordered his Paharnic, Ianache Hafta, to carry out a modern surveying of Bucharest.C. C. Giurescu, p. 265; Potra I, pp. 175, 203, 223 Another Paharnic, Vasile Iconomu, helped Spatharios Gheorghe Vlahuț in capturing a gang of English counterfeiters.Potra II, p. 243 Moldavia's second-class boyars were similarly dedicated to commercial pursuits. Around 1740, Paharnic Radu Racoviță established a pioneering glass factory at Luizi-Călugăra.P. Cernovodeanu, pp. 487 While ranked as Paharnici, Ioniță Cuza took up usury (1770s) and Ionică Tăutu became one of the major tenant farmers in Hotin County (1810).P. Cernovodeanu, pp. 483, 484 Frictions between the Phanariotes and the provincial second-class boyars continued with some regularity. In one incident of 1799, Paharnic Constantin Bălăceanu of Ialomița County refused to carry out an order issued by Constantine Hangerli.Samarian, pp. 42–43 Under Constantine Ypsilantis, another Ialomița Paharnic, Fălcoianu, was charged with embezzlement.Samarian, p. 51 With the era of national awakening, the Paharnici opposition to the Greeks extended to other classes of foreigners. In 1784, a Paharnic \\"Carpoff\\" made sustained efforts to block the penetration into Moldavia of Galician Armenians.Siruni, pp. 66–67 Paharnic Manuc remained one of only three only Armenians to have reached a boyar rank in either country under the Phanariote reigns.Siruni, p. 74 During the war of 1806, a Wallachian Paharnic, Ștefan Belu, had a publicized conflict with the Bulgarians colonized at Lichirești, who were under the protection of Dimitrie Macedonski.Samarian, pp. 38–39 The Phanariote era also pushed Moldavia and Wallachia into the orbit of the Russian Empire, prompting some boyars to accept Russian suzerainty. In the 1760s, a Paharnic, Semyon Mikulin, moved to Novorossiya and was received into Russian nobility.Bezviconi II, p. 136 In 1812, pursuant to the Treaty of Bucharest, eastern Moldavia was detached and assigned to Russia. This led to the creation of a Bessarabian Governorate which recognized Moldavian titles, including that of Paharnic, as the basis for inclusion into Russian nobility.Bezviconi I, pp. 17–18, 51 Two of the earliest Bessarabian Paharnici were Nicolae Done and Toma Stamati. From a Wallachian family, Done served as judge in Hotin County during the early 1820s; Stamati, who took part in the inaugural gentry assembly, was the father of poet Constantin Stamati.Bezviconi II, pp. 33, 66–67, 160 Yet another Paharnic under Russian rule, Dinu Negruzzi of Șirăuți was the father of writer Costache Negruzzi.Bezviconi II, p. 56 Under late Phanariotes such as Wallachia's Caradja, the rank of a lesser Paharnic was openly trafficked: Hagi Ianus, a merchant from Craiova, offered to purchase it at 400 ducats in 1816.S. Columbeanu, \\"Caracterul exploatării feudale a țărănimii în deceniile anterioare răscoalei lui Tudor Vladimirescu (1800—1820)\\", in Studii. Revistă de Istorie, Vol. XIV, Issue 3, 1961, p. 579 By the time of Soutzos' death in 1821 there were six greater Paharnici in Wallachia, all of them present at his funeral.Potra I, p. 93 According to a note by visiting bureaucrat Ignaty Yakovenko, the number of scutelnici had increased, with each of these Paharnici commanding the allegiance of 25 clients; the Păhărniceis Vătafi had three scultenici of their own.Traian Ionescu-Nișcov, \\"Un călător rus despre Principatele romîne de la 1820\\", in Revista Istorică, Vol. XXIII, Issues 4–6, April–June 1936, pp. 127–128 The rise of Wallachian clienteles was again curbed in 1821 by an anti-boyar uprising, under Tudor Vladimirescu; having a peasant base, this insurgency was probably led by disgruntled third-class boyars.Dinică Ciobotea, Vladimir Osiac, \\"1821. Tabăra pandurilor de la Țânțăreni\\", in Analele Universității din Craiova. Seria Istorie, Vol. XIV, Issue 2, 2009, p. 150 Also in 1821, the Phanariote warlord Alexander Ypsilantis, leading a \\"Sacred Band\\" of Greek revolutionaries, had taken control over Moldavia and parts of Wallachia. Ypsilantis' expedition sparked another Ottoman intervention, which provided a settling of scores between Romanians and Greeks. Second-class boyars played significant parts: according to Eliade, a Spatharios and a Paharnic traveled from one Moldavian town to another, replacing Ypsilantis' men with friendly locals.Eliade, p. 388 The Paharnic Gavril Istrati was involved alongside Sturdza in the fight against Sacred Band Greeks, at the head of a national party. At Zvoriștea, he organized a guerrilla force which flew red flags.Iorga (1919), pp. 173, 174 It then marched on Botoșani, driving out the Greek insurgents.Gorovei, pp. 21–22; Iorga (1919), pp. 173–175 =Disintegration= Casa Paharnicului in Piatra Neamț, 2012 photograph Istrati's counterpart in Wallachia was Scarlat Cerchez, who organized the reception of Moldavia's first post-Phanariote Prince, Ioan Sturdza.Samarian, pp. 56, 221 Even before arriving in his capital, Sturdza rewarded the expectations of Romanian nationalists, inducting his partisans into the boyardom. By 1825, he had created 350 second-class boyars, Paharnici included.Ungureanu, pp. 51, 54 These changes perplexed Moldavia's first-class boyardom, whose delegates asked Mahmud II to mediate.Berindei & Gavrilă, p. 2041 Eventually, the Russo-Turkish War of 1828 drove Sturdza into exile in Bessarabia. This moment showed the tensions between the two aristocratic systems, as Sturdza began handing out titles to commoners, and allegedly created a house servant as Paharnic.Bezviconi I, p. 19 The post-Phanariote agitation ended as a lengthy Russian occupation of both principalities, providing them with a modernizing constitution known as Regulamentul Organic. Under this system, Paharnici were a seventh aristocratic rank, below Cluceri and ahead of Serdari.Laurențiu Vlad, \\"Scurte note cu privire la cenzura din Țara Românească. Două episoade din biografia lui Constantin N. Brăiloiu (1849–1850, 1858)\\", in Analele Universității București. Seria Științe Politice, Vol. 4, 2002, p. 36 The Russian-appointed Moldavian Prince, Mihail Sturdza, replicated the policy of inducting new boyars, and, in 1835, raised most civil servants into the aristocracy: 140 Paharnici and 352 Serdari were counted in the census of 1849.Ungureanu, p. 54 In 1820, in Botoșani alone there were five Paharnici: Alexandru, Ion Brănișteanu, Necula Dalamaci, Gavril Istrati, and Sterie.Gorovei, pp. 79–81, 97, 100, 118, 128, 137 By 1847, the same city held six Paharnici, none of them present in the older count.Gorovei, p. 230 Nationality restrictions for Armenians were also lifted with the Treaty of Adrianople. As noted by scholar H. Dj. Siruni, 35 Armenians became Moldavian boyars in the subsequent social uplift, including Paharnici Hacic Cerchez at Roman and G. Țăranu at Botoșani.Siruni, p. 75 Sturdza's measures were derided by the genealogist Constantin Sion, himself a Paharnic. According to Sion, Sturdza had managed to make boyars out of \\"the sons of butchers and publicans\\", and \\"condemned the country to fall under his companions\\".Ungureanu, pp. 54–55 The spread of liberal and radical ideas influenced such perceptions, leading up to the abortive coup of 1848. During the preceding crisis in 1846, the Paharnic Teodor Sion was arrested, alongside Spahtarios Tucidide Durmuz, for having joined Teodor Râșcanu's attempt at tax resistance against Sturdza.Ungureanu, pp. 62–63, 65–66 The Wallachian and Moldavian military forces were both restructured, though some importance was paid to the old table of ranks and the concept of Mazili. As such, the radical conspirator Ion Câmpineanu was allowed to serve as a Wallachian Major because of his descent from a Paharnic.Hêrjeu, p. 88 By 1841, the role of Paharnici in Bucharest's government had been formalized, with Paharnic Scarlat Rosetti serving as City Council President.Potra I, p. 297 Other boyars of that rank continued to be involved primarily in trade. Pitești was home to a Paharnic Berindei, who, by 1855, was a major player in Wallachia's pork trade.Petre Popa, Paul Dicu, \\"Participarea piteștenilor la principalele evenimente ale istoriei naționale din epoca modernă\\", in Pitești, Pagini de Istorie. Studii și Comunicări, Vol. I, 1986, p. 120 In Moldavia's Piatra Neamț, the era is commemorated by a former manor-and-warehouse, known as Casa Paharnicului (\\"House of the Paharnic\\"). It was built by the boyar and grain trader Dimitrie C. Gheorghiadis, who held the office for only part of his career.Vitalie Josanu, \\"Comerţul genovez și ecouri culturale occidentale în Moldova și Dobrogea (secolele XIII–XV)\\", in Ioan Neculce.

Bucharest: Editura Academiei, 1967. Another Paharnic, the poet Grigore Alexandrescu, discarded his rank and job in the bureaucracy to participate in the revolutionary events.Bogdan- Duică, p. 255 The revolution was defeated, but Russian influence was curbed from 1853, with the Crimean War. Under the regime of Prince Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei, Wallachian revolutionaries were allowed back home from exile. They included the Paharnic Rădulescu, who alternated roles between civilian boyar and general in the Ottoman Army.Adrian-Silvan Ionescu, \\"Viața mondenă a societății bucureștene în timpul și după revoluția de la 1848\\", in Muzeul Național, Vol. XI, 1990, p. 48 Eventually, all boyar ranks and tax privileges were ended by the Convention of Paris (1858), which also opened the way for a Moldo–Wallachian union in 1859.C.

Popularly known as \\"The King of Cool\\", McQueen's screen persona was that of portraying cool, reticent antihero roles, which appealed strongly to the masses. This led him to cement his status as one of the most famous celebrities in Hollywood during the counterculture of the 1960s. After making his debut appearing in an uncredited role in the crime drama Girl on the Run (1953), McQueen featured in the Paul Newman starrer Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), where he played the uncredited role of Fidel, a member of the protagonist's gang. In 1958, he appeared in the science fiction film The Blob, which was his first film as a lead actor. It proved to be commercially successful at the box office, grossing ($ in 2019) against a budget of ($ in 2019). McQueen became known for portraying bounty hunter Josh Randall in the CBS television series Wanted Dead or Alive (1958–1961). He continued to act in films, playing the lead in The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery (1959), and in a supporting role as a corporal in Never So Few (1959), his first of three films with John Sturges. In 1960, McQueen achieved stardom when he co-starred alongside Yul Brynner in Sturges' western, The Magnificent Seven, which was based on Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai. After a series of unsuccessful films for the next two years, McQueen teamed up with Sturges again in the war drama The Great Escape (1963), where he played Virgil Hilts, a World War II prisoner of war who along with fellow Allied POWs makes an escape from a high security prisoner-of-war camp. It emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year, winning McQueen the award for Best Actor at the Moscow International Film Festival. In The Great Escape, a shot of Hilts riding a motorcycle and jumping a series of barbed-wire fences (performed by a stuntman) to escape from German soldiers is considered as one of the best stunts ever made. McQueen received his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nomination for his role of a musician in Love with the Proper Stranger (1963), where he was paired opposite Natalie Wood. He achieved critical and commercial success with The Cincinnati Kid (1965) and The Sand Pebbles (1966), with the latter garnering him the only Academy Award for Best Actor nomination of his career. In 1968, McQueen appeared as millionaire Thomas Crown in the crime film The Thomas Crown Affair, and in the thriller Bullitt as the eponymous police detective Frank Bullitt. These films fared well at the box office, with the latter garnering acclaim for its stunt sequences, particularly the car chase. For his performance in The Reivers (1969), McQueen earned a third Golden Globe Award nomination. McQueen began the 1970s with the sports drama Le Mans (1971), a fictional take on the annual 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance races. The film was a critical and commercial disappointment, leaving him almost bankrupt. He followed it by starring in two back-to-back films under Sam Peckinpah: the western Junior Bonner (1972), where he featured as the titular character, a rodeo rider, and the action film The Getaway (1972), where he appears as an ex-conman who flees to Mexico with his wife after being double-crossed by his partners-in-crime. In the latter, he was paired opposite his second wife, Ali MacGraw. Both films were critically acclaimed. While Junior Bonner did not enjoy box office success, The Getaway went on to become one of the highest-grossing films of the year, marking a comeback for McQueen. The following year, he featured alongside Dustin Hoffman in the prison film Papillon playing Henri Charrière, a prisoner convicted of murder who makes an escape attempt with fellow convict Louis Dega (Hoffman). McQueen's performance earned him his fourth and final Golden Globe Award nomination in the Best Actor category. He then starred alongside Paul Newman as a SFFD chief in the disaster drama The Towering Inferno (1974). McQueen received $12 million for acting in the film, making him the highest- paid actor in the world up to that point. The film was commercially successful, grossing ($ in 2019) against a ($ in 2019) budget. After a four- year hiatus in which he focused on his motorcycle racing career, McQueen returned to acting when he was cast against type as a scientist in An Enemy of the People. He completed two more films before his death: Tom Horn and The Hunter (both released in 1980).

It stars Ranjan Ramanayake and Ruwangi Rathnayake in lead roles along with Rex Kodippili, Sriyani Amarasena and Sarath Chandrasiri. The film was influenced by 2003 Bollywood film Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. It is the 1292nd Sri Lankan film in the Sinhala cinema. The first showing took place on 28 November 2017 at Tharangani Cinema Hall. Music Score has done by Dinesh Subasinghe. The film passed 75 days of screening successfully. Plot Nirwan Senanayake (Ranjan Ramanayake), nicknamed \\"Nawariyan\\" (literally \\"Nine feet tall man\\") is a thug: a crime don in the Colombo. Given that his father had wished him to be a medical doctor, he creates the faux Senanayake Hospital (named after his father) and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father (Rex Kodippili) and mother (Sriyani Amarasena) visit him in Colombo. One year, however, Nirwan's plan goes awry when his father meets an old friend, Dr. Dean Wickramasinghe (Srimal Wedisinghe) and the two older men decide to complete their friendship by a relationship, where Nirwan to Wickramasinghe's daughter, Dr. Bhagya \\"Pinki\\" (Ruwangi Rathnayake). At this point the truth about Nirwan is revealed by the servant of Wickramasinghe's house (Nilmini Kottegoda). Wickramasinghe insults Nirwan's parents and calls them \\"fools\\" for being ignorant of Nirwan's real life as gang leader Nawariyan. Nirwan's father and mother, aghast and later heartbroken, leave for their village. Nirwan, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Wickramasinghe is to become a doctor. He decides to go to a medical college to obtain an MBBS degree. With the help of his right-hand man Circuit (Sarath Chandrasiri) and others, Nirwan \\"gains admission\\" to a medical college, where he again encounters Dr. Wickramasinghe, who is the dean of private hospital. His success there becomes dependent upon the (coerced) help of faculty member Dr. Roshan (Sarath Kothalawala). While Nawariyan's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the \\"Magic Kiss\\" (\\"magical hug\\") – a method of comfort taught to Nirwan by his mother – and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Nirwan constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead man called \\"Ananda Ayya\\" (Rajasinghe Loluwagoda) as if the man were able to perceive and understand normally; interacts on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliates school bullies; effusively thanks a hitherto-underappreciated janitor; and encourages the patients themselves to make changes in their lives, so that they do not need drugs or surgery. Dr. Wickramasinghe, who perceives all this as symptoms of chaos, is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irrational and anger, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-dementia is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and he begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. Wickramasinghe's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, his daughter becomes increasingly fond of Nirwan, who in his turn becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here, because Nirwan is unaware that Dr. Bhagya and his childhood friend \\"Pinki\\" are one and the same; an ignorance that Bhagya hilariously exploits. Wickramasinghe tries several times to expel Nirwan but is often thwarted by Nirwan's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Nirwan, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods. Wickramasinghe keeps a challenge that Nirwan can stay in college only if he passes the exam under his supervision. Nirwan and other mates accept it. Meanwhile, cancer patient Anushka (Akila Sandakelum) is in a dying state seeking help from Nirwan. But unfortunately he dies in Nirwan's arms. Eventually, Nirwan is shamed into leaving the college: His guilt for not being able to help Anushka gets the better of him. In the moments immediately following Nirwan's departure, Ananda miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point Bhagya gives a heartfelt speech wherein she criticizes her father for having banished Nirwan, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, and happiness from the college. Wickramasinghe eventually realizes his folly. Nirwan later get to know that Dr. Bhagya, is actually \\"Pinki\\". Cast * Ranjan Ramanayake as Nirwan Senanayake a.k.a.

It is a yellow solid with low solubility in water but good solubility in DMF. The existence of two isomers of PtCl2(NH3)2 led Alfred Werner to propose square planar molecular geometry.. It belongs to the molecular symmetry point group D2h. Preparation and reactions The complex is prepared by treating [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 with hydrochloric acid. Many of the reactions of this complex can be explained by the trans effect. It slowly hydrolyzes in aqueous solution to give the mixed aquo complex trans-[PtCl(H2O)(NH3)2]Cl. Similarly it reacts with thiourea (tu) to give colorless trans-[Pt(tu)2(NH3)2]Cl2. In contrast, the cis isomer gives [Pt(tu)4]Cl2. Oxidative addition of chlorine gives trans- PtCl4(NH3)2. Medicinal chemistry trans-Dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) has had far less impact on medicinal chemistry compared to its cis isomer, cisplatin, which is a major anticancer drug. Nonetheless, replacement of the ammonia with other ligands has led to highly active drugs that have attracted much attention.

It falls under the structural class: short cationic peptides. Since it is a short cationic peptide, it can be easily synthesized, derivatized and isolated. MP196 is rich in tryptophan, a hydrophobic amino acid and arginine residues, a positively charged amino acid. It has structure: RWRWRW-NH2. This a short linear peptide with minimal pharmacophore. MP196 is effective against gram-positive bacteria and moderately effective against gram-negative bacteria. MP196 incorporates into the bacterial cytoplasmic cell membrane to bring about bacterial cell death. Differential scanning calorimetry results have shown that MP196 prefers incorporation into bacterial cell membranes over erythrocyte membranes, as this cationic peptide prefers incorporating into membranes which have a higher negatively charged phospholipid ratio. Erythrocytes are made up of neutral phospholipid, thus explaining why MP196 does not get incorporated into its membrane, because MP196 prefers negatively charged cytoplasmic membranes, it has a low hemolytic activity, and thus has low toxicity against humans. Incorporation of MP196 into the cell membrane causes detachment of cytochrome C and MurG proteins from the membrane. Cytochrome C is a protein involved in the bacterial respiratory chain and MurG is an enzyme involved in the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis pathway. These detachments, in turn, lead to limited cellular energy through the drop in the level of ATP and it undermines the cell wall integrity. Additionally, MP196 leads to osmotic destabilization in bacterial cells. These factors lead to bacterial cell death.MP196 does not need to be stereospecific to bring about bacterial cell death. When MP196 was equally effective when synthesized with all D amino acids or all L amino acids. MP196 is shown to be effective against some strains of methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). MP196 brings about bacterial cell death through a wide variety of mechanisms, thus making it difficult for the bacteria to develop resistance.

According to the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Britain was to evacuate Malta and restore the islands to the Order of St. John. The treaty also stated that at least half of Malta's garrison had to consist of 2000 Maltese soldiers led by native officers. Although the treaty was not implemented and the British did not evacuate Malta, the garrisons were readjusted, with the existing Maltese Light Infantry, Maltese Militia and Maltese Militia Coast Artillery being disbanded. The Maltese Veterans were set up in accordance with the treaty in 1803. The unit consisted of four companies with a total of 300 men. Their roles included acting as guards for government offices, military facilities and public spaces. The veterans consisted of the oldest and most experienced Maltese recruits, most of them who had been soldiers during Hospitaller rule or the French occupation. The unit was meant to provide employment for old men, while also encouraging younger men to enlist in other units so that they would be able to join the Veterans when they are older. The unit was commanded by the Marquis Pandolfo Testaferrata until 1811, when he was succeeded by Baron Pietro Paolo Testaferrata. All the officers were Maltese, with the exception of English adjutants who were transferred from British regiments. The Maltese Veterans assisted civil authorities in the efforts to contain the 1813 plague epidemic in Malta. The Maltese Veterans were amalgamated with the Maltese Provincial Battalions and the Malta Coast Artillery to form the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment on 16 February 1815.

The moment magnitude is estimated at 7, with a Mercalli intensity of XI. It severely damaged numerous towns in a vast area, completely destroying Cerreto Sannita and Guardia Sanframondi. The exact number of victims is unknown, and is estimated at about 10,000. It is among the most destructive earthquakes in the history of Italy. Earthquake The earthquake occurred in the southern and central part of the Apennines, an earthquake-prone area where several large faults are present, and where extensional tectonics phenomena are common due to the collision of the African Plate with the Eurasian Plate. The earthquake was preceded by lighter earthquakes starting in February 1688 and by a series of foreshocks in the days before the main shock. It was followed by aftershocks lasting at least until December of that year. The magnitude of the main shock is reported as 6.98 ±0.12 by the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, while the Mercalli intensity is estimated as XI (Extreme). The epicentral area was to the southeast of the Matese massif and to the northwest of Benevento, between the Calore river and one of its tributaries, the Tammaro. In this area the maximum Mercalli intensity of XI was reached, while in Naples the intensity was VII–VIII. The shock was perceived in five regions of Southern Italy, in an area of . Damage  Ruins of the old Cerreto town, completely destroyed in the earthquake. Three towns were completely destroyed by the earthquake: Cerreto Sannita, Guardia Sanframondi, and Civitella Licinio, a frazione of Cusano Mutri. In 20 more villages and towns near the epicentre, destruction was almost total. In an area of , about 120 settlements took extensive damage, while about forty–fifty other towns were damaged only slightly. Benevento was hit harshly by the earthquake, with over 80% of the buildings being significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Santa Sofia church. The poor quality of the buildings was a determining factor of extent of the damages. Avellino and Naples also experienced extensive destruction, with several collapsed or damaged buildings; in Naples, more than thirty churches and religious buildings were severely damaged. In Cerreto Sannita only three houses remained standing, with the destruction also of poor Clares monastery and a Franciscan one. Casualties The exact number of deaths resulting from the earthquake is unknown, but it is estimated at about 10,000. Cerreto Sannita, the hardest-hit town, lost half its inhabitants, 4,000 out of 8,000. In Civitella Licinio, which was completely destroyed, the only survivors were those who were working in the fields when the earthquake hit. In Guardia Sanframondi there were more than 1,000 victims. In Benevento 1,367 people died out of a population of 7,500; the number of deaths was lower because many citizens were working in the countryside at the time. Hundreds of people died in San Lorenzello, due to a landslide. Several deaths were recorded also in Naples, Avellino and other towns. Effects =Environmental effects= The earthquake caused several landslides originating from the Matese and other mountainsides, among which a large landslide that devastated the town of San Lorenzello. The courses of the Sabato and the Volturno rivers was altered. In the mountains of the Sannio, large clefts opened, new springs were formed and preexistent springs became muddy. =Societal effects= The earthquake had a strong impact on the economy and the social fabric of the affected area, which at the time belonged to the Kingdom of Naples, except for Benevento, which was an exclave of the Papal States. The inhabitants of the area abandoned the destroyed and damaged buildings, and lived in makeshift shelters. Furthermore, buildings devoted to food production like mills were also destroyed, affecting the food supply. The two governments involved granted tax relief to the people of the area and put forth other measures to mitigate the societal effects of the earthquake. Orsini, here in Papal clothes, survived the earthquake and helped rebuild Benevento. In Naples, there were episodes of looting and public security issues; the inmates of damaged prisons also escaped or were released. Three weeks after the earthquake governmental and economic activities had not restarted yet. In Benevento, the financial help provided by the Papal States was insufficient, and was mostly used to rebuild public and religious institutions. Aftermath In Benevento reconstruction was slow, and hindered by contrasts between the citizens and the Papal authorities. Another strong earthquake hit the town 14 years later, in 1702, further slowing down the efforts to rebuild the town. Vincenzo Maria Orsini, who later became Pope Benedict XIII, was archbishop of Benevento at the time. He survived the earthquake and gave a decisive contribution to rebuilding efforts. The Papal States sent experts to Benevento: they ascertained that the houses that used river pebbles had fared worse than those built with bricks. They suggested to rebuild the houses with bricks or square stones. Cerreto Sannita was rebuilt under the supervision of the Count Marzio Carafa, feudal lord of the town. The old, destroyed settlement was abandoned and rebuilt nearby at a lower altitude, in a place with safer, more stable soil. Acting under the guidance of engineers and technicians, the new town was made with larger roads, square blocks of houses, buildings with only one or two floors, and other safety measures.

According to the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Britain was to evacuate Malta and restore the islands to the Order of St. John. The treaty also stated that at least half of Malta's garrison had to consist of 2000 Maltese soldiers led by native officers. Although the treaty was not implemented and the British did not evacuate Malta, the garrisons were readjusted, with the existing Maltese Light Infantry, Maltese Militia and Maltese Militia Coast Artillery being disbanded. The Maltese Provincial Battalions were set up by Civil Commissioner Sir Alexander Ball in 1802 to take over the role of the Maltese Militia. The original plan was to have two infantry battalions of 1000 men each, but eventually two battalions of 700 men each were set up. In addition, two other corps were also raised at the same time: the Malta Coast Artillery and the Maltese Veterans. The 1st Provincial Battalion was headquartered at Fort Manoel, while the 2nd Provincial Battalion was based at Fort Ricasoli. The Provincials' roles included serving as a police force and a coast guard. At times, the men also repaired roads, fences and fortifications. According to the treaty, the battalions' officers were to be Maltese nobles appointed by the Grand Master. However, Ball himself chose two Maltese pro-British nobles, the Marquis Paolo Parisi and Conte Luigi Maria Gatto, as the commanding officers of the 1st and 2nd Battalions respectively. He did not grant them commissions so as not to violate the treaty. This move was criticized by the French, and eventually the Napoleonic Wars broke out in 1803 after multiple violations of various terms of the treaty by both the British and the French. The number of recruits in the Provincials severely depleted in 1805, when many men resigned to volunteer in the newly-established Royal Regiment of Malta. 23 men of the 2nd Provincials died in a gunpowder magazine explosion in Birgu on 18 July 1806. What remained of the two battalions were merged into a single battalion based at Fort Manoel and commanded by Parisi in October 1806. Since the men had agreed to a maximum of five years of service, there were plans to disband the Provincials. However, Ball was against this and the terms of service were renewed in 1807 and again in 1812. Parisi resigned his commission in 1811, and he was succeeded by the Conte Luigi Maria Gatto, former commander of the 2nd Battalion. By the following year, the unit was based at Cottonera. During the plague epidemic of 1813–14, the Provincial Battalion assisted the civil authorities in trying to contain the outbreak. This led to a drastic decrease in the number of new recruits, who did not want to risk getting infected themselves. The battalion's reduction and disbandment was seen as inevitable by late 1813. By 1815, the unit consisted of four companies. The Maltese Provincial Battalions were amalgamated with the Coast Artillery and the Veterans to form the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment on 16 February 1815.

He is known for his arguments on building a rational society based on “aesthetic rationality” and moving beyond the dichotomy of conservatism and liberalism, modernism and post-modernism, nationalism and globalism, and literature as an ideology to empower the masses and literature as an art free of any political context.  Life  Kim Uchang was born in Hampyeong County, South Korea in 1937. He graduated Seoul National University in 1958 with a degree in English literature, and earned his doctoral degree at Harvard University in 1975. He taught English literature at Seoul National University from 1963 to 1974 and at Korea University from 1974 to 2003. He holds an endowed chair at Ewha Womans University.  Writing  Kim Uchang’s criticisms focus on how people can reclaim their humanity in a modern capitalist society. He defines “modern era” as the age in which people lose their humanity and human rationality is suppressed, undermined, and turned into a tool, due to the separation of individual agency from the operation of society. According to Kim, quality literature can be produced when society and the individual, or universality and individuality, merges dialectically. He argues that literature can help overcome the divide or discord between society and the individual. He views literature as a bridge between the two that can restore humanity. Kim thus judges a literary work based on how successfully it brings together society and the individual. He uses the concept “specific universality” as his judging criteria and argues that specific universality can be achieved through “aesthetic rationality.” This is why Kim often emphasizes the universality of rationality. Universality derives from the ability to impartially observe life and reality. Having a universal perspective based on flexible and holistic rationality is far from making judgments mechanically. A person’s awareness of their potential for universality is what saves them from reality and connects them to it. Kim sees rationality as “the best means to perceive the marvels of the physical world or lifeworld.”Seok-ju Jang, 나는 문학이다 (Namu Iyagi, 2009).

Art Quilts Since the mid 1990s, many of Sider's quilt constructions have employed fabric processed with photographic printing. \\"The quilts are assembled from blocks of fabric on each of which a segment of the photographic image has been printed with a process called cyanotype. Imparting an image to a fabric by means of an iron stain, this process is compared to that of making blueprints. It requires that the cloth be sensitized to light in order to accept the image from a negative. What develops is a reversal of the positive-negative relationship, with elements that would normally be dark appearing light. Seeming to glow from an imperceptible light source, the images have an unsettling effect.\\" Sider's body of work references traditional quilting with the use of block forms and repetition, but also pays homage to more recent artworks by employing techniques and approaches often associated with post modern art characteristics. \\"Each block, adding to the visual complexity, contains part of an image, sometimes varying in scale from one to another rather than a whole picture. The result is an ambiguous fragmentation that keeps the eye moving to collect information. In applying photographic methods to piecework, Sider seems to have absorbed the ubiquitous influence of innovative 20th- century artists -- most notably, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol -- as well as the language of traditional quilts. Like many other artists working in the genre known as the \\"contemporary art quilt,\\" Sider mixes the visual conventions of historic quilts with present-day design approaches to two- dimensional space.\\" Art Quilt Advocacy Sandra Sider has been a proponent for increased museum acquisitions of Art Quilts. Sider states, \\"To my mind, the only way to accomplish a major change in attitudes of museum curators is to flood them with the possibility of establishing art quilts as an exciting collecting category\\" Through survey information gathered from 140 museums in the United States, Sider found that there are more than 1800 art quilts in museum collections. Some of these museums include the American Folk Art Museum, Baltimore Museum of Art, Denver Art Museum, Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Shelburne Museum, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and the Renwick Gallery - Smithsonian American Art Museum. Sandra Sider has advocated for museum curators to have better access to quantifiable information about the art quilt medium. \\"Acquisition committees can be quite demanding, and museums have limited budgets specifically reserved for various mediums. When an artist, collector, or dealer attempts to sell or donate a quilt to a museum, the acquisitions committee usually asks the curator, \\"How does this work fit into our collection? How would it fit into an exhibition or publication?\\" That curator needs to be able to come into the acquisitions meeting with solid information about other works in the same medium, and she or he hardly ever has enough time to make an exhaustive foray into the collection.\\" Sider has noted a recent trend of increasing museum acquisitions of Art Quilts. \\"My survey inquired about quilts owned by museums dated after 2000.

Radiating north and west from the junction of Union Street and North Main Street, the area was developed in the first half of the 19th century has a company town, but evolved into a mixed working-class community in the 20th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The area that is now Union Village first saw industrial activity around 1794, when one of Connecticut's first cotton mills was erected on the banks of the Hockanum River in what was then part of East Hartford. The mills grew rapidly after the Union Manufacturing Company was established in 1819, and Manchester was incorporated in 1823. By 1850 the company had built a series of worker residences along Union, Kerry, and North Streets, mainly duplexes for its laborers, but also higher-quality Greek Revival houses for its managers. The arrival of the railroad in 1849 spurred further growth, and made Union Village the economic center of the town. Further groups of worker housing were built by paper manufacturers whose mills were located nearby. The cotton mills declined due to cotton shortages in the American Civil War, and by increased efficiencies of competing larger operations elsewhere, but the paper mills continued the village's economic success, as did the Cheney Brothers silk works to the south, which were made accessible to workers living here by trolley service introduced in the 1880s. The historic district is roughly T-shaped and about in size. Its central portion consists of Union and North Streets, running north from North Main Street to Union Pond, with an extension east along Golway Street to include Robertson Park and a cluster of housing in the Edwards Street area. It also extends west along North Main Street just beyond Marble Street. There are more than 170 historic buildings, most of which are residences built between the late 18th and early 20th centuries. There are four churches, a library, and the 1914 Colonial Revival North District School.

Strzok was the Chief of the Counterespionage Section and led the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email server. Strzok rose to become a Deputy Assistant Director (one of several) of the Counterintelligence Division, the second-highest position in that division. He also led the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. In June and July 2017, Strzok worked on Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation into any links or coordination between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Russian government. Mueller removed Strzok from the Russia investigation when Mueller became aware of criticisms of Trump contained in personal text messages exchanged between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein defended Mueller's response to the text messages. The revelation of the text messages led Republican congressmen and right wing media to speculate that Strzok participated in a conspiracy to undermine the Trump presidency. A comprehensive review in February 2018 of Strzok's messages by The Wall Street Journal concluded that \\"texts critical of Mr. Trump represent a fraction of the roughly 7,000 messages, which stretch across 384 pages and show no evidence of a conspiracy against Mr. Trump\\". On August 10, 2018, David Bowdich, the FBI deputy director, fired Strzok for the anti-Trump text messages. On August 6, 2019, Strzok filed a wrongful termination suit against the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice, asking to be reinstated and awarded back pay. He asserted in the suit that his text messages were \\"protected political speech,\\" and that his termination violated the First Amendment.\\"Peter Strzok, whose anti-Trump texts got him fired from the FBI, sues for reinstatement\\", Washington Post (August 6, 2019).

In September 2020, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt published Strzok's book, Compromised: Counterintelligence and the Threat of Donald J. Trump. During an NBC News interview upon release of the book, Strzok confirmed a recent report in The New York Times that the FBI had opened a broad counterintelligence investigation into Trump after the president fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, based on concerns over Trump's \\"financial entanglements\\" with Russia. That investigation was curtailed days later by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, giving the FBI the impression that the incipient Mueller investigation would pursue it, though Rosenstein instructed Mueller not to, effectively ending the investigation.

FBI A career employee with the FBI for 22 years before his firing in August 2018, Strzok had been a lead agent in the FBI's \\"Operation Ghost Stories\\" against Andrey Bezrukov and Yelena Vavilova, a Russian spy couple who were part of the Illegals Program, a network of Russian sleeper agents who were arrested in 2010. By July 2015, Strzok was serving as the section chief of the Counterespionage Section, a subordinate section of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. Strzok led a team of a dozen investigators during the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email server and assisted in the drafting of public statements for then-FBI Director James Comey. He changed the description of Clinton's actions from \\"grossly negligent\\", which could be a criminal offense, to \\"extremely careless\\". The draft was reviewed and corrected by several people and its creation was a team process. In his statement to Congress, Comey said that \\"no reasonable prosecutor\\" would bring charges based on available evidence. Later, when additional emails were discovered a few days before the election, Strzok supported reopening the Clinton investigation. He then co-wrote the letterJames B.

According to The New York Times, Strzok was \\"considered one of the most experienced and trusted FBI counterintelligence investigators,\\" as well as \\"one of the Bureau's top experts on Russia\\" according to CNN. Strzok left the investigation in late July 2017 after the discovery of personal text messages sent to a colleague. At the request of Republicans in Congress, the Justice Department (DOJ) Inspector General (IG) began an inquiry in January 2017 into how the FBI handled investigations related to the election, and the IG announced it would issue a report by March or April 2018.Schmidt, Michael et al. \\"Mueller Removed Top Agent in Russia Inquiry Over Possible Anti-Trump Texts\\", The New York Times, December 2, 2017. The report was eventually released on June 14, 2018, after several delays. On June 15, 2018, the day after this IG report was published, Strzok was escorted from FBI headquarters as part of the bureau's internal conduct investigations. The move put Strzok on notice that the bureau intended to fire him, though he had appeal rights that could delay such action. On June 21, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that Strzok had lost his security clearance.Manchester, Julia (June 21, 2018). \\"Sessions says FBI agent Peter Strzok no longer has his security clearance.\\" The Hill. Retrieved July 14, 2018. FBI Deputy Director David L. Bowdich fired Strzok on August 10, 2018. His decision overruled the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility, whose head, Candice Will, had decided that Strzok should be demoted and suspended for 60 days. On August 13, a GoFundMe campaign was created by \\"Friends Of Special Agent Peter Strzok\\" to raise money for Strzok's lost income and ongoing legal costs. Strzok filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the DOJ and the FBI in federal court on August 6, 2019, asking to be reinstated and awarded back pay. He argued that the Justice Department had terminated him because of \\"unrelenting pressure\\" from Trump over his comments in private text messages. Strzok asserted in the suit that his sentiments were \\"protected political speech,\\" that the DOJ had violated his privacy by releasing his texts to the media, and that his termination violated the First Amendment. He alleged that the Trump administration had \\"consistently tolerated and even encouraged partisan political speech by federal employees\\", but only if that speech lauded the president and denounced his opponents. He said his removal was \\"part of a broader campaign against the very principle of free speech ... initiated and led by\\" Trump. The Justice Department and FBI spokeswomen declined to comment. Text messages The IG's investigation examined thousands of text messages exchanged using FBI-issued cell phones between Strzok and Lisa Page, with whom he was having an affair. She was also a trial attorney on Mueller's team. The texts were sent between August 15, 2015 and December 1, 2016. At the request of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the DOJ turned over 375 of these text messages to the House Judiciary Committee.Jarrett, Laura. \\"Justice Dept. offers up key witness in Russia probe as House Intel Chair threatens contempt\\", CNN, December 4, 2017. Some of the texts disparaged then- presidential candidate Donald Trump, Chelsea Clinton, Attorney General in the Obama administration Eric Holder, former Democratic Governor Martin O'Malley, and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders. Strzok called Trump an \\"idiot\\" in August 2015 and texted \\"God Hillary should win 100,000,000 - 0\\" after a Republican debate in March 2016. In their messages, Strzok and Page also advocated creating a Special Counsel to investigate the Hillary Clinton email controversy, and discussed suggesting former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald be considered for such a probe. Devlin Barrett from The Washington Post alleged Strzok and Page had been using the backdrop of discussing the Clinton investigation as a cover for their personal communications during an affair. Upon learning of the text messages, Mueller removed Strzok from the investigation. Messages released in January 2018 showed that Strzok was hesitant to join the Mueller investigation, with Page encouraging him not to. Strzok's colleagues and a former Trump administration official said that Strzok had never shown any political bias. An associate of his says the political parts of the text messages were especially related to Trump's criticism of the FBI's investigation of the Clinton emails. According to FBI guidelines, agents are allowed to have and express political opinions as individuals. Former FBI and DOJ officials told The Hill that it was not uncommon for agents like Strzok to hold political opinions and still conduct an impartial investigation. Several agents asserted that Mueller had removed Strzok to protect the integrity of the special counsel's Russia investigation. Strzok was not punished following his reassignment. Defenders of Strzok and Page in the FBI said no professional misconduct between them occurred. The decision by the DOJ to publicize the private messages in December 2017 was controversial. Statements by DOJ spokeswomen revealed that some reporters had copies of the texts even before the DOJ invited the press to review them, but the DOJ did not authorize the pre-release. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have asked for a review of the circumstances under which the texts were leaked to select press outlets. The Office of Inspector General's report on the FBI's handling of the Clinton email investigation published on June 14, 2018, criticized Strzok's text messages for creating the appearance of impropriety. However, the report concluded that there was no evidence of bias in the FBI's decision not to pursue criminal charges against Clinton. The report revealed additional texts hostile to Donald Trump by Strzok. In early August 2016, after Page asked Strzok, \\"[Trump's] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!\\", Strzok responded: \\"No. No he won't. We'll stop it.\\" Many Democrats believed that the FBI's actions during the 2016 presidential campaign, such as reopening the Clinton email investigation on the eve of the election and elements within the FBI telling The New York Times that there was no clear link between the Trump campaign and Russia, ended up harming the Clinton campaign and benefitting the Trump campaign. At a July 12, 2018 public congressional hearing, Strzok denied that the personal beliefs expressed in the text messages impacted his work for the FBI. Strzok explained that a \\"We'll stop Trump\\" text message was written late at night and off-the- cuff shortly after Trump denigrated the immigrant family of a fallen American war hero, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, and that the message reflected Strzok's belief that Americans would not vote for a candidate who engaged in such \\"horrible, disgusting behavior\\". Strzok said the message \\"was in no way – unequivocally – any suggestion that me, the FBI, would take any action whatsoever to improperly impact the electoral process for any candidate.\\" Strzok added that he knew of information during the 2016 presidential campaign that could have damaged Trump but that he never contemplated leaking it. Strzok also said that he criticized politicians such as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in his \\"blunt\\" text messages. Strzok said that the investigation into him and the Republicans' related rhetoric was misguided and played into “our enemies’ campaign to tear America apart.” =Reactions= Strzok's personal messages to Lisa Page have been used by Republicans to attack the impartiality of Mueller's investigation into Donald Trump's alleged collusion with Russia during the election. Conservative media outlets and Republicans have used the text messages as part of an aggressive campaign to discredit the Mueller investigation and protect President Trump. Other Republicans have defended Mueller and his work, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who said that he would fire Mueller only if there was actual cause under DOJ regulations, and that no such cause existed. Rosenstein also praised Mueller for removing Strzok from the Russian investigation. In 2018, President Trump falsely claimed that 19,000 text messages between Strzok and Page \\"were purposely & illegally deleted\\" and that these text messages \\"Would have explained whole Hoax\\". PolitiFact rated the claim \\"Pants-on-fire\\" false. An investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general found no evidence the messages were purposefully deleted, some from the work phones were recovered, and that the texts on their personal phones were lost when they were reset. Congressional scrutiny In an August 15, 2016 text message, Strzok told Page: \\"I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's (Andrew McCabe, Deputy Director of the FBI) office that there's no way Trump gets elected—but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.\\" This message attracted scrutiny from Republicans, including Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, who stated: \\"Some of these texts appear to go beyond merely expressing a private political opinion, and appear to cross the line into taking some official action to create an 'insurance policy' against a Trump presidency.\\" Sources close to Strzok and Page told The Wall Street Journal that Strzok was not contemplating using the FBI's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to harm Trump's candidacy, but rather emphasizing the need to aggressively pursue any such leads before the election \\"because some of Mr. Trump's associates could land administration jobs and it was important to know if they had colluded with Russia.\\" On January 20, 2018, Senator Ron Johnson (R–WI) released a letter in which he stated that the FBI's technical system had failed to preserve five months' worth of texts between Strzok and Page. According to the letter, the texts in question were sent between mid-December 2016 and mid-May 2017. A Justice Department official later said that the technical lapse had affected thousands of FBI-issued phones, which failed to store text messages for periods of up to a year. In late January 2018, a number of congressional Republicans, including Sen. Ron Johnson, asserted that they had evidence that pointed towards FBI agents working clandestinely to undermine the Trump presidency; they asserted that Strzok and Page were in a \\"secret society\\" against Trump. Congressional Republicans refused to release the evidence behind the assertion, but ABC News obtained a copy of the message that Republicans were referring to and noted that the message that refers to a \\"secret society\\" may have been made in jest. The day after his assertion that these messages demonstrated \\"corruption at the highest levels of the FBI\\" and after a copy of the messages were revealed by ABC News, Johnson walked back his comments and said that there was a \\"real possibility\\" that the messages were made in jest. In February 2018, Johnson speculated that a text message between FBI agent Peter Strzok and Lisa Page raised questions about \\"the type and extent of President Obama's personal involvement\\" in the Clinton emails investigation. Fox News reiterated, without scrutiny, Ron Johnson's speculative claim that text messages between senior FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page suggested that President Barack Obama was deeply involved in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Fox News spokeswoman Carly Shanahan did not answer an inquiry from CNN about whether Fox News reached out to Obama for comment. Johnson's claim was covered by various pro-Trump websites, such as Drudge Report, Breitbart, InfoWars and The Gateway Pundit, before President Trump himself tweeted \\"NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS!\\" Other news outlets reported that the text messages were sent in September 2016, months after the Clinton emails investigation had concluded, and three days before Obama would confront Russian President Vladimir Putin about interference in the 2016 election at the G20 Hangzhou summit. Associates of Strzok and Page told The Wall Street Journal the texts were about the FBI's investigation into Russian electoral interference. Fox News continued to report the story even after these news outlets had provided this context for the messages.  Fox News commentary  Some commentators on Fox News used Strzok's messages to comment negatively on the Mueller investigation. Jesse Watters said that Mueller's investigation now amounted to a coup against President Trump, if \\"the investigation was weaponized to destroy his presidency for partisan political purposes\\". Fox Business host Lou Dobbs said that the FBI and DOJ were working clandestinely to destroy the Trump presidency, and called for a \\"war\\" against the \\"deep state\\". One guest on Fox's talk and news show Outnumbered, Kevin Jackson, speculated that Strzok's messages were evidence of a plot by FBI agents to make \\"an assassination attempt or whatever\\" against President Trump, which other Fox hosts quickly contradicted and said was not \\"credible\\". Fox News figures referred to the investigation as \\"corrupt\\", \\"crooked\\" and \\"illegitimate\\", and likened the FBI's tactics to the KGB, the Soviet-era spy organization.  MSNBC commentary  Some MSNBC commentators described Strzok and Page's comments regarding Trump and the need for an \\"insurance policy\\" if he were elected, as merely, \\"negative comments\\", and \\"critical\\" of Trump.

He made his literary debut in 1988 when his novella Uri eoksen jumeok (우리 억센 주먹 Our Clenched Fists) appeared in the literary journal Nokdukkot. He chaired the Practicing Freedom Committee under the Writers Association of Korea and is a board member of the Association. He won the Manhae Literature Prize in 2016 for his short story collection Pyeheoreul boda (폐허를 보다 I See the Ruins).  Life  Lee In-hwi was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1958. During the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980, he was a third-year international trade student at Myongji University and was dragged off campus to be interrogated by South Korean secret service. The shock from the experience made him quit school. He served his mandatory term in the military and began fighting for workers' rights at the Guro Industrial Complex in 1984. He also started writing during this time. He made his literary debut in 1988 with the novella Uri eoksen jumeok (우리 억센 주먹 Our Clenched Fists), and continued to write novels on labor issues into the early 1990s. He founded a progressive literary journal named Salmi boineun chang (\\"window with a view of life\\") in 1997 when the Asian Financial Crisis arose. He raised funds for the journal by writing to 13 singers asking them to give a performance. All thirteen accepted his request, including the singer and social activist Jeong Tae-chun whose songs later inspired Lee's 2017 novel Geonneoganda (건너간다 Crossing). Lee stopped writing for over a decade after his novel Nalgae dalin mulgogi (날개 달린 물고기 Winged Fish) was published in 2005. He worked at a steel mill, plywood factory, and hotteok plant during his hiatus to earn a living and pay the medical bills for his wife who had been ill for seven years. His time at the factories made him realize working conditions had not improved over the years, and the experience is reflected in his 2016 short story collection Pyeheoreul boda (폐허를 보다 I See the Ruins).  Writing  Lee In-hwi primarily writes about labor issues. South Korean \\"labor literature\\" had its heyday in the 1980s. The Chun Doo-hwan administration's violent suppression of the Gwangju Uprising radicalized many South Korean intellectuals who had long opposed the country's military dictatorships. Socialism grew popular with university students and writers depicted the labor scene or envisioned a social revolution led by workers. But the national mood shifted when South Korea became a democracy after amending its constitution in 1987 and its economy began to grow. This newfound political freedom and wealth of the 1990s gave rise to a new class of consumers in the place of workers. Writers turned their attention to consumerist sentiments. Literary critic Kim Myeong-in, best known for arguing in the 1980s that literature should be an ideology to empower the masses, describes this period as follows: \\"The cultural heritage of the populace was commercialized, and what failed to be commercialized was disposed of.\\"Myeong-in Kim, “다시 문학을 부른다,” Literature and Practice, Fall 2007 Issue. Lee was one of the few South Korean writers who continued to write about the populace and labor issues into the 1990s, believing that “South Korean society and the labor scene had not inherently changed,” as literary critic Jin Jeong-seok puts it.Jeong-seok Jin, “1990년대와 탈이념시대의 문학,” in 새 민족문학사 강좌 2 (Changbi, 2009), 420. Lee’s Hwalhwasan (활화산 Active Volcano) (1990) portrays the living conditions of miners, Munbakkeui saramdeul (문밖의 사람들 People Outside the Door) (1992) talks about workers in the aftermath of a nationwide strike from July to August 1987, and Geu achimeun dasi oji anneunda (그 아침은 다시 오지 않는다 That Morning Won’t Come Again) (1993) addresses workers’ and women’s rights. His works, along with other labor literature, remained on the periphery of the South Korean literary scene in the 1990s. Lee took an 11-year hiatus after publishing Nalgae dalin mulgogi (날개 달린 물고기 Winged Fish) in 2005. The novel fictionalizes the story of Lee Yong-seok, a contractor hired by the Korea Workers’ Compensation & Welfare Service who burned himself to death in October 2003. Lee made his comeback in 2016, publishing a collection of short stories and novellas entitled Pyeheoreul boda (폐허를 보다 I See the Ruins). The book describes the lives of underpaid, overworked laborers who are still “treated as old machine parts that can easily be replaced instead of being respected for their skills,” thirty years after the labor movement of the 1980s. Lee’s novel Geonneoganda (건너간다 Crossing) (2017) is about the life and work of Jeong Tae-chun who “sang the hopes of the people at every turn of history, from the authoritarian Park Chung Hee government in the 70s and Gwangju Uprising in the 80s through the June Struggle of 1987 to today’s candlelight rallies.”  Works  * 활화산 (Active Volcano; 1990) * 문 밖의 사람들 (People Outside the Door; 1992) * 그 아침은 다시 오지 않는다 (That Morning Won’t Come Again; 1993) * 내 생의 적들 (The Enemies in My Life; 2004) * 날개 달린 물고기 (Winged Fish; 2005) * 폐허를 보다 (I See the Ruins; 2016) * 건너간다 (Crossing; 2017)  Awards  * 2016: Manhae Literature Prize  References  Living people 1958 births South Korean writers Myongji University alumni ","title":"Lee In-hwi"},{"id":"55958333","text":"Kalara Santhe is a 2009 Indian Kannada-language action drama film directed by Sumana Kittur.

She was also known as Elizabeth Jones, Elizabeth Jones Carey and Kecheahgahmequa. Portrait of Eliza Field, made in 1832 by London painter Matilda Jones. Biography The daughter of Charles Field, a soap and candle manufacturer, and Elizabeth Carter, she was born in Lambeth and attended a boarding school in Surrey. When her mother died in 1820, she returned home to look after her younger brothers and sisters. In 1831, she met Peter Jones, an Ojibwa Methodist minister from Canada who was raising funds to support his missionary work; they married in New York City in 1833 despite opposition by her parents and many of her friends. They settled in a cabin on the Credit River Indian Reserve. She was frequently ill and suffered two miscarriages and two still births. However, she taught the children about Christianity and taught the young girls how to sew. She visited England in 1837–38 with her niece Nahnebahwequa and, when she returned, gave birth to a son. From 1841 to 1849, they worked at the Muncey mission near London in Canada West. Her husband's was frequently ill during this period. In 1851, they moved to a house in Brantford; her husband died five years later. In 1858, she married John Carey, a farmer from New York. It was not a happy marriage and she appears to have separated from Carey several years later. She taught painting in Brantford and continued to write for a time. Around 1880, she lost her sight. In 1838, she published Memoir of Elizabeth Jones, a little Indian girl, an account of the life of her niece. In 1854, she received a prize for her miniature watercolours at the Upper Canada Provincial Exhibition. She arranged for the publication of Peter's diaries as Life and journals in 1860 and of hisHistory of the Ojebway Indians in 1861. Field also added her own drawings to History.

O.) Beachcroft (9 March 1902 – 11 December 1988) was born in Clifton, Bristol. His father, Richard, was a schoolmaster.1911 England, Wales & Scotland Census Beachcroft graduated Balliol College, Oxford and moved to London, where he first went to work as a copywriter with the Paul E. Derrick Advertising Agency. He married Marjorie Taylor in 1926 and they had one daughter, Nina, who later became a writer of children's fantasy novels. Beachcroft began by writing poetry, which he shared with T. S. Eliot, who found them \\"very skillful ... but candidly I do not see what can be done with them at the moment.\\". He wrote several critical essays that Eliot published in The Criterion in the early 1930s, then began concentrating on short stories, which he often wrote while riding London buses to and from his work at the Unilever Advertising Service. His first collection, A Young Man in a Hurry and Other Stories, was published in 1934. It included the story, \\"Iodide in Hut C,\\" which New York Times reviewer Eda Lou Walton called \\"one of the most skillfully plotted stories I have read\\" and William Rose Benét rated as \\"one that Rudyard Kipling would have been proud to sign in the days when his fame was in the making.\\" His second collection, You Must Break Out Sometimes and Other Stories, published in 1936, was his most critically acclaimed. Writing in The Spectator, Graham Greene estimated that \\"Mr. Beachcroft is likely to become, after Mr. H. E. Bates, the most distinguished short-story writer in this country,\\" and in The New Masses, T. C. Wilson called Beachcroft \\"one of the ablest of the younger English writers.\\". In New York Times, reviewer Eda Lou Walton wrote that \\"One wishes Mr. Beachcroft would write a novel, for these tales promise a work on a far larger scale.\\" His first novel, The Man Who Started Clean, which told the story of a young man who had to recover his identity after a traumatic head injury in an automobile accident was published in 1937, the reviews were only mildly positive. In The Spectator, Kate O'Brien wrote that \\"It is all very carefully written—and nothing is missed or left out except that imaginative drive or passion which might have made a magnificent problem out of what is in fact only a neat piece of invention,\\" and The New York Times reviewer assessed that Beachcroft had created \\"[T]he skeleton for an excellent (if unusual) novel, but a novel, like a man, requires more than a skeleton, and the book as a whole is disappointing.\\" O'Brien also gave his third short story collection, The Parents Left Alone (1940) a mixed review, writing that while his prose \\"... is lucid and restrained,\\" it also \\"makes one marvel at his failure to criticise and blue-pencil his work.\\" Beachcroft took a break from fiction to work as Chief Overseas Publicity Officer for the BBC, where he wrote a series of talks collected in Calling All Nations (1942). The Bodley Head published a selection of stories from his first three collections as Collected Stories of T. O. Beachcroft in 1946, and he continued to work in the genre after that. Of his 1947 collection, Malice Bites Back, Stevie Smith wrote, \\"Simplicity is the word for Mr. Beachcroft's stories, but it is a poet's simplicity, the most subtle in the world.\\" In 1949, he began working for the British Council as general editor of their series, \\"Writers and Their Work.\\" Ten years after leaving this position, he wrote a two-volume book for the series, The English Short Story (1964).

Dixon, first published in 1976, which applies insights from psychology to military history. After case studies of military and naval disasters from the preceding 120 years, mostly British, it offers in readable, not technical, style an analysis of the personality of the unsuccessful leader. Its conclusions are equally applicable to other less deadly forms of human organisation. Synopsis Starting from the premise that success or failure in military and naval operations may in large part be due to the personality of the general or admiral in command, the author first examines various historical disasters and the role of the commander in the resulting loss of life or liberty for the victims (which often included civilians as well). Among major British case studies, he cites the blunders in the Crimean War by Raglan, followed by the blunders of Buller in the Second Boer War. In the First World War, he looks at the casualty list of Haig on the Western Front and the ineptitude of Townshend in Mesopotamia. Between the wars he castigates Britain for its failure to modernise its forces, which led to years of disaster on land, sea and (less so) in the air. During the Second World War, he covers Percival's failure to defend Singapore and Montgomery's over-bold effort to seize Arnhem (though he sees this as a tragic blot on an otherwise laudable career). After this catalogue of incompetence, he addresses how such large and costly enterprises as armed forces can be put in the hands of men of such dubious calibre. Here he discerns a vicious circle: it is people of a certain type who are recruited and promoted, so others either do not apply or languish in insignificant positions. Among characteristics of the British officer class in the period under examination are: a narrow social segment admitted, scorn of intellectual and artistic endeavour, subservience to tradition, and emphasis on virility. This leads, in his view, to the prevalence of an authoritarian type, fawning to superiors and often harsh or uncaring to inferiors. Such a man, by this analysis, is afraid of women (so only half human) and afraid of failure. He therefore ignores people and facts which do not conform to his world view, learns little from experience and clings to external rules, applying them even when the situation demands other approaches (for example Haig sacrificing hundreds of thousands of men he ordered to walk through mud into German machine gun fire). He may not be stupid, though some of the generals studied undoubtedly were, and he may be physically courageous, but his fatal lack is moral courage. Men like Townshend and Percival, caught in a trap by a more enterprising enemy, sat zombie-like until disaster overwhelmed them. As a corrective, the author also mentions unequivocally great military and naval commanders like Napoleon, Wellington and Nelson who were far from this personality type. Publication Reception Even though some of the psychology theory may have dated, the work has attracted favourable reviews for over 40 years and is still considered a valuable text in studies of leadership.

Fayziev clarified that, according to the plot, people evolved and became part of a galactic society fighting creatures that look like \\"super- reactive turboballs\\", so battles with them will look like football, hence the name of the film. The nickname of the superhero is Yashin. The director's chair was occupied by Dzhanik Fayziev's company Bonanza Studio, who counts at least three kinohit The Turkish Gambit (2005 film) and Furious (2017 film), the historical fantasy film. Fayziev has been nurturing the idea of this project for many years: Cosmoball is rooted in the dream of wonderful future worlds and was inspired by the world's fiction classics. He is also the co- producer and co-author of the script. Producing the tape entrusted Sergey Selyanov (ru), the preliminary development of the project took almost 5 years, so the script, the appearance of the characters and the world around them, graphics and scenery were worked out especially carefully.

In August 2020, Konstantin Ernst, General Director of Channel One, noted that the holdings decided to unite and put an excellent picture forward in order to support it with all the efforts of the industry. «Often good films receive less attention, not because they do not correspond to their quality, but simply under-formatted them», said Ernst. In his opinion, on the eve of the Day of Russian Cinema, it is symbolic that the film, which is certainly a powerful domestic blockbuster for all types of audience, is presented in Russia with the support of large media holdings. Anton Zlatopolskiy (ru), General Director of Russia-1, noted that the standard situation for the industry was the independent promotion of their products by the holdings. However, in the current situation, competition fades into the background. According to Vyacheslav Murugov (ru), head of STS Media, the support of the holdings will provide a cumulative effect in this composition. =Casting= The main roles in the film performed by the actor Yevgeny Romantsov as a Russian athlete were cast for the main characters. Romantsov graduated from the Moscow State Academy of Physical Culture (majoring in theory and methodology of football and hockey), and this experience helped him enter the character of a sports player. Romantsov took part in productions of the Gogol Center. Next to him was the Russian actress Victoria Agalakova (née Glukhikh) studied ballet, acrobatics and choreography, which was very useful to her while filming dynamic scenes on suspensions. Agalakova works as a theater at the Saint Petersburg State Theater of Musical Comedy. They were accompanied by аctress Maria Lisovaya, a graduate of the Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute. The fourth unknown actress who joined them was the winner of international competitions in rhythmic gymnastics Yelizaveta \\"Liza\\" Taychenacheva, an actress who previously competed in biathlon and the Children's teams of Youth Sports Schools \\"Youth of Moscow\\". They were all cast because of their sporting past. They were joined by famous actors such as Yevgeny Mironov, Elena Yakovleva, Mikhail Yefremov and others. Dzhanik Fayziev director is the most ambitious, expensive and high-tech project of all that is being shot in Russia. On the walls of the pavilion there is a blue chroma key on which backgrounds will be drawn. In one frame with live actors - virtual characters, drawn from scratch or with the help of digital capture technology acting game motion capture. = Filming = Principal photography commenced in the scenery on the territory of Mosfilm Studios in Moscow, and lasted from June 2 to mid-September 2017. Palms, figs, creepers and crumbling facades of Moscow, dusty cars, rusty phone booth on the corner. Beside it, wrapped in colorful rags hairy merchant-a southerner. In a battered suitcase laid out the goods: a few seedy lanterns, the old clock, the bubbles with strange drugs. All this can be seen in the pavilion No. 1 of \\"Mosfilm\\", where is now built the districts of Moscow. After a global catastrophe, the world's climate has changed, many of the countries went under water, thousands of settlers poured into Moscow, which was in the tropical zone. No jams, no grey down jackets or sullen individuals — the post-apocalyptic city looks nicer and modern. On an area of over 3,500 square meters built transforming the scenery of the streets and interiors of post-apocalyptic Moscow, with thousands of props created by the artists specifically for the film. In the shooting involved up to 500 actors for crowd scenes, and for each stitched a unique costume. In the Studio, costume designers were delivered 1.5 tons of items lightweight summer clothing from India were delivered. When working with images we use sophisticated prosthetics: the creation of one of the characters, Shaft, takes the artists on makeup for seven hours, the suit of silicone pads cover her whole body. =Music= The music for this new Russian science fiction was composed by foreign composer Tony Neiman. = Post-production = For the post-production of visual effects is engaged in the studio Main Road Post, according to the company's general director Arman Yakhin. One of the biggest challenges of the project is an incredible number of digital characters (over 50), both completely virtual and recreated using digital capture technology for actors. For this work, the walls of the Mosfilm pavilions were covered with blue chroma key, on which the backgrounds will be painted. In the first case, the actor on the court interacts with the dimensional toy, in the second - with the actor in a blue suit with inertial sensors. Thanks to the technology of augmented reality, the director can see on his monitor immediately a full-fledged image, that is, instead of a blue person - an alien. Complement the work on creating a unique world of the picture specialists in visual effects from the studio of visual effects Main Road Post.

Immediately after the first shot, the gang scored 12 robberies at toll booths in about 2 months. In October 1987 they organized an extortion attempt against a Rimini resident, Savino Grossi. The Savi sent a letter to Grossi indicating the procedure for payment. The dealer pretended to give in to blackmail but had already warned the police station in Rimini. On 3 October Savino Grossi went on the highway with his car, hiding a police officer in his luggage rack, while other cars from the Rimini police station followed him a short distance away.

In via Casini the gang's car was overtaken by the patrol and the maneuver was interpreted by the criminals as an attempt to register the plate number and it was decided to liquidate the carabinieri.

Critics such as Ed Masley have noted that the band's musical style is difficult to classify, as it includes elements of rock 'n' roll, Americana, and rockabilly. Although they have won awards as a country music band, their sound is very different from conventional American 21st-century country music; instead, it sounds more similar to the music of Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash. History The Cowslingers were formed in 1991 when the band's singer, Greg Miller, was accepted into Kent State University. They released their debut EP, Bad Booze Rodeo, in 1993 on Drink 'n' Drive Records, on which they also released their debut album, Off the Wagon, in 1994. Their second album, That's Truckdriving, was released later the same year. The band then became highly active touring throughout Ohio, which led to them starting to tour on the East and West Coast. Miller subsequently asked his brother, Ken Miller, to become the band's new bassist. The band released their third studio album, A Fistful of Pesetas, on the Spanish label Rock & Roll Inc. in 1996. In 1997, the band released the album West Virginia Dog Track Boogie on Shake It Records, followed by Americana a Go Go in 1999. Also in 1999, the Cleveland Free Times named the band Best Country Act; the same paper named them the Best Punk/Hardcore Act in 2000.

She is often known in Egypt as \\"Negmet El gamaheer\\" (the star of masses) because of the high commercial success of her movies in the 1990s. Through her still on-going 6-decades career, she has appeared in 61 movies and 7 TV shows. She is most recognized for her femme fatale roles and spy movies related to Egyptian-Israeli conflict and patriotic issues after 1952 revolution, such as El Gasousa Hekmat Fahmy (1994), Mohemma Fi Tel Aviv (1992). Also, she is known for various crime movies, ranging from vulgar drug dealer in Egyptian suburbs to a professional thief.  Career  = 1958–1980 = Started her work in cinema after winning in a beauty contest in Cairo which gained her debut 1958 in a small role in Youssef Chahine's historical movie about the French Colonisim in North Africa, Gamila. In the sixties, she had many various small roles. In early 1970s played the role of Zaghaga, a local drug dealer, in TV soap opera al-Dawwama (The Whirlpool), besides Mahmoud Yassin and then-young Mahmoud Abdel Aziz, the series was very popular and was produced for theaters. In 1974 she earned more recognition when she produced her own movie, Bamba Kashar, in which she played the role of the real 20th belly dancer of the same name, it was directed by Hassan El Imam as quite similar to his typical melodrama characteristics, also contained many songs and dances performed by El Gendy, the movies starred her then-husband, Emad Hamdy, and notably despite the screening permits faced longtime problems, it had had very wide success in theaters for many weeks. From 1980 to 1984, she starred in different commercially successful movies and some of them were well-received by many critics, such as the role of Neama't Allah in Wekalet El Balah, which is scripted by Nobel prize laureate Naguib Mahfouz, which she appeared as a very strong boss in old rural part in old Cairo and has her own warehouse, but she falls in love with a newly appointed worker and then marries him, which gives glimpses of the struggle between her rigor personality and the weakness resulted and affected by love, leading the character to explore ecstasy, jealousy and revenge. In El-Batneyya, named after another popular Egyptian area, she's starred beside prominent actors including Farid Shawki, Ahmed Zaki and Farouk El Feshawi. = 1990s = Nadia El Gendy has collaborated with director Nader Galal in nine movies starting with Jabarowt Emraa (A Woman's Might) in 1984 and ending with Amn Dawla in 1999, El Gendy appeared as an intelligent agent (or double agent) in most of the works, or roles with significant femme fatale characteristics, also many were low-budget. In A'sr El Quwwa (Age of Power), played a different role she hasn't done before, as she was an aspiring recently-graduated lawyer and daughter of a billionaire who is involved along with his family in many crime and illegal activities, the movie is significantly influenced by The Godfather trilogy. = 2000s–2010s = The last film she has appeared in is Aly Badrakhan's Al-raghba in 2001, beside Ilham Shaheen and Yaser Galal in, a film loosely based on A Streetcar Named Desire. Since then, she has only participated in four soap operas but in leading roles: Zeinat, Man Atlak al- nar A'la Hend Allam? (Who shot Hend Allam?), Maleka fi el-Manfa (Queen in Exile), and Asrar (Secrets). In September 2018, El Gendy announced on her official Instagram account that she will star in a new spy role after nearly two decades of the last similar role she had done.

She was the central figure of a cause célèbre kidnapping when she was abducted by a nobleman from the theatre in 1765, which became a great scandal at the time. She was the daughter of the actor Christopher Pauli Rose (1723-1784) and Gertrud Christensdatter (1722-1775). She made her stage debut as Mélite in Den gifte Filosof at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen in 1761. During this time period, the profession of acting was compared to that of a prostitute, and after her performance as Bélise in the French comedy Vulcani Kjæp, Mette Marie Rose was abducted by Count Christian Conrad Danneskiold-Laurvig, while the friends of the count diverted her father's attention and then told him that his daughter had been taken by the count to his palace in Copenhagen. The case attracted great attention and became a scandal. Her father reported the kidnap to the king, and because Mette Marie Rose was employed at the Royal Danish Theatre and therefore formally an employee at the king's household, the king accused the count of having offended his royal authority. Christian Conrad Danneskiold-Laurvig was forced to release Rose and was sentenced to fines and exile in Norway (where he was later involved in the elopement of Ingeborg Akeleye). This was an unusual case when a nobleman was judged guilty for a crime against a commoner. However, there are indications that Mette Marie Rose and her mother had been aware of the kidnap beforehand and consented to it. Rose lost her position at the theater, was given a pension and a dowry and sent to a vicarage in the countryside to be educated in moral discipline. In 1774, she returned to Copenhagen and married Niels Schiørring (1743-1798), a musician at the royal chapel.

They have been successfully used in wing-design optimization, robotic learning , and have more recently been extended to human-in-the-loop systems, such as aerospace and transportation. They include both model-based methods, where a generative model is available or can be learned, in addition to model-free methods, that include regression-based approaches, such as stacked-regression. The approach used depends on the domain and properties of the data available, and is similar to the concept of metasynthesis, proposed by Judea Pearl.  Data fidelity spectrum  Example of data-fidelity spectrum with benefits and limitations. The fidelity of data can vary along a spectrum between low- and high-fidelity. The next sections provide examples of data across the fidelity spectrum, while defining the benefits and limitations of each type of data. =Low fidelity data (LoFi)= Low-fidelity data (LoFi) includes any data that was produced by a person or Stochastic Process that deviates from the real-world system of interest. For example, LoFi data can be produced by models of a physical system that use approximations to simulate the system, rather than modeling the system in an exhaustive manner. Moreover, in human-in-the-loop (HITL) situations the goal may be to predict the impact of technology on expert behavior within the real- world operational context. Machine learning can be used to train statistical models that predict expert behavior, provided that an adequate amount of high- fidelity (i.e., real-world) data are available or can be produced.  LoFi benefits and limitations  In situations when there is not an adequate amount of high-fidelity data available to train the model, low-fidelity data can sometimes be used. For example, low-fidelity data can be acquired by using a distributed simulation platform, such as X-Plane, and requiring novice participants to operate in scenarios that are approximations of the real-world context. The benefit of using low-fidelity data is that they are relatively inexpensive to acquire, so it is possible to elicit larger amounts of data. However, the limitation is that the low-fidelity data may not be useful for predicting real-world expert (i.e., high-fidelity) performance due to differences between the low-fidelity simulation platform and the real-world context, or between novice and expert performance (e.g., due to training). =High-fidelity data (HiFi) = High-fidelity data (HiFi) includes data that was produced by a person or Stochastic Process that closely matches the operational context of interest. For example, in wing design optimization, high-fidelity data uses physical models in simulation that produce results that closely match the wing in a similar real-world setting. In HITL situations, HiFi data would be produced from an operational expert acting in the technological and situational context of interest.  HiFi benefits and limitations  An obvious benefit of utilizing high-fidelity data is that the estimates produced by the model should generalize well to the real-world context. However, these data are expensive in terms of both time and money, which limits the amount of data that can be obtained. The limited amount of data available can significantly impair the ability of the model to produce valid estimates. =Multifidelity methods (MfM)= Multifidelity methods attempt to leverage the strengths of each data source, while overcoming the limitations. Although small to medium differences between low- and high- fidelity data are sometimes able to be overcome by multifidelity models, large differences (e.g., in KL divergence between novice and expert action distributions) can be problematic leading to decreased predictive performance when compared to models that exclusively relied on high-fidelity data. Multifidelity models enable low-fidelity data to be collected on different technology concepts to evaluate the risk associated with each concept before actually deploying the system.

His physiological research focuses on adaptations of marine mammals for deep, prolonged diving. Davis has continually emphasized the importance of studying aquatic animals in their natural environment and has spent many years developing animal-borne instruments that record video and monitor three-dimensional movements, swimming performance and environmental variables to better understand their behavior and ecology. His academic endeavors and 94 research expeditions have taken him to 64 countries and territories on seven continents and all of the world's oceans.  Education and early career  Randall Davis is the oldest son of Charles Davis and Beverly Sheldon who met and married in Los Angeles after the Second World War. His father, who was from Iola, Kansas, moved to Southern California in the 1930s, and his mother was a native of Los Angeles. In 1958, at the age of five, Davis moved from Los Angeles to the nearby San Gabriel Valley. During his early childhood, he developed an interest in marine biology and diving. He kept marine aquaria, collected his own specimens of vertebrates and invertebrates, and obtained his SCUBA certification at age 15. He was the Salutatorian in his graduating Nogales High School class in 1970 and was inducted into the California Scholarship Federation. Davis attended the University of California at Riverside as a pre-medical student, but spent his third year in the Department of Physiology at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland as part of the UC Education Abroad Program. It was there that he developed his keen interest in physiology, but he also traveled across Europe and had cultural experiences that motivated him to also study art history, comparative literature, music appreciation and medieval philosophy. He graduated from the University of California with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology in 1974 and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society because of his simultaneous interest in the Liberal Arts. Davis married Ana Maria Melgoza in 1974, and the two of them returned to St. Andrews where he continued his studies in the Department of Physiology. After one year, Davis was accepted into the Physiology and Pharmacology Doctoral Program in the School of Medicine at the University of California at San Diego. His first graduate advisor was Dr. John B. West, the high-altitude respiratory physiologist. In early 1976, Davis conducted an internship with Dr. Gerald Kooyman, a comparative physiologist working at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Kooyman was studying the diving physiology of harbor seals and had recently developed the first animal-borne time-depth recorders (TDRs) to study the diving behavior of free-ranging marine mammals. Davis decided to study the physiology of marine mammals and became Kooyman's Doctoral student in 1976. He spent that summer attaching TDRs to northern fur seals on the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea, then sailed on the National Science Foundation's research vessel Hero to South Georgia Island in the Southern Ocean to study the diving behavior of Antarctic fur seals.Kooyman GL and Davis RW. (1986) Diving behavior of Antarctic fur seals. In: Fur Seals: Maternal Strategies on Land and at Sea. (RL Gentry and GL Kooyman, eds).

World and I Magazine. 6(3):314-319 Davis has been featured in or helped to produce six educational films on marine mammals, one of which received first place in the Jack Ward Competition for Non-Commercial Films.  Research  Davis participated in the first deployments of mechanical and microprocessor time- depth recorders (TDRs) on pinnipeds and penguins in the mid-to-late 1970s. The 1980s saw the advent of more sophisticated microprocessor-based archival and satellite-monitored tags and, by 1986, thousands of dives had been recorded on many species of marine mammals, penguins and reptiles.Le Boeuf BJ, Costa DP, Huntley AC, Kooyman GL, Davis RW. (1986) Pattern and depth of dives in northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris. Journal of Zoology, London. 208:1-7 However, time-depth profiles did not provide information on what the animals were doing at depth, so any behavioral interpretations were speculative. This led Davis to partner with an electronics engineer (William Hagey) to begin developing instruments that would eventually record video as well as depth, swim speed, magnetic bearing, pitch and roll, flipper/fluke stroking, GPS location at the surface and environmental variables such as conductivity (salinity), temperature and dissolved oxygen. The first instrument they deployed in 1987 on a Weddell seal in Antarctica was a Sony camcorder in a plastic housing.Davis RW, Wartzok D, Elsner R, Stone H.

During the past three decades, Davis and Hagey have developed five generations of video and data recorders that have been deployed on seals, whales, sea turtles and sharks. Each generation was smaller, had more sensors and could record video and data over longer periods of time. With these instruments, researchers can now classify and distinguish the behavioral functions of different dive types and describe foraging strategies and hunting tactics in detail.Davis RW, Fuiman L, Williams TM, Le Boeuf BJ.

Deep Sea Research Part II 88:65-77 This work continues to be a major focus of Davis' research. Davis and his graduate students have spent over four decades studying the morphological, physiological and metabolic adaptations of marine mammals for deep, prolonged diving. Davis' research has shown that the dive response (a fundamental adaptation for breath-hold diving) is more complex than earlier recognized. Although the dive response is a primitive cardiovascular response to protect animals from asphyxia, Davis showed that it has been integrated with the equally primitive exercise (fight-or-flight) response to regulate blood flow in a manner that maintains aerobic metabolism at different levels of submerged exercise.Davis RW and Kanatous SB.

Journal of Comparative Physiology B 184:23-53 A third area of Davis’ research has focused on the thermoregulatory physiology of sea otters and the harmful effects of oil exposure. In the 1980s, Davis and his colleague Dr. Terrie Williams conducted research for the U.S, Department of the Interior that developed techniques to mitigate the effects of oil on sea otters and other fur bearing marine mammals. In the 1980s, the primary concern of the U.S. Department of the Interior had been the potential devastation of the small California sea otter population by an oil tanker spill. However, it was during the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska that their science-based techniques to clean and rehabilitate otters were first used when Davis was asked by the U.S, Department of the Interior to direct the Sea Otter Rehabilitation Program.Browne M (1990) New York Times, Science Section, Oiled sea otter rehabilitation project https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/02/science/492190.html?pagewanted=all This effort, involving over 300 people, rehabilitated and released 225 oiled sea otters, the largest number ever held in captivity. Davis then co-authored a book on the methods for rehabilitating oiled sea otters, and this is still the standard among rehabilitation programs for fur bearing marine mammals. This book and other information on sea otters is available to the public online: www.wildliferesearch.com. In addition to the effects of oil on sea otters, Davis has studied the behavioral ecology of sea otters in Prince William Sound, Alaska since 2001. This long-term study has included foraging behavior and prey preference,Wolt R, Gelwick FP, Weltz F, Davis RW.

It is an example of the Belarusian Gothic and one of the first fortified churches in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania along with the Church of St. Michael in Synkavichy.  History  Muravanka church on a painting by Vyacheslav Gryaznov (1874) The church in Muravanka arose in the first half of the 16th century. Church inspections made by the archeologists showed that it was probably built between years 1524 and 1542. The church was severely damaged in 1656 during the war against Russia and in 1706 during the Great Northern War. Then it was empty for many years and restored only in the middle of the 19th century. During World War I the German army used the space of the church as a warehouse for provisions. In the Interwar Poland it was turned into the Roman Catholic church. In 1990 the church was returned by the Soviet government to the Orthodox believers and has been in use since then.  Architecture  The church in Muravanka is one the finest examples of the fortified temple architecture of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It has both traits of Gothic and Renaissance architecture. The building is close to a square and sized 15x13.5 meters. There is a round tower on each of the corners. Diameter of the towers is about 4.5 meters and thickness of their walls is about 1.8 meters. On the eastern side of the church an apse is attached. The facades are covered with numerous ornament elements. The church has one entrance located on its western end. The columns support the vaults and the interior is split into the three naves about 12 meters each in height. In spite of war damages and multiple restoration procedures, the outer look of the building is still close to the original project. Now it is protected by the law of the Republic of Belarus as a building that have nationwide cultural and historical value.

BAM Complex consists of five components; BamB, BamC, BamD, BamE (all are lipoproteins) and BamA (Outer membrane protein). This complex is responsible in catalyzing folding and insertion of β-barrel proteins into the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. β-barrel membrane proteins can only be found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and in organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts which were evolved from bacteria. In Gram-negative bacteria, outer membrane proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and then exported into the periplasm by Sec translocon machinery. Then they are escorted to the inner surface of the outer membrane by molecular chaperons. Finally those nascent proteins interact with BAM Complex and insert into the outer membrane as β-barrel proteins.  Structure and function  According to the fully resolved BamA structure of N. gonorrhoeae, BamA has a large periplasmic domain connected to a transmembrane β-barrel domain which is made of 16 antiparallel β strands. There are five polypeptide translocation-associated (POTRA) domains extending from the barrel at the periplasmic domain of BamA. Current studies suggest that the four lipoproteins in the BAM Complex (BamB, BamC, BamD, BamE ) assemble on to the POTRA domains of BamA, making it the vital component of BAM Complex. The first and the last or 16th β-strands associate in closing the barrel. Extracellular loops (eL) eL4, eL6 and eL7 of the barrel forms a dome over the barrel by isolating the interior of the barrel from the extracellular space and interior of the BamA barrel is completely empty. The external rim of the β-barrel has a narrow, reduced hydrophobic surface and it reduces lipid order and thickness of the membrane around the barrel. Transient separation of 1st and 16th β-strands which are associated in closing the barrel causes lateral opening of the barrel making a route from interior cavity of the BamA into the outer membrane. POTRA 5 domain of BamA sits close to the β–barrel and interacts with periplasmic loops (pL) pL3, pL4, pL5, pL7 and stabilize the closed conformation of the barrel. Swing movements of POTRA 5 domain and having no interactions with pLs make the opening of the barrel. Thus POTRA domains act as a gate to regulate the access into the interior of β–barrel. Hence there are three structural features associate with BamA that regulates the entry of β-barrel proteins into the outer membrane. First, open and closed conformation of BamA β-barrel. Second, the narrow and reduced hydrophobic rim on the surface of the β –barrel causes local destabilization of the outer membrane. Third, ability to undergo lateral opening of the barrel by transient separation of 1st and 16th β–barrel strands.

She attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She worked part-time at the University Hospital while finishing her master's degree in English. Cowan started her research as a result of how horrified she was by the false advertising of the morning after pill.The Speculum of Ignorance: The Women's Health Movement and Epistemologies of Ignorance, Nancy Tuana, Hypatia, Vol. 21, No. 3, Feminist Epistemologies of Ignorance (Summer, 2006), pp. 1-19 She was invited to present her research findings at the Senate hearing on DES in 1974. This made her the first women's health activist to ever testify as an expert witness.  Early research and activism  In 1969, when Cowan was working at the University Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, she began researching the effects of diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was also known as the \\"morning after\\" pill. The goal of her research was to look into the side effects that were caused by this drug. Many scientific articles that wrote about DES claimed that it was completely safe and effective. Even studies done by the University Hospital showed that none of the thousands of women surveyed reported side effects. However, Cowan had heard from her friends that the pill caused severe nausea for a short period of time and some cases of pregnancy that lead to children with cancer. Knowing this, Cowan brought together a group of women former patients at the University of Michigan's student health center and organized Advocates for Medical Information. This group aimed to educate women in the side effects of the DES pill and to oppose the use of it at the University Hospital and other health centers in the country. In 1971, the organization received a grant from the student government to undertake a survey of women who had taken DES. Out of the sixty-nine women who responded, only a quarter of them were contacted by doctors after taking the medication. This proved that the advertisements for the drug DES was fraudulent. After concluding her research about the horrific side effects of diethylstilbestrol (DES), Cowan believed that women around the country should know about the fraudulent drug. She contacted Ralph Nader and other feminists to prepare for a press conference in Washington D.C. in December 1972. Immediately after her press conference, the dangers of DES made it into national news.  Accomplishments  In 1974, Belita Cowan, Barbara Seaman, Phyllis Chesler, Mary Howell, and Alice Wolfson established the National Women's Health Network. This was a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C. that aimed to give women a louder voice in the healthcare system.Network News: The Newsletter of the National Women's Health Network, Volumes 5-8, 1980. Later in 1974, she was invited to present her research findings at the House and Senate hearings on DES. This made her the first women's health activist to ever testify as an expert witness. In 1978, she became the National Women's Health Network's first Executive Director. In her time in this position, she brought the NWHN into many important health issues including taking legal action against the manufacturers of the Dalkon Shield for their product injuring many women, challenging the Hyde Amendment, and sponsoring the first national conference on Black Women's Health. In 1983, Cowan retired as Executive Director of NWHN. In 1989, she founded and became president of the Lymphoma Foundation of America, which is devoted to helping lymphoma patients and families as well as funding research to find a cure.  Feminist writings  In 1972, Cowan created \\"Her-self\\", which was a feminist newspaper dedicated to women's health. In 1975, she wrote an excerpt in a women's newsjournal called \\"Off Our Backs\\"Belita Cowan, Off Our Backs, Vol. 5, No. 6, July 1975, p. 35 Here, she addressed the fact that men were controlling women's health and pass laws that effect all women without any input from them. In the past, the FDA has held countless hearings on IUDs, hormone pills, drugs taken during pregnancy, vaginal deodorants, and other over-the-counter pills. These hearings are run by men, attended by men, and men make laws from these hearings. Cowan asks, “Where are the women?”. She wants women who use these products, women doctors, and women's health advocates to come together and make their voices heard. Cowan points out that action can be taken in small steps too.

It takes us into the lived experience of the Nigerian Civil War through the eyes of Arese Carrington as a young girl and then the struggle for democracy during the tyrannical military dictatorship as a young woman. A mantra her father gave her during the Nigerian civil war when their family was torn apart has continued to shape her life choices and belief in social justice. This memoir opens up to the impact of war and how situations we are thrust into shapes us one way or another. Plot =Part one= Part One looks at the history of Nigeria and the factors that led to the Civil War. It narrates a childhood experience not in secessionist Biafra but being caught in the middle when the author's home city Benin was captured by Biafran soldiers. Defend the Defenseless provides both an invaluable historical background and a candid account of the author's personal experience of the Biafran war with her family. It tells of the pain of separation and loss, the joy of survival and reunion; and the consequences of the war that still linger on today. =Part two= Part Two covers a war of a different kind. It is about the battle for democracy under the third dispensation. A war of words, a battle of protest and resistance. The then U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria, Walter Carrington, who although a diplomat was a front row participant in the battle against the authoritarian military ruler to ensure Nigeria returned to democracy and that human rights were observed. A native Nigerian and a naturalized American, as the Ambassador's wife, the author found herself increasingly committed as they stood side by side with the Nigerian people. Behind the scene events that have never been revealed; letters and other documents; an epic love story destined to be; all link back to the Biafran war. Up front and personal are some of the accounts including being the first Nigerian selected to give the Harvard commencement Graduate oration. =Part three= Part Three highlights the countries and individuals who played a role. What was the attitude of some major countries towards Biafra during the war and their views on agitation for the restoration of Biafra now? It details Nigeria's turbulent journey since the war. It highlights the mantra the author's late father gave her which makes sure we look out for the vulnerable among us...We must defend the defenseless.

Lord, how shall I meet Thee\\", literally: How shall I receive you) is a Christian hymn for Advent by Paul Gerhardt. It was first published in 1653 in the fifth edition of the hymnal Praxis Pietatis Melica by Johann Crüger, who also created a melody. Johann Sebastian Bach used it as a chorale in his Christmas Oratorio, but with a different melody. Catherine Winkworth translated five of its ten stanzas.  History  Paul Gerhardt wrote the lyrics in the first person, beginning with the theme, the question how to receive Jesus who is expected to arrive. The poet alludes to biblical narrations, such as his entry into Jerusalem and the parable of the ten virgins. The lyricist was also inspired by prophetic words from the Old Testament. The hymn appeared first in the fifth edition of the hymnal Praxis Pietatis MelicaCrüger, Johann: Praxis Pietatis Melica. Das ist: Übung der Gottseligkeit in Christlichen und trostreichen Gesängen. Editio V. Runge, Berlin 1653, pp. 779 ff. (Digitalisat der Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek). by Johann Crüger in 1653.  Text  The song is structured in ten stanzas of eight lines each, in bar form. The singer, speaking in the first person, addresses Jesus, establishing a relationship. The first question is \\"How shall I receive you?\\". The first five stanzas, using the verbs \\"empfangen\\" (receive) and \\"umfangen\\" (surround\\") expand God's love for humans. The image of a \\"Fackel\\" (torch) in the first stanza relates to the parable of the ten virgins,() the image of palm branches offered for the reception is reminiscent of the entry into Jerusalem (). The later five stanzas describe the condition of the congregation as stressful and threatened by enemies, pointing out especially fear of a day of wrath which is expected in a near future (stanza 6: \\"steht vor der Tür\\" (stands at the door, as in ). The term Advent (arrival) appears in four meanings in the following stanzas: in mercy, as redeemer, as king, and as judge. Catherine Winkworth translated five of its ten stanzas freely, beginning \\"Ah! Lord, how shall I meet Thee\\".  Melodies and settings  Johann Crüger first published the hymn in 1653 in the fifth edition of the hymnal Praxis Pietatis Melica by Johann Crüger, with a melody he composed himself. Dietrich Buxtehude arranged the hymn as a cantata, BuxWV 109. The first stanza from the hymn also appears in Johann Sebastian Bach's Christmas Oratorio,BWV 248.5 but set to Hans Leo Hassler's \\"Befiehl du deine Wege\\" melody (Zahn 5385a)--the same melody as \\"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\\",BWV 244.54 which returns in the work's final movement. In the current Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch, the song is EG 11. It is also part of several other hymnals and songbooks.  Literature  *Paul Gerhardt: Dichtungen und Schriften.

Owned by a Sheriff of Monmouthshire in the early 1600s, it was rebuilt by the Cecil family in the mid 17th century as a substantial mansion to the typical Elizabethan e-plan. Its fortunes declined in the 19th century by which point it had been reduced to a farmhouse and much of its external and internal fittings were removed or replaced. The farmhouse is Grade II* listed and a number of the ancillary buildings have their own Grade II listings. History and description The farmhouse was constructed in the very late 16th century, Cadw recording that the owner was probably John Gainsford, who served as Sheriff in 1604. The oldest part of the building appears to date from 1590-1630. In the later 17th century, the house was extended as an E-plan mansion, by a cadet branch of the Cecils. The house was restored in the 19th century, although by this date its status had declined to that of a farmhouse. In the very early 20th century its wooden panelling was removed to the nearby mansion, Hilston Park. The architectural historian John Newman describes Lower Dyffryn as an \\"extraordinarily remote (and) melancholy\\" house. It is constructed of Old Red Sandstone rubble, of two storeys, with a two-storey porch. Newman also records details remaining of the 17th century setting, including a gazebo set in the wall of an enclosed garden. The farmhouse remains in private ownership and is a Grade II* listed building. The garden walls have their own Grade II listing, as do the granary,, the \\"quite grand\\" haybarn, and the shelter shed.

He is hailed as the “King of White Truffles” and was appointed a “Worldwide Ambassador of the White Truffle” by the Piedmontese Regional Enoteca Cavour.  Career  A native of Clusone, Bergamo in Northern Italy, Bombana was inspired by his grandmother who used to cook for an aristocratic family. As a child, his pastime was not only eating but observing all stages of his grandmother’s preparation. After finishing hotel school, Bombana trained and apprenticed at one of the best Italian restaurants at that time, Antica Osteria del Ponte, with acclaimed chef Ezio Santin. In 1983 he moved to Los Angeles to work with one of the most respected Italian restaurateurs, Mauro Vincenti. In the 1990s he arrived in Hong Kong to open Toscana at the Ritz-Carlton. “I knew I wanted to come to Asia. I was young. I wanted the experience even though I loved California.” In 2008 the Ritz-Carlton closed down to redevelop the building and two years later Bombana opened 8½ Otto e Mezzo Bombana. The name is a tribute to Bombana's favorite Italian film director Federico Fellini’s 1963 autobiographical movie 8½. In 2013, Chef Bombana developed a more casual, refined trattoria concept called CIAK - In The Kitchen, in The Landmark in Hong Kong. It was followed by CIAK – All Day Italian in The Cityplaza mall, Quarry Bay. Both outlets are listed in the Bib Gourmands section of the Michelin Guide. Chef Bombana expanded his Otto e Mezzo brand into The Galaxy Macau in 2015. It now holds one Michelin star. Otto e Mezzo Shanghai opened in 2016, which now possesses two Michelin stars. He has also opened in Beijing, China, the restaurant Opera Bombana. In February 2017, Bombana received The Diners Club® Lifetime Achievement Award for 2017 at a ceremony in Bangkok. In July of 2017, he opened another new restaurant in Hong Kong called Octavium, which he has called his ‘laboratory’. It is located on the 8th floor of One Chinachem Central.

The company was founded by a father and son team, Lewis and Walter Brockway in Auburn, Ohio. They first sold small garden tractors locally as the American Garden Tractor Company, of which there were about 20 tractors produced. Then they changed the name to Leader Tractor Company and began producing a larger version with a Chevrolet four Cylinder engine, of which about 500 were made. By 1945 the Chevrolet engines supply diminished and they began using Hercules Engine Company flat-head engines. The factory was eventually moved to Chagrin Falls, a short distance from Auburn, ostensibly because Auburn lacked a post office. The tractors were in relatively high demand, and were being marketed by The Schotts Brothers, who owned several car dealerships in Ohio. They provided a loan to the Brockways to increase production. However, when the Schotts called in the loan, which had a pay-on- demand clause, the Brockways were unable to pay and were forced to sell the company to the Schotts in 1949. The Schotts ceased production at the factory and liquidated the remaining inventory.

After winning his only race as a juvenile in 2016 he emerged as a top-class performer in the following year. He won the Greenham Stakes and finished second in the 2000 Guineas before recording his biggest victory in the St James's Palace Stakes. He went on to finish second in the Eclipse Stakes and third in the International Stakes before being retired to stud at the end of the year. His spell at stud proved unsuccessful and he returned to racing in the 2019 season. As a gelding in 2020 he recorded victories in the Al Rashidiya, Jebel Hatta, Bayerisches Zuchtrennen and Grosser Preis von Baden. Background Barney Roy is a bay horse with a white blaze and three long white socks bred in England by Eliza Park International. In November 2014 he was consigned to the Tattersalls December Foals sale and bought for 30,000 guineas by A T Bloodstock. In the following August the yearling was put up for auction at the Goffs Doncaster Premier Yearlings Sale and was bought for £70,000 by the bloodstock agents Peter & Ross Doyle. The colt entered the ownership of Sullivan Bloodstock Ltd and was sent into training with Richard Hannon Jr. at East Everleigh in Wiltshire. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Excelebration, an outstanding miler whose wins included the Prix du Moulin, Prix Jacques Le Marois and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Barney Roy's dam Alina showed little racing ability, being retired after running unplaced in two races as a two-year-old in France in 2012. She was the daughter of the Ridgewood Pearl Stakes winner Cheyenne Star and a descendant of the American broodmare Blazon who was a half-sister to both Exceller and Capote. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Barney Roy made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over one mile at Haydock Park on 24 September and started at odds of 9/1 in a ten-runner field. Ridden by Sean Levey he took the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win by three and a half lengths from the favourite Fujaira Bridge. =2017: three-year-old season= Before the start of the 2017 season, Barney Roy was privately acquired by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin stable. He was ridden in all of his races as a three- year-old by James Doyle. Barney Roy made his seasonal debut in the Greenham Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 22 April. He started the 5/2 second favourite behind the other Godolphin runner Dream Castle, whilst the best-fancied of the other eight contenders was the Patton Stakes winner War Secretary. After tracking the leaders, Barney Roy overtook Dream Castle to assume the lead inside the final furlong and stayed on well to win by two lengths. Richard Hannon commented \\"He has relaxed enormously... I was a bit worried coming back from a mile to seven and you can see why, as he just took his time getting going. I thought he was in trouble, then he went 'whoosh'. I've liked him for a long time, though. He has got a chance of going to the Guineas.\\" In the 209th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 6 May, Barney Roy started the 7/2 second choice in the betting behind the Irish colt Churchill. He raced in mid-division before making a forward move in the last quarter mile but lost ground when stumbling badly approaching the final furlong. He recovered well and stayed on in the closing stages to take second place, a length behind Churchill and a neck in front of the French-trained Al Wukair. Despite being regarded as a potential Epsom Derby contender, Barney Roy was kept to a mile and reappeared in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot on 20 June. Churchill went off at odds of 1/2 with Barney Roy next in the betting on 5/2. The other six runners were Thunder Snow, Rivet, Lancaster Bomber (fourth in the 2000 Guineas), Peace Envoy (Rochestown Stakes), Forest Ranger and Mr Scaramanga. Barney Roy settled in fourth place as Rivet and Lancaster Bomber set the pace, before moving to the outside to make his challenge in the straight. He went to the front a furlong out and kept on to win by a length and a head from Lancaster Bomber and Thunder Snow, with Churchill well beaten in fourth. After the race Hannon said \\"He is the horse we always thought he was. We went to the Guineas to prove he is a good horse and he did that. He was slightly unlucky there and he has won very well today. He has a lovely long stride and he uses that. He takes time to get going and no doubt he will get further. I thought this track would suit him as the dips at Newmarket just caught him out.\\" On 8 July Barney Roy was moved up in distance and matched against older horses in the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park. Starting the 9/4 second favourite behind the Derby runner-up Cliffs of Moher he settled in midfield before moving up to challenge for the lead in the straight. After a sustained struggle against the four- year-old Ulysses he was beaten a nose by his older rival in a photo-finish. In August Barney Roy faced Ulysses again in the International Stakes at York Racecourse. Racing on softer ground than he had previously encountered he briefly took the lead in the straight but was overtaken a furlong out and came home third behind Ulysses and Churchill. On 21 October the colt started 9/2 second favourite for the Champion Stakes at Ascot but ran poorly and finished ninth of the ten runners, seventeen lengths behind the winner Cracksman. On 17 November it was announced that Barney Roy had been retired from racing. Hannon described him as \\"by far the best colt I've trained and the most athletic horse I have seen\\". =2018: stud career= Barney Roy began his stallion career at Darley's Dalham Hall Stud at a fee of £10,000. In May 2018 Darley announced that Barney Roy was subfertile and options were being considered about his future, including a possible return to racing. =2019: five-year- old season= After proving to be infertile at stud, Barney Roy was gelded and sent back into training with Charlie Appleby for the 2019 season. On 1 May Barney Roy began his comeback in the Listed Paradise Stakes over the straight mile at Ascot. Ridden by William Buick he started the 6/4 favourite and took the lead approaching the final furlong but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a neck by the four-year-old Zaaki. Three weeks later he was sent to France and started the 4/5 favourite for the Listed Prix de Montretout over 1600 metres at Longchamp, a race which saw him reunited with Doyle. After struggling to obtain a clear run in the closing stages he accelerated into the lead 50 metres from the finish and won by half a length from Bayoun. At Royal Ascot on 18 June the gelding was made 5/1 favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes but never looked likely to win and came home eighth of the sixteen runners behind Lord Glitters. He did not race again in 2019. Pedigree * Barney Roy was inbred 4 × 4 to Danzig, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

He then studied mathematics at ETH Zürich, where in 1935 he received his promotion (Ph.D) under George Pólya with thesis Über eine Interpretation gewisser Konvergenz- und Fortsetzungseigenschaften Dirichlet’scher Reihen.Pfluger, Albert. \\"Über eine Interpretation gewisser Konvergenz- und Fortsetzungseigenschaften Dirichlet'scher Reihen.\\" Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici 8, no. 1 (1935): 89–129. Afterwards, he became a Gymnasium teacher at the canton school in Zug and the canton school in Solothurn. He received his habilitation qualification in 1938 and in 1939 became a professor extraordinarius for applied mathematics and mathematical physics at the University of Fribourg. At ETH Zürich he became a professor extraordinarius in 1940 and in 1943 a professor ordinarius in the professorial chair vacated by George Pólya in 1940. Pfluger retired from ETH Zürich in 1978 as professor emeritus. He did research on the value distribution theory of Rolf Nevanlinna, potential theory, conformal maps and quasiconformal mapping, as well as Riemann surfaces. In 1957 Pfluger's monograph Theorie der Riemannschen Flächen was published in Springer's series Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften.Pfluger, Albert. Theorie der Riemannschen Flächen. Springer, Berlin/Göttingen/Heidelberg 1957 (Die Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften. vol. 89). With Joseph Hersch, he introduced in 1952 a function (now called the Hersch-Pfluger distortion function) useful in estimating the distortion of quasiconformal mappings.Joseph Hersch und Albert Pfluger, Généralisation du lemme de Schwarz et du principe de la mesure harmonique pour les fonctions pseudo-analytiques. Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences Paris, Tome 234, pp. 43-45, 1952. Entire functions with certain regularity properties were introduced and extensively studied by Pfluger and Boris Levin; these functions are now referred to as functions of completely regular growth in the sense of Levin and Pfluger. Pfluger served a two-year term as president of the Swiss Mathematical Society in 1950–1951. In 1973 he was elected a foreign member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences. His doctoral students include Peter Henrici and Heinz Rutishauser. Pfluger was married since 1938 to Maria Jeger. Selected publications *with G.

These curves are commonly used in hydrology for flood forecasting and civil engineering for urban drainage design. However, the IDF curves are also analysed in hydrometeorology because of the interest in the time concentration or time-structure of the rainfall. (pdf)  Mathematical approaches  The IDF curves can take different mathematical expressions, theoretical or empirically fitted to observed rainfall data. For each duration (e.g. 5, 10, 60, 120, 180 ... minutes), the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), and a determined frequency or return period is set. Therefore, the empirical IDF curve is given by the union of the points of equal frequency of occurrence and different duration and intensityTémez, J. (1978): Cálculo Hidrometeorológico de caudales máximos en pequeñas cuencas naturales. Dirección General de Carreteras. Madrid. España. 111p. Likewise, a theoretical or semi-empirical IDF curve is one whose mathematical expression is physically justified, but presents parameters that must be estimated by empirical fits. = Empirical approaches = There is a large number of empirical approaches that relate the intensity (I), the duration (t) and the return period (p), from fits to power laws such as: * Sherman's formula,Sherman, C. (1931): Frequency and intensity of excessive rainfall at Boston, Massachusetts, Transactions, American Society of Civil Engineers, 95, 951–960. with three parameters (a, c and n), which are a function of the return period, p: :: I(t)=frac a {(t+c)^n} * Chow's formula,Chow, V.

Balderas, México, Limusa. 303 p. with four parameters (a, c, m and n), already adjusted for all return periods of interest: :: I(t,p)=a cdot frac{p^m}{(t+c)^n} In hydrometeorology, the simple power law (taking  c = 0) is used according to Monjo (2016) as a measure of the time-structure of the rainfall: :: I(t)=frac a {t^n} = I_oleft( frac{t_o} t right)^n where  I_o is defined as an intensity of reference for a fixed time  t_o, i.e.  a=I_o t_o^n, and  n is a non-dimensional parameter known as n-index.

By 1810, Hosack was no longer able to fund the garden's expenses, and sold the land to the State of New York. The property was given to Columbia College in 1814, and the gardens were abandoned. In the 1920s, it became the site of Rockefeller Center. Establishment and development In 1801, New York physician David Hosack created the Elgin Botanic Garden, named for his father's Scottish birthplace. Hosack was among the leading medical practitioners of his time, and was later remembered primarily as the physician who attended the 1804 duel between his friends Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, and who treated Hamilton's fatal injuries. thumb320pxEngraving () of a drawing by L. Simond, titled View of the Botanic Garden at Elgin in the vicinity of the City of New York'' Elgin was the first public botanical garden in the United States. It was established with Hosack's purchase of of \\"common lands\\" from the City of New York for approximately $4,800, equivalent to $ in dollars. The location, outside of what was then the city limit, is bounded by present-day 47th Street on the south, 51st Street on the north, and Fifth Avenue on the east, reaching nearly to Sixth Avenue on the west. It is now the site of Rockefeller Center. The entire property \\"was intended by Professor Hosack for a botanical garden, the prime object of which was to be the collection and cultivation of native plants of this country, especially such as possess medicinal properties or are otherwise useful.\\" At his own expense, Hosack landscaped the garden with a variety of indigenous and exotic plants, mostly of American origin. By 1805, the garden was home to 1,500 species of plants from all over the world, including some rare specimens contributed by Thomas Jefferson. The following year, Hosack published Hortus Elginensis (1806), a catalogue and visitors' guide, containing an extensive list of the plants under cultivation at Elgin. Drawing of Elgin by Reinagle, frontispiece of Hosack's Hortus Elginensis catalogue (2nd ed., 1811) The grounds were fully enclosed by an imposing stone wall, tall and thick. Within the walls, a spacious greenhouse flanked by two hothouses presented a frontage running west from present-day Fifth Avenue, and encircled by what Hosack called a \\"belt of forest trees and shrubs judiciously chequered and mingled.\\" Hosack's funds were insufficient to support such a project indefinitely, and it was suggested that he was so preoccupied with his endeavors in the creation of a new medical school that he had neither time nor money to continue the garden. In 1808, Hosack was compelled to offer the property for sale, and for several years, he petitioned the New York State Legislature to purchase it and maintain it as an aid in medical education. Ultimately, in March 1810, the State of New York purchased Elgin for $75,000, leaving Hosack with a loss of $28,000 after his expenses to buy and develop the property. Responsibility for the property was given to the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, and in the 1811 second edition of the Hortus Elginensis catalogue, a frontispiece identified Elgin as \\"the Botanic Garden of the State of New-York\\". In a preface dated March 1811, Hosack wrote that Elgin had \\"been purchased by the State for the benefit of the Medical Schools of New-York\\", and projected his expectation that it would remain a permanent institution. The catalogue concluded with a note that \\"improvements which may hereafter take place in this institution, and the additions which may be made to the collection of plants, will in future be regularly published, as an annual report to the Legislature, and the Regents of the University.\\" Hosack continued to pay the garden's expenses until May 1811, when it was placed under the management of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, which had not yet merged with Columbia. The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 that laid out the scheme for New York City's future grid of streets and avenues gave names to the carriage road leading to Elgin's garden, which became Sixth Avenue, and to the pathway that fronted Elgin's south-facing greenhouses, which became 50th Street. Abandonment and later uses In April 1814, the New York legislature voted to transfer the land to Columbia College, with the provision that the college would be moved to the site, although Columbia successfully lobbied for the removal of that condition in 1819. Columbia had no interest in continuing to maintain the costly botanical garden, and turned over responsibility for the gardens to Clement Clarke Moore, best known as a writer and light poet. Beginning in March 1817, the property was leased to a series of individual tenants paying little or no rent, in return for obligations to maintain the grounds, while repeated applications from Hosack for a lease (in 1819, 1825, and 1828) were denied. By 1823, the property had sunk \\"into utter decrepitude\\", and the abandoned botanical gardens eventually fell into decay. Surviving plant specimens were shipped to Morningside Heights where they were replanted at the Bloomingdale Asylum, and Hosack's library of horticultural texts became part of the collection of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. The property became known as Columbia's \\"Upper Estate,\\" and by 1879, twelve acres had been fully developed for residential use, with 298 rowhouses in a then-stylish neighborhood. By the mid-1920s, however, it had deteriorated into \\"an unseemly collection of boarding houses, nightclubs and speakeasies on the northern boundary of New York's theater district.\\" In late 1928, Columbia University agreed to lease a three-block portion of the land to John D. Rockefeller Jr. for the construction of Rockefeller Center, in return for approximately $3.5 million annual rent until 1952, followed by options for three 21-year renewals. Rockefeller subsequently acquired additional lots from Columbia, as well as surrounding properties. The original property was still owned by Columbia until 1985, when it was sold for $400 million.

In the 1930s, The Federal Art Project sponsored the Index of American Design which \\"produced a pictorial survey of the crafts and decorative arts of the United States from the early colonial period to 1900. Artists working for the Index produced nearly 18,000 meticulously faithful watercolor drawings, documenting material culture by largely anonymous artisans.\\" Artist Tabea Hosier produced an enduring representation of Elgin Botanical Gardens. *In the 1960s, New York artist Frederick Elmiger (1890–1975) painted Elgin Botanic Garden, part of a series of imagined scenes from New York City's early history. The brightly- colored painting, in watercolor and gouache, depicts elegantly dressed New Yorkers strolling on a garden path on a sunny spring day, with Elgin's greenhouses in the background.

The depiction of this chariot race on the east pediment of the Temple of Zeus, along with that of the 12 labors of Heracles on the metopes of the frieze, relate to the location of the temple in Olympia; the chariot race and Heracles were both believed to have started the tradition of the Olympic Games.  Description  Temple of Zeus at Olympia In the center stands Zeus watching over Pelops to his right and Oenomaus to his left. Beside them are two female figures, followed by the chariots about to be raced on. In the corners of the pediment are male figures, presumably spectators, who are sitting or lying down in order to fill the narrow space.  Location  Olympia is in the northwest portion of the Peloponnese. It was a panhellenic sanctuary, meaning that it was open to all Greeks regardless of the city-state they were a part of. Olympia was also home of the Olympic Games, a Panhellenic athletic tournament occurring every four years wherein a sacred truce was declared among the poleis.  Mythology  Relief of Pelops's chariot race In Greek mythology, Pelops had sought to marry Hippodamia. Her father, King Oenomaus, did not want to marry off his daughter, so he challenged each of her suitors to a chariot race. Before Pelops, he had beaten and killed all of these suitors, for he had immortal horses given to him by his father Ares. Pelops, however, called on Poseidon, his former lover, for assistance, and he gave Pelops a gold chariot with winged horses pulling it. Another common view is that Pelops had bribed Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, into replacing the bronze linchpins of the chariot with ones made of wax. Afterwards, Pelops kills Myrtilus in order to avoid paying the bribe.

As one of the UK's largest operational deployments at the time, the task force comprised over 300 military personnel. The operation successfully ended in January 2020. Background In 2011, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan following 25 years of civil war. The United Nations Security Council announced that the situation represented a threat to international peace and security and established the United Nations Mission in South Sudan to bring about peace and conditions for development. The conflict escalated in 2013 due to clashes between the government and opposition forces and, as a result, 60% of the population experienced food insecurity, with 2.2 million out of its 13 million population becoming refugees and 1.9 million becoming internally displaced. In July 2019, there were 182,050 civilians in the six UN Protection of Civilian sites in South Sudan. Deployment The deployment began in 2017 with a task force operating in two U.N. locations; Malakal and Bentiu. The task force comprised 25 units, totaling up to 378 service personnel across all three services. The units involved included: * British Army Royal Engineers *21 Engineer Regiment *32 Engineer Regiment *36 Engineer Regiment  69 Gurkha Field Squadron *39 Engineer Regiment *71 Engineer Regiment *62 Works Group Army Medical Services *Royal Army Medical Corps 2 Medical Brigade *335 Medical Evacuation Regiment 16 Medical Regiment  The Rifles  Royal Logistics Corps  Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers  Royal Corps of Signals  Intelligence Corps  Royal Military Police  Brigade of Gurkhas *Royal Air Force  Royal Air Force Medical Service *Royal Navy Royal Navy Medical Service  Conclusion  Operation Trenton drew to a close in January 2020, four years after it first began.

It was launched in April 2014 by Prime Minister David Cameron in response to the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping. Background From 2009, Boko Haram, a jihadist terrorist organisation based in northeastern Nigeria, waged an insurgency in an attempt to institute an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria. By 2014, violent attacks perpetrated by the group had killed tens of thousands of people. A government crackdown ensued which saw a state of emergency declared in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. Under pressure, Boko Haram was forced to retreat to rural, mountainous areas where they began to target civilians. Their numbers were bolstered by Islamist militants fleeing from nearby Mali due to a French counter-insurgency operation there. In 2010, in opposition to Western education — which it claimed detracted from Islamic teachings — Boko Haram began to target schools. The group was known for targeting female students, which it believed should not be educated and instead used as cooks or sex slaves. =Attacks on British citizens= In 2011, Boko Haram abducted a British citizen along with an Italian citizen in Birnin-Kebbi and threatened to execute them unless demands were met. The UK launched a rescue mission carried out by the special forces unit, the Special Boat Service. The rescue attempt failed, resulting in the execution of both hostages. In another incident, Ansaru, an off-shoot of Boko Haram, kidnapped seven construction workers, including one Briton in February 2013. The hostages were executed preemptively in March after the captors mistakenly believed British military deployments in nearby Mali (which were in support of Operation Newcombe) were part of a rescue operation. In 2014, the group was blamed for 4,000 deaths and it received support from other Islamist terrorist organisations, including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al- Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. =Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping= The action sequence of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping in 2014. On 14 April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 female students from a secondary school in Chibok, Nigeria. In the days following, the Nigerian military announced most of the girls had been freed or had escaped, however parents claimed their children remained unaccounted for. Many parents ventured out to search for their children and claimed they saw no evidence of any military support. Major General Chris Olukolade subsequently admitted that the military's earlier statement was incorrect and that \\"more than 200\\" girls remained missing. Government inaction caused uproar in Nigeria, resulting in marches and a \\"#BringBackOurGirls\\" hashtag trend on social media. On 4 May, President Goodluck Jonathan made his first public comments on the abduction and announced the country was seeking assistance from the United States and other world powers in tackling Nigeria's \\"security challenge\\". British and American security experts subsequently arrived on 9 May. In a phone call to President Jonathan, British Prime Minister David Cameron offered the UK's support in finding the missing schoolgirls. Deployment In May 2014, the Royal Air Force deployed a Sentinel R1 surveillance aircraft from No. 5 Squadron RAF to assist with the search. The aircraft was based in Accra, Ghana and developed a fault days into its deployment, resulting in it needing repairs in Senegal. In 10 sorties, the aircraft had mapped the whole of Nigeria using its dual-mode synthetic aperture radar / moving target indication (SAR/MTI) radar. A team consisting of military advisors was also deployed to Nigeria's capital, Abuja, to work alongside similar American and French teams. The deployment augmented an existing British Military Advisory Training Team (BMATT) and included special forces personnel. In August 2014, three Tornado GR4 strike aircraft from No. 2 Squadron RAF were deployed to Chad. Based in N'Djamena, the aircraft flew over Nigeria equipped with RAPTOR reconnaissance pods and supported the search for the missing schoolgirls.Air International April 2019, pp. 73–74. The detachment comprised up to 91 military personnel and had returned to the UK by 17 October. A total of 56 sorties had been made, including the transit from the UK. The aircraft were also unarmed and required no tanker support. The UK also provided satellite imagery. In June 2014, Foreign Secretary William Hague announced the UK would increase its military aid to Nigeria, including a tactical training programme. In 2015, the UK had around 130 military personnel deployed in Nigeria, including Short Term Training Teams (STTT) which were mainly supported by 2nd Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment. In December, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon announced this deployed force would be doubled to \\"up to 300\\" in 2016. The STTT's were typically deployed on six-week rotations. In 2016, a team of RAF personnel was deployed to provide the Nigerian Air Force training on airfield defence and counter-insurgency. 2nd Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment remained in the country through 2016 and provided training on infantry skills, civil-military affairs, IEDs and leadership. Nearly 1,000 Nigerian military personnel had benefited from British military training. A total of 350 British military personnel were deployed to the country, including 101 (City of London) Engineer Regiment. In 2017, 700 British military personnel had been deployed to Nigeria, including personnel from 7th Infantry Brigade and the RAF Regiment, training over 28,500 members of the Nigerian military. The third STTT in the five-year programme saw involvement from No. 5 Royal Air Force Protection Wing and No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment. In 2018, the UK expanded its provision of equipment and training, having trained 30,000 Nigerian military personnel since 2015. In 2019, No. 5 Force Protection Wing RAF deployed its eighth of ten STTTs. 7,000 kg of equipment necessary for the deployment was transported via an A400M Atlas transport aircraft. The RAF Police were also involved in this deployment and delivered training on military working dogs, counter intelligence and specialist investigations.

It is native to the Pacific coasts of North America, its range extending from Alaska to California. Description L. bellus is a small crab with a carapace width of up to . The carapace is more rounded than some related species and the upper side is covered with low, rounded projections known as tubercles. There are more prominent tubercles on the fifth, sixth and seventh segments of the chelipeds; the legs are covered with setae (bristles) and have black claws. The color of this crab is quite variable; its color range includes off-white, various combinations of bluish- black and red, dull dark red and nearly black, the underside is usually whitish. This crab could be confused with Glebocarcinus oregonensis which is a similar size, but that species has spiny ridges on the chelae instead of tubercles. Distribution L. bellus is found along the Pacific coast of North America. Two subspecies are recognised: L. b. bellus ranges from Resurrection Bay, Alaska southward to Cayucos, California, while L. b. diegensis ranges from Monterey Bay southwards to San Diego. Ecology Breeding begins in April in the Puget Sound area; the female carries the eggs around on the underside of her abdomen for their protection and they hatch from May onwards. Many females carry a second brood which hatches in August. After hatching, the zoea larvae become free-living and form part of the plankton.

A rescue team was flown from Washington DC on Air Force 2. A three-day effort to retrieve Mitchell was aborted after repeated failures and a partial collapse. The cave was abandoned and blasted shut, essentially making the cave a tomb. Mitchell's death made headlines again forty-one years later when a group returned to the cave and successfully recovered his remains. Supposedly the cave waters were dye traced to East Creek 3 miles away.

It is now used as a public house called the Robert Raikes Inn. History Robert Raikes' House was built for use as a merchants house in 1560. In the early 18th century the rear of the house was extended and internal alterations were carried out. Robert Raikes the Elder started publishing the Gloucester Journal from the building on 9 April 1722. Robert Raikes, the Younger moved his printing business into the house in 1758 where he continued to publish the Gloucester Journal. In 1772, he moved into the house to live with his family. Robert Raikes was a promoter of the Sunday school movement, he held Sunday school sessions in the houses garden and Roberts wife used to serve plum cake to the children. After his death, it was again used as a merchants house and shop. There were minor alterations made to the building throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1952, the building was grade II listed. In 1973, the Dirty Duck restaurant opened on the site later becoming the Golden Cross public house in 1975. In 2006, Samuel Smiths bought the building and spent £4.5 million on its restoration. As part of this restoration, the shop front was replaced by more traditional wood-framed walls, also the Malt and Hops pub in the rear courtyard was demolished. It reopened in November 2008 as a public house. Architecture Robert Raikes' House is primarily made of a timber-frame with wattle and daub panels. It has a slate double purling roof and is additionally supported by two brick stacks with octagonal shafts. The front of the building has three timber-framed gables. In the 18th-century, a parallel range and cross wing with a raised cruck roof was built in brick at the rear of the building. The building has three storeys, which are jettied, and includes an attic and a cellar. The first floor jetty is supported by consoles, the second and attic floors are supported by curved knee braces. At the front of the building on the ground floor are large windows with glazing bars between the supporting timber posts, which were added in the early 19th-century. The style of the top two floors is typical of west country decorative timber framing. On these floors each of the three bays under the gables is split into three further sections by supporting timber posts and each of these is split again into three more horizontal sections. Each of which are decorated with patterns made of timber. The gables have scalloped and pierced barge boards decorated with spike finials. The doorway is on the right hand side of the second bay. The interior of the building consists of seven rooms, with the rooms at the back of the building being more lavishly decorated than the rooms at the front. The ground floor is mostly open as it is used as a public house bar. It has exposed ceiling beams and joists which are supported by wooden posts. In the centre of the building is an 18th-century open well staircase with quarter landings, the walls are decorated with dado rails and half height wooden panels. The first floor landing has a two bay timber screen with arches on each side. There is a bedroom with full height panelling and this level also has 16th-century exposed timber framing in several walls. In the 18th century, a stone chimney with an architrave surround was added this is also present in the rooms on the upper floors. There is a second circular staircase on the north side of the building. The cellar consists of brick walls with brick barrel vaults. Throughout the building are a mix of paintings, technical drawings of the building itself and a biography of Robert Raikes. At the rear of the building is a large courtyard.

It went on to become a Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry (DLI) in the Territorial Force and saw action as infantry and pioneers in some of the bloodiest actions on the Western Front during World War I. Between the wars it became an air defence unit, serving during World War II in The Blitz and the campaign in North West Europe, when it had a special role in the Rhine crossing. Postwar it continued in the Territorial Army in the air defence role until 1975, when its successor unit reverted to infantry. Origin During an invasion scare in 1859, large numbers of part-time Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) were formed throughout Great Britain, eager to supplement the Regular British Army in case of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163–8.Westlake. The 3rd (The Sunderland) Durham Rifle Volunteer Corps was one such unit, with the first officers' commissions being issued on 6 March 1860. By 1862 the unit had six companies under the command of Major Lord Adolphus Vane-Tempest, MP for North Durham.Beckett, Appendix VII.Frederick, p. 145.Westlake, p. 75.Dunn, p. 10. After the death of Vane-Tempest in 1864, Edward Temperley Gourley (later MP for Sunderland) was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel in command on 10 November 1865.Army List, various dates. The 'Sunderland' title was authorised in 1867. The unit's uniform was scarlet, with blue facings. The Regimental Colour of the former Sunderland Volunteer Infantry raised in the Napoleonic Wars (1803–13) was presented to the new corps in 1860. A purpose-built drill hall was opened in Livingstone Road in 1880.Dunn, pp. 9–11. Under the scheme of 'localisation' introduced by the Cardwell Reforms in 1873, the Durham RVCs, together with the Durham Militia and the two Regular battalions (68th Light Infantry and 106th Light Infantry) that later formed the Durham Light Infantry (DLI), constituted Brigade No 3, based at Sunderland in the Durham sub- district of Northern District. While the sub-districts were referred to as 'brigades', they were purely administrative organisations and the Volunteers were excluded from the 'mobilisation' part of the Cardwell system, though they carried out joint manoeuvres.Training Depots, 1873–1881 at Regiments.org. Under the Childers Reforms the Volunteers were affiliated to their local Regular Army regiment – the DLI in the case of the Durham RVCs – as Volunteer Battalions on 1 July 1881. The Sunderland rifles changed its facing colour to white in 1884 to match the DLI (the DLI reverted to its traditional dark green at the beginning of the 20th Century) and formally became the 3rd (Sunderland) Volunteer Battalion of the DLI in December 1887.Dunn, p. 12. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 proposed a more comprehensive Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185–6.Dunlop, pp. 60–1. Under this scheme the Volunteer Battalions of the DLI and the Northumberland Fusiliers formed the Tyne and Tees Brigade until a separate Durham Light Infantry Brigade was formed in 1902. The 3rd VB gained an extra company in 1900, giving it a total of six rifle companies and one of cyclists, and it contributed detachments to three successive service companies of Volunteers who served alongside the Regular DLI in the Second Boer War and gained its first battle honour: South Africa 1900–1902.Dunn, pp. 12–3; Appendix 1..Leslie. Territorial Force Cap badge of the Durham Light Infantry, Territorial version (1909–53). When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the 3rd VB became the 7th Battalion Durham Light Infantry. There were eight companies, six at Livingstone Road and two at South Shields that had previously formed part of the 5th VB DLI. The cyclist company transferred to the Northern Cyclist Battalion.London Gazette 20 March 1908.Dunn, pp. 13–7. The 7th DLI formed part of the Durham Light Infantry Brigade in the Northumbrian Division of the TF.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 93–100.DLI at Long, Long Trail.50 Division at Regimental Warpath. When war broke out in 1914, the battalion was commanded by Lt-Col Ernest Vaux, of the Sunderland-based Vaux Breweries family. He had formerly served in the 1st Durham Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers) and had won the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) with the 5th Imperial Yeomanry during the Boer War.Dunn, pp. 208–9.Wyrall, p. 2. World War I =Mobilisation= The outbreak of World War I found the DLI Brigade at Conwy in North Wales at its annual training camp, which had started on 25 July. Orders to prepare for mobilisation were received on 3 August and the battalion returned to Sunderland by train, where mobilisation began the next day. The Northumbrian Division then took up its war stations in the Tyne Defences as part of Central Force. The 7th DLI was distributed around Sunderland by companies, to a roller-skating rink in Park Lane, to Hudson Road School, to Hendon Valley Road School, and to the Granary at Sunderland Docks.James, pp. 100–1.Dunn, pp. 23–8.Wyrall, pp. 3–4. On 31 August 1914, the formation of Reserve or 2nd Line units for each existing TF unit was authorised. Initially these were formed from men who had not volunteered for overseas service, and the recruits who were flooding in. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right. They were distinguished by the prefix '2/', the parent 1st Line battalion taking '1/'. Later 3rd Line or Reserve battalions were formed to train drafts for the 1st and 2nd Line battalions.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Dunn, p. 196. =1/7th Battalion= After the Home Service men had been separated, the DLI Brigade concentrated under canvas at Ravensworth Castle, Gateshead, where the training became more intense. When the autumn weather deteriorated, the troops were once again billeted in schools around Gateshead. Orders to proceed overseas to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) arrived in early April, and the transport and equipment of the battalion was completed. The advance party left Gateshead for Boulogne on 17 April, the rest of the battalion following on 19 April, arriving the same day.Dunn, pp. 29–35.Wyrall, pp. 4–5. 2nd Battle of Ypres The division completed its concentration in the area of Steenvoorde and went straight into action at the Second Battle of Ypres. The DLI Bde was at Ryveld, and at 16.30 on 23 April 1/7th Bn began marching to Vlamertinge, arriving soon after midnight and being billeted in a hop warehouse. Next day the brigade received a succession of countermanded orders, ending with 1/7th Bn bivouacking under shellfire in the grounds of Potijze Chateau. British forces were fighting to stabilise the British line (the Battle of St Julien) and the Northumbrian Division's units were thrown in piecemeal. 1/7th Battalion came under the command of 2nd Bn King's Shropshire Light Infantry and at 14.00 on 26 April Lt-Col Vaux was ordered to move up towards Gravenstafel. The battalion advanced across open fields in 'artillery formation' under heavy fire, watched by Col Vaux standing in the open with his shepherd's crook in his hand. They reached a position north of Zonnebeke to support 85th Bde, before being ordered to retire after dark to Verlorenhoek, where they spent the whole of 27 April. Unlike the rest of the brigade, 1/7th Bn's casualties in their first action had been light, though they suffered a trickle of other casualties before being relieved from the front line on 3 May.Dunn, pp. 36–48.Wyrall, pp. 5, 10–11, 20–1, 34–5, 40. During the Battle of Frezenberg Ridge (8–13 May), 1/7th DLI was engaged in digging a new second line of defences (the GHQ line), sometimes under shellfire. The Northumbrian Division officially became the 50th (Northumbrian) Division on 14 May, when the DLI Bde became 151st (Durham Light Infantry) Brigade.50th Division at Long, Long Trail.Dunn, pp. 48–52.Wyrall, pp. 52–4. On 21 May the battalion was sent up to learn the routine of trench holding with 85th Bde. A and B Companies were attached to 3rd Bn Royal Fusiliers, HQ, C and D Companies to 3rd Bn Middlesex Regiment. The brigade's trenches were knee-deep in mud. While the battalion was in the line, the Germans launched another serious attack on Whit Monday (24 May) preceded by a gas cloud (the Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge). At one point Lt-Col Vaux ordered his men out of the trench and to stand up to avoid the low-hanging gas cloud, which they did, singing the hymn Abide with Me. The Fusiliers and Durhams repulsed the initial attack, but a neighbouring unit was driven back and the battalions' left flank was open. They were pushed back to the third line, just behind Railway Wood before reinforcements (including C and D Companies of 7th DLI) arrived to help halt the enemy advance. The battalion lost 29 killed, 76 wounded or gassed, and 183 missing, mainly Prisoners of War (PoW) from the overrun front trench.Dunn, pp. 52–68.Wyrall, pp. 59–70. Over the following months the division was concentrated and took over its own section of the line south of Ypres, with 1/7th DLI occupying dug-outs in Sanctuary Wood when not in the front line. It then moved to better trenches near Kemmel, where it received a draft of 160 reinforcements from home.Dunn, pp. 69–76.Wyrall, pp. 72–4. By the end of July the division had moved to the Armentières sector, and stayed in this quiet sector until mid-November, when it moved to Merris.Dunn, pp. 79–87.Wyrall, pp. 90–2. Pioneer battalion Men of 1/7th Bn DLI parading for the trenches, Reningelst, near Ypres, 29 April 1916. 1/7th DLI left 151st Bde on 16 November 1915 to become the divisional pioneer battalion. In this role it provided working parties to assist the divisional Royal Engineers (RE) in tasks ranging from trench digging and wiring, to road making, while remaining fighting soldiers. The men received extra pay and the battalion transport was augmented to carry the necessary tools and equipment, but the battalion machine gun section was transferred out: brigade machine gun companies were formed soon afterwards. Lieutenant-Colonel Vaux was instrumental in the battalion's conversion, arguing that many of the Sunderland shipbuilders in its ranks already had the skills required.DLI at Regimental Warpath.Dunn, p. 88.Wyrall, p. 101. In December 1915 the division returned to the Ypres Salient, in the Hill 60 sector, with 1/7th DLI billeted at 'Canada Huts' in appalling conditions. Here the battalion established repair workshops, cleared abandoned equipment, repaired communication trenches and set out dummy trenches to confuse the enemy. There was almost constant low-level fighting until the division was relieved at the beginning of April 1916 and moved to the Wytschaete sector, 1/7th DLI marching from Canada Huts to La Clytte. The usual trench work continued, often under shell and machine gun fire.Dunn, pp. 90–5.Wyrall, pp. 100–4, 118. Somme 50th (Northumbrian) Division was not involved in the Somme Offensive until its third phase (the Battle of Flers–Courcelette). The 1/7th DLI arrived in the area in mid-August and began training to construct a new cruciform pattern of strongpoint, then was engaged in building roads and tramways before the rest of the division took up its positions. For the attack, one company of 1/7th DLI was attached as pioneers to each attacking infantry brigade (A Company to 149th (Northumberland) Bde and D Company to 150th (York & Durham) Bde). The remaining platoons assisted 7th Field Company, RE, to repair the road bringing in supplies. 50th Division took its first objective in an hour and then struggled forward, taking heavy casualties, to reach the second objective, assisting 47th (1/2nd London) Division to capture High Wood. In the afternoon, 1/7th DLI worked under heavy shellfire on new communication trenches to link up the captured areas and to dig new gun positions. The division made further piecemeal advances during the Battle of Morval (25–28 September); during this whole time the battalion was constantly at work, suffering heavy casualties.Dunn, pp. 98–108.Wyrall, pp. 138–45, 148–54, 160–4. 50th Division made another setpiece attack at the Battle of the Transloy Ridges on 1 October. 1/7th Durham Light Infantry's task for this attack was to dig communication trenches forward from the jumping-off trenches to the captured objectives. Work commenced on 'North Durham Trench', 'South Durham Trench', 'Blaydon Trench' and 'Rutherford Alley' after dark the night before. The attack was generally successful, but the work continued even after the rest of the division was relieved on the night of 3/4 October. A and D Companies linked up Rutherford Alley but struggled to compete Durham Trench under fire, and C Company could not get their trench connected until 3 October; meanwhile B Company worked on the roads.Dunn, pp. 109–10.Wyrall, pp. 164–6, 170. William Orpen: The Butte de Warlencourt. 1/7th Durham Light Infantry remained just behind the front line preparing tramways across flooded shell-holes, and then built huts near Mametz Wood for the battalion, while the Lewis gun detachment and the band built a new divisional headquarters at Sabot Copse. The work was finished on 3 November and the battalion rested for one day before the 50th Division made a new attack on the Butte de Warlencourt on 5 November (celebrated as Inkermann Day by the DLI). 151st Bde and two battalions of 149th Bde made the attack, with B Company 1/7th DLI attached to 1/8th DLI in the right sector in 'Hexham Road' and C Company and a platoon of D Company to 1/9th DLI on the left in 'Abbaye Trench'. The men went forward in appalling conditions. B Company's task was to move overland and then extend 'Pioneer Alley' from 'Maxwell Trench' to 'Gird Trench' (the German front line), while C Company was to move up a communication trench and then continue 'Tail Trench' to reach 'Butte Trench' in front of Gird Trench. The companies suffered casualties from shellfire even before setting off. The left attack occupied the Butte de Warlencourt and passed beyond it, but the right attack was held p by machine gun fire and the German counter-barrage. B Company could do little, but C Company tried to link up with the parties on the butte. However, German counter-attacks drove the whole attack back to its starting point. The two companies lost 9 killed and 22 wounded.Dunn, pp. 112–4.Wyrall, pp. 171–81. Further lodgements made in the enemy positions on 14 November were also driven back. The division was then relieved on 17 November, but the pioneers continued their work behind the lines until the end of January 1917 when they were withdrawn for training and rest.Dunn, pp. 115–22.Wyrall, pp. 183–98. Arras From February the battalion was engaged in trench improvements and building camps until the division moved to the Arras sector in April. After the success of the opening attack of the Battle of Arras on 9 April, 50th Division followed hp through the attacking troops to keep the enemy retreating. This led to slow, costly advances while the 1/7th DLI kept the road repaired for supplies, then worked on strongpoints, wiring and constructing shelters, until they were relieved on 26 April.Dunn, pp. 122–9.Wyrall, pp. 205–25. 1/7th Durham Light Infantry spent most of May 1917 training and resting. The battalion lent its transport horses to the local farmers, for which Lt-Col Vaux was awarded the French Médaille d'honneur agricole. The summer was spent in the usual road building, trench digging and minor operations until 6 October when the battalion began a week's infantry training and received a draft of 210 reinforcements in preparation for active operations.Dunn, pp. 130–7.Wyrall, pp. 228-37. Passchendaele Pioneers laying duckboards at Passchendaele On 24 October the battalion moved into White Mill Camp at Elverdinghe in the Ypres sector, A and B Companies later moving to Red Rose Camp. The work was to maintain the constantly-shelled tracks and complete a duckboard track known as 'Railway Street' while the rest of the division took part in the Second Battle of Passchendaele The camps were regularly shelled and bombed, and the Lewis gun detachment took up forward positions to deal with low-flying aircraft. On the night of 31 October/1 November the camp and divisional area received a heavy bombing raid and the battalion suffered numerous casualties.Dunn, pp. 138–44.Wyrall, pp. 239–48. Captured German pillbox or 'Mebu' at Passchendaele After the Third Battle of Ypres petered out in the mud of Passchendaele, the division was relieved on 30 November, but the pioneers remained behind to carry on the work. It rejoined the division on 12 December and spent the winter building tracks through the terrible mud up the Passchendaele ridge, continuing to work when the division was relieved on 6 January 1918. This work included burying telephone cables and clearing captured enemy pillboxes.Dunn, pp. 144–8.Wyrall, pp. 249–53. Spring Offensive In February 1918 the BEF was extensively reorganised to deal with a severe manpower shortage. Pioneer battalions adopted a three- company establishment, the 1/7th DLI completing this on 24 February.Dunn, p. 149.Wyrall, pp. 253–4. The 50th Division moved south in March, taking over positions previously held by the French Army. The division was in Corps reserve when the German Spring Offensive opened on the morning of 21 March. It moved up in the evening and occupied the Green Line the following morning. But the trenches on the Green Line had barely been started, and the retreating British troops were streaming through the positions to the rear. Meanwhile, the Pioneers began work on a new defensive line from Le Mesnil to Athies. Under pressure on its flanks, 50th Division began withdrawing to this line on 23 March, while the 1/7th DLI moved back behind the Somme Canal ahead of it, shooting down a German aircraft that was machine-gunning the road. The whole division was back across the canal by the end of the day, ending the Battle of St Quentin.Dunn, pp. 149–51.Wyrall, pp. 259–72. On 24 March the 1/7th DLI was sent to defend the canal in a gap between the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division to the left and the 8th Division to the right. With the bridges destroyed this should have been a strong position, but during the night of 24/25 March German troops worked their way across a partially-destroyed bridge in 8th Division's sector, and outflanked the battalion (beginning the Actions at the Somme Crossings). The right-hand company was ordered to fall back to a ridge behind the canal, where they joined up with 1/5th DLI arriving to make a counter-attack. As the enemy continued to advance, and the right flank was 'in the air', the 1/5th DLI took up positions in a well-wired old trench, with part of the 1/7th DLI on each flank. The 1/5th Bn was ordered to 'hang on to the death' while the 1/7th was ordered to retire. Although the 1/7th's company commander offered to stay with the 1/5th, orders were then received for all troops to withdraw. The battalion retreated across open fields to take up positions behind Estrées shortly after midnight.Dunn, pp. 151–2.Wyrall, pp. 274–6, 284–6. On 26 March the pressure on both flanks forced the 50th Division back to a new position near Rosières, which was taken up by 14.00. The Germans took advantage of a gap in the line and pressed on (forcing the Battle of Rosières), so A and B Companies of 1/7th DLI were ordered to make a counter- attack on the village of Framerville on a broad spur running towards the River Somme, while 1/5th Bn Northumberland Fusiliers attacked on the left of the village. The attack was successful, the companies twice forcing their way through the village at bayonet-point, but the respite was temporary and a further withdrawal took place that night. The Germans attacked Rosières itself the following day aided by morning mist, but were held up, orders to the 1/7th DLI to retire were countermanded and it advanced against little or no opposition to re-occupy the Vauvillers Ridge. At 05.00 on 28 March the battalion was relieved and went back to the divisional concentration area at Caix. Fresh withdrawals on both flanks suddenly made this position critical, but the 1/7th DLI held on until 15.30, when it was moved to Caix Ridge, and then relieved by French troops at 18.00. The battalion then had its first rest for a week.Dunn, pp. 152–3. After the March battles, 50th Division was withdrawn to rest and refit near Douriez. Lieutenant-Colonel Vaux left the 1/7th DLI on 9 April on grounds of ill-health, having commanded the battalion since September 1911: almost three years' continuous service in command on the Western Front was a remarkable record for a pre-war TF officer. The battalion sometimes referred to itself as 'Vaux's Own'.Dunn, pp. 156–7.Wyrall, p. 305. The next German offensive (the Battle of the Lys began at Estaires on 9 April, and the 50th Division was sent to shore up the retreating 2nd Portuguese Division, 1/7th DLI clearing roads through shelled towns. Next day, A Company was sent to reinforce 1/6th DLI along the River Lawe. On 11 April the German pressure continued. B and C Companies were digging new positions, but soon fond themselves defending bridgeheads over the River Lys at Merville to cover the withdrawal of 1/6th Bn. Battalion HQ details were made up into a makeshift company, which successfully counter-attacked a German incursion. However, pressure on both flanks forced a withdrawal to the canal behind. The 50th Division was now extremely weak, but German offensive ran out of impetus, many of their troops getting out of hand and looting Merville. The attacks the following day (the Battle of Hazebrouck) were halted, and 1/7th DLI was relieved on the evening of 12 April.Dunn, pp. 158–64.Wyrall, pp. 309–34. The very weak 50th Division was sent to a 'quiet sector' along the Chemin des Dames on the French front to rest and recuperate, where it absorbed a draft of raw replacement troops. However, intelligence warned of impending attack, and on 27 May the next phase of the German Offensive opened on the Chemin des Dames ridge (the Third Battle of the Aisne). The front line was flattened by German artillery, and a party of the 1/7th DLI was sent up to reinforce 1/8th DLI as the attack developed. Almost all of 1/8th Bn and this party were killed or captured. Stragglers of 1/8th DLI rallied alongside 1/7th Bn's HQ and made another stand until surrounded, when they fought their way back. The remnants of the DLI Brigade and Pioneers now held Concevreux on the Aisne Canal until they were forced out and ended the day across the canal. Casualties had been very heavy, many taken PoW when their positions were overrun.Dunn, pp. 165–71.Wyrall, pp. 335–43. The following morning 8th and 25th Divisions held a position at Jonchery until forced back to Savigny. Here the survivors of 50th Division held the attackers off until French troops arrived, while a 60-strong party of 1/7th DLI made up from details at divisional HQ reinforced 25th Division. At the end of the battle, 50th Division was reduced to a single composite battalion.Dunn, pp. 171–7.Wyrall, pp. 344–9. After the Battle of the Aisne, 50th Division's infantry battalions were reduced to training cadres, and the division was eventually reconstituted with units from other theatres of the war. 1/7th Durham Light Infantry was transferred to 8th Division, where it absorbed that division's existing pioneer battalion, the 22nd DLI.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 89–95.Dunn, p. 177.Wyrall, p. 359. Hundred Days After reorganisation, 8th Division moved to the Arras sector, where the pioneers worked on trenches and railways while the division was engaged in the Battle of the Scarpe in August. A number of casualties were suffered from German Mustard Gas shelling. The division was engaged in diversionary attacks in September.Dunn, pp. 180–2.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 18, 28. By October the Allied Hundred Days Offensive was in full swing, and the 8th Division participated in the forcing of the Rouvroy–Fresnes Line (7–8 October).Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 227, 244. The pioneers' role was to follow the division and improve the roads around Fresnes, many of which were damaged by delayed- action mines. The Germans began to retreat from their positions on 18 October, and the pursuit through Lens and Douai was slowed by road and bridge demolitions that the pioneers had to repair, sometimes under shell or machine- gun fire. Booby traps also caused casualties and work for the pioneers. 8th Division was relieved on the night of 4/5 November, and the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November, while the battalion was marching into Tournai behind the front-line troops.Dunn, pp. 182–8.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 345, 348. After the Armistice, the battalion colours were taken out of St Paul's Church, Hendon, and handed over to Lt-Col Vaux at a parade on 16 December attended by 300 wounded, discharged or repatriated members of the battalion. The colour party consisted almost entirely of men who had landed with the battalion in April 1915, and they took the colours to Belgium to join the 1/7th Bn.Dunn, pp. 190–2. After re-establishing civilian infrastructure at Tournai, the battalion moved with the Division to Ath in December. Demobilisation proceeded rapidly, with mineworkers among the first to be sent home. Others were sent to reinforce battalions of the DLI selected for the Army of Occupation. The cadre of the battalion returned to Sunderland under the command of Lt-Col Birchall on 20 June 1919 and was disembodied on 26 June.Dunn, pp. 189–8=95. Commanding Officers The following officers commanded 7th and 1/7th battalions during World War I:Dunn, Appendix 4. * Lt- Col Ernest Vaux, CMG, DSO, 11 September 1911 to 9 April 1918 * Acting Lt-Col A.H Birchall, MC 9 April to July 1918 * Lt-Col B.C. James, DSO, (Devonshire Regiment) July to 2 September 1918 * Major J.P. Turcan from 2 September 1918Dunn,p. 181. * Lt-Col A.H Birchall at demobilisationDunn, p. 193. =2/7th Battalion= The battalion was formed at Sunderland on 14 September 1914.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 49–54. The 2nd Line TF units of the Northumbrian Division assembled around Newcastle upon Tyne, where 2nd Northumbrian Divisional HQ opened in January 1915. The 2nd DLI Brigade was at Leam Camp, Heworth. By May 1915, all the brigade's Home Service men had been transferred to form 23rd Provisional Bn (later 26th DLI) serving in coast defence and thenceforth the 2nd Line units had the role of training drafts for the 1st Line serving in France. While under training they were responsible for defending the stretch of coast from Seaham Harbour through Sunderland to Newcastle. The 2nd Northumbrian Division was numbered 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division and the DLI became 190th (2nd Durham Light Infantry) Brigade on 16 August. In November 1915 the division moved into winter quarters around York and Doncaster.63 Division at Long, Long Trail.10th Provisional Brigade War Diary, The National Archives, Kew file WO 95/5458.Porter63 Division at Regimental Warpath. Early in 1916, 63rd Division was still seriously under strength, and the decision was made to break it up. Its number and ancillary units were transferred to the Royal Naval Division, veterans of Antwerp and Gallipoli, now arriving on the Western Front.Becke, Part 3b, pp. 117–28. 190th Brigade remained in existence, supplying drafts to the first line in France, until 29 November 1916, when the 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/8th DLI left to form 214th Bde in 71st Division, a new home service division forming in southern England, with 214th Bde at Andover.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 101-5.71 Division at Regimental Warpath. In October, 214th Bde was redesignated 214th Special Bde and filled with men of A1 medical category for overseas service. The brigade was intended to go to Murmansk in North Russia, but this never happened and most of the men were drafted as reinforcements to the Western Front in March 1918 after the German Spring Offensive.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75–82. 71st Division in turn was broken up on 12 February 1918 and 214th Brigade left to join 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division. The division moved to East Anglia, with 214th Bde at Colchester.67 Division at Regimental Warpath. North Russia Most of 67th Division was composed of training battalions but 2/7th DLI was still formally a 2nd Line TF battalion, and a year after initially being selected to form part of the Allied expedition to North Russia it finally went there as a garrison battalion. It entrained at Colchester for Glasgow on 5 October 1918, embarking on HM Transport Goentoer the following day and disembarking at Arkhangelsk on 24 October under the command of Lt-Col W.J. Bowker, CMG, DSO. One detachment (seven officers and 244 other ranks) went to relieve US and White Russian troops guarding stores at Bakaritza. A second detachment (eight officers and 232 ORs) relieved French troops at Constantine Barracks across the Northern Dvina River at Solombala. The third detachment (two officers and 100 men) was at the Detention Barracks at Arkhangelsk and Battalion HQ was established at the Bar Hotel, Arkhangelsk, later at Bakatriza.Overseas Garrisons at Regimental Warpath.Dunn, pp. 197–200. Apart from guard duties, the battalion carried out raids on outlying villages in search of stolen weapons and stores. On 11 December the White Russian 1st Arkhangelsk Regiment mutinied and all guards were increased. The Solombala detachment was given the task of guarding the ammunition dump and mutiny ringleaders, and escorting the rest of the mutineers to a ship for detention. Several arson attacks on RE and Royal Army Service Corps stores led to firefighting and increased guard duties. The first draft of demobilised men left the battalion on 17 June 1919. On 29 August only four officers and 226 ORs of the battalion remained in Russia, and these were embarked for home shortly afterwards. This cadre was disbanded at Ripon on 13 September. During the war, 2/7th Bn had suffered 26 deaths (10 while in Russia, mostly from pneumonia and influenza). Commanding officers The following officers commanded 2/7th Bn during the North Russia expedition: * Lt-Col W.J. Bowker, CMG, DSO * Lt-Col T.C.B. Holland from 3 March 1919 * Maj R.A. Swan, OBE (Essex Regiment) from 23 May 1919 =3/7th Battalion= The 3/7th Bn DLI was formed at Sunderland on 18 June 1915 to supply drafts to the 1/7th Bn. It moved to Catterick Camp as part of the Northumbrian Reserve Group and was renamed the 7th Reserve Bn DLI on 18 April 1916. It was absorbed into 5th Reserve Bn on 1 September 1916.TF Training Bns at Regimental Warpath. Interwar When the TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 (and reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921) the 7th DLI reformed at the drill hall in Livingstone Road. Once again it was in 151st (DLI) Brigade of 50th (Northumbrian) Division, and Lt-Col Birchall returned as CO.Dunn, p. 201.Titles and Designations, 1927. In the coal strike of April 1921 a Defence Force was formed, with one unit being raised from the officers and 90 ORs of 7th DLI. It quickly reached a strength of 680 men and was stationed at Whitburn, South Tyneside, to guard the docks and the oil stores on the River Tyne. This lasted for three months during the political crisis.Dunn, p. 202. The 7th DLI opened a new drill hall at Dykelands Road, Seaburn, on 23 April 1923. This is still in use as an Army Reserve Centre.Dunn, p. 210. TA infantry battalions were reorganised in 1930, when D Company was converted into a machine gun company equipped with eight Vickers guns; from 1933 it was designated Support (or S) Company.Dunn, pp. 211–2. =47th (DLI) AA Battalion= 90 cm 'Projector Anti-Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth During the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA units. On 10 December 1936, 7th DLI was converted to 47th (DLI) AA Battalion, RE, a searchlight (S/L) unit of the Royal Engineers (RE). Battalion HQ remained at Sunderland, and the four companies were redesignated 386–389 AA Companies, with 389 based at South Shields. New permanent instructors were appointed from the RE and a group of officers and NCOs was temporarily attached to 31st (City of London Rifles) AA Bn, which had already undergone conversion. The new battalion formed part of 30 (Northumbrian) AA Group, also based in Sunderland, within 2 AA Division.Frederick, pp. 859, 868.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 110, 114.Dunn, p. 213.Dunn, p. 214.2nd AA Division at British Military History World War II =Mobilisation= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. 47th (DLI) AA Battalion now formed part of 43 AA Brigade in a new 7 AA Division that was being organised to take over the defence of North East England. 43 AA Brigade, consisting of one heavy AA gun regiment and three S/L units converted from DLI battalions, had the role of covering the industrial areas of Teesside and Middlesbrough.7 AA Division 1939 at British Military History. AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesRoutledge, Table LX, p. 378. =47th (DLI) Searchlight Regiment= On 1 August 1940 all the converted S/L units were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) as 'regiments' and their companies were redesignated 'batteries'. The battalion therefore became 47th (Durham Light Infantry) Searchlight Regiment, RA.Litchfield, p. 56–7.Farndale, Annex M.47 S/L Rgt at RA 39–45. During the early part of the Battle of Britain, German day and night air raids and mine laying began along the East Coast of England, intensifying through June 1940. Thereafter the Luftwaffe concentrated on Royal Air Force sites in the South of England, with occasional raids on the North East.Routledge, Table LXII, pp. 379–80. Blitz Formation sign of 7 AA Division. The Battle of Britain was followed by the Luftwaffe 's night Blitz on London and other industrial cities during the winter of 1940–41. Again, NE England escaped the worst of this, but hundreds of people died during the Newcastle Blitz and there were notable air raids on Tyneside on 9 April and Sunderland on 25 April.Basil Collier, Appendices XXX and XXXI.Routledge, pp. 387–404. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 235th S/L Training Rgt at Ayr where it provided the basis for a new 558 S/L Bty formed on 13 February 1941. This battery later joined a newly-forming 92nd S/L Rgt.Frederick, p. 862. The S/L layouts had initially been based on a spacing of , but due to equipment shortages this had been extended to by September 1940. In November this was changed to clusters of three lights to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced apart. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with Searchlight Control (SLC) radar and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply.Routledge, pp. 388-9, 393.Pile's despatch. The main Blitz ended in May 1941, but occasional raids continued. 47th (DLI) S/L Regiment remained in 43 AA Bde in 7 AA Division until late 1941 when it transferred to 57th Light AA Bde in the same division.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 397.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80. =112th (DLI) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment= By this stage in the war, AA Command was suffering a critical shortage of Light AA gun (LAA) units, and had begun a process of converting some S/L units to the role.Routledge, p. 400. 47th (DLI) was one of the regiments chosen for conversion, becoming 112th (DLI) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in January 1942, with four LAA batteries numbered 364–367.Frederick, pp. 805, 837.112 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. After training, the regiment joined 5 AA Bde covering the Severn Valley in 9 AA Division at the beginning of April and then briefly transferred to 61 AA Bde at Swansea in the same division in May before becoming unbrigaded by mid-June. On 10 July, 367 LAA Bty left the regiment and joined a newly-formed 140th LAA Rgt, which served on in AA Command until it was disbanded in March 1945.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81. In August 1942, 112 (DLI) LAA Rgt joined 45 AA Bde. This was back in 9 AA Division, but at the end of September the AA Divisions were abolished and 45 AA Bde was assigned to a new 3 AA Group covering a wider area of South Wales and South West England. 364 LAA Battery was temporarily attached to 67 AA Bde in the West Midlands.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82. Bofors gun and crew, summer 1944. The AA defences of Southern England were severely tested in 1942 by the Luftwaffe's 'hit-and-run' attacks along the South Coast, and there was a pressing need for LAA guns.112th (DLI) LAA Rgt briefly reinforced 27 (Home Counties) AA Bde, 2 AA Group, in Southern England in October–November 1942. Afterwards it returned to 3 AA Group, first with 60 AA Bde, then back with 5 AA Bde by April 1943.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83. 112th (DLI) LAA Regiment left AA Command entirely at the end of May 1943 and joined the field force as part of GHQ Reserve.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, TNA files WO 212/9 and WO 33/1987. From now on the regiment was training for the planned Allied invasion of Europe (Operation Overlord) by 21st Army Group. The standard organisation for a mobile LAA regiment in the forthcoming campaign would be three batteries (54 guns) equipped with towed or Self-Propelled (SP) Bofors 40 mm guns.Routledge, p. 306. North West Europe The regiment's role in the forthcoming operations was to be a Corps LAA regiment, assigned to the HQ of one of the Army Corps, rather than as part of the main AA defences. It arrived in Normandy by 25 June.Routledge, Table XLIX, p. 319. After 21st Army Group's breakout from the beachhead there was a rapid advance across Northern France and Belgium, culminating in the attempt to seize Arnhem Bridge (Operation Market Garden). 112th (DLI) LAA Regiment caught up on 7 October, when it arrived to reinforce 100 AA Bde and defended the bridge at Grave,one of those captured in Market Garden. Enemy air attacks against these bridges were frequent, usually carried out by small groups of attackers at dawn and dusk. On 10 November the brigade was relieved of its bridge garrison commitments and moved up to support forward operations with VIII, XII and XXX Corps.Routledge, p. 325; Table LII, p. 332. Land Mattress rocket launcher (right) compared to the German Nebelwerfer (left) at the Canadian War Museum. 112th (DLI) LAA Regiment was given special roles by XII Corps in Operation Plunder, the assault crossing of the Rhine for which D-Day was 24 March 1945.Routledge, Table LVI, p. 365. 364 LAA Battery was hurriedly trained to operate 'Land Mattress' rocket projectors. These were Canadian-devised Multiple rocket launchers based on the Z Battery AA rocket launcher used by AA Command. 364 LAA Battery took part in the 'Pepperpot' of intense fire by every available gun and mortar (including AA guns) that supported the crossing of 15th (Scottish) Division.Routledge, pp. 353–7.Saunders, p. 147. The divisional historian describes the 'mad crescendo' of the Pepperpot, with the darkness criss-crossed by 'the vivid red of anti-aircraft and anti-tank and machine-gun tracer; the rushing, rending crash of the Mattresses'.Martin, p. 282. SP Bofors gun preparing to cross the Rhine with 15th (Scottish) Division. Meanwhile, the rest of the regiment was with 100 AA Bde providing close protection for XII Corps Royal Engineers' ferrying and bridging operations against enemy aircraft and swimmers.Saunders, p. 149. Soon after 15th (Scottish) Division established itself on the far bank, 15th (Kent) GHQ Troops Royal Engineers ferried across the first AA troops to defend the bridgehead, including two Troops of 112th (DLI) LAA Rgt, whose SP Bofors guns could just fit on a Class 9 raft. After dark on D-Day, Junkers Ju 88 bombers appeared and began making medium- and low-level dive-bombing attacks on the bridging operations, but 366 LAA Bty on the east bank and 113th (DLI) LAA Rgt on the West Bank dealt with these by firing 'radial zone' Bofors barrages using radar data; three enemy aircraft were shot down and others took evasive action. Similar attacks continued over successive nights until 27 March. There was some scattered daylight raiding by Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers on 28 March, but thereafter the Rhine crossings remained quiet as the Luftwaffe fell back in the face of 21st Army Group's rapid advance.Routledge, pp. 357–60.Pakenham-Walsh, pp. 486–7. During the final weeks of the war, 112th (DLI) LAA Rgt was 'grounded', confined to acting as a transport pool, guarding PoWs, and clearing the area around the Rhine battlefields of abandoned equipment and ammunition.Routledge, p. 361. Postwar =61 LAA Regiment= When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, 112th (DLI) LAA Rgt with its three remaining batteries (364, 365, 366) was placed in suspended animation. The war-raised personnel then reformed the regiment and batteries in the Regular Army with the same numbers. On 1 April, this regiment was redesignated 61 LAA Regiment with the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 726–7, 954.60–67 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. * 364 LAA Bty – disbanded to resuscitate 11 Bty unlinked from 2/11 Medium Bty in 3rd Medium Rgt as 156 LAA Bty * 365 LAA Bty – disbanded to resuscitate 21 Bty unlinked from 20/21 Medium Bty in 5th Medium Rgt as 157 LAA Bty * 366 LAA Bty – disbanded to resuscitate 10 Bty from 6/10 Medium Bty in 3rd Medium Rgt as 162 LAA Bty 61 LAA Regiment was converted into 61 LAA/SL Rgt on 1 June the same year, and together with 156, 157 and 162 LAA Btys placed in suspended animation on 1 May 1948 (though some of the battery numbers were later resuscitated). =582 (DLI) LAA Regiment= Meanwhile the TA elements of 112nd (DLI) LAA Rgt reformed on 1 January 1947 at Sunderland as 582 (The Durham Light Infantry) Light Anti- Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, RA. Initially, it formed part of 92 (AA) Army Group, Royal Artillery, (AGRA) in Western Command, but this AGRA was disbanded the following year.Frederick, p. 1024.564–591 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.AGRAs at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA. On 1 January 1954 the regiment absorbed 325 (Sunderland) LAA Rgt, and the following year, on the disbandment of AA Command, the regiment amalgamated with 463 (Durham) Heavy AA Regiment, RA, to form 463 (7 DLI) LAA/SL Rgt, with P and Q Batteries drawn from the former 582 Rgt.Frederick, p. 1014.Litchfield, pp. 55–61.444–473 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. The new regiment was part of 42 AGRA, formed from 69 AA Bde (the former 43 AA Bde, in which the regiment had served in the early years of World War II).Routledge, Table LXXV, p. 442. There was a further round of mergers in the TA in 1961, with 463 LAA Rgt absorbing two other County Durham RA units: 437 LAA Rgt at West Hartlepool and 885 Locating Battery at Darlington. (437 LAA Rgt had originally been 5th DLI, which had been converted into two S/L regiments in 43 AA Bde in 1938.) The newly merged regiment was going to take the subtitle 'Durham', but this was quickly changed to 'Durham Light Infantry'. RHQ and R Btys came from 463 LAA, P and Q Btys from 437 LAA. In 1964 the LAA designation was updated to 'Light Air Defence'.414–443 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. =County of Durham Regiment= When the TA was reduced to the Territorial Army and Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) in 1967, 463 (Durham Light Infantry) LAD Rgt became the bulk of the County of Durham Regiment, RA, with the following organisation:266–288 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.County of Durham Rgt at Regiments.org. * RHQ at Sunderland – from 463 (DLI) LAD Rgt * P (1st Durham) Bty at Hebburn – from 274 (Northumbrian) Field Rgt * Q (5DLI) Bty at West Hartlepool – from 463 (DLI) LAD Rgt * R (7DLI) Bty at Sunderland – from 463 (DLI) LAD Rgt However, many TAVR units were reduced to cadres in 1969, including the County of Durham Rgt. P Battery returned to become a Troop in 205 (3rd Durham Volunteer Artillery) Battery while the DLI parts of the regiment joined 72 Engineer Rgt, RE, in which part of R Bty formed a Troop of 118 Field Squadron at Sunderland.Tyne Electrical Engineers at Regiments.org. The TAVR was expanded again in 1971, and the cadre of the County of Durham Rgt formed A (Durham Royal Artillery) Battery at Hordern in a new regiment, the Northumbrian Volunteers.Northumbrian Volunteers at Regiments.org. This battalion in turn was broken up in 1975, with A (Durham Royal Artillery) and E (6th/8th DLI) Companies transferring to 7th Battalion, The Light Infantry, thus reuniting all the former Volunteer units of the DLI in one battalion.6th/8th Bn DLI at Regiments.org. Insignia Upon conversion to artillery, the officers, warrant officers and senior NCOs of the 47th S/L Rgt wore green Lanyards in place of the RA's white, to denote the unit's DLI ancestry. This tradition was continued postwar by 582 and 463 LAA/SL Rgts. Honorary Colonel The following served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * Edward Temperley Gourley appointed 10 July 1869; he later reverted to active command of the battalion and was re-appointed Hon Colonel on 19 January 1881.Dunn, p. 11. * Col Thomas Reed, former CO, appointed 22 November 1905 * George William Hamilton-Russell, 9th Viscount Boyne, appointed 26 April 1913 * Lt-Col Ernest Vaux, CMG, DSO, VD, appointed 20 May 1922, died 21 November 1925Dunn, pp. 208–9. * Lt-Col J. Spain, TD, served with the battalion from 1898 to 1921, invalided after 2nd Battle of Ypres, later commanded 6th DLI, died 12 March 1935 * Col William Basil Greenwell, CB, DSO, a former Regular DLI officer, appointed 10 July 1937Greenwell at DLI Medal Collection * Col Sir Robin Chapman, 2nd Baronet, CBE, TD, appointed 1 April 1967 Memorials After World War I the 7th DLI subscribed towards the cost of the DLI Memorial Chapel at Durham Cathedral.IWM War Memorials Register ref 10230.Dunn, p. 204. There is a board inscribed with the WWI Roll of Honour of the 7th DLI and a brass memorial plate to senior NCOs of the battalion at the Army Reserve Centre at Dykelands Road, Sunderland. There is also a plaque to the battalion in Saint George's Memorial Church, Ypres.Dunn, pp. 213–4. The old colours of the Sunderland Volunteer Infantry were in the DLI Regimental Museum, (now closed). The colours of the 7th DLI are at Bishop Auckland Army Reserve Centre.Dunn, pp. 220–1. A member of the battalion painted the incident of the men standing up at Bellewaarde to avoid the gas and singing Abide with Me. The painting, entitled The Miracle of Ypres, is in the possession of the Vaux family.Dunn, p. 67. Footnotes Notes References * Maj A.F.

They were led by head coach Kevin Donley, who served his 20th year as the first and only head coach in the history of Saint Francis football. The Cougars played their home games at Bishop John D'Arcy Stadium and were members of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA) Mideast League (MEL). The Cougars finished an undefeated regular season as the defending national champions. They finished 1st in the MSFA MEL division and received an automatic bid to the NAIA playoffs. The 2017 postseason saw the Cougars return to the national championship game. They successfully defended their national title with a 24-13 victory over Reinhardt (GA). The back-to-back championships is a feat that was completed for only the 5th time in NAIA football history. The undefeated season was the first in the Cougars' 20-year history.  Schedule  (14-0 overall, 6-0 conference) Game summaries 9/2/2017 - The #1-ranked Cougars opened their title defense with a road victory over Jamestown (ND). Saint Francis scored the first four times the offense touched the ball on their way to a 55-7 victory. 9/9/2017 - The Cougars returned home to defend their national championship against the like-named St. Francis Fighting Saints. Saint Francis (IN) won the game over St. Francis (IL), 68-23. The Cougars' clicked for 574 yards of total offense, including 301 net passing yards by Nick Ferrer, 120 yards rushing by Justin Green, and 111 receiving yards by Rocky James. Ferrer threw for 5 touchdowns, including 3 to James. Green rushed for 2 touchdowns in a game that also featured a blocked field goal that was returned for a Cougar touchdown. The Cougars took the opening kickoff and marched downfield to score and open a 7-0 lead. The Fighting Saints responded with a field goal to cut the lead to 7-3. But from that point, the home team controlled the game as their lead expanded to 48-9 at the half and 61-9 early in the fourth quarter. With second- and third-team players on the field, the Fighting Saints scored twice in the final quarter. After they returned a pass for 39 yards and a score, they successfully completed an on-side kick. Two plays later, the Saints' quarterback tossed a 49-yard pass to score for the second time in only 36 seconds. 9/16/2017 - The Cougars took to the road for their first game of the season against a ranked opponent. Saint Francis prevailed over St. Ambrose, 49-21, in a game highlighted by a record-setting performance by QB Nick Ferrer. Ferrer threw for six touchdowns to become the all-time leader in career TD passes thrown by a USF quarterback. He finished the game with a career-best 508 yards passing, completing 31 of 43 passes to ten different receivers without throwing an interception. Justin Green added 162 yards rushing to a total offensive effort of 686 yards. 9/23/2017 - A rare football oddity was witnessed by the fans who attended the Saint Francis homecoming game. Three different punt snaps went out of the end zone. The tree safeties gave the Cougars the equivalent of another touchdown, points not needed as the Cougars won the game, 48-23, over the visiting 11th- ranked Cougars from Saint Xavier. The game was never in doubt as Saint Francis raced to a 25-0 lead to start the scoring. 9/30/2017 - The Cougars faced their stiffest challenge this year as they went on the road to visit conference rival Marian University. Marian opened the game with a challenge to the Cougars, scoring on their first 3 possessions to take early leads of 14-0 and 17-3. Each of the Knights' drives included a quick-striking offense, with plays of 45+ yards highlighting each drive. But the Cougar defense steadied itself, holding Marian to 7 points the rest of the way, including a scoreless second half. Saint Francis scored the last points of the game to give them their only lead with less than 7 minutes to play in the final quarter. When the scoreboard finally reached zero, Saint Francis had emerged with a 31-24 victory. The score was tied at 17, and then again at 24 before USF scored the decisive points. The Saint Francis offense tallied 530 yards of total offense, including 403 yards and 3 TDs passing by Nick Ferrer. Ferrer completed 33 of 38 attempts without an interception. Favored targets were Rocky James, with 12 receptions for 163 yards, and Dan Ricksy, with 10 receptions for 146 yards. Justin Green added 138 yards of rushing. The Cougars won the time-of- possession battle, 41 minutes to 19, due in part to the quick strikes of the Marian offense in the first half. With the victory, the Cougars set a new team record for their 14th consecutive victory. The victory also sent the Franciscan Bowl trophy to Fort Wayne for the next year, with the series becoming tied, 1-1. 10/7/2017 - Something had to give. Unbeaten Concordia was visiting unbeaten Saint Francis, and the conference lead was on the line. Concordia brought one of the top defenses, and they brought one of the nation's leading rushers too. The game lived up to expectations as Saint Francis won, 35-18, in a game that was much closer than the final score indicated. Concordia won the total yardage game, 375-367, out-rushing USF 243-157. Concordia's Joe Conner outgained Justin Green, 189-154. USF won the passing, 210-132. Concordia scored first, and the game was back and forth before the Cougars pulled away in the 4th quarter to seal the victory. USF scored 4 touchdowns: 3 by Green rushes, and one via a 46-yard fumble recovery by Ryan Johnson, in addition to 3 field goals. The no passing-TD game ended a streak of consecutive games with 2 or more TD passes by QB Nick Ferrer, who left the game briefly in the second half with a hand injury. 10/14/2017 - The Cougars continued their mid-season playoff-like schedule with their fourth game in a row against a ranked or tough opponent. The Cougars went on the road to face another conference unbeaten, the Siena Heights Saints, winners of their previous four games. It was Homecoming and Senior Night for the Saints. But the Cougars served notice early when Justin Green broke a 57-yard TD run on the first drive of the game. For the night, Green would end up with three scores and 142 net yards rushing. A strong defensive effort by the Cougars contributed to a Saint Francis victory. The final score was 36-9. A steady rain / drizzle made for messy play in the first half, and the Cougars' defense held Siena Heights to a safety earned when the Saints blocked a punt attempt that sent the ball out of the back of the end zone. A halftime lead of 20-2 was expanded to the final score as the Cougars scored two touchdowns and a matching safety of their own. 10/21/2017 - After a series of ranked and tough opponents, the Cougars finally caught a breather with a road trip to St. Louis to meet conference opponent Missouri Baptist. The Cougars looked erratic at times but came away with a victory, by a final score of 56-23. At one point in the first half, Saint Francis led by a single point, 21-20, after Missouri Baptist failed an attempted two-point conversion. The Cougars scored 35 of the final 38 points in the contest. USF quarterback Nick Ferrer threw for six touchdowns to move into first place for career touchdown passes by a quarterback in the MidStates Football Association. In this game, Ferrer completed 33 of 49 passes with one interception and 446 yards. Justin Green rushed for 169 yards as the Cougars accumulated 686 yards of total offense. Ferrer threw pass completions of 27 yards or more to 5 different receivers, with 5 different targets hauling in the 6 touchdown passes. On defense, the Cougars held Mo. Baptist to a net gain of 5 yards rushing on 25 carries, derived from gains of 49 yards offset by rushes resulting in 44 yards of losses. 10/28/2017 - Today's game matched the undefeated and #1-ranked USF Cougars against the winless conference foes from Lindenwood-Belleville. The Cougars boasted the top-ranked offense in the MSFA, and the Lynx brought the worst-ranked defense to town. Also, the Cougars placed their top-ranked defense against the MSFA's worst-rated offense. The outcome was predictable; the only thing in doubt was the final score. In hindsight, the Cougars needed only 13 seconds to settle the matter. Matt Kominkiewicz ran back the opening kickoff for a touchdown and a quick 7-0 lead. When the final seconds had ticked off the clock, USF won with a 70-0 shutout over the visitors. In addition to the opening play, highlights in the game were: 3 touchdown passes by Nick Ferrer, 3 touchdown runs by Justin Green, and 2 pick-6 interceptions returned for a score (the first being a goal-line to goal-line return of 100 yards by Spencer Cowherd, and the second being a 45-yard return by Kaleb Summers). Kominkiewicz also had a 2-touchdown game as he was on the receiving end of a TD pass from Clay Senerius. During the game, Ferrer became #2 on the career yardage list for MSFA quarterbacks. He passed former Cougar QB Jeremy Hibbeln as he became the all-time leader in yardage by a Saint Francis QB. 11/04/2017 - Today was Senior Day for the class of 2017. Playing a home game against their rivals from just down interstate I-69, USF prevailed 40-20 over the Taylor University Crusaders. The game opened with USF's Justin Green returning the opening kick 96 yards for a touchdown. This was the second consecutive game where a USF returner scored on the opening kick. But Taylor quickly responded with an 80-yard drive of their own. Taylor actually took a 7-6 lead because USF failed to convert the kick after their score. From that point, the Cougars took over. The lead swelled to 40-7 as Green scored three more times. With the four touchdowns, Green established a new Cougar single- season record for touchdowns: it was his 22nd of the year. Two 4th-quarter scores by Taylor created the final score. Saint Francis was in control the whole way, though their offense was stopped by 4 turnovers - 3 fumbles lost and 1 interception. With the win today, USF reached one goal for the season: completing an undefeated season and carrying their #1 ranking from preseason and into the playoffs. With a bye week next week, USF will be the #1 seed in the playoffs. 11/18/2017 - The Cougars opened the playoff season with a rain- soaked game against the Benedictine Ravens. This was the first match-up between the two winningest active coaches in NAIA football. Because of lightning and solid heavy rainfall, the start of the game was pushed back from a 12:00 noon intended kickoff to a 6:00pm game played under the lights. The weather impacted the high-powered offense of both teams; the game saw a total of 8 fumbles and 1 interception. The game was close throughout, and in the end Saint Francis prevailed 26-21. The Cougars took the opening kick-off and drove for a quick 6-0 lead. The extra point attempt was blocked. That was the only score for the Cougars in the first half. The Ravens scored twice in the 2nd quarter, including a 51-yard pass that set up the second score with only 10 seconds remaining in the half. Saint Francis responded quickly and explosively, taking the opening kick and returning it for an 86-yard touchdown by Justin Green. The TD return was the third by the Cougars in the last 3 games. In addition to the kick-off return, Green scored 1 TD as he rushed for 191 yards. For his effort, Green was named the Offensive Player of the Game. Defensive honors went to Ryan Johnson, whose solid play included breaking up 3 pass plays. 11/25/2017 - The Cougars returned to the playing field in a quarterfinal match vs. the 10th-ranked Red Raiders from Northwestern College (IA). The visitors came in with only 1 loss, at the hands of perennial playoff power Morningside College.Both teams sported highly ranked defenses and offenses that were capable of scoring plenty of points. In the end, the Cougars rose to the occasion. The Cougars won the coin toss and elected to receive. The opening kickoff sailed through the end zone for a touchback. The USF offense then patiently and methodically possessed the ball as they drove the ball 75 yards for a score that would prove to be all the points they would need. The defense had three pass interceptions and 1 fumble recovery. The final score was 30-3. Justin Green scored twice, one by pass and one by run. Dan Ricksy caught 2 touchdown passes. For his effort, Ricksy was named the Offensive Player of the Game. The defensive honor went to Eric Dunten. The game marked another milestone victory for Cougars and their head coach Kevin Donley. The win was the 200th victory in the 20th season of the program, all under the leadership of Donley as head coach. 12/02/2017 - The Cougars were home to host the #3-ranked Morningside Mustangs for the right to travel to Daytona Beach and the NAIA Football National Championship. The two undefeateds were similar in makeup, with each sporting a passing quarterback, a leading rusher, and a stingy defense. The contest was hard fought, and the Cougars emerged with a 43-36 win. The two teams traded punts before Saint Francis marched the field for the first of three consecutive TD drives that gave them a 19-3 advantage at the end of the 1st quarter. The extra point kick was good, and the Cougars led 7-0. Ironically, that was the only PAT the Cougars were to score on the day. Throughout the afternoon, USF would score 6 additional TDs. But injured kicker Gavin Gardner was unable to return to the game, and Saint Francis missed 5 straight 2-point conversions before trying a failed kick attempt after their final score. On the other hand, Morningside converted 2 field goal attempts and 2 2-point conversions to give them a decided advantage in the kicking output. Saint Francis led the entire game except for a brief point in the 4th quarter when the Mustangs took a 28-25 lead. The lead reverted to USF when Justin Green broke through the line for a 61-yard TD run just 3 plays and 1:08 later. For the second straight game, USF QB Nick Ferrer was outgained in passing yardage. Morningside QB Trent Solsma was 28 for 53, for a total of 406 yards. He had 1 interception that was returned for a TD. Ferrer threw less frequently, going 19 for 31 for 267 yards. Cougar rusher Justin Green was the game's leading rusher, netting 234 yards on 244 yards of gains offset by 10 yards of losses. This effort outperformed the NAIA's leading rusher, the Mustangs' RB Bubba Jenkins, who gained a net of 73 yards on 24 rushing attempts, or just over 3.0 yards/attempt. Both QBs threw for 3 TDs, and Green added 3 rushing TDs. For this contribution, Green was once again named the Offensive Player of the Game. The Defensive award had two recipients, Wilmer Cole and Eric Hemmelgarn. On an unrelated note, it was Hemmelgarn who took over the kickoff duties after Gardner was unable to perform. 12/16/2017 - The Cougars returned to the national championship title game with an undefeated record of 13-0. Their opponent was Reinhardt (GA), a team they had faced and defeated in each of the previous two postseasons. Led by the NAIA Player of the Year, quarterback Nick Ferrer, the Cougars completed the undefeated season by defeating the Eagles 24-13. The completion of back- to-back national championships was only the 5th time that feat had been performed in NAIA football history. The Cougars broke out early, leading 17-0 after the 1st quarter. They extended the lead to 24-0 in the 2nd quarter before Rhinehardt scored to set the halftime score at 24-7. The second half was a defensive battle, with Rhinehardt tallying the only points on a TD and blocked extra point attempt. Highlights of the game were Justin Green rushed for 144 yards on 24 carries, with 2 TDs scored including one on an 80-yard dash in the first quarter; Nick Ferrer passed for 270 yards and 1 TD on 19 of 30 passes without an interception; Duke Blackwell received 5 passes for 96 yards and a TD before leaving the game with an injury; Eric Dunten with 17 tackles, 10 of them unassisted; and Piercen Harnish with 16 tackles, 6 of them unassisted. From these performers, Justin Green was named Offensive Player of the Game, and Eric Dunten was named the Defensive Player of the Game. National awards and honors * Senior quarterback Nick Ferrer was named as the 2018 NAIA Football Player of the Year. This was the third time in Cougar football history that one of their players received the award.

He received higher education and was able to write in Classical Chinese. He was good at writing poems, prose and calligraphy. After reaching adulthood, he was put in charge of his own fief in Horqin. During the Xinhai revolution, Amurlingkui and other Mongol noblemen organized the league of Mongol princes supporting the house of Aisin- Gioro. However, after Yuan Shikai took over the power, the Mongol noblemen turned their support to Yuan instead. With the fall of Qing dynasty, he became a senator in the provisional senate of republic of China and a member of the political council. He also participated in the second congress of republic of China. He died in the year of 1930. His son Heshig inherited the Jasagh status but lost the title of prince. The later years of Amurlingkui was troubled by economic crisis of his family. Taxes can no longer be collected from the peasants of his fief, salaries from the congress were not sufficient to support his many relatives. He eventually had to sell his mansion in Beijing in order to relief himself from the plight.

The song was released in 1998 during the 1998 legislative election and was frequently used during the campaign of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). It became the party's anthem. A video for the song was released the same year. The song was composed by Ondřej Hejma. \\"Modrá je dobrá\\" was later re-released in 2001 on the album Čínská otázka (Chinese Question). This version was recorded in Chinese. Political use of the song \\"Modrá je dobrá\\" was inspired by the Donovan song \\"Colours\\". Hejma didn't intend it to be a political song even though he was upset about the Sarajevo assassination; he did predict it would become the anthem of the Civic Democratic Party. The song became popular after its release and some prominent members of the Civic Democratic Party asked Hejma if they could use it during their campaign.

A child prodigy, he studied at the Falcón Conservatory in Havana, where he was awarded the title \\"professor of piano\\" at age 14. During the 1920s, he toured the US and appeared in Europe. During the 1930s, he was a featured soloist with orchestras in the US and appeared under the batons of many distinguished conductors. Echániz joined the Eastman School faculty in 1944. Throughout his 25-year teaching career, Echániz maintained an active career as a recitalist in Europe, the US, and the Caribbean, as an orchestral soloist, and as a recording artist.  Early life  Echániz was born in the town of Guanabacoa on June 4, 1905. Echániz received his first piano lessons from his father, who was a professor at the Conservatorio Nacional Hubert de Blanck.

Last performance and death  Echániz had been scheduled to give his first New York recital in eleven years in December 1968, but on the night of the performance at Philharmonic Hall at New York's Lincoln Center, he was so ill from what was believed to be Hong Kong flu that he was able to perform only the first half of the program. All upcoming appearances were cancelled, including a scheduled Kilbourn Hall recital at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York state in celebration of his twenty-fifth anniversary. Instead, director of the school Walter Hendl gave a dinner in honor of Echániz at Hutchinson House, Rochester.Hutchinson House is the headquarters of the Rochester Arts Council, located on 930 East Street, Rochester, New York state.

The single example was a two- seat parasol-wing monoplane which entered two national competitions, served the Warsaw Academic Aeroclub and also towed an advertising banner. Design and development The Seckja Lotnicza (SL) or Aeronautical Section of Warsaw Technical University, set up in 1916 by Ryszard Bartel and revived in 1921, played a significant part in the growth of Polish club flying. The 1925 Drzewiecki JD-2 was the first of their powered aircraft designs to be built and the second, designed by SL members Stanislaw Rogalski and Stanislaw Wigura, was the R.W.1. Its construction in the SL workshop was funded by LOPP and they were helped by staff from the factory of E. Plage and T. Laśkiewicz. Its parasol wing was trapezoidal in plan and had an aerodynamically semi-thick section. It was built in two parts, each based on two spars. In front of the forward spar the wing was plywood-covered, with fabric aft. The two halves were joined centrally and held over the fuselage on a pair of transverse inverted-V cabane struts. On each side a pair of parallel struts from the spars to the lower fuselage longeron provided the primary wing bracing. The R.W.1 was powered by a Anzani 6 six-cylinder radial engine. Fuel tanks, together holding , were in the wing roots. Behind the engine fire wall the simple fuselage had a tapered, rectangular section, built around four longerons and frames and ply covered. It contained two open cockpits in tandem under the wing, fitted with dual control. The empennage was conventional with its tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and with a rounded vertical tail. The tail surfaces were built in a similar way to the wings and the rear control surfaces, like the ailerons, were unbalanced. The mainwheels of its fixed landing gear were on a single axle with rubber shock absorbers at each end and supported by steel V-struts from the lower longerons. There was a tailskid under the fin. It flew for the first time in about September 1927. Operational history Very soon after its first flight the R.W.1 competed in the First National Lightplane Contest, held in Warsaw in early October 1927. During this event the Anzani engine, which had a history of unreliability, failed, and the airframe was damaged in the subsequent emergency landing. After repair it was used by the Warsw Academic Aeroclub. In 1928 it generated some revenue for the club by acting as an air-advertisement tug for a coffee firm. In late October it took part in the Second National Lightplane Contest, again held at Warsaw. It qualified in twelfth place, but a take-off accident broke off the rear fuselage, after which the R.W.1 did not fly again. Its designers teamed up with Jerzy Drzewiecki, another Warsaw student, and some twenty-two designs were built under the joint RWD acronym.

In 2012, British theatre critic Michael Billington claimed that “modern theatre\\" is heavily dependent \\"on Jewish writers.” A significant proportion of British theatre artists, such as Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Peter Brook, Mike Leigh, Steven Berkoff, Patrick Marber, Nicholas Hytner, Sam Mendes, Jonathan Miller, Ryan Craig, Julia Pascal, Nina Raine, Diane Samuels, Shellley Silas or Gail Louw (see the List of British Jewish entertainers), are of Jewish cultural heritage, and thus ‘differently’ cultured. As Peter Lawson argues, Israel Zangwill's dramatization of his novel Children of the Ghetto (1899) is the first notable British-Jewish play, focused on immigration to the East End. The idea that there is a British-Jewish theatre emphasises the specific historical, ideological and institutional contexts and frameworks shaping Jewish-inflected theatre artists in Britain. Many of the Anglo-Jewish theatre or British-Jewish practitioners grew up in specifically Jewish environments (e.g.: Pinter, Kops, Wesker, Berkoff) to parents who were immigrants or first- generation British citizens. In these homes, Yiddish was often spoken and Hebrew read, different foods were cooked, different body languages seen, and the patterns of speech (often found in Pinter, Kops or Berkoff) were not quite British. British-Jewish theatre is shaped by specific historical, ideological and institutional contexts and frameworks, such as the role of still prevalent stereotypes and low-level anti-Semitism or the controversies around the Israeli-Palestine conflict.

He was known as a translator, philologist, and philosopher. He is best known for translations of Martin Heidegger, which caused mixed reactions among specialists. He lectured in authors' courses at the philosophy faculty of Moscow State University. Bibikhin undertook a sufficient number of translations to enable him to formulate his own theory of Europe. This theory consisted in part of a return to the past, and enlivening the most valuable achievements of the past culture.  Biography  Bibikhin graduated from Moscow State Linguistic University in 1967 and taught language and translation theory at both the MSLU and MGIMO University. At this time, he worked mainly on philosophy and literature and studied ancient languages under Andrey Zaliznyak. He completed his postgraduate study at the faculty of philosophy, MSU in 1977 by defending his candidate's thesis, entitled: \\"Semantic Potencies of the Linguistic Sign.\\" The themes included in his thesis were: 1) interrelations between word and world, 2) word and thought, 3) an approach to word and thought, 4) attempt to think of the ontological foundation of language. These theories were subsequently developed in a seminar called \\"Inner form of word\\" and in the courses \\"Language of Philosophy\\" and \\"L. Wittgenstein.\\" He worked as a secretary and assistant for Aleksei Losev, also recording several conversations with the philosopher. These recordings were later collected and published in the book \\"Aleksei Fedorovich Losev. Sergey Sergeyevich Averintsev.\\" (2004) Bibikhin was employed at the Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences in 1972 and served there until his death. He spent his last years working at the Centre of Methodology and Ethics of Science of the Philosophy of Science and Technology Branch of the Institute.Центр методологии и этики науки // Официальный сайт Института философии РАН. — 06.09.2009. He was a lecturer of Philosophy and member of the faculty of MSU from 1989 onward. He lectured in authors courses and held seminars at the Faculty of Philosophy of MSU from 1980 to 2004. He also lectured at St. Philaret's Christian Institute in Moscow and St. Thomas Institute. He was buried at Nikolo-Archangelski cemetery in Moscow.  Philosopher and lecturer  Bibikhin lectured in about twenty courses at MSU and other institutes. He wrote: 'Philosophy always went against the stream. With great risk... Philosophy is for the returning from doctrines to things; for recalling the early; for the ending of divination through words. There is a difference between philosophy and the sciences: they are building themselves, philosophy is called to reconstruct itself like a scaffolding after building the house.'Бибихин В. В. Слово и событие. — М.: Эдиториал УРСС, 2001. — С. 47, 20.(Russian original) Bibikhin believed philosophy was not an \\"intellectual activity,\\" nor a \\"scientific sphere\\" or a \\"cultural sphere,\\" and the philosophers' language is not a \\"construction,\\" or \\"information about the things\\" - rather, it is a 'preparation for the possibility of forming knowledge about things based on the last, utmost foundations'. To Bibikhin, Philosophy is an 'attempt — guaranteed by nothing – to give my life, human life, back the way it used to be at the very beginning: relation to the world, not to the picture, but to an event'.Бибихин В. В. Ранний Хайдеггер. Материалы к семинару. — М.: Институт философии, теологии и истории св. Фомы, 2009. — л. 15 — Серия «Bibliotheca Ignatiana». — (inexact translation) It is an attempt to let an event be in disinterested word, let it be the 'place where an event is shining, becoming a phenomenon, where all that exists is let to be as it really is, not controlled or placed on a register'. Heidegger's thought was essential to Bibikhin. In his four-term course \\"Early Heidegger\\" (1990s) Bibikhin read Heidegger's earliest works not as immature and preliminary, but as a commentary to his later writings. The course was mostly devoted, both in lecturers and seminars, to the reading and study of Heidegger's main work \\"Being and Time\\" (1927). Bibikhin's last seminars at the Institute of Philosophy and his last article were also dedicated to Heidegger.  Translator  Vladimir Bibikhin translated texts from Spanish, Italian, Latin, Greek, French, English, and German from 1967 onward. He wrote several papers and scientific reviews, as well as commentaries on translations and articles on the theory of translation (the best of them were subsequently included in the book \\"Word and Event\\"). Among others, Bibikhin translated the works of Iamblichus, John Amos Comenius, García Lorca, Giuseppe Mazzini, Petrarch, Nicholas of Cusa, St. Gregory Palamas, St. Macarius of Egypt, W. Heisenberg, Jean-Paul Sartre, Gabriel Marcel, Jacques Ellul, Eugène Ionesco, Antonin Artaud, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Gadamer, Wilhelm Dilthey, Hannah Arendt, and Jacques Derrida. Theological translations were published under the pseudonym V. Veneaminov.  Criticism  Bibikhin's views on philosophy of language were controversial, and were criticized by some professional philosophers and linguists. N. V. Motroshilova claimed Bibikhin had deliberately concealed Heidegger's closeness to the Nazis and ignored empirical evidence of his loyalty to the Nazi regime. She also noted the ambiguity of his \\"Being and Time\\" translation: 'But his translation of \\"Being and Time\\" is worthy of special conversation. This translation is quite interesting and valuable as an independent phenomenon, and as Bibikhin's work. But the point is that it is the first and the only 'presence' of \\"Time and Being\\" in Russian philosophic culture, in Russian language for now. And, unfortunately, (I've heard it from many teachers), the translation doesn't help but significantly hampers comprehension of that classic work of XX century. So I'd recommend the above-mentioned E. Borisov's translation to those just starting their mastery of Heidegger's philosophy - it is not \\"Being and Time\\", but Heidegger is there more intelligible and adequate'. Critics also complained of a distortion to Heidegger's works in Bibikhin's translations. For example, Aleksandr Dugin writes: 'It appears that Bibikhin and like-minded persons are really carried away by Heidegger, but there is nothing but that zeal in presentation of Heidegger. It's totally insufferable to read them because these texts say too much about conditions, efforts and sufferings of Bibikhin and his colleagues-translators, but there is almost nothing except for accidental coincidences, they say nothing about Heidegger or give the picture making one's hair stand on end.'Дугин А.

She and future governor George Ariyoshi met in 1953, and married in 1955. The couple are the parents of daughter Lynn and sons Todd and Donn. All of their children attended an afternoon Japanese language school in Hawaii, because George believed that being multi-lingual and understanding their cultural heritage would be an asset to them. First lady of Hawaii Continuing the Washington Place restoration efforts of her predecessor Beatrice Burns, Jean was given a budget of $85,000. Many of the historical pieces in the house had begun to deteriorate, and were subject to termites. She began to reclaim what items she could that had been purchased and removed by previous governors. Focusing on the rooms seen by the public, she restored a portrait of Liliʻuokalani in the dining room, and spent years bringing the house up to quality for public tours. She had every item catalogued by faculty members of the University of Hawaii, and part of the downstairs was turned into a museum. Docents were trained to conduct public tours. In 1985, Jean began the statewide \\"A Million Trees of Aloha\\" reforestation program in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the sugar industry, and the 100th anniversary of Japanese immigration. In response, various organizations and individuals contributed to the effort that resulted in 1,138,000 trees planted throughout the state.

As of December 2019, the podcast had produced 660 episodes. TJ Kirk announced the end of the Drunken Peasants on December 29, 2017 via his own YouTube channel and Twitter. On January 31, 2018, TJ Kirk announced that the show would continue with hosts Ben and Billy The Fridge. = Milo Yiannopoulos = In January, 2016, media personality Milo Yiannopoulos was a guest of the show. During the 3-hour long episode Yiannopoulos said that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can \\"happen perfectly consensually\\", as some children are sexually and emotionally mature enough to consent to sex with adults.Justin J. Rudnick. “Kevin Spacey's Coming Out and the Politics of Gay Victimhood.” QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, vol. 5, no. 2, 2018, pp. 66–71. JSTOR, In February 2017 the politically conservative blog The Reagan Battalion posted on Twitter a segment of the Drunken Peasants episode. Following widespread criticism of Yiannopoulos's comments, he was removed from his position as a speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference. In an interview with TJ Kirk on The Joe Rogan Experience, host Joe Rogan remarked to TJ Kirk that \\"Your podcast was the big podcast that kind of sunk Milo\\", to which Kirk commented that he had known what he had gotten himself into by inviting Yiannopoulos on the podcast, while also stating that the podcasts's impact on Yiannopoulos had been unintentional.  Format  Generally, Drunken Peasants episodes are anywhere from two to three hours in length. In December 2017, the podcast announced that future episodes would air on Mondays and Thursdays. In June 2018, the podcast instead announced that going forward their shows would be on Tuesdays and Saturdays. The Drunken Peasants is primarily a social and political commentary podcast. Video clips and news articles were often shown, with commentary made by the podcast's hosts towards said media taking up the majority of an episode's run-time. Episodes are typically divided into segments, such as Troll or Not a Troll, in which the hosts determine whether or not a content creator is an internet troll; Feminist Slam Poetry, in which the hosts criticize feminist poems; The Information Segment, in which a random article from Wikipedia was read; DP Action News, in which clips or articles from mainstream news outlets are discussed; Crazy People, in which videos of content creators are viewed and critiqued; Cutting the Fat, in which old, usually poorly-made videos of the hosts were viewed and mocked; and The Individual Brett Keane Segment Situation, in which videos or articles written by a born again Christian YouTuber named Brett Keane are mocked.

It is directed by Sidhant Sachdev. It is a love story that unfolds between a 26-year-old researcher Reyna Kapoor, at a Mumbai hospital, and her surgeon friend Shekhar, amidst mysterious and dark occurrences in her house. Plot The story begins with construction workers trying to uproot a tree, which causes a dead body to hang out of the tree. Postmortem reveals the body to be at least a year old and hence in very bad shape and it can't be identified. It is taken to a hospital. At night, the dead body opens its eyes, causing all lights in the hospital to explode. The story moves on to Reyna Kapoor (Sanjeeda Sheikh), who used to be an excellent surgeon ( according to her, surgery is her first love). An incident that happened in her life had caused her to get PTSD and hence she is unable to do surgeries. At the beginning of the series, she has recovered and is planning to take a test to confirm that she is ready to go back to surgery. But as she begins to take the test, a power outage occurs, with the lights exploding. The test is rescheduled for another week. Reyna meets with her friend Dr. Shekhar (Trishaan Singh Maini), who is shown to have the interest to pursue a relationship with her. When Reyna returns to her apartment, she experiences paranormal activity in the lift, scaring her. This occurs multiple days, with a ghost-like entity appearing and scaring her at times. She shares it with her friends Dr. Shekhar and Dr. Meghna who don't believe her and instead convinced her that she is hallucinating as a result of the high dosage medication she takes for her PTSD. Reyna meets a man Sahil Arora (Vatsal Seth) in the lift, who befriends her. He invites her to his home for coffee, where it is shown to the viewers that he keeps dead bodies in his fridge and drinks blood. Meanwhile, the haunting incidents surrounding Reyna increase and as no one believes her, she argues with her friends and asks them to stay away, which upsets them. Dr. Shekhar discusses his with Dr. Shetty who advises him to pretend as if he has believed Reyna, as it might help her cope better. So, Dr. Shekhar brings in a psychic Mukherjee (whom he had bribed to tell Reyna that there is nothing wrong with her or her house). Mukherjee sees the ghost, but on cue from Shekhar, tells Reyna that nothing was wrong, which relaxes her. Later, Mukherjee texts Shekhar about the presence of an entity in Reyna's home, which Shekhar ignores and warns Mukherjee to be quiet. Reyna asks Shekhar out on a dinner date and reveals that she is finally ready to commit. Before she could propose to Shekhar, she goes to the washroom to prepare herself, where she receives a call from the ghost (shown to be Sahil) who warns her not to believe Shekhar. He also asks her to check Shekhar's phone, which scares her. Then she goes to meet with Shekhar and checks his phone about conversation him and Mr. Mukherjee when he is called away on an issue about his car. She finds out that he hid the truth from her. Then she goes to her apartment where she meets Sahil and Sahil informs her that there is a spirit in her house and tells her that for her safety, she needs to stay away from that house. This way they can find out if there's a problem with her or the apartment. So she moves into a hotel room. In other side, Shekhar tries to call her but she won't pick up the call. Then Shekhar informed Dr. Meghna about what happened and asked her to call Dr. Reyna. Dr. Reyna receive a call from Dr. Meghna asking her where she is. In the hotel room, she reveals the truth about how Shekhar bribed Mr. Mukherjee to lie about the spirit's presence. That night, Dr. Meghna also sees the spirit and finally believes her friend. Sahil then pretends to help Reyna and along with Dr. Meghna they perform Seance a way to communicate with spirits. During the Seance Sahil gets injured. When Dr. Meghna treats his wounds she notices that there is no blood or DNA in the glasses she took out from his wounds. She becomes suspicious and contacts Mr. Mukharjee. Mr. Mukherjee tells her that Sahil's body is being used by an evil spirit. He tells her to warn Reyna. But the evil spirit kills Dr. Meghna before that. Reyna after the death of her best friend gets exhausted and Sahil trying to pacify her ultimately ends up sleeping together. Before that Reyna tells Sahil about the incident that caused the PTSD. One- night man comes carrying his pregnant wife and shouting for help in the hospital where she worked in Bengulru. Reyna attends the case and the man ask her to get his wife and child back with health while his wife asks Reyna to let her die as she wants freedom from her husband. After completing the sentence she dies. A nurse informs this to the man out of anger and madness he threatens to kill Reyna. In a stunt, the security guards shoot him to save Reyna after which Reyna faints. The next day Reyna goes to Sahil's flat and from the security guard there she finds out that the flat was not in use for some time now, which shocks her. Now Shekar also started believing her with learning the fact that Sahil was dead a month ago and his body went missing and the duo finds out that it was actually the spirit using Sahil's body. They meet Sahil's wife Avni and learn about the accident. Reyna tells Shekhar that they should go to Mr. Mukherjee for help. Shekhar then informs her that Mr. Mukherjee is dead. During this conversation, they were attacked by the spirit. After that, they go to the hospital where a lady, Roshni comes to help Reyna. They soon find out that Reyna is pregnant with 3 weeks old baby which shocks them with the fact that it has been only less than a week since she met Sahil. This news actually makes Shekar devastated and he suddenly takes a leave. The duo, Roshini and Reyna go to the horror house where the man and his wife used to live. There Reyna gets an ultimatum that the baby will kill her and she has time only till its birth. She comes back and finds Shekar waiting outside her flat. The duo patches up. Roshini, Reyna, and Shekar together decide to set up an operation theater in the church but was unable to do because the spirit kills the nurse and the attenders accompanying them. The opt for the alternative, the pooja. They perform it and in between the doll goes missing and after a fight with the spirit of the man they are able to burn the doll. Roshini falls through the window after the doll is burned. Sometimes later Reyna opens her eyes and feels sad that for her Roshini died. Shekar tells her that someone wants to meet them . The duo goes to meet Roshini's husband who reveals to them that Roshni was dead some days ago and her body went missing and sometimes early he got a call from the hospital that his wife's body is there and so he was able to do her last rites.

The Eliza Starbuck Barney Genealogical Record, now maintained by the Nantucket Historical Association, has been digitized and is now available online. Biography Eliza Starbuck was the third child of Joseph Starbuck and Sally Gardner, a Nantucket family that had become wealthy in the whale oil industry. At 18, Eliza married Nathaniel Barney. Despite their wealth, the couple shared a home with Eliza's sister, Eunice, and her husband William Hadwen. The husbands became business partners, opening a whale oil refinery on the site of the current Nantucket Whaling Museum. Eliza Starbuck Barney was secretary to Nantucket's Anti- Slavery Society from 1839 to 1840. The families welcomed William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass to their home at 100 Main Street in 1841 and hosted an anti-slavery meeting; Nathaniel Barney refused his dividends from the New Bedford Railroad to protest its refusal to carry black passengers. In 1851, Eliza attended the first women's suffrage convention in Massachusetts. Nathaniel and Eliza left Nantucket for Pennsylvania sometime after 1857, and Eliza returned after her husband's death in 1869. Her son, Joseph, built a home for her at 73 Main Street in 1871. It is now known as the Eliza Barney house. Genealogy records Barney's collection of genealogical data for residents of Nantucket spanned 1,702 handwritten pages in six 275-page books. The information includes family lineage, births, marriages, deaths, relocations, and deaths at sea. The record begins with the first European settlers in Nantucket, and extended beyond her death into 1912 through the work of her granddaughter. Genealogical information from the books was extracted by Nantucket Historical Association staff and volunteers and is now searchable via an online database. Barney's genealogical record contains some idiosyncratic flourishes, such as appending \\"Jr.\\" to the names of women with the same names as their mother.

The Ministry of State Control exercised strict state control over the accounting and expenditures of government funds and materials in the hands of state, cooperative, and social organizations, institutions, and enterprises. Furthermore, it checked on the execution of government decrees and regulations. History November 1917 - Decree authorized workers' control in all enterprises and organizations hiring labor or giving out work. January 1918 - the Council of People's Commissars USSR established the People's Commissariat of State Control to supervise \\"the legality, correctness, efficiency, and expediency of the turnover of the national and material capital, and safeguarding of this capital.\\" February 1920 - the People's Commissariat of State Control was reorganized into the RKI (People's Commissariat of Workers' and Peasants' Inspection), which was given the assignment of organizing a campaign against bureaucracy and red tape, supervising the execution of government decrees, and judging the validity of complaints. April 1923 - the 12th Party Congress decreed the combining of the RKI with the TsKK (Central Control Commission). The RKI-TsKK remained united from 1923 to 1934. February 1934 - the 17th Party Congress decreed the abolition of the RKI and the reorganization of the TsKK into the Party Control Commission under the TsK VKP(b). A new organ was established - the Soviet Control Commission under the Council of People's Commissars USSR. This Commission existed from February 1934 to September 1940 and was responsible mainly for checking on execution of government decrees. It did not control monetary or material expenditures. This control, ineffective though it was, was carried out by organs of the People's Commissariat of Finance and internal auditors. September 1940 - a ukase of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet USSR established the union-republic People's Commissariat of State Control USSR to exercise strict control over accounting and expenditures of state funds, to check on execution of government decisions, and to strengthen state discipline. On 15 March 1946, the People's Commissariat of State Control USSR was reconstituted as the Ministry of State Control USSR.

He chaired the Painting Department at the Massachusetts College of Art, where he was known for introducing innovative practices and techniques.  Early life and education  Kupferman was born in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston in 1909, the son of Samuel and Rose Kupferman. Like his contemporaries, Jack Levine and Hyman Bloom, he grew up in a working-class family. His father was an Austrian Jewish immigrant who worked as a cigar maker. His mother died in 1914, and five-year-old Lawrence was sent to live with his grandparents. Antisemitism was pervasive in Boston at the time, and Kupferman was bullied as a child. Years later he recalled, \\"Being a short, homely Jewish kid in a predominantly Irish-Catholic, snobby town, I admit, I was a lonely, misunderstood, introverted boy.\\" Kupferman attended the Boston Latin School and took part in the high school art program at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In the late 1920s he studied drawing under Philip Leslie Hale at the Museum School (an experience he called \\"stultifying and repressive\\"). In 1932 he transferred to the Massachusetts College of Art, where he first met his wife, the artist Ruth Cobb. He returned briefly to the Museum School in 1946 to study with the influential German-American painter Karl Zerbe.  Career  Evening Tide, 1948 Kupferman held various jobs while pursuing a career as an artist, including two years as a security guard at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. During the 1930s he worked as a drypoint etcher for the Federal Art Project, creating architectural drawings in a strictly realistic style very different from his later work. (For examples, see his drawings at the Fogg Museum and the Smithsonian.) In the 1940s he began incorporating more expressionistic forms into his paintings, and from then on his work became increasingly abstract. In 1946 he began spending summers in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he met and was influenced by Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Jackson Pollack, and other abstract painters. Around the same time he began exhibiting his work at the Boris Mirski Gallery on Newbury Street. = ICA controversy = In 1948, Kupferman was at the center of a controversy involving hundreds of Boston-area artists. That February, the Boston Institute of Modern Art issued a manifesto titled \\"'Modern Art' and the American Public\\" decrying \\"the excesses of modern art,\\" and announced it was changing its name to the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA). The poorly written statement, intended to distinguish Boston's art scene from that of New York, was widely perceived as an attack on modernism. In protest, Boston artists such as Karl Zerbe, Jack Levine, and David Aronson formed the Modern Artists Group and organized a mass meeting. On March 21, 300 artists, students, and other supporters met at the Old South Meeting House and demanded that the ICA retract its statement. Kupferman chaired the meeting and read a statement to the press: > The recent manifesto of the Institute is a fatuous declaration which > misinforms and misleads the public concerning the integrity and intention of > the modern artist. By arrogating to itself the privilege of telling the > artists what art should be the Institute runs counter to the original > purposes of this organization whose function was to encourage and to > assimilate contemporary innovation. Among the other speakers were Karl Knaths, H. W. Janson, Zerbe, Levine, and Aronson. At the same time, conservatives applauded the manifesto and exploited the situation for political purposes. In May 1950, the ICA issued a joint statement with the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art affirming the value of modern and abstract art. = Later years = Kupferman became a professor at the Massachusetts College of Art, and went on to chair its Painting Department. He retired in 1969. Much of his later work is characterized by \\"abstract, marinelike amoeboid forms.\\" Of his 1948 painting, Evening Tide (shown), he said, \\"This might be at the deepest bottom of an ocean, where light comes only from microscopic life forms, or it could be out, far beyond Venus, where things collect and begin again...Life is mysterious. I find relevance in the abstract, for in it is the womb of existence.\\" He died of Parkinson's disease in Boston on October 2, 1982. His work is included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Fogg Museum, and other museums and private collectors. His papers are on file with the Archives of American Art and Syracuse University. Kupferman's papers at the Archives of American Art include an unpublished historical novel, Beggar's Bread, which depicts the Boston art scene of the 1930s.

Masten (born 1951) is a Professor at the Institute for Child Development at the University of Minnesota known for her research on the development of resilience and for advancing theory on the positive outcomes of children and families facing adversity. Masten received the American Psychological Association Urie Bronfenbrenner Award for Lifetime Contributions to the Service of Science and Society in 2014. She has served as President of the Society for Research in Child Development and of Division 7 (Developmental) of the American Psychological Association. Masten's book Ordinary Magic: Resilience Processes in Development provides an optimistic perspective on children's natural resilience and ability to adapt to new experiences and challenging circumstances. This monograph explores how resilience can be nurtured in families, schools, and other social and community settings. It provides a guide for policy makers seeking to develop supports for children facing adversity due to poverty, family circumstances, or exposure to traumatic violence. With Barry Lester and Bruce McEwen, Masten is co-editor of the volume Resilience in Children. Biography Masten received her Bachelor of Arts degree cum laude in Psychology and English at Smith College in 1973. She went to graduate school at the University of Minnesota and obtained her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology in 1982. Masten joined the faculty of the Institute for Child Development at the University of Minnesota in 1986. She holds the positions of Regents Professor of Child Development, Irving B. Harris Professor in Child Development, and Distinguished McKnight University Professor at the University of Minnesota. Masten's research has been funded through grants from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the William T. Grant Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Mental Health. Masten's work is recognized internationally. In 2013, she was appointed Co-Chair of the new Forum on Investing in Young Children Globally by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. She served as the United States delegate at the International Congress on Psychology in Yokohoma, Japan in 2016, and was invited speaker at the 10th Annual Psychology Day at the United Nations in 2017. Masten teaches a MOOC on Coursera titled “Resilience in Children Exposed to Trauma, Disaster and War: Global Perspectives\\". In an interview with MinnPost in 2014, Masten indicated that research by Norman Garmezy on resilience inspired her to leave her job at the National Institute of Health in 1976 to collaborate with Garmezy at the University of Minnesota. Masten directs the Project Competence on Risk and Resilience at the University of Minnesota, which aims to increase understanding of resilience, i.e., positive adaptations to challenging circumstances encompassing poverty, homelessness, war, natural disasters, migration, and everyday life. International and domestic projects aim to identify optimal interventions and strategies for disadvantaged children to increase resilience and foster their success. As an example, Masten's team works on developing strategies to help homeless kids be resilient when faced with adversity. Research Masten's research focuses on factors that enhance the development of resilience in adolescents and families. She and her colleagues emphasize behavioral-psychosocial and neurobiological characteristics of resilience and how combining the two allows for a better understanding of resilience. Masten argues that competence and resilience are present in all children, and that all children need basic encouragement and opportunities throughout development in order to succeed. Her projects aim to inform policy makers on how to create effective environments to foster children's positive development and success. Although definitions of resilience may vary across cultures due to different standards for defining competence, across contexts, resilience is associated with processes of self-regulation and with secure attachment relationships. In a longitudinal study of 205 children from an urban community who were followed for ten years, Masten and her colleagues used multiple methods to examine children’s growth in competence, the adversities they faced, and the psychosocial resources each child had available to them, such as optimism, coping skills, a sense of mastery or personal control, and social support. Children who were higher functioning intellectually and experienced higher quality parenting had better academic outcomes, conduct, and peer social competence, even when faced with extreme adversity. In work with Karin Best and Norman Garmezy, Masten emphasizes that human psychological development is buffered which allows children to adapt when faced with challenging or threatening circumstances. Children manage adversity better when they have positive relationships with responsible adults, are good problem solvers, and are engaging and have characteristics that are valued by themselves and others. Masten and colleagues observed that long-term problems in contexts of adversity were often associated with neurobiological damage and with severe perturbations to the normal relationships of children with their caregivers.

It has a single smooth, tubular leaf and up to thirty or more scented, greenish, white and fawn-coloured flowers with a labellum which is often bent backwards. It was formerly included in Prasophyllum odoratum. Description Prasophyllum odoratissimum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single smooth, tube-shaped leaf which is long and wide. Between ten and thirty or more greenish, white and fawn-coloured flowers which are about long and wide are arranged along a flowering spike which reaches to a height of . As with other leek orchids, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal is held close to horizontally, the petals face forwards and the lateral sepals are erect and widely separated from each other. The labellum turns sharply upwards and often backwards near its middle. The edges of the upturned part of the labellum are wavy and there is a greenish callus in its centre. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum odoratissimum was first formally described in 1996 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Fish Creek in Walpole and the description was published in The Orchadian. It was formerly described as a variety of P. odoratum. The specific epithet (odoratissimum) is the superlative form of the Latin word odoratus meaning \\"fragrant\\" referring to the scented flowers of this species. Distribution and habitat The scented leek orchid grows in deep sandy soil and near-coastal woodland between Augusta and Augusta in the Esperance Plains, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions.

The weld may be formed entirely by melting parts of the base metal and no additional filler rod is used. There is some variation in the use of this term. Those bodies concerned with teaching the craft skill of welding tend to define it as using no filler rod, i.e. the technique is based purely on the base metal. Those concerned with the welded joint's metallurgy may make no distinction between a filler rod and the base metal, provided that the final metallurgy is identical. Most welding processes may be either autogenous, or may use additional filler. Some are characteristically autogenous and avoid filler. Some arc welding processes, including such major process such as Manual Metal Arc (stick) welding and MAGS (wire-feed) welding, cannot be used autogenously, as they rely on the consumption of a filler rod to provide the arc. Some processes are typically autogenous. These include some gas welding processes such as lead burning (although fillers may optionally be used) and oxy-acetylene welding in some positions, such as seam welding the edges of two overlapping sheets. Resistance welding, both spot welding and seam welding, is inherently autogenous as there is no convenient way to apply a filler. Friction and laser welding have similar restrictions. Some alloys are prone to changing their composition when heated, particularly a loss of zinc from brass by its evaporation as vapour. In these cases, an excess of 2–3% extra zinc may be provided in the filler rod to compensate. Silicon may also be used as an additive to reduce this loss. A few materials, such as the HY-80 series of high-strength steels, require a non-autogenous process to control their metallurgy. However advanced processes, such as hybrid laser arc welding, have been used to achieve the same effect autogenously.

Early life She was the second daughter of American diplomat Edward Bell (1882–1924) and his second wife, English heiress Etelka Bertha (née Surtees) Bell, who Virginia did not like. Her elder sister, Evangeline, later married the American diplomat David K. E. Bruce. Her father, who was involved in the reception in 1917 of the Zimmermann telegram, died in Peking while serving as the acting British Minister to China (when Minister Jacob Gould Schurman was back in Washington) in 1924. After the death of her father in 1924, her mother remarried to Sir James Leishman Dodds, a British career diplomat who served as the British Minister to Bolivia, Cuba and the Ambassador to Peru. From her mother's second marriage, she had a younger half-sister, Josephine Leishman Dodds, who married Squadron Leader Hugh Glyn Laurence Arthur Brooking, the King's Messenger, in 1949. Her maternal grandparents were Brig. Gen. Sir Herbert Conyers Surtees and the former Madeleine Augusta Crabbe (a daughter of Edward Crabbe and Ruth Herbert, artist's model to the English poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti, of whom Virginia later wrote a catalogue of his drawings and watercolours). Her aunt Dorothy was married to Sir Patrick Ramsay, the second son of John Ramsay, 13th Earl of Dalhousie and a brother- in-law of Princess Patricia of Connaught (through her husband Sir Alexander Ramsay), a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. On her father's side, she was a grand-niece of the publisher James Gordon Bennett Jr. When Virginia was young, the family lived in Beijing, and then according to her step-father's international movements. Career After her divorces and as an heiress living in London, she concentrated on research in art history, publishing several books and editing several others. Her books included a biography of George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle, and his wife, Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle, a biography of Louisa Baring, Lady Ashburton, the Scottish art collector and philanthropist, and a book about the friendship of art critic John Ruskin and Pauline, Lady Trevelyan. Personal life On June 15, 1937, Virginia Bell married the diplomat Henry Ashley Clarke in Tokyo. Clarke was a son of Dr. and Mrs. H. H. R. Clarke of Kent. During their marriage, he was posted to Lisbon and Paris, before he was knighted KCMG in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1952, and in 1953 became the British Ambassador to Italy in Rome. In 1956, she met David Craig, the general manager in Italy for the British European Airways and began an affair which led to Lady Clarke divorcing Sir Ashley in 1960. She remarried to Craig, but the marriage ended after two years. Virginia was photographed by Cecil Beaton and was friendly with critic and biographer Percy Lubbock, writer Osbert Sitwell and essayist Max Beerbohm. Upon the death of her grandmother, Lady Surtees, in 1948, Virginia inherited Mainsforth Hall and, in 1962, changed her surname to Surtees. Until 2014, she lived in a London flat overlooking Onslow Square in South Kensington. She sold her most important works at Christie's in 2014 and bequeathed others to the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Ashmolean Museum and the Fitzwilliam Museum.

Stage One was connected to the grid in May 2018. The second and final stage was connected to the grid in early November 2018. The project gradually reached full power in 2020. History It was expected to be completed and the two stages together able to deliver 220MW of electric power to the national grid from November 2018. It is being developed on of land which was previously used as an ostrich farm, sheep and cattle station and is owned by the Bungala Aboriginal Corporation, a community employment and social services organisation. The completed project could contribute 220MW to the electricity grid from 275MWdc generation and expects to produce 570 GWh per year. A professional training project is being set up to provide new skills and experience to 70 Aboriginal job seekers as part of the project. It will train them in operations and maintenance for stage 1 and construction of phase 2 of the project. Construction The project is being built in stages. Stages 1 and 2 will produce a combined 220MW of electricity. They were developed by Reach Energy and sold to a joint venture of Enel Green Power and Dutch Infrastructure Fund. The builder was Elecnor. Stage 3 is not scheduled to be built at this stage, but would include another 80MW of generation, and battery storage. Stage 3 was to be built if the company won a contract to supply electricity to the state government, however this contract was won by Aurora Solar Thermal Power Project. The entire output of stages 1 and 2 will be bought by Origin Energy. Reach Energy was advised by PwC throughout the development of the project. PwC claims to have operated as a partner, taking on a share of the financial risk, rather than being paid fees for services provided. The development is on a 19th-century ostrich farm, later used for grazing sheep and cattle, and spans the boundary between the localities of Emeroo and Wami Kata. Civil engineering and construction on site was managed by Catcon. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union accused the construction company of unsafe work practices when a construction worker was crushed by equipment on site in February 2018. Solar panels and some of the construction materials were delivered to the site by Bowmans Rail who established a new intermodal rail terminal adjacent to the construction site on the former Leigh Creek railway line. As the site is from the state capital of Adelaide where planning approval is granted, there had been some local issues that were not well understood in Adelaide. These related to dust during construction and ongoing contributions into the local economy once construction is complete. The state Planning Commission visited the site in July 2018. The first supply of electricity from one section of 45MW was connected to the National Electricity Market in late May 2018. The entire first phase of the project was commissioned in September and the second phase of the Bungala Solar Project started feeding electricity into the grid at the end of October 2018. Technical issues delayed the project finish until 2020.

There are seven discovered masks in total, found with the burials of six adult males and one male child. There were no women who had masks. They were discovered by Heinrich Schliemann during his 1876 excavation of Mycenae. There is also a death mask found in Grave Circle B, but it differs from the Circle A masks both in material, as it is made from electrum, and placement, as it was placed in a container besides an entombed body, rather than being placed upon the deceased. The relative scarcity of death masks in Grave Circle B indicate that the buried dead were of lesser wealth or status, rather than Grave Circle A with an abundance of material made from valuable materials, such as the Death masks.  Design  thumbAnother Funeral mask from a Mycenaean Grave Circle. The masks of Grave Circle A share similar features. They are made of a flat foil-like layer of gold and depict round, bald faces, with round eyes and prominent ears. The example picture depicts an elderly face, with lines that may either depict a mustache, or wrinkles, over a smiling mouth. These were made by chiseling fine facial details into a flat sheet of gold which had first been pounded against a wooden mold. This is an example of the repoussé style of adding detail to metal works.  Analysis  Schliemann claimed that one of the masks he discovered was the mask of King Agamemnon, and that this was the burial site of the legendary king from Homer's Iliad. The masks were likely direct representations of the deceased, symbolizing a continuation of the dead's identity in death, similar to funerary statues and incisions, immortalizing an idealized depiction of the deceased. The masks were not found on all the bodies inside the grave site, indicating that those who had them were of special status, and that the golden masks are a form of conspicuous consumption. Funerary masks like the ones found at Mycenae have not been found anywhere else in Mycenaean culture, and only a few of the bodies at Grave Sites bear masks.

He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford on 27 March 1762, aged 18. His father died in 1769 and the property near Shoreham, which Goring inherited through his mother, increased his political influence in the West of Sussex . The Goring family had represented various Sussex constituencies in Parliament. In the 1774 general election Goring stood as Member of Parliament for New Shoreham and topped the poll. The constituency had been enlarged in 1771 by an Act which enfranchised about 1200 freeholders. In Parliament he voted with the opposition and is only known to have made one speech. He decided not to stand again in 1780. Goring was married three times. His first wife was Sarah Beard, daughter of Ralph Beard of Hurstpierpoint, Sussex whom he married on 20 April 1779.

It was destroyed several times during the next three centuries by Frankish warlords, Saracens, Normans and Hungarians. At the end of the 10th century the abbey was re-founded and entered a golden age for the next two centuries. By the 13th century the spiritual life of the abbey had declined and the monks were mainly concerned with temporal matters. The abbey lost most of its monks during the Hundred Years' War and the Black Death of the 14th century. In 1429 it was fortified with stone walls, a moat and towers, two of which have survived. The abbey was again devastated by feuds in 1513, by the French Wars of Religion (1562–98) and by the Thirty Years' War (1618–48). In 1662 a final revival began when the monastery came under the Congregation of Saint Maur. Most of the surviving buildings date from the reconstruction by this congregation in the 18th century. At the start of the French Revolution in 1789 the monastery was dissolved and the property taken over by the state. It was sold, and the church and main buildings demolished so the stone could be used for building. The owners of the property added an orangerie and laid out a park in the 19th century. Today the private owners have made the grounds and buildings open for visitors for a small fee. Foundation The Abbey of Saint-Pierre & Saint-Paul in Bèze, Côte-d'Or, was the fourth of the Merovingian abbeys of the diocese of Langres, after Moûtiers-Saint-Jean, Saint-Bénigne and Saint-Seine. The abbey was founded by Amalgaire(fr), Duke of Lower Burgundy, brother of Waldalenus, Duke of Upper Burgundy and father of Saint Donatus of Besançon. Amalgaire founded the abbey in the reign of Chlothar II (r. 613–629) in the autumn of 629. The abbey's location was called the \\"Fountain of Bèze\\", after a karst spring that is the source of the Bèze river. The Chronique de Bèze from the first 3rd of the 12th century, describes foundation of the abbey on an unoccupied site. The Chronicle says: Amalgaire's wife Aquilina gave him two sons and one daughter, born between 595 and 605. His son Adalric would succeed him while his son Waldelene was educated as a monk at the Luxeuil Abbey under the Rule of Saint Columbanus. His daughter Adalsinde also became a nun. Waldelene became the first abbot at Bèze. Amalgaire also founded a monastery at Bregille on the right bank of the Doubs for his daughter Adalsinde, who became its first abbess. This monastery was given the existing Church of Saint Martin at Bregville. Amalgaire gave the Bèze Abbey a rich endowment of 31 domains with forests, vineyards and buildings, cultivators and winegrowers. He gave it vineyards in the Gevrey- Chambertin region that today are the source of the famous Chambertin-Clos de Bèze red Burgundy wine. Merovingian period (629–714) The monks of Bèze followed the Rule of Saint Columbanus, which Waldalène brought from Luxeuil Abbey. The first buildings were a rectangular stone structure surrounded by wood and earth outbuildings with thatched roofs. After the death of Amalgaire around 655 civil war raged in Burgundy and the country was ravaged by rival bands of Neustrian and Austrasian Franks. The reign of Chlothar III (r. 657–673), son of Clovis II (r. 639–657), had just started in Austrasia in late 657 when civil disturbances made Brégille untenable. Adalsinde and her brother Adalric begged her brother Waldelène and his monks to give her and her nuns refuge in Bèze, and in return transferred to him the priests of Saint Martin. Bèze was also ruined, its property titles destroyed and its monks scattered. When peace was restored Waldalene made haste to repair the losses of his monastery. To proceed faster he used credit from the new Duke of Burgundy, Sichelm. A diploma was issued by Chlothar III in 658 or 664 that confirmed the donations made by Amalgaire. Duke Adalric lost his duchy some time between 658 and 664. The king entrusted the lord Gengoul with the protection of the abbey. The duke, or his son Adalrich, Duke of Alsace, was restored to possession of the monastery of Bèze by the royal precept of 665. Adalric abused his authority to ransack the abbey. Later Adalric deserted King Theuderic III of Neustria (r. 673–691) and joined his enemies, who chose Dagobert II (r. 676–679) as King of Austrasia. Theuderic III of Neustria The war between Theuderic of Neustria and Dagobert of Austrasia once more devastated Bèze. Waldalène had to rebuild the abbey from ruins. In 676 Theuderic, now victorious, gave Waldalène all of Adalric's property. Adalric settled permanently in Alsace after the troubles of 675–676. Waldalène died in 680. The abbey flourished under the three abbots that followed, Bercand or Bercang, around 680, Ferréol around 700 and Syranne around 720. Carolingian period (714–990) The Saracens, who had conquered Spain in 714, crossed the Pyrennees and devastated the south of France. They penetrated up the Rhône, the Saône and the Loire until finally defeated by Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732. The Saracens sacked the abbey of Bèze around 730. Dom Jean Mabillon relates that they destroyed Autun, pulled down the Abbey of Bèze (monasterium Besuense), were repulsed from Sens when they attacked it in 732, but then massacred Saint Mellin and the monks of Luxeuil Abbey. The anthropologist Gustave Lagneau(fr) considered that some of the present population of the region showed signs of Saracen descent. Between 751 and 754 King Pepin the Short (r. 751–768) gave the abbey to his concubine, Angla or Anglais wife of Théodard, to be desecrated or dilapidated by her according to her caprice. Pepin also dismissed the bishop of Langres at this time, and replaced him by his brother Remi. After this the abbey was entrusted to the bishops of Langres, but due to the difficulties of the times it was only rebuilt under the Emperor Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), when Bishop Albéric restored the buildings and reintroduced discipline. Albéric was made Bishop of Langres by Louis the Pious around 820. The Chronicle of Bèze relates that Albéric was afflicted by a violent colic that made him despair of his life. An old man appeared to him in a dream and told him he would recover if he promised to reestablish the monastery. He made the promise and regained his health. Albéric gave Bèze the church of Saint Laurent in Beurey in 830. Louis the Pious visited Langres in 830 with his son Lothair and held a provincial council. This council and other synods seem to have resulted in the general reform that reestablished the common life of the canons and caused all the monasteries to restore their original rules. At Albéric's request Louis issued a charter that confirmed all the property of the abbey. Albéric repaired the church of Saint-Mammès at the abbey. Alberic died in 839 and his body was taken to Bèze on 22 December 839. Hungarian campaigns in Europe On 6 October 883 Geilon, bishop of Langres, gave the abbey of Bèze the relics of Saint Prudent de Narbonne, which he had brought back from a chapel in Narbonne after his pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. In 887, when marauding Normans approached the monks of Bèze transported the body of Saint Prudent to Saint- Etienne de Dijon. When the invasion was over the monks rebuilt the ruins of the abbey and asked for the saint's body from Dijon. The canons of Dijon at first refused, then at the command of Bishop Gauthier of Langres pretended to comply, but in fact gave the monks the body of Saint Silvin. Eventually the ruse was discovered, and the body of Saint Prudent was carried with great ceremony from Dijon to Bèze in 931. The abbey was destroyed twice during the Hungarian invasions of Europe. It was burned in July 936 when the Hungarians came from Burgundy, and again the next year when the Hungarians had spread through France, Burgundy and Aquitaine, plundering and ravaging everywhere. The Hungarians caused so much damage to the monastery that it could not be restored for eleven years. Golden age (990–1200) William of Volpiano, Abbot of Bèze from 990 to 1031 At the end of the 10th century Bruno de Roucy, Bishop of Langres, asked Majolus of Cluny to send monks to rebuild the abbeys of the Langres diocese. Among them was William of Volpiano, who became abbot of Saint-Bénigne at Dijon, and was also abbot of Bèze from 990 until his death in 1031. William introduced the customs of Cluny to both abbeys. The Rule of Saint Benedict is first mentioned in the Chronicle of Beze when it comes to the William, an Italian who became abbot in 990. Unlike Saint-Bénigne, the properties of the abbey were concentrated in the immediate vicinity, towards Champlitte and the Saône. Thanks to William's reforms Bèze attracted gifts from local nobles such as the Fouvents, descendants of the counts of Atuyer, the Beaumonts and Montsaugeons towards Langres and the Beaujeus on the Saône. The property included serfs. For example, in the 11th century the abbey received the serf Arnulf and \\"one half of the sons or daughters of the said Arnulf\\" for the benefit of Sir Henri de Ferté's soul. Raoul le Blanc, Viscount of Dijon, became a monk at Saint-Bénigne, then was made grand-prior of Bèze under abbot William and played a major role in the restoration of the abbey. Raoul dedicated his immense fortune to entirely rebuilding the abbey, including executing two ossuaries in the chapel of the Virgin and replacing the remains of the old destroyed tombs. He rebuilt the church on a larger scale, and it was dedicated in 1016 or 1018 in a ceremony arranged by Lambert de Vignory, Brunon's successor as bishop in a ceremony attended by many bishops and clergy from various provinces of France. In 1018 the lord of Fouvent founded the priory of Saint-Sépulcre beside his castle, subordinate to Bèze abbey. Ulger or Olger 1, former prior of Beze, was abbot from 1031 to 1052. He died on return from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In October 1050 Pope Leo IX visited Langres, where he settled a dispute between the Bèze monks and the Langres canons over tithes from one of the monks' vineyards. He said that \\"By the authority of the Holy Fathers who preceded me in the see of Rome, it was permitted that no church founded in honour of St Peter, the prince of the Apostles, should pay a rent of tithes to another church.\\" This silenced the canons. In 1066 a solemn assembly of bishops, abbots and local lords was held at the abbey of Bèze to settle difference between the abbot of Saint-Benigne and the officers of Robert, Duke of Burgundy. In 1083 Ponce, lord of the Château de Beaujeu, gave the abbey a chapel built in honour of Saint Vallier with lands and various rights. Étienne de Joinville(fr) was the son and grandson of counts on his father's side, and grandson of Arnoul, count of Reynel on his mother's side. He served as a soldier before becoming a monk. He was a monk at the Priory of Saint-Oyan-de-Bar and then at Cluny, where his uncle Widon was Grand Prior. He was appointed prior at Sainte-Germaine de Bar- sur-Aube, then of Bar-sur-Seine. In 1088 he was chosen as abbot of Bèze by bishop Robert. Under the abbot Étienne de Jonvelle (c. 1088–1124) the grants multiplied, particularly in the form of restitution of churches. Humbert de Fouvent, who had been killed in the service of the Bishop of Langres around 1085–87, was buried at Bèze. His widow gave the abbey the chapel of his castle, the church of Lavoncourt and two silver cyphes. In 1093 Irmuin de Seveux gave the abbey the churches of Saint-Denis and Saint-Laurent. Pope Paschal II stayed at the abbey in 1107. He was accompanied by Henry, Abbot of Saint-Jean-d'Angély. Pope Paschal II Étienne doubled the size of the abbey's domain by restitution and donations, and expanded the abbey buildings, extending the church to the river. There are still remains of an axial chapel from the early 12th century. This is all that is left of Étienne's buildings. The chapels would have extended towards the Bèze river from the apse of the church. Under Étienne's rule the number of monks grew to about 50 living in the abbey and another 50 in subordinate priories. The monk Jean (died 1120) wrote the Chronicon Besuense, a history of the abbey from its foundation to the start of the 12th century. The monk Teobaudus (died 1130) wrote the Miracula Sancti Prudentii, which described the miraculous cures that had been effected by the relics of Saint Prudent. The monk Raoul the Bald wrote the Libri Quinque Historiae, a history of events from 900 to 1044. He famously wrote of the period, \\"At that time the kingdom of France was covered with a white cloak of churches.\\" In 1198 the abbey was accidentally burned. Feudalism, decline and ruin (1200–1662) In 1215 the abbot Albert received a letter from Pope Innocent III on the subject of damages caused by a fire which had forced the abbot to send the monks to Cluny. In 1219 the abbey finally accepted an offer that had first been made in 1049 and sold its Clos de Bèze vineyard to the canons of Langres. Over time the rule was relaxed and the monks became more concerned with temporal than spiritual matters. In 1253 the abbot Geoffroy II was the first to hold the feudal title \\"Baron de Bèze\\". Around 1280 the abbot Girard III built a school outside the village for children who were not destined for the church. The building on the Place de Verdun still stands. The archives tell of disputes between the abbot and the bishop of Langres, disputes between the monks and the people of Bèze, disputes with the local lords, disputes over feudal dues and rights of use. In 1307 a dispute between the Bèze Abbey and some burgesses of the abbey was heard first by the Jours de Troyes, then escalated to the king's Parlement. The Hundred Years' War began in 1337. The Black Death appeared in Marseille, then spread throughout France in 1348–49. Some thought the world was ending, and others thought God was punishing France for her sins. Guillaume de Chanac became abbot in 1352. He later became bishop of Chartres and a cardinal. In 1389 a complaint was lodged by 15 officers and monks of the abbey against the abbot Thiéry de Charmes concerning maladministration of the neighboring school. The award, issued by the court of Langes on the Saturday before Pentecost, meticulously itemized the rights and duties of the abbot. These included the requirement to supply wine to the master and clerics of Bèze to drink after vigils. Chaix Tower in the south Simon de Torcenay was abbot from 1423 until his death in 1444. He repaired the buildings and strengthened the fortifications. In 1425 he built the first forges on the Bèze. He was a \\"warrior monk\\" and fortified the abbey with walls surrounded by a moat and accessed over a drawbridge He built a second line of walls to fortify the village. Around 1428 Claus de Werve made a polychromed limestone statue of the Virgin and Child for the abbey, which was installed in the Church of Saint- Martin at Bézouotte and has survived. Construction of the fortified enclosure began in 1429. The Chaux tower in the south and the Oysel tower in the north still stand, and carry the arms of Simon de Torcenay. In 1433 there was a risk of rebellion by the lords of Château-Vilain, Grancey and Vergy against the Duke of Burgundy. On 10 May 1433 the duke addressed letters patent to the monks and people of Bèze telling them to remain faithful to the king of France and refuse entry to any stranger or enemy. That year he invited the abbot Simon de Torcenay, his councilor and chamberlain, to attend a solemn ceremony of a chapter of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Bèze was devastated by the war between the Duchy of Burgundy and Franche-Comté, in which the Swiss invaded in 1513. During the French Wars of Religion the Bishop of Langres supported Henry IV of France but Bèze was occupied by forces of the Catholic League. In 1592 there were only six monks and two novices left. With the introduction of the \\"commende\\" system the abbot was appointed by the king and had sole responsibility for managing the property. Abbots, living outside the abbey, kept most of the income and granted the monks the bare minimum. In 1615 the lay lord Charles de Ferrières was appointed abbot. In 1636, as a precaution, the relics of the Abbey of Bèze were deposited with the Abbey of Saint-Bénigne in Dijon. They were brought back from there 22 years later. During the Thirty Years' War in 1636 the Austrian army of Matthias Gallas ravaged the Vingeanne valley. Swedish mercenaries, nominally allies of France, destroyed what was left. The abbey was ruined, with only a few monks left, each living in a small house they had built for themselves. Last revival (1662–1789) Bèze Abbey in 1690 In 1662 a final revival of the monastery began with the arrival of 12 monks of the Congregation of Saint-Maur. The Congregation of St Maur had been granted letters patent by Louis XIII of France in 1618 to manage the reformed monasteries of France. It contained more than 180 monasteries by the end of the 17th century. The congregation enforced a return to the strict Rule of Saint Benedict. It is best known for its scholarship, including historical research, biblical studies, chronology and liturgy. The abbey was probably partially rebuilt in the 17th century. In 1731 the abbey and its revenues were transferred to the newly created Bishopric of Dijon. It was now administered by a simple \\"prior\\" rather than an abbot, and depended on the bishop for funding. The Congrégation de Saint-Maur planned a reconstruction program for the abbey, with plans that provided more southern light and air to the monks' cells. The buildings and Saint Peter and Paul church were destroyed and rebuilt from 1738, using materials from the old building. The initial plans were changed in 1769 under the direction of the architect Charles Saint-Père, who conceived a large building south of the church. It had a central section holding the refectory and the dormitory, with two wings. Of the long \\"monastic palace\\", the wings have survived but the main building, which held the cells of the monks on the first floor, has been destroyed. The buildings included an infirmary, guest rooms for distinguished visitors, a library that had 4,175 volumes according to the May 1790 inventory and apartments for the Cellerier and Sous-Cellerier, who looked after the material life of the abbey. The west wing held a large library on the second floor. A cloister gallery runs along the central north side. There is a storehouse arranged symmetrically with the west wing. The church was roughly the same as the former church, but somewhat shortened and no longer extending to the river. Post-revolution (1789–present) View from the northwest At the start of the French Revolution, on 2 November 1789 the Constituent Assembly decreed nationalization of the lands of the church and the religious houses. The monks were turned out of the abbeys and left to look after themselves. In May 1790 the municipality of Bèze made an inventory of the monks' property. The last three monks left in January 1791. The municipality acquired the storehouse to hold the town hall and the school. In August 1791 a Langres paper maker named Faitout obtained possession of the other buildings. After a failed spinning project the abbey church began to be destroyed around 1796 and the stones sold. The central part of the buildings was demolished in 1805. The former \\"convent house\\" was sold in 1804 to Frédéric Rochet, an ironmaster. The property then passed through several hands before being acquired by the Dijon industrialist Philippe Breuil in 1872, whose descendants owned the property as of 2014. The forges on the Belle Ile en Bèze operated until the end of the 19th century, when they were replaced by a hydroelectric power station, which operated until the 1960s. Sheds, stables and an orangerie in the southwest were built after 1845 and a park laid out. The English-style park was planted with many unusual trees in the 19th century and includes a flower garden with old roses. The site has a total area of . There are two 4-level horseshoe towers from the old enclosure. The Oysel tower to the north has had its internal divisions destroyed. The Chaix tower to the west has a vaulted ground floor and 2nd and 3rd floors reached by a stairway in the thickness of the wall. Of the main structure what remains are two symmetrical buildings with basements and two floors. There is an elongated building to the east and remains of other structures including a barrel-vaulted chapel. The axial chapel survives with two pilasters and their capitals. The east and west wings of the 18th century convent building, the Chaux and Oysel towers including the washhouse, the floor of the old church and the axial chapel, facades, roofs and cellar structure were registered as Monuments Historiques on 15 September 2010. The property is privately owned. Both the park and gardens are open to visitors, for a small fee.

The members of this list either hunted big game for sport, to advance the science of their day, or as professional hunters. It includes brief biographical details focusing on the type of game hunted, methods employed, and weapons used by those featured. Africa =Bunny Allen= Frank Maurice \\"Bunny\\" Allen (1906–2002) was an English-born professional safari guide in Kenya. Born in Buckinghamshire, as a young boy Allen learnt to poach game, gaining the nickname “Bunny” for his skill at snaring rabbits. In 1927 Allen followed his older brothers to Kenya. Managing a farm Allen would take guests of the owner on shoots, bringing him to the attention of Bror von Blixen-Finecke and Denys Finch Hatton. Allen soon became one of Finch Hatton’s guns on shoots, including the Prince of Wales’ 1928 safari. Rising to Captain in the 6th King's African Rifles during World War II, after the war Allen started his own safari business and by the 1950s was considered the best and the most expensive safari operator in Kenya. Allen was also regularly employed by film studios when filming in Africa, he is rumoured to have had love affairs with Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner. Allen predominantly used a .470 Nitro Express double rifle from John Rigby & Company to hunt big game. =Yank Allen= George \\"Yank\\" Allen (1867–1924) was an American born professional lion hunter in Northern and Southern Rhodesia in the early 20th century. Allen was originally a Texan cowboy who reputedly left the United States as a result of a gunfight, first travelling to South America before arriving in Southern Africa in 1900. Renowned as an eccentric, Allen was quite contemptuous of lions, never referring to them as lions but instead calling them \\"dawgs\\" that did not roar but instead \\"bawled\\". Allen supplemented his income by hunting lion for the protection of cattle, charging farmers £7 per lion. In 1912 Allen became a professional lion hunter when the Southern Rhodesian cattle enterprise Liebig's hired him to protect their herd of 20,000 cattle, paying him £10 per lion plus transport and labour. Allen always hunted alone, not trusting his native help, and his favorite rifles for lion hunting were a .303 British service rifle and a .577 Black Powder Express double rifle. At the time of his death he was said to have killed around 300 lions, making him in the opinion of \\"Pondoro\\" Taylor one of the most successful lion hunters ever. =Major G.H. Anderson= Major Gordon H. \\"Andy\\" Anderson (1878–1946) was a British soldier, elephant hunter and safari guide. Anderson commenced big game hunting in 1909 and elephant hunting in 1912, after meeting lifelong friend Jim Sutherland. Over the course of his life Anderson shot between 350 and 400 elephants, his favourite calibres for elephant hunting being the .577 Nitro Express, the .470 Nitro Express and the .318 Westley Richards. From 1921 Anderson also started acting as a professional safari guide, he most notable clients being the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother) in 1924 and (in partnership with Denys Finch Hatton) the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) and his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester in 1928. In 1934 Anderson was one of the founding members of the East African Professional Hunter's Association, in 1946 he wrote his autobiography, African Safaris, which was published posthumously. =William Charles Baldwin= Baldwin attacked by a lion from African hunting.

After school Baldwin tried being a clerk in a shipping office and a farmer but in 1851 he packed his guns, rifles, saddles and seven deerhounds, purchased from Earl Fitzwilliam's gamekeeper at great expense, and sailed for South Africa to hunt elephant. Baldwin hunted from Zululand to the Zambezi and west to Lake Ngami, he claimed to be the second white man to set eyes on the Victoria Falls in 1860. Baldwin hunted mainly mounted on horseback with local hounds, the deerhounds having proved of little use. He returned to England in 1861, never returning to Africa, in 1863 he published a memoir African hunting: from Natal to the Zambezi. =Deaf Banks= Banks with ivory from elephant shot in the Lado, 1905. Frederick Grant \\"Deaf\\" Banks (1875–1954) was variously a trader, government official, planter, elephant hunter and game ranger in Uganda. Born in London, but raised in Christchurch, New Zealand, Banks went to Africa in 1896 at the age of 21. Initially working with a coastal merchant, Banks moved into coffee planting and then set off on a prospecting trip to the Congo before he took to big game hunting. Banks did most of his hunting in Uganda Protectorate and the Lado Enclave, and is said to have killed over 1,000 elephants in his life, despite being almost completely deaf. Banks did most of his elephant hunting with a 6.5×54mm Mannlicher–Schönauer in open country and a .577 Nitro Express double rifle for cover. =W.D.M. \\"Karamojo\\" Bell= Walter Dalrymple Maitland \\"Karamojo\\" Bell (1880–1954) was a Scottish, soldier, fighter pilot, adventurer and elephant hunter. Arriving in Africa at the end of the 19th century, from 1902 Bell hunted elephant in Kenya, Uganda, Abyssinia, Sudan, the Lado Enclave (one of the few to do so there legally), French Ivory Coast, Liberia, French Congo and the Belgian Congo. During his hunting career, Bell shot 1,011 elephants and numerous other game including 25 lions, 16 leopards, 4 white rhinoceros, 67 black rhinoceros and between 600 and 700 buffalo. Bell was an exceptional shot who preferred to hunt with smaller calibre bolt actioned rifles than large bore double rifles, around 800 of his elephants were killed with a .275 Rigby. Bell published two books on his time in Africa, The wanderings of an elephant hunter in 1923 and Karamojo safari in 1949, along with a number of articles. Bell is considered one of the most successful of Africa's professional elephant hunters. =Bror Blixen= Blixen (left) with Denys Finch Hatton (right) and Edward, Prince of Wales, 1928. Baron Bror Fredrik \\"Blix\\" von Blixen-Finecke (1886–1946) was a Swedish baron, writer and professional safari guide.

The marriage did not last, Blixen was a renowned philanderer, and after their separation in 1922 he was forced to flee from his creditors and hide in the bush. Close friend Sir Robert Coryndon intervened and referred some friends to Blixen to go on safari, and throughout the 1920s and 1930s he guided safaris throughout East Africa, notable clients included Edward, Prince of Wales and Ernest Hemingway. Blixen returned to Sweden in 1938, where he died eight years later at the age of 59. Blixen hunted extensively with a .600 Nitro Express double rifle by W.J. Jeffery & Co, in 1937 he published an autobiography in Swedish, African hunter. =Peter Capstick= Peter Hathaway Capstick (1940–1996) was an American big game hunter and author.

After several years he returned to New York where he arranged professionally guided hunting trips. Making his first trip to Africa in 1968, Capstick later became a professional hunter and game ranger in Zambia, Botswana, and Rhodesia. Publishing articles about hunting and adventure from the late 1960s, Capstick published his first book Death in the Long Grass in 1977, establishing his reputation as a writer. =Cigar= Cigar was a 19th-century hottentot elephant hunter. Originally a jockey in Grahamstown, Cigar first hunted elephant for William Finaughty in 1869, keeping half of the ivory from elephants he shot. Finaughty stated Cigar was an excellent horseman and a fair shot, but his fear of elephants prevented him from having any success at that time. Frederick Selous first met Cigar in 1872 when Cigar agreed to take Selous elephant hunting; by then he had completely overcome his fear of elephants. At the time Cigar employed two native hunters and three porters; Selous described Cigar as a slightly built active man with wonderful endurance and a very good game shot who hunted with an old heavy 6 bore muzzleloader. Cigar originally hunted elephant from horseback with Finaughty, but when Selous met him he hunted them on foot due to tsetse flies. =William Finaughty= William \\"Old Bill\\" Finaughty (1843–1917) was a 19th-century elephant hunter in Southern Africa. Born in Grahamstown, in 1864 at age 21 Finaughty travelled to Matabeleland to trade; chief Mzilikazi was friendly to his party and he witnessed a dance of 25,000 warriors. Shooting his first elephants on that trip, after making further expeditions in 1865 and 1866, Finaughty decided to hunt elephant professionally in 1867, which he did until 1876. Finaughty did all of his hunting from horseback, predominantly with a 4 bore muzzle loader, which fired a 4 oz bullet driven by \\"a handful of powder\\", whose recoil would leave his shoulder black and blue after a day’s elephant hunting and on a number of occasions knocked him out of the saddle. On one of his last hunts Finaughty used a \\"newly-invented\\" breech loading rifled 12 bore, and the memory of its recoil still made his eyes water 30 years later. It is believed Finaughty killed over 400 elephants in his life. He retired from elephant hunting when most elephants moved into tsetse fly country, not wanting to risk himself or his horses. In 1913, American Mr G.L. Harrison interviewed Finaughty, and upon his return to the United States he published Finaughty's recollections in The recollections of William Finaughty - elephant hunter 1864-1875. =Denys Finch-Hatton= Finch Hatton with tusker.

Hunter, Finch Hatton’s most notable guests were the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) and his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester in 1928. Finch Hatton hunted with a Mannlicher bolt actioned rifle in 6.5×54mm Mannlicher–Schönauer, a second hand Rigby bolt actioned rifle in .350 Rigby, a Lancaster double rifle that he had converted from .450 No 2 Nitro Express to .450 Nitro Express as it was easier to source ammunition and an Army & Navy 20 bore shotgun. Finch Hatton remains famous as the lover of Karen Blixen, their relationship being detailed in her memoir Out of Africa, which she wrote under her nom de plume \\"Isak Dinesen\\". =Roualeyn Gordon-Cumming= Gordon-Cumming attacking a hippopotamus with a knife.

Growing up in the Scottish Highlands, from a young age Gordon-Cumming distinguished himself for his skill at deer stalking and salmon fishing. Gordon-Cumming briefly held commissions in the Honourable East India Company and later the Cape Mounted Rifles, resigning the latter after several months to take up hunting in Africa. Between 1843 and 1848 Gordon-Cumming hunted chiefly in Bechuanaland and the valley of the Limpopo River, mostly he did so on horseback with the assistance of hounds and always wearing a kilt, both when mounted and when on foot. Gordon-Cumming killed numerous game including lion, leopard, white rhinoceros, black rhinoceros, buffalo, giraffe, various antelope, hippopotamus, a rock python and 105 elephants, his favourite weapon was a 10 bore muzzle loaded 2 groove double rifle made by Dickson of Edinburgh until it burst causing him great lament.

In 1836, following health issues, Harris was ordered to southern Africa to rehabilitate, where he went on a five-month safari from the Cape Colony to Matabeleland. During that trip Harris shot elephant, quagga, giraffe, hippopotamus, wildebeest, hartebeast, impala, rhinoceros, waterbuck and giraffe, the ivory from the elephant he shot funded the entire expedition. A naturalist, when not hunting Harris spent part of each day skillfully drawing animals and native Africans, he also collected two complete skulls of every quadruped found in southern Africa, along with a complete skeleton and skin of the sable antelope, which became known as the \\"Harris buck\\", these remains were later displayed in the British Museum. In 1838 Harris published an account of his time in southern Africa, The wild sports in southern Africa and in 1840 he published a folio volume of lithographs, Portraits of the game animals of southern Africa. =Henry Hartley= Henry Hartley (1815–1876) was an English born 19th century South African farmer and elephant hunter.

Mzilikazi and Lobengula liked and trusted him, Mzilikazi called him the \\"Keeper of the King's Elephants\\". It is said that Hartley discovered gold in the Hartley Hills (later named in his honour) in 1866 near where he made his annual hunting camp, guiding Karl Mauch back the following year who confirmed the presence of gold, their announcing the discovery led to South Africa's gold rush. In 1869 Hartley escorted Thomas Baines to these goldfields. Hartley did all of his hunting from horseback, it is believed he shot between 1,000 and 1,200 elephant in his life, he eventually died from injuries caused by a rhinoceros collapsing on top of him after he had shot it. =J.A. Hunter= John Alexander \\"J.A.\\" Hunter (1887–1963) was a Scottish born Kenyan game control officer, big game hunter, safari guide, author and conservationist. Moving to Kenya in 1908, Hunter initially gained employment hunting lions for the Uganda Railway and over the next 50 years made a living as a professional hunter, it is believed Hunter killed over 1,400 elephant in his life. For much of his career Hunter was a Kenyan Government game control officer, between 1944 and 1946 he killed over 1,000 rhinoceros on behalf of the government in the Makueni District, the government wishing to clear the area of wildlife to resettle the Kamba people, Hunter later regretted the necessity of the task. An author of a number of books, his 1952 work Hunter was a Book of the Month Club selection the following year and was widely purchased by school libraries throughout the English speaking world in its abridged form African Hunter. In later years Hunter became concerned about the fate of African game and advocated for the establishment of wildlife protection areas. Hunter hunted with a number of rifles, he arrived in Kenya with his father’s Purdey shotgun and a .275 Rigby rifle whilst later he used a .416 Rigby, a .500 Nitro Express and a .505 Gibbs rifle. =Petrus Jacobs= Petrus Jacobs was an early Boer elephant hunter in South Africa, described by Frederick Selous as \\"the most experienced elephant hunter in South Africa.\\" Over seventy-three years old when Selous met him, Jacobs must have been born around 1800. Jacobs is believed to have killed between 400 and 500 bull elephants, mostly from horseback but also on foot when hunting in tsetse fly country. Jacobs is also said to have killed over 100 lions, Selous saw him be mauled badly by one at over seventy-three years of age, he was saved by his three powerful dogs who attacked the lion's hind quarters, and within two months he was able to ride a horse again. =Frederick Vaughan Kirby= Kirby hunting buffalo from In haunts of wild game. Frederick Vaughan Kirby was a soldier, traveller, big game hunter and collector of natural history specimens.

Manners shot approximately 1,000 elephants in his life, his finest tusker had tusks weighing , the fourth largest African tusks ever recorded, he estimated that for every elephant he shot with tusks in the range, he had to walk . Manners predominantly hunted with a Winchester Model 70 firing the .375 H&H; Magnum over iron sights (he thought a rifle scope added unnecessary weight), although for a period when .375 H&H; ammunition was suddenly unavailable he resorted to a .30-06 Springfield, although he only killed 40 elephants with it and only under the most certain conditions. Manners later ran a curio shop in the Skukuza camp in Kruger National Park, where he was a tourist attraction himself, in 1980 he published his autobiography, Kambaku!. =Bali Mauladad= Muhammad Iqbal \\"Bali\\" Mauladad (1926–1970) was a Kenyan sportsman and safari guide.

Neumann= Arthur Henry Neumann (1850–1907) was an English explorer, hunter, soldier, writer and big game hunter. Arriving in South Africa in 1869, Neumann held various jobs until 1877 when he took up hunting professionally, which except for a brief period of military service in 1879 for the Anglo-Zulu War, he did uninterrupted until 1890 in the Transvaal and Swaziland and along the Limpopo and Sabi rivers, shooting most game in southern Africa with the exception of elephant. In 1890 he entered the service of the Imperial British East Africa Company exploring for the Uganda Railway during which period he shot his first elephant. In 1893 Neumann departed on a 3-year hunting and exploring trip in East Africa, returning to England to publish Elephant hunting in Equatorial East Africa in 1897. Between 1899 and 1902 Neumann participated in the Second Boer War, in 1902 he returned to East Africa hunting elephant continuously until 1906 when he returned to England, dying the following year. One of the first to hunt elephant professionally in East Africa, it is unknown how many elephant Neumann shot in his life although it is believed to be in excess of 300. In his early career Neumann hunted with a .577 Black Powder Express double rifle and a .461 No 1 Gibbs–Metford–Farquharson rifle both by George Gibbs of Bristol and a 10 bore double rifle by Holland & Holland, when the .303 British cartridge was introduced he hunted extensively with a Lee-Metford rifle and in 1902 he acquired a Rigby .450 Nitro Express double rifle which was his favourite for elephant. =William Cotton Oswell= William Cotton Oswell (1818–1893) was an English born 19th century explorer and big game hunter.

Once Oswell arrived in Africa his health quickly recovered and over the next 8 years, except for a short period in England and India, he spent his time exploring and hunting. No source describes the total amount of game Oswell shot, but he shot large numbers of elephant, rhinoceros, buffalo, hippopotamus, giraffe and quagga. Every animal Oswell shot, except 3 elephant, were subsequently completely eaten by his camp followers or local tribesmen, he once fed 600 highly emaciated men, women and children of the Bakaa tribe for 7 weeks and sent them home with an abundant supply of meat. According to Sir Samuel Baker, Oswell \\"was a first-rate horseman, and all of his shooting was from the saddle, or by dismounting for a shot after he had run his game to bay.\\" Always shooting game from the closest possible range, Oswell had horses he was riding killed by buffalo and white rhinoceros, and on one occasion a lioness landed on his horse's rump. Oswell did almost all of his hunting with a double- barrelled 10 bore muzzle loader made by Purdey which weighed , fired 5 to 6 drams (8.9 to 10.6 g) of fine powder and was specially built to fire solid balls. =Pete Pearson= Pearson with elephant, Lado Enclave 1905 Peter C. \\"Pete\\" Pearson (1876–1929) was an Australian born game ranger and elephant hunter.

In 1924 Pearson accompanied the safari for the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother) as a hunting guide during their visit to Uganda. In 1928 the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) travelled through East Africa including Uganda, Pearson was charged with organising a hunting safari and for 8 days the Royal party hunted under Pearson's guidance. On the last day of the safari, a rogue bull elephant charged the Royal Party and Pearson placed himself between the Prince and the elephant, shooting with lethal effect. It is believed Pearson shot as many as 2,000 elephants over the course of his life, he used a .350 Rigby, a Rigby Mauser .375 H&H; Magnum, a W.J. Jeffery & Co .404 Jeffery and a .577 Nitro Express. =Philip Percival= Philip Hope Percival (1886–1966) was an English born Kenyan professional hunter.

In 1909 Percival received his big break, he was invited by Sir Alfred Pease to assist with a lion hunt for Theodore Roosevelt and the Smithsonian–Roosevelt African Expedition, following this he took to guiding hunting safaris full- time. One of the earliest established professional guides, Percival became one of the most respected and highest paid hunters of his day, his clients included Baron Rothschild, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, Gary Cooper, George Eastman and arguably the most famous Ernest Hemingway, who used Percival as the inspiration for the character 'Pop' in Green Hills of Africa. Known by colleagues as \\"the dean of hunters\\", Percival hunted with a pair of .450 No 2 Nitro Express boxlock double rifles made by Joseph Lang. =Major P.G.H. Powell-Cotton= Diorama of a taxidermied lion and African buffalo, both shot by Powell-Cotton, at the Powell-Cotton Museum Major Percy Horace Gordon Powell-Cotton (1866–1940) was an English naturalist, explorer, hunter collector and early conservationist. Embarking on his first expedition in 1890, Powell-Cotton made 28 expeditions over a 50-year period throughout Africa and Asia to gather and categorise zoological and ethnographical specimens. Powell-Cotton was primarily concerned with contributing to scientific knowledge through preservation and documentation, not with indiscriminately collecting trophies, returning with their remains to Britain to be mounted by renowned London taxidermist Rowland Ward. The Powell-Cotton Museum, built to house his specimens, contains over 16,000 mammal skeletons and skins but also includes butterflies, insects and birds. Among his most famous specimens was one of the largest tuskers ever killed, the pair of tusks weighed , the largest tusk was long, in diameter and weighed . An inveterate client of W.J.

In an editorial, The New York Times later questioned Rainey's sportsmanship, equating his hunting to \\"butcher's work\\", John Guille Millais wrote \\"Paul Rainey's method of hunting lions with a large pack of hounds can hardly come into the true category of lion-hunting where risks are taken. The dogs, it is true, were often killed or wounded; but as a friend who had taken part in the hunts remarked: 'It is just like rat- hunting, and about as dangerous'.\\" Rainey subsequently made a wildlife film of his hunting in Africa, Paul Rainey's African Hunt, released in April 1912 it was the largest money-making wildlife film of the decade. =Samaki Salmon= Roy John Dugdale \\"Samaki\\" Salmon (1888–1952) was a New Zealand born game warden and elephant control officer in Uganda. Arriving in Africa in 1911, Salmon became a coffee grower in the Uganda Protectorate the following year, gaining a reputation as a skilled elephant hunter by efficiently killing 20 elephant a year as was allowed with a planter's elephant hunting licence. During World War I, Salmon served in the King's African Rifles, being awarded a Military Cross for gallantry. In 1924, in an effort to combat the destruction to cropping and fencing caused by elephant that prevented the development of agriculture, the Ugandan Government created the Uganda Game Department and appointed Salmon as one of four white elephant control wardens, along with Deaf Banks and Pete Pearson. In the course of his duties Salmon shot as many as 4,000 elephant, more than anyone else in history, he predominatly used a pair of .416 Rigby bolt action rifles, but also used a .470 Nitro Express double rifle if hunting in thick cover. In 1930 Salmon was appointed chief game warden of Uganda, remaining in that position until his retirement in 1949, during that time he was successful in extending the boundaries of Uganda's national parks and creating a number of additional game preserves. =Frederick Selous= Illustration from A hunter's wanderings in Africa Frederick Courtney Selous (1851–1917) was an English born hunter, explorer, soldier and writer.

In 1897 Sharpe succeeded Johnston as consul of the British Central Africa Protectorate, later becoming the first governor of Nyasaland until his retirement in 1910. Whilst in the colonial service and after his retirement, Sharpe never lost his interest in hunting and whenever the opportunity arose he would go on long expeditions from central Africa into the Congo, from East Africa to Rhodesia, mainly to hunt elephant, the Sharpe's grysbok, Sharpe's greenbul and Sharpe's pied-babbler are all named after him. Between 1887 and 1892 Sharpe used an 8 bore double rifle and a single barrelled 4 bore, whilst in 1893 he acquired his first bolt actioned rifle, preferring them to doubles from that time on due to the availability for more than two shots. Sharpe hunted extensively with a .333 Jeffery and a .404 Jeffery, on an expedition in 1916 he used a .600 Nitro Express double rifle but discarded it after an incident involving four elephants, having shot the first two he was charged by the remaining animals before he had time to reload. =Major C.H. Stigand= Major Chauncey Hugh Stigand (1877–1919) was a British soldier, colonial administrator and big game hunter. Serving in Burma, British Somaliland, British East Africa and the Sudan, Stigand was a keen big game hunter who took greater risks than most hunters and often came close to being fatally injured. Stigand was gored in the chest by a rhino, mauled by a wounded lion that he was following up in the dark, tusked through the leg by an elephant that he was trying to drive out of a garden (without a rifle) and was knocked to the ground by another wounded elephant which stood over him bleeding whilst he lay hidden. Stigand once crawled into a cave after another wounded lion which, luckily for him, had died by the time he reached it. Stigand wrote several books including Hunting the elephant in Africa and The game of British East Africa, he usually used a .256 Mannlicher for elephants, rhinoceros, lion, buffalo and smaller game, he also used an old big bore .450 Nitro Express double rifle which he usually had a gun bearer carry for him. =Jim Sutherland= Sutherland with ivory, Ubangi-Shari 1925.

Unlike \\"Karamojo\\" Bell, Sutherland preferred heavy calibre rifles for elephant and rhinoceros hunting, his favourite rifle being a Westley Richards single-trigger Droplock double rifle in .577 Nitro Express, he also used with a bolt action .318 Westley Richards for open country where quarry was difficult to approach and longer ranged shots were required. In 1912 he wrote an account of his exploits to that date, The adventures of an elephant hunter, upon his return to London in 1913 he was feted as the \\"World's greatest elephant hunter\\". Sutherland is considered one of the most successful of Africa's professional elephant hunters. =Colonel H.G.C.

Taylor experimented widely with different types of hunting rifles, cartridges and bullet types throughout his career, his books African rifles and cartridges and Big game and big game rifles explore the practical application of bullet ballistics and type including articulating the \\"Taylor KO factor\\" to calculate the \\"knock out\\" value (a \\"knock out\\" meant that the elephant was sufficiently stunned by the hit that he would not immediately turn on the hunter) of cartridges and bullet types. Taylor's writings also discuss numerous American, British and European cartridges as well as rifle actions with comparative notes on double rifles, magazine rifles and single- shot rifles. In his writings Taylor expresses a preference for double rifles and makes particular mention of the .275 No 2 Magnum, the .300 H&H; Magnum, the .333 Jeffery, the .375 H&H; Magnum, the .450/400 Nitro Express (both the 3 inch and 3¼ inch versions), the .416 Rigby, the .450 No 2 Nitro Express, the .500/465 Nitro Express, the .470 Nitro Express and the .600 Nitro Express.

Anderson wrote several books about Indian wildlife, hunting and the locals of the jungle including Nine maneaters and one rogue, his observations about wildlife include the first account of a pack of dhole killing a tiger. Anderson usually hunted alone, his preferred method of hunting man-eaters was to sit in a machan over a bait, usually a cow or goat but on occasion the corpse of one of the man-eater’s victims. Anderson hunted predominantly with a Winchester Model 1895 chambered in .405 Winchester and a double-barreled 12 bore shotgun, one barrel loaded with L.G. shot, the other with a solid slug. =Sir Samuel Baker= Baker being chased by an elephant. Sir Samuel White Baker (1821–1893) was an English explorer, soldier, naturalist, big game hunter, engineer, writer and abolitionist.

Gallwey was the son of Sir William Payne-Gallwey, 1st Baronet and served in the 90th Regiment of Foot (Perthshire Volunteers). Gallwey is said to have killed between 700 and 1,300 elephants in Ceylon, depending on the source, in elephant control efforts. In the 1840s, the government of Ceylon offered rewards of 7-10 shillings for the killing of an elephant due to the destruction they caused to crops. =Sultan Ibrahim I of Johor= Sultan Ibrahim I of Johor (1873–1959) was the 22nd Sultan of Johor.

In 1895 Cooper returned to Melville Island as Robinson's manager, he was speared in the shoulder but abducted four Tiwi islanders, escaping with them to the mainland. Befriending his captives and learning their language, in 1905 Cooper returned with them and twenty aborigines from Port Essington and settled on the island. Cooper remained on Melville Island for ten years, shooting over 1000 buffalo a year for their hides and horns as well as cutting Cyprus pine and fishing for trepang.

Europe =William the Conqueror= William I (c.1028–1087) was King of England from 1066 to 1087. Few hunting details have survived about William except that he was a keen huntsman whose introduction of royal forests and forest law to England (including the creation of the New Forest) have left an enduring impact on the ecology of that country to the present day. William of Malmesbury stated William’s hunting was a form of relaxation to escape the pressures of daily business, the chronicler Ordericus Vitalis wrote that William enjoyed his regular hunting expeditions to the Forest of Dean and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle stated he loved the red deer \\"as if he were their father.\\" John Manwood listed the five animals protected by law for the early Norman kings as the hart, hind (both red deer), boar, hare and wolf, and it is assumed from the few hunting accounts of William's sons that the royal hunt was conducted on horseback with hounds. The royal accounts of 1136 from Henry I detail payments to over 100 hunt servants and archers as well as payments for numerous horses and hounds, the hounds were divided into the wolf pack, the king's pack and the main pack, the first two for the king's recreational hunting, the last for use by royal servants for supplying game to the royal table. =Louis XV of France= Louis XV stag hunting in the Forest at Saint Germain-en-Lay. Louis XV (1710–1774) was King of France from 1715 to 1774. To the King hunting was an all-absorbing affair, in 1722 he drove from his coronation to his first hunt in the Villers-Cotterêts forest and by 1725 he hunted 276 days in the year and in that same year he was at the death of 362 kills, having ridden 3,121 leagues (12,166 km) behind his hounds. The King hunted with a huge pack of hounds called The Great Pack, made up of 40 to 90 couples (80 to 180 hounds) of different breeds, the number increasing during his reign. The pack was actually three packs divided between the game hunted, wild boar, wolf and red deer, and employed a staff of over 500 noblemen (each being on duty for 3 months at a time) and 250 horses, with a further 2,000 horses available for the use by the King, his courtiers and guests. Between 1743 and 1767 the kills of red deer alone by the Great Pack was 2,651 stags. =Victor Emmanuel II of Italy= Victor Emmanuel II (1820–1878) was King of Sardinia from 1849 to 1861 and King of Italy from 1861 to 1878. The King is credited with saving the Alpine ibex from extirpation from the Alps by creating the Royal Hunting Reserve of the Gran Paradiso in 1856. At the time of its creation there were estimated to be only 60 animals remaining in the Alps, the creation of the park and the appointment of a staff of 55 game keepers to watch and ward the remaining animals saw their numbers climb to between 500 and 1,000 head by 1877, this in spite of the King shooting on average 50 head a year. In 1920 the Royal Hunting Reserve formed the basis of Gran Paradiso National Park by which time it held over 4,000 head of ibex. An enthusiastic alpine sportsman, the King is believed to have shot around 232 male ibex, 22 female ibex and over 700 chamois in his life. =Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha= Ernest II (1818–1893) was the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 1844 to 1893. The Duke held various extensive sporting estates including Reinhardsbrunn near Gotha, Schloss Rosenau near Coburg, an estate at Hinterriß and a boar forest in Alsace and much of his year was spent hunting; he was also a frequent guest of his brother Prince Albert at Balmoral Castle. The Duke shot 3,283 red deer and over 2,000 chamois in his life, as well as numerous boar, roe deer and small game, much of the shooting was stalked although in the forests of Thuringia the deer was usually driven and as the Duke aged, the chamois at Hinterriß were also driven. The Duke's favourite rifle was a .450 Black Powder Express by Alexander Henry with which he shot running deer out to . =John George I, Elector of Saxony= John George I (1585–1656) was the Elector of Saxony from 1611 to 1656. The Electors of Saxony were by ancient hereditary \\"Lord High Masters of the Chase\\" of the Holy Roman Empire, and John George I and his son John George II were possibly the greatest slaughterers of big game in history. Over the course of his life John George I shot 35,421 red deer, 1,045 fallow deer, 11,489 roe deer, 31,902 wild boar, 238 bears, 3,872 wolves, 217 lynxes, 12,047 hares, 19,015 foxes, 37 beavers, 930 badgers, 81 otters and 149 wild cats. These huge numbers of game were killed by a system of elaborate palisades and hundreds of game beaters who drove the game in enormous numbers to within range of the hunters and their still primitive muzzleloading firearms. John George I was also an enthusiastic organizer of area blood sports for the amusement of his court, using the great open market of Dresden as the stage he would pit aurochs brought from Poland against bears or wild boar and stag against wolves and occasionally the Elector would enter the arena himself to dispatch an animal with a spear, these events usually culminated in members of court participating in some fox tossing. It is said that John George I rejected the offer of the throne of Bohemia because the deer in Bohemia were smaller and fewer than those of Saxony. =John George II, Elector of Saxony= John George II (1613–1680) was Elector of Saxony from 1656 to 1680. John George II followed his father's love of slaughtering huge numbers of driven game, over the course of his life he shot 43,649 red deer, 2,062 fallow deer, 16,864 roe deer, 22,298 wild boar, 239 bears, 2,195 wolves, 191 lynxes, 16,966 hares, 2,740 foxes, 597 beavers, 1,045 badgers, 180 otters and 292 wild cats. In 1665 John George II rebuilt at enormous expense a high palisade fence originally built by his ancestor Augustus, Elector of Saxony in the preceding century and had fallen into disrepair. The fence ran the entire length of the border between Saxony and Bohemia and was rebuilt to prevent the Elector's stags from straying from his country. =James VI and I of Scotland and England= James VI and I (1566-1625) was King of Scotland as James VI from 1567 to 1625 and King of England and Ireland as James I from 1603 to 1625. James' reign was marked by his passion for hunting, he reimposed many previously relaxed game and forest laws, took a close interest in the royal forests and claimed the royal right to hunt all game all over England. Providing James with good days hunting was seen as a valuable way to curry favour with the king, although his secretaries often complained of delays in getting his signature due to his frequent lengthy absences hunting and various foreign ambassadors were on occasion kept waiting for weeks while James was away on an extended hunting trip. James born small and unable to walk properly or hold himself upright without experiencing pain in his legs, but he had considerable stamina mounted and he maintained to his couriers and ministers his need to hunt frequently to protect his health. James usually hunted stag and hare mounted with a pack of hounds. =Alfonso de Urquijo= Urquijo (front) with the Duke of Peñaranda and a Sable antelope, Mozambique, 1967 Alfonso de Urquijo (1920–1994) was a Spanish big game hunter, writer and banker. Born in one of the most illustrious families of Spain, he was introduced to hunting from young age. His hunting adventures were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II and his enlistment to the Blue Division, for which he fought throughout the Winter campaign of 1941–42, achieving the rank of Lieutenant. Urquijo was a great expert in botany, a country lover and particularly fond of hunting, who suddenly found in the Aragonese Pyrenees the paradise of his hobby, although he also toured much of the world in pursuit of the most beautiful and remote hunting species. He was one of the first Spaniards to organise an expedition to the then territory of the Spanish Sahara, on the back of a camel. He was a prolific hunting writer, as well as of customs of the countries he visited. He published a large collection of biographical works, primarily of his hunting expeditions, and listed the 1,143 fincas or hunting estates that existed in Spain at the time. Already in the fullness of his life, he acquired the famous finca \\"Nava el Sach\\" in Sierra Morena, which he managed in an exemplary way, making it a meeting place for the great international hunters. In addition, he was a member of the Royal Spanish Hunting Federation, and a member of the National Board of Homologation of Hunting Trophies and introduced the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC) in Spain, an international body of which he was president for three years (1981-1984).

At the age of 14 Collier ran away to follow his owners, Howell and Thomas Hinds, into the Confederate Army (against their express orders because of his age), he was the only black man to serve in the Confederate Army from Mississippi, later serving in the 9th Texas Cavalry Regiment. After the war Collier worked briefly as a cowboy in Texas before returning to Mississippi and to hunting, he is credited with killing over 3,000 bears, hunting bears and cougars with a pack of hounds. Collier gained national fame when he took Theodore Roosevelt bear hunting, having promised a bear for Roosevelt he single-handedly captured and tied a large black bear to a tree, Roosevelt's refusal to shoot the bear as unsportsmanlike led the press to coin the nickname \\"Teddy bear\\". =General Wade Hampton= Lieutenant General Wade Hampton (1818–1902) was a Confederate soldier, South Carolina politician and plantation owner. Inheriting a significant fortune and significant landholdings in South Carolina and Mississippi, Hampton was a very keen hunter of wild game on his plantations, particularly one plantation located near Greenville in northern Mississippi. Over the course of his life Hampton is thought to have been at the death of over 500 black bears, at least two thirds of which he killed himself, and a similar number of deer. Hampton did all of his hunting mounted on horseback with a large pack of Southern American Foxhounds, with which in addition to bears and deer he killed around 16 cougars, several wolf as well as lynx and grey fox. Hampton was described by Theodore Roosevelt as \\"the mightiest hunter America has ever seen\\", he usually shot his prey after the hounds had brought it to bay, although he also killed 30-40 bear by hand with a knife, letting the hounds distract the bear whilst he walked up behind it to stab its throat. =Ernest Hemingway= Hemingway posing with a buffalo on safari in 1933. Ernest Miller Hemingway (1899–1961) was an American novelist, short story writer, journalist and sportsman. Introduced to fishing and hunting by his father when he was four years old, Hemingway maintained a lifelong love of both pursuits, trout fishing and duck shooting in various locations, deep sea fishing for marlin and tuna in the Gulf Stream and big game hunting in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming as well as conducting two safaris in East Africa with Philip Percival as his guide. Hemingway shot brown bear, black bear, wapiti, deer and bighorn sheep in America and lion, leopard, rhinoceros, buffalo, kudu, roan antelope, zebra and numerous gazelle in East Africa, his sporting experiences gave him material for many of his short stories and novels. Hemingway hunted with a 6.5x54mm Mannlicher-Schönauer and a .30-06 Springfield sporter both by Griffin & Howe, a 10.75×68mm Mauser, a .470 Nitro Express double rifle and a .577 Nitro Express double rifle by Westley Richards (with which he also hoped to sink a German U-boat during World War II) as well as several .22 Rimfire rifles and shotguns for small game hunting. =Agnes Herbert= Agnes Elsie Diana Herbert (née Thorpe) (c.1880–1960) was a Manx writer, traveller and sportswoman. Raised on the Isle of Man, Herbert found the prospect of a life of domesticity confining so, with her cousin Cecily Baird, she set out for the Canadian Rockies where the pair taught English cookery to Chinese kitchen workers and gained their first exposure to big game hunting. Upon their return to Britain the cousins secretly began planning a solely sporting expedition, this time to Africa. In 1906 the pair arrived in Somaliland, shooting numerous game including lion, rhinoceros and various antelope, Herbert was mauled by a lion and one of her native guides was killed by a rhinoceros. The pair conducted two more major sporting expeditions, one to Alaska where they hunted bear, walrus, caribou, Dall sheep and moose and another to the Caucasus where they hunted tur, bear, ibex, deer and wild boar, Herbert published an account of all three trips. For their trip to Somaliland, an uncle provided them with a battery of rifles from his personal collection, including three 12 bore rifles, two .500 Black Powder Express double rifles, a .35 Winchester repeater and two 12 bore double-barrelled shikar pistols. Herbert's favourite rifle was a 12 bore firing soft spherical bullets and 5½ drams (9.7 g) of powder which she considered ideal for lion and other dangerous game. For the Alaskan trip the pair took a .256 Mannlicher, a .375 Flanged Nitro Express double rifle and two .450 Nitro Express rifles, for the Caucasus trip they took .256 Mannlicher rifles and a pair of 12 bore shotguns. =Elmer Keith= Elmer Merrifield Keith (1899–1984) was an Idaho rancher, firearms enthusiast, author and sportsman. Keith became known as a regular contributor to Guns & Ammo magazine as well as authoring a number of books on rifles, pistols, hunting and shooting. Keith lived in the wilds within hiking distance of bear, wapiti, deer, mountain goat and moose, from boyhood he hunted these and other American big game species including caribou, bighorn sheep, dall sheep, antelope, bison, arctic game, cougar and jaguar, making frequent hunting trips to the remotest parts of British Columbia, Alberta, Alaska and the Yukon. An expert on shooting pistols and hunting rifles, Keith’s preference was for cartridges with a caliber of and heavy-for-caliber bullets from up, for African big game hunting he used a .476 Nitro Express double rifle by Westley Richards and a .500 Nitro Express by Charles Boswell. Keith designed and used many unique cartridges for his North American hunting pursuits, his wildcat rifle cartridges are seen to have influenced the development of many modern hunting cartridges including the .338-06, .338-378 Weatherby Magnum and .340 Weatherby Magnum, he is credited with inspiring Winchester to develop the .338 Winchester Magnum. =Jack O'Connor= John Woolf \\"Jack\\" O'Connor (1902–1978) was an American author, outdoorsman and big game hunter. After a brief Army career, O'Connor commenced teaching whilst moonlighting as a reporter. Moving on to writing magazine articles about hunting and rifles, he became best known as a writer for and later the shooting editor of Outdoor Life magazine, he also wrote several books about hunting, shooting and game animals. Over the course of his life O'Connor shot among other animals brown bear, black bear, cougar, bighorn sheep, dall sheep, mountain goat, moose, wapiti, caribou, deer and pronghorn in North America; lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros, buffalo, kudu, sable antelope, oryx and various other antelope in Africa; tiger, ibex, urial, red sheep and blackbuck in Asia. O'Connor used and wrote very highly of the .257 Roberts, 7x57mm Mauser, .30-06 Springfield, .375 H&H; Magnum, .416 Rigby and the .450 Watts Magnum, although for North American hunting he was an advocate of lighter flatter shooting projectiles and his name is synonymous with the .270 Winchester, his favourite cartridge. =Theodore Roosevelt= Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919) was an American statesman, author, soldier, big game hunter, naturalist and President of the United States. An extremely enthusiastic hunter-naturalist, before his presidency Roosevelt hunted extensively during his ranching days, writing several books about these experiences including Hunting trips of a ranchman, Ranch life and the hunting trail and The wilderness hunter. Throughout his life Roosevelt strove to save wildlife through the protection of natural habitat, during his political career he quadrupled the acreage of America’s public forests, he built the United States Forest Service which came to administer one twelfth of the land of the United States and he created 55 wildlife refuges, expanded national parks, organized conservation conferences, and popularized a sensibility of respect for nature and preservation of the wilderness. After his presidency Roosevelt embarked on two major hunting expeditions to collect international wildlife specimens for American museums, the 1909–10 Smithsonian–Roosevelt African Expedition to East Africa to collect for the National Museum of Natural History and the 1914–15 Roosevelt–Rondon Scientific Expedition to the Paraguayan and the Brazilian Amazon to collect for the American Museum of Natural History. Over the course of his life Roosevelt shot cougar, grizzly bear, black bear, buffalo, moose, wapiti, caribou, white tailed deer, black tailed deer, mountain goat, big horn sheep and pronghorn in North America; lion, hyena, elephant, white rhinoceros, black rhinoceros, hippopotamus, zebra, giraffe, warthog, eland, oryx, roan antelope, wildebeest, topi, waterbuck, lechwe, hartebeest, kob, impala, gerenuk and gazelle in Africa; jaguar, tapir, peccary and wood deer in South America as well as numerous smaller game in all three continents. In his early days in the American West, Roosevelt hunted with a heavy .45-120 Sharps rifle and an English .500 Black Powder Express double rifle, due to their weight cumbersome nature he promptly swapped both for a .40-90 Sharps rifle, a .50-115 Bullard express 6 shot repeater and a Winchester Model 1876 chambered in .45-75 Winchester (a favourite). In later years he used a M1903 Springfield chambered in .30-03 (another favourite), which he supplemented for his African expedition with a Winchester Model 1895 chambered in .405 Winchester and a .500/450 Nitro Express double rifle by Holland & Holland. =Townsend Whelen= Colonel Townsend \\"Townie\\" Whelen (1877–1961) was an American soldier, hunter, writer, outdoorsman and rifleman. Retiring from a career in the Army in 1936, Whelen became a leading outdoor writer, contributing to various sporting publications including American Rifleman, Field and Stream, Guns & Ammo, Outdoor Life and Sports Afield, as well as writing a number of books on hunting and firearms. Whelen hunted all his life, taking his first deer in 1892 and his last 66 years later, over his life he shot numerous big game animals including brown bear, black bear, moose, wapiti, caribou, white tailed deer, mule deer, black tailed deer, bighorn sheep and mountain goat all over Canada, throughout the Rocky Mountains and in the Adirondacks. Whelen developed a number of rifle cartridges based on the .30-06 Springfield, including the .25 Whelen, .35 Whelen, .375 Whelen and the .400 Whelen. South America =Sasha Siemel= Alexander \\"Sasha\\" Siemel (1890–1970) was a Latvian born South American adventurer, guide, actor, writer and jaguar hunter. At a young age, Siemel followed his brother Ernest to Argentina, in 1914 he moved on to the Pantanal of Brazil. Killing his first jaguar (with a spear) in 1925, Siemel became a bounty hunter for ranchers who had suffered severe losses of cattle to jaguar predation. An avid self-promoter, Siemel was famous in his own lifetime through numerous newsreels and articles, in 1953 he published a very popular autobiography Tigrero!. Siemel played a role in the 1937 series Jungle Menace and he was the subject of an abortive mid-1950s film project starring John Wayne (as Siemel) and Ava Gardner before filming was abruptly stopped whilst in the Amazon. Siemel hunted jaguars with a spear, a bow and arrows and with a rifle, using a pack of hounds to locate his quarry. By 1948, Siemel had killed 281 jaguars, 30 with a spear, 111 with a bow and arrows and the remainder with a rifle, as well as capturing 22 alive, this was 7 years before his retirement from hunting and it is believed he killed over 300 jaguars in his life.

Wills, a company which (building on the successful tobacco business established by their father) by the late 1800s had become Britain's largest importer of tobacco and manufacturer of tobacco products. Origins Henry Overton Wills II was born on 3 July 1800 in Bristol, the younger of the two sons of Henry Overton Wills I (1761-1826) by his wife Ann Day. In 1786 his Salisbury-born father, with his partner Samuel Watkins, had opened a tobacco shop in Bristol, which grew into a successful business. Career Henry and his elder brother William Day Wills in 1815 joined their father's firm, and became co-owners of the company in 1826 when he died. In 1830 the brothers founded W.D. & H.O. Wills, which grew to become the leading importer of tobacco, and manufacturer of tobacco products in late 19th-century Britain. In 1859 Henry made his son Edward Payson Wills a partner in the firm, who succeeded to his father's interests in the company. H.O. Wills II entered local politics in 1845 as a City Councillor for the St. Pauls district of Bristol and he continued to serve on the town council for several years until hearing problems forced him to retire from public duties. He also served in 1856 as Justice of the Peace. He was also an active a supporter of the Congregationalist faith, and he and his brother William were founder trustees in 1841 of the Hanham Chapel and in 1843 of the Barton Hill Chapel, both located in the Bristol suburbs.

Announced in December 2017, it is supposed to be backed by the country's oil and mineral reserves, and is intended to supplement Venezuela's plummeting bolívar fuerte ('strong bolívar') currency, as a means of circumventing U.S. sanctions and accessing international financing. On 20 August 2018, the bolívar soberano ('sovereign bolívar') was introduced, with the government stating it would be linked to the petro coin value. History Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro announced the petro in a televised address on 3 December 2017, stating that it would be backed by Venezuela's reserves of oil, gasoline, gold, and diamonds. Maduro stated that the petro would allow Venezuela to \\"advance in issues of monetary sovereignty\\", and that it would make \\"new forms of international financing\\" available to the country. Opposition leaders, however, expressed doubt due to Venezuela's economic turmoil, pointing to the falling value of the Venezuelan bolívar, its fiat currency, and $140 billion in foreign debt. On 5 January 2018, Maduro announced that Venezuela would issue 100 million tokens of the petro, which would put the value of the entire issuance at just over $6 billion. It also established a cryptocurrency government advisory group called VIBE to act as \\"an institutional, political and legal base\\" from which to launch the petro. Carlos Vargas is the \\"Superintendent of Cryptocurrencies\\". Also in January, as a response to the petro, Venezuela's National Assembly, headed by the opposition Democratic Unity Roundtable, declared the petro to be an illegal debt issuance by a government desperate for cash, and has said it will not recognize it. In a document leaked to and reviewed by Reuters, VIBE recommended that the government sell $2.3 billion worth of petros in a private offering at a discount of up to 60%, indicating that \\"Maduro’s valuation of the nascent petro faces significant market skepticism\\", followed by $2.7 billion worth of petros offered to the public a month later, with the remainder \\"shared between the government and VIBE\\". It also suggested that the government accept tax payments in petros as well as allow PDVSA, the country's state-owned oil company, incorporate cryptocurrencies in its dealings with foreign companies. =Launch= The petro's pre-sale started on 20 February 2018 at -04:00 UTC and ended on 19 March 2018 at -04:00 UTC. 38.4 million tokens were made available. The government stated the pre-sale raised US$3.3 billion, though according to Steve Hanke no independent audits were made to verify this claim. The technological identity of petro was perplexing during its genesis. Initially, the white paper of petro stated that the currency would be on the Ethereum platform, but the white paper was changed at launch and the platform was to be NEM. However, even after the launch, white papers in various languages still shared conflicting information as to which platform the petro was part of. In October 2018, the white paper was changed once again, and a core developer of Ethereum, Joey Zhou, stated that the new petro white paper blatantly plagiarized from the GitHub repository of Dash. The newest version of the white paper revealed that petro was a clone, effectively a fork, of the cryptocurrency Dash, theoretically debunking the idea that petro was built on a separate blockchain platform. Due to the unorganized launch by the Venezuelan government, scammers were able to establish their own \\"petro\\" currencies on various cryptocurrency platforms, though these schemes did not garner much success. The second phase of the petro launch involves a public sale of 44 million tokens. =Petro gold= On 21 February 2018, petro gold, a gold-backed cryptocurrency, was announced in a televised speech given by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. It was not clear whether the gold backing the tokens would be actual gold reserves or some kind of share of the country's untapped mineral wealth. =Currency reform= In August 2018, the Maduro government carried out a currency reform, centered around replacing the old bolivar fuerte currency with the bolívar soberano. One bolívar soberano is worth a hundred thousand bolivar fuerte. Under the country's fixed exchange rate to the US dollar the new currency is devalued by roughly 95% compared to the old bolivar fuerte. Additionally, the new bolívar soberano has a fixed exchange rate to the petro, with a rate of 3,600 bolívares soberanos to one petro. The petro's fixed exchange to barrels of oil is one to one (the market value was approximately US$60 at the time of the reforms). As part of the reforms Venezuelans will be paid at least 0.5 petros a month. Following the reform, Reuters investigated the petro six months after its ICO. When visiting the Venezuelan Ministry of Finance headquarters in Caracas, the Superintendent of Cryptocurrencies did not have an office there and their promoted website did not exist. The Atapirire parish, where President Maduro specifically decreed the petro's value would be linked to oil reserves in the area, has seen no petroleum-related activities and the oil rigs in the area appeared small, old and abandoned. Experts in economics stated that it was impossible to link the petro to the bolívar soberano because no one knows its legitimate value. Though \\"reservations\\" were sold by the Venezuelan government to obtain petros, no petros had been released by the Venezuelan government. Design The design of the petro by the Venezuelan government has been controversial, with white paper changing by the day even after the petro's pre-sale. Petros were 100% \\"pre-mined\\" by the Venezuelan government, meaning that new tokens cannot be created after the issuance. Members of the Venezuelan Ministry of University Education, Science and Technology allegedly under advisory of the Russian government designed the petro to circumvent United States sanctions, with Russian president Vladimir Putin denying official involvement. On 1 October 2018, the cryptocurrency switched to an X11 algorithm-based design, which was copied from Dash. =Transactions= During the ICO petros could only be purchased from the Venezuelan government with Russian rubles, Bitcoin, NEM and Ethereum. The minimum required investment to acquire the crypto-asset is 50 euros (or its equivalent) per digital wallet or 1000 euros (or its equivalent) per bank deposits. Venezuela legally allows and encourages the use of petro for virtually any payment including oil trade, taxes, fees, real estate, gasoline, flights and more. It is not actually possible to purchase anything with petros, none have been issued; there has never been a single purchase of any kind whatsoever, by anyone, using the petro.\\" =Price and volatility= Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings states that the white paper shows no method as to how the Venezuelan government will base the petro on oil prices, concluding that the currency \\"is a worthless token\\". But according to the white paper, the base price of the petro is equivalent to the price of a single Venezuelan oil barrel: 1 petro = 1 oil barrel. The official Venezuelan oil price is defined by the Venezuelan Ministry of Oil and Mining and the current price of the petro (during the ICO) is referenced on its web page. According to the official white paper, national and international licensed exchanges will be able to sell and exchange the petro, allowing the market to define its price. While there is no mechanism to exchange petros for any other currency yet, the government is expected to back each petro with the value of one oil barrel obtained specifically from the Atapirire parish of Anzoátegui to be exchanged into bolivares or other currencies. However, President Maduro has made contradictory statements saying that the petro's worth may be determined solely by market value. Reception =United States= The United States Department of the Treasury warned that participating in Venezuela's proposed initial coin offering for the petro cryptocurrency could violate U.S. sanctions against Venezuela, because it \\"would appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government\\". President Donald Trump signed an executive order prohibiting transactions in any Venezuelan government-issued cryptocurrency by a United States person or within the United States, effective 19 March 2018, after claiming it was designed to obfuscate US sanctions and access international financing. Others Center-right Brookings Institution stated that \\"it is relatively unsurprising that a dictatorship with little reserve currency ... has resorted to a deceitful means like introducing the petro ... [t]he petro ... exists to create foreign currency reserves from thin air\\", further explaining that the creation of the petro has tarnished the reputation of cryptocurrencies and that sanctioned countries \\"might pursue the same fraudulent strategy as Venezuela: create a cryptocurrency tied to a government-controlled asset, raise money in violation of sanctions, and proceed to manipulate that cryptocurrency’s value to maximize profit\\". =Financial= The cryptocurrency community's response was generally negative. Economist Jean Paul Leidenz expressed concerns that the creation of the petro would encourage further hyperinflation. Supply-side economist Steve Hanke, who studies hyperinflation in Venezuela from the perspective of supply-side economics, stated that the petro was likely to wind up \\"in the graveyard\\", later saying of the petro, \\"It doesn’t exist. The whole thing is a sham, a fraud. It was rolled out in January, and it doesn’t trade. It is not considered by those who rate cryptocurrencies as even a cryptocurrency.\\" Other analysts point to its government control or centralisation as its greatest weakness. Financial journalist Max Keiser expressed his support in light of the country's hyperinflation. According to Bloomberg, the organizations that rank cryptocurrencies have described the petro as a \\"scam\\", with sites like ICOindex, ICObench, Cryptorated and ICOreview giving negative reviews or not even rating the petro due to its status. Initially, from its white paper which was released in January 2018, the petro was missing some important information regarding its mechanism to its technology. After a couple of weeks, a new version of the white paper was released which announced a different blockchain platform on which the petro would be built. Investment The Washington Post economic reporter Matt O'Brien said that \\"The petro might be the most obviously horrible investment ever... The petro is about creating something useless that's why only foreigners can buy them, but only Venezuelans can spend them\\".

In 1965, she graduated with a master's thesis on \\"The Role of Broadcasting in Africa with Special Emphasis on West Africa\\" her studies in broadcasting, television and film at the University of Michigan. However, her dream of working as a documentary filmmaker on television proved to be unrealizable: \\"My job interview at CBS or NBC was such that the gentlemen asked me, 'What do you mean, why we hire women here?' That was a rhetorical question - and the answer: 'Yes, as a cleaning woman and as secretaries.' \\"Pionierin der deutschen Frauenbewegung. In: Deutschlandfunk Kultur. (1 February 2017) In 1965 Schultz taught at Rust College in Holly Springs, Mississippi. In 1966/67 she went to Puerto Rico, where she worked in the Anti- Poverty Programs of the Office of Economic Opportunity. From 1969 to 1970, she taught seminars on women's studies and on race and class at Columbia College Chicago and was active in the women’s movement. In 1972 Schultz was awarded a Ph.D. at University of Wisconsin–Madison. In 1973 she returned to Germany and taught women's studies and cultural and immigration issues at the John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies at the Free University of Berlin. Alongside, she established together with a few fellow campaigners a book publishing house specialized on feminist literature and a feminist women's health center in 1974. As a visiting professor, she taught sociology of education at State University of New York in 1981. In 1984, she helped civil rights activist and poet Audre Lorde, whom she got to know at the 1980 UN World Conference on Women in Copenhagen, to become a visiting professor at FU Berlin. In 1989 she habilitated at the Institute of Sociology of the Free University of Berlin. In 1991, Schultz followed the call for a professorship for \\"Social and Educational Work with Women\\" at the Department of Social Work and Social Education of Alice Salomon University of Applied Sciences Berlin, where she remained until her retirement in 2004.Die Anfänge der Frauenstudien an der ASFH.

The regiment was mobilised at Yeomanry House in August 1914 before being deployed to Gallipoli and, ultimately, to the Western Front. After the Hertfordshire Yeomanry converted to artillery and the Hertfordshire Regiment's drill hall at Port Hill was withdrawn from use, Yeomanry House became the main drill hall in the town. Following the re-organisation of the Territorial Army in 1967, 5th (Hertfordshire) Company, 5th (Volunteer) Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment was formed in Hertford in 1969.

They are known as a prolific live act, having toured the European continent numerous times, and have released three full-length albums internationally. The Sonic Dawn describe their sound as \\"a psychedelic mixture of styles, from jazzy sitar pop to heavy acid rock.\\" They have recently appeared alongside artists such as Graveyard and Brant Bjork.  Biography  The band was formed in Copenhagen by Emil Bureau (guitar, vocals), Jonas Waaben (drums, perc., backing vocals) and Niels Fuglede (bass guitar) in the summer 2013. Initially the group was named The Mind Flowers, which was later changed to The Sonic Dawn, because of legal issues with ownership of the name in the United States. Following their first concert 9 January 2014, in Copenhagen, the band was signed by the local psychedelia and stoner rock label, Levitation Records (now defunct). The record debut was a 7-inch vinyl split featuring their single Down the Line, released in May 2014. The single aired on national radio in Denmark, but failed to chart. Same year the band toured Denmark, performing with Spids Nøgenhat, label mates The Hedgehogs and more. In 2015, The Sonic Dawn expanded to Europe, with tour dates abroad in Germany, France, The Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Via these touring efforts The Sonic Dawn landed their first international record deal with German Nasoni Records, known for releasing Colour Haze among others, who released Perception on 31 October 2015. Musically, the album can be described as a mix of rock and blues songwriting, with a psychedelic sound. It prominently features the Swedish organist Erik 'Errka' Petersson on keys, a studio collaboration that continued on the group's next album as well. While Perception did not gain the interest of mainstream media, it established The Sonic Dawn as a name in the underground, one such critic speculating that The Sonic Dawn might be \\"the next big band of the current retro rock wave\\" (Eclipsed Rock Magazine, March 2016). Nasoni printed two limited editions of the LP on colored vinyl, which are both sold out. A remastered audiophile edition, cut at Abbey Road Studios in London, was released in late 2017. Upon Perception's release the band toured Europe extensively. One notable performance was their opening of Freak Valley Festival 2016, sharing the stage with Graveyard, Dead Meadow and others. On 21 April 2017, The Sonic Dawn released the second album, Into the Long Night, on Italian Heavy Psych Sounds, record label of Nick Oliveri (former Queens of the Stone Age) and Nebula. The album was recorded during one month's isolation in a remote house by the North Sea in Denmark. A mini documentary by filmmaker Bolette Søs covers the unusual recording process. The song l'Espion charted on Danish national radio, two weeks as No. 1 on DR P3's music chart, Barometerlisten, remaining in rotation for eight weeks total. Also in Sweden the album got some national airplay, while underground radio shows and podcasts continued their interest in the band's psychedelic sound. On the release date Uffe Lorenzen (Baby Woodrose's front man) opened for The Sonic Dawn with a solo set. As an album Into the Long Night is more explorative and varied in sound, showing both a more sensitive and jazzy quality, while taking the psychedelic aspect further at the same time, as noted by several critics, with Classic Rock Magazine stating that \\"Denmark is entering the world market for psychedelic drugs.\\" The album explores a wider instrumentation, notably featuring Danish jazz legend Morten Grønvad on vibraphone and percussion. Upon the release of into the Long Night, The Sonic Dawn played around 60 European shows, including 15 dates with Brant Bjork (formerly of Kyuss and Fu Manchu), who handpicked them as tour support on his Mankind Woman album tour. On 1 February 2019, The Sonic Dawn's third album, Eclipse, was released on Heavy Psych Sounds Records. Their biggest work to date, with the album's 13 tracks picked among over 40 candidates, according to the group itself. Reviewers called it \\"one of the best psychedelic pop albums of the decade\\" and \\"The Sonic Dawn’s preliminary masterpiece\\". The album was recorded to tape at The Village Recording in Copenhagen with producer, Thomas Vang, known for his work with Roger Waters. The album singles Forever 1969 and Psychedelic Ranger received moderate national airplay across Europe. The Sonic Dawn toured Europe for five weeks in the spring 2019 and has announced two weeks of fall/winter tour, in support of Eclipse..

In 1990, their version of \\"Allons à Lafayette\\" (a song first recorded in 1928 by Joe Falcon and Cléoma Breaux) reached No. 30 in the Dutch singles chart. The band was still active . History Captain Gumbo was formed by (diatonic accordion and vocals), Hans Soeteman (bassist in the band RoToR), Joost Witte (drummer) and Gerard de Braconier (guitarist) (two members of the band ). Soeteman was soon replaced by (who later became known as a filmmaker); who was later replaced by Nico Heilijgers; who was himself later replaced by Jan van den Berg. Keyboard player Roel Spanjers (of the band Normaal) has often played with the band, as has saxophonist Jan de Ligt. Gumbo is a type of stew from Louisiana. It is the official cuisine of that state, which is also the heartland of zydeco and Cajun music. In 1980, Queen Ida released the album Queen Ida and the Bon Temps Zydeco Band in New Orleans. It includes a song called \\"Capitaine Gumbo\\", co- written by her and her brother Al Lewis (AKA Al Rapone). Captain Gumbo covered the song: it is the second track on their first album, 1 More 2 Step. That suggests a possible origin for the band's name. In 1990, Captain Gumbo released their first CD, 1 More 2 Step. The opening track is their version of the song \\"Allons à Lafayette\\", first recorded in 1928 by Joe Falcon and Cléoma Breaux. It was released as a single, and in 1991 it peaked at No. 30 in the official Dutch music singles chart. On the back of that success, the band toured Louisiana, performing at Breaux Bridge, Baton Rouge and New Orleans, meeting their musical heroes such as D. L. Menard, Eddie LeJeune, Rockin' Dopsie, Marc Savoy, Boozoo Chavis, Chubby Carrier, Walter Mouton and Harry LaFleur, and supporting Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys. Neither 1 More 2 Step nor the band's next album Back à la maison (1992) (whose liner notes included an approving endorsement by record producer Floyd Soileau, who is Cajun) was a commercial success. Their third album, Chank-a-Chank (1994), peaked in the official Dutch album chart at #79. Their more recent releases have been commercially unsuccessful.

Formed in October 1942, the division was soon sent to the front in the Battle of Stalingrad, providing air defense to the 5th Tank Army. After a brief period in Southwestern Front reserve, the division was sent back into combat with the 6th Army in the Third Battle of Kharkov. The division served with the front, which became the 3rd Ukrainian Front, for the entire war. It supported the 8th Guards Army in the Nikopol–Krivoi Rog Offensive in January 1944, and was awarded the honorific Nikopol for its actions. The division was awarded the Order of Kutuzov and the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky for its actions in the war. It was disbanded soon after the end of the war.  World War II  37 mm AA gun of the type used by the division during World War II The 3rd Anti- Aircraft Artillery Division of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK) began forming in late October 1942 in the Moscow Military District under the command of Colonel (promoted to Major General on 9 April 1943) Mikhail Kotikov. The 3rd departed for the Southwestern Front on 2 November, and by 10 November its regiments were providing air defense for rifle divisions of the 5th Tank Army. The division fought in defensive battles and in Operation Uranus, the counteroffensive in the Battle of Stalingrad, and in Operation Little Saturn. In the attack of the Southwestern Front the 3rd provided air defense for the army's shock group, advancing 150 kilometers. Its regiments were credited with downing 50 and damaging 17 enemy aircraft, as well as destroying two tanks and killing up to two companies of infantry. By 1 January, the division included the 1084th, 1089th, 1114th, and the 1118th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments. By 13 February 1943, the division held positions near Bannoye and Bogorodichnoye as part of the front reserve. It transferred to the 6th Army by 20 February to provide air defense for the rail station at Lozova as well as artillery ammunition dumps there during the German counterattack, Third Battle of Kharkov. Kotikov was appointed commander of the defense of Lozova, and between 25 and 28 February the division fought German tanks and infantry before being forced to retreat. In March, the 1114th and 1118th Regiments were directly subordinated to the front. The entire division was directly subordinated to the front in April, and remained thus for most of the rest of the year. On 7 August, Colonel Savely Chapovsky was appointed division commander. As part of the 3rd Ukrainian Front (redesignated from the Southwestern Front on 20 October), the division covered the 8th Guards Army from December in its attack towards Krivoy Rog and in the subsequent Nikopol–Krivoi Rog Offensive. In January, the division was again directly subordinated to the front, remaining there for the rest of the war. For helping to capture Nikopol on 8 February, the division received the city's name as an honorific. In the spring of 1944, the division fought in the raid into the German rear in Bessarabia. Chapovsky was replaced by deputy division commander Colonel Vasily Gladkov on 31 July before dying of complications from peritonitis on 6 August. The 3rd fought in the elimination of the Axis pocket during the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive in the summer. On 7 September it was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class for \\"exemplary fulfillment of command tasks\\" in breaking through enemy defenses south of Bender and the capture of Kishinev and its \\"valor and courage\\". It then advanced into Bulgaria and fought in the Belgrade Offensive. In late 1944 the division moved north into Hungary in the Budapest Offensive, crossing the Danube in the area of Pápa and Dunaföldvár. The 3rd was credited with downing 25 enemy aircraft, destroying 14 pillboxes and 200 vehicles, and killing 4,190 enemy soldiers in 1944. In the spring of 1945, the division provided air defense for the 18th Tank Corps and the 4th Guards Army during the Balaton Defensive Operation, the repulse of Operation Spring Awakening, a German counterattack. It ended the war in the Vienna Offensive, advancing into Austria. During the war, the division was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, and the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd class, for its actions.

It provides early-stage venture capital to entrepreneurs across multiple disciplines. Since its founding, it has invested in 23andMe, Halo Neuro, Kensho, Landit, Ravel Law, Rest Devices, and Zumper, among others. Xfund was founded as the Experiment Fund in 2012 as a partnership between the venture capital companies New Enterprise Associates, Accel Partners, Breyer Capital, and Polaris Partners. Anchored at Harvard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), it was established to make seed-stage investments in startups developed at Harvard and MIT. In 2014 its investment portfolio was acquired by Xfund, a $100m successor fund co-founded by Hugo Van Vuuren and Patrick S. Chung. History =Experiment Fund= The Experiment Fund was launched in January 2012 as a $10 million seed fund and incubator designed specifically to support student start-ups and develop technologies and platforms created in Cambridge. Its advisors included Harvard faculty members Edwards, Murray, Harry Lewis, Doug Melton, and John Palfrey, in addition to MIT researcher Hugo Liu, Facebook co- founder Andrew McCollum, Breyer Capital's Jim Breyer and NEA's Harry Weller and Chung. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, Harvard had no financial stake in the Experiment Fund. Run with Van Vuuren as the \\"on the ground\\" full- time partner in Cambridge, approximately 50% of the deal-flow in the original fund came from companies launched by Harvard students, faculty and staff. 25% came from MIT-affiliated entrepreneurs and 9% from Stanford. Experiment Fund identified more than 3500 investment opportunities in the community in the first two years of its existence. It evaluated 900 companies and invested in five. The average markup of the portfolio from seed valuation to valuation in May 2014 was over 10x. =Xfund= In December 2014, Van Vuuren and Chung raised $100 million in capital commitments for a second fund, and founded Xfund. Experiment Fund investments were rolled into the Xfund portfolio, and the company was renamed Xfund. Xfund's limited partners included Top Tier Capital, Goldman Sachs, Saudi Aramco, Jasper Ridge and Breyer Capital. =Lawsuit= In January 2016, Van Vuuren reached out to Xfund's Limited Partners Advisory Committee (LPAC) accusing Chung of mismanagement in response to the firing of an employee. Separately, Chung had also reached out to the LPAC requesting intervention and raising questions about Van Vuuren's stability. In March 2016, the LPAC voted to fire Van Vuuren and put Chung in charge. In May 2016, Van Vuuren filed a civil lawsuit against Chung, alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, defamation, and a violation of California's two-party consent law. The case was settled in February 2017. Brandon Farwell, previously of Rothenberg Ventures, subsequently joined Xfund as a partner.

Campbell states that \\"it was considered impossible that these wounds could have been inflicted by human agency.\\" He further mentions that the attacks ceased after the victim's body was found, which led the folklorist Katharine Briggs to suggest that the monster may have been the ghost of a murdered man looking for revenge.Briggs, Katharine (1976).

Conspiracism is an important phenomenon in understanding Turkish politics. This is explained by a desire to \\"make up for our lost Ottoman grandeur\\", the humiliation of perceiving Turkey as part of \\"the malfunctioning half\\" of the world, and a low level of media literacy among the Turkish population. The prevalence of conspiracy theorizing in Turkey =Roots and causes= Prominent Turkish author and journalist Mustafa Akyol describes the reason for the prevalence of conspiracy theorizing in Turkey as \\"it makes us feel important. If the world is conspiring against us, we must be really special. It is, I believe, the way we Turks make up for our lost Ottoman grandeur.\\" Turkish economist Selim Koru has pointed to the humiliation of perceiving Turkey as part of the \\"malfunctioning [half]\\" of the world. Turkish consumers are the second-most media illiterate when compared to countries in Europe, leaving them especially vulnerable to fake news, a 2018 report released by the Open Society Institute said. A combination of low education levels, low reading scores, low media freedom and low societal trust went into making the score, which saw Turkey being placed above only North Macedonia. According to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2018, Turkey with some distance is the country with most made-up news reports in the world. =Distinct features= A distinct feature of conspiracy theorizing in Turkey is that at the alleged command and control end of an alleged conspiracy scheme there are usually narrated to be state governments; this is due to an extreme state- centric worldview taught in the Turkish education system. Doğan Gürpınar; a scholar whose areas of study include nationalism, historiography, and ideologies in Turkey; argues that conspiracism's power to shape intellectual discourse and ideological standpoints as well as represent the state tradition is unique to Turkey. Conspiracy theorizing since before the AKP era Before the AKP era, conspiracy theorizing in Turkey was generally directed against \\"the West\\", but also focused on Armenian Genocide denial. =Conspiracy theory that the Armenian genocide is invented= Turkish Armenian Genocide denialists typically argue the academic consensus of it being a genocide as anti-Turkish propaganda or as a conspiracy spread by the Armenians, instead claiming that it either did not occur or that it was somehow justified at the time. Conspiracy theorizing during the AKP era Since the AKP came to power in 2002, conspiracy theories have gradually grown to dominate public discourse in Turkey. Mustafa Akyol summarizes the situation as follows: \\"Under Erdogan’s leadership, Turkey began to rise as a global power after a century of frailty. Since this New Turkey represents global justice for all the downtrodden, all the dark masters of the world are now alarmed by its glorious march. That is why they are using all their pawns against Turkey to defame, weaken, or destabilize it.\\" =The general \\"Mastermind\\" conspiracy theory narrative= In 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan coined the term \\"mastermind\\" () to denote the alleged command and control institution, somewhat ambiguously placed with the government of the United States, in a comprehensive conspiracy to weaken or even dismember Turkey, by orchestrating every political actor and action perceived hostile by Turkey. Erdoğan as well as the Daily Sabah have often alleged that very different non-state actors — like the Salafi jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Islamist cult with political ambitions around Fethullah Gülen — were attacking Turkey at the same time in a well-coordinated campaign. A notable instance of promoting the \\"Mastermind\\" conspiracy theory was in February 2017 then Ankara Mayor Melih Gökçek claiming that an earthquake in Çanakkale had been artificially generated by foreign powers. Similar claims have been made before, such as that the earthquakes of İzmit and Van were \\"generated\\" by the USA through the HAARP. In another example in November 2017, the Islamist newspaper Yeni Akit claimed that the fashion trend of \\"ripped denim\\" jeans would in fact be a means of communication, via specific forms of rips and holes, between agents of foreign states and their collaborators in Turkey. Throughout 2017, the Turkish AKP government increasingly started to explicitly name the United States as the alleged \\"mastermind\\". According to a poll from April 2018, 42 percent of Turks, and 59 percent of AKP voters, saw the decline in the lira as a plot by foreign powers. On 30 May, foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu claimed that the plunge of the lira would have been caused by an organized campaign masterminded abroad, adding that the conspiracy would include both \\"the interest rate lobby\\" and \\"some Muslim countries\\", which he however refused to name. In August 2018, Erdoğan started using the formula of \\"the world fighting an economic war against Turkey\\". Journalist Ömer Turan asserted that Netflix Turkey's teaser trailer for Money Heist contained messages aiming to incite the \\"second wave\\" of the Gezi Park protests. Similar remarks were made by Melih Gökçek later on. =Conspiracy theories directed against Israel= In the course of the 2006 Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Turkey, Felicity Party member Abdullah Uzun claimed that the tick species that spread the disease was brought to Turkey by Israeli female tourists. In May 2012, a dead European bee-eater with an Israeli leg-band, used by naturalists to track migratory birds, was found by villagers near the southeastern Turkish city of Gaziantep. The villagers worried that the bird may have carried a micro-chip from Israeli intelligence to spy on the area and alerted local officials. The head of the Agriculture and Livestock Provincial Directorate in Gaziantep, Akif Aslanpay, examined the corpse of the bee-eater and stated that he found that \\"the nose of the bird is very different and much lighter than others\\" and that it \\"can be used for audio and video,\\" which, \\"in the case of Israel, they do.\\" A counter-terrorism unit became involved before Turkey's agriculture ministry assured villagers that it is common to equip migratory birds with rings in order to track their movements. The BBC correspondent, Jonathan Head, ascribed the event to his view that \\"wildly implausible conspiracy theories take root easily in Turkey, with alleged Israeli plots among the most widely believed.\\" In 2013, a kestrel carrying an Israeli foot band was discovered by villagers in the Elazığ Province, Turkey. Initially, medical personnel at Firat University identified the bird as \\"Israeli Spy\\" in their registration documents. After thorough medical examinations, including X-ray scans, the bird was determined to be carrying no electronic equipment. No charges were filed and the kestrel was freed and allowed to continue its flight. In 2018, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım called Israel's Eurovision victory an \\"imperialist plot devised to ensure that Jerusalem becomes the following year's host and to provoke interreligious conflict.\\" A frequent claim that sees the Coca-Cola Company as an Israeli company or a company that gives financial aid to Israel led to its products being boycotted by some. =The \\"War against Islam\\" conspiracy theory narrative= \\"War against Islam\\", also called the \\"War on Islam\\" or \\"Attack on Islam\\", is a conspiracy theory narrative in Islamist discourse to describe an alleged conspiracy to harm, weaken or annihilate the societal system of Islam, using military, economic, social and cultural means. The perpetrators of the conspiracy are alleged to be non-Muslims, particularly the Western world and \\"false Muslims\\", allegedly in collusion with political actors in the Western world. While the contemporary conspiracy theory narrative of the \\"War against Islam\\" mostly covers general issues of societal transformations in modernization and secularization as well as general issues of international power politics among modern states, the Crusades are often narrated as its alleged starting point. The English-language political neologism of \\"War on Islam\\" was coined in Islamist discourse in the 1990s and popularized as a conspiracy theory only after 2001. =The secret articles of the Treaty of Lausanne= It has been claimed in civil and formal circles that the Treaty of Lausanne will expire in 2023. According to the conspiracy theory, Turkey is forbidden to mine its natural resources (such as boron and petroleum) due to the \\"secret articles\\" of the treaty; therefore, Turkey will rapidly become a developed country by mining and exporting its resources once the treaty expires.

The Cabaret du Ciel was an early version of modern theme restaurants, with a theme centered around celestial concepts connected to the afterlife in Paradise. The cabaret was located next to the Cabaret de L'Enfer (Cabaret of Hell) at the same address at 53 Boulevard de Clichy. The Cabaret du Ciel, along with the Cabaret de L'Enfer (Cabaret of Hell), and the Cabaret du Néant (Cabaret of Nothingness), was part of a trio of themed restaurants established at around the same time in Montmartre in the 1890s. The Cabaret du Ciel and the Cabaret de L'Enfer took advantage of their proximity and enhanced it further by taking radically different approaches on their exterior design, which led prospective patrons to want to visit both during an outing.  Theme  Cabaret du Ciel interior Cabaret du Ciel promo photo Because the Cabaret du Ciel and the Cabaret de L'Enfer were next door to each other, customers could visit both and get an idea of these two very different concepts of entertainment. The two operations took advantage of their proximity and enhanced it further by taking radically different approaches on their exterior design. The storefront of the Ciel was painted in white and blue, and was decorated by angels, while Hell's façade was painted in red and black and its entrance featured giant satanic jaws. The cabaret followed the trend of similar establishments of the era which focused their entertainment on death and the afterlife. The atmosphere inside the cabaret was provided by harp music, a master of ceremonies playing the role of a priest, and a selection of plays centered around themes involving the depiction of the joys of the heavenly afterlife. Inside the restaurant, beer was served, and the customers were greeted by acts such as angels playing music, St. Peter sprinkling holy water from the heavens, as well as reenactments of scenes related to Dante's Inferno. In one part of the hall, there was a giant golden pig, surrounded by candles. The patrons formed a line, as they approached the statue of the animal, bowing and making the sign of the cross before it. Trevor Greenwood, a British serviceman stationed in Paris in 1945, provides a detailed description of a visit he made to the Cabaret du Ciel in its final years. \\"And when I got through that tiny door… well… I just couldn’t believe my own eyes. We found ourselves in a room about the size of our front room and dining room combined… but what a room! Down the centre, lengthwise, was a long table covered with a white cloth… and lots of ash-trays: around the long table were seats, some already occupied by bewildered looking Yanks: I suppose there would be about thirty seats all told. At the far end of the room was a small screen about eight feet square… presumably hiding a stage of some sort… And the room itself!! It might have been a temple for the sinister performances of black magic or something. The walls were covered with cheap imitations of religious knick-knacks. At one side, there was a ‘bulge’ which seemed to represent a pulpit: at one side of the screen was a full sized model of a pig sitting on its haunches and poking its snout at us. At the opposite end was a large bell suspended from an imitation beam… and it was a wooden bell! Close to the bell was a banner-pole, with a silver coloured effigy of a bull mounted on top… The whole place reeked of something sinister… and the general effect was the very essence of tawdriness.\\" Illustrations by W.

He was the booker and trainer for his brother, World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion Joe Stecher, and later was America's top wrestling promoter. In 1948, Stecher was one of five promoters to back Paul \\"Pinkie\\" George in the formation of the National Wrestling Alliance. In boxing, he was a prominent promoter in the sport, particularly from 1944-1954, and is credited with reviving boxing in Minnesota during the 1940s. He is a member of the Minnesota Boxing Hall of Fame (Class of 2013) and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 1996) Early life Anton Stecher was born on born on February 7, 1889 on a farm just outside Dodge, Nebraska. \\"Tony\\" had a substandard education and worked as a farmhand from a young age. His younger brother Joe was born on April 4, 1893. In January 1912, Tony and Joe visited nearby Fremont, Nebraska to see famed wrestler Ben Roller. As he often did, Roller challenged all comers on the mat and both Tony and Joe took him up on the challenge. Roller tossed both but was impressed by Joe's natural talent. Following a disagreement with their father about them becoming professional wrestlers instead of farmers, Joe and Tony ran away from home, hitchhiking to Fremont where they joined the local YMCA and began honing their skills in wrestling In-ring wrestling career Tony would soon turn pro in wrestling and competed throughout the Central States against wrestlers such as Frank Coleman and John Solomon. In 1914, he was wrestling as the Middleweight Champion of Nebraska and on October 15 of the same year he defeated Tom Doctor in Dodge to also become Kansas State Middleweight Champion. On April 22 of 1914, he competed in a 5 hour, 18 minute bout against Wesley Cobb in Stuart, Nebraska. Booking for Joe Stecher Tony went on to have memorable rivalries with the likes of Clarence Eklund but his work as promoter and booker for his brother Joe (whom he also trained) soon became his main focus. The undefeated Joe achieved unparalleled success but battled demons throughout his career and needed Tony to protect him against unscrupulous promoters. With his matches managed by Tony, Joe became one of wrestling's biggest stars. As brothers they were very close and travelled throughout the United States together, with Tony brokering scores of bouts from 1917 to 1934. After capturing numerous World Heavyweight Championships, at 43 years of age and after some business setbacks, Joe was hospitalised after suffered a breakdown. Tony arranged for him to be moved to a hospital St. Cloud, Minnesota where he attended to his brother until his own passing. Promoter and booker Independently wealthy from his decades in the wrestling business, Tony began a wrestling office as a promoter in Minneapolis. He was taken by the city after a trip in the early 1930s and relocated his family from Nebraska to Minnesota in 1933. His first program was on February 21, 1933, with the wrestling debut of football star Bronko Nagurski. Stecher achieved great success and became the nation's top wrestling promoter. He formed business relationships with various promoters in neighbouring states and aided an upstart Sam Muchnick in created his territory in St. Louis, sending him wrestlers to help the outfit grow. Stecher's career in the boxing business continued alongside his wrestling tenure. He was the exclusive promoter recognised by the Minnesota Boxing Commission and was a prominent figure in the sport from 1944-1954. He put on scores of bouts with boxing stars such as Jackie Graves, Rocky Graziano, Willie Pep, Beau Jack and Sandy Saddler. He joined Maxwell Clayton and Pinkie George to form an innovative working arrangement to bring top-level boxing fights to the American Heartland. Other promoters joined the successful collaboration, and soon thereafter a similar professional wrestling agreement was made. Pinkie George organised a symposium in Waterloo, Iowa with regional promoters, including Stecher, at which the National Wrestling Alliance was formulated. Later life and career Stecher continued to play a pivotal role in the ongoing success of the National Wrestling Alliance and professional wrestling in his territory. He was thought of as a generous and fair man by wrestlers and his \\"kindness was renowned\\". In boxing, Stecher is credited with reviving boxing in Minnesota and set records for both attendance and gates for boxing Death Stecher died of a heart attack on October 10, 1954, having felt unwell the night before. His death was national news and his funeral was attended by sports figures such as Joe Louis and Jack Dempsey.
