Fig. 1 Anatolia, western Caucasus and northern Levant under Trajan Trajan's Parthian campaign, also known as Trajan's Parthian War, was engaged by Roman emperor Trajan in the year 115 against the Parthian Empire in Mesopotamia. The war was initially successful for the Romans, but due to a series of setbacks, including wide-scale rebellions in the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa, as well as Trajan's death in 117, ended in a Roman withdrawal. In 113, Trajan decided that the moment was ripe to resolve the \\"eastern question\\" once and for all time by the decisive defeat of Parthia and the annexation of Armenia; his conquests marked a deliberate change of Roman policy towards Parthia, and a shift of emphasis in the \\"grand strategy\\" of the empire.Lightfoot (1990), 115: \\"Trajan succeeded in acquiring territory in these lands with a view to annexation, something which had not seriously been attempted before [...] Although Hadrian abandoned all of Trajan's conquests [...] the trend was not to be reversed. Further wars of annexation followed under Lucius Verus and Septimius Severus.\\"; Sicker (2000), 167‚Äì168 In 114, Trajan invaded Armenia, annexed it as a Roman province, and killed Parthamasiris who was placed on the Armenian throne by his relative, the king of Parthia, Osroes I.Sicker (2000), 167 In 115, the Roman emperor overran northern Mesopotamia and annexed it to Rome as well; its conquest was deemed necessary, since otherwise the Armenian salient could be cut off by the Parthians from the south. The Romans then captured the Parthian capital, Ctesiphon, before sailing downriver to the Persian Gulf. However, in that year revolts erupted in the Eastern Mediterranean, North Africa and northern Mesopotamia, while a major Jewish revolt broke out in Roman territory, severely stretching Roman military resources. Trajan failed to take Hatra, which avoided total Parthian defeat. Parthian forces attacked key Roman positions, while Roman garrisons at Seleucia, Nisibis and Edessa were evicted by the local populaces. Trajan subdued the rebels in Mesopotamia, installed the Parthian prince Parthamaspates as a client ruler, and withdrew to Syria. Trajan died in 117, before he could renew the war.Sicker (2000), 167‚Äì168 Trajan's Parthian campaign is considered, in different ways, the climax of \\"two centuries of political posturing and bitter rivalry.\\" Trajan was the first emperor to carry out a successful invasion of Mesopotamia. His grand scheme for Armenia and Mesopotamia were ultimately \\"cut short by circumstances created by an incorrect understanding of the strategic realities of eastern conquest and an underestimation of what insurgency can do.\\" Background In 113, Trajan embarked on his last campaign, provoked by Parthia's decision to put an unacceptable king on the throne of Armenia, a kingdom over which the two great empires had shared hegemony since the time of Nero, some fifty years earlier. Many modern historians consider that Trajan's decision to wage war against Parthia might have had economic motives: after Trajan's annexation of Arabia, he built a new road, Via Traiana Nova, that went from Bostra to Aila on the Red Sea. That meant that Charax on the Persian Gulf was the sole remaining western terminus of the Indian trade route outside direct Roman control,Christol & Nony, Rome, 171 and such control was important in order to lower import prices and to limit the supposed drain of precious metals created by the deficit in Roman trade with the Far East. That Charax traded with the Roman Empire, there can be no doubt, as its actual connections with merchants from Palmyra during the period are well documented in a contemporary Palmyrene epigraph, which tells of various Palmyrene citizens honoured for holding office in Charax.Daniel T. Potts, ed., Araby the Blest: Studies in Arabian Archaeology. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1988, , page 142 Also, Charax's rulers' domains at the time possibly included the Bahrain islands (where a Palmyrene citizen held office, shortly after Trajan's death, as satrapbut then, the appointment was made by a Parthian king of CharaxJulian Reade, ed.,The Indian Ocean In Antiquity. London: Routledge, 2013, , page 279) something which offered the possibility of extending Roman hegemony into the Persian Gulf itself.Potts, 143 The rationale behind Trajan's campaign, in this case, would be one of breaking down a system of Far Eastern trade through small Semitic (\\"Arab\\") cities under Parthia's control and to put it under Roman control instead.George Fadlo Hourani, Arab Seafaring in the Indian Ocean in Ancient and Early Medieval Times. Princeton University Press, 1995, , page 15 In his Dacian conquests, Trajan had already resorted to Syrian auxiliary units, whose veterans, along with Syrian traders, had an important role in the subsequent colonization of Dacia. He had recruited Palmyrene units into his army, including a camel unit,Pat Southern, Empress Zenobia: Palmyra's Rebel Queen. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2008, , page 25 therefore apparently procuring Palmyrene support to his ultimate goal of annexing Charax. It has even been ventured that, when earlier in his campaign Trajan annexed Armenia, he was bound to annex the whole of Mesopotamia lest the Parthians interrupt the flux of trade from the Persian Gulf and/or foment trouble at the Roman frontier on the Danube.Freya Stark, Rome on the Euphrates: The Story of a Frontier.London: I.B. Tauris, 2012, , page 211 Other historians reject these motives, as the supposed Parthian \\"control\\" over the maritime Far Eastern trade route was, at best, conjectural and based on a selective reading of Chinese sourcestrade by land through Parthia seems to have been unhampered by Parthian authorities and left solely to the devices of private enterprise. Commercial activity in second century Mesopotamia seems to have been a general phenomenon, shared by many peoples within and without the Roman Empire, with no sign of a concerted Imperial policy towards it. As in the case of the alimenta, scholars like Moses Finley and Paul Veyne have considered the whole idea of a foreign trade \\"policy\\" behind Trajan's war anachronistic: according to them, the sole Roman concern with the Far Eastern luxuries tradebesides collecting toll taxes and customsPaul Erdkamp, The Grain Market in the Roman Empire: A Social, Political and Economic Study. Cambridge University Press, 2005, , page 5was moral and involved frowning upon the \\"softness\\" of luxuries, but no economic policy. In the absence of conclusive evidence, trade between Rome and India might have been far more balanced, in terms of quantities of precious metals exchanged: one of our sources for the notion of the Roman gold drainPliny's the Younger's uncle Pliny the Elderhad earlier described the Gangetic Plains as one of the gold sources for the Roman Empire. In his controversial book on the Ancient economy, Finley considers Trajan's \\"badly miscalculated and expensive assault on Parthia\\" to be an example of the many Roman \\"commercial wars\\" that had in common the fact of existing only in the books of modern historians. The alternative view is to see the campaign as triggered by the lure of territorial annexation and prestige, the sole motive ascribed by Cassius Dio. As far as territorial conquest involved tax- collecting,Michael Alexander Speidel: \\"Bellicosissimus Princeps\\". In: Annette N√ºnnerich-Asmus ed., Traian. Ein Kaiser der Superlative am Beginn einer Umbruchzeit? Mainz 2002, pages 23/40. especially of the 25% tax levied on all goods entering the Roman Empire, the tetarte, one can say that Trajan's Parthian War had an \\"economic\\" motive. Also, there was the propaganda value of an Eastern conquest that would emulate, in Roman fashion, those of Alexander the Great.Nathanael John Andrade, \\"Imitation Greeks\\": Being Syrian in the Greco-Roman World (175 BCE ‚Äì 275 CE). Doctoral Thesis, University of Michigan, 2009, page 192. Available at . Retrieved June 11, 2014 The fact that emissaries from the Kushan Empire might have attended to the commemorative ceremonies for the Dacian War may have kindled in some Greco-Roman intellectuals like Plutarchwho wrote about only 70,000 Roman soldiers being necessary to a conquest of Indiaas well as in Trajan's closer associates, speculative dreams about the booty to be obtained by reproducing Macedonian Eastern conquests.Raoul McLaughlin, Rome and the Distant East: Trade Routes to the Ancient Lands of Arabia, India and China. London: Continuum, 2010, , page 130 Also, it is possible that the attachment of Trajan to an expansionist policy was supported by a powerful circle of conservative senators from Hispania committed to a policy of imperial expansion, first among them being the all-powerful Licinius Sura. One can explain the campaign by the fact that, for the Romans, their empire was in principle unlimited, and that Trajan only took advantage of an opportunity to make idea and reality coincide.Dexter Hoyos, ed., A Companion to Roman Imperialism. Leiden: Brill, 2012, , page 262 Finally, there are other modern historians who think that Trajan's original aims were purely military and quite modest: to assure a more defensible Eastern frontier for the Roman Empire, crossing Northern Mesopotamia along the course of the Khabur River in order to offer cover to a Roman Armenia. This interpretation is backed by the fact that all subsequent Roman wars against Parthia would aim at establishing a Roman presence deep into Parthia itself.David Kennedy & Derrick Riley, Rome's Desert Frontiers . London: B.T. Datsford Limited, 2004, , pages 31/32 Timeline=Planning the campaign The campaign was carefully planned in advance: ten legions were concentrated in the Eastern theater; since 111, the correspondence of Pliny the Younger witnesses to the fact that provincial authorities in Bithynia had to organize supplies for passing troops, and local city councils and their individual members had to shoulder part of the increased expenses by supplying troops themselves.Fergus Millar, The Roman Near East, 31 B.C. ‚Äì A.D. 337. Harvard University Press, 1993, , page 103 The intended campaign, therefore, was immensely costly from its very beginning.M.Christol & D. Nony, Rome et son Empire. Paris: Hachette, 2003, , page 171 Armenia Trajan marched first on Armenia, deposed the Parthian-appointed king (who was afterwards murdered while kept in the custody of Roman troops in an unclear incident, later described by Fronto as a breach of Roman good faithJohn Rich,Graham Shipley, eds., War and Society in the Roman World. London: Routledge, 1993, , page 235) and annexed it to the Roman Empire as a province, receiving in passing the acknowledgement of Roman hegemony by various tribes in the Caucasus and on the Eastern coast of the Black Seaa process that kept him busy until the end of 114.

It is possible that Quietus' campaign had as its goal the extending of the newer, more defensible Roman border eastwards towards the Caspian Sea and northwards to the foothills of the Caucasus.S.J. De Laet, review of Lepper, Trajan's Parthian War. L'Antiquit√© Classique, 18-2, 1949, pages 487‚Äì489 Mesopotamia The chronology of subsequent events is uncertain, but it is generally believed that early in 115 Trajan launched a Mesopotamian campaign, marching down towards the Taurus mountains in order to consolidate territory between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. He placed permanent garrisons along the way to secure the territory. While Trajan moved from west to east, Lusius Quietus moved with his army from the Caspian Sea towards the west, both armies performing a successful pincer movement, whose apparent result was to establish a Roman presence into the Parthian Empire proper, with Trajan taking the northern Mesopotamian cities of Nisibis and Batnae and organizing a province of Mesopotamia, including the Kingdom of Osrhoenewhere King AbgarosVII submitted to Trajan publiclyMaurice Sartre,The Middle East Under Rome.

According to Cassius Dio, the deal between Trajan and Abgaros was sealed by the king's son offering himself as Trajan's paramour‚ÄîBennett, 199as a Roman protectorate. This process seems to have been completed at the beginning of 116, when coins were issued announcing that Armenia and Mesopotamia had been put under the authority of the Roman people.Bennett, Trajan, 196; Christol & Nony, Rome,171 The area between the Khabur River and the mountains around Singara seems to have been considered as the new frontier, and as such received a road surrounded by fortresses.

Harvard University Press, 1993, , p. 101Trajan again took to the field in 116, with a view to the conquest the whole of Mesopotamia, an overambitious goal that eventually backfired on the results of his entire campaign. According to some modern historians, the aim of the campaign of 116 was to achieve a \\"preemptive demonstration\\" aiming not toward the conquest of Parthia, but for tighter Roman control over the Eastern trade route. However, the overall scarcity of manpower for the Roman military establishment meant that the campaign was doomed from the start.Patrick Le Roux, IN S√©gol√®ne Demougin, ed., H.-G. Pflaum, un historien du XXe si√®cle: actes du colloque international, Paris les 21, 22 et 23 octobre 2004. Geneva: Droz, 2006, , pages 182/183 It is noteworthy that no new legions were raised by Trajan before the Parthian campaign, maybe because the sources of new citizen recruits were already over- exploited. As far as the sources allow a description of this campaign, it seems that one Roman division crossed the Tigris into Adiabene, sweeping south and capturing Adenystrae; a second followed the river south, capturing Babylon; Trajan himself sailed down the Euphrates from Dura-Europoswhere a triumphal arch was erected in his honourthrough Ozogardana, where he erected a \\"tribunal\\" still to be seen at the time of Julian the Apostate's campaigns in the same area. Having come to the narrow strip of land between the Euphrates and the Tigris, he then dragged his fleet overland into the Tigris, capturing Seleucia and finally the Parthian capital of Ctesiphon. He continued southward to the Persian Gulf, when, after his fleet escaped a tidal bore on the Tigris,Longden, \\"Notes on the Parthian Campaigns\\", 8 he received the submission of Athambelus, the ruler of Charax. He declared Babylon a new province of the Empire and had his statue erected on the shore of the Persian Gulf,T. Olajos, \\"Le monument du triomphe de Trajan en Parthie. Quelques renseignements inobserv√©s (Jean d'Eph√®se, Anthologie Grecque XVI 72)\\". Acta Antiqua Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, 1981, vol. 29, no1-4, pp. 379‚Äì383. The statue was torn down by Sassanids in 571/572 after which he sent the Senate a laurelled letter declaring the war to be at a close and bemoaning that he was too old to go on any further and repeat the conquests of Alexander the Great. Since Charax was a de facto independent kingdom whose connections to Palmyra were described above, Trajan's bid for the Persian Gulf may have coincided with Palmyrene interests in the region. Another hypothesis is that the rulers of Charax had expansionist designs on Parthian Babylon, giving them a rationale for alliance with Trajan.E. J. Keall, \\"Parthian Nippur and Vologases' Southern Strategy: A Hypothesis\\". Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 95, No. 4 (Oct. ‚Äì Dec. 1975), pp. 620‚Äì632 The Parthian summer capital of Susa was apparently also occupied by the Romans.George Rawlinson, Parthia. New York: Cosimo, 2007, , page 310 According to late literary sources (not backed by numismatic or inscriptional evidence) a province of Assyria was also proclaimed,Christopher S. Mackay, Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History.Cambridge University Press, 2004, , p. 227 apparently covering the territory of Adiabene.Various authors have discussed the existence of the province and its location: Andr√© Maricq (La province d'Assyrie cr√©√©e par Trajan. A propos de la guerre parthique de Trajan. In: Maricq: Classica et orientalia, Paris 1965, pages 103/111) identifies Assyria with Southern Mesopotamia; Chris S. Lightfood (\\"Trajan's Parthian War and the Fourth-Century Perspective\\", Journal of Roman Studies 80 (1990), pp. 115‚Äì126), doubts the actual existence of the province; Maria G. Angeli Bertinelli (\\"I Romani oltre l'Eufrate nel II secolo d. C. - le provincie di Assiria, di Mesopotamia e di Osroene\\", In Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt, Bd. 9.1, Berlin 1976, pp. 3-45) puts Assyria between Mesopotamia and Adiabene; Lepper (1948, page 146) considers Assyria and Adiabene to be the same province. Some measures seem to have been considered regarding the fiscal administration of Indian tradeor simply about the payment of customs (portoria) on goods traded on the Euphrates and Tigris. It is possible that it was this \\"streamlining\\" of the administration of the newly conquered lands according to the standard pattern of Roman provincial administration in tax collecting, requisitions and the handling of local potentates' prerogatives, that triggered later resistance against Trajan.Janos Harmatta and others, eds., History of Civilizations of Central Asia: The development of sedentary and nomadic civilizations, 700 B.C. to A.D. 250. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1999, , p. 135 According to some modern historians, Trajan might have busied himself during his stay on the Persian Gulf with ordering raids on the Parthian coasts,Pirouz Mojtahed- Zadeh, Security and Territoriality in the Persian Gulf: A Maritime Political Geography,London: Routledge, 2013, , page 120 as well as probing into extending Roman suzerainty over the mountaineer tribes holding the passes across the Zagros Mountains into the Iranian Plateau eastward, as well as establishing some sort of direct contact between Rome and the Kushan Empire. No attempt was made to expand into the Iranian Plateau itself, where the Roman army, with its relative weakness in cavalry, would have been at a disadvantage.Axel Kristinsson, Expansions: Competition and Conquest in Europe Since the Bronze Age. Reykjav√≠k: Reykjav√≠kurAkadem√≠an, 2010, , p. 129 A coin of Trajan, found together with coins of the Kushan ruler Kanishka, at the Ahin Posh Buddhist Monastery, Afghanistan However, as Trajan left the Persian Gulf for Babylonwhere he intended to offer sacrifice to Alexander in the house where he had died in 323BCBennett, Trajan, 199a sudden outburst of Parthian resistance, led by a nephew of the Parthian king, Sanatruces, who had retained a cavalry force, possibly strengthened by the addition of Saka archers,Kaveh Farrokh, Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War. Oxford: Osprey, 2007, , p. 162 imperilled Roman positions in Mesopotamia and Armenia, something Trajan sought to deal with by forsaking direct Roman rule in Parthia proper, at least partially. Trajan sent two armies towards Northern Mesopotamia: the first, under Lusius Quietus, recovered Nisibis and Edessa from the rebels, probably having King Abgarus deposed and killed in the process, while a second, under Appius Maximus Santra (probably a governor of Macedonia), was defeated, with Santra being killed.Juli√°n Gonz√°lez, ed., Trajano Emperador De Roma, p. 216 Later in 116, Trajan, with the assistance of Quietus and two other legates, Marcus Erucius Clarus and Tiberius Julius Alexander Julianus,The last two were made consuls (suffecti) for the year 117 defeated a Parthian army in a battle where Sanatruces was killed. After re-taking and burning Seleucia, Trajan then formally deposed the Parthian king Osroes I and put his own puppet ruler Parthamaspates on the throne. This event was commemorated in a coin so as to be presented as the reduction of Parthia to client kingdom status: REX PARTHIS DATUS, \\"a king is given to the Parthians\\". That done, Trajan retreated north in order to retain what he could of the new provinces of Armeniawhere he had already accepted an armistice in exchange for surrendering part of the territory to Sanatruces' son Vologeses and Mesopotamia. Bust of Trajan, Glyptothek, Munich It was at this point that Trajan's health started to fail him. The fortress city of Hatra, on the Tigris in his rear, continued to hold out against repeated Roman assaults. He was personally present at the siege, and it is possible that he suffered a heat stroke while in the blazing heat. Jewish uprising Shortly afterwards, the Jews inside the Eastern Roman Empire, in Egypt, Cyprus and Cyrenethis last province being probably the original trouble hotspotrose up in what probably was an outburst of religious rebellion against the local pagans, this widespread rebellion being afterwards named the Kitos War.James J. Bloom, The Jewish Revolts Against Rome, A.D. 66‚Äì135: A Military Analysis. McFarland, 2010, p. 191 Another rebellion flared up among the Jewish communities of Northern Mesopotamia, probably part of a general reaction against Roman occupation.Bloom, p. 194 Trajan was forced to withdraw his army in order to put down the revolts. He saw this withdrawal as simply a temporary setback, but he was destined never to command an army in the field again, turning his Eastern armies over to Lusius Quietus, who meanwhile had been made governor of Judaea and might have had to deal earlier with some kind of Jewish unrest in the province.A precise description of events in Judaea at the time being impossible, due to the non-historical character of the Jewish (rabbinic) sources, and the silence of the non-Jewish ones: William David Davies,Louis Finkelstein,Steven T.

Berlim: Dunker & Hunblot, 1994, , p 448 It has been theorized that Quietus and his colleagues were executed on Hadrian's direct orders, for fear of their popular standing with the army and their close connections to Trajan.Histoire des Juifs, Troisi√®me p√©riode, I ‚Äì Chapitre III ‚Äì Soul√®vement des Jud√©ens sous Trajan et Adrien In contrast, the next prominent Roman figure in charge of the repression of the Jewish revolt, the equestrian Marcius Turbo, who had dealt with the rebel leader from Cyrene, Loukuas,Bloom, pp. 195, 196 retained Hadrian's trust, eventually becoming his Praetorian Prefect. Apparently, Hadrian could not allow the continued existence alongside him of a group of independent-minded senatorial generals inherited from his predecessor.Hoyos, A Companion to Roman Imperialism, p. 325 As all four consulars were senators of the highest standing and as such generally regarded as able to take imperial power (capaces imperii), Hadrian seems to have decided on a preemptive strike against these prospective rivals.Gabriele Marasco, ed., Political Autobiographies and Memoirs in Antiquity: A Brill Companion.

Harris announced he would run for Delegate to the United States House of Representatives as the Socialist Workers Party candidate. Raised in the District, Harris attended Cleveland State University. At the time of his candidacy, he was a resident of Glover Park and worked as an auto mechanic. He protested the Vietnam War as a member of the Student Mobilization Committee, and he was also a member of the Young Socialist Alliance. In Summer 1970, Harris traveled to Cuba to harvest sugar cane as part of the Venceremos Brigade. Harris' campaign focused on establishing a minimum annual wage, reducing the workweek, prices limits established by trade unions and consumer groups, a 100 percent tax on income in excess of $25,000, and ending the Vietnam War. Harris stressed that communities that whose residents are predominantly Black should be controlled by Black people and that the economy must be democratically planned so that all people benefit not just the wealthy. Harris advocated for preferential hiring of women, free daycare, and free contraception and abortions. Rep. Richard Ichord of Missouri criticized Harris' campaign while on the floor of the House of Representatives, claiming that the media had not explained the purpose of the Socialist Workers Party and that it had ties with an \\"international Communist organization\\". Harris' responded to Ichord's accusations, saying that the Socialist Workers Party does not advocate the violent overthrow of the government. Instead, the Socialist Workers Party wanted a drastic change of the nation's economic system to socialism. Keith Jones ran for an at-large seat on the District of Columbia Board of Education.

At the time of his candidacy, Jones was living in Dupont Circle. Jones said that the public school system's problems were linked to education funding being siphoned off to pay for the Vietnam War, residents' lack of control over their own neighborhoods, lack of free daycare and free contraceptives, and the government's low priority to educating students of color.

Manuel equated the District's status as being similar to a Bantustan of apartheid-era South Africa. If elected, Manuel said he would organize people to action on statehood. Nahem came in tenth place, receiving 177 votes, or less than one percent of the total vote.

She said that the solution to violence is to change the economic system to one where human needs are put ahead of corporate profits. On the subject of improving schools in the District, Fitzsimmons said that \\"capitalist rulers of this country\\" reduced school budgets in order to decrease wages and shift the burden of economic decline on workers. She advocated for increased educational funding by the District and federal governments and additional bilingual classes. She called for classes about the history of the working-class movement, sociology, and the history of the struggle for equality by minorities.

Martin said that the District of Columbia Financial Control Board should be abolished and that the District of Columbia should be a state. She was opposed to school closures and decreases to the budget of the University of the District of Columbia. Democrat Linda W.

It represents the coat of arms of Madrid and is found on the east side of the Puerta del Sol, between Calle de Alcal√° and Carrer de San Jer√≥nimo, in the historical centre of the capital.  History  The statue is a work of the sculptor (1906-1983) and it was inaugurated on 19 January 1967. It was promoted by the section of Culture of the City council of Madrid, which wanted to represent the main heraldic symbols of the city in a monument. The first appearance of a wild bear and a strawberry tree on the coat of arms of the city was in the 13th century. Previously, it only incorporated a bear in passant attitude, until it was replaced in the aforementioned century by the two current figures. With this change, they wanted to symbolise the resolution adopted by the municipality and the Chapter of Priests and Beneficiaries after a long litigation about the control of Madrilenian pastures and trees. Since this agreement, the former became property of the Chapter and the latter of the council. From here they modified the arms, including a strawberry tree and of a bear in a new posture: leaning on the tree with both paws. The sculpture has always been in the Puerta del Sol, but in two different locations inside the square. Before 1986, it was situated in the east side of it, in the vicinity of the building between the Calle de Alcal√° and the Carrera St. Jer√≥nimo. That year, it was moved to the front of Carmen Street for the square's reform and remodeling, promoted by mayor Enrique Tierno Galv√°n. In September 2009, with the integral renewal of the square promoted by Alberto Ruiz-Gallard√≥n, it has gone back to its original location.  Description  The Statue of the Bear and the Strawberry Tree is made of stone and bronze. It weighs approximately 22 tons (20 tonnes) and stands 13 ft (4 m) tall. It rests on a staggered cubic pedestal of granite. It represents in a real-life form the coat of arms of Madrid, with the tree taller than the bear, who supports his paws on the trunk and directs his attention towards one of the fruits.

P. rubra are found in extremely deep and cold Pacific Ocean waters. Nomenclature Red paper lantern jellyfish is a common name for this animal because of its mantle that can crumple up or expand like a paper lantern. Another reason for the name was because it was first seen on the coast of Japan and was seen as sacred. Anatomy The red paper lantern is the most common type of P. rubra that has been recorded. This medusa has a transparent, bell-shaped hood measuring about 10 centimeters in diameter and 17 centimeters from top to bottom, with between 14 and 30 tentacles that extend up to 6 times the length of its body. Inside the transparent hood is a deep red colored mantle. JAMSTEC researcher Dr. Dhugal Lindsay is credited with naming it the paper lantern. Range and habitat  P. rubra has only been found in deep and cold ocean waters at only a few sites. So far reported from boreal to sub-boreal waters in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, and also in the Southern Ocean in Japan. They were found at depths between 450-1000m. Environmental ranges: * Depth range (m): 0 - 2697.5 * Temperature range (¬∞C): -1.525 - 4.636 * Nitrate (umol/L): 23.305 - 41.314 * Salinity (PPS): 33.700 - 34.685 * Oxygen (ml/l): 0.881 - 8.065 * Phosphate (umol/l): 1.415 - 3.280 * Silicate (umol/l): 13.206 - 192.813 Behavior P. rubra exhibits bioluminescence, light produced by a chemical reaction within a living organism. Bio-luminescence is a type of luminescence, which is the term for a light-producing chemical reaction. Bio-luminescence is a \\"cold light\\" in that less than 20% of the light generates heat.

Obviously to many to all join their fathers bank. Therefore Samuel Montagu and his partners decided to open a new bank to offer career opportunities for all sons. Controlled by Samuel Montagu, it was managed by two of his employees, Assam Keyser and Gustav Bitter, and named A. Keyser & Co.. The agreement between the three partners was, that each of them would be able to place two sons at Samuel Montagu & Co. and two sons at A. Keyser & Co.. But things did not work out quite like planned and the two companies became completely separate in 1909.Youssef Cassis: City Banker ‚Äì 1890‚Äì1914, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1994, p.219, In The Rise of Merchant Banking, Stanley D.

In the early 1970s the bank, particularly through its managing directors, Roland Franklin and Ian Stoutzker, became very active in corporate finance. One very substantial part of this business was its role as financial adviser to some of the companies associated with Sir James Goldsmith.Margaret Isabel Reid: ‚Ä≥Case Study One: Keyser Ullmann‚Ä≥, Palgrave Macmillan, London 1982, p.170 Demise Sir Edward du Cann, a Member of Parliament (MP) and former chairman of the Conservative Party, was chairman of Keyser Ullman from 1970 to 1975. In October 1974, du Cann and the executive of the 1922 Committee met at du Cann's Keyser Ullman offices in Milk Street, where it was decided that the Committee would press Edward Heath to hold a leadership election, which led to Margaret Thatcher becoming party leader. The press called them the \\"Milk Street Mafia\\".

Conceptually it is similar to the Russian 2S23 \\"Nona-SVK\\" (the turret and weapon system of the 2S9 Nona mounted on a BTR-80 chassis) three of which China purchased for evaluation; at one time it was reported that China would purchase 100 of the Russian vehicles however this failed to occur, nor does it appear that there was a formal transfer of technology to China. The Chinese system features a longer barreled weapon mounted on the Type 92 variant of the WZ551 armored personnel carrier. The gun-mortar is a lighter and more compact artillery piece than the traditional gun-howitzer at the expense of maximum range, and which has the advantage of better accuracy, higher rate of fire and capability of direct fire in comparison to standard infantry mortars. Description PLL-05 The main armament of the PLL-05 is a 120mm gun-mortar in a turret capable of 360¬∞ traverse, this turret being mounted on a 6x6 WZ551 armored personnel carrier chassis. The mortar has an elevation range of -4 to +80 and is capable of both direct and indirect fire. It is fitted with a semi-automatic loader and can be fired in fully automatic, semi-automatic and fully manual modes, the maximum rate of fire being around 8-10 rounds per minute, with a sustained rate of fire being about 4-6 rounds per minute. Ammunition capacity is 36 rounds and include indirect fire mortar bombs and direct fire anti-tank rounds, maximum range with standard mortar bombs being about 9 km. Secondary armament is a QJC-88 12.7√ó108mm heavy machine gun mounted on the turret roof. The crew of four consists of the vehicle commander, gunner, loader and driver. Mobility of the PPL-05 is similar to that of that base WZ551 and the vehicle can swim by way of two rear mounted propellers. History The existence of the PLL-05 was first revealed in 2001 with the system entering service some years later. The PLL-05 was one of the systems that participated in the military parade as part of the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China celebrations. The turret of the PLL-05 was reused on the Type 07PA, a self-propelled gun designed for export.

Located in the desert near Barstow, California, it comprises a 500-kW X-band (8500 MHz) transmitter and a low- noise receiver on the 70-m DSS 14 antenna at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. It has been used to investigate Mercury, Venus, Mars, the asteroids, and moons of Jupiter and Saturn. The most comparable facility is the radar at Arecibo Observatory. Planetary observations GSSR can work in two different modes. In the monostatic radar mode, GSSR both transmits and receives. In bistatic mode, GSSR transmits and other radio astronomy facilities receive. Although more difficult to schedule, this offers two advantages - the transmitter does not need to turn off to allow the receiver to listen, and it allows the use of interferometry to extract more information from the reflected signal. Bodies that have been investigated using GSSR include: *Mercury: In particular, by watching specific reflected features of Mercury sweep across the Earth's surface (using spatially separated receivers), GSSR enables the pole position to be computed quite accurately. The measured librations show Mercury has a liquid core. *Venus *Mars: GSSR was used extensively to characterize sites for Mars landers. *Asteroids: Asteroids appear only as unresolved points of light in ground-based optical telescopes. Radar, however, can image near-Earth asteroids and comets with a resolution of several meters. For example, the asteroid 4179 Toutatis was imaged in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012. Although spacecraft such as Dawn can image particular asteroids in much finer detail, radar astronomy can investigate many more asteroids of different characteristics.

In 1978, members were typically white college graduates in their mid-20s to mid-30s working in white collar jobs. Many had actively opposed the Vietnam War and participated in the civil rights movement and women's equality and ecology movements. From the beginning, PA volunteers donated many hours of personal time to the organization.  Accomplishments  The PA sponsors public and community forums and works with other grassroots organizations such as the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People to jointly fund campaigns. Since its founding in 1975, PA has an extensive catalog of accomplishments.  1970s  In 1959, a 10-mile limited-access project called the East-West Expressway appeared on NCDOT thoroughfare plans. Construction began in 1967 on the first segment of the Expressway. The first segment of the project demolished the historically African-American neighborhood of Hayti. By the early 1970s, about half of the East-West Expressway had been constructed. The next segment of the expressway was directed at another historically African-American neighborhood centered around Crest Street in the 100-year-old community of Hickstown. The PA members recognized the opportunity to fight simultaneously for a number of political values ‚Äì racial justice, interracial cooperation, anti-suburbanization, energy conservation, and environmental protection. With the help of PA members, the Crest Street Community Council (CSCC) was formed in 1975 to oppose the segment of expressway that would demolish the neighborhood. In 1977, with guidance from the PA, the CSCC was able to obtain assistance from the North-Central Legal Assistance Program. The involvement of the PA through the expressway negotiations (1975‚Äì1986) helped all involved parties come to a successful resolution. Michael D. Calhoun, the Legal Aid attorney for the CSCC, argued a case before the US Supreme Court regarding the payment of legal fees accrued during the negotiations. The case was decided on November 4, 1986, in favor of the CSCC. In 1992, the final segment of the East-West Expressway (also known as the Durham Freeway) was completed.  1980s and 1990s  The PA was actively involved in a variety of causes, including taxation, elections, environment, housing, water/wastes/hazards, racial, civil and gender rights, education, and schools.  2000s  A successful bond referendum in 1996 led to the 2008 construction of a transit station on West Chapel Hill Street across the street from the Amtrak train station that serves taxis and local, regional, and national buses. In 2009, PA was engaged with two separate issues over Jordan Lake. One involved re-delineation of the lake boundary by a private developer who stood to gain financially from the change and the second concerned water quality in the lake. PA successfully advocated for the passage of state legislation H239 \\"Restore Water Quality in Jordan Reservoir\\". The PA fought to prevent electronic digital billboards from cropping up along the Durham Freeway and Interstates 40 and 85.  2014 committees  Several PA committees were active in 2014. The Voter Empowerment Committee built a coalition to educate citizens in Durham and surrounding areas about voting changes. The Economic Inequality Committee focused on income inequality by developing a plan for a voluntary living wage campaign. After almost a decade of PA advocating to the DPS School Board and administration, a significant expansion of the teacher mentoring and principal leadership training programs finally took place. The Housing Committee advocates continued to fight for affordable and supportive housing near public transit. The PA supports the Southern Coalition, Durham NAACP, and Fostering Alternative Drug Enforcement (FADE) in questioning racial profiling by Durham Police. Their five policy recommendations were designed to end disparities and make the DPD more accountable, ensuring that civil rights are respected. # Implement a mandatory written consent-to-search policy for all vehicle searches # Make marijuana enforcement the Durham Police Department's lowest law enforcement priority # Implement a policy requiring mandatory periodic review of officer stop data # Reform and strengthen the Durham Civilian Police Review Board # Mandate that the Durham Police Department participate in formal racial equity training These recommendations came into effect on October 1, 2014.  2015 Action Teams  Economic Inequality advocates for policies that ensure that all Durham residents have access to high-quality jobs that pay a living wage with benefits and the opportunity to acquire and make use of productive assets. The Education Team works to support a unified public education system for Durham families. The Coalition for Affordable Housing and Transit advocates for residents of all incomes so they can afford to live near rail transit stations and bus hubs in Durham.  Public Office PA members  These People's Alliance members have held public office: * Diane Catotti (Durham City Council) * Don Moffitt (Durham City Council) * Eddie Davis (Durham City Council) * Frank Hyman (Durham City Council) * Lanier Fonvielle-Blum (Durham City Council) * Lorisa Seibel (Durham City Council) * Mike Woodard (Durham City Council/NC State Senate) * Paul Luebke (NC State House of Representatives) * Steve Schewel (Durham School Board, Durham City Council, Mayor) * Wendy Jacobs (Durham County Commission) * Wib Gulley (Durham Mayor, NC State Senate) Longtime Durham Mayor Bill Bell retired in 2017. Steve Schewel was elected as the new mayor in the November 2017 elections  People's Alliance Fund  The 501c(3) fund financially supports progressive educational and research activities in Durham and other North Carolina communities. They provide microgrants to progressive organizations needing one-time assistance for meetings, supplies, and educational materials. Several conferences and initiatives have received funding. The Southern Anti-Racism Network (SARN) Ella Baker Tour (2008) was a tour by 1960s veterans of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The tour included a stop in Durham for events at North Carolina Central University and Duke University. Five scholarships distributed through the Southern Anti-Racism Network for low-income Durham residents to participate in the One Nation Working Together march on Washington in October 2010. The march was organized by a broad coalition of labor, civil rights, and other progressive organizations. The WNCU-FM \\"Keep It Kool\\" Project (2012) was an emergency project by the nonprofit radio station at North Carolina Central University in Durham so that they could purchase and install new air conditioning for the station's failing transmitter, allowing it to run at full capacity during the hot summer of 2012. For the People's Alliance Forum on Economic Inequality and the Economy (2013), distinguished local academics and activists discussed the crisis of income inequality in North Carolina and issues related to poverty and jobs. Participants included Gene Nichol of the University of North Carolina School of Law, Rob Schofield of NC Policy Watch, Sandy Darity of the Sanford School of Public Policy, and Jeff Ward of the Duke University Law School.

Members of the group traditionally spoke the Yidiny language. Yidiny is a great warrior tribe with their Nalan (law people) residing in the Cairns area. Language The last fluent speakers of Yidiny were Tilly Fuller (d. October 1974), George Davis (b.1919), Dick Moses (b.1898) and his sister Idea Burnett of White Rock. A substantial part of the language has been analysed and recorded by Robert M. W. Dixon. Country The Yidiny lands were in lowland rainforest areas, stretching from Yarrabah down to the south, where their borders met those of the Ngajanji and the Wanyurr. To their north were the coastal Djabugay people. In Norman Tindale's calculation, the Yidiny tribal lands were estimated to cover some . These included the areas of Deeral north to Gordonvale and Cairns. Their inland extension ran as far as Lake Barrine. Their eastern boundary was on the crest of the Prior Range. Social organization The Yidiny were composed of several Clans, of which some names survive:- * Gimuy * Walubara * Maiara * Maimbi * Djumbandji History The Yidiny, along with many other tribal people in the tropical rainforest areas from Cairns to Ingham, and the Atherton Tableland were cleared off their land to enable the establishment of cattle stations and sugar cane plantations. Jack Kane participated in some massacres as a youth and recalled, in 1938 one episode alone in 1884, during a week-long campaign to round up the tribes, Queensland police and native troopers, encircled a Yidiny camp at what became known as Skull Pocket, several miles north of Yungaburra. At dawn, a shot was fired from one side into the camp to make them scatter, and then as they rushed into the ambushing forces elsewhere, were shot down. The native police then stabbed or smashed the brains of the children. One group of the Yidiny, broke off from the rest of the tribe in the early period of settlement, and after shifting to the area of the present-day Redlynch asserted a distinctive identity by calling themselves the Djumbandji. This segment took over a part of Buluwai territory. Starting around 1910, even those who remained in the area of white settlement were the object of a Queensland government policy of shifting them into the Anglican mission at Yarrabah on the Cape Grafton peninsula. As each tribe was weakened by dispersal and fragmentation, the elders formed a counter-plan in the 1920s to organise themselves into a more viable political unit, in the shape of a macro-tribe, but the merger failed to take hold, given the notable linguistic differences between groups. Sovereignty In 2014, 40 members of the Yidiny tribe, led by Murrumu Walubara Yidindji (formerly Jeremy Geia) renounced legal ties with Australia to form the Sovereign Yidindji Government, claiming sovereignty over the lands from south of Port Douglas to Cairns and the Atherton Tablelands, including territorial waters reaching eastwards 80 km in the Pacific. The government thus formed presented itself as similar to that of Vatican City. Indigenous activist and Professor of Law Megan Davis commented that there were no legal problems in the Australian government entering into a treaty with such groups. The issues were purely political, in her view.

Savoeun was promoted from Deputy National Police Chief to the most senior law enforcement position of the country in November 2008 after his predecessor, Hok Lundy, whose tenure was mired in controversy and accusations of corruption, died in a helicopter crash. Savoeun, who was 52 years old at the time of his appointment, is married to Prime Minister Hun Sen's niece, Hun Kimleng. Prior to the National Police force, Savoeun was the police chief of Phnom Penh during the State of Cambodia and then, after the 1993 elections, head of the justice department in the Interior Ministry‚Äôs Penal Crimes Division. Background Savoeun is a long-time member of the ruling Cambodian People's Party, which, according to international observers, has dominated politics and held on to power in Cambodia since 1979 through corruption, including extralegal killings, election fraud, control of the media, and at times, open violence such as the 1997 coup and 2015 intimidation of the opposition CNRP deputy leader, Kem Sokha. Within the CPP, Savoeun is a member of its Central Committee, the body responsible for all core decision making, and maintains close ties with Hun Sen, to whose niece he married in the early 1990s. From 1989‚Äì1993, Savoeun was the city police chief in the capital, Phnom Penh during the turbulent transition period after the Vietnamese withdrew from Cambodia. After the UN's 1992‚Äì1993 protectorate led to elections and the formation of the current Kingdom of Cambodia, Savoeun was given a post in the Interior Ministry as the leader of the Penal Crimes Division's justice department. During the mid 2000s, he was made a Deputy Chief of the National Police Force. Throughout his career thus far, Savoeun had been plagued by accusations of \\"committing human rights abuses\\". Tenure as National Police Chief Savoeun was chosen to succeed Hoc Lundy by Hun Sen and appointed by royal decree of Cambodian king Norodom Sihamoni on 11 November 2008. He was officially sworn into office on 21 November by Interior Minister Sar Kheng amid allegations of nepotism and lack of qualifications. Kem Sokha, who at the time was president of the Human Rights Party, remarked \\"...he has not graduated from the Police Academy, and his rank comes from his relations to a high-ranking official, or nepotism\\", but he and others such as Chan Soveth of ADHOC and Interior Minister Sar Kheng expressed hope that Savoeun would discontinue the practices of his predecessor and reform the organization even though the National Police had never been allowed to operate independently of the CPP-controlled government. As police chief, Savoeun has made many overtures with the apparent goal of making Cambodia more secure. In March 2015 he took steps to deal with \\"foreign mafia\\" in Sihanoukville, which included replacing the Sihanoukville Province police chief, in response to increasing violence among high-profile Russian businessmen in the area. Also in March, Savoeun threatened to fire police officials for not acting to stop a series of brazen armed robberies of jewelry stores and tourists around the nation. Savoeun called a high level meeting in September in which he announced plans to crack down on human trafficking, a nationwide problem in Cambodia. During an internal promotion ceremony in October 2015, Savoeun scolded police at all levels, saying they need to work better with citizens and \\"behave better\\" in general if they expect to be promoted. Despite such high-profile efforts, however, the National Police force, and Savoeun in particular, are still used as tools of the CPP. Hun Sen and the CPP regularly use uniformed military and police leaders, including General Savoeun to campaign during elections. In August 2015 Hun Sen tasked Savoeun with arresting Teav Vannol, an outspoken senator of the opposition party for comments he made regarding Hun Sen's allegedly pro-Vietnamese interpretations of Cambodian-Vietnamese treaties. In 2010, Hun Sen sent Savoeun on a personal mission to track down the Prime Minister's nephew who had abandoned his wife. In October, after Savoeun's police ignored the calls of Kem Sokha's wife for help when her house was surrounded and pelted by rocks for six hours by a pro-CPP mob, Hun Sen announced that Savoeun would not accept being replaced if the CNRP won the next elections.

Beardslee, son of Dr. Gideon and Sarah Ann (Curtiss) Beardslee, was born in that part of Huntington which is since 1823 the town of Monroe, Conn., July 2, 1807. His father died in 1826. He graduated from Yale College in 1826 and in May, 1827, he began the study of medicine in New Haven, graduating at the Medical Institution in 1829. He shortly after opened an office in Montville, Conn., and soon had an extensive but laborious country practice. He was elected to the Connecticut State Legislature in 1844. In May, 1845, he removed to Painesville, Ohio, where he devoted himself for the rest of his life to his profession, becoming especially skillful and successful in the more difficult surgical operations. The most laborious portion of Dr. Beardslee's professional life was from 1863 to 1865, when as examining surgeon for his Congressional district he examined upwards of 12,000 candidates for military service in the American Civil War. His health failed in 1882, and the last three years were years of great and increasing weakness. Outside of his profession he was especially interested in botany, and has left an unpublished catalogue of the plants of Ohio, compiled for the use of the Geological survey. He died in Painesville, December 21, 1884, in his 78th year. He married in the spring of 1833 Harriet Hawley, of Monroe, by whom he had three daughters and two sons. She died July 8, 1860, and in November, 1861, he married Clementine M. Carrier, of Enfield, N. H. She survived him with her three sons, and a daughter and a son by his first marriage.

Kitromilides (born 11 May 1949) in Nicosia, Cyprus, is a Greek- Cypriot political scientist and intellectual historian. His expertise is on the history of political thought. His special field of research is the Enlightenment in South-eastern Europe, focusing on the central role of its Neohellenic component. He is a professor of political science at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens since 1983.Paschalis M. Kitromilides. National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Retrieved 5 November 2015. He was elected full member of the Academy of Athens on 6 February 2020. Education and career Prof. Kitromilides was born on 5 May 1949 in Nicosia, then in British Cyprus, the first son of philologists Michael and Magda Kitromilides. After secondary studies at the Pancyprian Gymnasium and military service in the Cypriot National Guard in 1968-69, he earned a Fulbright scholarship allowing him to study in the United States. He earned his BA in political science and modern European history from Wesleyan University (B.A. with Highest Honours in Government, 1972). He holds an MA (1975) and a PhD in political science from Harvard University where he studied under Michael Walzer and Judith Shklar, two distinguished American scholars of their time. He completed his degree in 1979 with his dissertation bearing the title, ‚ÄúTradition, Enlightenment and Revolution: Ideological Change in Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Greece.‚Äù Prior to assuming his position at the University of Athens (1983), Prof. Kitromilides taught at Harvard University (1978-1979). He has also taught at Brandeis University (1987), and has held visiting appointments at the University of Cambridge (1989-1990, as Visiting Fellow and Life Member of Clare Hall), the University of Oxford (1993,1997), the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris (1990, 2001), the European University Institute in Florence (2010) and the Harvard University Centre for Italian Renaissance Studies Villa I Tatti, Florence (2012). He is a board member of the Hellenic Parliament Academic Council (2004‚Äìpresent) and director of the Centre for Asia Minor Studies (1980‚Äìpresent, as successor of ), past director of the Centre for Modern Greek Studies at the National Hellenic Research Foundation in Athens (2000-2011) and past president of the Cyprus Research Centre (2006-2009), the European Society for the History of Political Thought (2009-2011) and the Hellenic Political Science Association (1988-1992). He regularly writes in the Greek weekly newspaper To Vima. Scholarship Since his doctoral dissertation (Harvard University, 1979) Kitromilides has devoted his research to the study of Modern Greek Enlightenment, an academic field that was initially developed by . While Dimaras was a pioneer in singling out the phenomenon and its main representatives, as well as in referring to their literary dimensions, Kitromilides turned his analysis to political ideas and the context of historical vicissitudes, social dynamics and western Enlightenment influences which could lead a traditional Balkan, Ottoman-dominated society to modernity and change (see in Publications below, Enlightenment and Revolution, ‚ÄúImagined Communities‚Äù, Enlightenment, Nationalism, Orthodoxy). His adherence to the Cambridge School of intellectual history and the history of political thought was not unconformable to his emphasis on leading figures in Greek political and cultural affairs, to whom he dedicated extended articles, collective works and monographs (Adamantios Korais and the European Enlightenment, The Complete Works of Rigas Velestinlis, The Enlightenment as Social Criticism. Iosipos Moisiodax and Greek Culture in the Eighteenth Century). Over the years, Kitromilides developed interests in the intellectual and cultural horizon of Greek post-Byzantine cultural tradition since 1453, which he perceived to be grounded in Orthodoxy and the Greek language, elements that contributed to a Commonwealth under the guidance of the Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople (see in Publications below, The Orthodox Commonwealth, ‚ÄúEnlightenment and Greek Cultural Tradition‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrthodoxy and the West‚Äù). In this context Kitromilides placed in particular the study of Asia Minor Hellenism, that is, the ecclesiastical, social and intellectual experience of Asia Minor Greek populations covering the modern era till the expulsion of these communities from Asia Minor in the 1920s. That field of research he was able to develop through his extensive publishing and editorial activity at the Centre for Asia Minor Studies. Kitromilides‚Äôs main preoccupation throughout his academic career was to introduce the canon of Western political thought into Greek academia. While early modern and modern Greek reflection remained the primary subject of his publications and research, Kitromilides has devoted almost his entire teaching at the University of Athens, as well as some university textbooks, to the grand theorists of classical political science from Plato to the Enlightenment. Kitromilides has also written on Cypriot history and political affairs, his native land‚Äôs political and historical complexity serving as the basis for many of his academic publications. In 2002 he issued a prosopography of Cypriot intellectuals and in 2008 he launched a major research and editorial project on sources of Cypriot learning (1571-1878) published by the National Hellenic Research Foundation.

Wildwood House Conversations in Bloomsbury is a 1981 memoir that depicts writer Mulk Raj Anand's life in London during the heyday of the Bloomsbury Group, and his relationships with the group's members. It provides a rare insight into the intimate workings of the English modernist movement, portraying such prominent figures as Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot and D. H. Lawrence. Anand challenges the cultural narrative that many have received about these literary figures.  Visions of the Bloomsbury Group  Anand leaves a snapshot of the Bloomsbury Group for posterity, focalizing the individuals within the group through issues of colonial prejudice. His revelations, written decades after his experiences, and retrospectively framed by a postcolonial perspective, often give uncomfortable perspectives on the racist and casually jingoistic attitudes of a seemingly liberal movement. Commentary often engages with the significance of the British 'civilising' mission. Comments include T.S. Eliot's remark 'I wish that Indians would tone down their politics and renew their culture'.Mulk Raj Anand, Conversations in Bloomsbury (Delhi: Oxford UP, 1995) 150. Retrospectively, it is possible to point out shortcomings of these writers, inviting a re-examination of their work. The text gives a highly subjective reading of the Bloomsbury Group, one which is elevated from a biographical recording to a complex and amusing satire of intellectual prejudice, by virtue of Anand's position on the margins of the group. The form of the text allows Anand to set up an ironic distance between the voices of the Bloomsbury Group and the silent undercurrents of their conversations. The prejudices and biases of the group become glaringly obvious because Anand guides the reader to see the dismissal of colonial cruelties that the insular nature of the group prevents them from seeing themselves. Anand expresses particular disillusion with the group's ignorance of other cultures, arguing that this is an obstacle to the modernist endeavour. He is also critical of their disengagement with both national and international politics, particularly on the issue of Indian independence.  Genre and Form  Published in 1981, the text's frame of reference leads the reader to question the veracity of Anand's account. Most of the people he comes across have extensive bodies of work, and the reader cannot be sure where the line is between the people he met in 1920s London and the perceived personas of these writers years later. Described by Anand in the dedication to the 1981 edition as 'gossip' and as 'reminiscences' by Saros Cowasjee (Introduction), Conversations can be classified as life writing. It resembles a memoir, with the 'snapshot' style of the narrative implying that there is an element of entertainment to its construction. The text shows stylistic influences as wide as melodrama and travel writing. Anand shows the personalities of historical figures outside of their literary context. The text also shows a self-conscious understanding of its author's own intellectual maturation. Ultimately, Conversations in Bloomsbury takes the form of the memoir rather than an autobiography; the episodic conversations are structured around Anand's personal interest rather than any particular narrative. This makes his recollections of his relationships deeply personal and thereby potentially unreliable. Although the conversations may not be recorded verbatim, he gives a sense of the personalities and opinions of each figure. The very literary nature of his encounters and conversations are sometimes strained and point towards a certain degree of implausibility. For example, in chapter eighteen, Anand asks \\"is it about India?\\" as his first question of a new novel. He requires an alert reader to realize the ironies embedded within his writing which echoes a modernist approach to writing. The conversations in structure also are never truly resolved; this echoes the colonial and subsequently post-colonial issues that trouble Anand throughout his narrative. Martha Jane Nadell in \\"Modernism and Race\\" points towards the traditional tension between race and modernism as modernism, though apparently progressive, ignored issues of race. Conversations in Bloomsbury realises this tension through his unfinished conversations, inability to express himself and follow strict codes of English conduct.  Purpose  As a text that blurs the lines between memoir, fiction, and autobiography, Conversations enacts numerous textual aspirations. It is at once a portrait of an Indian ingenue and autodidact making his way, problematically, at times, into the inner circle of the Bloomsbury group; a biographical snapshot of the group's venerated literary figures; and the ways in which Anand attempts to assert himself, and by extension, India and Indian culture, into the conversations surrounding empire and colonialism in the progressive circle of the Bloomsbury group. Anand demonstrates how the canonical modernists' discussions and texts, despite the progressive views that they represent, nevertheless demonstrate their heritage of an imperial discourse. He shows that \\"modernism sought energies in the strangeness and distance of the other... in the terms that seemed to fit into its essentially Eurocentric framework\\". The conversations‚Äîinaccessible as they are‚Äîare way of situating Indian culture at the same level as English culture. By depicting multiple conversations between himself and canonical British authors such as Virginia Woolf and T.S. Eliot, Anand equates himself as one of the Bloomsbury group. Although this could be seen as a mere tool of self-promotion, it also makes the point that the Indian culture Anand comes from is just as important as British culture.  Historical disparities  The historical gap between the writing, subsequent publication and the experiences depicted in Conversations in Bloomsbury gives Anand license to imagine the past and the Bloomsbury Group. However, almost contradictorily Anand is legitimised by the undeniable fact that he was there. This contradiction is allowed for by the fact that Conversations is a memoir. The substantial distance between experience and publication allows for an extremely critical perspective, contrary to Anna Snaith's perspective of the bloomsbury group as representing \\"a Britishness to do with bohemian modernity and intellectual freedoms\\", we are shown a collection of individuals who, although perceiving themselves to be at the forefront of liberal Britain, are often in fact ignorant in their conduct as regards Anands own culture and experience of British rule in India. As Anand publishes his conversations in the 1980s, the authors he engages with have already been firmly cemented within the English literary modernist canon, only confirmed by the fact that most of them had passed away. He chooses to publish his book at a time when postcolonial critical theory is at its height, suggesting that perhaps he is deliberately satirising the revered status of the Bloomsbury Group at a time when it was popular to scrutinise modernist ideas under postcolonial light, playing on their affirmed celebrity status, made possible only by this historical gap.  The tension in the book between expos√© and homage  There is a distinct tension in the text between its presumed purpose as an expos√© of the Bloomsbury group and as an homage: The second edition of the text is dedicated to the memory of Leonard and Virginia Woolf and E.M. Forster, suggesting a deferential and reverent attitude towards the famous Modernist circle. This is evident in the text in Anand's presentation of himself as a nervous young student of the writers her portrays; he is awestruck and nervous at meeting famous figures such as T.S Eliot and Aldous Huxley. Eliot seems to act as Anand's mentor and he does menial work for Hogarth Press of which there is no record of payment. He constantly demonstrates self-consciousness of his cultural Otherness and attempts to assimilate his behaviour with English customs. For example, he tries to eat soup quietly like an Englishman rather than slurping it in accordance with Indian stereotypes. However, at the same time there is a distinct undercurrent of cultural critique and social satire of both the literary figures and London as a metropolitan centre. The parallels drawn between the Indian caste system and the separation of Public and Private bars in London reveals how Anand is critical of the notion that the metropolitan centre is superior to its colonial counterpart. Anand constantly presents the famous figures as prejudiced against and ignorant of Indian customs and culture. These writers put forth their opinion on Indian culture without recognition of their ethnocentrism. For example, T. S. Eliot is shown to be narrow-minded about Indian religion despite its inclusion in his famous poem The Waste Land. Similarly, Clive Bell is depicted as ignorant of the wealth of Indian art, calling it 'crude craftwork' because it does not fit in with his Western notion of art for art's sake.  Depiction of Colonialism  Conversations in Bloomsbury depicts the London literary scene of the 1920s and 30s. A theme that runs throughout the conversations is Indian independence and the value of Indian culture. Anand brings this topic up with almost every writer featured. His own position is in favour of independence from British rule, demonstrated by his support of Gandhi's movement and being briefly jailed for his activism. Writing in a post-independence India, Anand focuses on the variety of positions he encounters within the London literary elite. These vary from the dismissal of Clive Bell to the more progressive anti-imperialist attitudes of E.M. Forster and Leonard Woolf.  The Bloomsbury Set  Anand presents the majority of the Bloomsbury Set as being relatively anti-imperialist, citing ethical objection as Leonard Woolf's main motivation for leaving the Civil Service in Ceylon. The Woolfs' Hogarth Press notably published a number of anti-imperialist texts and marginalised writers. E.M. Forster is also portrayed as anti-imperialist in his writings and attitudes. Anand specifically cites A Passage to India as a superior and more sympathetic representation of India, in contrast to Rudyard Kipling's Kim, which is praised in the opening chapters by Bonamy Dobr√©e. Although most of the Bloomsbury Set are relatively kind and embracing of Anand and anti- imperialist attitudes, Gretchen Gerzina has argued that whilst 'the Bloomsbury Group may have been radicals in Edwardian English society, they were not radical enough. To take seriously a viewpoint utterly removed from their own intellectual aesthetic world.' Anand aligns with this statement in his portrayal of core member Clive Bell, whose portrayal is far more negative than the Woolfs and other members of the Bloomsbury Set. His attitude towards Anand and Indian art in general is highly dismissive, as he criticises the aesthetics that don't align with his own definitions. Anand highlights his distinction between art and craft, and dismissal of Indian art as 'merely craft'.  Anand's self-presentation  Anand as: Memoirist: it's a lot about other people His book that he never seems to actually write or think about Little focus on his interiority He's just as clever as he was then He also only talks about the exciting members Naive: Eliot orders for him The form (memoir) mimics the erudite yet shallow nature of the conversations, which is also how he sees the Bloomsbury Group. Indian: adoption of \\"european techniques\\": cf Untouchable, London as I see it (flaneur) His accent/language: he slips into his own \\"lingo\\", self-deprecating He works in their basement on a pointless project - (Leonard and Virginia Woolf, The Hogarth Press and the Networks of Modernism - Helen Southworth) A lot of what he says seems to come from Dance of Siva by Coomaraswarmy: he's finding out about his own country from a book of \\"fourteen Indian essays\\" that he only found out about As a text that blurs the lines between memoir, fiction, and autobiography, Conversations enacts numerous textual aspirations. It is at once a portrait of an Indian ingenue and autodidact making his way, problematically, at times, into the inner circle of the Bloomsbury group; a biographical snapshot of the group's venerated literary figures; and an illustration of the ways in which Anand attempts to assert himself, and by extension, India and Indian culture, into his conversations with the coterie of Bloomsbury intellectuals surrounding politics (imperialism), philosophy, and literature. Anand demonstrates how the canonical modernists' discussions and texts, despite the progressive views that they represent, nevertheless demonstrate their heritage of an imperial discourse. He shows that \\"modernism sought energies in the strangeness and distance of the other... in the terms that seemed to fit into its essentially Eurocentric framework\\" (Simon Gikandi in 'Geomodernisms: Race, Modernism and Modernity') The conversations‚Äîinaccessible as they are‚Äîare way of situating Indian culture at the same level as English culture. By depicting multiple conversations between himself and canonical British authors such as Virginia Woolf and T.S. Eliot, Anand equates himself as one of the Bloomsbury group. Although this could be seen as a mere tool of self-promotion, it also makes the point that the Indian culture Anand comes from is just as important as British culture.  The text's relationship to modernism  As an Indian living in a society with a strong imperial presence in India that held the prejudice that came with it, Anand struggled to find his place within the intellectual community of Bloomsbury. He found himself having to assimilate to the culture in order to fit in. In the text, he describes how he exercised self-restraint over his strong political views, and engages in an internal dialogue in which he examines the role that race plays within literary modernism. The text gives an insight into how his cultural background contributed to shaping his experience as a writer working within Eurocentric structures. He dismantles the image of modernist writers by exposing and critiquing the prejudices that influence their work. Despite his critical view of his modernist contemporaries, Anand was nonetheless influenced and inspired by them. Conversations alludes to the influence of writers such as James Joyce and his introspective novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man on Anand's own emergence as a young writer. In the memoir, Anand perceives himself as a social commodity for the Bloomsbury group; he feels accepted more for his cultural identity than his intellect and personality. The group's members seem to think they already understand Indian culture. They use Anand's company not as an opportunity to learn, but rather to have their judgments received and ratified by a colonial subject.

High touch refers to higher degree of complexity in terms of distribution, administration, or patient management which drives up the cost of the drugs. In the early years specialty pharmacy providers attached \\"high-touch services to their overall price tags\\" arguing that patients who receive specialty pharmaceuticals \\"need high levels of ancillary and follow-up care to ensure that the drug spend is not wasted on them.\\" An example of a specialty drug that would only be available through specialty pharmacy is interferon beta-1a (Avonex), a treatment for MS that requires a refrigerated chain of distribution and costs $17,000 a year. Some specialty pharmacies deal in pharmaceuticals that treat complex or rare chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, H.I.V. psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or Hepatitis C. \\"Specialty pharmacies are seen as a reliable distribution channel for expensive drugs, offering patients convenience and lower costs while maximizing insurance reimbursements from those companies that cover the drug. Patients typically pay the same co- payments whether or not their insurers cover the drug.\\" As the market demanded specialization in drug distribution and clinical management of complex therapies, specialized pharma (SP) evolved.¬Ñ Specialty pharmacies may handle therapies that are biologics, and are injectable or infused (although some are oral medications). By 2008 the pharmacy benefit management dominated the specialty pharmacies market having acquired smaller specialty pharmacies. PBMs administer specialty pharmacies in their network and can \\"negotiate better prices and frequently offer a complete menu of specialty pharmaceuticals and related services to serve as an attractive 'one-stop shop' for health plans and employers.\\" In the mid 1990s, there were fewer than 30 specialty drugs on the market, but by 2008 that number had increased to 200. History Specialty pharmacies initially served a limited number of people with a small number of high-cost, low-volume, and high-maintenance conditions, such as hemophilia and Gaucher's disease. In 1991 the FDA approved the first version of Genzyme's orphan drug alglucerase, the only treatment for Gaucher's disease. At that time, according to Genzyme CEO Henri Termeer ‚Äî a pioneer in the biotechnology industry business model ‚Äî one treatment of Ceredase for one patient took 22,000 placentas annually to manufacture, a difficult and expensive procedure. A new version of Ceredase, called Cerezyme, Imiglucerase which Genzyme produced in 1994 using genetically modified cells in vitro, was cheaper and easier to produce, was approved in several countries. In 2005 there were only about 4,500 patients on Cerezyme. In marketing imiglucerase, Termeer introduced the innovative and successful business strategy that became a model for the biotechnology or life sciences industry in general and specialty pharmacy in particular. Genzyme's added revenue from profits on the highly priced orphan or specialty drugs like imiglucerase, which had no competition, was used to undertake research and development for other drugs and to allow them to fund programs that distribute a small portion of production for free. In 2005 he then created what would eventually become a feature service of specialty pharmacy, by hiring 34 people to help patients acquire insurance plans that would cover the cost of their drugs. By 2005 although Cerezyme cost the average patient (including babies) $200,000 a year, it could cost a single adult patient as much as $520,000 a year even though it cost Genzyme less than $52,000 to manufacture, because the alternative is severe debilitation and early death. In 2005 there were only about 4,500 patients on Cerezyme. In 1992 Stadtlanders Pharmacy ‚Äî a subsidiary of Bergen Brunswig Corporation ‚Äî was a grassroots company in Pittsburgh that occupied one floor of a seven-story office building and had only a handful of employees and sold drugs by mail-order to patients with chronic conditions with \\"higher- than-average prescription prices\\". In 1992 this included \\"ancillary to primary therapy to manage side effects, as well as HIV, transplant, and a new growth area, multiple sclerosis (MS).\\" By 1995 Stadtlanders added others, including growth hormones. Compared to retail drugstores that dealt in high volumes of lower margin drugs, Stadtlanders successful business model focused on lower volumes of higher priced drugs resulting in \\"healthier revenues.\\" By about 1995 there were fewer than 30 specialty drugs on the market. By 2000 Stadtlanders \\"generated annual revenues of $500 million by selling drugs by mail-order to patients with chronic conditions.\\" In the 1990s specialized pharmacies were mainly mom-and-pop organizations and the specialty pharmacy industry was highly fragmented. In the 1990s more expensive lifesaving therapies became available. Pharmacies like Stadtlanders began to do more than fill prescriptions. They would fill out the cumbersome insurance paperwork for patients to secure reimbursement ‚Äî often from Medicare ‚Äî coordinate \\"benefits to eliminate the potentially enormous out-of-pocket costs.\\" They were able to keep these specialty drugs in stock when most retail pharmacies could not. In this way they could intervene for patients who \\"needed immediate access to therapies to prevent organ rejection\\" but who \\"did not have the money for such payments, nor did they have the expertise they needed to complete the forms.\\" These \\"pharmacies also coordinated referrals from hospital discharge planners and delivered the medication to the patients‚Äô homes to allow therapy to begin immediately upon hospital discharge.\\" In 1999 CVS launched ProCare, a \\"chain of specialty pharmacies, about 1,500 square feet in size, serving patients with chronic diseases and conditions that require complex and expensive drug regimens.\\" CVS was an early pioneer in online mail-delivery prescription filling service which it operated through CVS.com, a rebranded website it acquired with the 1999 purchase of Soma.com, the first major online pharmacy. By September 2000 when CVS acquired Stadtlander for $124 million Stadtlanders had become \\"one of the largest employers\\" in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. By 1999, the market for specialty pharmaceuticals was estimated at about $16 billion and it was \\"a particularly fast-growing segment of the drug industry.\\" CVS became a consolidator in the special pharmacy market. By the end of 2000, CVS's specialty pharmacy business consisted of mail-order operations and 46 CVS ProCare pharmacies located in 17 states and the District of Columbia. Overall, CVS saw its revenues surpass the $20 billion mark for the first time in 2000, while net income reached a record $746 million.\\" By 2001 CVS' specialty pharmacy ProCare was the \\"largest integrated retail/mail provider of specialty pharmacy services\\" in the United States. It was consolidated with their pharmacy benefit management company, PharmaCare in 2002. In their 2001 annual report CVS anticipated that the \\"$16 billion specialty pharmacy market\\" would grow at \\"an even faster rate than traditional pharmacy due in large part to the robust pipeline of biotechnology drugs.\\" Niche independents like Stadtlanders and smaller specialty pharmacies acquired by larger corporations as the specialty pharmacy industry‚Äôs \\"profitability grew exponentially.\\" By 2008 the specialty pharmacy marketplace was \\"dominated primarily by traditional\\" pharmacy benefit management that \\"merged with previously existing specialty pharmacies, or those that are retail-based or insurer-owned. These organizations typically have the muscle to negotiate better prices and frequently offer a complete menu of specialty pharmaceuticals and related services to serve as an attractive 'one-stop shop' for health plans and employers.\\" By 2007 specialty costs began to drive pharmacy trend. According to Express Scripts 2007 Drug Trend Report in 2007 there was a 14% increase in specialty drugs. There was a 60.4% increase in utilization, a 37.4% increase in costs and a 4.9% increase in new medications. By 2008 there were more than 200 specialty pharmaceuticals on the market. By 2014 CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and Walgreens represented more than 50% of the specialty drug market in the United States. other specialty providers included Commcare Pharmacy. By 2015 the trend among U.S. pharmacies is to \\"incorporate specialty pharmacy in their operations.\\" Specialty pharmacy offers services such as \\"adherence management, benefits investigation, and patient education, and the challenge of space limitations for item stocking.\\"via EBSCO Pharmacy benefit management (PBM) Pharmacy benefit management ‚Äî working with employers, health plans companies and government programs ‚Äî dominate the specialty pharmacy market in the United States since at 2008. According to the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), \\"Historically, a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) is a third-party administrator of prescription drug programs. PBMs are primarily responsible for developing and maintaining the formulary, contracting with pharmacies, negotiating discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers, and processing and paying prescription drug claims. For the most part, they work with self-insured companies and government programs striving to maintain or reduce the pharmacy expenditures of the plan while concurrently trying to improve health care outcomes.\\" Further reading * This brief article contains valuable information about the history of specialty pharmacy.

It is found in mountainous areas of central Europe and in China, where it grows on conifers. Taxonomy Laetiporus montanus was first described as new to science by Czech mycologist Karel ƒåern√Ω in 1989. However, the publication did not include a Latin description of the species, nor did it indicate the type, so the name was invalid according to nomenclatural rules. Michal Tom≈°ovsk√Ω and Libor Jankovsk√Ω published the species validly in 2009. Although the fruit body of L. montanus is morphologically indistinguishable from the widespread L. sulphureus, it is distinct genetically. Description Fruitbodies consist of overlapping fan-shaped caps up to wide and thick. The upper surface of the fruit body is bright orange before fading to light brownish in age. The pores on the cap underside are initially bright yellow, but fade to pale tan. Pores are small, measuring 1 to 4 per millimetre. Spores are egg-shaped, hyaline (translucent), and measure 6.0‚Äì8.0 ¬µm. It has larger spores than other European Laetiporus species; for example, spores of L. sulphureus typically do not exceed 7.0 ¬µm in length. Habitat, distribution, and ecology Like all Laetiporus species, L. montanus causes a brown rot in its host trees. It grows on mature conifers, particularly Picea abies and Larix decidua. In Europe, the fungus has been recorded from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria. In 2010, it was reported from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the first record from China. The actual distribution of the fungus is not well known; the authors suspect that it may have a wider distribution, including Switzerland and adjacent mountainous countries. It is restricted to elevations above . Insects known to rear their young in the fruit bodies of L. montanus include the Dipteran species Ula bolitophila and Spelobia parapusio.

He was the Venetian ambassador to Constantinople, and became the first bailo of Corfu in 1389. Amongst his other diplomatic appointments, he served as Provveditore of Crete in 1363, captain of Crete in 1389, and duke of Crete in 1395. He also served as bailo and captain of Negroponte.  Diplomatic career  Barbo was sent as Venetian ambassador to Constantinople on the occasion of the death of John V Palaiologos \\"to express the Republic's distress 'at the death of our true and perfect friend'\\" and to liaise with John V's successor Manuel II Palaiologos. In 1386 Barbo accompanied Venetian diplomat Lorenzo de Monacis to Hungary representing Venice's interests during a crisis involving the succession to the Hungarian throne. The diplomatic mission was successful as described in a report by de Monacis to the Venetian government. In 1389, Barbo accompanied de Monacis again on another diplomatic mission to Hungary when they fell victims to robbery. The two diplomats, having lost all their belongings during the incident, received 60 gold ducats as compensation by the Maggior Consiglio of Venice. Sentence Barbo participated in a diplomatic proposal by the Doge of Venice Antonio Venier involving giving the island of Tenedos to John V Palaiologos instead of destroying it according to the Venetian plan \\"factum ruynationis Tenedi\\". According to the Doge, \\"it would be offensive to God and to all mankind to disperse the Greek population of Tenedos and to destroy everything on the island\\". The doge also wanted to keep the island as an aid to maritime navigation and argued that the Ottomans could rebuild it even if the Venetians destroyed it. However the proposal of the Doge did not succeed due to Genoan and Venetian opposition. In the aftermath of the diplomatic crisis, Barbo was sentenced on 17 April 1383 to \\"deprivation of all offices of state for ten years\\". Additional sentence proposals included imprisonment of between six months to a year \\"in one of the lower prisons\\" and exile from Venice and the Veneto for five years. These proposals were rejected by the Senate. Eventually the sentence was reduced after the Tenedos controversy had subsided. His sentence was reduced \\"as too severe for a man who has committed his life to the service of the Signoria, with exemplary loyalty\\". On 8 March 1392 Barbo was sent to Constantinople as Venetian ambassador during John V Palaiologos's funeral.

Named for one of her lyrics, is about her life in and around music. The book starts with her as a hyper-performative young nerd who runs for vice president of her Washington State elementary school. The story goes on to cover Brownstein's escape from a turbulent family life into a world where music was the means toward self-invention, community, and rescue. Along the way, Brownstein chronicles the excitement and contradictions within the era‚Äôs flourishing and fiercely independent music subculture, including experiences that sowed the seeds for the observational satire of the popular television series Portlandia years later. Publication history Brownstein published the 256-page memoir with Riverhead, an imprint of Penguin Group, on October 27, 2015. Reception The book received largely positive reviews. In The Guardian, Michelle Dean compared Brownstein's writing to her band Sleater-Kinney's \\"intensity\\", saying \\"Brownstein‚Äôs book has a similarly fierce approach,\\" and felt that even if \\"there are certainly places where an editor could and should have chiseled her prose down to make her points sharper and more affecting, this book is the clear product of a very intelligent person, and filled with flashes of insight and wit.\\" On the other hand, in The New York Times, John Williams contrasted the tone of Hunger with Brownstein's work in Sleater-Kinney, saying \\"readers who have...thrilled to Ms. Brownstein‚Äôs supremely confident antics onstage...may be disappointed by this memoir‚Äôs nearly incessant tone of self-deprecation...But Ms. Brownstein is interested in telling us who she is ‚Äî and how she sees herself ‚Äî without a guitar in her hands. 'I was relieved that music had done exactly what I had always wanted it to do,' she writes in this both candid and evasive book, 'which was turn me into someone else.'\\" Television adaptation Brownstein was set to adapt her memoir into a half-hour television pilot, entitled Search and Destroy, for streaming service Hulu. She was set to write, direct, and executive produce alongside Megan Ellison, Sue Naegle, and Ali Krug. The pilot was being produced by Annapurna Pictures. On March 8, 2018, it was announced that Taylor Dearden and Aubrey Peeples had been cast in the show's lead roles. On May 18, 2018, it was reported that Brad Morris, Leah Harvey, Jessica Hecht, and Imogen Tear had joined the main cast. It was announced on February 11, 2019, that Hulu would not be going forward with the series.

The party was created in 1718 of those who favored Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein- Gottorp, son of Charles XII‚Äôs elder sister Hedvig Sophia of Sweden, as heir to the throne before that of Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden. The party lost to the followers of Ulrika Eleonora in 1719, and to her spouse and successor Frederick I of Sweden in 1720. But due to Frederick I‚Äôs plans to strengthen royal power with support of the Hovpartiet, the Holstein Party were given a favorable situation have Charles Frederick appointed heir to the throne, a situation which was supported by Tsar Peter the Great of Russia who wished influence in Sweden. In the Riksdag of 1723, the attempt of the king and Hovpartiet to introduce absolute power was crushed and the Holstein Party, whose follower filled the seats of parliament and bought more followers by granting allowances and titles from Holstein and Russia, especially to those losing their property during the Great Northern War: Charles Frederick was granted the title Royal Highness, a Swedish allowance and an informal promise to be considered as heir to the throne should such an election be necessary. The marriage of Charles Frederick to Anna of Russia and the accession of empress Catherine I of Russia in 1725 signified a triumph for the Holstein Party: the rumors that Charles Frederick was about to be appointed Russian heir to the throne or at least be granted the Baltic provinces made him an attractive heir to the Swedish throne by those in Sweden wishing to restore the Swedish Empire, and ambassador Josias Cederhielm was sent to Russia. These plans were however prevented by Arvid Horn with support of the king and the ambassadors of France and Great Britain to prevent Sweden from being involved in a war through Russia's promise to reconquer Slesvig to Holstein from Denmark. During the Riksdag of 1726-1727, Horn managed to have the Riksdag vote for Sweden to join the Treaty of Hanover (1725) against Russia, and the Holstein followers was removed from the royal council and replaced with the followers of Horn. The defeat of the Holstein Party was completed by the death of Catherine I, which destroyed the power base of Charles Frederick in Russia and forced him to leave for Holstein.

The unit is also charged with providing general public duties support in the Military District of Washington and beyond. History and mission Diplomatic Reception Room. The Army Herald Trumpets is derived from the United States Army Band, founded in 1922. Following successful international tours during World War II, the band split into various sub-groups, including the Herald Trumpets. U.S. Army Herald Trumpets are designated as the \\"official fanfare ensemble for the President of the United States\\" and were activated in 1959 at the suggestion of Army Band coronetists William Bramwell Smith, Jr., and Gilbert Mitchell. Its first public performance was for the arrival of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth II at the official opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway and its first White House state arrival ceremony was during the 1960 state visit of Charles de Gaulle. In addition to state occasions, the unit has also performed at other important events, including the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971, the opening of the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, and the opening ceremonies of the 1980 Winter Olympic Games at Lake Placid, New York, the 1984 Summer Olympic Games at Los Angeles, California, the 1996 Summer Olympic Games at Atlanta, Georgia, and the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, Utah. The image on the unit's drums is known as \\"the Grand Republic\\" and was designed by Gus Moeller. The unit is most widely seen at state and official arrival ceremonies at the White House where it performs three times in the order of events: first, \\"Ruffles and Flourishes\\" and \\"Hail to the Chief\\" for the arrival of the President of the United States; second, \\"Call to Statesmanship\\" for the arrival of the visiting head of state or chief of government; third, \\"Presidential Processional\\" as the President of the United States returns to the White House. (The respective national anthems, and other music during the ceremony, are performed by one of the premier ensembles.) The unit is operationally part of the U.S. Army Band. It is not the only fanfare unit in the United States military. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command also fields a 15-man herald trumpet unit posted at Fort Eustis near Newport News, Virginia, while the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps of the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment has a five-man fanfare unit that performs on baroque trumpets. Uniform and equipment The Herald Trumpets use a combination of E-flat, B-flat mezzo-soprano, B-flat tenor, and bass herald trumpets custom-manufactured by Kanstul Musical Instruments. For defined ceremonies herald trumpets decorated by banner with coat of arms. Each trumpet is dressed with a ceremonial tabard emblazoned with the heraldic achievement of the U.S. Army Band. The unit's rope drums, as with those of the rest of the U.S. Army Band, are manufactured by the Cooperman Drum Company and are painted with an emblem known as \\"the Grand Republic,\\" which was designed by Gus Moeller. The drum heads are made of kevlar. Posted at Joint Base Myer‚ÄìHenderson Hall, the Herald Trumpets are a \\"Special Ceremonial Unit,\\" a U.S. Army designation for units that are authorized to wear uniforms other than the Army Service Uniform when executing public duties. The unit's winter ceremonial uniform consists of a blue blouse with choker collar. A warm- weather uniform substitutes a white blouse, while the cover is a red peaked hat that represents the red coats U.S. Army musicians historically wore on the field of battle to distinguish them from non-musicians.

It was released exclusively on CD through Melora Creager's website on April 10, 2015, and is unlikely to ever be released in digital format ‚Äì in response to Creager's websites, social media accounts and her own computer being hacked by an identity thief. Background and recording In 2012, Creager formed the five-piece narrative musical project Fa La La: the Bastardy of Shakespeare's Madrigals. Inspired by the Madrigal works of Elizabethan author Thomas Weelkes, the project expands on the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship ‚Äì the claim that Edward de Vere wrote the plays and poems traditionally attributed to William Shakespeare ‚Äì by alleging that Weelkes was another pseudonym used by de Vere, and that the music of Weelkes could be seen as scores to Shakespeare's plays. The fourteen songs found on the album were written and recorded by Creager over a three-week period in early 2015, and were performed by the singer alone in her \\"dank basement\\" recording studio using only one microphone ‚Äì a Neumann copy of a Soundelux E47. Inspiration and themes Lyrically, the album's central theme stems from Creager's experience of having her computer, website and social media accounts hacked by an identity thief. Disabling the singer's access to all of the band's online accounts, the hacker eventually rendered Creager's own computer corrupted to the point of her not being able to access anything on it, resulting in the loss of much of her life's work. She addresses this experience metaphorically on songs found throughout Unknown, which Creager has referred to as her \\"most personal album\\". Unable to use her computer to research specific historical situations or people ‚Äì an approach which she had used when composing much of the band's latter work ‚Äì she instead chose to write about her \\"own feelings, rather than taking from something that happened historically\\". She compared this approach to the one she employed when composing the band's first album, Thanks for the Ether (1996), saying \\"I used to write songs on paper just from my own thoughts as opposed to 'Google it! Google it! Google it!', I'm done with that kind of regurgitation\\". \\"Unicorn Horn Mounted\\" is a fable in which the incident is compared to a gamekeeper hunting the mythical creature for the purpose of removing its horn. As the hunter gloats in his trophy room, the unicorn laments being a \\"pathetic, broken down pony\\" with a \\"gory wound on [her] face\\", and is left distraught over the loss of her magic. \\"Sensed\\" tells the story of the last two humans in a post-apocalyptic world, who choose to interact with one another solely through technology. By refusing to ever establish physical contact, they willingly facilitate the extinction of the human race. On \\"Psychopathic Logic\\", Creager comments on the ordeal directly by describing the perpetrator as someone who is blind to real human interaction, living instead through a fantasy on a video screen. She goes on to describe the perpetrator as someone who has \\"no empathy\\" and who wants \\"to own the girl, to own her world\\". \\"Indian Weed\\" deals with the issue of online privacy. The album also contains moments of humor. \\"Emily Dickinson Trophy Letter\\" finds the eponymous poet and the Wizard of Oz fighting over the ownership of a bowl of pudding, with the argument eventually devolving into a masked wrestling match. \\"Pastoral Noir\\" finds the Roman goddess Vesta in search of her lover, a shepherd named Tony. After questioning several nymphs regarding Tony's whereabouts, she is led to the Greek deity Pan and is then seduced by his \\"instrument\\". \\"Bridget Manners\\" is in reference to Lady Bridget Manners, a lady-in-waiting for Elizabeth I of England, suggesting that it may have originated as part of the Fa La La project. Release and promotion The first new material released by Rasputina in 2015 was a ten-song collection entitled Good Day, Gentlefolk on March 21. Unknown was then released on April 10 on CD exclusively through Creager's website. The album is unlikely to ever be released in digital download format, with Creager explaining that \\"conceptually, this album doesn't exist on the internet. It is Unknown, but it is a real and physical thing and anyone who purchases it is Known to me\\". On May 12, she released the first part of the Fa La La collection, containing original music and rearranged versions of Renaissance-era material. She referred to the collection as one of \\"many more to come. It's an endlessly fascinating subject\\". On June 26, she released Magnetic Tape, an album of cassette-sourced Rasputina demos recorded between 1991 and 1997. A CD version of the Fa La La collection, limited to 10 copies, followed on July 11. Unknown was promoted by a thirty-three date tour of the U.S. beginning at The Parish in Austin, Texas on July 23 and ending at the House of Blues in New Orleans, Louisiana on Halloween. The live band featured Thanks for the Ether cellist Carpella Parvo and piano by Luis Mojica, as well as incorporating vocal beat-boxing by Mojica and looping pedals. Critical reception Due to the album's physical-only release, few online reviews have been published. Creager explained that \\"it's like a prank because it gives everyone a hard time ‚Äì like the press who say 'I need a download!', I'm like 'there just isn't one. You have to wait two weeks in the mail like everyone else'\\". In his review of the album, Falling James of LA Weekly referred to Creager's \\"real-life horror of losing much of her life's work to a particularly invasive and controlling stalker\\" and said that \\"her new songs might be disguised with typically cryptic titles [...], but an unsettling sense of dread and mystery unfolds with every dark rustle of those feverishly restless cellos\\". Meanwhile, Geoffrey Plant of Weekly Alibi said that \\"while [it] doesn't rock as hard as some of the previous Rasputina releases, the durable and more avant-garde Unknown is of the highest cello- rock quality\\". While lauding the band's 2007 release Oh Perilous World as being their \\"most essential\\" album, a writer for New York Music Daily said of Unknown, \\"this is a masterpiece in its own right ‚Äì and a strong contender for best release of 2015\\".

It premiered on Showtime on December 13, 2015.  Plot  Carrie (Claire Danes) and Saul (Mandy Patinkin) ask doctors to revive Quinn (Rupert Friend) to query him for information on the impending terrorist attack, but Quinn is unresponsive and goes into respiratory arrest. When Carrie is told that Quinn's bullet wound was expertly treated, she begins asking her contacts for information on an underground doctor in the area where Quinn went missing. Following a tip from Al-Amin, she tracks down Dr. Hussein, who brings Carrie to Qasim's (Alireza Baryam) apartment where the terrorist cell had been residing. In the apartment, Carrie finds extensive research on the Hauptbahnhof train station and heads there to investigate. Saul tries to coax information out of Faisal Marwan, who has been detained by the BND and subjected to harsh interrogations. Laura Sutton (Sarah Sokolovic) does a live television interview and demands that she be allowed to see Faisal immediately, or else she will release the remaining classified CIA documents in her possession; Saul is summoned away to watch the interview. He returns and finds that Faisal has jumped out of the window and killed himself. Allison (Miranda Otto) receives her final assignment from the SVR: she must ensure that the chemical attack on Berlin succeeds. When the CIA learns that Zaheer, slain member of the cell, was enrolled at TU Berlin, Allison volunteers to talk to professors she knows there. She is allowed to do so if accompanied by a CIA escort, Conrad Fuller (Morocco Omari). As directed by the SVR, Allison goes directly to mathematics professor Dr. Aziz (Rachid Sabitri). Allison aggressively questions Aziz, and asks for Conrad's gun in order to scare him, but kills Conrad with it instead. She threatens Dr. Aziz until he reveals the target of the chemical attack: the 5:15 train to Potsdam at the Hauptbahnhof. Allison then kills Dr. Aziz, and shoots herself in the shoulder, staging the scene as if Dr. Aziz incited a shootout. After phoning Astrid (Nina Hoss), she is promptly taken to a hospital. She lies to Astrid, saying she learned that Berlin Brandenburg Airport is the target. The BND begins coordinating a full evacuation there. Saul starts to question Allison as to what happened at the university but is interrupted when a doctor arrives to drain her wound. Bibi's team enters the train station.

In addition, Peterson considered the scene where Allison kills Conrad and Dr. Aziz as \\"one of the most vivid, riveting scenes in Homeland history\\".

Barberry  Biography  Born Ethel Phoebe Bailey on May 10, 1866 in Vassalboro, Maine to Mary E. Pearson and George L. Bailey, Higgins was educated at the Wesleyan Seminary and Female College (now Kents Hill School) in Readfield, Maine. In 1900, she moved to Los Angeles, California with her parents and worked as a photographer, first in the studio of Frank G. Shumacher, then setting up in her own studio, specializing in botanical subjects. In 1914, she married John C. Higgins; the next year, the couple moved to San Diego. During her career as a photographer, Higgins produced a series of 300 plant portraits, taking up the study of botany to properly identify her subjects. Higgins exhibited hand- tinted photographs of wild flowers during the 1915 Panama-California Exposition in Balboa Park. In 1931, Higgins authored Our Native Cacti; she joined the staff of the San Diego Natural History Museum in 1933, becoming curator of botany in 1943 upon the retirement of Frank Gander. Higgins compiled the first checklists of San Diego County plants, publishing ‚ÄúAnnotated Distributional List of the Ferns and Flowering Plants of San Diego County, California,‚Äù in 1949 and ‚ÄúType Localities of Vascular Plants in San Diego County, California‚Äù in 1959. Higgins's surveys have been updated, first in 1986 by R. Mitchel Beauchamp's A Flora of San Diego County, California and more recently by Jon P. Rebman and Michael G. Simpson's Checklist of the Vascular Plants of San Diego County (2014, 5th ed.), which includes new species and revised nomenclature. During the 1950s and early 1960s, Higgins participated in several of the museum's research expeditions, collecting plant specimens in Baja California and on islands in the Gulf of California. As associate curator (working with her successor as curator of botany, Reid Moran), she helped build the herbarium's specimen collection. She wrote a series of interpretative guides to southern Californian plants and trees and continued collecting specimens in Baja California, Mexico, into her mid-90s. Higgins died on March 9, 1963 in San Diego, California.

After wartime coal shortages during World War I, post-war reconstruction from 1919 focussed on electrification, powered by hydro electricity. In 1923 the PO began electrification of the 200 km section of the Toulouse main line from Paris to Vierzon using a supply of 1,500 V DC. The Ganz Works of Budapest, Hungary supplied these two locomotives, to the design of K√°lm√°n Kand√≥. The arrangement of the locomotives was unusual for DC locomotives and may have been influenced by Kand√≥'s other designs for AC locomotives, with the large diameter frame-mounted AC motors of the period. The four motors were mounted rigidly on the frames, above the driving wheels. Each motor drove an external jackshaft crank, with the four driving axles coupled in pairs. Drive between the motor jackshafts and the wheels was by coupling rods. As express passenger locomotives, this also permitted large diameter driving wheels, rather than small-wheeled bogies beneath the frames. Suspension travel between the driven wheels and the fixed motors was achieved through Kand√≥'s triangular linkage design. The coupled wheels, rather than individual traction motors, encouraged resistance to wheelslip. This advantage was recognised and influenced future French designs, such as the typically French monomotor bogie rather than the axle-hung traction motors used elsewhere. In service, the locomotives proved fast and powerful, but were unreliable. When other passenger locomotives became available, they were restricted to freight work at up to . Despite this they were popular with their crews, encouraged by the French practice of attaching crews to the same locomotive. They gained the class nickname, Les Belles Hongroisses. Their later years were spent in freight-only service based at Limoges. They survived into SNCF service in 1938, keeping their original numbers, but were withdrawn and scrapped that year.

Baseball career=College Stevenson played college baseball at Louisiana State University (LSU) from 2013 to 2015. After his sophomore season in 2014, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Yarmouth‚ÄìDennis Red Sox of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he batted .311 with 23 stolen bases in 53 games, was named to the 2014 All-League team, and helped lead the Red Sox to the league championship. At LSU, he was a teammate of shortstop Alex Bregman, the second overall pick in the 2015 draft by the Houston Astros. In both Stevenson and Bregman's final season of college ball, the LSU Tigers reached the 2015 College World Series. En route to the Tigers' World Series berth, Stevenson attracted media attention with an outstanding defensive play in center field. Playing behind starting pitcher Jared Poche, Stevenson leaped toward the warning track and laid out to take away a likely RBI extra-base hit from the University of North Carolina Wilmington's designated hitter. He then scrambled to his feet and threw from deep center field to the second baseman, doubling up the runner on base. The Times-Picayune, writing about the game, referred to Stevenson's play as \\"The Catch\\" and compared the LSU outfielder to American football wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., known for his athletic plays on the field. The Tigers ultimately were eliminated in the World Series by the TCU Horned Frogs. Professional2015= Stevenson was drafted by the Washington Nationals in the second round of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Nationals and made his professional debut that year with the Gulf Coast Nationals. He was later promoted to the Auburn Doubledays and Hagerstown Suns. In 55 games between the three teams, he batted .308/.363/.379 with one home run, 25 RBIs, and 23 stolen bases. =2016= Stevenson spent 2016 playing for the High-A Potomac Nationals and Class-AA Harrisburg Senators. In 133 combined games, he compiled a .276 batting average with three home runs, 34 RBIs, and 39 stolen bases. After the season, Stevenson was one of a handful of Nationals prospects to play in the Arizona Fall League. Playing for the Glendale Desert Dogs, he led the AFL in hits with 30 and posted a .353 batting average, second in the league, and was named along with Desert Dogs and Senators teammate Drew Ward to the 2016 AFL Top Prospects Team. After Lucas Giolito, Reynaldo Lopez and Dane Dunning were traded to the Chicago White Sox in December 2016, Stevenson ranked as the Nationals' fifth-best prospect, according to MLB.com. =2017= Stevenson received an invitation to major league camp in the 2017 season. He played well, impressing Nationals manager Dusty Baker, who remarked of the outfielder, \\"He's always ready. When I look down there, he's already looking at me.\\" Stevenson was reassigned to minor league camp on March 13. After beginning his season with Class-AA Harrisburg and hitting .316 in April, Stevenson was promoted to the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs. Stevenson struggled in the early going with Syracuse, hitting just .169 over his first 31 games before turning his game around. After amassing a .246 batting average overall as a Chief, Stevenson was promoted to the major leagues on July 23, 2017, after outfielders Chris Heisey and Ryan Raburn were placed on the disabled list and bereavement list, respectively. He made his major league debut the same day, pinch-hitting and coming in on a double switch in the sixth inning to play left field. On July 27, Stevenson notched his first major league hit, lining a pitch into right field off Hern√°n P√©rez of the Milwaukee Brewers ‚Äî a utility player pitching in the major leagues for the first time, with his team trailing by 13 runs in the bottom of the eighth inning ‚Äî for a single. The following month, on August 10, he made a diving catch down the left field line to take away an RBI and extra bases from Miami Marlins second baseman Dee Gordon with two outs in the top of the ninth, preserving a 3‚Äì2 lead in the game as Nationals closer Sean Doolittle locked down the save. On August 27, Stevenson recorded his first major league RBI with a go-ahead, bases-loaded walk against the New York Mets that gave the Nationals a 5-4 victory.https://twitter.com/MarkZuckerman/status/901993823537999872 On August 28, the Nationals optioned Stevenson back to Syracuse following the return of left fielder Jayson Werth from the disabled list. On September 7, the Nationals recalled Stevenson. He finished the regular season with the Nationals, having appeared in 37 games, batting .158 with an RBI and a stolen base. =2018= Stevenson began the 2018 season with the Class AAA Syracuse Chiefs, but the Nationals called him up to the major leagues on April 16.Janes, Chelsea, \\"Nationals‚Äô Brian Goodwin had to be convinced before going on the disabled list,\\" washingtonpost.com, April 16, 2018, 6:27 p.m. EDT.

He had training as an auto mechanic. He participated in search and destroy missions in Vietnam and became addicted to drugs while there.Bryan, John, \\"This Soldier Still at War\\", Harcourt Bruce Javanovich, 1975, . Return and VVAW When Remiro returned from service, he joined Vietnam Veterans Against the War and then the more radical Venceremos. He then became involved with the Black Cultural Association, an education program for convicts at the Vacaville psychiatric prison in California, and Peking House, a Maoist collective where he became best friends with fellow future SLA member Russell Little. He also became friendly with Willie Wolfe at this time and Angela Atwood.McLellan, Vin, \\"The Man and the Mystery behind the Sla Terror\\", People magazine, April 29, 1974 This group became founding members of the Symbionese Liberation Army along with Donald DeFreeze, Thero Wheeler, Mary Alice Siem, Nancy Ling Perry, Patricia Soltysik, Camilla Hall, and Bill and Emily Harris. Symbionese Liberation Army The SLA was formed some time after March 5, 1973, when Donald DeFreeze, escaped from Soledad Prison then sought shelter with his Black Cultural Association contacts at the Peking House. Concerned about surveillance at their high profile radical commune, the residents moved DeFreeze to a less well known house in Concord rented by Nancy Ling Perry and also occupied by Patricia Soltysik. DeFreeze, whom circumstances suggested was an informant setting up sting operations, offered guns, explosives, and related supplies for sale to radicals he came into contact with.Headley, L and Hoffman, W, Vegas P.I.: The Life and Times of America's Greatest Detective, Thunder's Mouth, 1993 The SLA founders gained possession of an arms cache, inferred to be supplied by DeFreeze, and were not arrested in the process. DeFreeze's sexual relationships with Perry and Soltysik, with whom he was sheltering, are at the center of theories as to why this informant with a honeypot became converted to a revolutionary fanatic.Davidson, Sara, Notes from the Land of the Cobra, The New York Times, June 2, 1974 The honeypot, intentional or not, that he encountered was more powerful than the honeypot he possessed. Remiro's knowledge of weaponry from his time in Vietnam was a key element in transforming the group of affiliated radicals into an armed force. He trained other members in target practice, as well as the use, maintenance and dismantling of weaponry. During that transformation the group was joined by Thero Wheeler, a former Black Panther who knew DeFreeze from the BCA in Vacaville, and whose escape from Vacaville was aided by associates of the group. Following a cross-country trip to receive medical care away from the glare of law enforcement scrutiny in the Bay Area, he returned to find the group fully committed to armed violence and preparing for action.Rieterman, T, \\"They thought he was a kidnaper\\", \\"The Free Lance Star\\" Jan 7, 1976 https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat;=19760107&id;=TuJNAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=XYsDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7366,650988&hl;=en Wheeler was not impressed with the blind charge towards gratuitous violence. Conflict soon erupted at the Concord house, where he was staying with his girlfriend Mary Alice Siem, with guns threateningly pointed at Siem on occasion by DeFreeze, Soltysik, and Perry, and Wheeler interceding on her behalf. A falling-out in which Wheeler called DeFreeze a \\"drunken fool\\" and DeFreeze made death threats against Wheeler and Siem was ths last straw. As they were leaving in early October, Wheeler and Siem were robbed of $600 at gunpoint by their ex-comrades. Wheeler moved to Houston, Texas under an assumed identity and Siem moved to Redding, California.\\"Woman quits SLA over death threat\\", The Pittsburgh Courier, May 4, 1974, page 3. Reported sightings of Wheeler around the time of the Hearst kidnapping led to speculation that he was still involved, and to the notion that he was one of those killed in the Los Angeles shootout and fire. With the internal opposition cleared out of the way, the SLA prepared for its first action, the assassination of Marcus Foster, which would result in the convictions of Remiro and Russell Little. Assassination of Marcus Foster The SLA selected Superintendent of Oakland Schools Marcus Foster and his deputy Robert Blackburn as their first assassination targets, denouncing them as \\"fascist\\" for supporting issuance of ID cards for Oakland students to keep non-student drug dealers off of campuses. Foster's proposal was actually a compromise offered in response to more intrusive proposals supported by more conservative players in Oakland city and school politics. The assassination was carried out on November 6, 1973, as Foster and Blackburn left an Oakland School Board meeting. Foster was killed by five cyanide-packed bullets and Blackburn was badly wounded by a shotgun blast. Although there were no eyewitnesses who could identify the assailants, circumstantial evidence discovered later implicated Joe Remiro and Russell Little. The killing of Oakland's first black school superintendent, who was popular among Oakland's minorities and liberals, did not sit well among the leftists that the SLA saw themselves as the vanguard of. ‚ÄúBlack folks have never been given enough power in this country to be No. 1 on anybody's hit list. Why Foster? Why not the head of Standard Oil of California, or Union Oil or Bank of America? By what standards do you kill one of the few black superintendents of schools in the country? You go down on East 14th Street in Oakland and explain it to the people, because the SLA hasn't bothered!‚Äù said Carolyn Craven, a black reporter with strong leftist sympathies. Speculation circulated through leftist publications that the previously unknown group who assassinated a popular liberal figure was actually a right-wing false flag operation. Arrest On January 10, 1974, Remiro and Russell Little were apprehended by police, as they were driving suspiciously in a quiet neighborhood in Concord, California at 1.30am in a battered van. Little showed the officer a fake license and claimed he was looking for the \\"Devoto\\" home. However, Little had been staying there for several weeks with Nancy Ling Perry, who had rented the house under the assumed name. When the officer then asked the passenger to identify himself, Remiro grabbed a holstered pistol. The officer took cover behind his car. When the officer peered out from cover, Remiro fired two rounds at the policeman, who fired two shots back at him. Remiro took cover and then emerged again, firing three more rounds at the officer, who again fired twice at Remiro. Although neither Remiro or the officer were hit, Little was wounded during the shootout. Remiro fled the scene as police arrested Little. Four hours later, Remiro surrendered only a block from the SLA hideout. Officers found the Walther automatic pistol that had been used in the murder of Marcus Foster. Since Little had mentioned the name Devoto, it was presumed by the SLA that it was only a matter of time before police would discover their hideout. That evening the house was doused with gasoline and sprinkled with gunpowder. Nancy Ling Perry was seen driving rapidly away. Detention As soon as Remiro and Little were booked into Concord City Jail, an extra shift of guards was called in to surround the building. No one got in or out without being thoroughly checked. The two were transferred almost immediately to Contra Costa County Jail, where armed guards on the roof were joined by extra street patrols. New and more serious charges were filed against the pair, bringing their bail to almost $750,000 each. Not wanting to allow any chance for escape or for an assisted breakout, it was decided that Remiro and Little would be transferred to California's most secure penitentiary, San Quentin prison. This move was unprecedented, as suspects are presumed innocent until proven guilty, and only the guilty are housed in penitentiaries.Burrough, Bryan, \\"Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence\\", Penguin, 2015 On Feb 17, 1974, Little and Remiro attempted to release a statement to the public with some of their grievances. This was seized by prison authorities but found its way to the media in March. Some grievances included that they were being held in isolation, \\"the hole\\" on Death Row, of being starved, and other claims of harassment, intimidation and violence. They claimed that this was under direction of the FBI.http://freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/DOC514_scans/514.SLA.RussLittle.JoeRomero.Statement.pdf\\"Aid for Miss Hearst Hinted by Prisoners\\", The New York Times, March 7, 1974 In late February 1974, Little's father, O. Jack Little, made a statement to the media and to other SLA members. He offered to take Patty Hearst's place as a kidnap victim. Part of his statement read: > If Russ Little and Joe Remiro are innocent in the Foster murder and are in > fact victims of a police state, then how in heaven's name can the kidnapping > and threatened execution of Patricia Hearst have any significance to Russ > and Joe but to sustain their indictment? ...

As supreme commander, he was able to defeat Xu Hai's () substantial raid in 1556 and capture the pirate lord Wang Zhi the next year through ruses. Despite his accomplishments, Hu Zongxian's reputation had been tarnished by his association with the clique of Yan Song and Zhao Wenhua, traditionally reviled figures in Ming historiography. He was rehabilitated decades after his death and was given the posthumous name Xiangmao () by the emperor in 1595. He is a direct ancestor of Hu Jintao, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and Chinese paramount leader from 2002 to 2012.Liu, Melinda. (2002, May 06). \\"The Man in Jiang's Shadow\\". Newsweek. Early life and career Hu Zongxian was born in the year 1512, in the Hu ancestral village of Longchuan () in Jixi County, part of Huizhou prefecture at the time. Today Longchuan is called Kengkou village (); Jixi is now part of Anhui province.Kengkou Village China.org.cn At the age of 23, he passed the provincial imperial examination and became a juren (). This was followed him passing the palace examination in 1538, becoming a jinshi () and paving the road to officialdom. Hu was first assigned to be the magistrate of Yidu in Shandong province, where his administration of justice won him the love of the people, who claimed that he brought rains during a drought and magpies to eat the locusts destroying the crops. He raised a thousand volunteer troops from miners out of work and sent them to the northern frontiers under the command of the Shandong grand coordinator Zeng Xian. For this Hu Zongxian was earmarked for promotion, but he had to retire due to the death of his mother in May 1542 to observe the three years-long period of mourning per Confucian rituals. Two years later, his father also died, and Hu Zongxian stayed at his home village for another three years. In 1547, Hu Zongxian reemerged as the magistrate of Yuyao of Zhejiang province. There he became known for his unconventional thinking such as when he solved the longstanding problem of illegal quarrying on Mt. Shenggui () north of the city by buying the mountain with his personal salary. His energetic governance was met with the people's approval and he became one of the few local officials to earn the praise of Zhu Wan, the grand coordinator of Zhejiang. In 1548, Hu's likeness was carved into the cliff of Mt. Shenggui in his honour. As investigating censor Hu Zongxian was summoned to the capital Beijing in 1548 and took up a position under the Censorate. In the six years as an investigating censor, Hu Zongxian distinguished himself by not only writing memorials to the throne evaluating the performance of provincial officials, but also participating in the actual administration of the provinces. During his tour of the Northern Metropolitan Region (Beizhili) from 1549 to 1551, Altan Khan broke through the defences at Gubeikou and pillaged the suburbs of Beijing. The defences of Xuanfu, where Hu Zongxian was stationed during the crisis, held fast, and Hu was able to send troops to relieve Beijing. He was rewarded for this and the emperor began to take note of his abilities. In the summer of 1551, Hu was transferred to Wuchang in the province of Huguang where he participated in the suppression of a Miao rebellion on the provincial border with Guizhou. There he gained firsthand knowledge of the Miao's fighting qualities such that he called for their service during the pirate suppression campaigns a few years later. He was recalled to serve in the Censorate headquarters in Beijing in 1552. There he made lasting connections with the political elite: the most important of which was that of Zhao Wenhua, and by extension that of Zhao's patron, the Senior Grand Secretary Yan Song, the official closest to the emperor. At this time the southeastern coast was under attack by the pirates known as the \\"wokou\\", who were a mix of Chinese merchants and foreign elements from Japan and Portugal violating the maritime prohibition laws. Hu Zongxian and Zhao Wenhua recommended a series of measures to counter this threat, including the expansion of the powers given to the grand coordinator, a position roughly equivalent to a provincial governor, so he could complete his task more freely. As a result of these suggestions, a new supreme commander position was created above the grand coordinators, overseeing the coastal provinces from Shandong to Guangdong. The Nanjing Minister of War Zhang Jing was assigned to this position in June 1554, and a few months later Zhao Wenhua and Hu Zongxian were sent south to scrutinize his actions. For over half a year Hu Zongxian could write nothing but reports of military failures and the serious loss of life fighting against the pirates, citing the government troops' poor discipline and leadership. Zhang Jing himself refused to cooperate with Zhao Wenhua, and Zhao Wenhua put his displeasure into writing by accusing Zhang Jing in a memorial of deliberately delaying the operation for his own profit. However, soon after Zhao Wenhua sent out the memorial, Zhang Jing defeated the pirates at the Battle of Wangjiangjing () on 10 May 1555, taking 1900 heads in what became the greatest Ming victory so far in the anti-wokou campaign. As it was too late to recant his earlier statement, Zhao Wenhua wrote another memorial to the throne downplaying Zhang Jing's victory while emphasizing Hu Zongxian's role leading up to Wangjiangjing, such as his ruse of placing poisoned shipments of wine on the pirates' path which killed up to 800 of their number. Zhao Wenhua also claimed that Hu Zongxian was present at the scene of battle in a suit of armour, even though he was actually at Hangzhou at the time. Hu Zongxian nevertheless went along with Zhao Wenhua and denounced Zhang Jing as well, adding that he had become arrogant after the victory. In the imperial court, Yan Song convinced the emperor that the victory proved that Zhang Jing had the capability to defeat the pirates and Zhao Wenhua was correct in his accusation that Zhang had been holding back, only striking when he heard about Zhao Wenhua's accusation against him. Infuriated, the emperor ordered Zhang Jing's arrest on June 5 and had him executed on November 12. Zhang Jing's replacement, Zhou Chong (), had his powers greatly limited compared to his predecessor. Instead of the 6 coastal provinces under Zhang Jing's command, Zhou Chong's was limited to only the Southern Metropolitan Region, Zhejiang, and Fujian. Hu Zongxian was meanwhile promoted to Grand Coordinator of Zhejiang, and was soon promoted even higher to supreme commander in April 1556, after Zhou Chong and his successor Yang Yi () were cashiered after less than a year in service due to their underwhelming performance. Presiding over the wokou affair=Defeating Xu Hai Map of the wokou raids in Hu Zongxian's time (blue), with sea routes from Japan Compared to the short appointments of his predecessors, Hu Zongxian remained in power until 1563. His longevity as supreme commander, and indeed his meteoric rise, were due in part to his association with Zhao Wenhua's clique. Zhao Wenhua was opposed to a strict enforcement of the maritime prohibitions like the ones carried out by Zhu Wan, and instead favoured opening trade as the means to solve the wokou problem. Hu Zongxian, in turn, carried out a policy of appeasement despite his subordinates' disapproval and the emperor's orders to capture the pirate lord Wang Zhi dead or alive. Even before he had become supreme commander, Hu Zongxian sent envoys to Japan in his capacity as grand coordinator ostensibly to request assistance from Japanese authorities, but in fact to establish contact with Wang Zhi to entice him to surrender. Drawn by the prospect of legal trade, Wang Zhi agreed to clean the shores of Zhejiang of pirates in return for a pardon. Wang Zhi also warned Hu that one of the pirate leaders in his consortium, Xu Hai, was on his way to raid Zhejiang again and Wang was not able to stop him in time. This was alarming news to Hu as it severely disrupted his plans of appeasement. To deal with the wokou threat, Hu assembled his own mufu, or private secretariat, enlisting the prominent figures of the region using his own connections since he was native to the area. In this way, he attracted talents such as the writer Mao Kun (), the artist Xu Wei, the ink maker Luo Longwen (), and the cartographer Zheng Ruoceng (), who helped to advise him in diplomacy and strategy. When Xu Hai came ashore and laid siege to the cities of Zhejiang along with his fellow Satsuma pirates Chen Dong () and Ye Ma (), Hu Zongxian and his mufu decided that they did not have the adequate numbers to decisively defeat the invaders, since the main Ming armies were in the northern frontier and Miao reinforcements were forthcoming. Instead, they manipulated Xu Hai with a generous offer of surrender. Throughout the course of the campaign, Hu Zongxian kept friendly contacts with Xu Hai, slowly turning him from his pirate allies by the use of bribes, deceptive promises of official status and ships to sail back to Japan, and false warnings of mutiny among Xu's ranks. He also made use of existing interpersonal feuds among Xu Hai, Chen Dong, and Ye Ma by sending Xu's mistress trinkets so she would badmouth Chen Dong and Ye Ma in front of Xu Hai. Xu Hai eventually turned both Chen and Ye in to the authorities, and Hu made further use of them by making them write letters to their followers explaining that Xu Hai was going to betray and kill them. Hu Zongxian handed Xu Hai a copy of the letters, making Xu Hai grateful and thinking that Hu Zongxian had his interests in mind. When Chen and Ye's former followers received the letters, they rose up against Xu Hai at the Shen Family Estate () in Pinghu. At this point, Hu Zongxian's government forces, including newly arrived Miao troops, entered the fray and killed indiscriminately. On September 29, the battle ended with up to 1600 marauders killed in the estate, and Xu Hai's body was found in a nearby stream. On October 10, Chen Dong, Ye Ma, and Xu Hai's brother were all executed in Jiaxing. Capturing Wang Zhi With Xu Hai's group put down, Hu Zongxian was given the post of grand coordinator of Zhejiang in February 1557, concurrent with his supreme commander position, but it was Zhao Wenhua who took much of the credit and rewards for the victory. However, in September 1557, Zhao Wenhua was accused of embezzlement, lost imperial favour, and died a commoner. Hu now had to cultivate direct relations with Yan Song, and he did so by introducing Luo Longwen, a dealer and connoisseur in antiques and other luxury goods, to Yan Song's son Yan Shifan (). Hu Zongxian turned his attention to Wang Zhi. On 17 October 1557, Wang Zhi arrived at Zhoushan Island with a large trading fleet. There he laid down his terms for surrender: he sought an imperial pardon, a naval commission, and that ports be open for trade; in return he offered to patrol the coast and persuade the raiders to return to the islands through force if necessary. Hu Zongxian now faced a dilemma: he could not let Wang Zhi go, but if he accepted Wang Zhi's surrender he might be forced to execute him (Zhao Wenhua's downfall made his policy of opening trade a political taboo), turning appeasement efforts to naught. In December, confident in his prospects and his invulnerability, Wang Zhi made landing at Hangzhou. There he was accorded respectable treatment by the authorities, who feared antagonizing his followers, while they figure out what to do with him. During this time Hu Zongxian asked Wang Zhi to help manufacture arquebuses for the Ming army, which led to the weapon being widely used in China. Finally in February next year, Wang Zhi was sent to prison, where he was given the luxuries of novelties, books, and healthy foods. Wang Zhi believed this was a temporary arrangement and remained hopeful for a pardon until 22 January 1560, when an imperial edict handed down the death sentence, and he was summarily beheaded. As pacification-minded officials had feared, Wang Zhi's followers gave up hope for peaceful trade and went back to their violent ways. Feeling betrayed after Wang Zhi was apprehended, Wang Zhi's godson Mao Haifeng made Zhoushan Island his base and launched raids on Zhejiang and Fujian. Hu Zongxian made a concerted effort to dislodge Mao from Zhoushan in March 1558, converging on the island from six directions with the generals Yu Dayou and Qi Jiguang, but failed and was forced to retreat. He tempered the rising criticism against him by blaming Yu and Qi, while sending Beijing a white deer, an auspicious Taoist symbol, to the emperor's great delight. The pirates eventually abandoned Zhoushan in December of the same year owing to the heavy military presence there, and scattered south to Fujian which became their new area of operation. In the summer of 1559, the remaining pirate bands in the Yangtze River Delta were wiped out. For his efforts, Hu was given the rank of Minister of War in June 1560 and the prestigious title of Junior Guardian () in October 1561. His supreme commandership was also extended to include the Jiangxi province since bandits were infesting the area, which lasted until November 1562. Shrines were erected in Hangzhou and his home district in his honour. Downfall and death Hu Zongxian had now reached the zenith of his career. In June 1562, his ally Yan Song fell out of imperial favour and finally lost his position as Senior Grand Secretary. In the following purge of Yan's associates, Hu Zongxian was impeached for being too friendly to Wang Zhi and mishandling military funds, among other perceived transgressions. An order for Hu Zongxian's arrest was made, and he arrived at the capital on January 19, 1563. The Jiajing Emperor, remembering Hu's substantial service and his auspicious gifts, interceded on his behalf and refuted claims that Hu Zongxian was part of Yan Song's clique, commenting that the recent attacks on Hu Zongxian were partisan. Hu was released and allowed to retire with all his titles intact, but his supreme commander position overseeing three provinces was considered too powerful, especially since the wokou had moved away from the crucial Jiangnan region, so the position was abolished after Hu Zongxian left office. Grand coordinators became the paramount figure in those provinces again. In April 1565, Yan Song's son Yan Shifan was executed along with Luo Longwen for treasonable offenses. Luo Longwen's estate was confiscated, and a search therein turned up a letter from Hu Zongxian asking Luo to present a bribe to Yan Shifan. Adding to this evidence of corruption, Hu Zongxian was also accused of providing shelter to Luo Longwen's son to help him escape the authorities. Hu Zongxian was thus brought from his home county of Jixi to Beijing to face trial in November 1565. While in prison, Hu submitted a memorial asking for clemency due to his past service, but it was soon discovered that Hu had died, supposedly from suicide by poison. The emperor ordered the case be closed after Hu's death. When Hu Zongxian's son tried to transport his father's body back to their home village, the local populace sixty miles north of Jixi threatened the entourage, forcing the son to leave the coffin on the roadside. Due to the interference of officials sympathetic to Hu Zongxian, the coffin was moved to a temple and later transferred back to Jixi for interment. Despite the people's hostility at the time of his death, Hu Zongxian's name was rehabilitated over the following decades. In 1569 the people of Hangzhou built a new shrine in his memory, and his original titles and ranks were restored posthumously by imperial order in 1572. In 1589, on the appeal of Hu's grandson, Hu's achievements were recounted and he was accorded a state reburial. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98), Hu Zongxian's victory against the wokou was given new currency, and he was canonized with the posthumous name Xiangmao (), meaning \\"splendid assistance\\".

Plot Med student Ralph Sawyer operates on Diana Wayne, victim of a vehicular accident, saving her life. Later, Sawyer opens a medical practice with buddies Frank Blake and Peter Piper. Even though Sawyer woos Diana, she falls for Blake. Blake purchases some much-needed medical supplies on the black market from scarred gangster Joe Grant and his bodyguard, Barney Millen. When Millen is shot during a shake-down attempt, Blake cares for him. Millen is arrested and Blake defends him at trial, claiming he fixed an acid burn and not a gunshot wound. Sawyer, who has a side job working for the medical examiner's office, discovers that most of his clients are thugs sent to the doctor's office by Joe Grant. He realizes that Blake lied in court. Grant murders the shake-down victim, who tells the cops before he dies that a \\"man with a scar on his face\\" shot him. Grant forces Blake to remove Grant's facial scar or get exposed as a gangland doctor. Blake does so, but takes photos of the operation that documents what he's done. Diana walks in as the surgery is ending, and realizes her beau is in league with a criminal element. Grant goes on trial. Blake sends his photos to Sawyer, who is forced by a judge to admit that Blake was the source of the images. Blake, realizing his future is finished no matter what, testifies in court against Grant.

Early life Westbrook was born on September 14, 1937 in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED117691.pdf He also grew up in this area. His father was Sgt. Edward Cody Westbrook, who died in Germany while serving in World War II. His mother, Virginia Ruth Colston, was a housewife who held various jobs to raise their five children. Westbrook attended Chambersburg Primary and High schools, graduating with Honors in 1955. After graduation he and his elder brother, Cody, traveled from Pennsylvania to Richmond, California to live with their maternal grandmother. Colston attended Contra Costa College, in San Pablo, California where he excelled, particularly at languages, and was an honors student.http://www.forevermissed.com/colston-richard- westbrook/lifestory#lifestory He was selected to travel to Rome, Italy to represent Contra Costa College based on President Eisenhower's People to People Student Ambassador Program. Military and government contracting career In a somewhat unusual path of military service, Westbrook served in the Army, then Air Force. After an assignment in South Korea, he was assigned to Travis Air Force Base in California in 1960. Upon completion of military service he taught English at the International Christian University in Tokyo. While in Tokyo he was recruited for a civilian position with Pacific Architects and Engineers, a US government contractor, in South Vietnam. He stayed with PAE five years. When a journalist later asked why he went to Vietnam, Westbrook answered, \\"Money, why else? I was told by the American Embassy in Tokyo I could make $10,000 working in Vietnam. They said it pays to be black in Nam\\". PAE was a contractor for the Central Intelligence Agency's Phoenix Program, providing services including civilian cover for CIA operatives and constructing 44 Province Detention Centers. Westbrook later denied working for the CIA. In 1968 Westbrook returned to the United States, then began a stint working with the Los Angeles Police Department's Criminal Conspiracy Section and the State of California's Criminal Identification and Investigation Unit. During that time radical black militant organizations were a top target of those units, and that circumstantial evidence suggests that Westbrook could have begun a working relationship with Donald DeFreeze, an alleged informant for LAPD, that would carry over to their later contact through Westbrook's academic outreach to the Black Cultural Association, an organization of black prisoners at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville.Churchill, Ward & Vander Wall, Jim, Agents of Repression: The FBI's secret wars against the Black Panther Party, 2002 Academic career Westbrook enrolled in the Linguistics department at the University of California, Berkeley in September 1970. By this time, he had mastered several foreign languages ‚Äî Korean, Japanese, Italian, German, and French. He also studied Swahili at Berkeley with Bwana Kaaya, from Tanzania. He understood and had a working knowledge of Bakweri. He worked in the fields of minority education and literacy. He traveled to Paris on a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the Sorbonne while a student at Berkeley. In 1975, he completed his master's thesis on the dual linguistic heritage of African-Americans, or \\"Black English dialectology,\\"Davidson, Sara, Notes from the Land of the Cobra, The New York Times, June 2, 1974 focusing on the need of many African-American students to code-switch between the General American dialect and their own dialect of English, which has some roots in West African languages. He told a journalist, \\"It's a brand new field, my own field. I made it up\\". As a teaching assistant, he taught African-American Linguistics in Berkeley's Department of Afro-American Studies. He continued to teach the class after graduating. He established his own educational consulting company, Minority Consultants, located on San Pablo Avenue in Berkeley. Its services were to assist African immigrants and African Americans with resources, to educate mainstream society about how African Americans learn, and to assist immigrants in adjusting to American society. He was Dean of Students at Contra Costa College in San Pablo, California from 1978 until 1989. Student activism and prison outreach The Black Cultural Association was formed in 1968 at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville and became officially recognized by the prison system in 1971. At that time Westbrook became the group's \\"outside visitors coordinator\\" for educational outreach from students at Bay Area colleges and universities. It was reported that he was asked to work with this group (but unclear who asked). On Friday nights there were cultural meetings, which several hundred outsiders attended. They opened with a pan African flag and black power salutes. Meeting programs included speeches, poetry readings, plays and debates. The program attracted radical students who saw militant black nationalism as a force that could launch a revolution. Westbrook's purported prior relationship with the inmate Donald DeFreeze in Los Angeles has driven the contention that DeFreeze was recruited by Westbrook as an informant to keep tabs on black inmates with radical political sympathies, and on interactions with radical students in the outreach program. Willie Wolfe, Russell Little and Mary Alice Siem, who attended his African-American Linguistics class, joined the BCA outreach program.Ross, Colin A. The CIA Doctors: Human Rights Violations by American Psychiatrists, Manitou Communications, 2006 In 1972, DeFreeze invited that group to join his separate study group, Unisight. An inmate by the name of Thero Wheeler, a former Black Panther, was also in this group.McLellan, Vin, The Man and the Mystery Behind the Sla Terror, People, April 29, 1974 This group would coalesce in 1973 as founders of the Symbionese Liberation Army after Wheeler's and DeFreeze's escapes from prison. Westbrook was involved in student politics on campus. He was President of the Pan African Student Union at UC Berkeley for two consecutive terms. In 1979 he hosted a question-answer session with the author James Baldwin on campus.Youtube video of Westbrook hosting a talk by James Baldwin, UC Berkeley, 1979. Westbrook is seated on the left (Baldwin's right). A reference to the Jonestown mass killing in Part II dates the video to after 1978. His views on equity and justice often created controversy. Symbionese Liberation Army Questions about Westbrook's relationship to the Symbionese Liberation Army arise from his relationships with its key players including DeFreeze and participants in the BCA educational outreach project. Suspicion that the escape of DeFreeze was arranged to launch intelligence-gathering and sting operations against Bay Area radicals was heightened by favorable treatment received by DeFreeze while at Vacaville and Soledad prisons, including the circumstances leading to his escape, and his behavior between his escape and founding of the SLA. Upon meeting radicals after his escape, DeFreeze was known for his eagerness to sell firearms, explosives, and related items, raising suspicions that he was trying to set up sting operations. His means of acquiring weaponry has remained unexplained (it was theorized that the weapons cache was provided by law enforcement handlers).Headley, L and Hoffman, W, Vegas P.I.: The Life and Times of America's Greatest Detective, Thunder's Mouth, 1993 None of this logically leads to Westbrook supervising or foreseeing his BCA/educational outreach contacts' role in founding the SLA, however, it does allow the possibility that he had a role facilitating undercover operations with DeFreeze, in line with his purported earlier role facilitating LAPD undercover operations against black radicals. After the kidnapping of Patty Hearst, the SLA placed Westbrook on their death list, claiming he was a CIA agent,Kifner, John, Cinque: A Dropout Who Has Been in Constant Trouble; School Dropout On Welfare Wanted to Sell Bombs Recommendation Ignored Cooperation Indicated Charges Dropped The New York Times, 17 May 1974 and had worked as a \\"torturer\\" for the CIA in Vietnam, marked as \\"an enemy to be shot on sight\\". They also claimed he was an FBI informer.SLA targets three for death,The Bakersfield Californian, April 5, 1974 Westbrook soon went into hiding, in fear for his life. Westbrook contended that he had fallen on the bad side of the SLA's founders because \\"lesbians\\" among them objected to his approval of miniskirt-clad black women attending BCA events, and bringing provocative images of women for BCA- affiliated inmates, \\"Because if you want to dangle a carrot in front of the inmates to get 'em to learn and come to meetings, you don't dangle Communism. You dangle fine‚Äêlooking chicks they'll think maybe they can get next to.\\" BCA founder David Inua described DeFreeze as unintelligent, lacking leadership ability, and incapable of formulating the SLA communiques presented with his voice. In his opinion Nancy Ling Perry and Patricia \\"Mizmoon\\" Soltysik, two gung-ho radicals enthralled with violent revolution and with whom DeFreeze was involved in sexual relationships, were the driving force behind forming the SLA. Comments on the adulation of black prisoners as revolutionary fantasy objects by white female radicals, and the ego boost that provided, were made by \\"Popeye\\" Jackson, a former inmate and prisoners' rights advocate. These perspectives suggest that DeFreeze's behavior aligned with Westbrook's theory that sexual politics was a more prevalent motivation than ideology for inmates who embraced politics within the BCA, to wit: DeFreeze wanted to impress the fanatical ladies for whom he was a revolutionary fantasy object. Not long after the SLA's denunciation of Westbrook, two of the families of SLA members, including Willie Wolfe's father, contracted top notch private investigator Lake Headley in an attempt to shed some more light on the matter.Langley, W, Patty Hearst - urban guerrilla brought to heel, The Telegraph, 17 Feb, 2008 On May 4, 1974, Headley, along with freelance writer Donald Freed, held a press conference in San Francisco. They presented 400 pages of documentation of their findings, some of which included: * A year before the kidnapping Patty Hearst had visited black convict, Donald DeFreeze, who later became the SLA's figurehead. * DeFreeze's arrest records and disposition of cases indicating unusually lenient treatment starting in 1967, when he informed on an accomplice in possession of nearly 200 stolen weapons. The detective on the case moved to a new unit focused on black dissidents. * The work of Westbrook with Los Angeles Police Department's CCS (Criminal Conspiracy Section) and the State of California's Sacramento-based CII (Criminal Identification and Investigation) unit, during the time DeFreeze was inferred to be an informant.Churchill, Ward & Vander Wall, Jim, Agents of Repression: The FBI's secret wars against the Black Panther Party, 2002 On May 17, 1974, The New York Times ran the story of DeFreeze and the Los Angeles Police Department. However, the story was largely overlooked due to this being the day of the shoot out and conflagration that killed DeFreeze and five other members of the SLA. In the 1993 book Vegas P.I.: The Life and Times of America's Greatest Detective which he co-wrote with freelance writer William Hoffman,Vegas P.I.: The Life and Times of America's Greatest Detective Lake Headley also presented evidence that Donald DeFreeze was a police informant and an agent provocateur, and that the Black Cultural Association was used to monitor radicals among students and prison inmates. Theories that the SLA was conceived of as a disguised CIA hit squad gained currency in some leftist circles, and were expounded upon in satiricalBrussell, Mae http://www.maebrussell.com/Mae%20Brussell%20Articles/Why%20Was%20Hearst%20Kidnapped%201.html and men's entertainment/storytellingRussell, Dick, Who Ran the SLA?, Argosy, Ann Arbor Sun, January 22, 1976, http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/200649 publications. In one telling, a number of inmates in California prisons were recruited with a combination of coercion and promises of favored treatment, and later withdrew their consent and faced consequences. Reportedly, DeFreeze was recruited and anointed as Field Marshall Cinque while still in Soledad Prison, and left prison to do the government's bidding. The main target of the SLA hit squad was the Black Panther Party, with Oakland School Superintendent Marcus Foster selected as a target by government forces because of his friendly relationship with the Black Panthers in Oakland. Joe Remiro and Russell Little compromised security after the assassination of Foster and were planned to be executed by SLA recruits in prison. The Kidnapping of Patty Hearst was a decoy action to provide cover for the SLA hit squad before planned actions against the Black Panthers. As a capstone to this elaborate and far-reaching theory, the Los Angeles shootout in which six SLA members were killed was a planned elimination of the hit squad to silence them after security of the hit squad had been unacceptably compromised. Personal life Westbrook married Eposi Mary Ngomba, whom he met on a visit to Cameroon. They had four children and lived in California. Death Westbrook died of cancer at Kaiser Oakland Medical Center on August 3, 1989. He was 51.

Later in May 2008, he was selected as the Physics Analysis Coordinator of the STAR Experiment, with the responsibility to formulate the physics goals of the experiment, regulate and lead the publication of papers, maintenance of database, information and data records etc. From 2011 to 2014, he was the Deputy Spokesperson STAR Experiment, and was involved in taking all scientific and administrative decisions regarding function of the collaboration. He was the co-founder of the Beam Energy Scan Program at RHIC to study the QCD Phase Diagram. From 2012 onward, he has been the Council Member of STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, USA. From 2013 onward, he has been the Collaboration Board Member of ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider Facility, CERN. From 2014, he has been the Editorial Board Member of ALICE at LHC, CERN. He joined NISER in 2012 as an Associate Professor and is the currently Professor, Chairperson of School of Physical Sciences, and Dean Faculty Affairs, NISER.  Research  Dr. Mohanty has contributed to the establishment of the quark-hadron transition and first direct comparison between experimental high energy heavy-ion collisions data and QCD calculations. and \\"Physics World\\" considered it among the 10 best in the year 2011.http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/dec/16/physics-world- reveals-its-top-10-breakthroughs-for-2011 His work in the STAR experiment has led to an exciting possibility of the existence of a critical point in the phase diagram of QCD. One of this work established the observable for the critical point search in the experiment. This is considered as a landmark work in the field. He has very successfully led the beam energy scan physics program in this direction to publish important scientific papers in Physical Review Letters related to the QCD Critical Point. He was instrumental in pushing for such a program at Quark Matter 2009. Then demonstrated the readiness of the STAR detector and the Collider to undertake the proposed QCD critical point search and the exploration of the QCD phase diagram at RHIC. He has made significant contribution to the discovery of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) in the laboratory. This state of matter existed in the first few microsecond old Universe. In such matter, quarks and gluons are de-confined and move freely in volumes much larger than nucleonic scales. In order to achieve such matter in the laboratory, temperatures of the order of 1012 kelvins need to be created. The quark-gluon plasma allows for studying transport properties like viscosity, thermal conductivity, opacity and diffusion co-efficient of QCD matter. Dr. Mohanty has several significant papers on signatures that experimentally confirm the existence of QGP, related to observation of strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions, jet quenching effect, and partonic collectivity. Dr. Mohanty as the physics analysis coordinator of the STAR experiment led a team that discovered the heaviest known anti-matter nuclei the anti-alpha (consisting of two anti- protons and two anti-neutrons) in the laboratory. This measurement provided the probability of production of anti-helium through nuclear interactions, thereby providing the predominant baseline for measurements carried out in space. As the physics analysis leader led a team that discovered the heaviest strange anti-matter nuclei. Normal nuclei are formed only of protons and neutrons. Hyper-nuclei are made up of proton, neutron and a hyperon. The anti- hypertrion, nuclei consists of anti-proton, anti-neutron and anti-lambda (a strange hadron). It has implications for neutron stars and also understanding of the nuclear force. To study nuclei, scientists arrange the various nuclides into a two-dimensional table of nuclides. On one axis is the number of neutrons N, and on the other is the number of protons Z. Because of the discovery of antihyperon it introduces a third axis (strangeness) and the table has become three-dimensional. J. D. Bjorken, Frank Wilczek and collaborators have advocated the existence of Disoriented Chiral Condensates (DCC) due to chiral phase transitions in QCD matter. The possibility of producing quark-gluon plasma in high energy collisions is an exciting one, from the point of view of observing the chiral phase transition as the hot plasma expands and cools. As the system returns to its normal phase it is possible for regions of misaligned vacuum to be produced. These domains, which are analogous to misaligned domains of a ferromagnet have been named Disoriented Chiral Condensates (DCCs). DCC's are regions where the chiral field is partially aligned in an isospin direction. These domains relax back to ground state configuration by emitting pions of particular species. Towards this goal and since neutral pion readily decays to photons, Dr. Mohanty has put in several years of dedicated efforts from his side to establish the photon production in heavy-ion collisions using a detector built in India and search for the signature of the chiral phase transition (through DCC). He is the lead author of the Physical Review Letters paper on inclusive photon production in heavy-ion collisions using the Indian detector. His contribution to photon production and to the physics of DCC in heavy-ion collisions led to the invitation from the editorial board of Physics Reports to write a review article, at the young age of 30 years.

From 1937 to 1969, the NCAA determined its national total offense individual title based on total yardage. Starting in 1970, the NCAA began making that determination based on total offense yards per game.

Allen was the uncle of President Grover Cleveland and is credited with introducing Cleveland to the practice of law and politics, therefore paving the way for his eventual presidency. Early life Lewis Falley Allen was born on January 1, 1800 in Westfield, Massachusetts, the son of Samuel Allen (1777-1855) and Ruth Falley (1776-1826). His grandfather was Captain Richard Falley (1740-1808), partially of French Huguenot descent, who was an American soldier who fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill, built a musket armory at Mt. Tekoa, and was the armorer to the 18th Mass. regiment. Samuel Allen, the youngest of 11 children, was not a farmer, like his father, but went into the mercantile business. Allen received most of his formal education at the academy in his hometown, finishing in December 1812. When he was 13 years old, he went to New York City and began working for a wholesale importing and jobbing dry goods house as an apprentice. After that summer, he returned to work with his father, who had moved his mercantile business from New York to Connecticut where he manufactured woolen goods. Career=Early career Residence of Gen. Peter B. Porter, overlooking the Niagara River, built 1816 and acquired in 1836 by Allen (demolished in 1911).In 1818, Allen moved to Sandusky, Ohio to work for his uncle, who was one of the largest landowners in the area. After three and a half years, Allen returned to New England, where he again worked for his fathers along with his younger brothers. In 1826, they sold the business and all moved to New York again. In early April 1827, Allen came to Buffalo to serve as secretary and financial manager of the Western Ensurance Company, which was chartered by the New York State Legislature in New York City. At the time, the insurance industry was small and Buffalo was unpaved with no sidewalks and a population under 3,000. Within the next three years, the Western Insurance Company's charter expired, and Allen, along with other local businessmen, obtained a new charter for \\"The Buffalo Fire and Marine Insurance Company.\\" In 1829, he bought a farm lot of 29 acres extending from Main Street to the \\"State Reservation line\\" of Black Rock for $2,500 (). He purchased several other plots of land through auction which were later sold for significant increases in value as old wooden structures were torn and new brick buildings were constructed along with the growing city. About 1831, Allen was appointed the financial agent of the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company, which authorized him to make loans on their behalf in Erie County, New York. He held this position until 1833 and he made loans of $200,000 () in the then village of Buffalo. He made additional loans of $100,000 () outside of the city to farms, all of which were repaid in full with no defaults. By 1884, the population of Buffalo had grown from near 3,000 in 1827 to 200,000. Grand Island In 1833, along with some Boston investors, Allen purchased 16,000 acres of forested land on Grand Island, New York at a cost of around $6/acre. This was practically the entire Island, save 1,700 acres. He subdivided his interests (800 acres), including the establishment of the Falconwood Club, and kept several hundred acres at the head of Grand Island, which he cleared for his own farming purposes. When he did sell his acres to the \\"Grand Island Park Company,\\" the acres were worth $200/acre. Politics In politics, he was an original Whig, and a pronounced Republican from the formation of the party. He was the first chairman of the first Republican convention in Erie County and was elected to the New York State Legislature in 1838 as a member of the 61st New York State Legislature. Personal life Grand Island built by Allen for his son William and his bride.300x300px In 1825, Allen married Margaret (Cleveland) Allen (1801-1880). Margaret was the daughter of William Cleveland, then a resident of Norwich, Connecticut. Her younger brother, the Rev. Richard F. Cleveland, a Presbyterian minister, was the father of Grover Cleveland. Together, Allen and Margaret had six children, only two of which reached maturity: *Margaret Gertrude (Allen) Bailey, who married Dr. Daniel A. Bailey of Buffalo. *William Cleveland Allen (1837-1913), who married May (Barclay) Allen (1844-1921) In 1837, Allen and his associates purchased the interests of Gen. Peter B. Porter at Black Rock when Porter abandoned Black Rock for a residence at Prospect Point in Niagara Falls. Allen bought General Porter's home overlooking the Niagara River and was home for the Allens for over 50 years. Porter had built the house in 1816 after his first home was burned during the War of 1812. It stood on present-day Niagara street near Ferry on the bluff high above the river, affording a fine view of the area. John Quincy Adams visited the Allens' home in Black Rock and for a while, Grover Cleveland lived there when Allen convinced Cleveland, on his way to Ohio, to remain in Buffalo to pursue a legal career which led to politics and eventually, the White House. In 1848, he was elected president of the New York State Agricultural Society. He was one of the original founders of the Buffalo Historical Society, as well as Forest Lawn Cemetery. Allen was also a proponent of trees on public streets. Allen, along with his wife and children, is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, New York. Legacy Present day \\"Allentown\\" in BuffaloAllen Street and Allentown in Buffalo are named after Allen. The Allen summer home on Grand Island, \\"River Lea\\" (c. 1849), a gracious Italianate built for Allen, is now part of Beaver Island State Park and home to the Grand Island Historical Society. Books Allen wrote many books including: *The American Short- Horn Herd Book (1846-1883), which registered the various short-horn cattles. He continued it through 1883 with 24 volumes that recorded 125,000 animals in its pages. *Rural Architecture: Being a Complete Description of Farm Houses, Cottages, and Out Buildings (1852), written during his correspondence with Andrew Jackson Downing.

This type of miraculous icon is known as acheiropoieta. The Lord of Miracles appeared in the 16th century in what is now Buga, Colombia. It has been housed since the 18th century in the Basilica of Our Lord of the Miracles in Buga, Valle del Cauca in the south west of Colombia. This minor Basilica is the most famous Catholic non-Marian sanctuary in the Americas. The Redemptorist monastic community that curates Our Lord of the Miracles also promotes the veneration of a reproduction of the Cretan icon of our Lady of Perpetual help. Apparition of the Lord of the Waters Image of the Christ of Miracles on the Main altar of the Basilica In September 1573, an indigenous woman, who made her living as a laundress, noticed a small but brilliant object that was carried by the current in the middle of the Guadalajara River. She caught it up and discovered that it was a tiny crucifix.De Klerk, Jacqueline. \\"Buga: Town caught in a spiral of time\\", The City Paper, April 20, 2018 Happy with her find, when she returned home, she fashioned an altar for the small crucifix using a common wooden box. According to tradition, one night the diminutive wooden crucifix began to grow into a life-size image of the Christ. News of this spread along all the Cauca River valley and many people started to gather at the place, where a hermitage was built, turning the woman's humble house into a sanctuary. A wealthy family from the region decided to donate lands to build a great church, the first Hermitage to venerate the holy crucifix on the site where it had first been discovered. The crucifix had already grown from the pocket size to nearly the height of a human person and was already called the Lord of Miracles. A great obstacle to facilitate the peregrination to the sanctuary was the fact that there was no bridge for the visiting worshippers to cross the river. According to the accounts dating from this period, after some collective acts of prayer during the rainy season, a natural phenomenon took place which resolved the problem caused by the lack of a bridge. During some strong rains the river suddenly and spontaneously diverted from its original path. It began flowing in such a way that a new river bed was formed that was many meters away from the old one. From this moment on, the Hermitage was located on the same side of the river as the city of Buga. History thumbnail For the first fifty years of the veneration of the Lord of Miracles, the image was kept in a small hermitage aside the river in the place it was originally found by the elderly laundress. It suffered a gradual darkening that was attributed to the smog of candles used to enlighten the place. Also the cross was deteriorated since many people had broken off bits of the crucifix as personal mementos. By 1605 a special inspector of the Roman Catholic Church was sent by the Bishop of Popayan, who was worried about the popular stories concerning the miraculously appeared Christ. He feared an accusation of schism by the Holy inquisition, and using the excuse that he found the quality of the image so degraded by the handling of the pilgrims who had broken off piece, so he decided to burn it. There was a special attempt to destroy the crucifix by a great fire. But the crucifix didn't burn. Instead it transpired a lot of oily liquid which the devotees wiped up with small pieces of cotton. The pieces of cotton which had touched the image while it was in the fire reportedly produced many miraculous cures when they were used to touch ill people of the region. This led to more fame for the sanctuary. As a consequence of the attempt to burn the image, the skin of Christ turned from light olive color to a darker one that it currently has. In September‚ÄìOctober 1757 the Bishop of Popay√°n, Diego del Corro, visited Guadalajara de Buga, to witness personally the existence of the image, and decided to collect all documents concerning it so as to prepare a case to be sent to Lima, Peru, the official site of the Inquisition tribunal. From the 1700s to the 1900s, three different hermitages were built at the site. Since this is the most seismically active region of western Colombia, they were all damaged by earthquakes.Ram√≠rez, Jes√∫s Emilio. \\"Actualizaci√≥n de la historia de los terremotos en Colombia\\", Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Facultad de Ingenier√≠a, Instituto Geof√≠sico Universidad Javeriana, 1 January 2004. By 1875, the temple had experienced so much damage that the Bishop of Popayan brought in the Redemptorist friars as caretakers. Basilica thumbnail Shortly thereafter, many donations from devotees were collected towards the construction of the Basilica. Four million brickets were manufactured in the city and twelve thousand arrobas of calcium used to paste them to build the walls. The work was carried out by volunteers from all over the region under the supervision of the priests. The formal inauguration of the temple took place on 2 August 1907 with a solemn blessing ceremony in the presence of the Apostolic Nuncio, representing the Holy See, Monse√±or Ragonesi and the new Archbishop of Popay√°n, Monse√±or Antonio Arboleda, together with thousands of devotees from all over the country. On 29 April 1937, a man tried to destroy the image with a machete. The image was not destroyed but the attack opened a gap in the right side of the torso, showing that it was not carved in wood as many believed but in some kind of mud. On Sunday, 4 March 1956, a priest celebrating the Mass suffered an assassination attempt, but the dagger used by the attacker fractured in the air in three pieces in the presence of many witnesses, a fact that received a lot of coverage of the press. The three pieces of the weapon are still permanently exhibited in the museum of the Basilica. On 3 February 1969, another person attacked the image causing some damage to it, so an artisan was called to repair it and it was he who confirmed that the Christ is not carved but made of mud and grass similar to that on the shores of the Guadalajara river. At present the Christ, is protected behind bulletproof glass. Unknown identity of the finder and First printed accounts A witness mentioned in ecclesiastic documents of that time of the miracle of the fire in 1605, when the Bishop of Popayan ordered the destruction of the image, there had been a lady named Luisa Sanchez. This could refer to the washing woman who had originally found the crucifix or possibly to one of her surviving relatives. thumbnail A testimony given to one Inquisition Visitador (inspector), in 1665, corresponds to Do√±a Luisa de la Espada, a daughter of one of the Buga Patriarchs that donated the money to build the first Hermitage. According to her sworn statement as recorded in the archives, she swore she had seen the crucifix placed in the fire but not burning, only transpiring an oily liquid. During the 16th and the 17th centuries the image was known among the common people of the Cauca's Valley as The Lord of the waters, but the increasing fame of the miracles obtained by its devotion changed to The Lord of Miracles. Basilica del Senor de los Milagros de Guadalajara de Buga Among the first printed official accounts is the full story of the Miracle of the Guadalajara river written by Franciscan Friar Francisco G. Rodr√≠guez in 1819, the same year Colombia became independent from Spain. There are records showing that General Simon Bolivar visited Buga among the places he traveled across in his independence campaign for the south west of the country after the battle of Boyac√° in his route to Equator. This unique Christ, modeled from materials of the western Colombian Andes receives its name from the region of Buga. During the colonial times the region was populated by the aborigines called Bugas, who were violently suppressed by the Spaniards when they arrived in that region in the early 16th century. thumbnail In 1783 the rector of the Popayan seminar, and also the director of the sanctuary of Buga, with the approval of the Bishop, sent a report to Rome containing an extensive list of miracles of the healings received by the devotees. Pope P√≠us VI responded to this communication with 22 ‚Äúbreves perpetuos‚Äù, special instructions in which he granted generous indulgences to all the pilgrims that attended the sanctuary. The copy of this Pontifical document is filed in the Archives of the Basilica. thumbnail The image as artifact=Iconographic description The image is a full-length representation of a copper coloured skinned Christ, a long haired young man with high cheek-bones and cleft chin covered by curled beard. His features are visibly altered by the torture suffered in the agony of the Passion, and dreadlocks simply parted in the middle framing his face. He is falling, hanged from the cross, with the hands and feet pierced by the strong nails. His head is slightly inclined. He has a suffering but at the same time very serene expression in his eyes. This Christ image didn't really have a crown of thorns already modeled on it, so the devotees added a diadem, made of plants of the Andes, to the head, but without thorns, and fixed the rays of gold with precious gems on it. Apparently the figure is naked, but it has been dressed along the centuries with fine embroidered cloths that are periodically changed and cover the upper legs and belly. His head has been partially covered by a diadem of plants used to make baskets or hampers in the Andean artistry and decorated with fine rays in gold and with precious stones that were donated by the devotees in gratitude for the miracles attributed to Christ in their prayer to Our Lord of Miracles. Its entire cross is framed by waiving flames made of silver and platinum, possibly added in between the 17th or 18th century that may at the same time represent its divine nature or remembrance of the miracle of the fire, when the image was tested by being put in a bonfire by the orders of the inquisition inspector. The base of the cross has a garden of tropical flowers made of platinum, silver and gold, showing the image also as hanging from a tree of life. All these additions in noble metals follow a millennial custom to offer votive elements in thanksgiving to God for the miracles received. Physical description Although it has all the aspects of a wooden Colonial Christ, the figure has been discovered recently to be made actually as if modeled like a very fine ceramic, with porcelain quality, from a mixture of very fine highly plastic mud and grass that correspond to the plants found on the shores of the Guadalajara river until present. There are no precedents of this same quality of porcelain work in all the art craft of the Americas. It represents a singularity never repeated again either in the Pre-Hispanic or the Colonial religious art of not only Colombia but any other place in the entire Andean region of South America. The original color of the figure is of mysterious origin, since it resembles human skin, and it is possible that it was protected subsequently with layers of varnish for religious figures used in colonial times by artisans hired to either repair or protect the figure, although there are no records of such repairs in the church archives. thumbnail The Lord of Miracles of Guadalajara of Buga has at present the size of a short adult man (1.30 m, about 4.5 ft). It has a distinctive look that is not really European, due to the relative dark color of his skin, but definitively of a man of middle east, resembling a lot the depictions of Christ from the Holy Mandylion and Keramion, or the mount Sinai monastery: Technical analyses On 5 October 2006, a team of specialists used four different complementary technologies to analyze the artifact: X rays, ultraviolet rays, pigment, and stratigraphic analysis. The analyses of the image certified its incredibly well preserved condition after several centuries. thumbnail Religious significance The image of the Lord of Miracles of Buga has been used in religious processions and public acts of prayer for the Peace of Colombia, particularly during the grave narco- terrorist wave of violence that shocked Colombia during the second half of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. It has also been used in times of natural disasters, such as earthquakes in the Andes, or during strong floods caused by yearly tropical storms. [4]The Lord of the Miracles of Buga was sent on tour around to the principal cities of the country in 1993, including to the Capital Santa Fe de Bogota, as a special act of special consecration of the nation by the Roman Catholic Church that included several collective acts in which hundreds of thousands of believers were gathered to pray for the end to internal conflict. Our Lord of Miracles had been turned to by the Catholic Church as a powerful national icon invoking peace and reconciliation on multiple occasions in Colombian history, especially when calling for an end to internal national strife. An interesting parallel between the natural predisposition of the Christ of Buga to be hung out in public procession, due to its change of size and weight, and the climate of religiosity in the country. By the end of June 1902, Colombia was consecrated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus as a nation for the first time by Monsignor Bernardo Herrera-Restrepo in El Voto Nacional, which is the church, specially built for the event, in the presence of President Jose Mar√≠a Sanclemente a few months before the ending of The Thousand Days' War. In 1903, once the war was ended, the Lord of Miracles of Buga was taken outside of the basilica for the first time in years. The solemn act of consecration remained unaltered and was continuously practiced every year, with the presence of every single President of the country up until 1994, when it was derogated by the administration of Ernesto Samper-Pizano who was accused of having financed his political campaign with money from drugs lords. In the years following, outdoor processions in Buga were interrupted. This lasted until 2004 when Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church restored the solemn act of the consecration of Colombia to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Our Lord of Miracles of Buga was successfully exposed in solemn procession in 2007, as well as in 2014. Cultural significance=Symbol of Colombia The angular stone for the construction of the sanctuary was blessed by Ortiz, the Archbishop of Popay√°n. Also attending the religious ceremony was the President of the United States of Colombia, Rafael Nunez in 1886. The building of the church took more than 15 years, and was interrupted by the war of the thousand days in between 1900 and 1903, which is the worst civil war that ever occurred in Colombia. The inauguration on 2 August 1907 was dedicated by the authorities of the Department regional government and representatives of the national government as well as ecclesiastic authorities. The Solemn Benediction of the Basilica was carried out by the then Archbishop of Popay√°n, Msgr. Antonio Arboleda, on the Feast of St. Alphonsus Liguori, founder of the Redemptorist Order. thumbnail The minor Basilica is 33 meters in height, 80 meter long, and it had a French Clock installed on 18 March 1909. In between its two beautiful towers there is a statue of Christ Redemtor of 2 ¬Ω m of height, in melted iron. The five bells are imported from France. These are the biggest church bells in Colombia. The bell called the \\"Miracle Maker\\" weighs 1.111 kg; the bell called Perpetuo Socorro emits a note of FA in Bmin, weighting 778 kg, the bell called St Therese of the Jesus Child sounds a note of Sol, and weighs 548 kg. The smallest bell weighs 289 kg, and the biggest one (built in 1955), with three (3) tonnes. the Basilica covers a total area of about 2,088 sq meters. The Colombian film industry has found inspiration in the apparitions for some interesting productions, such as Strategy of the Snail, a 1993 film by Jorge Cabrera, in which Misia Triana (played by actress Delfina Guido) accidentally finds the silhouette of Virgin Mary in a wall of the house in dispute. Colombian Culture From an anthropological point of view, the image represents an interesting mixture of Christianity, introduced to South America by the Spaniards, and the cosmology characteristic of the Andean Cultures, whereby God communicates with the humans through rivers. For thousands of years streams or lakes were magical and mystical places of contact with the supernatural. The aborigines used great bodies of water as channels of communication with the great beyond, the world of the ancestors, and to pray to their divinities. In Andean Colombia there is a legend about the Golden Man, El Dorado, an Aborigine Chibcha King who every year navigated the volcanic Guatavita lake, located over three thousand meters above sea level on a raft, accompanied by his priests; th King was carrying incredible offerings of gold to the gods to be thrown in the water. The Chibchas believed that their entire civilization came from a woman and a baby that suddenly emerged from the waters of another Andean lake in its territory. Buga is currently located in the middle of the Cauca's valley, a region that was populated in ancient times, since at least 1000 years before Christ, by some of the most advanced prehispanic Colombian civilizations: Kalima, Quimbaya, Malagana, Katios, all among the best goldsmiths of the Americas. It was Sebastian de Benalcazar, a Lieutenant of Francisco Pizarro, who, in 1555, already confirmed as governor of Cauca Province, founded Guadalajara of Buga. Catholic Church Basilica of Guadalajara of Buga Vista Beliefs and miracles Roman Catholic sources claim many miraculous and supernatural properties for the image such as the fact that the figure has maintained its structural integrity over nearly 500 years, while wooden replicas normally last only some few decades before they start to suffer degradation. #The washer woman found a tiny crucifix that was the size of her hand in the Guadalajara river and then it grew up to the size of a boy of 10 years old in a night. That was the first miracle. #In 1605, the Christ figure was burnt in a fire for two days.

Guillermo Giraldo, a man who had been diagnosed as brain dead by physicians returned literally to life. His wife prayed to this Christ. #After three years praying the Novena to Our Lord of the Miracles of Buga, Marina Ben√≠tez became a mother. She had previously been diagnosed as sterile by physicians. #Jos√© Luna is a devotee who traveled from Mexico to Buga to give thanks to Our Lord of Miracles of Buga for the healing of his spine, after being bedridden for 4 years. Clerical approbation Several Pontiffs have granted recognitions to the venerated image, namely the following: * Pope Pius VI: In 1783, Pope P√≠us VI in response to a report of miracles occurred in the Sanctuary of Buga, with 22 ‚Äúbreves perpetuos‚Äù, gave special instructions granting generous indulgences to all the pilgrims that visit the sanctuary. The copy of this Pontifical document is filed in the Archives of the Basilica. * Pope Pius VIII: In 1819, the Roman Catholic Church officially approved the Novena of the Lord of Miracles of Buga, designed by the Franciscan Friar Francisco G. Rodr√≠guez, as a devotion offered by all that suffer disparate situations or try to defend impossible causes, in particular to overcome incurable diseases. * Pope Pius XI: On 23 June 1937, Pope P√≠us XI granted to the sanctuary the title of minor Basilica. This decree was applied by Cardinal Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (later Pope P√≠us XII). *Cardinal Primado of Colombia, Pedro Rubiano: On 2 August 2007 he presided the solemn Mass of celebration of the first 100 years of the Basilica of Our Lord of Miracles of Buga. thumbnail Devotions and veneration The annual festivities in honor of the Lord of Miracles of Buga (Colombia) in 2014 consisted of three special events that the Redemptorist friars, who have administrated the Basilica along all its existence, and the Pilgrims had celebrated: * First, the 130 years since the arrival of the Redemptorist Community to the city of Guadalajara de Buga * Second, the 75 years since it was received the title of Minor Basilica, granted to the shrine by the Holy See * Third, 25 years of service to the pilgrims and the social works of the ‚ÄúPilgrim House Foundation‚Äù\\"Feast of the Lord of Miracles of Buga -Valle ‚Äì Colombia\\", Scala News, October 24, 2014 These three reasons made the days of the Novena and the Feast Day (September 5‚Äì14) and the pilgrimage of thousands and thousands of pilgrims to the Shrine/Sanctuary a sight rarely seen before.

Signs and symptoms  Severe cases of CLA manifest in the neonatal period; milder cases caused by mtDNA mutations may not manifest until as late as early adulthood. Symptoms may be constant or brought on by an event causing stress, such as an asthma attack, seizure, or infection. Symptoms in the neonatal period include hypotonia, lethargy, vomiting, and tachypnea. As the disease progresses, it causes developmental delay, cognitive disabilities, abnormal development of the face and head, and organ failure.  Pathogenesis  Though lactic acidosis can be a complication of other congenital diseases, when it occurs in isolation it is typically caused by a mutation in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex genes. It has either an autosomal recessive or X-linked mode of inheritance. Congenital lactic acidosis can be caused by mutations on the X chromosome or in mitochondrial DNA.  Diagnosis  Congenital lactic acidosis can be suspected based on blood or cerebrospinal fluid tests showing high levels of lactate; the underlying genetic mutation can only be diagnosed with genetic testing.  Treatment  There is no proven treatment for congenital lactic acidosis. Treatments that are occasionally used or that are under investigation include the ketogenic diet and dichloroacetate. Other treatments aim to relieve symptoms ‚Äì for example, anticonvulsants may be used to relieve seizures.

Jharkhand was a ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù for Naxalites to experiment with their ideas of establishing a parallel government. As of 2005, 16 of the 22 districts in the state, including Hazaribagh district, was transformed into a ‚Äúguerrilla zone‚Äù. The movement was not restricted to armed operations but included kangaroo courts called Jan adalats, elected village bodies and people's police. Jharkhand, with a dense forest cover over a large part of the state, offers a favourable terrain for the Naxalites to build their bases and operate. Annual fatalities in Jharkhand were 117 in 2003 and 150 in 2004. In 2013 Jharkhand was considered one of the two states in the country most affected by Left wing extremism and Jharkhand police set up an exclusive cell to deal with Maoist activities. However, in the same year, when Jharkhand police identified 13 focus areas for combating Maoist extremism, Hazaribagh district was not one of them.

He was also an influential historian who wrote the history of Venice, a work which formed the basis of Marcantonio Sabellico's writings on the history of Venice. De Monacis combined early humanist ideas and his own experience as a diplomat during a time of expansion of the Venetian imperium and developed literary works which sought to give an ideological basis to Venetian expansionism. His works provided Venice with an ideological support base which justified the initial stages of the Venetian incursions into Italy and Dalmatia.  Diplomatic career  In 1386 Lorenzo de Monacis accompanied Venetian diplomat Pantaleone Barbo to Hungary representing Venice's interests during a crisis involving the succession to the Hungarian throne. The diplomatic mission was successful as described in a report by de Monacis to the Venetian government. During the mission, de Monacis wrote a poem defending Hungarian queens Mary and Elizabeth who were accused of the murder of Charles II of Hungary. In 1389, de Monacis accompanied Barbo again on another diplomatic mission to Hungary when they fell victims to robbery. The two diplomats, having lost all their personal belongings during the incident, received 60 gold ducats as compensation awarded to them by the Maggior Consiglio of Venice. De Monacis returned to Hungary on another mission in 1390. In November 1388 de Monacis was elected Grand Chancellor of Crete, one of the most prestigious offices in the Venetian realm. During that time he also supervised the agreement between Venice and Maria d'Enghien, inheritor of Argos-Nafplion, which saw the sale of the two cities to Venice for 500 ducats. In 1395, while still Chancellor of Crete, he was sent to France along with Giovanni Alberto, a fellow diplomat, to settle a trade dispute through diplomacy.  Written works  De Monacis wrote a variety of works such as histories, poems, diplomatic reports, and orations in Latin. The common thread of his works was the ideological position that Venice was a force for good and defender of freedom which protected its neighbours who gratefully accepted its dominion over them in exchange for the stability it provided them. His works formed the ideological background which justified the early stages of Venetian expansion into Italy and Dalmatia. His work Chronicon de rebus Venetis ab U.C. ad annum 1354..., ed. Fl. Corner (Venice, 1758), has been described as a \\"very valuable source for thirteenth-century prosopography\\", due to the fact that it contains original material from archives that de Monacis was able to access in Venice and Candia due to his position. As a historiographer, de Monacis has attempted to give a more balanced account of the sack of Constantinople by the Latins by using non-Venetian sources such as Nicetas Choniates; the Venetian sources had a heavy, anti-Byzantine bias.

The film acts as a sequel to David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It stars Claire Foy in the role of Lisbeth Salander and follows Salander as she battles against a mysterious notorious organization, the Spiders, who seek world dominance. Sverrir Gudnason, Lakeith Stanfield, Sylvia Hoeks, and Stephen Merchant also appear in the film. The Girl in the Spider's Web had its world premiere at the Rome Film Festival on October 24, 2018, and was theatrically released by Sony Pictures Releasing in Sweden on October 26, 2018, and in the United States on November 9, 2018. A box-office bomb, the film grossed $35.2 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, although Foy's performance was praised.  Plot  In Stockholm, Sweden, computer programmer Frans Balder hires vigilante hacker Lisbeth Salander to retrieve Firefall, a program he developed for the National Security Agency that can access the world's nuclear codes. Balder believes it too dangerous to exist. Lisbeth successfully retrieves Firefall from the NSA's servers, but she is unable to unlock it. Her actions attract the attention of NSA agent Edwin Needham. Mercenaries led by Jan Holtser steal the program from Lisbeth and attempt to kill her, though she survives. When she misses a scheduled rendezvous with Balder, he mistakenly believes Lisbeth has kept Firefall for herself and contacts Gabrielle Grane, the Deputy Director of the Swedish Security Service (S√ÑPO). Grane moves Balder and his young son, August, to a safe house. Meanwhile, Needham tracks the unauthorized login to Stockholm and arrives there seeking Lisbeth and Firefall. Lisbeth and her hacker friend, Plague, contact Lisbeth's former lover, investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, for help identifying her assailants. Blomkvist learns Holtser previously worked for Lisbeth's late father, crime lord Alexander Zalachenko, and is now affiliated with an elusive international crime syndicate known as \\"The Spiders\\". Lisbeth puts surveillance on Balder's safe house, and when it is attacked, she intervenes, attempting to protect Balder and his son. She is intercepted by Holtser, who kills Balder and frames Lisbeth, then kidnaps August. Lizbeth pursues them and rescues August. Lisbeth also learns the Spiders' leader is her sister, Camilla Salander, whom Lisbeth believed was dead. As children, Lisbeth escaped their abusive father, leaving Camilla behind after she hesitated to leave. After years of physical and sexual abuse, Camilla faked her suicide and went underground to form the Spiders. Lisbeth takes August to another safe house, where she confirms only he can unlock Firefall. Elsewhere, Needham locates Lisbeth's girlfriend, Sofia, and persuades her to arrange a meeting between them, intending to lure Lisbeth into a trap. Lisbeth evades him, and Needham is later arrested by Grane. Lisbeth helps him escape in exchange for him safely escorting August to San Francisco to reunite him with his mother; she begrudgingly agrees to later give him Firefall. The Spiders trick August by calling him from his father's cellphone, then track him to Lisbeth's safe house. Camilla and the Spiders take August to her base of operations, the sisters' childhood home. Grane had hired the Spiders to retrieve Firefall for her and informed them of Balder's location, but Camilla kills Grane instead. Using a tracker hidden on August, Lisbeth, Blomkvist, Plague, and Needham locate him. Lisbeth breaks in to give Plague remote computer access to the building's surveillance system. She is caught and taken to where August is being held. She learns that Blomkvist has also been captured. When Camilla threatens to torture him, Lisbeth tells August to trust her and to reveal the Firefall password. Camilla tries suffocating Lisbeth while describing their father's abuse. Armed with a .50 BMG sniper rifle and remotely guided by Plague via computer, Needham fires through brick walls, eliminating Camilla's henchmen, saving August and Blomkvist. Camilla escapes with the laptop containing Firefall, and Lisbeth pursues her. Holtser, injected with a poison that induces blindness, stumbles through some woods onto a road where he is fatally hit by Camilla's fleeing car. The vehicle crashes into the trees. Camilla, injured, escapes into the woods. Lisbeth pursues her to a nearby clifftop, where Camilla tearfully asks why she never returned for her; Lisbeth says Camilla chose to remain with their father rather than escape with her. Camilla, heavily bleeding, drops the laptop computer and steps off the cliff to her death before Lisbeth can stop her. Needham attempts to access Firefall only to discover Lisbeth has destroyed it. August is reunited with his mother in the United States. Blomkvist writes an investigative article about the Spider's Web to be published in Millennium, but then deletes it. Lisbeth destroys her childhood home as closure, then rides away on her motorcycle.

It carried Oregon Route 223 (OR 223) over Ritner Creek between Pedee and Kings Valley, about south of Dallas, or north of the junction with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Wren. Built in 1927, in 1976 the bridge was lifted from its foundation and relocated just downstream of its original site and replaced by a concrete bridge. The bridge was constructed in 1927 by Hamer and Curry Contractors to Oregon State Highway Commission plans. The initial construction cost was $6,964. The original portal design was rounded at the edges but was changed to a square design in the early 1960s to accommodate larger loads to pass.Ritner Creek Covered Bridge The bridge was named for pioneer Sebastian Ritner, who arrived in the area in 1845. In 1974 the bridge was declared structurally unsafe and scheduled for removal. Local residents started a petition to keep the bridge, which became a ballot measure in May 1974. The measure passed and it was moved, replaced by a new highway bridge. The bridge was the last of its kind to serve on a state highway in Oregon. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, following nomination by the State Historic Preservation Office due to the fact that while nearly 450 covered bridges existed in Oregon at the time of the bridge's construction, by the mid-1970s fewer than 60 were left in the state.

Its construction started in 1872 and opened on 7 July 1879. The prison has place for 600 inmates, but it had 1036 prisoners in 2017. History The construction of the new prison was decided after the Italian unification, together with other infrastructure improvement works in Milan in the period between the unification and the city's first town plan of 1889. Until then, prisoners were detained in several other structures not designed as prisons, among them the former Sant'Antonio Abate convent, in the Courthouse and in the former San Vittore convent. For the construction of the new structure the government acquired terrains in the outskirts of the city, in a sparsely developed area at that time. The building, designed by the engineer Francesco Lucca, takes inspiration from the 18th century Panopticon, with 6 wings with three floors each. The perimeter walls were originally built in medieval style, but they have almost all been rebuilt with modern standards for security reasons. Fascism occupation During Fascism occupation the San Vittore Prison was used as an house for every enemy (political or war enemy). Since Germans took over the power in Italy, in 1943, a lot of changes happened in the prison, until the big riots happened in the April of 1946. German occupation During the German occupation in World War II (1943 ‚Äì 1945) the prison was partly subject to German jurisdiction, with the SS in control of one of the wings. The prison gained notoriety during the war through the inhumane treatment of inmates by the SS guards and the torture carried out there. On 10 August 1944 15 captured partisans held at the prison, hand picked by Theo Saevecke, head of the Gestapo in Milan, were publicly executed at Piazzale Loreto and left on display, as a reprisal for a partisan attack on a German military convoy. The prisons served as a way station for Jews arrested in northern Italy, which would be brought to San Vittore Prison and, from there, to Milano Centrale railway station, from where they would be loaded into freight cars on a secret track underneath the station. On March 9 2020 inmates climbed onto the roofs and set fire to cells amid chaos in prisons sparked by the government new restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Chief Investigator was Professor Leon Lack. Originally from Stanford University, California, Lack moved to Flinders University in 1972. Lack went on to publish three more peer-reviewed research articles in 2003, 2004 and 2007 covering light therapy to treat sleep disorders including Delayed sleep phase disorder and Jet lag syndrome. These studies would further demonstrate the efficacy of green-blue light therapy for in improving sleep. Flinders filed patents in the United States, Japan, Korean, China and Europe to cover the specification of the light therapy prototype used in the 2001 study. In 2011 Flinders University signed a joint venture agreement with SMR Australia, a subsidiary of Samvardhana Motherson Group based in Noida, India with turnover USD $6.9billion. SMR Australia became a shareholder in Re-Timer Pty Ltd and also obtained the rights to design and manufacture the device. The Re-Timer product was launched in November 2012 and received significant global media coverage, which included the Wall Street Journal, CNN, BBC and Fox News. In the company's home state of South Australia, considerable attention has focused on the model of technology transfer used to commercialize this University research.

Jackson, Gary Oldman, and Salma Hayek. The film follows a bodyguard (Reynolds) who must protect a convicted hitman (Jackson), who's on his way to testify at the International Criminal Court. The Hitman's Bodyguard was released in the United States on August 18, 2017, and grossed $180 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews, with critics praising Reynolds and Jackson's performances and chemistry, as well as the action sequences but criticizing the clich√©d plot and execution. A sequel, The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, is currently scheduled to release on August 20, 2021.  Plot  Michael Bryce (Reynolds) lives a stylish life as an elite UK-based private bodyguard, until client Takashi Kurosawa is assassinated on his watch. Two years later, the disgraced Bryce ekes out a living protecting drug-addicted corporate executives in London. Meanwhile, Vladislav Dukhovich (Oldman), the ruthless dictator of Belarus is on trial for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. Unable to secure solid evidence or testimony against Dukhovich, the prosecution's last hope is notorious incarcerated hitman Darius Kincaid (Jackson), who agrees to testify against Dukhovich in exchange for the release of his wife Sonia (Hayek) from prison. Led by Interpol Agent Roussel (Yung), an armed convoy escorting Kincaid then departs. With the aid of treacherous Interpol Assistant Director Jean Foucher (Almeida), Dukhovich's men successfully ambush the convoy and kill almost all of the security team. Kincaid manages to eliminate the attackers but their vehicle is destroyed. Having survived the attack, Agent Roussel takes Kincaid to an Interpol safehouse. Realizing that the agency cannot be entrusted with the mission due to possibility of a leak, she employs the help of Bryce to escort and protect Kincaid on the way to The Hague. The two hitchhike to a ferry to Amsterdam, where Sonia is being held. Kincaid reveals that he killed Kurosawa, having spotted him by chance while on another job. As Bryce bemoans his failures at a beer stand, Dukhovich's men attack Kincaid. Bryce has a change of heart and helps Kincaid escape, but is captured. As Dukhovich's men torture him, Kincaid arrives and rescues Bryce. After settling their differences, the two battle their way to The Hague, arriving just in time for Kincaid to testify that Dukhovich tried to hire him to assassinate a political rival, but in the process Kincaid witnessed Dukhovich carry out a mass execution, and uploaded photos of the massacre to a secret FTP site that he provides to the court. Dukhovich admits guilt, then resorts to his backup plan: bombing the court to escape. Foucher leaves the court before the bombing; Roussel deduces he was the traitor. In the confusion after the bomb went off, Dukhovich seizes a gun to kill Kincaid, but Bryce jumps in the path of the bullet, telling Kincaid to stop Dukhovich. Foucher and Roussel fight in which Roussel defeats Foucher, declaring that it's over in which Foucher responds by choking her. Bryce fatally shoots Foucher to save Roussel; she subdues Foucher. Kincaid pursues Dukhovich to the roof, where he attempts to escape by helicopter. Kincaid destroys the helicopter and kicks Dukhovich off the roof to his death for shooting Bryce. Kincaid is rearrested for his various crimes, but breaks out of Belmarsh Prison several months later so he and Sonia can celebrate their anniversary in the bar in Honduras where they first met. As a wild bar brawl breaks out around them, the two kiss.  Cast  * Ryan Reynolds as Michael Bryce, a former triple A rated executive protection agent and CIA officer. * Samuel L.

The script was among the top 2011 Black List of unproduced screenplays. While originally intended as a drama, the script underwent a \\"frantic\\" two-week rewrite to be remade into a comedy several weeks prior to filming. On November 4, 2015, Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson and Gary Oldman were cast in the film, which Jeff Wadlow would direct for Millennium Films. Producers would be Mark Gill, John Thompson, Matt O'Toole and Les Weldon. On February 23, 2016, √âlodie Yung and Salma Hayek were cast in the film, which Lionsgate would distribute in the United States. On March 9, 2016, it was reported that Wadlow had exited the film and Patrick Hughes signed on to direct the film. Principal photography began on April 2, 2016 in London, Amsterdam and Sofia. Originally, just one scene was to be shot in Amsterdam but when Hughes visited the location and saw its surroundings he decided to move some \\"London scenes\\" to the old inner city of Amsterdam. Reception=Box office The Hitman's Bodyguard grossed $75.5 million in the United States and Canada and $105.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $180.6 million, against a production budget of $30 million. In North America, The Hitman's Bodyguard was released on August 18, 2017 alongside Logan Lucky, and was projected to gross $17‚Äì20 million from 3,350 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $8 million on its first day (including $1.65 million from Thursday night previews). It went on to open to $21.6 million, topping the box office. In its second weekend the film made $10.2 million, finishing first at the box office in what was the combined lowest- grossing weekend since September 2001. The film made another $10.2 million the following weekend, becoming the third film of 2017 to finish atop the box office for three straight weeks. However, while it made an estimated $12.9 million over the four-day Labor Day weekend, was again involved in a historically low weekend, as it was the worst combined holiday weekend since 1998. Critical response On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 43% based on 218 reviews, and an average rating of 5.17/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Hitman's Bodyguard coasts on Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds' banter‚Äîbut doesn't get enough mileage to power past an overabundance of action-comedy clich√©s.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score 47 out of 100, based on 42 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 80% overall positive score and a 57% \\"definite recommend\\". Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review and called it a pleasant late-summer surprise, writing: \\"The Hitman's Bodyguard is about as close to a live-action cartoon as you're likely to get this year... That's not a style that works much of the time... but in the hands of The Expendables 3 helmer Patrick Hughes‚Äîand more importantly, owing to the chemistry of stars Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds‚Äîit makes for a delightfully ridiculous screwball action comedy.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers praised the cast, giving it 2.5 stars out of 4 and saying, \\"Reynolds and Jackson make this summer lunacy go down easy with their banter and bullet-dodging skills. They're the only reason that The Hitman's Bodyguard doesn't completely sink into the generic quicksand from whence it came.\\" Sequel In May 2018, it was announced that Reynolds, Jackson and Hayek were in early talks to reprise their roles for a sequel, titled The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, with plans to begin filming later in the year. Production on the sequel began in March 2019, with Frank Grillo joining the cast of the film.https://deadline.com/2019/03/antonio- banderas-richard-e-grant-liongate-the-hitmans-bodyguard-sequel-1202575006/  References  External links  2017 films 2017 action thriller films 2017 action comedy films American films American action comedy films American action thriller films American buddy comedy films American chase films American comedy thriller films 2010s buddy comedy films American courtroom films English-language films Films about bodyguards Films about contract killing Films directed by Patrick Hughes Films scored by Atli √ñrvarsson Films set in Amsterdam Films set in London Films set in The Hague Films shot in Amsterdam Films shot in Bulgaria Films shot in London Lionsgate films 2017 comedy films ","title":"The Hitman's Bodyguard"},{"id":"48465583","text":"Breakfast Dance and Barbecue is a live album by pianist, composer and bandleader Count Basie and his Orchestra with vocalist Joe Williams featuring tracks recorded at a Disc Jockey convention in Florida in 1959 and originally released on the Roulette label.Edwards, D. & Callahan, M.

The album is a collection of demos, tracks that appear on early singles, and rare material that derive mostly from the group members' side-projects before, during, and after the WCPAEB's recording career. All of the tracks featured on Companion were previously released, although a number of them had never appeared on a commercially accessible album. The first nine tracks, devoted to early projects instigated by Bob Markley as the lead vocalist and record producer, hold insight into the unusual self-appointed frontman's musical style. Perhaps more intriguing are the bands formed by Michael Lloyd and Shaun and Danny Harris‚Äîthe young masterminds behind the group's enigmatic leader‚Äîwhose recordings would sometimes manifest themselves on WCPAEB albums and later solo careers. The Laughing Wind, the folk rock predecessor \\"discovered\\" by Markley prior to the band's formation, reveals a more embryonic version of what the group would develop into. The tracks \\"Sassafras\\" and \\"I Won't Hurt You\\", both from the band's first album Volume One (\\"Sassafras\\" only appears as a bonus track on the 1997 reissue of the album), are credited to the WCPAEB. Companion unexpectedly concludes with the avant-garde electronic tune \\"Leiyla and the Poet\\" by experimental composer Halim El-Dabh.

The palace was formed from the amalgamation of the former Palazzo Foscari-Loredan with the adjacent Palazzo Grimani. The narrow facade on the Canal has no entrance, but the facade to the north on the Rio, has a single water door, and is connected to the adjacent campo by a bridge. The facade is decorated with two poliforas. History The Foscari palace, also called Loredan palace, was built on a site belonging to the Giustinian in the 14th-15th centuries. In 1428 it was purchased by the Republic for 6,500 ducats, and transferred to the Marquis of Mantua. A decade later, it was confiscated and given to Francesco Sforza. Nearly a decade later, it was again appropriated and sold by public auction to Doge Francesco Foscari. The Foscari, under Elisabetta Venier Foscari rebuilt it in the mid 1560s. In 1797 the palace was still occupied by descendants of the family, Nicolo Foscari and his brothers. During the Austrian occupation it was used as a barrack for the Croatian soldiers. During the 19th century, it served as the Scuola Superiore di Commercio. From 1564 to 1567, the Grimani palace had been originally built for Vincenzo, of the Santa Maria Formosa branch of the Grimani family.Venice on Foot: With the Itinerary of the Grand Canal and Several Direct, by Hugh A. Douglas, page 321. In the 19th-20th century, it was the residence of Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.H Douglas, (1907), page 260. In 1920, after his marriage to the actress Lyda Borelli, the industrial tycoon Vittorio Cini acquired the Palazzo Foscari on the Grand Canal. He merged it with the adjoining palace. In 1934, under the fascist rule of Mussolini, Cini was named Senator of Italy. Despite the upheavals that occurred at the end of Italy's involvement with the Axis in World War II, Cini remained a major collector of Italian art. After Vittorio's son Giorgio died in 1949, he created in 1951 the Giorgio Cini Foundation, based on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore. This foundation was engaged in the protection, patronage, and research regarding cultural and artistic legacy of Venice. From 1956 to 1958, the architect Tommaso Buzzi was commissioned to redesign the interior of the palace. Vittorio Cini died in 1977. In 1984, his daughter, Yana Cini Alliata di Montereale, donated his collections to the Palazzo Cini Gallery, under the ownership by the Fondazione Giorgio Cini. The collection of artworks, including porcelain and ivories, was increased when the Cini Guglielmi di Vulci heirs permanently loaned a large collection of Ferrarese paintings.Palazzo Cini, official site.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built from 1916 to 1928. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 October 1994.  History  This single-storeyed timber building was constructed in 1916 as the first Urangan Point State School. It was a Type 1 (open-air) school design, built to plans prepared by the Queensland Department of Public Works. Of the 138 open-air schools recently identified as being constructed in Queensland between 1914 and 1922, the first Urangan Point school building survives as one of less than 25% such buildings still in use in Queensland schools. It is also one of the more intact of these structures. European settlement of the Urangan area dates at least to the 1860s, when timbergetters moved through the area. In the late 1860s and early 1870s the area was thrown open for selection, with Maryborough solicitor Edward Corser taking up the bulk of the Urangan township blocks, first surveyed in September 1867. A small fishing industry was established at Urangan Point in the late 19th century, but the main impetus for the town's development was the construction of the rail link to Maryborough (opened 19 December 1913), and the deep water jetty at Urangan Point (erected 1913-1917). In November 1915, the township consisted of a station master's residence, boarding house, hotel, and several small stores. The railway had been completed, opening up Urangan (or Port Maryborough as it was more officially known) as a seaside resort, and the jetty was under construction. Fishing was still the principal commercial activity, and a number of South Sea Islanders who had opted not to return to their home islands under the legislation of 1901, which provided for the repatriation of all South Sea Islanders by the end of 1906, moved to the district and were associated mostly with the fishing industry. Urangan Point residents petitioned the Department of Public Instruction in August 1915, for the establishment of state school in their community. They had the support of the Port Maryborough (Urangan) Progress Association, and Maryborough businessman and politician Edward Corser, who was the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Maryborough from October 1909 to May 1915, and the Member of the Australian House of Representatives for Wide Bay from December 1915 until his death in July 1928. Corser offered to sell to the Department of Public Instruction a central Urangan site of about 2.5 acres, first taken up by his father in 1871, and transferred to himself in 1908. Following a community meeting held on 4 October 1915 and the establishment of a school building committee, a formal application for the establishment of a state school at Urangan Point was made. The prospective enrolment was around 24. The Urangan community already had access to two schools in the district: in Pialba, approximately distant, and Torquay, just over . Most Urangan children attended the overcrowded Torquay School, which was accommodating over twice the number of pupils for which it had been designed, and was in urgent need of additional accommodation. In his report of November 1915, the district schools inspector recommended that a school be established at Urangan, largely to relieve the pressure on Torquay, and that the site offered by Edward Corser would be suitable. Title was transferred to the Secretary for Public Instruction in July 1916. As the Urangan Point settlement was a small one, and considered by the District Inspector of Schools unlikely to grow to any extent, an inexpensive Type I (Open-air) school building was recommended. The building comprised a single room, , with desk accommodation for 30 students. It had canvas blinds to the window openings and two large canvas doors, one at the side and one in the front. There were no verandahs. Open-air schooling had been experimented with around the turn of the century in England and Germany, and in the 1910s was promoted in Queensland by Eleanor Bourne, Director of the Department of Public Instruction's School Medical Service from 1912. A recent study has identified 138 open-air schools constructed in Queensland between 1914 and 1922, with the bulk erected in 1915-16. Approximately 25% of these structures were constructed as annexes to established schools, but most were erected in sparsely settled districts as the only school building. They were comparatively inexpensive to construct, and were considered appropriate in areas unlikely to grow in population, or to transient mining or railway communities. Within a few years, the climatic disadvantages of these open-air schools, particularly those like the Urangan Point School, which had no verandahs, became apparent. When the canvas blinds were drawn against rain or wind, the schoolroom became dark and stuffy, and teaching was almost impossible. The canvas blinds were damaged easily, and required constant attention. They offered no resistance to intruders, and straying or native animals could not be kept out. In the early 1920s, all of the open-air buildings were enclosed with sliding sashes, timber walling and timber doors. Tenders for the Urangan Point school were called in April 1916, with the contract being let in May to Maryborough contractor Christy Hansen, with a price of ¬£183/5-, and a contract time of 3 months. The building was completed some months before opening to students on 9 October 1916. In the following year, local contractor James Ridgers was employed to fence the school grounds. By mid-1918, the canvas blinds, which had no springs but used a weight, controlled by a rope, as counterpoise, were already causing problems. In 1924 these were replaced with the present sliding sash windows; the large canvas door at the front was replaced by vertically jointed timber to match the original walling; and the present entrance, at the side of the building, was filled in and a wooden door installed. In June 1928, the school committee requested a shelter shed or verandah be erected, as on wet days children hadto stand in the rain until the arrival of the teacher. An awning or lean to was subsequently supplied, the work completed on 13 October 1928, at a cost of ¬£20. By mid-1931 the school building, which had been designed to accommodate 30 pupils, was seriously overcrowded, with an average attendance of over 40, and close to 50 pupils enrolled. Additional accommodation was considered urgent, and a new building, with verandahs front and back, to accommodate 40 pupils, was commissioned. The contract was let in late 1931 to Messrs McKewen and Eckstein with a price of ¬£312, and the new building was ready for occupation by mid-February 1932. Students in grades 1-3 remained in the early building, and the older students moved into the new building. This second school building was demolished in 1977. By the early 1960s, Urangan Point State School comprised three classroom blocks, and the first school building had become the school library. In 1977 it was relocated to another site within the school grounds. The building has been re-roofed, and the ridge original ventilator has been removed. It now functions as a music room.  Description  Block D of the Urangan Point State School is a single-room, single- storeyed timber building with concrete piers and a hipped corrugated iron roof. The building is set back from the school's Miller Street frontage with a car parking area to the south, pre-school building and fenced playground to the west, and recent teaching blocks to the north and southeast. The building has boarded ceilings, single-skin vertically boarded walls, with balustrade height walls at the northeast and southeast corners with sliding timber framed windows above. The timber entrance door is located on the northern side and is accessed via timber steps. A lean-to storage room on the western side is enclosed with horizontal timber battens and has a concrete floor. Internally, the building has boarded ceilings raked to collar-beam height. Early timber shelving is located in the southwest corner, with the blackboard positioned centrally on the western wall.  Heritage listing  Block D of the Urangan Point State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 October 1994 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The building is significant as a substantially intact, small rural school building of the early 20th century. Evidence of its early open-air form remains in the extant sliding sash windows which replaced the original canvas blinds in 1924. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building remains one of the most intact of the former open-air schools surviving in Queensland.

He is also the founder of Hope North, a secondary school and sanctuary for young victims of the war, in Uganda. Early life Okello Sam grew up in a village located in Northern Uganda raised by his father and his father's three wives. He is the third child of 20 children. At the age of 16, on his way to school to pick up some test scores, he, and the group of students he was with, were abducted and forced to be part of the Lords Resistance Army. The group of kids were transported to Syria for a gruesome two week basic training. From there, they were split up and brought to various war fronts. About two years later, during a pitched battle, Okello found the opportunity and managed to escape. He managed to hitch a ride to Gulu, where he assumed his family would take shelter. When he did not find them there, Okello went back to his village, finding it an abandoned war zone. Okello decided to go to the capital, Kampala, where his uncle lived. Okello's uncle gave Okello shelter. Okello stayed in his uncle's two room house along with his uncle's two wives and four children. Okello then did multiple duties such as, washing clothes, carrying water, and cleaning cars to make money and continue his education. He attended Makerere University pursuing a diploma in Performance Arts. During this time, Okello discovered a dance company called Ndere Troupe and eventually got an interview and was offered to join the company. Through this, Okello's talent as a dancer, musician, actor, choreographer, cultural promoter, trainer, and arts director, became noticed. While in college, Okello married Marian Lubega and in 1994, they had their first child, Lawino Mieke Marilyn. In 1998, Okello Sam's younger brother, Godfrey, was abducted during school with a group of 50 other children. Okello lived in hope that one day his brother, too, would escape. That is, until one morning, when Okello discovered gruesome photos in the morning newspaper, of 300 people killed in his home village. This included his brother. To honor is brother, Okello created a modern play based on Ugandan and Acholi storytelling and musical traditions which is called \\"Forged in Fire\\". In his own words, \\"... my relatives, my friends, guys I go to school with, and when I got the news, I just broke down. So I get into my car, driving to the north, just doing it out of anger, out of frustration, so many of the people you know have died and you don‚Äôt know what else to do. So we kept on driving, driving, driving and I stopped. And an idea came to my mind.\\" Hope North Okello Sam found Hope North in 1998 after his brother's death. Hope North is a school and sanctuary for young victims of the civil war. Hope North assists orphans, refugees, and former child soldiers. Hope North is accredited as a secondary school with 26 dedicated educators. The school must work with multiple obstacles such as lack of textbooks and no computers. The school has an international arts program, vocal training, and a working farm which is operated by the staff. The staff strive to give children a well-organized education which leads to careers.

The website is a classroom project for a third and fourth grade combined classroom from Blair-Taylor Elementary School in Blair, Wisconsin. As of late 2019, the eagle cam focuses on two eagles named Blair and Taylor. People from over 145 countries have viewed the live stream, encompassing tens of thousands monthly viewers. As of 2015, the site had over 2 million views. Eagles4kids also has a partnership with the National Eagle Center in Wabasha, Minnesota. History In the fall of 2010, teacher Michael Lawrence and his third- and fourth-grade students became interested in eagles after watching an eagle cam from California. Lawrence secured a grant for camera equipment and permission from a local landowner to set up a camera by a nearby eagle's nest. This camera was planted in a tree above the nest and can zoom in. Once the live stream was set up, the public was able to view the nest. When Lawrence moved out of the district, Darrin Briggs and his class took over the project. Briggs enhanced the project by adding a pan-tilt-zoom camera and adding audio to both cameras. Because the cameras are in a rural area, the connection is often lost, halting the live-stream. Many viewers comment that the live stream is like soap opera because there is so much eagle drama. Some viewers consider themselves ‚ÄúEagleholics.‚Äù Season 1 (school year 2010-2011) After setting up the camera, students named the eagles Lucy and Larry. Lucy disappeared at the start of the egg laying period and left Larry alone at the nest. Many days later, another eagle came to the nest, but students concluded it did not behave like Lucy and it must be a different individual. Something strange was going on and it didn't appear the ‚Äúold‚Äù Lucy would return. Students decided this eagle would be the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Lucy. Lucy did not lay any eggs that year. Season 2 (2011-2012) Lucy laid two eggs at the beginning of March, 2012. Once an eagle has laid its egg(s), both parents incubate them for about 35 days. The first egg hatched on April 7, 2012; the students named the first eagle Luke. The second egg hatched on April 10, 2012; the students named it Lilly. During this time, it became clear that the female eagle was a not the original Lucy. Since Larry was teaching \\"new\\" Lucy how to feed chicks, it appeared \\"new\\" Lucy was a first-time mother. Season 3 (2012-2013) Around November 2012, Lucy incurred a terrible injury to both of her feet. The injury on her right foot seemed severe enough that it raised concerns about her ability to survive. Lucy ended up losing her toes on her right foot. After seeing her injury, a decision had to be made about how to help Lucy. Efforts to trap Lucy failed and it was finally decided the best was to leave her alone. Larry took control and started to help Lucy. She ended up gaining more strength in her foot and was doing well without her full mobility. Then on March 9, 2013, Lucy laid an egg. More than a month later the egg popped and was destroyed. Season 4 (2013-2014) At the start of the season the eagles flew to and from the nest. Then, in about March, Lucy had not been seen for a while and a new female appeared at the nest with Larry. It was discovered that Larry had had two and possibly three females in the nest after Lucy left. No eggs were laid during this season. Season 5 (2014-2015) Larry was not spotted during the school term ending December 2014, and by February two new eagles appeared in the nest and seemed to be taking it over. The female eagle was named Blair and the male was named Taylor. In the middle of February the nest was attacked, apparently by Taylor. After the attack Taylor was not seen for a few weeks. On February 18, 2015, Blair laid her first egg, and a few days later her second appeared. The eagle that Taylor potentially attacked came to the nest but expressed no interest in helping incubate. On March 3, Taylor came back to the nest with substantial injuries. The eggs never hatched and were destroyed by a raccoon.

Early life Lawrence Rhodes was born in Mount Hope, West Virginia on November 24, 1939. Following his second birthday, his family moved to Detroit, Michigan. At age 9, his classmate, Glenda Ann Bush, introduced Rhodes to tap dancing. The pair became a dance duo, performing at functions around the city as \\"Buddy and Glenda Ann.\\" (Rhodes went by the nickname of Buddy until he was renamed by Robert Joffrey in the 1960s.) He discovered ballet at age 14 after seeing a Ballet Theatre performance of Swan Lake. Rhodes began his training with Violette Armand. By the summer of 1956, he was touring midwestern state fairs with the Chicago-based dance teacher Dorothy Hild. In 1957, Rhodes arrived in New York City, where he studied at the Ballet Russe School. Among his instructors there were Leon Danielian and Frederic Franklin. Dancer From 1958 to 1960, Lawrence danced with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the corps de ballet. At the end of his second year with Ballet Russe, Rhodes started studying with Robert Joffrey. He was invited to join the Joffrey troupe in 1960. Lawrence Rhodes became a principal dancer with Joffrey Ballet, acclaimed for his performances in such works as Gerald Arpino's \\"Partita for Four\\" and \\"Ropes\\" and Brian MacDonald's \\"Time Out of Mind.\\" By 1962, arts patroness and heiress Rebekah Harkness had become the company's primary sponsor. Through the association with Harkness and her foundation, Joffrey Ballet gained national and international attention, performing at the White House and touring the Middle East and U.S.S.R. Since Harkness' foundation was paying for every facet of the company's existence, Rebekah insisted on greater involvement in artistic decisions. She ultimately demanded that the company be named after her, but would allow Robert Joffrey to stay on as artistic director. Because all of the dancers' contracts were with the Harkness Foundation, Joffrey had little say in the matter. In February 1964, Harkness‚Äô lawyers announced the name change and told the dancers they would be absorbed into the new company or could ask for release from their contracts. Only two dancers broke their contracts. Rhodes and ten other dancers: Lone Isaksen, Brunilda Ruiz, Helgi T√≥masson, Margaret Mercier, Marlene Rizzo, Finis Jhung, Felix Smith, Suzanne Hammons, Karina Rieger and Elizabeth Carroll, moved on to the Harkness Ballet. Rhodes' power as a dancer reached its peak with Harkness Ballet. He was lauded for performances in Stuart Hodes' \\"The Abyss\\", John Butler's \\"Sebastian\\" and \\"After Eden\\", and Rudy van Dantzig's \\"Monument for a Dead Boy.\\" Rhodes was noted not only for his exceptional technique but also for his artistry as an actor. Reviewing \\"Sebastian,\\" New York Times critic Don McDonagh wrote, \\"Mr. Rhodes' intensity is allowed full sway and he dominates the ballet. Emotion is the life blood of the work and no one on the ballet stage is capable of generating as much of it as Mr. Rhodes.\\" New York Magazine's dance critic was equally impressed. \\"The company of brilliant dancers is led by the fabulous Lawrence Rhodes. He is one of the world's great dancers, and his double strength as an actor-dancer leaves him few rivals in the ballet world.\\" In 1968, Rhodes took over as Harkness Ballet's artistic director, voted in by his fellow company members. In this position, he balanced performing and administrative duties until Rebekah Harkness disbanded the troupe in 1970. Rhodes and his new wife dancer Lone Isaksen spent the following year with the Dutch National Ballet. For most of the 1970s, Rhodes worked primarily as a guest artist. He appeared with the Pennsylvania Ballet, Dennis Wayne's Dancers and the Feld Ballet, and toured with ballerinas Naomi Sorkin and Anne Marie de Angelo. From 1971 to 1973, he served as co-director of Milwaukee Ballet. Beginning in 1974, Rhodes toured Italy with Carla Fracci, performing the role of Albrecht to her Giselle and dancing the part of Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet. He gave his last performance (in the role of Mercutio) in 1978. Teacher, Director During his time in Italy, Rhodes developed an interest in teaching and gave daily ballet classes to Fracci's dancers. Returning to the U.S., he worked at New York University for ten years, first as a faculty member and then as chairman of the dance department. With the assistance of Deborah Jowitt, he helped to make the program more professional, reduced the time to attain an undergraduate degree from four years to three, and overhauled the Master of Fine Arts degree offerings. Rhodes also revived the Second Avenue Dance Company (SADC), a Tisch School of the Arts' program that had lapsed in 1989, and made it mandatory for all students in their final year. The Second Avenue Dance Company is a working dance troupe made up of graduate and undergraduate students. Each year, four notable guest choreographers create new work or set existing master works to provide students with a professional experience that allows them to explore new styles of dance. Students also develop their own choreography, which is showcased in concerts throughout their SADC year. In 1989, Rhodes joined Les Grands Ballet Canadiens de Montreal as artistic director. He stayed with the company until 1999. During summers, he guest taught around the world, primarily at Nederlands Dans Theater, Ballet Frankfurt and Lyon Opera Ballet, where he returned annually until his death. He also served as a judge for the Beijing International Invitational Ballet Competition, the Seoul International Dance Competition, the Youth America Grand Prix and the Valentina Kozlova International Ballet Competition. In 2002, Rhodes became the head of the Juilliard School's Dance Division, a position he held until 2017. He streamlined the dance curriculum and increased the students' performance opportunities by creating \\"New Dances.\\" The New Dances initiative is an annual concert that features each class of students in a new work made especially for them by a prominent choreographer. During Rhodes' tenure, Juilliard dancers also participated in three major performance tours in the U.S. and Europe. In July 2009, Lawrence received the Lifetime Career Achievement Award from Dance Teacher Magazine. Juilliard Dance Division was awarded the 64th Capezio Award in November 2015. The Capezio Award is given to individuals, companies or institutions that show respectful dignity through the exhibition of dance qualities such as creation, innovation and imagination. Juilliard's 2017 New Dances edition celebrated the legacy of Lawrence Rhodes, its creator and curator, and his impactful 15 years as head of the Dance Division. Personal life and death In 1970, Rhodes married longtime colleague and dance partner, Danish ballerina Lone Isaksen. They had a son, Mark, born in October 1971. And had a granddaughter named Tamsin. In interviews, Rhodes spoke of his lifelong passion for travel. He and his wife also were involved in environmental causes. Isaksen died on November 2, 2010, after a long battle with cancer. Rhodes died on March 27, 2019, from a heart attack.

The notion was first introduced by Lawrence G. Brown and Gert K. Pedersen.  Definition  The real rank of a unital C*-algebra A is the smallest non-negative integer n, denoted RR(A), such that for every (n + 1)-tuple (x0, x1, ... ,xn) of self-adjoint elements of A and every Œµ > 0, there exists an (n + 1)-tuple (y0, y1, ... ,yn) of self-adjoint elements of A such that \\\\sum_{i=0}^n y_i^2 is invertible and \\\\lVert \\\\sum_{i=0}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 \\\\rVert < \\\\varepsilon. If no such integer exists, then the real rank of A is infinite. The real rank of a non-unital C*-algebra is defined to be the real rank of its unitization.  Comparisons with dimension  If X is a locally compact Hausdorff space, then RR(C0(X)) = dim(X), where dim is the Lebesgue covering dimension of X. As a result, real rank is considered a noncommutative generalization of dimension, but real rank can be rather different when compared to dimension. For example, most noncommutative tori have real rank zero, despite being a noncommutative version of the two-dimensional torus. For locally compact Hausdorff spaces, being zero-dimensional is equivalent to being totally disconnected. The analogous relationship fails for C*-algebras; while AF-algebras have real rank zero, the converse is false. Formulas that hold for dimension may not generalize for real rank. For example, Brown and Pedersen conjectured that RR(A ‚äó B) ‚â§ RR(A) + RR(B), since it is true that dim(X √ó Y) ‚â§ dim(X) + dim(Y). They proved a special case that if A is AF and B has real rank zero, then A ‚äó B has real rank zero. But in general their conjecture is false, there are C*-algebras A and B with real rank zero such that A ‚äó B has real rank greater than zero.  Real rank zero  C*-algebras with real rank zero are of particular interest. By definition, a unital C*-algebra has real rank zero if and only if the invertible self-adjoint elements of A are dense in the self- adjoint elements of A. This condition is equivalent to the previously studied conditions: * (FS) The self-adjoint elements of A with finite spectrum are dense in the self-adjoint elements of A. * (HP) Every hereditary C*-subalgebra of A has an approximate identity consisting of projections. This equivalence can be used to give many examples of C*-algebras with real rank zero including AW*-algebras, Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebras, and von Neumann algebras. More broadly, simple unital purely infinite C*-algebras have real rank zero including the Cuntz algebras and Cuntz‚ÄìKrieger algebras. Since simple graph C*-algebras are either AF or purely infinite, every simple graph C*-algebra has real rank zero. Having real rank zero is a property closed under taking direct limits, hereditary C*-subalgebras, and strong Morita equivalence. In particular, if A has real rank zero, then Mn(A) the algebra of n √ó n matrices over A has real rank zero for any integer n ‚â• 1\\\\.

His father was Jawala Mul Puri from the village of Khem Karan, in what was then the Lahore District of British India. He started his career as a bank clerk in Lahore, when he published two anti-colonial pamphlets and a political cartoon of an emaciated \\"Father India\\" bound in chains. He attracted the attention of British authorities for having published what they termed \\"objectionable pamphlets\\" and a \\"seditious cartoon.\\" The British confiscated Puri's pamphlets, arrested his agent, and harassed him directly. He decided to leave India. In late 1906, he migrated to the United States, as a political exile, according to historian Bipan Chandra.  Activism in the United States  In 1907, he founded the Hindustan Association. According to his own description in Circular-i-Azadi, the association was based in San Francisco, California, and had branches in Astoria, Oregon and Vancouver, British Columbia. Lalkar describes \\"the principal condition for membership of the HA was that the members would rid themselves of prejudice based on caste, colour and creed.\\" Between 1907 and 1908, he launched and published three issues of Circular-i-Azadi (also transliterated as Circular-e-Azadi), an Urdu language paper critical of British rule in India and focused on political education, published out of San Francisco and Oakland, California. The first issue was printed using lithography. Historian Maia Ramnath describes the publication as \\"one of the first significant pieces of anticolonial propaganda circulated on the West Coast.\\" The publication included original writing, as well as extracts from other publications, including the Gaelic American, and according to Ramnath, most likely the Indian Sociologist and Bande Mataram. Chandra describes Puri as pledging support to Swadeshi movement in the publication; Ramnath quotes a 1908 issue that reads, in part, \\"The king is no longer to us the representative of God in the country. We have come to know that people possess the right of appointing and dethroning kings‚Ä¶Swadeshi is for Indians what Sinn Fein is for Ireland.\\" Circular-i-Azadi came to the attention of the British Director of Criminal Intelligence, and was prohibited from shipment to India due to its allegedly \\"seditious\\" content. In January 1908, a Director of Criminal Intelligence report described the report, which had appeared in India, as having as \\"frankly revolutionary,\\" working \\"to organise an Indian national party among Indians who go to America for employment,\\" and \\"capable of working a great mischief.\\"  Life in the United States  In the United States, Ramnath Puri worked as a hospital watchman, interpreter, mining college student, fruit picker, waiter, entrepreneur, and postal worker. According to Karen Leonard, Puri \\"returned for his wife in 1906 and brought her to San Francisco, where he had become a U.S. citizen‚Ä¶the three Puri children were born in the first two decades of the century.\\" In 1908, the Overland Monthly described Puri as a student of English. In 1910, he acquired land in Oakland, California. As of 1917, he was described as a naturalized United States citizen, an alumnus of the University of California, a well- known author, and a San Francisco area resident of ten years.

KWWA offers leadership training and monitors the effects of government policies on women workers. It was the first national women workers association in Korea. KWWA is also one of the founding members of the umbrella organization of the Korean Women's Associations United (KWAU).  Historical background  After the end of the Korean War, South Korea tried to rebuild the nation. Besides the dictatorial characteristics of Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee's administrations, women, mostly highly educated women, started to work towards establishing gender equality in South Korea. They created women's organizations, such as the Korean National Council of Women in 1959. After the Park regime established its position in power, it allowed some conservative organizations to exist, as long as they did not show hostility to the government's policies and aimed to support the state. Starting from 1963, Park's regime also promoted the industrialization of Korean society; women factory workers played a significant role in developing the South Korean economy. They were low-wage workers, often working under severe conditions, which caused many health issues. Even though Park's regime regulated anti-governmental organizations, women factory workers began to raise their voices in the 1970s in order to improve their working conditions and establish labor rights. The women workers' movements caught the attention of the South Korean public and led to the progressive and grassroots democratization movement in the 1980s. The movement gathered different types of people in terms of gender, class, age, marital status, and religion. Women activists in the 1980s thought that social reconstruction was necessary in order to liberate women. The democratization of South Korea was achieved in 1987. Labor protection laws, such as the Equal Employment Act, were enacted as well. The law was meant to respond to demands from inside the country as well as to pressure from the international community. However, male workers started to show their presence as a dominant group of workers, especially after the late 1980s. As a result, the Korean Women Workers Association (KWWA) was founded in 1987 to unite women workers and establish their rights. The founding members included both intellectuals and working-class women who actively participated in the resistance movement in the 1970s and 1980s.  History  In South Korea, before labor reforms, women who got married or who had children were forced to retire. In order to organize women into already established trade unions, the KWWA was founded in 1987. KWWA addressed issues that were being ignored by male-dominated unions which many women had already joined. In addition to organizing blue collar workers, KWWA organized those who were unemployed, domestic workers and other informal jobs. Shortly after their formation, KWWA played a large role in supporting the passage of the Equal Employment Act in 1987. In 1989, The KWWA staged a protest by occupying a factory in Masan and living there. Also in the 1980s, KWWA were responsible for Nike partner factories raising the wages of workers in their facilities. In 1990, they helped get the Infant Care Act passed. By 1993 KWWA affected the workplace with daycare centers being built near workplaces. In 1996, a former worker from the Committee of Asian Women (CAW), Maria Chol-Soon Rhie, became the chair of the organization. KWWA has been a standard for other Asian countries to look to for best practices in improving equality in the workplace. In 2007, the organization celebrated its 20th year anniversary.  Goals  After the democratization movement in the 1980s, South Korean society shifted to focus on the simin (civilized) ideal and slightly moved away from militant and anti-governmental ideals. Correspondingly, women's associations also changed their attitude to work closely with the government and expanded their targets and goals. After the 1990s, the KWWA tried to work for the rights of women workers, as well as against the structural subordination of women that persisted in the society. The KWWA created the Korean Women Workers Association United in 1992 to organize its regional branches in Seoul, Incheon, Pusan, Bucheon, Sungnam, Kwangju, and Machang. The KWWA's successes included the prohibition of sexual violence and indirect gender discrimination during the employment process under the Equal Employment Act in 1999. Also, it expanded the duration of maternity leave from 60 to 90 days in 2001. The KWWA continuously monitors government policies in order to reflect the demands of marginalized women workers in the political sphere.Son, Yong Ju. (2007). \\"20 Years of Korean Women Workers Association Evaluation and Future Tasks.\\" The KWWA and its affiliated organization Korean Women's Association United registered their names and were officially acknowledged by the government in 1995. When the Korean economy experienced a crisis in 1997-1998, women workers often became victims of job dismissals and tended to become irregular and temporary workers.The Korean government supported the layoffs of workers in order to overcome the recession and keep the country's competitiveness in the global economy.Women were considered to be responsible and suitable for taking care of the children and family, instead of working outside their homes.The patriarchal stereotype in South Korean society encouraged women workers to engage in unstable jobs. Under these circumstances, the KWWA established Korean Women's Trade Union (KWTU) in 1999 to unite and work on the issues of irregularly employed women workers.The KWWA worked with the KWTU and provided vocational training, child-care support, and counseling systems to help women workers. At the same time, The KWWA provided political education to allow the workers to learn about the necessity of collective union activism and to develop their leadership in labor organizations. The KWWA refers to its future goals in a report published in commemoration of its 20th anniversary.The report claims that the KWWA needs to continue to establish the legal status and financial well-being of women workers. Not only that, it mentions that the quality of women workers' lives should also be protected. The KWWA believes that it needs to provide a better welfare system that allows more women workers to participate in activism without sacrificing their daily lives as mothers, wives, or low-wage workers. The KWWA is now trying to deal with the institutionalized discrimination of women workers in a neoliberal,capitalist society. In the academic article \\"Korean Women Workers' Activism,\\" the author, Park values the work of the KWWA and the KWTU for providing an environment in which irregular women workers can gather and find fellows who are willing to change the difficult working environment.  Ongoing issues  There are critical discussions regarding the outcomes of the women's labor movements in the 1970s and 1980s. As the democratic movement in the 1980s was a collective and grassroots movement, Korean society sidelined the potential conflict between different social positions, such as class, gender, or political ideals. For example, the wives and mothers of male worker activists joined the democratic movement in the 1980s as they felt they were responsible for making a better society as mothers and wives. However, this attitude did not necessarily change gender roles and stereotypes in South Korea, which often stabilize the heteropatriarchal family system. Also, the legalization of gender equality in South Korea was partly a way of accommodating the pressure of the international community and that of Korean women workers. Even though gender equality in the workplace was legally protected, it was not always applied to the everyday lives of women workers. In addition, the KWWA revealed that there is not always enough communication between the younger and the older generations, as well as the activists who organize the association and the others who are in regional branches. The KWWA understands that there are differences in opinions and values between generations. The older activists tend to have an affinity with the progressive labor movement, whereas the younger generation tries to find other possibilities.Shin Gyeong-a.\\"Sharing the Experience of Twelve Activists in the Women Workers‚Äô Movement: an analysis of interviews with KWWA activists\\" in 20th Anniversary of Korean Women Workers Association: 20 Years of Korean Women Workers Movement Evaluation and Future Tasks. Jennifer Jihye Chun, the professor in the UCLA Asian American Studies Department and the International Institute, argues that there is a strategy that women's organizations should consider utilizing. Chun suggests that women's labor activists need to make the public realize the structural subordination of women while maintaining solidarity between people. Militant forms of activism, such as hunger strikes are sometimes perceived as outdated forms of resistance and do not necessarily lead to individual awareness. Today, some NGOs acknowledge the lack of funding to organize and the lack of public awareness of the issues they raise; the burdens of activists who work full-time and who do not are polarized. The KWWA also insists on a limited financial reward for its activists, which compounds the difficulties of members in balancing their activism and domestic work. The KWWA is still working to deal with the structural subordination of women workers so that it can fill the gap between legislation and their everyday lives.

He exerted his first mandate like politician Maranhense, in the position of Deputy Federal by the same state. In the years 2008 and 2010 he applied for mayor of S√£o Lu√≠s and Governor of Maranh√£o respectively, being defeated in the two elections by his opponents Jo√£o Castelo (PSDB) in 2008 and Roseana Sarney (PMDB) in 2010. In 2011, she assumed the presidency of Embratur in the then first term of President Dilma Rousseff (PT). On February 14, 2012, her 13-year-old younger son died of an asthma attack at Santa Lucia Hospital in Brasilia. The Federal District civilian police are deployed and investigate alleged negligence on the part of the hospital. In 2014, he was elected in the first round by the Maranh√£o electorate for the position of State Governor, with 63.52 percent of the valid votes, and later taken to a solemn session at the Legislative Assembly of the state of Maranh√£o, the ceremony of transmission of the position by the Interim Governor, Arnaldo Melo to Fl√°vio Dino, took place in front of the Palace of Lions, headquarters of the executive power of Maranh√£o. The presence of national political leaders and the state itself.  Accusations against his management at the head of Embratur  His name was linked to irregularities during his administration in front of Embratur, in which the current direction of the institute denies any accusation and it is pointed out that such slanders were orchestrated in order to manipulate the vote of the Maranh√£o electorate in the midst of the evident electoral process of the year of 2014, the management of Dino was approved by the General Comptroller of the Union (CGU) as well as by the other control bodies belonging to the Union. Political career  Congressman  In 2006, Dino was a candidate for federal deputy in Maranh√£o by the Communist Party of Brazil. He was elected with more than 120 thousand votes (4.3% of the total), being the fourth candidate more voted in the litigation. In the Federal Chamber, he stood out as one of the drafters of the Political Reform project. In 2010, Dino was elected one of the most influential parliamentarians in Brazil by the Inter-Union Department of Parliamentary Advisory (DIAP). He was also elected, for four consecutive years, one of the best parliamentarians of the country by the site Congress in Focus.  Elections 2008  Fl√°vio Dino was a candidate for mayor of S√£o Lu√≠s in the 2008 elections by the Popular Unity Coalition, being defeated in the second round by former governor Jo√£o Castelo, of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), which ruled the state from 1979 to 1982, when was a member of the defunct Social Democratic Party and an ally of Jos√© Sarney.  Elections 2010  Dino was a candidate for the government of Maranh√£o by the Muda Maranh√£o coalition, which counted, in addition to the PCdoB, with the Brazilian Socialist Party and the Popular Socialist Party (PPS). The Workers' Party (PT), which decided in internal election to support Dino's candidacy, was forced by the National Directory to support the re-election of then-Governor Roseana Sarney of the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement who had been leader of the Lula government in the Senate Federal of Brazil. According to a report published by Veja magazine, Sarney's emissaries tried to buy the votes of PT delegates to support the coalition with the PMDB, for values ranging from R $20,000 to R $40,000. After losing the support of the PT, Fl√°vio Dino had considered forming an alliance with Jackson Lago, but gave up after Jackson's reluctance to give up his own candidacy in favor of the alliance with PCdoB. Despite having lost the support of the PT, Dino was supported by famous government figures in his campaign, such as Sports Minister Orlando Silva, Institutional Relations Minister Alexandre Padilha and the Minister of Justice Luiz Paulo Barreto. The election in Maranh√£o is marked by the legal uncertainty of the candidacies of both Roseana Sarney and Jackson Lago. The promulgation of the Clean Sheet Law, months before the lawsuit, put their candidacy in check, since the law vetoes the candidacy of politicians convicted in a collegiate court. Roseana was sentenced in 20,000 reais for early electoral propaganda, comparing works of her administration with that of ex-ally Jose Reinaldo Tavares. Already Lago was sentenced in the Superior Electoral Court for abuse of economic power and purchase of votes. He had as a penalty the annulment of the governor's term, which should make him ineligible for eight years under the new law. Despite this, they had the registration released by the Regional Electoral Court of Maranh√£o. The State Electoral Ministry (MPE) of the state has asked to contest Lake's candidacy, while candidate for state deputy Aderson Lago (PSDB) has requested the impugnation of Roseana's candidacy. On September 1, TSE Minister Hamilton Carvalhido filed an appeal contesting Roseana's candidacy. The appeal against Lago still awaits trial. In the last week of campaigning on radio and television, he began to use the \\"no one cassa\\" staff in his advertisements, irritating the Lake campaign coordination. In addition to Roseana being convicted of early electoral propaganda, Fl√°vio Dino's coalition has filed two representations in MPE against the candidate for abuse of political and economic power. According to the lawyer of the coalition, Carlos Eduardo Lula, there are indications that Roseana would have contracted the services of publicist Duda Mendon√ßa even before the beginning of the electoral period. The intention of the coalition of Dino is to provoke an investigation of the MEP that provokes possible action against the liberation of the registry of candidacy or against the expedition of diploma if Roseana is elected. From August 27 to September 17, 2010, Fl√°vio Dino grew by almost 50% in the survey conducted by IBOPE in the state. It went from 13% to 21% of voting intentions, tying with Jackson Lago in second place. According to a survey by the Constat institute, which was hired by the \\"Small Journal\\" and held from September 23 to 26, Dino had 25% of the voting intentions and was more likely to face Governor Roseana Sarney in a possible second round of voting. What a Lago In a scenario where he faces Roseana in the second round, Dino would be elected with 43% of the vote, against 42% of Roseana. The Constat was, along with Toledo & Associados, the only research institute that predicted a second round in 2006. There was no second round in that election. Fl√°vio Dino was in second place and Roseana was re-elected in 2010 with 50.08% of the valid votes to exercise another four years, from January 1, 2011 Until December 31, 2014, raising doubts about the smoothness of the process, as suspicions of fraud have surfaced. In the state elections in 2010, Roseana Sarney was the winner with a tight 50.08% lead in the first round, against her main opponents Fl√°vio Dino (29.49%) and Jackson Lago (19.54%). However, their victory was only facilitated by the high voter abstention (23.97%), the largest in the whole of Brazil and also accusations of irregularities of the candidates during the election, including Roseana herself.  Elections 2014  Elected governor of Maranh√£o in 1994 and re- elected in 1998, Roseana Sarney returned to the Palace of the Lions in 2009 before decision of the Superior Electoral Court and won a new term in 2010. However, the crisis in the Pebble Penitentiary Complex political and administrative wear that prevented the governor from resigning in order to contest a vacancy in the Brazilian Federal Senate and postponed the definition of a name to be supported by the \\"sarneist\\" group that has run the state since the 1965 elections and From then on he made the majority of the governors of Maranh√£o, except for the election of Osvaldo da Costa Nunes Freire by President Ernesto Geisel in 1974, and the victory of Jackson Lake in 2006 thanks to a split between those led by Jos√© Sarney. In the political environment were strong rumors indicating that Luis Fernando Silva, would be the indicated candidate for the succession of Roseana Sarney (PMDB). The former federal deputy and former president of Embratur, was the candidate of opposition to the government of Maranh√£o. He was a candidate for government also in 2010, and disputed the city of S√£o Lu√≠s in 2008. For the elections in 2014, he obtained alliances with the PSDB and the then presidential Aecio Neves. However, Marina Silva (PSB) also participated in this plaque because of the regional alliance. The federal deputy Carlos Brand√£o (PSDB) was the candidate for vice governor and then deputy mayor of S√£o Lu√≠s, Roberto Rocha (PSB) was the candidate of the plate to the federal senate, with the support of the then mayor of S√£o Lu√≠s, Edivaldo Holland Junior (PTC), the mayor of Imperatriz, Sebasti√£o Madeira (PSDB), and other electoral cables. It formed the coalition \\"Todos por Maranh√£o\\", composed by PCdoB, PSDB, PSB, PP, SD, PTC, PPS, PROS and PDT. He supported the re-election of Dilma Rousseff, because some of his local alliances were part of the national coalition, including PCdoB itself. In the midst of the race for the position of governor of Maranh√£o in 2014, Edison Lob√£o Filho in an interview in a program of Radio Mirante, would have offered R $28 thousand for who could denounce and present evidence that incriminated its main opponent in the election Fl√°vio Dino (PCdoB) for crimes such as administrative misconduct, corruption and theft during his term as president of Embratur, according to him, low-slang words were used during the interview by the then pre-candidate comparing his family to that of Its competitor. The accused chose not to respond to the comments, however, the president of the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB) in the state, M√°rcio Jerry stated: \\"The Maranhans expect a clean campaign, with debates and not with lies and aggressions. For Maranh√£o, a wealthy state but impoverished by bad politics. \\" Then senator, Lobinho was the candidate for the government of the state supported by the then governor Roseana Sarney, that had high indices of rejection in Maranh√£o and in all Brazil. There was Arnaldo Melo, deputy state president of the Legislative Assembly of Maranh√£o, as a candidate for vice governor, and Gast√£o Vieira, minister of tourism as a candidate for the federal senate. Although it was \\"thoroughbred\\", the coalition \\"Pra Frente Maranh√£o\\" was extensive, and had PRB, PTB, PTB, PSL, PTN, PSC, PR, DEM, PSDC, PRTB, PHS, PMN, PV, PRP, PSD and PT of B, besides the PMDB.  Context and Oligarchy of Clan Sarney  The election of Fl√°vio Dino was symbolic, since it broke with decades of predominance of the family of Jose Sarney on the poorest State of the Country. Since the end of the Era Vargas the Maranh√£o carried out twelve direct and three indirect elections for the government of the state and in that the Power was exercised by Vitorino Freire until the Military Regime of 1964 and since then by Jose Sarney. Although the two were coreligionists at the time of the PSD, they separated when the latter opted for the National Democratic Union (UDN) and was elected governor in 1965 with the support Of President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco. Forced to coexist within the National Renewal Alliance, they did not publicly disagree although they led their own wings in the ruling party, but the strength of the \\"sarneists\\" became more evident from the moment Jos√© Sarney became a senator in Brasilia. In this condition he became national president of the National Renewal Alliance and the Social Democratic Party, although President Ernesto Geisel acted in favor of the \\"vitorinistas\\" in 1974 when choosing Osvaldo da Costa Nunes Freire as governor. Throughout the Jo√£o Figueiredo government, an alliance between the governor Jo√£o Castelo and the senator Jos√© Sarney, allowing the victory of the Social Democratic Party in 1982 when Luis Rocha was the first resident of the Palace of Lions elected by popular vote in seventeen years. Nevertheless, the articulations inherent to the presidential succession broke up the union, after Jo√£o Castelo supported Paulo Maluf, while Jos√© Sarney joined the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement and was elected vice president of Tancredo Neves. As the new president fell ill and passed away without taking office, the Planalto Palace was in the hands of Jos√© Sarney who allied with Epit√°cio Cafeteira and made governor in 1986 with the record of 81.02 percent of the vote. However, the Sarney's five-year wear and tear motivated an agreement between Jo√£o Castelo and Epit√°cio Cafeteira from 1990 when \\"sarneism\\" elected Edison Lob√£o. In 1994 and 1998, Roseana Sarney won the elections, restoring direct control of her family over the state. Another flank of opposition to Jos√© Sarney appeared to the left and was led by Jackson Lago who was elected mayor of S√£o Lu√≠s in 1988, 1996 and 2000. Born in Pedreiras and graduated in Medicine, In the Federal University of Maranh√£o, was elected state deputy by the Brazilian Democratic Movement in 1974 in Maranh√£o State. With the return to the multiparty system, he organized the PDT in the state and was Secretary of Health in the Epit√°cio Cafeteira government before being elected three times mayor of the Maranh√£o capital and disputing the government on two occasions. Elected in the second round, Jackson Lago benefited from the breakup between Senator Jos√© Sarney and Governor Jos√© Reinaldo Tavares who previously championed Edson Vidigal's candidacy and then contributed to the first defeat of Sarney family in direct elections to the Lions' Palace dispute.  Governor of the State of Maranh√£o  Fl√°vio Dino (PCdoB) was elected governor of the state of Maranh√£o, just in the first round of the Brazilian general election with 1,877,064 votes (63.52% of the votes). Dino obtained 881,445 votes more than his opponent Edison Lob√£o Filho (PMDB), who received 995,619 votes (33.69% of the valid votes). He was the first governor that the Communist Party of Brazil was able to elect in Brazil. Fl√°vio Dino (PCdoB) received the diploma of Governor of Maranh√£o from the Regional Electoral Tribunal of Maranh√£o (TRE-MA) together with his deputy governor-elect, Carlos Brand√£o (PSDB) on December 19, 2014. The same person had ascended to the position on January 1, 2015, succeeding Arnaldo Melo (PMDB), in a solemn session in the Legislative Assembly of Maranh√£o, seat of the legislative power of Maranh√£o and later he was sent the position in ceremony open to the public in the Palace Of the Lions, in the equinoctial capital. In the fifteen days before Dino's inauguration, the administrative power instituted until then makes many changes in the structure of the State Government, following the resignation of Roseana Sarney (PMDB). He assumed the president of the Legislative Assembly of Maranh√£o, since the vice governor Washington also had already resigned to the vice-gobernadoria of the State. During this time, Arnaldo Melo, interim governor and responsible for the transition of power, re-inaugurated the Gin√°sio Costa Rodrigues (which had already been re-inaugurated by Roseana Sarney prior to her resignation but with unfinished works), and decorated herself and a further 144 personalities with the Medal of the Order of the Timbiras, the largest commendation given to a citizen by a chief of State of maranhense. In addition to having promoted, 28 new officers for the Military Police of the State of Maranh√£o, without having made public competition. Fl√°vio Dino was sworn in on January 1, 2015, at a public ceremony at the Palace of the Lions. In 2016, in the midst of the request of President Dilma Rousseff in the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, the governor of Maranh√£o, Fl√°vio Dino, launched, Along with other governors, a movement called \\"Network of Legality\\", against Dilma Rousseff's process of impeachment. Political leaders intended to use the Internet, more precisely social networks, to defend their opposition to the request. They created the \\"Coup Never Again\\" page on Facebook. The name was a reference to the project \\"Brazil Never Again\\", which denounced the crimes committed by the military dictatorship against its political opponents. According to the politicians cited, \\"impeachment\\" was a coup because the process violated the Constitution. Dilma did not have, according to them, direct participation in crimes of responsibility. Led by Dino, during a meeting with Dilma, sixteen governors signed the \\"Charter for Legality\\", contrary to the lawsuit. Later, sixteen mayors of capital joined the governors in that protest.

Newport was originally built as a steam-powered vessel, and used some of the components, including the boiler, from an earlier steamer, the T.M. Richardson. Although only a small wooden vessel, Newport, with the aid of an unpowered barge lashed alongside, transported as many as 500 passengers at a time on the short trip across Yaquina Bay. In 1914, to accommodate anticipated greater patronage of the rail line, Newport was converted to gasoline engine power.  Purpose  In 1908, the Newport-Yaquina route was purchased by Jack Fogarty and Capt. Oscar F. Jacobson from Capt. Chatterton. Fogarty and Jacobson were brothers-in-law, O.F. Jacobson being married to Julia Fogarty (d.1918), Jack Fogarty‚Äôs sister. Passengers bound for Newport, Agate Beach, Otter Rocks, Seal Rocks, Waldport, Tidewater and Yachats would arrive by rail at Yaquina City, Oregon. Baggage and cargo would be transferred from the train to the steamer by the train pulling out onto a pier and the baggage then being sent down a chute onto the steamer.  Construction and dimensions  The basic dimensions of Newport were and 81 gross tons. The boiler from the old steamer T.M. Richardson was to be placed in the new steamer, which was built at Yaquina City, Oregon to replace Richardson. Alternatively, the registered dimensions of the vessel, in 1909, were length, beam of , depth of hold of , 77 gross tons and 54 registered tons. Total crew required was three. The steam power plant generated 160 indicated horsepower. The official registration number was 205273. In February 1908, the Newport Navigation Company began preparing to build a new steamboat to be used on the run between Yaquina City, Oregon and Newport. The new boat would be built at Yaquina City, Oregon and would replace T.M. Richardson which had been on the route for the previous fifteen to twenty years. Construction was anticipated to begin soon after February 1908, and would be supervised by George Walker, a well-known boat builder. Newport was launched at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon of Wednesday, May 20, 1908. A large crowd was brought across the bay from Newport to witness the launch. Julia Jacobson, wife of one of the owners, spoke the words ‚ÄúI christen thee Newport‚Äù as she broke a bottle of wine over the bows. The new vessel was 78 feet long overall, with a beam of 16 feet. The boat was built for the Newport Navigation Company. The steamer Newport was taken out on a trial trip on Saturday, June 6, 1908.  Early operations  Newport on Yaquina Bay, with passenger barge Elk lashed alongside. On November 7, 1908, Newport came upriver to Toledo, Oregon from Newport city with the barge Elk. The barge was placed out of service for the winter, in fresh water at a mill owned by one Altree. Jack Fogarty was serving as engineer on the Newport in 1909, with George C. Walker as his relief. In mid-June, 1910, passengers arriving at Yaquina City for transport to Newport averaged over 50 daily, an unusually high number for that time of the year. Captain Jacobson, of the Newport, reported this to have been the heaviest June travel in his experience. Plans were being made for special railroad excursions for Independence Day celebrations in Newport. During peak travel times, generally during the summer vacation seasons, the passenger carrying capacity of Newport was augmented by lashing up alongside the steamer an unpowered barge, the Elk or the Julia. Elk, a scow with a cabin, was built in 1905 at Toledo, Oregon, was registered as an ‚Äúunrigged vessel‚Äù, of 97 gross and 94 net tons, with the official merchant registry number 162693. According to the official registry, four crewmen were required on board Elk. Newport with barge Julia lashed alongside. Built with a steamboat's hull, Julia was originally planned to be a powered vessel, but ended up being operated as an unpowered barge; the steamboat hull is clearly visible in this image. The Julia, at 53 gross and net tons, was built in 1912, at George C. Walker‚Äôs then new shipyard in Toledo. Julia was originally intended to be a powered steamboat, 85 feet long and 18 feet beam, but used as a barge for the first summer season after completion. No power plant was ever installed however, and Julia remained an unpowered barge. Like Elk, Julia was officially listed as an \\"unrigged vessel\\", but with a different official number, Julia was named after Captain Jacobson‚Äôs wife. Unlike the scow Elk, Julia was built with a river steamboat hull, allowing better speed to be made on excursions. Julia could carry 300 people. Reportedly Julia had ‚Äúgood seats and open decks.‚Äù  Large crowds at the Newport waterfront  On Sunday, July 24, 1910, Newport transported in one trip, 500 persons to the dock at the Newport waterfront. A crowd of 1,500 people gathered at the dock to greet the new arrivals. A city marshall, M.B. Grant, had to clear a path through the crowd to allow the disembarking passengers to cross the dock from the steamer to the street. While doing so, Grant encountered Howard Bush, a merchant from Summit, Oregon, and asked Bush to step back. Bush refused, struck Grant a blow on his nose with a fist, and knocked Grant to the ground. Bush continued to attack Grant while the marshall was on the ground. Another marshall, Blattener, pulled Bush off Grant. Grant then subdued Bush with three blows of the billy club to Grant‚Äôs head, lacerating him severely. Grant then arrested the by then submissive Bush, took him to jail, where his wounds were sewn up by a physician, Dr. Carter. Grant was charged with interfering with a police officer, and released on $100 cash bail with orders to appear before a justice of the peace the next morning.  Operations up to 1914  In mid-October 1911, Newport broke its propeller shaft. The boat was brought to Toledo for repairs, which were completed by October 20, 1911. The work was done by the Modern Improvement Company, of which George C. Walker, the relief captain of Newport, was a principal until January 2, 1912. The summer of 1913 was one of the busiest ever yet for tourism at Newport. As of August 4, 1913, over 3,500 persons had arrived at the city in the previous eight days. Overcrowded trains on the Southern Pacific line to Yaquina City were reported to be running an average of an hour late. It was said that the boiler on the Newport (which came from the condemned steamer T.M. Richardson) was too small for its engine. According to a newspaper report, ‚Äúthrongs, herded like cattle on boats and barges, pass about an hour on a ride of three minus and a half across the bay when compelled to go to restaurants.‚Äù Reportedly hundreds of passengers had complained to the railway or the steamboat company, but nothing had been done to improve things.  Band to greet passengers on arrival  In May 1913 plans were made to sponsor a local band in Newport, consisting then of 14 members, which among other things, would greet passengers arriving on the steamer Newport at the city dock. The band was under the direction of J.P. Fenwick. Motion pictures were shown in Newport on May 19 and 20, 1913, and the proceeds from the ticket sales were donated to the Newport band to buy new instruments and music so that the band could be expanded. Captain R.D. Morse, of the gasoline launch Ahwaneda (built in 1912), offered to turn over the proceeds of three or four excursion trips to support the band. In May, the plans were to meet the Newport on Sundays and three or four evenings during the week. The band also intended to give concerts at Nye Beach on Sunday afternoons during the summer.  Conversion to gasoline engine power  In January 1914, Capt. Oscar F. Jacobson travelled to Portland, Oregon where he purchased a 110 horse power Western Standard gasoline engine, which he intended to install in time for the next summer season. The Newport Navigation Company, owners of the vessel, decided to make to the conversion in anticipation of increased patronage due to the improvement of the Corvallis & Eastern‚Äôs rail line to Yaquina, by the addition of ballast and the laying of heavier rail. The engine arrived at Toledo in early March, 1914. Work on installing the new power plant began on the morning of March 6, 1914, when the steamer arrived at Toledo from Newport. The new machinery was reported to be able to double the power of the vessel, and \\"greatly increase her efficiency in transporting the passengers from Yaquina to Newport during the big Summer rushes. The travel time from Yaquina to Newport was expected to be reduced by ten minutes. Running time would then be down to 15 minutes. The steamer was then owned by the Newport Navigation Company. George C. Walker, an experienced Yaquina Bay steamboat man and boatbuilder, who by then was living in California, was requested by telegraph to return to Yaquina City to supervise the work. The gasoline- powered Truant, itself a converted steamer, would replace Newport while the conversion was underway. The work was nearing completion on March 27, 1914. On Thursday, April 2, 1914, the Newport returned to the lower Yaquina Bay from Toledo, under power from the new gasoline engine. With the conversion of Newport to gasoline power, there were no longer any steam-driven vessels operating on Yaquina Bay. Because of the increased speed due to the new engine, Newport was able to adjust its schedule, departing the Newport waterfront for Yaquina City at 7:00 a.m. daily, rather than the previous time of 6:45 a.m. The schedule change took effect on April 22, 1914.  Later operations  John Marshall, president of the Newport Navigation Company, at age 84 in 1919. In the parade of boats held on July 4, 1914, Newport and the barge Julia won first prize for decoration. According to a newspaper report, ‚Äúthe Newport and the royal barge, Julia were beautifully and elaborately decorated with bunting, flags and chinese lanterns, making a most beautiful and brilliant experience. On Sunday, July 19, 1914, over 1000 people travelled on the railroad between Albany, Oregon and Yaquina City. Two trains arrived and three trains departed from Yaquina City. To accommodate the traffic, Newport made five trips that Sunday, with the barge Julia, between Yaquina City and the Newport waterfront. In April 1918, repairs to Newport were completed at the Anderson Boat Works at Toledo, Oregon. The barge Julia was hauled out for repairs shortly after the work was complete on Newport. In March 1920, John ‚ÄúJohnny‚Äù Marshall, president of the Newport Navigation Company, visited Newport to inspect Newport, which was then operating between South Beach and Yaquina City. Marshall was then 82 years of age, and was probably the most senior of the steamboat men then living. Marshall had been friends with a number of historical figures, including Ulysses S. Grant, whom he had visited in the White House, and generals Hooker and George B. McClellan. Marshall had served as engineer on a number of well-known vessels on the Columbia and Willamette rivers, including Enterprise (1855), Wide West, Hassalo, Senator, and Willamette Chief. In June 1920, the rail service to Yaquina City, and the processing of detraining and boarding the Newport, came under newspaper criticism. Only one train per day was now running, and the cargo transfer facilities had deteriorated, with the pier that once supported the train having rotted partially away. In March 1922, Newport was undergoing repairs at Toledo, at the Altree shipyard. The work included an overhaul, repaint, with new guard rails and the addition of some new timbers. The schooner Sea Foam was placed on the run temporarily while Newport was out of service. Newport was scheduled to be back on the run on Wednesday, March 30, 1922.  Disposition  Newport continued to be registered as a passenger vessel in 1922‚Äì1923, although the gross tonnage of the vessel was now reported as 81. Newport was listed as abandoned in the 1930 registry of merchant vessels.  Relic  As of 2013, the wheel of the Newport was in the possession of the Lincoln County Historical Society and on exhibit.

Formerly operating as Booth Memorial Hospital and New York Hospital Queens (NYHQ), it is located on the northeast corner of Main Street and Booth Memorial Avenue. The NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Healthcare System had assumed control of the Booth Memorial Hospital until 2015, when the NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital, headquartered in Manhattan, assumed control and made the Booth Memorial Hospital a Queens campus. History The hospital began as a non-profit hospital in Manhattan operated by the Salvation Army called Booth Memorial Hospital and Medical Center, one of several Salvation Army hospitals around the United States to bear the name. It was named after Salvation Army founder William Booth. It was originally opened in 1892 as a rescue home for women, particularly unmarried mothers, located at East 123rd Street in East Harlem. After several location changes, it was moved to 312‚Äì20 East 15th Street (also referred to as 314 and 316 East 15th Street) on the East Side in the 1910s in a joint venture with the American Red Cross, when it was officially named Booth Memorial Hospital. It was licensed as a general-care hospital in 1918. The facility was expanded throughout the decade, officially dedicated on March 13, 1919. It was located across from Stuyvesant Square, at the site of the modern Mount Sinai Beth Israel hospital. Groundbreaking ceremonies on the hospital's current location in Queensboro Hill, in Flushing, occurred on June 24, 1954. The Salvation Army moved the hospital due to lack of medical facilities in the burgeoning borough of Queens, and after failing to develop the former New York Orthopedic Hospital in Midtown, on East 59th Street and First Avenue just south of the Queensboro Bridge, into a replacement. It was dedicated and opened on February 5, 1957. Built at a cost of $4.8 million, this modern facility featured 210 beds at the time of its opening. The hospital was accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals in 1958. Around this time, North Hempstead Turnpike was renamed Booth Memorial Avenue. The former Manhattan site was purchased by the New York Infirmary. The women's rescue home was moved to a wing in the new hospital, called the Perkins Pavilion. Booth Memorial became affiliated with the New York University School of Medicine. In 1992, the hospital was purchased from the Salvation Army by New York Hospital in Manhattan, becoming New York Hospital Queens in May 1993. After New York Hospital merged with Presbyterian Hospital in 1997, it became part of the NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Healthcare System. For a period of time in the 1990s, the hospital managed nearby Flushing Hospital Medical Center, the oldest hospital in the borough, due to financial struggles. After Booth Memorial considered closing the neighbor hospital, the latter was transferred by United States bankruptcy court to Jamaica Hospital in March 1999, and Flushing Hospital emerged from bankruptcy in June 2000. In February 2015, New York‚ÄìPresbyterian announced plans to assume full control of New York Hospital Queens. On July 1, 2015, the complex was renamed NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian/Queens, making it New York‚ÄìPresbyterian's first Queens campus and its sixth campus overall. Despite the 1993 name change, many local residents continue to refer to NYPQ as \\"Booth.\\" Facilities The hospital is located on a large block bound by Main Street, Booth Memorial Avenue, 141st Street, and 56th Avenue. It consists of five multi-story buildings, with a parking lot located across Booth Memorial Avenue. The main entrance and lobby are located on Main Street at the southwest end of the block, while the emergency entrance is located on Booth Memorial. The only non-hospital structure on the block is a Speedway LLC filling station (formerly branded as a Hess Corporation station) on the northwest corner, which is currently being demolished and turned into a parking lot. In 1999, a major modernization project took place, adding 200 beds to the hospital. A second major expansion of the facility was approved by Queens Community Board 7 in September 2006, leading to the construction of the current lobby building and a new West Wing building. Groundbreaking on the project took place on February 9, 2007. The West Wing opened in 2010. A new parking garage, either on the current parking lot or on property taken from nearby Kissena Corridor Park, was proposed, but has yet to be constructed. In 2012, the hospital installed a half-acre of green roof with funding from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. In addition to the main facility, several other facilities, including primary and specialty care facilities, are located across Queens, particularly in nearby Flushing and Fresh Meadows. Transportation The hospital is served by the , , and buses, which run along Main Street. The closest subway station is Flushing-Main Street at Roosevelt Avenue in Downtown Flushing, served by the .

Biography Born in Egypt, Lebanese artist Mouna Bassili Sehnaoui attended the American University of Beirut and the University of Arizona, where she studied Fine Arts. Sehnaoui works in a variety of formats ranging from painting, writing, design and sculpture. She has had solo exhibitions in Paris, Dubai, and Beirut. Sehnaoui currently lives and works in Beirut with husband Marwan, President of the Lebanese Order of Malta and sons Salim Sehnaoui and Khalil Sehnaoui. In the seventies, Bassili Sehnaoui was in charge of the Graphic Art Department of the Lebanese National Council of Tourism. She also produced designs for stamps, packaging, posters, and book illustrations and created films for the Lebanese public television station. She later learned painting and typography, two disciplines she taught in Lebanese universities. Her style is influenced by a Middle Eastern cultural heritage as reflected in the flat treatment of colours in both Byzantine icons and Persian miniatures. The treatment of space is very personal and brings a new dimension to a figurative approach by the use of hieroglyphic ‚Äìlike symbols and ‚Äúwindows‚Äù that open to reveal an added aspect of the subject treated. Since the early nineties, she has produced albums of lithographs based on Phoenician legends and studied porcelain painting, while still working as a designer and illustrator. Bassili Sehnaoui has been exhibiting art since the mid-sixties. Her seemingly na√Øve paintings most often reference her own surroundings, her country and its cultural heritage. The works suggest a very personal interpretation of space where shapes and line interpenetrate in colourful harmonies. Work Her work has won several Prizes and figures in the Museum of Prints, Alexandria; the Sursock Museum, Beirut; the Art Collection of the American University of Beirut; the Bank Audi Art Collection as well as many private collections around the world. Sehnaoui also designed the famous Lebanon logo, now widely used, for the Ministry of Culture in the 1960s, as well as several posters encouraging tourism in the country.

It was built from 1866 to 1890s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 December 2005. History Sugar cane juice train Doolbi to Yengarie Queensland, early 1890s The ruins of the Central Sugar Mill, overlooking the Mary River at Yengarie, are the remains of an industrial complex that was constructed in 1866 as a purpose built sugar mill and refinery. It serviced many sugar plantations in the area before closing in the late 1890s. Sugar cane had been first brought to Australia in 1788 but subsequent plantings at Sydney, Port Macquarie and Norfolk Island failed to be commercially viable. Captain Louis Hope grew a cane crop successfully in Queensland in 1862. By 1864 the first commercial sugar mill in Australia had been established by him at Ormiston and interest in growing sugar cane spread rapidly. By the end of the decade cane was being cultivated further north at Maryborough, Mackay and Bundaberg, where the warmer climate proved more suitable for cane growing. In 1862 John Buhot, originally from Barbados, in the West Indies, experimentally produced sugar granules from cane grown in the Brisbane Botanical Gardens, demonstrating its potential as a commercial crop in Queensland. A number of farmers were interested in growing cane, but little was known about its cultivation in local conditions, or about the production of sugar. In October 1864, Buhot came to Maryborough to purchase plants from John Eaton who was growing an experimental cane crop. While there, he gave a lecture at the School of Arts on the cultivation and manufacture of sugar to a large audience. While in Maryborough, Buhot also trialled sugar production from some of Eaton's crop with promising results. Eaton and others formed the Maryborough Sugar Company in August 1865 and purchased at Tinana for a plantation and mill. Several blocks were under cane by 1865 and the first crop was crushed by primitive methods producing a coarse yellow sugar. Local timber millers Frederick Gladwell and Robert Greathead decided to construct a central mill that would process cane from a number of surrounding farms. Buhot was engaged to design the mill complex and supervise the production of sugar. In July 1866 tender notices were placed in the Maryborough Chronicle for the manufacture of 50,000 bricks for mill buildings and for the erection of a \\"New Sugar Manufactory\\". John Murray undertook the brickwork, stone flooring was quarried locally and machinery was obtained from Sydney. By September, wharves were constructed on the riverbank below the refinery in order to accommodate sugar cane punts. Vessels carrying goods to and from the Central Mill also used the wharves. A large cutting was made in the riverbank for a rail line between the mill and the river. This was operated by a rope and windlass to transport goods and equipment up and down the embankment. Written agreements were obtained from local farmers regarding the supply of cane. It was a major commitment by both the partners and the farmers producing the \\"new\\" crop. Unfortunately, an accident in October 1866 damaged the machinery and a boiler, which delayed crushing until February 1867. The late crush produced low sugar content and a very dark sugar. The enterprise experienced difficulties due to the small scale of the refinery, primitive equipment and inexperience. Although by September 1867 a fine light brown sugar was being produced, the problems of the business were compounded by an explosion and by a labour shortage caused by the discovery of gold at Gympie. In October the mill was operating night and day, but by November, it had closed due to financial problems. The Australian Joint Stock Bank foreclosed on the mortgage and plant from the operation was sold at auction in Sydney in December 1867. Sale notices itemised a steam engine and boiler, evaporating pans, two large hardwood cane punts, a trolley with iron wheels with ratchet, a Cornish boiler and a tramway from the wharf. The Central Mill was sold to John Meiklejohn who expanded the capacity of the mill and installed more modern equipment including centrifugals instead of the old-fashioned drainage boxes. He also installed a still for manufacturing rum that was in operation from July 1868. His first season produced a fine dry yellow sugar and by 1869 of rum also. In early November 1868 the Maryborough Chronicle reported that the mill's end of season production was estimated to be of sugar and 75 hogsheads of rum. The first shipment of locally produced rum left Maryborough on 11 November when 19 hogsheads from the Central Mill and of sugar left on board the Saxonia for Sydney. In 1869/1870 William Gibson, who had operated a sugar mill near Brisbane, purchased the Central Mill, which he ran until the mid 1880s. However, by 1877 the Central was operating only as a juice mill, crushing growers' cane and delivering the juice to the nearby Yengarie Refinery. This had been established by Tooth & Cran in 1867 and was upgraded in 1871 to be a large modern refinery producing a high quality white sugar. The 1890s brought problems due to depressed sugar prices and major changes in the sugar industry. Central mills servicing independent white farmers replaced the big plantations run by indentured labour, licenses to recruit Melanesian workers having ceased after December 1890. A number of plantations and mills closed and, by 1892, it was reported that much of the land along the Mary River was no longer under cultivation, or was growing crops other than sugar. Cran purchased the Central Mill in the early 1890s but a major flood in 1893 damaged plantations and farms along the river and caused severe damage to the mill and to Yengarie Refinery. This closed in 1899 and the Central Mill was taken over by the Kersnovske family, becoming the Central Plantation. The family continued to grow sugar cane and later operated the property as a dairy farm. In more recent times, up to 5000 head of beef cattle have been grazed on the property. The Central Mill structures gradually fell into disrepair and now comprise one intact chimney and the base of another, remains of structures, vats and tanks and a dam and tramway formation. Several other related sites survive in the Yengarie area, including the Yengarie Sugar Refinery Ruins. Description The Central Mill ruins are located on the banks of the Mary River about southwest of Maryborough. The major visible built features on the site are: * Two large fig trees apart, which were planted at the entrance to the mill site * Holding tank, a brick lined holding tank with a diameter of * Ruins of manager's house, washed away in 1893 * Mill chimneystack, square in plan and constructed of red bricks with arched openings to the east and west at ground level. It has stone foundations * A section of stone mill flooring * An underground metal storage tank, recently filled with rubble * A rectangular metal juice tank measuring constructed of riveted iron plates, in front of a rubble stone wall * A lime slagheap wide. Beside this are the remains of a stone base, possibly from a small chimneystack or furnace. A range of metal artefacts is located in the immediate area including rings and pipes. * A tramway cutting between the first river terrace and the riverbank where the jetty once was, which has been obscured by vegetation. Heritage listing Central Sugar Mill Ruins was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 December 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The ruins of the Central Sugar Mill are evidence for an early industrial enterprise that made an important contribution to the development of the sugar industry in Queensland. The sugar industry has been of great importance to the development of Queensland for its contribution to the economy and to the pattern of European settlement. The Yengarie area was the site of some of the earliest sugar plantations and mills in Queensland. The Central Mill was one of the earliest places in Maryborough to produce sugar and crushed cane from many small farms, foreshadowing the later importance of central mills to the development of the sugar industry in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Central Plantation Sugar Mill ruins are rare as an early sugar mill, refinery and distillery in Queensland. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The ruins of the Central Plantation Sugar Mill have the potential to reveal further information about the operation of the sugar industry in Queensland in the 19th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The remains include characteristic features of a sugar mill and refinery including chimneys, underground vats, partial formations of a cane tramway and a dam which illustrate the processes involved See also * List of tramways in Queensland References=Attribution=External links Queensland Heritage Register Yengarie, Queensland Articles incorporating text from the Queensland Heritage Register Sugar mills in Queensland ","title":"Central Sugar Mill Ruins"},{"id":"48466472","text":"was a Japanese actress.

Early life Alcorn was born in Hokitika on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island in 1866 to Samuel Wesley and Jane Alcorn (born Andrews). Samuel and Jane had emigrated to Dunedin from Ireland, married there in 1865, and then moved to the West Coast. She had seven younger siblings: Margaret, Ethel, Olive, Winifred, John, William and Kathleen. Samuel was a draper in Hokitika but in 1874 the family moved to Wellington. Samuel bought property in the city on Lambton Quay opposite the department store Kirkcaldie & Stains. He opened a draper shop downstairs and the family lived upstairs. The drapery business was successful, and the Alcorn children enjoyed a prosperous household with a governess and private schools. This life changed dramatically, however, in 1877 when a fire in the shop destroyed the business and killed a younger daughter of the family, Winifred, aged four. The family moved to Ashburton and the children attended school there. Mary worked as a shop assistant after finishing her schooling. Mary had a great love of music; she played the piano at concerts such as a Wakanui fundraising concert in 1893 and also sang in the church choir at the Ashburton Wesleyan Church. She and her sisters were also accomplished seamstresses, winning prizes at school competitions for their lacework, embroidery and crewelwork. Business  In 1906, Alcorn and her sister Margaret opened a shop in the new Kennedy Building on Lambton Quay, Wellington called \\"Liberty's Wellington\\", specialising in art furniture and furnishings, and started selling goods they imported themselves from Liberty department store in London. The sisters also offered professional advice and design ideas for their customers' homes. Window display at \\"Liberty's Wellington\\", ca 1932 Mary and Margaret lived in Oriental Bay and Mary cycled to the shop each day, which was not a common way for women to travel at the time. Mary extended the business by travelling to England and Europe in 1913 to select goods for the shop herself. She visited potters in Florence and pewter works in Birmingham, and also visited Royal Doulton and Wedgwood pottery firms as well as making several visits to Liberty's. In the early 1920s the Alcorns' shop expanded into larger premises further along Lambton Quay, taking over Thomas Pringle's embroidery shop and business. At this time the Alcorns also hired a local artist and embroiderer, Marjory Mills, to design embroidery patterns for their shop. Mary died in 1928 and is buried in a family plot at the Bolton Street Cemetery. Mary's sister Margaret opened a second shop in Burlington Arcade (pictured) after Mary's death, and managed both shops until they failed in the 1930s due to the Depression.

He represented a militant strand of Catholicism and was instrumental in the building of the St Charles Church (Karlskirche) in Volders. He was also an instigator of the Andreas Oxner Anti-semitism cult. Life Guarinonius was born in Trent, then a powerful bishopric. His father, Bartolomeo Guearinius, the son of a physician and the grandson of a goldsmith, was called away to Vienna soon after the boy's birth, to take up a post as a physician at the court of Emperor Maximillian II. The mother of Guaronius, Catharina Pellegrini, came from an established Trent family, but due to family opposition his parents, though married, were not married to each other, which made Hippolytus Guarinonius illegitimate. Issues regarding his birth status would be retrospectively resolved in 1618, however, when Pope Paul V declared that his parents had been married to each other. Despite reports to the contrary, Hippolytus Guarinonius himself later recorded that he spent the first eleven years of his life growing up in Vienna till his father relocated to Prague in 1583, still a court physician, but now working for a new emperor, Rudolf II. In Prague Guarinonius received an intensive and formative education as one of approximately 150 boarders at the Jesuit Gymnasium (secondary school). Between 1593 and 1597 he studied Medicine at the University of Padua, where he qualified as a doctor in 1598. Directly following his studies he may have worked as a doctor in Trent (sources differ) but in or before 1601 he relocated to Hall in Tirol, then an important administrative city in the Habsburg territories, some 180 km (110 miles) to the north of Trent. One of his early appointments at Hall in Tirol came in 1601 when he was appointed Municipal Physician, which was a public appointment. In 1607 he was appointed :de:Leibarztpersonal physician to the Archducesses Eleanor and Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria, Habsburg siblings who had retreated to a monastic existence in the town following the disastrous marriage of one of them. In 1611‚Äì12 the town was hit by plague (probably bacterial typhus) and Guarinonius moved out of the town centre, but he encouraged the construction of medical huts where plague victims could be accommodated in slightly more sanitary conditions, paying particular attention to preventive measures, attending to the operation of the mineral springs and encouraging physical health and exercise. He also coined the phrase, \\"Achtung auf die Natur und zur√ºck zu ihr, Ma√ühalten in jedem!\\"\\"Achtung auf die Natur und zur√ºck zu ihr, Ma√ühalten in jedem!\\" (loosely: \\"Watch out for Nature and respect her: Moderation in all things!\\").Josef Hirn: Erzherzog Maximilian der Deutschmeister, Innsbruck 1915/36, p. 459. A singular passion for Guarinonius was the strengthening and updating of Catholicism. This won him plaudits in conservative circles but also made him a controversial figure for the town council and for other fellow citizens, some of whom founds Guarinonius an unscrupulous tactician. Sometimes his fanaticism was too much even for his Jesuit mentors. In 1611 his behaviour was robustly denounced‚ÄûMein Gott, was hebt der guete Dr. Guarinoni nit an! W√§re wol besser, er bliebe bey seiner Fakult√§t!\\" to the Archduke by the Bolzano theosophist, Adam Haslmayr. Haslmayr's intemperate outburst earned him a punishing stretch as a Genoa galley slave, although he survived the experience.: Fr√ºhes Wissen. Auf der Suche nach vormodernen Wissensformen in Bozen und Tirol. In: Hans Karl Peterlini (Ed.): Universitas Est. Bd. I: Essays zur Bildungsgeschichte in Tirol/S√ºdtirol vom Mittelalter bis zur Freien Universit√§t Bozen. Bozen: Bozen/Bolzano University Press 2008, pp. 35‚Äì87 (notably 44‚Äì47) Guarinonius directed the construction of the Karlskirche in Volders, which was built according to his own design. \\"Die Grewel der Verw√ºstung menschlichen Geschlechts\\" title page From 1620 till his death Guarinonius directed the construction of the St Charles Church (Karlskirche) in Volders, which was built according to his own design. He was also responsible for the construction of several other religious buildings. At the same time, Guarinonius continued to publish medical and religious texts during this period. In 1628 he was authorized by , the Bishop of Brixen, to \\"catechize\\" in the mountain villages as a Catholic lay preacher (Laientheologe). He thus became what he himself termed a \\"secular Jesuit\\" (\\"weltlicher Jesuiter\\"). He interpreted his role not merely as that of a preacher of morality and discipline, but as a one-man vice-squad. Everywhere he looked he saw frivolity and \\"beastliness\\" (\\"L√ºderlichkeit\\"). His condemnations were unrelentingly harsh. Possibly because of his strenuous efforts for the public good, the Emperor Ferdinand II appointed him to an honorific court medical post (Erzarzt von und zu Hoffberg und Volderthurn), while the pope made him a Vatican Knight of the Golden Spur. Family Hippolytus Guarinonius was married twice. His first wife, Charitas Thaler, bore him eight children, including one set of triplets who died shortly after their births, and underwent an emergency baptism in which each received the name, Christina followed by one of the virtues identified in Verse 13, Chapter 13 of the Apostle's First Epistle to the Corinthians (Christina Fides, Christina Spes and Christina Charitas). Two years after the death, in 1610, of his first wife he married again. His second wife, Helena von Spie√ü, bore him two further sons. Another source states merely that he had many children, most of whom died young. The Architect and Master Builder The St Charles Church (Karlskirche) in Volders represents a dramatic physical manifestation of Guarinonius's religious zeal. It was constructed according to his own plans, and is today easily accessible from the motorway service area on the Inn Valley Autobahn (direction Kufstein). The church, built in the style sometimes described as \\"Venetian Baroque\\", exhibits an almost oriental flamboyance: it is one of the most important sacred buildings in what remains of the Austrian Tirol. The floor-plan of the building is modelled on that of St. Peter's in Rome. Guarinonius funded the church's construction from his personal wealth, and progress was frequently interrupted when the money ran out. It was completed only on 25 July 1654, more than 34 years after the placing of the foundation stone on 2 April 1620. He died at the end of May 1654, soon after the completion of the church, and two months before its formal consecration He was himself buried at the Karlskirche, where his body lies beneath a marble slab before the steps of the \\"Epiphany alter\\", together with that of his wife and two of his sons. Guarinonius also instigated the building of the Stiftsalm ChapelThe Stiftsalm is a mountain in Voldertal and the Borgia Chapel in Volderwald (Tulfes). The chapel at the Volderer Wildbad has burned down several ties, and the present structure therefore only goes back to Guarinonius indirectly. On the far side of the Inn Valley, the plans for the little church dedicated to St Anna in Baumkirchen were probably also drawn up by Guarinonius. The Writer Guarinonius contribution as a writer on medical and religious topics is seen by some as even more notable than his architecture and building work. His most important written work, of which the initial volume was published in Ingolstadt in 1610, was entitled \\"Die Grewel der Verw√ºstung menschlichen Geschlechts\\", a seven volume work which, by its content and structure, defies any simple classification. Topics include doctors and apothecaries, the ducking of women, digestion, mountains and plains, eaters and stuffers, Engadine comedies, calendar discrepancies, anecdotes about Eulenspiegel, foxes' tails, fencing schools. Other subjects are German dog laws, how Jews and heretics love to devour meat, praise for older women, a peon of praise for guardians, rubbish and associated crime, the nature of geese and women, noodles and polenta eaten by peasants, and much more. Though its subject selection and format may appear haphazard, the \\"Grewel\\" is nevertheless a treasure trove for German philology and vernacular. It is particularly valued by scholars for insights it provides into unknown regional idioms and provincial colloquial expressions hitherto not traced to any form of written source. It is rich in allusions to contemporary German- language proverbs, speech patterns and word-play. Of all his medical publications, \\"Pestilentz Guardien\\" (Plague recommendations), which was published following two years of an epidemic locally, became particularly widely known. This \\"minor treatise\\" like the \\"Grewel\\" before it, appeared in seven volumes. These are entitled as follows: # Recommendations for healthy people (\\" Guardi f√ºr den gesunden Menschen\\") # Recommendations for priests, nurses and grave diggers (\\"... f√ºr Priester, Krankenw√§rter und Todtengr√§ber\\") # Recommendations for infected homes (\\"... f√ºr die infizierten H√§user\\") # Recommendations for cemeteries (\\"... f√ºr die Friedh√∂fe\\") # Recommendations for clothing and bedding (\\"... f√ºr Kleider und W√§sche\\") # Recommendations against diverse errors (\\"... gegen verschiedene Irrt√ºmer\\") # Recommendations for people suffering salt and brine burn injuries (\\"... f√ºr Leute, die von der ‚ÄûSalzsur‚Äú (Salzlauge) gesch√§digt und verbrannt wurden\\") Also worth mentioning are his botanical publications that include \\"Hydrooeconomgania\\" and \\"Chylosophiae academicae artis Aesculapiae novis astris illustratae tomi duo\\" which appeared respectively in 1640 and 1648. The Botanist A herbarium assembled by Guarinonius was gifted by the Wilten Foundation to the Tyrolean State Museum in 1876. It is one of the earliest collections of this nature in central Europe. Compiled between 1610 and 1630, it comprises a book format herbarium with wooden covers and bevelled edges. It starts with a 13-page Latin/German index, which is followed by 106 pages incorporating 633 pressed and dried plant parts, originally collected in the Innsbruck area.

Made by the BBC in 2005, it was filmed in the city of Arkhangelsk.  Plot  An English expert on Soviet history, Dr. ChristopherHe reveals his name at the press conference for Josef. 'Fluke' Kelso (Daniel Craig), is in Moscow for an academic conference on Joseph Stalin. After the conference, Papu Rapava, an old man, says that he has important information for Dr. Kelso. In Hotel Ukraine, where Kelso is staying, Rapava recounts in detail how he, as a young security guard in 1953, witnessed the death of Stalin. He saw Lavrentiy Beria steal a key from Stalin as he lay dying in his Middle dacha. Beria and Rapava drove to Stalin's private quarters in the Kremlin and Beria opened a safe. In the safe was a red folder which Beria removed and later placed in a metal tool box at his mansion. He instructed Rapava to dig a hole in the yard in which this box was buried. Believing this folder to contain Stalin's notebook, Kelso sees this as an opportunity to write a book based on the personal writings of the late Soviet leader. He tells Rapava that it would be worth a lot of money and would help Rapava reconcile with his estranged daughter. Rapava leaves while Kelso's attention is elsewhere. The next day, a reporter called RJ O'Brian (Gabriel Macht) turns up and recognises Kelso. Kelso begins his research in earnest, visiting a library to get information and eyewitness accounts of Stalin's death. He engages with a young librarian, Yelena, who provides him with the address where Beria used to live. Kelso goes to Beria's former mansion, now in a state of disrepair. By accident, he discovers the key Beria took from Stalin. He finds the yard has already been excavated and the box is gone. He visits Vladimir Mamantov (Lev Prygunov), a powerful politician (and former KGB agent) who leads the Communist Aurora movement. Kelso invites Mamantov to talk about the notebook, but Mamantov denies knowledge of it. Kelso leaves, unconvinced by Mamantov's denial. Soon Kelso becomes aware that he is being followed. Coming across a matchbook in his hotel room, Kelso goes to the advertised night club. Again he meets O'Brian. Kelso has asked to speak with Rapava's daughter, Zinaida (Yekaterina Rednikova), who works as a high-class prostitute to fund her law studies. He asks to speak with her father again and, after Kelso agrees to pay for her assistance, she takes him to her father's apartment block. Kelso finds Rapava murdered in the bathtub. As he is leaving, Kelso is mugged and beaten by hooligans. Despite Kelso's appeals for help from the police, he ends up being detained as a suspect. The FSB soon become involved as they are interested in what Kelso is doing. They arrange for him to be released without charge. The agent in charge, Suvorin, introduces himself, revealing that Kelso's actions led to the death of Rapava. Mamantov was aware of only one witness who knew about the notebook. Suvorin advises Kelso to leave Russia. Zinaida tracks down Kelso. She found a note from her father telling her that Kelso has information for her. She tells him of their estrangement and asks why her father would contact her after so many years. When she says that she doesn't want to speak to her father, Kelso has to break the news to her that Rapava is dead. She takes Kelso to an old garage owned by her father in a search for more clues. Kelso finds a Makarov pistol and the tool box but before they can look inside, O'Brian turns up again. O'Brian wants a share of what they have found. In the tool box is the journal of a young woman called Anoushka from Archangel, who was selected to work for high- ranking Communist Party officials in Moscow. Zinaida translates Anoushka's writings and learns that the woman took care of Stalin. She writes of a different, humbler aspect to Stalin, different than the brutal dictatorial nature he demonstrated to others. One night she observes his cruelty when she sees that he forces officials to dance for him. After this, she voluntarily dances for Stalin. Pages have been torn from the journal. O'Brian presses Kelso on the book's authenticity. Kelso is convinced it is genuine. Other papers found in the red folder contain reports from the NKVD and medical records. From other information known from that time, they conclude that Anoushka may have been the mother to an heir of Stalin. O'Brian deduces that the story continues in Archangel and makes plans for them to travel. When O'Brian leaves the room, Kelso and Zinaida plot to leave him behind and travel to Archangel together. Zinaida plans a brief stop at her apartment to get her savings. An intruder waits inside but they make their escape and continue travelling north. Angered by their betrayal, O'Brian discusses his own travel plans with his colleague, Louise. Suvorin confronts Mamantov about Rapava's murder at a book signing, but Mamantov has a watertight alibi. Suvorin's boss is outraged at O'Brian's breaking news report about Stalin's secret notebook. He orders Suvorin to talk with O'Brian. Reaching Archangel, Kelso asks at the local records office about past party members. A male clerk, Tsarev, tells them that Anoushka's mother is still alive and living locally. Kelso and Zinaida leave the records office, returning to their hotel. As they are getting closer, Kelso notices two policemen checking O'Brian's car and the pair are chased. Just before the police catch them, a car arrives and an assassin fatally shoots both policemen. Returning to the hotel unmolested, Kelso and Zinaida discover O'Brian waiting. Meanwhile, Suvorin is questioning Louise about O'Brian and she gives him the information he wants. At the home of Anoushka's mother, it is revealed that Anoushka returned home pregnant, and died two days after she gave birth. Her baby boy was adopted by a local couple who lived in the forest. In Moscow, Suvorin is again summoned to speak with his boss. Plans to have the military transport Suvorin to Archangel are under way. His boss cites the reasons for the importance of the notebook. Kelso questions O'Brian about his sources and how he always seems to find them. Kelso appears suspicious of O'Brian's answer. When Zinaida comes out of the house to smoke a cigarette, she and Kelso discuss what they know. Zinaida agrees to remain with the mother so that Kelso and O'Brian can travel in order to find the child, now a man. Kelso also wants to keep an eye on O'Brian. The mother has revealed that her husband once tried to find his grandson. He left the house but never returned. Kelso and Zinaida believe that Anoushka met the same fate. While the men are away, the local police arrive at the house and arrest Zinaida for murdering the two policemen. Before they arrest her, she manages to hide her father's Makarov pistol and some money. Kelso and O'Brian begin their journey but fall foul of a road trap which stops the car. As they review their predicament, a man watches them from a nearby hill. Kelso is convinced the man is Josef, Stalin's son by Anoushka. They agree to go with him to prove they are not a threat to him. Suvorin arrives by helicopter and gets an update from Lev, the local Militsiya captain. Suvorin examines the dead policemen and concludes that it was an execution carried out by a hitman and not a \\"call girl\\" or a \\"history professor\\"Translated by on screen captions. He asks to speak with Zinaida. Suvorin assures her that she will not be hurt by the Militsiya as he has established that she did not kill the two policemen. At a remote cabin, Kelso and O'Brian are presented with a large suitcase. On opening it, they discover relics from the past that belonged to Stalin as well as identity papers of others who came before them. These people wrote confessions and died. An old man who chops logs for Josef states that Josef's time is nearing. Kelso asks Josef about his adoptive parents. The father, when drunk, would beat Josef. He died falling into one of his own traps while drunk and the mother was too old to work. Josef suggests that he killed the woman as a kindness. Kelso offers Josef a photograph of his birth mother but Josef says that he has picture of his real father and they are enough. Josef plies the men with vodka. In a menacing tone, Josef encourages Kelso and O'Brian to dance for him, just as his father did. The next morning, Kelso awakes to discover Josef has gone. He and O'Brian make their way to the car to get a message out. Elsewhere, Suvorin is met by Major Kretov, with a squad of Russian Special Forces. Their mission is not immediately evident but Suvorin joins them. Finally O'Brian manages to get a signal with his satellite communications device and he begins a broadcast from the forest. Kelso tries to stop him and they struggle. The special forces arrive at the cabin and kill the old man. Kretov is aware of the satellite transmission by O'Brian and he informs Suvorin. Josef kills a guard left by the special forces transport. Soldiers capture Kelso and O'Brian and bring them to Kretov. Suvorin makes a move to protect the two men by threatening to kill Kretov. Kretov reveals that even if he is killed, his men will kill Kelso and O'Brian. Suddenly, the group comes under attack from Josef. Suvorin orders Kelso and O'Brian to run for their lives. Suvorin accompanies them but Kretov shoots him in the back as they make their escape. O'Brian is caught in a bear trap and Kelso helps him remove it. Kretov kills the limping O'Brian. Kelso falls into a nearby river and takes refuge under the dock. Kretov runs onto the dock and raises his weapon just as Josef shoots him. Kelso escapes in a small motorboat. Back at the cabin, Josef shaves and dresses, producing a striking resemblance to his father. Kelso reaches a harbour and gets a lift in a truck to the mother's house. He learns that Zinaida is with the Militsiya. The old woman gives him Rapava's Makarov pistol. Kelso finds Zinaida at the police station. He pays Lev a huge bribe for her release. Kelso tells her that they must travel to the Kremlin because Mamantov wants Kelso alive. En route to the train, they watch O'Brian's broadcast on a television set in front of a small crowd. On the train, Kelso tells Zinaida that Mamantov wants a credible person to reveal Anoushka's notebook and the existence of Josef. He tells her that Papu Rapava died because he wanted Zinaida to have the wealth from the notebook to stop her prostitution. Kelso tells her they will go to the American embassy in Moscow and he invites her to go with him to New York. She confesses that her father never held or loved his children. He taught her and her brother to be tough, never show fear and only trust themselves. As they settle down in a compartment for the rest of their journey, the assassin shows up and demands the notebook. He takes Kelso to see Mamantov. Mamantov explains how he planned for Kelso to come to Moscow to speak at the conference, discover the notebook and reveal Josef to Russia. Kelso believes Josef to be unstable and that Mamantov might be his first victim. A hand resting on Mamantov's shoulder is Josef's and Mamantov believes Josef supports him. Back in the compartment, Kelso tells Zinaida about his meeting with Mamantov and that they must get off at Vologda, the next station. As they are pulling in to the station, a huge crowd is there to greet the arrival of Josef. Kelso tells her to go to Moscow and get on a plane to anywhere. He is going to authenticate the notebook for Mamantov. He meets Louise and tells her that O'Brian is dead. Kelso wants her cameraman to broadcast his speech and he begins to expose the corruption of the people who want Josef to rule over Russia with the same brutality as his father. Mamantov's henchmen interrupt him, kicking and beating him to the ground. From above the crowd, Zinaida draws her father's Makarov and kills Josef.

It was built from to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The ruins of the Sugar Refinery on Graham Creek at Yengarie are the remains of an important industrial complex, which began operations for the firm of Tooth and Cran in the 1860s. It produced meat extract before working as a sugar mill and then as a major refinery that serviced many plantations and mills in the area before closing in 1899. Robert Tooth was born in 1821 and was the son of a hop merchant in Kent and nephew of a Sydney merchant and brewer who also owned numerous cattle runs. Robert and Edwin Tooth leased their uncle's Tooth and Co. brewery in 1843 and were joined by their brother Frederick in 1853. Robert speculated in pastoral properties and gold during the 1850s and was briefly involved with politics in New South Wales. He was also Director of the Bank of New South Wales in the 1850s and 1860s and Director of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, of which he was a major shareholder, between 1855 and 1863. He owned several pastoral properties in Queensland and in 1857 employed Robert Cran, first on Jondaryan Station and then as a supervisor at Pikedale. Cran was the same age as Tooth and had come to Queensland from Scotland in 1849. He first worked as a stockman and was employed on several properties by Tooth until he became manager of Tooth's boiling down works and abattoir at Yengarie in 1865. When the Maryborough Agricultural Reserve was thrown open for selection in March 1862, one of the first selectors was W C Giles, acting as agent for Robert Tooth of Widgee Widgee Station, who bought Lots 3 & 4 fronting the Mary River immediately below Graham's Creek. Tooth sold Widgee Widgee to JC White, who was his manager at Jondaryan. White set up a steam-powered abattoir and boiling-down works on the Yengarie land in 1863 but was financially ruined when pleuropneumonia killed most of his cattle the following year. Tooth foreclosed on both the station and land. Robert Cran then took on the mortgage of Widgee Widgee and Giles leased the Yengarie land for agistment, though he also became insolvent in 1865. Tooth was interested in the preservation of beef before refrigeration was available, and the boiling-down works was adapted with modern equipment as a meat extract plant, using Leibig's process. Tooth and Cran went into partnership with F F Nixon, Robert Lucas Tooth and Frederick Tooth as Tooth and Cran, the meat extract they produced winning a prize at the Intercolonial Exhibition in Sydney in 1870 and also receiving a prize at Amsterdam. By 1867 Yengarie had become a major business enterprise with bone crushing, wool washing and hide tanning divisions surrounded by what had become a small settlement. Sugar was becoming increasingly important in the area, and in 1867 Cran let contracts for clearing and planting cane and prepared to erect a sugar mill to work in conjunction with the meat extract factory. The first boiling in open pans began in October 1868. This produced a small-grained white sugar, immediately recognised as the best sugar available in the Maryborough area at the time. In 1869 a superior new process was installed under the supervision of Tooth, who was modern and innovative in his approach. The works at Yengarie were continually upgraded to keep pace with new developments and an increasing workload. In 1870 the mill was expanded. New and larger boilers were installed and charcoal retorts added to utilise bone waste for refining sugar. A distillery was installed and J T Annear constructed a brick chimney. From 1871 Yengarie operated as a refinery, juice being supplied by mills in the surrounding area, many of which were constructed in the 1870s. The partners owned plantations at Yengarie, Yerra Yerra and Irrawarra. Melanesian indentured labourers were employed in both the refinery and at the plantations, as they were on surrounding properties. With the increasing emphasis on sugar in the district, it was decided to close the meat extracting works in 1873. In the same year a horse-drawn tramway was constructed to the mill for conveying firewood, cane and later, juice. Juice mills were central to the sugar making process at Maryborough and by 1883, 28 small mills were sending juice to Yengarie by punt or through a network of pipes. At the height of its production, Yengarie produced three grades of sugar, rum, treacle and tar. The refinery became a very large undertaking comprising a factory, store, laboratory, distillery, brickworks, limekilns and wharves with a small township developing to accommodate workers and their families. Tooth and Cran also had their own steamer, the Nowra, which took sugar and rum to Maryborough for shipment south. From the 1870s gas produced to light the refinery was also piped to light the township, a luxury not then available in Maryborough. In 1875, the partnership with Nixon and Croft, the manager of Yerra Yerra, was dissolved and Tooth left for England, leaving Cran in charge. Tooth began a new refinery, also called Yengarie, in the Philippines in his own name. The Tooth and Cran partnership was dissolved in 1879 and Robert Cran and Company ran Yengarie. In 1880 Cran spent some time in Europe arranging for machinery for a new refinery he planned to build in Bundaberg. This was opened in 1883 as Millaquin and Cran provided land at Yengarie for a short branch line and siding to connect the complex to the state railway. In 1885 there were 40 mills and 5 distilleries along the Mary River, although production and sugar prices began to fall. In 1889 Cran and Company opened a crushing mill at Doolbi to provide juice to Yengarie, thereby supporting the development of cane growing in the Isis area. The 1890s brought problems due to depressed sugar prices and major changes in the sugar industry. Central mills servicing independent white farmers replaced the big plantations run by indentured labour, licenses to recruit Melanesian workers having ceased after December 1890. A number of plantations and mills closed and, by 1892, it was reported that much of the land along the Mary River was no longer under cultivation, or was growing crops other than sugar. The major flood in 1893 also damaged plantations and farms along the river and caused severe damage to the refinery. When Robert Cran died on 16 December 1894 he was insolvent and the Queensland National Bank took over his assets. The Yengarie site was permanently closed in 1899 and the land at Yerra Yerra, Irrawarra and Yengarie was cut up and sold between 1905 and 1908. James Mahoney, who owned a butchering business next to Yengarie, had occupied the land since 1900 and purchased it in 1908, using it for dairying, which became a major business in the area. His great grandson still owns the land. The roof of the main refinery building was destroyed by fire and storm in the 1930s and 1940s. Numerous galvanised iron sheds at the southern end of the refinery were removed, as were worker's houses, a butcher's shop and a smithy associated with the refinery. Part of the refinery building was used as a cattle dip until the early 1950s. Over the years the machinery was removed and dispersed. The boilers were the last major piece of equipment to be removed and were sold for scrap in 1964. The brick chimney, having become unsafe, was demolished in 1983. Evidence for the placement of machinery can still be seen in the form of concrete mountings, pits and shafts. The front and one side wall of the main building and sections of the other walls remain, though invaded by vegetation, particularly by a number of large fig trees growing within the building which have given the ruins a picturesque quality.  Description  The refinery ruins are located on Graham's Creek, a tributary of the Mary River, south east of Yengarie siding and south west of Maryborough. There were once wharves on the creek but these are not now evident. The most striking feature of the site is the standing ruin of the main refinery building, measuring approximately , as sections of brick, stone and pise walls on pise foundations. Most of the front wall remains and is pierced by a series of openings with round arched heads. Most of the wall on the side facing the river also remains standing but the other walls have collapsed. The building contains a large tank and several mature fig trees, the roots of which have penetrated the walls and foundations. The walls are buckled and slumped and have several large vertical cracks. Concrete mounts for equipment are visible on the north eastern side of the building and although much of the site is overgrown with vegetation, it is believed that other evidence of use remains, including pits and a shaft leading down to a water channel. The presence of these obscured pits prevented safe inspection of some parts of the site. The area is scattered with loose bricks, some of which were made on site and are considerably more friable than others that bear the imprint of Brown & Sons of Paisley or manganese bricks from the chimney. Rubble from the machinery shed forms a mound about behind the refinery building. Maintenance sheds were to the north of the refinery building. The line along which the tram track passed is visible approximately in front of the building. Other sections of line ran behind the mill and to the west, but these cannot readily be seen.  Heritage listing  Yengarie Sugar Refinery ruins was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The ruins of Yengarie Sugar Refinery are evidence for a major early industrial enterprise that made an important contribution to the development of the sugar industry in Queensland. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The ruins of Yengarie Sugar Refinery and surroundings have the potential to reveal further information about the operation of both the sugar and meat works industries in Queensland in the 19th century. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It is important for its association with the life and works of Robert Tooth and Robert Cran, who made a significant contribution to the development of the sugar industry in Queensland.

Plot The play is a comedic dramatization of the largely forgotten Herero and Namaqua genocide which took place in Namibia between 1904 and 1907 when the region was a German colony, after Germany confiscated tribal lands and the Herero people rebelled. The retribution over four years by German soldiers resulted in more than 65,000 deaths. The play deals with the enormity of this story by introducing it through the actors of a \\"presentation\\" which is intended to tell the story, and shows how the various players respond to the gruesome facts during first rehearsal.  Themes  The play reflects ethical debates in the theatre about representation, as the actors in the presentation use a series of improvisations during their rehearsal to explore personal relationships to the loss of culture experienced by the Herero as a consequence of the genocide. An undercurrent of the race issues of contemporary America is present in this rehearsal as the actors, three black and three white Americans struggle to retain a sense of polite political correctness while trying to humanize both the Herero and the German colonizers. The play also explores the capacity of humans to casually inflict suffering on one another, and as the exploration of German brutality through theatre spirals off the rails, the actors get carried away in the scene and the violence becomes scary. The play asks the audience to consider how the art and theatre we consume is produced, and how the relationships of the people involved can suffer during an intense creative process.

Grantland Rice of the New York Sun called it the \\"Game of the Century\\" and reported the following: > In a TCU Stadium that seated 30,000 spectators, over 36,000 wildly excited > Texans and visitors from every corner of the map packed, jammed, and fought > their way into every square foot of standing and seating space to see one of > the greatest football games ever played‚Ä¶this tense, keyed up crowd even > leaped the wire fences from the top of automobiles‚Ä¶\\" SMU scored the first 14 points of the game. TCU, led by All-American quarterback Sammy Baugh, tied the game at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Then, with seven minutes left in the game SMU, on a 4th and 4 on the Frogs' 37 yard-line, lined up to punt. Quarterback Bob Finley threw a 50-yard pass to running back Bobby Wilson who made what is described as a \\"jumping, twisting catch that swept him over the line for the touchdown.\\" TCU would lose the game 20‚Äì14, but would be invited to play the LSU Tigers in the 1936 Sugar Bowl, where the Frogs would be victorious 3‚Äì2 at messy and muddy Tulane Stadium. Even with the loss to SMU, who later lost to Stanford in the 1936 Rose Bowl, TCU claims 1935 as a national championship year.

Biography Born in Copenhagen, √òrskov was the daughter of Johannes Georg Oppenheuser, an engraver, and Helga Christensen. After matriculating from N. Zahle's School in 1941, she began to study medicine the encouragement of her chemistry teacher. Her friendship and later marriage (1948) with her fellow student , the son of the director of the Danish Serum Institute (Statens Serum Institut), raised her interest in bacteriology and led to close collaboration with her husband after he became head of the institute's coli department. After graduating from the University of Copenhagen in 1948, she became an assistant at the institute's International Salmonella Centre. Her thesis Om Klebsiella (1956) was one of the first scientific papers addressing the presence of bacterial cross- infection. Together with her husband, she investigated the virulence factors and related properties of coliforms. The work led to the establishment of a coli department which became the World Health Organization's International Escherichia Centre, leading to a national Salmonella Centre and an international Klebsiella Centre. In 1968, she was appointed overl√¶ge (head of department).

It took place between February 26 (New Style March 11) and April 24 (New Style May 7), 1918. This March, as well as the First Kuban Campaign, was a milestone in the formation of the White movement in Southern Russia.  The March  Colonel Drozdovsky, a staunch monarchist, had gathered around him in Ia»ôi after the October Revolution a detachment of between 800 and 1500 men, most of whom were young officers. Cut off from the rest of Russia after the signing of the Brest- Litovsk Treaty, the formation of an independent Ukrainian People's Republic and the destruction of the Odessa Soviet Republic by the advancing Germans, he decided to march to Novocherkassk on the Don to join the White Russian Volunteer Army. The detachment consisted of a skirmisher regiment, a cavalry division (commanded by Chief of Staff Colonel Vo√Ønalovitch), a mounted mountain battery, a light battery, a mortar company, a technical unit, a hospital and the train. This detachment, reinforced along the way by other small groups including Colonel Jebrak, marched 1,200 kilometers from March to May 1918 from Ia≈üi to Novocherkassk. The march of the detachment coincided with the advance of the German and Austrian Armies in accordance with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In spite of a certain mistrust, the Central forces behaved in a benevolent manner towards Drozdovsky and his men, not hindering their advance. Drozdovsky had to live with this uneasy situation, having no means to oppose the German and Austro-Hungarian troops. Marching in closed order, the detachment arrived in Rostov-on-Don on May 4 and took the city after fierce fighting with the Red Army. The detachment suffered some 100 casualties, including Colonel Vo√Ønalovitch. Leaving Rostov, Drozdovsky's men helped the Don Cossacks, in rebellion against Bolshevik power, to retake Novocherkassk. On the evening of May 7, 1918, the \\"Drozdovsky\\" detachment arrived in Novocherkassk under the acclamation of the inhabitants, bringing an end to the \\"Romanian march\\".

The White Army achieved an important victory despite being numerically inferior in manpower and artillery. It resulted in the capture of Ekaterinodar and Novorossiysk in August 1918 and the conquest of the Western part of Kuban by the White armies. Later in 1918 they took Maykop, Armavir and Stavropol, and extended their authority over the entire Kuban Region.  The campaign  At the end of the First Kuban Campaign, the Volunteer Army had been formed. In April 1918, the German and Ukrainian Army had driven the Bolsheviks from Ukraine, had taken Rostov-on-the-Don without a fight, and occupied the Crimean Peninsula. The Bolsheviks had fled, mainly towards the Caucasus at Novorossiisk. From here, units of Sorokin's and Avtonomov's Red Army terrorized the Cossack villages and cities, first and foremost Ekaterinodar. On June 22, 1918, the Volunteer Army launched the second Kuban campaign by attacking the Trogovaya railway junction in Salsk. The division of Mikhail Drozdovsky led the assault from the west, Alexander Borovski from the south and Ivan Erd√©lyi from the east. The Reds fled north, abandoning their artillery, rushing right into the arms of Sergey Markov's division, which defeated them completely. The victory was however overshadowed by the death of General Markov, killed by artillery fire on 25 June. After this first victory Denikin led his troops north towards Veliokniajeskaya. During the fighting the White cavalry, led by Erdelyi, routed the Red cavalry of Dumenko. This unexpected movement made the Bolsheviks believe that Tsaritsyn would be attacked and that the numbers were much larger (Lenin wrote to Zinoviev that Alekseev had 60,000 men). Stalin requisitioned six Petrov regiments for the defense of the city, diverting them from their route to Baku and thus sealing the fate of the local commissionars. Instead of marching on Tsaritsyn, Denikin headed south into Kuban, gaining another victory over the Reds near Belaya Glina. On July 15, a Red Army of 30,000 men under command of Karl Kalnin was crushed near Tikhoretskaia. Only 7 units escaped and reached Ekaterinodar. The volunteers captured 3 armored trains, 50 artillery pieces, tanks, planes and a large quantity of weapons, equipment and ammunition. The fighting of the first three weeks had costed the Volunteer Army a quarter of its men, but an influx of new volunteers, including captured enemy soldiers who joined the volunteer cause, led to an Army of 13,000 men.  Sorokin's counteroffensive  Threatened with encirclement, Sorokin attacked the rear of the right flank of the White Army. At the same time the Red Taman Army went on the offensive from Ekaterinodar and attacked the Volunteer Army head on. Sorokin, who in the meantime was commander-in-chief of the Red forces of the North Caucasus, threatened Tikhoretskaya and Denikin was forced to concentrate his troops which were spread over a front line of 140 kilometers long. On August 7, the decisive battle took place, not far from Vyselki. At first, the White Army seemed about to be annihilated, but were rescued by Kornilov's troops and a regiment of cavalry attacking from the north, while from the south came the Erdelyi cavalry with armored trains. Sorokin's army was trapped and routed. Around 4 pm the Red Western Army had ceased to exist, the survivors hastening to join Ekaterinodar.  Kuban uprising  After the victory of the Volunteers, all the Kuban rose up against the Bolsheviks. The stanitsa took up arms one after the other and a wave of alternately Red and White terror swept over the Kuban. General Viktor Pokrovsky, dispatched three months earlier by Denikin to organize the insurgents of the Laba region, captured Maykop and Armavir. The Terek Cossacks also revolted and took Mozdok, cutting Red communications between Stavropol and Vladikavkaz, and besieging Grozny. The Reds did not manage anymore to organize the defense of Ekaterinodar, their troops fleeing before the advance of the Whites. On August 15, the Whites took Ekaterinodar without a fight, followed on August 26 by Novorossiysk. The campaign then continued along the coast of the Black Sea towards Stavropol, which was taken on November 15,1918. Mikhail Drozdovsky was wounded in October 1918 near Stavropol. He never recovered and died on January 1, 1919, in the vicinity of Rostov-on-Don.

It took place on the Southern Front of the Russian Civil War and was a Soviet attempt to destroy White resistance. The operation ended with the defeat of the White forces in the North Caucasus and the evacuation of the remnants of the Volunteer Army, reduced to a corps, to Crimea. The Red Army advanced to the borders of Georgia and Azerbaijan by the end of the operation, which was followed by an invasion of Azerbaijan.  Background  The operation was a continuation of the offensive of the Southern and Southwestern Fronts in 1919‚Äì1920. By mid-January 1920, the Caucasian Front of Vasily Shorin had advanced 500 kilometers from Taganrog, west of the Kalmyk Steppe, with a bridgehead on the Don at Bataysk and on the Sal south of Kotelnikovo. It included the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th Armies and the 1st Cavalry Army for a total of 214,800, with 47,600 infantry, 22,700 cavalry, 590 guns, and 2,732 machine guns in combat units. They pursued the Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) of Lieutenant General Anton Denikin, which included the Separate Volunteer Corps of Lieutenant General Alexander Kutepov, the Don Army of Lieutenant General Vladimir Sidorin, the Caucasus Army of Lieutenant General V.L. Pokrovsky, the Forces of the North Caucasus of General of Cavalry I.G. Erdeli, and the Forces of the Black Sea Governorate of Lieutenant General A.S. Lukomsky, for a total of 250,000, with 60,500 infantry, 31,600 cavalry, 450 guns, and up to 1,200 machine guns in combat units. Despite the near equivalency of both sides in troop strength, White morale had declined as they retreated to the North Caucasus.  Prelude  The Soviet plan provided for the four armies of the right wing and center to launch a strong frontal attack towards Yekaterinodar along the line from the mouth of the Don to Sadovoe and destroy the White troops, preventing them from retreating towards the Kuban. On the left wing, the 11th Army was to simultaneously launch an offensive against Kizlyar and Svyatoy Krest. Subsequently, the offensive of the front was to be directed towards the center and left wing, using converging attacks to defeat the White troops in the central and southern North Caucasus and capture Stavropol, Mineralnye Vody, the Grozny oilfields, and Dagestan. The main shock group of the Caucasus Front was composed of the 1st Cavalry Army of Semyon Budyonny, the 8th Army of Grigory Sokolnikov, the 9th Army of Alexander Stepin, the 10th Army of Alexander Pavlov, and the Consolidated Cavalry Corps of Boris Dumenko for a total of 29,000 infantry and 19,000 cavalry, with about 450 guns and more than 2,000 machine guns. It was tasked with defeating the Separate Volunteer Corps and the Don and Caucasus Armies, preventing them from gaining bridgeheads on the left banks of the Don and Sal, and preparing the way for an attack on the headquarters of Denikin at Tikhoretsk after reaching the line of Yeysk, Velikoknyazheskaya and Lake Lopukhovatoe. The shock group faced the main forces of the Armed Forces of South Russia, numbering 29,000 infantry, 25,000 cavalry, up to 440 guns, and about 1,100 machine guns. The AFSR commanders counted on the coming rasputitsa to halt the Red offensive on the lower course of the Don and Sal, then planned to bring up reserves and launch a counterattack.  Don and Manych  A map of the operation The first phase of the offensive, described in Soviet historiography as the Don‚ÄìManych Operation, occurred between 17 January and 6 February. During the operation, the Caucasus Army retreated to the Manych in the face of the 40 to 60 kilometer-deep advance of the Red center and left wing. The greatest success was achieved by the 11th Army of Matvey Vasilenko who seized a bridgehead on the left bank of the Manych in the Divnoe area after outflanking the AFSR. Despite this, the Soviet troops failed to destroy the AFSR and reach their objectives, although the AFSR was forced to commit all of its operational reserves, which suffered heavy losses and were thoroughly exhausted in fierce fighting. On the left flank of the 11th Army, the 2nd Consolidated Brigade reached the Kuma and elements of the Expeditionary Corps of Yu.P. Butyagin took Svyatoy Krest on 25 January. Meanwhile, in the deep rear of the AFSR, 2,500 pro-Bolshevik partisans of the Red Army of the Black Sea under E.S. Kazansky disrupted White control. At the beginning of February Denikin ordered the subordination of the Separate Volunteer Corps to the Don Army for a counterattack, but the Caucasus Front preempted this by resuming the advance.  Tikhoretsk and Stavropol  The second phase of the offensive, described in Soviet historiography as the Tikhoretsk Operation, ran from 14 February to 2 March. During the operation, the Red attack decisively defeated the AFSR, splitting the White front in the North Caucasus in two and creating the conditions for the final attack. As a result, the strategic initiative in the Caucasus finally passed to the Red Army. To stave off complete defeat, Denikin began a retreat into the Kuban. Simultaneous with the Tikhoretsk Operation, the 11th Army cooperated with pro-Bolshevik partisans at Stavropol to carry out the Stavropol Operation, during which that city was taken on 29 February, and the Kuban Army (the renamed Caucasus Army) pushed back into the Kuban.  Soviet pursuit  Denikin aboard a destroyer during the Novorossiysk evacuation The third phase of the operation was defined in Soviet historiography as lasting from 3 March to 7 April. The main forces of the Caucasus Front conducted the Kuban‚ÄìNovorossiysk Operation between 3 and 27 March, during which the defeat of the AFSR was completed in the North Caucasus. The 1st Cavalry Army captured Tikhoretsk on 9 March, then moved towards the Terek River. The 35,000-strong remnants of the Separate Volunteer Corps and parts of the Don Army evacuated from Novorossiysk to Crimea by 26 March. The core of the Don army evacuated from Tuapse. The final stage of the offensive of the 11th Army was also developed, along a 400-kilometer front. The troops of the army divided into three groups: the Stavropol towards Armavir, the Georgiyevsk towards Mozdok, and the Expeditionary Corps towards Petrovsk. On 17 March elements of the Stavropol Group took Armavir and Nevinnomyssk. As a result of the Red victories, pro-Bolshevik partisans in the Terek became active and captured Mineralnye Vody on 14 March. On the next day they took Pyatigorsk and held it until the approach of Red Army units. In mid- March, the left flank units of the 10th Army (the 20th, 28th, and 32nd Rifle Divisions) reached Pyatigorsk, where they were operationally subordinated to the 11th Army. The command of the latter combined these with the Stavropol Group of Forces to form the Terek Group of the army on 18 March, tasked with advancing on Grozny and Vladikavkaz. Between 12 and 24 March the group conducted the Grozny operation, capturing that city on 24 March. On the same day, partisans supported by rebellious workers in Vladikavkaz seized that city and held it for six days until the approach of the Red Army units. The Soviet troops then advanced into Dagestan, where Derbent was occupied by partisans on 25 March and Petrovsk on 30 March by partisans and the Expeditionary Corps. As a result, by early April, the Dagestan operation of the 11th Army and partisans had captured the region from the AFSR. Simultaneously, Terek Oblast, Kabardia, North Ossetia, and Chechnya were occupied. The White strongholds of Fort Alexandrovsk and Chechen' Island on the Caspian, which had threatened Red communications, were also captured by two separate landing operations of the Caspian Flotilla of Fyodor Raskolnikov. The final operation of the third phase was the Tuapse operation between 27 March and 7 April, during which the 9th Army, a cavalry brigade of the 1st Cavalry Army and partisans from the former Red Army of the Black Sea eliminated the Don Army and captured Tuapse on 7 April. Most of the latter surrendered, though remnants of the force retreated to Sochi, linking up with the Kuban Army. A 31,000-strong group of Kuban and Don Cossacks, with up to 30,000 refugees, was surrounded by Soviet troops in the area of Sochi, Adler, and Khosta. The Soviet blockade took place between the sea and the Georgian border against the last remaining large organized White force in the North Caucasus. By late April, about 12,000 Cossacks and 3,000 refugees had been evacuated to Crimea. The remainder surrendered between 4 and 7 May. Remnants of Cossacks moved into the mountains or crossed the Georgian border and were interned.  Aftermath  In late April, the Caucasus Front advanced to the border of Georgia and Azerbaijan from the Black Sea to the Caspian, preceding the invasion of Azerbaijan. The front had captured an area of 296,000 square kilometers with a population of 6.91 million during the operation. The operation resulted in the destruction of a large portion of the AFSR, one of the strongest threats to the Bolsheviks; Soviet troops reported the capture of 163,600 White soldiers and officers, 537 guns, 723 machine guns, 23 armored trains, seventeen tanks, thirty armored cars, about 3.4 million artillery shells, and 60 million cartridges, among others. The victory of the operation freed up large forces for the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War and the Perekop‚ÄìChongar Offensive later that year. In Crimea, Denikin gave up command to Pyotr Wrangel on 4 April and went into exile. For their actions in the operation, three rifle and three cavalry regiments of the Red Army were awarded the Honorary Revolutionary Red Banner along with a single artillery battery, while two regiments of the 21st Rifle Division received the Order of the Red Banner.

Square Enix handled primary development on Final Fantasy XV, and the game was released worldwide in November 2016; the total development time covered approximately ten years. The game was originally announced as Final Fantasy Versus XIII, a PlayStation 3-exclusive spin-off title. It was part of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked by a common mythos: while retaining thematic links, specific references were removed to aid with marketing. Additional media was created to portray the world of XV without using sequels; dubbed the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\", it included a feature film, an original net animation, a virtual reality simulation game, multiple mobile projects including an abridged version of the game, ports to Microsoft Windows and Stadia, and a novel The Dawn of the Future depicting an alternate finale. The game was originally directed by Tetsuya Nomura, who also created the story concept and main character designs. Nomura wanted to create a darker Final Fantasy title unsuitable for the main series. The initial development went slowly, and by 2007 the scale of the project generated discussions about rebranding the game as the next main entry in the series. Production on Versus XIII ended in 2012, when it was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV and transferred over to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PlayStation 3 version, which was originally built using the company's proprietary Crystal Tools game engine, was abandoned due to concerns about the platform's shortening life cycle. Its engine was changed to the Luminous Engine, custom-built by Square Enix for eighth- generation gaming hardware. After its change of platforms, the production team headed by Hajime Tabata, whose previous work included Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Type-0, was brought on board to aid production. Tabata became co-director, and was eventually promoted to sole director after Nomura was transferred to work on other projects within the company. After the transition to eighth-generation hardware, multiple changes were made so that it better suited the new consoles and its new status as a mainline game: these included radical staff reshuffles, and the reevaluation of the game's content. The latter part resulted in some scenes and characters from Versus XIII being cut. Later in production, multiple other studios were brought in to help with various aspects of the game. Since its original announcement, release of information became sporadic, leading to video game journalists labeling it as vaporware and eventually to rumors of its cancellation. After its public rebranding in 2013, the silence continued until its appearance at the 2014 Tokyo Game Show, at which point development and progress information was released on a regular basis. A demo for the game, Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae, was released in March 2015 with first print copies of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. Promotion for the title was effectively restarted at the 2015 Gamescom. Its release was delayed due to polishing work and the wish for a simultaneous worldwide release, something no other mainline Final Fantasy title had managed to accomplish. Cosmetic, gameplay and story-based downloadable content (DLC) were developed between 2016 and 2019 to fix issues raised by players and expand upon the base game. Production=Staff The logo of Final Fantasy XV: designed by alt=A one-winged woman in flowing robes rests with her head on her arms. Behind her is a crystal sphere surrounded by a sun-like adornment, with a serpentine creature woven into it. She rests near the logo of Final Fantasy XV. The piece is done in a pastel watercolor style that fades from silver to blue to black. Final Fantasy XV was originally a spin-off title named Final Fantasy Versus XIII, created by Square Enix as part of the wider Final Fantasy franchise. It was directed by Tetsuya Nomura, and produced by Shinji Hashimoto and Yoshinori Kitase. Nomura created the original scenario, designed the main character, and was also the original director and one of the original game designers. The CGI cutscenes were directed by Takeshi Nozue, who had previously worked on Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The music was composed by Yoko Shimomura, and the script was written by regular Final Fantasy scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Tomohiro Hasewaga was art director, the mechanical designer was Takeyuki Takeya, and the event planning director was Jun Akiyama. After the game's name and platform change in 2012, there were multiple staff reshuffles, though Shimomura, Hashimoto, Hasewaga and Nozue retained their original positions. Nomura became co-director alongside Hajime Tabata, the director of Final Fantasy Type-0, then was moved to other projects and replaced as full director by Tabata. Saori Itamuro became the new scriptwriter, using Nojima's original scenario as a base for the new work. Kitase left as co-producer, while Yusuke Naora, Isamu Kamikokuryo, and many artists involved in the development of Type-0 were involved. Non-Japanese staff included character designer Roberto Ferrari, game designer Prasert Prasertvithyakarn, and party interaction designer Wan Hazmer. The staff as formed in 2012, not counting later additions, was made up of the combined Final Fantasy XV and Type-0 development teams. By 2014, between 200 and 300 people were working on the game. From 2006 to 2013, Final Fantasy XV was developed by what was then Square Enix 1st Production Department. In the wake of extensive business restructuring in 2013, development was transferred to the newly formed Business Division 2, headed by Tabata and incorporating the core Final Fantasy development team. In 2018, the Final Fantasy XV team were incorporated into Luminous Productions, a new subsidiary led by Tabata who continued to work on both an untitled AAA project and post-release content for Final Fantasy XV. Along with bringing in staff members from other sections of the company, they also recruited help from other development studios: HexaDrive was brought in to help with engineering the game, XPEC Entertainment helped with the design for the later sections of the game, Shanghai company Plusmile helped with the design of buildings, licensed middleware from Umbra was used to boost the game's graphics, while Streamline Studios was brought in to help with technical development. It was initially supposed, after an announcement in 2015, that Avalanche Studios was brought on board to help create the game's airship mechanics. In the event, Avalanche and Square Enix did not directly collaborate: instead, Avalanche showed them their level of detail development methods, and Square Enix's internal team created the airship mechanics using that information. The image illustration and logo design was done by Yoshitaka Amano, who was brought on at the beginning of the game's production and designed the logo based on the game's themes. Several pieces of Amano's original artwork were retained and used in promotion when the game changed from Versus XIII to XV. In contrast to other major parts of the game, the logo artwork survived almost unchanged aside from its coloring. Amano also designed a new version of the logo that faded in during the game's ending, collaborating with the development team on its use. According to Tabata, the new logo signified the beginning of a new journey, and also representing the game's development since it was known as Versus XIII. Development Final Fantasy Versus XIII was created as part of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries within the Final Fantasy franchise featuring games linked by a common mythos which included Final Fantasy XIII and Type-0: apart from the mythos, they are completely separate, and each game's staff are able to interpret the mythos for each game. Versus XIII was one of the original titles created for the subseries alongside Final Fantasy XIII, forming the core of the series around which future titles would evolve. Nomura intended Versus XIII to be a heavy departure from his lighthearted Kingdom Hearts series. He attributed this move to his \\"love for extremes\\" and explained the direction he took as closer to his personal taste and completely different from what producers had requested him to do in the past. Early in development, Nomura said that the concept and thinking behind the game was unfitting for a regular numbered Final Fantasy installment, thus explaining its original status as a spin-off. His role as director of Versus XIII, in addition to other projects, was a move made following the departure of series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi from the company. Production began in 2006 by the development team responsible for the Kingdom Hearts series as a PlayStation 3 exclusive, although Nomura had created the game concept some years prior. Versus XIII was defined by Nomura as the dark side of XIII, which was emphasized by the game's title. In 2008, it was reported that development was put on hold so the team could complete Final Fantasy XIII. This information was later clarified as a mistranslation, with the actual situation being that developers from the Versus XIII team were helping with XIII in their spare time, with development on both games going according to their original schedules. By June 2010, Nomura reported that the game's story, and the character and clothing designs had been completed. By June 2011, the game was reportedly still only in the pre-production phase. Full production on Versus XIII began in September of that year, with a planned release in late 2014. According to later staff, Versus XIII was only 20-25% complete when the change of name and platform took place, with Tabata saying that the game \\"never really took shape\\". It was also stated by Tabata that the staff's efforts to fix issues with Versus XIII went on for far too long. According to staff, when Tabata arrived the production team were \\"exhausted and fretful\\" following the project's collapse. Due to the growing scale of the project, talks about changing Versus XIII into the next numbered entry in the series were appearing as early as 2007. When Type-0, originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, was renamed, and the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were presented to Square Enix in 2011, it was decided to shift the game onto those consoles. For a time, a PlayStation 3 version continued development, but after a title change announcement could not be made in 2012, the shortening lifespan of the console caused concern for the company and team. After some trial and error, the PlayStation 3 was abandoned as lead platform in favor of a DirectX 11-based development structure allowing easy porting to next-generation systems. Another presumed reason for the shift was due to the game's protracted development and escalating budget. The game was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV and began development in this form in July 2012. A proposal to turn Final Fantasy XV into a musical after Nomura watched the 2012 film adaptation of Les Mis√©rables was vetoed by the higher-ups at Square Enix. At the beginning of development, the new team reviewed the content of Versus XIII and decided what could be sensibly carried over to the new project. While many design elements were retained, some needed to be changed or removed. Tabata's new position as co-director and eventually as director was related to this change. The separate engine, gameplay, graphics and design sections of the team were merged into one unit to help with development. Nomura remained as co-director alongside Tabata so the project could remain as true to the original vision as possible, after which he was reassigned to other projects within the company including Kingdom Hearts III, while Tabata took up full directorial duties to bring the project to completion. Due to the state of the project during 2012, Square Enix's then-CEO Yoichi Wada was considering cancelling outright so the team could start from scratch under Tabata's direction. Most of Tabata's team were reluctant to merge with Nomura's team due to the negative reputation of Versus XIII within the company, with Tabata taking six months to bring them all round to the idea. Tabata officially became director in December 2013. Development initially followed the pattern of previous high-budget games, but the team eventually realized that such techniques had become dated. During the later part of development, Tabata's main concern was keeping the game on schedule instead of letting the development become delayed by experimentation with the technology. Despite the protracted development, the budget was kept under strict control. A major issue was deciding what elements to carry over and what had to be changed or discarded, as the project was already known and fans had expectations. When describing his attitude to development, Tabata described the team set-up as \\"horizontal\\", using a non-hierarchical staff structure to help speed up the exchange of information and feedback between departments. This drastic shift was unheard of for major Japanese game developers, and was met with a mixed reaction from staff: some were elated at their new freedom, while others felt downgraded. Including the initial work on Versus XIII, the game's development spanned approximately ten years from conception to release: despite its origins, Tabata considers Versus XIII and XV to be two separate entities. Speaking later, Tabata said that the developers were \\"playing it by ear\\", as little of the final game's content was set prior to his taking over. Post-release support Hajime Tabata served as the director of Final Fantasy XV from 2014 to its release, assuming the role of producer for its post-release content prior to his departure from Square Enix in 2018. Both free and paid downloadable content (DLC) was planned as early as April 2016, with paid DLC being a necessity due to production costs. Plans for DLC content were finalized by June of that year, with a small team working on it while the main game was completed. The main aim was to make players feel they had made a good purchase. Full production began after the main game was completed in November 2016. The DLC development was handled by Haruyoshi Sawatari, who took over as producer when Tabata saw the game would not make its projected September 30 release date; Tabata continued to focus on polishing the main game, while Sawatari created the DLC with a group of core developers, although Tabata continued to oversee their production. While having story-based DLC focused on each character seemed to undermine the main appeal of the story, Sawatari noted that the breaks gave characters a chance to grow as individuals before returning to and strengthening the group. Square Enix stressed when the details were announced that the DLC was not content cut from the game itself, but original content to add new experiences for players. Reception of the first wave of story-based DLC was so strong that the team decided to create a second wave of content. The new content would focus on creating a new storyline while tying up any remaining loose ends that players found with the storyline and lore. During this period, production shifted from Business Division 2 to Luminous Productions, who worked simultaneously on the post- release content and their new IP. Tabata continued overseeing development as producer. However Tabata was growing steadily less interested in the project, and wanted to go ahead on \\"his own path\\" without inconveniencing anyone at Square Enix. After internal discussions, Tabata decided to leave Square Enix and form his own studio. The company parted with Tabata on good terms, but the decision was made to cancel all but one of the subsequent DLC episodes and end post-release support for the game following that episode's 2019 release. It was also decided by Luminous Productions to focus on development of their new IP, contributing to the DLC's cancellation. Design=Story and characters While XVs story was similar to other entries, Nomura wanted to create more realistic characters. He wanted to make XV \\"about men in the real world\\", including less fantasy elements, describing it as the darkest entry in the series. From 2010 onwards, the story was undergoing frequent revisions. When Versus XIII became XV, multiple aspects were changed, including the removal of story sequences and the redesigning of characters. The most notable change was the replacement of original heroine Stella Nox Fleuret with the similarly-named Lunafreya. When consulted over the proposed changes, Nojima said that he would be content as long as the overall concept remained faithful to the original, giving the team the needed confidence to make the changes. The game's ending was left deliberately ambiguous so players could imagine what came next. The concept of reaper-worship from the original scenario was toned down, as it would have been a violation of age-rating criteria in some countries; explicit references to those elements were replaced with the general impression of black being a special color for the main cast and their home country. The game's main theme is \\"bonds\\", as represented by the relationships between Noctis and his comrades, and between Noctis and his father Regis. A key narrative element was Noctis' personal journey from prince to king. The story took place over a ten-year time period to properly portray Noctis' journey, with the characters aging appropriately. As opposed to earlier Final Fantasy games which jumped between different character groups, the game focused almost entirely on the central cast, with developments concerning the supporting cast happening off-screen. This was chosen to make the main cast more compelling and create a narrative based on their point of view. In contrast to many previous Final Fantasy titles, the playable cast of XV is all-male, although women still played key roles in the story. This was influenced by Nomura's wish for a road movie vibe and experiences from his youth. The clothing for characters was designed by Hiromu Takahara, lead designer for Japanese fashion house Roen. He was brought on when Nomura was occupied with other duties including designing the main cast of Final Fantasy XIII. The main reason for his inclusion was the wish to preserve the game's realism by creating designs influenced by Western fashions. Takahara's designs were retained during the transition as they were a core part of the initial project. World design When first announced, XV used the mythos of Fabula Nova Crystallis, described by Kitase as \\"a backdrop and starting point\\" for the story. For Versus XIII, Nomura decided to focus more on the world and on realistic human characters. The terminology of the mythos, including the concept of l'Cie (magically imbued warriors burdened with a pre-determined task), was originally present in Versus XIII. A key figure in the mythos, the Goddess Etro, was originally represented in-game in a piece of artwork by Amano and was a key deity worshiped in the game world. During the transition process between Versus XIII and XV, the game \\"disconnected\\" from the mythos' core framework, existing as a thematic base for the world and story without being overtly expressed. While the adjustments were being decided upon, it was chosen to keep the mythos as part of XV, as much of the world was built upon it and would lose a lot of its substance if removed entirely. Instead, the team chose to adjust the mythos to fit the game's modern setting. Specific terminology such as \\"l'Cie\\" was removed so the game would retain an individual identity and introduce the concepts in an understandable way. A common theme carried over into XV was defined by Tabata as humans chosen by the crystal placing their lives at risk. The revised cosmology drew inspiration from Japanese folklore and various Western mythologies. The game's summoned monsters, referred to as \\"Astrals\\", were designed to play integral parts in the story and world as opposed to being simple monsters to be called into battle. They were intelligent beings that Noctis needed to forge a pact with rather than simply commanding them. Due to their key role in the story, the staff chose traditional Final Fantasy summons such as Leviathan and Titan instead of creating ones unique to the game. Shinjuku, Tokyo was the primary inspiration for Insomnia, capital of Lucis. The central theme of the world and story is \\"fantasy based on reality\\": the setting is based on the real world and the fantasy elements grew out of familiar settings. Realizing this aspect of the game was quite difficult before the game's move onto eighth-generation hardware. Nomura had wanted to use a present-day setting for a Final Fantasy game ever since this idea had been considered but abandoned during the development of Final Fantasy VII. As such, some of the designs in Final Fantasy XV are based on real-world locations: among them are the districts of Tokyo, the Piazza San Marco and St Mark's Basilica in Venice, the Bahamas, and natural locations such as a cavern in Chiba Prefecture. Insomnia, the crown city of Lucis, is specifically influenced by the Shinjuku, Tokyo area which houses the headquarters of Square Enix and which Nomura passes through every day. The highway and tunnel seen in the game are almost exact replicas of the Shuto Expressway and a tunnel in the Ginza district, respectively. The team created these by driving down the real-world locations repeatedly during their research. The design inspirations for Niflheim ranged from the Roman Empire to pre-Germanic and Germanic civilizations. The game's theme of \\"fantasy based on reality\\" was emphasized on multiple levels in the environments, such as the blending of realism and fantasy in Insomnia, and the camping equipment, which was included through a collaboration with Coleman Company. Another factor in the original development of set pieces was the design of vast and seamless environments. They were meant to enable scenarios such as the player character being shot at from a great distance, or a battle which would change scenes between the outside and inside of a building. This corroborated Nomura's intended action-oriented system with more intuitive game controls. He instructed his team to study third-person shooters for reference, \\"not in simplistic terms, like controls or mechanics, but in the way they create tension and mood and incorporate the action within that\\". This carried over into XV, with the stated aim being to distance the game structurally from XIII and its sequels, which featured divided zones rather than a large seamless world. The original inspiration behind this approach was the world design of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, with later inspirations being modern Western triple-A open world titles. The environments are divided into three different segments, with separate teams working on each: the world map, locations in the game world, and dungeons. The dungeons were designed to be beautiful, frightening, and memorable. Specific pieces of concept art were created to represent different regions and aesthetic concepts; a single building design was used to capture the essence of Altissia's Venice-inspired atmosphere, while older car designs when compared to the party's vehicle Regalia reflected the lack of human advancement outside Lucis. For the monster designs, Tabata told Hasegawa that their goal was a sense of realism equivalent to the photography of National Geographic. The first monster designed with this mindset was the Behemoth. For mystical enemies, the team went towards \\"throwback\\" designs, using popular enemy designs from the series' history. The monster designs were drawn from various sources. A difficult monster to design was the Catoblepas, one of the larger monsters; particular attention to detail was given to the head and legs, as they were the most visible areas to players. The Mesmenir, which was raised as an example of the balance between fantasy and realism, was designed with a horse-like body along with a horn inspired by the appendages on seahorses. The Goblins and Naga were not given an original design, instead being taken directly from their original artwork by Amano for earlier Final Fantasy games and inserted into the game in as realistic a form as possible. The Ronin was designed to resemble the traditional dress style of its namesake, with both the clothing and fabric created using descriptions from books and images of antique samurai clothing and swords. The game's mounts, recurring galliform birds called Chocobos, were designed so players would feel affection for them. The most challenging part of the design was adding fantastic flourishes while keeping it from being garish. Another recurring Final Fantasy creature, the Moogle, was originally present in Versus XIII, and was going to be similar in design to its Final Fantasy Type-0 incarnation. Moogles were initially dropped from XV; they were retained after a Twitter poll in November 2015, where fans requested that Moogles be included. Due to the game being close to completion, it was a token inclusion that would not impact the main development. Music The game's original score was primarily composed and arranged by Yoko Shimomura, who was most widely known for her work on the Kingdom Hearts series and was a first- time composer for the Final Fantasy series. Working on the greater majority of the soundtrack, Shimomura was involved throughout the game's development cycle. The theme song of Versus XIII, \\"Somnus\\", was sung by Aundr√©a L. Hopkins; its lyrics were written by Nomura, which were translated and adapted into Latin by Taro Yamashita and Kazuhiro Komiya. When Versus XIII was rebranded as XV, \\"Somnus\\" was retained as an important theme, though it was replaced as the official theme song. The game's theme song is a cover of Ben E. King's \\"Stand by Me\\", performed by the English indie rock band Florence and the Machine and sung by the band's leader Florence Welch. In addition to \\"Stand by Me\\", Florence and the Machine created two original songs inspired by the world and story of XV: \\"Too Much Is Never Enough\\" and \\"I Will Be\\". For the game's additional media, the music was handled by other composers such as John R. Graham, Yasuhisa Inoue and Susumi Akizuki. Music for later content was handled by Yoshitaka Suzuki; guest composers were brought in for major story expansions, including Keiichi Okabe, Naoshi Mizuta, Yasunori Mitsuda and Nobuo Uematsu. The soundtrack for Final Fantasy XV was released on December 21, 2016, with multiple editions being created. The three songs by Florence and the Machine were released under the banner title \\"Songs from Final Fantasy XV\\" as digital singles on August 12 for iTunes, Google Play and Spotify. Tracks from the game were released on other albums of Shimomura's music, and \\"Somnus\\" was featured as downloadable content for Theatrhythm Final Fantasy. Graphics During its initial development, Versus XIII used Crystal Tools, a proprietary game engine created by Square Enix for seventh-generation gaming hardware that would be used throughout the company for multiple games, including XIII and Final Fantasy XIV. Later, Tabata described the Crystal Tools hardware as an extension of the technology of the previous gaming generation. During 2010, Nomura revealed that the team were using real world- based physical calculations to determine weather and cloud behavior in-game. By 2011, Nomura announced that the game was no longer using Crystal Tools, and instead used a specially designed proprietary gameplay engine combined by lighting technology from Luminous Engine, an engine built for eighth- generation gaming hardware. The focus on realism influenced the decision to incorporate the more advanced lighting technology, while the specially designed engine had a limited area of use. The planned scale of the open world increased so much that the older technology eventually became obsolete as it was restricting the developers. The need to create new technology to cope with these problems further added to initial development difficulties. The original plan was to have interactive real-time event scenes. Nomura felt that regular storytelling cutscenes in other games interrupted gameplay and caused players to skip them. Furthermore, the development frame could theoretically be shortened as there was no need to create cutscenes-exclusive high-polygon character models. However, seamless transitions of these events into the gameplay were hard to achieve and instead increased the time that had to be invested by the team. After the full shift onto eighth-generation platforms, multiple planned elements were influenced by the new Luminous technology: the in-game cutscene camera was optimized to work similarly to the one used in pre-rendered movies, and more environmental and gameplay elements could be included such as an increased number of destructible environments and the player character's warping to faraway spots on the game maps. It also enabled Nomura to start experimenting with higher facial detail for enemies such as behemoths. When the game was renamed and changed platforms, the team chose the Luminous Engine as the main game engine. The game's real-time graphics used 5,000 polygons per-frame, bringing its visual quality close to modern CGI cutscenes and to a level that would have been impossible for the previous generation's hardware. The game's native resolution was 1920 √ó 1080 pixels (1080p), with a frame rate of 30 frames per second: this was defined as being native to the game as opposed to upscaled games from the previous generation. For polygon models, the combined number of visible and occluded polygons was estimated as being 5,000,000. This number was approximately five times the amount of equivalent detail from last-generation games. Models used over 600 character bones: 150 bones were created for the face, 300 for the hair, and 150 for the body. A bone-based physical simulation technology was applied so that clothing would react to the body's movements. The polygon count for character hair was estimated as 20,000, the same number used in an entire character in last-generation games. All of these were achievable due to the fact that the eighth-generation console hardware had approximately sixteen times the amount of storage available in the previous generation. During the transition from Versus XIII to XV and the optimization of the Luminous Engine for game development, the team created a conceptual environment using a prototype engine environment called \\"Ebony\\". After the initial reveal, the team ran into difficulties with the new hardware, prompting them to contact HexaDrive due to their experience with high-spec gaming hardware. To solve the issues faced by XV, the team used a similar development approach to Ubisoft: they created an approximate game system that they could build on and edit in real-time. Graphics and animation were developed first, followed by a cinematics editor and a system to manage events during transitions between cutscenes and gameplay. This latter element was what allowed the developers to create what would become the game's final version. To help maximize the realism of the characters, their hair was first created by a hairstylist using a mannequin's wig, then rendered into the game using the technology of the Luminous Engine. The same technique was used for Agni's Philosophy, the engine's 2012 demo. Character movements were created using motion capture technology: the animators' movements were first captured while they wore special suits, then their actions were adjusted in the team's computer to perfect them and make minor additions like finger movements. These actions were then implemented in the game environment for the intended characters. During production, Tabata and the new development staff used experience from a failed attempt to develop an eighth-generation console sequel to Type-0 when handling the new hardware. While using Luminous Studio for games other than XV was considered during production, the engine's technology manager Julien Merceron advised against it until it has been proven and released in a finished form. While CGI cutscenes created by dedicated Square Enix subsidiary Visual Works were present throughout its lifetime, there were far fewer than originally planned in the final game. The team instead relied on real-time cutscenes as much as possible, except for scenes with a scale too great to use real-time graphics. The transition to next-generation hardware enabled the team to better realize their original vision for the game, as conveyed in the original reveal trailer. Visual Works also worked closely with the team during development of 3D modelling systems, due to their previous experiences with such technology in cutscene development. Gameplay Versus XIII used an action-based combat system based primarily on the Kingdom Hearts battle system. Gameplay elements from third-person shooters were also to have been incorporated. Character movement was designed to be fast-paced. During earlier gameplay trailers, the pace of gameplay was deliberately slowed down so viewers could have a better view of events. In addition to Noctis, his companions were also controllable, each harnessing unique weapons and all being able to enter and control mechs and airships. Noctis was the only character with access to all weapon types within the game (including swords, axes, guns, lances and others), with the current selection of weapons leading to different combos. Group attacks could not be manually triggered, but party members would team up automatically for a \\"super attack\\". In addition, attacks could be chained together by players switching between characters during battle. Magic was available to all characters, but only when Noctis was a part of the party, a consideration that was closely tied to the story. A job system was in place, but it was exclusive to enemy units, with those present including dragoons and summoners. Environments outside cities also featured a day-night cycle and roaming enemies, with different enemy monsters appearing at different times of day. Several initial concepts for the game had to be abandoned; a planned first-person view and the lack of a heads-up display (HUD) were scrapped because these ideas were deemed incompatible with the style of the Final Fantasy series. An overhead camera view was also considered for the open field areas, but it was decided against so the player would remain immersed. When the final Versus XIII trailer was released, the HUD was a mixture of finalized and temporary elements. There were even plans for the game to have a \\"unique\\" support setup for the Sixaxis controller. Although after the game's transition there were technological and mechanical changes, the basic elements established in trailers such as Noctis' warping and weapon abilities were carried over. For XV, the battle system was dubbed the Active Cross Battle system. Noctis was made the only player-controlled character, with the others being relegated to command functions governed by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). The team experimented with a multi-character battle system, but eventually decided that it presented too many development difficulties. Noctis' weapons were to be arranged in a deck, and contextually activated in combat. Later, this was changed so that weapon-switching could be done freely during battle, with special attacks using the standard weapons unless others were in place. Instead of a multi-button combo system, combat became focused on single-button combat tied to timed attacks and contextually activated special abilities, in addition to co-op attacks triggered with other members of the party. One ability that was carried over from Versus XIII to XV was Noctis's Limit Break \\"Armiger\\", where he summoned multiple weapons into battle to attack and defend; this was initially seen in the original trailer for XV, and later in both the demo and the final game. Noctis was to have been the only character in the world of XV to wield magic, but as this would not have worked from a gameplay perspective, the team created a story-related pretext that allowed other characters to wield magic. After the demo's release, the Cross-Link system was improved and other systems were put into place. Polishing work on the game continued up until the final version was released. The navigation was described after its 2014 re-reveal as \\"open world\\": Tabata later clarified that while character progression was driven by the story, the various areas within the world could be freely explored by players. He also wished for a fusion of gameplay and story similar to The Last of Us. Based on feedback from the game's first commercial demo, adjustable difficulty settings were added in the form of players changing \\"battle modes\\" to alter the speed and complexity of battles. A major element added to the game was Prompto's ability to take photographs. As the character had garnered negative feedback from players, Tabata wanted to make the character more useful and appealing to players, and so it was incorporated into the game so players could chronicle their journey. The inclusion of an airship function into the party's vehicle came from Tabata's wish to keep the party in the Regalia while simulating the experience of landing an aircraft. The team experimented with enabling compatibility with virtual reality headsets, but this proved impractical as players would likely be wearing them for hours at a time due to the game's size. The game's shift during the second half of the story from an open world to a linear structure was based on story requirements and budgetary restrictions, as making the entire experience open world would have doubled development time and costs. Many elements added to the game in later updates, such as controlling all the main characters, had to be discarded from the main game due to technological and budget-based restrictions. =Artificial intelligence= The lead designer for the game's AI was Yoichiro Miyake, who was one of the core team members for the game's engine. Miyake, whose reputation designing quality AI had landed him the position, had an initial concept of creating an AI that would learn and memorize new actions, creating a smooth flow through the various steps it needed to take to make a smoother and more advanced experience. At the start of its development, the developers used the two standard \\"classic\\" designs for AIs for reference: behavior-based, which revolved around adaptation and decision making, and state-based, which made decisions based on the environment. For XV, it was decided to create an advanced hybrid of these basic behavioral AI functions. Due to the way Luminous Studio's staff was structured, the team first needed to develop an easy-to-understand tool for managing and developing the AI. This tool was dubbed the \\"Luminous AI Graph\\", which represented the multi-layered construction of an AI. The amount of effort put into the AI was directly inspired by experiences of developing games for the previous console generation: the emphasis had been put on graphics, causing the AI and other gameplay-related elements to suffer. Between the release of its commercial demo and the full release, the AI underwent further refinement. The AI functions were divided into three different categories: \\"meta\\", which governed the environment and in-game progression; \\"character\\", which was devoted to the guest and non-playable characters (NPCs); and \\"navigation\\", which determined the best route and pattern for characters and other moving elements such as enemies to travel. The tasks assigned to the meta-AI were so numerous and large that it needed to be divided into separate interconnected elements, which included implementing a hierarchical structure for task management, transitioning and the merger of functions to create an intelligent system, and the exchange of various elements with specific localities. For the character-AI, a major point was the coordination between the AI and character animations when responding to different situations. Different levels and styles of AI were created for different groups of non-playable characters within XVs world, from the main party members to NPCs around the world. To ensure the navigation-AI worked properly for enemies and monsters, a system dubbed the \\"Point Query System\\" (PQS) was created, which could direct and steer them in a realistic manner while avoiding collisions with objects in the environment or other moving elements. A PQS was created for each enemy type, and made small changes to their behaviors easier to implement. The decision to create high-quality reactive AI for Noctis' companions helped influence the choice of making Noctis the only playable character. Business=Announcement A screenshot from the original trailer for Final Fantasy Versus XIII, showing Noctis displaying his powers. The initial trailers would continue to influence development goals for the game despite story and gameplay changes. Versus XIII was originally announced at the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) through a CGI trailer. The trailer, which showed Noctis advancing on a group of enemy soldiers, was created by Visual Works as a representation of what the development team were aiming for. The trailer also featured a quote from William Shakespeare's Hamlet: is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\\" This quote was intended to evoke the atmosphere Nomura was aiming for. After its initial announcement, the title was absent from multiple gaming events for several successive years, although a video showing an extended version of the reveal trailer was released in 2007 at a fan event. Two trailers were released in 2008, including in-game footage at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show (TGS). Footage of navigation was shown at TGS the following year in a closed theater. Its appearance at E3 2010 was apparently prevented due to multiple technical issues. Its final appearance as Versus XIII was at a Square Enix Press Conference in January 2011, appearing alongside other video games then in production. Because of its sporadic appearances in the public eye and its absence after the 2011 event, industry commentators labeled Final Fantasy XV as vaporware while it was still known as Versus XIII. In June 2012, it was rumored that the game had been cancelled, which was swiftly refuted by Wada. After that, further rumors emerged claiming that it had either been quietly cancelled, or renamed and shifted to another platform during development. Its name and platform change were officially announced at E3 2013, with further trailers showcasing the game concept released later. The 2013 trailer was again a concept piece consisting mostly of CGI rather than actual gameplay footage. Staff later stated that XV had been announced and displayed too early. The game's next official appearance was made at TGS 2014, with the announcement of its commercial demo, and a tech demo showing off the game's engine. After its reappearance, regular livestreamed shows called \\"Active Time Reports\\" (ATR) were broadcast, giving updates to the game and responses to fan questions. According to Tabata, the ATRs were created to help fans left confused by the game's change of platform and title, along with establishing a two-way communication with the fanbase. During 2015, official forums were created to allow the developers to receive direct feedback from fans. Starting from February 12, the Japanese forums were discontinued and replaced with a developer's blog. Their stated reason was to offer a more accessible medium for both feedback and developer updates. After its appearance at the 2014 Paris Games Week, Tabata announced that XVs release window was \\"roughly decided\\", with the company recruiting new staff to work on the master build. While it did not show at E3 2015, it did appear at that year's Gamescom, which Tabata said was the beginning of its official marketing campaign leading up to further announcements. As part of the marketing, the game was distanced from the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, as it would have placed symbolic limits upon their target audience. The game's minimal showing at the event caused a negative reaction from fans, with Tabata stating that Square Enix underestimated the importance of the event. Between May and November 2015, the publicity was deliberately kept low-key so staff could focus on completing the pre-beta version of the game. Once done, XV became playable in its entirety, enabling developers to get a full view of the product for the final stages of development and testing. Production on the beta version and progression to the debugging phase began in 2016. The master version, the version of the game that would be played at release, was completed in August, although further technical polishing took place after this. Demos During its TGS 2014 presentation, the real-time demonstration footage was dubbed Final Fantasy XV: The Overture, which demonstrated the graphic capabilities in Luminous Studio and the effect of environmental changes on gameplay. While it was intended as a one-off presentation, the team said they were considering creating a second demo for release in Japan based on The Overture. A demo featuring the battle against the Astral Titan was featured at E3 2016: while drawing on a part of the game, the fight was tailored for the demo so it could be completed within a ten- minute window, with the full version having different victory requirements. A Japan-exclusive commercial demo dubbed Judgement Disc was released on November 11. Spanning the game's events up to the middle of the first chapter, it was designed to allow players to judge the game's merits. The game also received an international demo titled Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae. The idea behind Episode Duscae was to give players a personal look at the game due to its long absence from the public eye, as well as demonstrate its gameplay and the fact that it was being actively developed. It was named after one of the regions in the game. The demo is set during the opening segment of XV, where the party temporarily lose their car and must gather funds for its repair by taking on jobs in the region. Gameplay and main story elements were tailored for a demo experience. One of the features left out was the ability for players to rent Chocobos, while the battle system was a slimmed-down version of what was planned for the final game, using the originally planned preset weapon deck feature. The character Cindy was also included. A summon with a simplified method of acquirement was also put into the game: originally intended to be Titan, it was replaced with Ramuh due to the former being a key character in the story. After TGS 2014, where Episode Duscae was first announced, Tabata and the team adjusted the gameplay experience based on fan feedback. The original plan was for a large area of the worldmap that players could explore using the car. While the ability to drive the party's car was originally included, it was later cut as Tabata feared that the feature would be too new for older fans of the series, who might have mistaken XV for \\"a driving game\\". The team decided to focus on the characters and environment. The demo included English and Japanese audio for all regions. The demo released in all regions alongside the physical and digital releases of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. The physical version was exclusive to day-one editions of Type-0 HD, while the digital version was valid for two months after purchase. The code had to be redeemed within one year of purchase. While players could save their progress in the demo, save data could not be carried over to the main game. Despite this, the team announced its intention to create a bonus for those who purchased the demo. A patch titled Episode Duscae 2.0 was released in June 2015, which included enhancements for the camera and controls, fixes for bugs, and adjustments to gameplay. The demo ran on Version 1.5 of Luminous Studio. Final Fantasy XV Universe The key visual for the original net animation series Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV, a part of the multimedia \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\". Brotherhood, together with the CGI feature film Kingsglaive, enabled the expansion of story and characters while keeping Final Fantasy XV as a single video game. Sequels to Final Fantasy XV were hinted at with the line \\"A World of the Versus Epic\\" in the E3 2013 trailer. Nomura explained that the game had a self-contained climax and that it was the first part of an intended continued epic. He said that Square Enix was considering using online elements and developing shorter stand-alone titles to keep players interested and to avoid long waiting times for them. This was interpreted as a move of the company towards a digitally distributed episodic format for possible sequels. Nomura later clarified at the Japan Expo 2013 that no plans for sequels had been finalized. Later, Tabata stated in interviews that Final Fantasy XV would be released as a single complete experience, and that no sequel was planned. In addition, there were no plans for multiple endings or a cliffhanger ending, with Tabata citing the XIII trilogy as a video game narrative style they were trying not to emulate. Despite this wish, the scale of XVs world and story would have needed multiple games to tell the entire story. To avoid turning Final Fantasy XV into a series of games, the team instead produced additional media surrounding XV, turning it into a multimedia project: while the main game could be enjoyed on its own, the other media could be used as introductions to the setting for newcomers. This project is being referred by Square Enix as the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\". According to Tabata, the Universe is split into two halves; media designed to reach a wider audience than the game might manage alone, and additional game-related content such as ports to other hardware and DLC. A free tech demo, Platinum Demo: Final Fantasy XV released on March 30, 2016. Birthed from the initial announced wish to develop a second tech demo and forming part of the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\", Platinum Demo was created in two months using completed assets from the main game. First announced in January 2016, it was designed to showcase the game's graphics and physics, along with elements of its final combat system. Set in a dream world after Noctis is gravely wounded as a child, it follows his journey back to consciousness, guided by a creature called Carbuncle that protects Noctis. Players who completed the demo are able to name Carbuncle in the main game. According to Tabata, Platinum Demo served a dual purpose: it both introduced players to the gameplay mechanics, and gave them insight into Noctis' young life and his relationship with his father. It was originally intended to be a less emotive experience, but changed to being story-driven to better introduce players to the game's world. The demo was removed from sale on March 31, 2017. A virtual reality-based fishing simulation game titled Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV was released in November 2017. Suggested by Sony Interactive Entertainment and originally a first-person shooter featuring Prompto and based on the storyline of Episode Duscae, the project was reworked into its current form to promote immersion and entertainment. The two major parts of the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\" were the original net animation series Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV and the CGI feature film Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV. Brotherhood was produced by Square Enix and A-1 Pictures and was released through the game's official YouTube channel and anime streaming website Crunchyroll between March and September 2016. Each episode details the backstory of Noctis from his childhood to the game's opening, along with the backstories of his companions. The first and last episodes of the anime tie in with the Platinum Demo. The anime is intended to give people a view into Noctis' mind that would have appeared incongruous within the context of a video game. Kingsglaive was a joined production shared between the original staff of Advent Children and multiple Western companies including Digic Pictures, who had worked on the graphics for the Assassin's Creed series; and Image Engine, who had worked on multiple films including Jurassic World and the television series Game of Thrones. While similar in appearance to Advent Children, Kingsglaive had a different goal behind its development: while Advent Children was made for dedicated fans of Final Fantasy VII, Kingsglaive was made as an introduction for newcomers to the world of XV, along with conveying some of Regis' backstory. Digic Pictures later collaborated with Square Enix on \\"Omen\\", a promotional trailer based on the world and story of Final Fantasy XV. To promote the game, and also forming part of the collection, a mobile app titled Justice Monsters Five was developed. Based on an arcade-style mini-game from XV, it used gameplay similar to the Monster Strike series and incorporated classic Final Fantasy monsters. Justice Monsters Five was released on August 30 for mobile platforms, and eventually shut down on March 27, 2017, seven months after its initial release. A planned Windows 10 version was not released. A second promotional item was A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV, released through GameStop and EB Games in North America as a free pre-order bonus. Playing as an arcade-style beat 'em up, A King's Tale relates King Regis' exploits thirty years before the game's events, told to the young Noctis by Regis as fairy tales. A King's Tale was later made available for free for PS4 and Xbox One on March 1, 2017. In addition, another mobile game titled King's Knight: Wrath of the Dark Dragon released in 2017. It is a remake of the 1986 game, and was available in XV as a game Noctis and his friends play. Square Enix and Machine Zone collaborated on a massively multiplayer online role-playing game for mobile devices based on the content of XV, first released on June 28, 2017. Titled Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire and developed by Machine Zone's subsidiary Epic Action, the game involves players taking the role of characters from Final Fantasy XV and fighting other player armies in real-time battles for control of the Crystal. Release The game's year of release was officially announced at the 2015 PAX Prime event, with its release date set to be revealed at a special event the following year. Another announcement from that time was that Tabata was aiming for a simultaneous worldwide release, a first for the Final Fantasy series. This was later clarified by Tabata at the 2016 Taipei Game Show: Square Enix was aiming to release the game within the same time period across the world, although there might be minor variations depending on regions. The special event, called \\"Uncovered: Final Fantasy XV\\", took place on March 30 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, hosted by internet celebrities Greg Miller and Tim Gettys. The event was livestreamed worldwide. Free limited tickets for the event were made available on February 5 for North American residents. By the next day, all tickets had been claimed. Its former release date, September 30, 2016, was announced on the first day of the event. According to Tabata, this release date was decided upon in 2013 based on projected development time and costs. In August, rumors began circulating that Final Fantasy XV had been delayed by two months. Tabata later confirmed that the game's worldwide release had been delayed to November 29: alongside the announcement was an official apology to fans for the delay. The reason he gave was that, while the game had reached fully playable form, the team was not satisfied with the overall quality they were aiming for, so the extra time would be dedicated to polishing XV further. In addition, he wanted to give players without an online connection the full experience without needing a Day One patch. Tabata confirmed in a later interview that he was the one who requested the extension after the master disc had been created for mass distribution. Patches following the initial release allowed support for the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X models, featuring enhanced graphics, resolution and framerate. =Localization= The English localization of XV was led by Dan Inoue. One of the aspects of the localization was using different accents to show the characters coming from different regions of the world: a cited example was Ignis, who spoke with a British accent while the other main characters spoke with an American accent. For the game's lore, the team made a conscious effort to move away from the esoteric terminology Final Fantasy had gained a reputation for. They used understandable names like \\"Astral\\" and \\"Daemon\\". To stop the lore becoming uninteresting, the divine beings' speech was made very impersonal‚Äîsuch as Gentiana not using \\"I\\" or \\"You\\" during her dialogue‚Äîand using interpretive dialogue for simple concepts. Different issues raised later included Ignis' localized lines, which changed aspects of the character interaction, and the alteration of Cindy's name from the original \\"Cidney\\". In an interview with Famitsu during Gamescom, Tabata revealed that the main reason for the delays in XVs release were related to the game's localization and debugging, as the team wanted to bring the game out in the west close to its Japanese release. The decision for a simultaneous release meant the localization had to happen alongside the game production, with no extra time for tweaks and corrections. In addition to being released with French and German dubs and text translation for those respective regions, it was also localized for Latin America with Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese text: this was the first time a Final Fantasy title was localized into these languages. One of the early issues, which drew public attention with the release of Episode Duscae, was Noctis' English voice actor. In Episode Duscae, his voice was pitched rather low, making the character seem older and less energetic than his Japanese counterpart. This was explained as being due to tight scheduling removing the opportunity for Tabata to catch the issue and re-record before it was time for release. After Episode Duscae, the voice work was redone to better convey Noctis' personality. The localization methods also ended up backfiring due to the dialogue matching mechanism for characters causing line repetition or omission. They also needed to deal with the clash between normal dialogue and the fantastic elements, which threatened to undermine the narrative. This forced the different pieces of media to take different approaches, and some scripted character interactions to join up the different sides of the narrative. =Versions and editions= In addition to the standard release, Day One, Deluxe, and Ultimate Collector's Editions were announced. The former contained a copy of XV, an exclusive \\"Masamune\\" sword, and platform-specific elements such as Xbox Live avatars and PS4 themes. The Deluxe Edition additionally included a copy of Kingsglaive on Blu-ray, a steelbook case featuring Amano's official artwork, and promotional content in the form of an additional outfit for Noctis, and a recolor of their vehicle. The latter edition included the content of the Deluxe Edition, alongside a Blu-ray release of Brotherhood, a special soundtrack, a hardcover artbook, further promotional content in the form of in-game items, and a Play Arts Kai figurine of Noctis. Preorders opened on March 30, and the Ultimate Collector's Edition was limited to a 30,000 unit print run. A further 10,000 copies of the Japanese Ultimate Collector's Edition were produced due to increased demand, alongside further copies for North America and Europe. The limited quantity was due to the difficulties producing Noctis' figurine. No further additional shipments were created. In a collaboration with Sony, Square Enix produced a themed PS4 console bundle: dubbed the \\"Luna Edition\\", it came with the console, a copy of the game, a copy of Kingsglaive, and multiple pieces of DLC. The bundle was available in Japan, North America and Europe alongside the game: in North America, it was exclusive to GameStop. Europe also received a standard edition bundle with a plain PS4 console. Digital premium editions for PS4 and Xbox One featured added in-game items such as weapons and cosmetic elements for both the game and the console. Both versions also came with a season pass, allowing free access to DLC. Later, a \\"Royal Edition\\" was released on March 8, 2018, concurrent with the Windows version. The game includes all DLC released up to that point along with additional content including new boss fights, story sequences and lore. The Royal Edition content was also released as separate DLC for standard editions. A version for personal computers (PC) running the Windows 10 operating system was released on March 6, 2018 through Steam and Origin. Titled Final Fantasy XV: Windows Edition and developed in cooperation with Nvidia using an upgraded version of the Luminous Studio engine, the game includes multiple graphical enhancements, and comes packaged with all free and paid DLC released up to that point. A port for the streaming-based Stadia platform was released on November 19, 2019 as a launch title. It was developed in-house by Luminous Productions. The Stadia release featured all accompanying DLC and expansion material, and exclusive challenge missions. On May 21, 2020, the console version was made available in Japan through NTT Docomo's subscription service for streaming on mobile phones. A remake tailored to mobile devices titled Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition was also released in 2017. Released for iOS, Android and through Windows Store, it carries over the core story and gameplay while using a different artstyle and touch controls catered to a casual gaming audience. The story plays out across ten episodes; the first episode is free, while the rest must be purchased separately. The game was later released as Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition HD for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 7, 2018, and for the Nintendo Switch on September 13. The Switch version was the first Final Fantasy to appear on the platform. =Downloadable content= A Day One DLC patch was created regardless called the \\"Crown update\\". In addition to gameplay updates such as galleries and the ability to summon monsters to fight, CGI scenes from Kingsglaive and the \\"Omen\\" trailer were added, and social media functionality was incorporated to allow photos taken in-game to be uploaded on Facebook and Twitter. The content was the result of added development following the completion of the game. Following the game's release, Square Enix received feedback on aspects relating to its story content and a sequence during Chapter 13 of the main story, where the gameplay style and difficulty shifted drastically. To this end, Square Enix announced free DLC updates that would tweak the gameplay of Chapter 13 and add further story-based cutscenes to expand upon character motivations left unexplained in the base game. The amendments to Chapter 13 and other late-game portions of Final Fantasy XV were released on March 28, 2017. Two notable limited time events were developed for the game. The \\"Moogle Chocobo Carnival\\", a carnival event with minigames themed around the Final Fantasy series Chocobo and Moogle mascots, ran from January to February 2017. The Carnival was brought back between July to August of that year. From August 2017 to January 2018, the game featured a collaboration with Ubisoft title Assassin's Creed Origins, with a story quest and special accessories themed after the game. A particular item which unlocked a themed costume during the event was offered during the second Chocobo Carnival. The collaboration also saw elements from Final Fantasy XV included in Assassin's Creed Origins. A later notable collaboration was a free playable mission featuring Noctis teaming up with Sarah, the protagonist of the Mistwalker-developed Terra Wars. The mission released alongside accessories for Comrades themed after Shadow of the Tomb Raider. One of the last collaborations was with Final Fantasy XIV, where Noctis and his party fight the summon Garuda. The planned DLC included a weapon pack, three story episodes that make Noctis' companions playable, and was termed an \\"Online Expansion Pack\\". The latter is an expansion that allows online multiplayer battles with up to four players. Titled \\"Comrades\\", it takes place the ten-year gap in the game's narrative, focusing on player- created members of the Kingsglaive combating powerful monsters. With the release of \\"Comrades\\", Final Fantasy XV became the first mainline single- player Final Fantasy game to feature multiplayer content. A standalone version of \\"Comrades\\" released on December 13, 2018; this version included ten new bosses and several other expansions. With the standalone version's release, the original version would cease functioning and those who had purchased it would receive the new version for free. A planned PC version was cancelled, but the PC version of the original \\"Comrades\\" would continue to function. The online functions will be shut down in June 2020. \\"Episode Gladiolus\\" released on March 28, 2017; featuring Gladiolus as a playable character, the scenario also featured recurring Final Fantasy character Gilgamesh. Following his defeat by Ravus Nox Fleuret, Gladiolus leaves the party to grow his strength under Cor Leonis' guidance while challenging Gilgamesh. \\"Episode Prompto\\" was released on June 27; featuring Prompto as a playable character and taking place during a late-game narrative gap while Prompto left the party, the gameplay shifts towards third-person shooting and stealth-based mechanics. \\"Episode Ignis\\" was released on December 13; set following a key story event, the episode follows Ignis as he teams up with supporting character Ravus Nox Fleuret to protect Noctis. \\"Episode Ignis\\" was planned to be the last installment of post-release DLC. Due to popular demand, the team decided to extend DLC support into 2018, focusing on content to expand character stories and the world's lore. \\"Episode Ardyn\\" released on March 26, 2019. A short anime feature titled Episode Ardyn Prologue, detailing Ardyn's original fall, was released on February 12. Set thirty years prior to the main game, \\"Episode Ardyn\\" details how Ardyn was found by Niflheim and began his plot of revenge against the Lucis bloodline. Planning for \\"Episode Ardyn\\" originated in Episode Ardyn Prologue, which was decided upon following a 2017 pole about which character should receive additional content. At that point, DLC was scheduled to end with \\"Episode Ignis\\", so an anime was chosen as its format. The anime short was produced by Satelight under Square Enix's supervision. Once the decision was made to continue the DLC, they decided to further explore Ardyn's backstory in a playable form. According to its lead staff, the aim was to show more emotion in Ardyn. More acrobatic gameplay from \\"Episode Ignis\\" was incorporated into \\"Episode Ardyn\\". \\"Episode Ardyn\\" marks the end of post-release support for Final Fantasy XV. The Dawn of the Future \\"Episode Ardyn\\" was to be part of a four-episode scenario dubbed The Dawn of the Future, with three episodes focusing on Noctis, Lunafreya and supporting character Aranea. The Dawn of the Future was to expand upon the base narrative and offer a new scenario where the group defy their predetermined fates to create an ideal future. Due to Tabata's decision to leave and subsequent changes within the development team, all but \\"Episode Ardyn\\" were cancelled in November of that year. Instead, the scrapped content and \\"Episode Ardyn\\" were turned into a novel of the same name, written for long-term fans of the game to provide closure for the project and its universe. The novel was written by Emi Nagashima, who had written supplementary materials for Final Fantasy XIII and Nier Automata, based on the DLC draft. The novel released in Japan in April 2019; An English version will release in June 2020 Square Enix Books & Manga, a publishing imprint of Square Enix created in partnership with Penguin Random House.

Kubity is powered by several proprietary 3D processing engines including \\"Paragone\\" and \\"Etna\\" that prepare the 3D file for transfer over mobile devices. Kubity has practical applications for architecture, interior design, engineering, product design, film and video games among others. The majority of its users create 3D models using SketchUp or Autodesk Revit software. Kubity products include the Kubity web app and Kubity Go (a mobile application for iOS and Android). Kubity is compatible across many platforms, devices and operating systems including: iOS, Android, Firefox, Chrome, Windows, MacOS and Linux.  History  Kubity was created by SPK Technology (ex Kubity S.A.S.), a Paris-based software company specializing in automatic 3D data optimization and visualization. Founded in 2012 by a group of software engineers and an urban projects developer, they united around a simple idea: create a way for anyone, anywhere to simply and intuitively explore 3D models on smartphones and computers. In order to bring architects, engineers and designers together with their clients around a 3D model, it was essential to develop an interactive platform that supported multiple desktop and mobile devices for instantaneous and fluid 3D navigation. With specifications in place, 15 engineers fused together several technologies: 3D design, data compression, decimation and rendering optimization, web and mobile transfer, and virtual reality headset integration. In January 2014, the first public Kubity prototype (1.0 Amethyst) was launched to a small group of beta testers with a plug-in that allowed users to import 3D models from SketchUp to their browser.https://www.rudebaguette.com/2014/08/06/interview-kubity-cofounder- ceo-romain-gora-discusses-plans-make-communication-via-3d-accessible/ A global release was announced in April 2014 at the SketchUp Basecamp in Vail, Colorado. In May 2015, Kubity launched a web application that worked using WebGL technology (2.0 Citrine). For the first time, users were able to drag and drop any SketchUp file in a web browser without having to install a plug- in.http://forums.sketchup.com/t/kubity-su-rendered-model-sharing- free/10637http://portal.babelx3d.net/content/sharing-sketchup-files-kubity In December 2015, Kubity launched a mobile application on the App Store for iPhone, iPod, and iPad as well as on Google Play for Android devices (3.0 Druzy). In November 2016, Kubity launched support for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive (4.0 Emerald). Beginning in November 2017, Kubity launched a full suite rollout of mobile applications over six months that included Kubity AR for augmented reality, Kubity VR for virtual reality, and Kubity Mirror for remote presentations and screen mirroring (5.0 Feldspar). In September 2018, a one- click plugin for SketchUp and Revit (Kubity PRO), along with a mobile-first revamp of Kubity Go was launched, allowing PRO-to-Go device pairing for automatic mobile sync (6.0 Gypsum). In early 2019, the Kubity Go application was updated to include fully integrated AR, VR, and screen mirroring functionalities, killing off the dedicated companion apps Kubity AR, Kubity VR and Kubity Mirror in the process (7.0 Heliotrope). In January 2020, support for the Kubity PRO plugin for SketchUp and Revit was migrated to a SketchUp- only web app.  Technology  Kubity is powered by a proprietary 3D crystallization engine known as \\"Paragone\\"; a technology developed by SPK Technology. Paragone takes constrained information from a 3D file and runs it through the \\"BlockWave\\" algorithm (US Patent 10,482.629), also developed by SPK Technology. BlockWave is a multiphase optimization algorithm that combines 3D design, data compression, decimation and rendering optimization, web and mobile transfer, and mixed reality headset integration to create a crystallized universal format of the original file. One phase of the BlockWave algorithm is based on the quadric-based polygonal surface simplification algorithm, performed using predefined heuristics, and is associated with a plurality of simplified versions of the 3D model, each version being associated with a predefined level of detail adapted to the user specific end device. BlockWave extracts data content, geometry and textures, then sets quadrics for each top of the original 3D model, and identifies pairs of adjacent tops linked by vertices. The algorithm uses a local collapsing operator and a top-plan error metric to obtain a fixed number of faces or a maximum defined error; 3D meshing is simplified by replacing two points with one, then deleting the degrading faces and updating adjacent relations. Once decimation is completed, texture optimization is set using texture target parameters allowing maximized GPU memory to improve computing time. With texture encoding completed, the crystallized universal 3D file can now be easily opened on any user-specific end device and played across most digital devices with real-time rendering.  Features = 3D Crystallization  A user converts (or crystallizes) a 3D file by exporting it with the Kubity web app. Crystallization adds features like AR/VR and cinematic fly-through tour as well as assigns the model a dedicated QR code.  Automatic Mobile Sync  When a 3D model is exported, it is automatically synced to Kubity Go on the user's mobile device. From there, it can be accessed, explored, and shared with others with or without an internet connection.  Security and Management  User models can be managed all in one place on Kubity Go or in a browser from their account. Models can be renamed, password-protected, shared, and played.  Augmented Reality  Developed using Apple ARKit and Google ARCore technology, Kubity Go's augmented reality feature maps the environment in a room detecting horizontal planes like tables and floors to track and place 3D objects. By blending digital objects and information with the environment, Kubity allows users to interact with 3D models in true augmented reality. Built-in communication features allows users to instantly share 3D models with anyone over text, email, social media, or direct device- to-device with a QR Code. Platform Support AR supports devices running iOS11 including: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone X, all iPad Pro models, and iPad (2017). AR for Android requires Android 7.0 or later and access to the Google Play Store. A full list of compatible devices is found on the ARCore developer website.  Virtual Reality  VR allows users to explore SketchUp models and Revit projects on- the-go right from a mobile device using Oculus Go, Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR, or the glasses-free Magic Window feature. Kubity's virtual reality feature is compatible with Oculus Go, Google Cardboard viewers and other cardboard compatible devices including clip-on style VR glasses like Homido Mini, as well as the mobile virtual reality headset, Samsung Gear VR. Samsung Gear VR supports: Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge+, Samsung Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, Samsung Galaxy Note Fan Edition, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Samsung Galaxy A8/A8+ (2018) and Samsung Galaxy S9/Galaxy S9+.  Screen Mirroring  Screen mirroring allows a user to sync the sender device to a receiver on the webpage mirror.kubity.com, then control from the sender device to give a remote presentation of the 3D model. Devices are easily synced by entering a six-digit number displayed on the receiving computer.  Platform support  On iOS, the Kubity application is compatible with devices running on the version 9.0 or higher. On Android, Kubity is compatible with devices running on the version 4.4 ‚ÄúKit Kat‚Äù or higher.

Design and construction The Class 690 was designed just as the superheater technology was becoming available, allowing the FS to discard what had been a widespread feature on many Italian locomotives, the compound engine, deeming the advantages of the more simple single-expansion engine coupled with superheated steam to be superior. The English author Peter Michael Kalla-Bishop claims that, just before the production run, a prototype (numbered FS 6901) was built with a number of different features, but was so unsuccessful that it was withdrawn and quietly scrapped after just a few months. However, there is no reference for this claim, which is not repeated in any other document. The first nine locomotives, all with right-hand drive, were built in 1911 by Ernesto Breda (6) and the Officine Meccaniche (3); the following twenty-four, built in 1914 by Breda (14) and Gio. Ansaldo & C. (10) had left-hand drive. All of them had been designed for an axle load of 18 tons, but since this value was too high for even the current mainline railways, they all entered service with the load on the driving wheels lightened to 17.1 tons. They were the first Italian four-cylinder simple- expansion locomotives that had the feature of having the adjacent cylinders paired together and both served by a single piston valve through crossed ports (a feature shared by the more numerous Class 685). The firebox had to be placed between the rearmost driving wheels and was therefore of trapezoidal shape and relatively small; this feature would prove to be the locomotive's weakness, as it caused poor steaming and was expensive to maintain. Operations Limited by their high axle load to the Milan-Venice and Milan- Bologna-Florence mainlines, the Class 690 did not prove to be satisfactory, as its poor steaming qualities greatly hampered the performance. While fast (being the first Italian locomotive certified for a mainline top speed of and powerful in absolute terms, relatively speaking its performance was modest ‚Äì 1400 CV at 90 km/h ( at ), while the Class 685 (which was smaller and had a shorter boiler) had a power of 1250 CV at 75 km/h ( at ). As a result, by the end of the 1920s a new three-cylinders Pacific locomotive (to be classified as Class 695) was designed; however, although more powerful than the Class 690, it would have required considerable strengthening of bridges and other infrastructures of the railways it was supposed to work on, because of an axle load of 21 tons. Therefore, a less ambitious plan to rebuild the Class 690 by replacing the boiler and firebox with those of the FS Class 746 was approved. From 1928 to 1934 all thirty-three locomotives were rebuilt into the new Class 691. References 690-2 4-6-2 locomotives Gio.

This academic establishment provides training and education to Belgian and Netherlands Navy crewmembers in charge of minehunting, as well as to Naval Mine Warfare officers from NATO and PfP countries. History The Naval Barracks of Ostend were established during Dutch rule (1815‚Äì1830). In June 1956, the first stone of the Naval Mine Warfare School was laid during a ceremony in the presence of His Royal Highness Prince Albert of Belgium within the military zone of Ostend. The School was officially inaugurated in June 1960. Since 1965, the School has offered courses on mine warfare for the Belgian and Netherlands Navies. In 1975 it was formally established as an integrated bi-national Belgian-Netherlands organization, and began offering courses for NATO partners. In 2006, EGUERMIN was accredited by the North Atlantic Council as a NATO Naval Mine Warfare Centre of Excellence. Mission The school's primary mission is to provide education and training to crewmembers of the Belgian Navy and the Royal Netherlands Navy. The school is also open to other NATO countries and international partners. The subjects taught cover technique, tactics, procedures and doctrine to counter naval mines. Every year more than five hundred students attend classes. Education=Bi-national education EGUERMIN is in charge of both instruction and training of Belgian and Netherlands personnel. Bi-national courses are designed to form the future sonar operators, assistant minehunting officers, minehunting officers and commanding officers of the Belgian and Netherlands mine countermeasures vessels. Instruction is composed of a theoretical part and of a practical part executed in a simulator reproducing the operational room of a minehunter. The crews are then trained at sea during an operational sea training for which EGUERMIN specifically trains the personnel on mine countermeasures (MCM) procedures and evaluate the capacity of the crew to prepare and execute properly an MCM operation. International education The school delivers education to officers from NATO and non-NATO countries. These are designed to form Staff Naval Mine Warfare officers or to give a general mine warfare awareness to the students. Gaming System The school disposes of a Naval Mine Warfare Gaming System capable of simulating the interaction between the threat caused by naval mines and the mine countermeasures assets when executing a campaign in an imaginary scenario. This gaming system is designed to offer an advanced training on naval mine warfare to NATO forces. The Naval Mine Warfare Gaming System (NMWGS) creates a confrontation between the Naval Minefield planner and the Naval Mine Counter Measures (NMCM) Commander, the objective of the NMWGS is to provide instruction and training for Naval Mine Warfare Staff Officers in the areas of NMCM planning, decision-making and evaluation. The instruction and training is primarily given on the NMCM Tasking Authority level, eventually complemented by a superior command level. Each year, over 200 NMCM staff officers train and exercise on the NMWGS as part of: * The annual NATO Computer Assisted Exercise DYNAMIC MOVE * The EGUERMIN NATO Principal Warfare Officer NMW and Staff Officer NMW courses; * A wargaming period during a national NMW course (e.g. UK, NOR, DEU); * A dedicated NMCM Staff Team Training (e.g. UK MCM squadrons, NLMARFOR) thumb ReferencesExternal links * Official Website * Official Website of the Belgian Navy * Official Website of the Netherlands Royal Navy Belgian Navy Royal Netherlands Navy ","title":"Eguermin"},{"id":"48467307","text":"Paolo Sassanelli (born 29 October 1958) is an Italian stage, film and television actor as well as director.

It was elevated to the rank of minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009. History A Romanesque church dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin already existed on the current site of the basilica in the 12th century. This earlier structure may have featured a wooden-roofed nave. It was a priory church founded by and dependent upon the Abbey of Lonlay (for which the commune in which it is located, Lonlay-l'Abbaye, is named). Later it became parish church, and was enlarged for the purpose. Construction on the nave of the current structure began as early as before the Hundred Years' War (1337‚Äì1453). Aisles were added onto the nave in about 1470, and substantial work on the fabric of the church continued until the early 16th century. In about the year 1500, during the time of the Blessed Margaret of Lorraine, a new master builder, Jehan Lemoine, made substantial changes to the architectural project of the church. He built the elaborate Porch of the Transfiguration on its west side, and decorated the nave with its current star-patterned vaults and richly-decorated ribs, supported on the outside by two ranks of flying buttresses. At that time, side chapels were placed between the abutments of the buttresses. The end result was a Gothic structure characteristic of late-Medieval Norman architecture, but it underwent later transformations. The decoration of the portal, for example, was defaced during the Wars of Religion (1562‚Äì1598). Also, in August 1744, lightning struck the wooden bell tower and the resulting fire destroyed the choir and transepts. The engineer Jean-Rodolphe Perronet rebuilt those parts of the church between 1745 and 1762, constructing the squat steeple at the crossing. Further damage was done during the French Revolution, when the church was looted and devastated, such that by the middle of the 19th century, it threatened to fall into ruin. Subsequent restoration campaigns, however, succeeded in saving the church. Connection to the Martin family Saints Louis and Z√©lie Martin, the parents of Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, were married in the church on 13 July 1858, and it was there that Th√©r√®se received the sacrament of baptism on 4 January 1873. The baptismal gown used for the ceremony is displayed in the basilica as a relic for the veneration of the faithful, and a stained glass window in the baptistry commemorates the ceremony. Finally, Z√©lie's funeral was held there after her death in 1877. By virtue of its connection with the Martin family and in recognition of its status as a place of pilgrimage, the church was designated a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI on 10 August 2009. Architecture Pipe organ of the Basilica of Notre-Dame d'Alen√ßon The architectural sources for the construction of Notre-Dame d'Alen√ßon are to be found in churches such as La Trinit√© de Falaise, Saint-Germain d'Argentan, and Saint-Maclou in Rouen. The church is constructed in the shape of a Latin cross, in three sections. The central nave of five bays is supported by strong fasciculated columns with reduced capitals, indicative of early 15th-century construction, and rising in three storeys. The aisles are covered by rib vaults, while the main nave is decorated with star-patterned tierceron vaults with ridge rib and tufty foliage sprigs. The supporting pillars of the nave are cylindrical, with attached sharp-edged fillet moldings. In the arcade, single fillets are topped by a foliate capitals that also cap the cylindrical core of the piers. The arcade and bay divisions shows both disappearing and continuous moldings, both of which are elements of Late Gothic articulation. The middle level of the nave's elevation is a blind triforium with a lower balustrade; the broad clerestory windows are decorated with flamboyant tracery. Off the nave are side aisles, which were added on in the 15th century, and side chapels added in the sixteenth. The sanctuary, with its transepts and choir, are the result of an 18th-century rebuilding. The three-sided western porch is especially notable, dating from the start of the 16th century and executed in flamboyant Gothic style. The program of stained glass, dating from the Renaissance era, depicts Old Testament scenes on the north side of the basilica, and on the south side, scenes from the life of the Blessed Virgin. Although the glass has undergone many restorations, it was not affected by the violence of the Second World War. During the 19th-century restoration of the church, stained glass windows for the chapels were created to match the historic windows of the nave. Those windows, installed in 1884, were damaged by bombing in 1944, and afterwards replaced between 1986 and 1996 by stained glass created by Flandrin and Courageux. The high altar is housed beneath a baldachin with gloria installed during the 18th-century replacement of the choir, the same era that furnished the baptismal font in the northern chapel. Above the altar, a monumental sculpture represents the Assumption of Mary and replaces a piet√† that was destroyed during the Revolution. A new pipe organ by Jean Daldosso was fitted in 2016 in the 1537 organ case.

It is the only major conference with C2 as its exclusive focus. The symposium has had papers not only on C2 in military contexts, but also in civilian ones such as disaster relief. ICCRTS has been widely attended by scientists and practitioners from the United States and a number of NATO countries, most commonly Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Turkey, but others as well. Regular participants have also come from Australia, Brazil, Finland, and Singapore. The symposium publishes proceedings with full-length, peer-reviewed scientific papers. Evolution and Current Status ICCRTS began in the 1990s as a program within Command and Control Research Program (CCRP) funded by the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Since 2015, the symposium has been operated by The International Command and Control Institute (IC2I), which also maintains archives of its publications.http://www.dodccrp-test.org A number of papers, particularly by U.S. authors, are also available to the public through the U.S. Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). At its peak in 2009-2011 ICCRTS had several hundred participants. However, the loss of explicit funding support from the United States Department of Defense in 2015 nearly killed the symposium. That year it had to be cancelled, even though people had already written and submitted their papers. The papers were nevertheless published in the Proceedings, and since 2016 under the aegis of the IC2I, the symposium has bounced back and stabilized, although at lower levels of participation than it enjoyed between 2009 and 2011. Details of Past Symposia Note that in earlier years, two symposia were sometimes held: the international one, known as ICCRTS; and a U.S. domestic one, known as CCRTS (Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium). The first ICCRTS in 1995 was in the United States and was modest in size (63 participants), with only a handful of non-U.S. participants. The 1996, 1997, and 1998 meetings were held in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Sweden, respectively.

Rugby union A hooker, McRobie represented, and often captained, at a provincial level between 1889 and 1896. In 1896 he became the first player from the Southland union to play for the New Zealand national side, when he appeared in a match against the touring Queensland team. That was his only game for New Zealand. He later served on the management committee of the New Zealand Rugby Union between 1900 and 1901. Printing and newspaper career After completing his printing apprenticeship, McRobie worked for The Press in Christchurch, The Timaru Herald, and The New Zealand Times in Wellington, becoming the factory manager for the latter newspaper in 1904. After a period managing the Pahiatua Herald, McRobie was appointed general manager of The New Zealand Times. In 1909 he purchased the Waihi Daily Times, but sold that publication in 1915, and moved to Auckland, where he became the manager of Business Printing Works Limited. McRobie served as president of the Auckland Master Printers' Association between 1916 and 1924, and was president of the New Zealand Master Printers' Federation from 1922 to 1924.

The software first gained widespread attention in September 2015, when a number of apps originating from China harbored the malicious code. It was thought to be the \\"first large-scale attack on Apple's App Store\\", according to the BBC. The problems were first identified by researchers at Alibaba, a leading e-commerce firm in China. Over 4000 apps are infected, according to FireEye, far more than the 25 initially acknowledged by Apple,https://www.fireeye.com/blog/executive- perspective/2015/09/protecting_our_custo.html including apps from authors outside China. Security firm Palo Alto Networks surmised that because network speeds were slower in China, developers in the country looked for local copies of the Apple Xcode development environment, and encountered altered versions that had been posted on domestic web sites. This opened the door for the malware to be inserted into high profile apps used on iOS devices. Even two months after the initial reports, security firm FireEye reported that hundreds of enterprises were still using infected apps and that XcodeGhost remained \\"a persistent security risk\\". The firm also identified a new variant of the malware and dubbed it XcodeGhost S; among the apps that were infected were the popular messaging app WeChat and a Netease app Music 163.  Discovery  On September 16, 2015, a Chinese iOS developer mentioned on the social network Sina Weibo that a malware in Xcode injects third party code into apps compiled with it. Alibaba researchers then published detailed information on the malware and called it XcodeGhost. On September 17, 2015, Palo Alto Networks published several reports on the malware.  Operation = Propagation  Because of the slow download speed from Apple servers, Chinese iOS developers would download Xcode from third party websites, such as Baidu Yun (now called Baidu WangPan), a cloud storage service hosted by Baidu, or get copies from co-workers. Attackers took advantage of this situation by distributing compromised versions on such file hosting websites. Palo Alto Networks suspects that the malware was available in March 2015.  Attack vector  Origins = Leaked document from Edward Snowden. \\"Strawhorse: Attacking the MacOS and iOS Software Development Kit\\". The attacker used a compiler backdoor attack. The novelty of this attack is the modification of the Xcode compiler. However, according to documents leaked by Edward Snowden, CIA security researchers from Sandia National Laboratories claimed that they \\"had created a modified version of Apple‚Äôs proprietary software development tool, Xcode, which could sneak surveillance backdoors into any apps or programs created using the tool.\\" = Modified files = Known versions of XcodeGhost add extra files to the original Xcode application: * Core service framework on iOS, iOS simulator and OS X platforms * IDEBundleInjection framework added on iOS, iOS simulator and OS X platforms XcodeGhost also modified the linker to link the malicious files into the compiled app. This step is reported on the compiling log but not on the Xcode IDE. Both iOS and OS X apps are vulnerable to XcodeGhost. = Deployment = XcodeGhost compromised the CoreServices layer, which contains highly used features and frameworks used by the app. When a developer compiles their application with a compromised version of Xcode, the malicious CoreServices are automatically integrated into the app without the developer's knowledge. Then the malicious files will add extra code in UIWindow class and UIDevice class. The UIWindow class is \\"an object that manages and coordinates the views an app displays on a device screen\\". The UIDevice class provides a singleton instance representing the current device. From this instance the attacker can obtain information about the device such as assigned name, device model, and operating-system name and version.  Behavior on infected devices  Remote control security risks = XcodeGhost can be remotely controlled via commands sent by an attacker from a Command and control server through HTTP. This data is encrypted using the DES algorithm in ECB mode. Not only is this encryption mode known to be weak, the encryption keys can also be found using reverse engineering. An attacker could perform a man in the middle attack and transmit fake HTTP traffic to the device (to open a dialog box or open specific app for example). = Stealing user device information = When the infected app is launched, either by using an iPhone or the simulator inside Xcode, XcodeGhost will automatically collect device information such as: * Current time * Current infected app's name * The app's bundle identifier * Current device's name and type * Current system's language and country * Current device's UUID * Network type Then the malware will encrypt those data and send it to a command and control server. The server differs from version to version of XcodeGhost; Palo Alto Networks was able to find three server URLs: * http://init.crash-analytics.com * http://init.icloud-diagnostics.com * http://init.icloud-analysis.com The last domain was also used in the iOS malware KeyRaider. = Read and write from clipboard = XcodeGhost is also able, each time an infected app is launched, to store the data written in the iOS clipboard. The malware is also able to modify this data. This can be particularly dangerous if the user uses a password management app. = Hijack opening specific URLs = XcodeGhost is also able to open specific URLs when the infected app is launched. Since Apple iOS and OS X work with Inter-App Communication URL mechanism (e.g. 'whatsapp://', 'Facebook://', 'iTunes://'), the attacker can open any apps installed on the compromised phone or computer, in the case of an infected macOS application. Such mechanism could be harmful with password management apps or even on phishing websites. = Prompting alert dialog = In its current known version XcodeGhost cannot prompt alert dialogs on the user device. However, it only requires minor changes. By using a UIAlertView class with the UIAlertViewStyleLoginAndPasswordInput property, the infected app can display a fake alert dialog box that looks like a normal Apple ID user credential check and send the input to the Command and control server.  Infected apps  Among all the Chinese apps, IMs app, banking apps, mobile carrier's app, maps, stock trading apps, SNS apps and games were infected. Popular apps used all over the world were also infected such as WeChat, a popular instant messaging app, CamScanner, an app to scan document using the smartphone camera or WinZip.

The plot follows two sisters who are invited to cage dive while on holiday in Mexico. When the winch system holding the cage breaks and the cage plummets to the ocean floor with the two girls trapped inside, they must find a way to escape, with their air supplies running low and great white sharks stalking nearby. The film was released in the United States on 16 June 2017, and in the United Kingdom on 26 July 2017. It received mixed reviews and was a box office success, grossing over $62 million worldwide against a budget of about $5 million. A sequel, titled 47 Meters Down: Uncaged, was released on August 16, 2019. The two films have grossed over $100 million worldwide. Plot Sisters Lisa (Mandy Moore) and Kate (Claire Holt) are on vacation in Mexico after Lisa's boyfriend recently broke up with her. They decide to go watch sharks from a diving cage with two local men. At the docks, Lisa is wary of the boat and its owner, Captain Taylor (Matthew Modine). Kate is a certified diver, but Lisa is new to diving. They lie to Taylor and tell him that Lisa is experienced. Unbeknownst to everyone, the cable supporting the cage is fraying. Taylor sends Lisa and Kate down, with some sort of futuristic masks by means of which they can talk to him on the surface and to each other. They are soon surrounded by great white sharks; however, the cable breaks, and the cage sinks to the bottom which is 47 meters below the surface and out of communication range with the boat. Kate swims up 7 meters to resume communication with Taylor, who tells her that Javier (Chris J. Johnson) will be coming down with a spare winch cable to attach to the cage. He advises them to stay in the cage because the sharks are close by. Both women are running out of air but soon see a flashlight in the distance. With Kate low on air from the previous swim, Lisa swims out to get Javier's attention. A shark tries to attack her but she avoids it. Lisa becomes disoriented about her position; Javier attempts to usher her back towards safety, but he is killed by a great white shark. Lisa takes his spear gun and the winch cable and swims back to the cage. The spare cable is attached but it also snaps and the cage sinks back down, landing on Lisa's leg and pinning her. Kate tells Taylor they are low on air and Lisa is trapped, he sends air tanks down and tells them the coast guard is an hour out, he also warns that the second tank may cause nitrogen narcosis, which can lead to hallucinations. Kate finds three flares to signal the coast guard. As she returns to the cage, she is attacked and (presumably) devoured by a great white shark. Lisa uses the spear from the spear gun to pull a tank toward her and dons it, getting more air. Kate is injured and her blood is attracting more sharks. Lisa uses her BCD to lift up the cage, freeing her leg; due to the nature of Kate's wounds, the sisters decide to swim to the surface, using one of the flares to scare off the sharks, at the 20-meter mark, Taylor reminds them they must wait five minutes to decompress and avoid the bends. Kate accidentally drops the second flare and lights the third, discovering that they are surrounded by sharks. Taylor yells for them to drop their gear and make a break for the surface, and they swim as fast as they can, one of the sharks bites Lisa's leg but she escapes, both women make it to the boat but Lisa is attacked again, she sticks her fingers in the shark's eye and it releases her. The men pull the sisters onto the boat, saving them. Then it is revealed that Lisa has been hallucinating all this time due to nitrogen narcosis and that she is still at the bottom of the ocean with her leg pinned under the cage. Coast guard divers arrive to rescue her and carry her to the surface whereas her sister has already been killed by the great white shark.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 55% overall positive score.

After winning his only start as a juvenile he emerged as a top-class performer in the following season: he won the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby) and three other Graded races as well as being placed in the Satsuki Sho, Kikuka Sho and the Japan Cup. He performed even better as a four-year-old in 1999 winning the Hanshin Daishoten, the spring and autumn editions of the Tenno Sho, and the Japan Cup. In the last-named race he defeated a strong international field including the winners of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and The Derby. He later became a successful breeding stallion siring the Japanese Horse of the Year Buena Vista. Background Special Week was a brown horse with a white blaze standing 16.1¬æ hands high, bred in Japan by Hidaka Taiyo Bokujo. He was sired by Sunday Silence, who won the 1989 Kentucky Derby, before retiring to stud in Japan where he was champion sire on thirteen consecutive occasions. His other major winners included Deep Impact, Stay Gold, Heart's Cry, Zenno Rob Roy and Neo Universe. Special Week's dam Campaign Girl was an unraced daughter of Maruzensky and was a great-granddaughter of the leading Japanese broodmare Shiraoki, whose other descendants have included Vodka, Kodama (Satsuki Sho, Tokyo Yushun), Shin Tsubame (Satsuki Sho), Matikanefukukitaru (Kikuka Sho) and Sister Tosho (Oka Sho). Campaign Girl died shortly after foaling Special Week and the colt had to be hand-fed by stable staff. During his racing career the colt was owned by Hiroyoshi Usuda, trained by Toshiaki Shirai and ridden in most of his races by Yutaka Take. Racing career=1997: two-year-old season On his only appearance as a two-year-old Special Week ran in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 19 November. He made a successful debut, beating thirteen opponents headed by Legacy Hunter. 1998: three-year-old season Special Week began his second season by finishing second to Asahi Creek in the Shiraume Sho over 1600 metres at Kyoto Racecourse in January. In the following month was moved up in class and distance for the Grade III Kisaragi Sho over 1800 metres at the same course and recorded his first major win, beating Bold Emperor and thirteen others. In March he was stepped up again for the Grade II Hochi Hai Yayoi Sho (the major trial race for the Satsuki Sho) over 2000 metres at Nakayama Racecourse and won from Seiun Sky and King Halo. In the Satsuki Sho over the same course and distance on 19 April he was unable to reproduce his earlier form and finished third, beaten half a length and a length by Seiun Sky and King Halo. On 7 June, Special Week was one of a field of eighteen colts, also including Seiun Sky and King Halo, to contest the Tokyo Yushun over 2400 metres at Tokyo Racecourse and was ridden as in most of his races by Yutaka Take. Special Week won by five lengths from Bold Emperor with Daiwa Superior taking third ahead of Seiun Sky. After a four-month break, Special Week returned in October for the Grade II Kyoto Shimbun Hai over 2200 metres on 18 October and won from King Halo. On 8 November he faced King Halo, Bold Emperor, Seiun Sky and Daiwa Superior in the Grade I Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres at Kyoto Racecourse. He finished second of the eighteen runners behind Seiun Sky, who won in a course record time 0f 3:03.2. On his final start of the season Special Week was matched against older horses for the first time in the Japan Cup at Tokyo on 29 November. Ridden by Yukio Okabe he started the 2.3/1 favourite in a fifteen-runner field which included challengers from Germany, Canada, the United States and Britain. He was in sixth place entering the straight and made steady progress in the closing stages to finish third behind El Condor Pasa and Air Groove. 1999: four-year-old season Special Week began his third season in the Grade II American Jockey Club Stakes at Nakayama on 24 January and won from Silent Hunter and Mejiro Steed. On 21 March at Hanshin he added another Grade II win when he defeated Mejiro Bright in the 3000 metre Hanshin Daishoten. The Grade I spring edition of the Tenno Sho over the same course and distance saw Special Week matched against eleven opponents including Mejiro Bright (winner of the race in 1998), Matikanefukukitaru, Seiun Sky, Stay Gold, Silk Justice (Arima Kinen). Special Week recorded his second Grade I win as he defeated Mejiro Bright by half a length with Seiun Sky two and a half lengths back in third. In the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres at Hanshin on 11 July, his final start before the summer break, Special Week was matched against Grass Wonder a colt who had been the best of his generation in 1997 but missed most of the 1998 season before returning to win the Arima Kinen in December. Special Week was beaten three lengths into second place by Grass Wonder but finished seven lengths clear of the other ten runners. On his return to racing in autumn, Special Week finished seventh behind Tsurumaru Tsuyoshi in the Kyoto Daishoten on 10 October. In the Tenno Sho over 2000 metres at Tokyo on 31 October, Special Week attempted to become the second horse to win both the spring and autumn editions of the race in the same year. The race attracted a seventeen-runner field including Mejiro Bright, Silent Hunter, Tsurumaru Tsuyoshi, King Halo, Seiun Sky, Stay Gold, Stinger (Hanshin Juvenile Fillies) and Air Jihad (Yasuda Kinen). In a closely contested conclusion to the race, Special Week prevailed by a neck from Stay Gold, with Air Jihad, Stinger, Seiun Sky and the outsider Embrasser Moi all finishing within two lengths for the winner. The winning time of 1:58.0 was a new record for the race. On 28 November, in front of a crowd of 155,000, Special Week made his second attempt to defeat international competition in the Japan Cup. The Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Montjeu started favourite with Special Week the joint-second choice alongside the German horse Tiger Hill, twice winner of the Grosser Preis von Baden. The other European challengers were High-Rise, Borgia and Fruits of Love (Hardwicke Stakes) whilst Hong Kong was represented by their Horse of the Year Indigenous. The best fancied of the other Japanese runners were Rascal Suzuka (third in the Kikuka Sho), Stay Gold and Umeno Fiber (Yushun Himba). Special Week was restrained by Take in the early stages before turning into the straight in sixth place. He took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and won by one and a half lengths and a nose from Indigenous and High-Rise, with Montjeu in fourth. Yutaka Take, who was winning the race for the first time said, \\"I am very pleased because I could achieve one of my dreams... I am proud to be Japanese.\\" Special Week ended his racing career when he met Grass Wonder for the second time in the Arima Kinen at Nakayma in December. The race produced a four-way photo finish in which Special Week was beaten a nose by Grass Wonder, with T M Opera O and Tsurumaru Tsuyoshi just behind. For his efforts over the course of the season, Special Week was given a special award at the JRA Awards for 1999. Stud record Special Week was retired from racing to stand at the Shadai Stallion Station in Hokkaido. He later moved to the Lex Stud where he was based in 2015. He died from injuries sustained when he fell in his paddock in April 2018. The most successful of his offspring was the mare Buena Vista who won six Grade I races including the Tenno Sho and the Japan Cup, Roman Legend (Tokyo Daishoten), Cesario (Yushun Himba, American Oaks) and Toho Jackal (Kikuka Sho). Popular culture Special Week was the inspiration for the main character of the 2018 anime Uma Musume Pretty Derby, which premiered shortly before his death.

He lives and works in Helsinki, Finland. Early life and education Marko Vuokola was born in Toijala, Finland as the youngest son of photographer Aimo Vuokola and Tuula Vuokola. He studied at the Department of Sculpture at the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki from 1987 and received a BA in 1991, followed by studies in Media Arts at AKI, De Academie voor Kunst en Industrie in Enschede, the Netherlands 1991-92. He graduated with an MA from the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts in 2001.Marko Vuokola. Edited by M√§rit Aronsson. Trondheim Kunstmuseum, Trondheim 2012.Marko Vuokola. The Seventh Wave. Galerie Anhava, Helsinki 2008. Work Vuokola works across a wide variety of media and materials, departing often from a conceptual exploration of issues relating to time and space. Many works, particularly in his collaborations in the OLO collective (together with Pasi Eerik Karjula), have a strongly installational and site-related character. Despite his training as a sculptor, much of his artistic oeuvre is based on photography, video or computer animation. He is often mentioned as a photographer, although it is more proper to describe his work as based on ideas just as much as on materials. His works often also explore the optical and other aspects of his artistic media, like the camera or the video projector.Pontus Kyander, ‚ÄùShift. Marko Vuokola‚Äù in Marko Vuokola. The Seventh Wave. Galerie Anhava, Helsinki 2008, pp 10-17. Gold Thread, 1995 During the summer of 1995, Vuokola spent five weeks in remote Palsinoja in the Finnish Lapland digging for gold. The 4 grams of gold that he collected were stretched into a thin thread only 0,12 mm thick and approximately 7 m long. The work deals with time just as much as with the precious material, and also with the concepts of sculpture and visuality in art. The thread can hardly be seen when stretched across a wall, while it represents a considerable amount of physical work. The work was exhibited at Henry Moore institute, Leeds, in 1996 and later acquired by Kiasma, the Finnish national museum of contemporary art. The Seventh Wave, 2001-  In 2001 Vuokola started up the series of works that he is most known for, The Seventh Wave. In these photographic diptychs, each panel depicts what might seem an identical motive. The difference between the images can be described in terms of time, as an unknown amount of time has passed between the two exposures. The difference is also a matter of space and material, as the physical and light circumstances have changed, even if these differences might be very small. The camera remains in the same position during these exposures. Many of these works have been shot outdoors, but this does not mean it is a series of landscape images, as several interiors and even seemingly abstract motives are included in the series.Hanna Johansson, ‚ÄùOn the Themes and Motives of the Seventh Wave Series by Marko Vuokola‚Äù in Marko Vuokola. The Seventh Wave. Galerie Anhava, Helsinki 2008, pp 3-7. The Seventh Wave includes landscapes from Finland, park views from the Versailles of Louis XIV, the surroundings of Donald Judd‚Äôs Marfa in Texas, interiors and exteriors from Hong Kong, Great Barrier Island in New Zealand, seascapes from Vietnam, a car vendor‚Äôs display room and the artist‚Äôs home and neighbourhood. The title of the series comes from the popular belief, that on sea, the seventh wave tends to be the largest. RGB Series, 1996-  Starting as an experiment with a projector displaying a video of the projector itself ‚Äì very much in the spirit of Nam June Paik‚Äôs work ‚Äì RGB-light (1996) became just as much a study of how projected light behaves when interacting with visitors. The projection itself is in black and white, but the light cast on the wall of the exhibition space is prismatically split into a variety of colours, depending on how the three additive primary colours (red, green and blue) of the RGB projector are affected by the movement of visitors in the space. A continued experimentation with the possibilities within these aspects of optics has resulted also in the prints RGB (1996-2012) and the computer animation RGB-information (2005). The Anatomy of Images, 2012-  Originating in experiments with images of streaming water (Tammerkoski, 2012), Vuokola started exploring the very fundaments of digital photography. In Flora (sharpen), a large diptych of a Norwegian waterfall from the same year, a small selection of pixels from the center of each of the two digital files were enlarged to form a new diptych of their own. The connection in this case to landscape imagery is essential, as the work approaches the basics of the construction of visuality as well as digital images.Jyrki Siukonen, ‚ÄùChasing Falling Water‚Äù in Marko Vuokola. Edited by M√§rit Aronsson. Trondheim Kunstmuseum, Trondheim 2012. Collaborations Together with artist colleague Pasi Eerik Karjula Vuokola has formed the collective OLO since 1990. OLO is primarily working with site-engaged installations and commissions. The collaboration has resulted in over 50 works, most of them outside of Finland. The best known of these is the extensive public art work for Hietalahti Square in Helsinki (OLO No. 22, 2000). Another long term collaboration although less formalised is the collective Forest Camp, which was formed in 1998. Forest Camp functions as a think tank for immaterial work and temporary public interventions. Exhibitions Vuokola‚Äôs solo exhibitions include a major presentation at SKMU S√∏rlandets kunstmuseum in Norway in 2011, followed by a large intervention with his works installed together with the collection of Trondheim Kunstmuseum in 2012-13, for which a book was published documenting the installations. He has shown extensively with Galerie Anhava in Helsinki since 1992. He was in 1994 the youngest artist to be presented with a solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Ateneum, the Finnish National Gallery in Helsinki.Marko Vuokola.

Because the number 3 and the letter 'B' are of particular significance to freemasonry, music written in the keys of C minor or E flat major, which both involve 3 flats, (whose symbol '‚ô≠' resembles the lowercase letter 'b'), in their key signatures has been considered especially appropriate for masonic ceremonial music.Sichrovsky (2009) The music written for masonic use by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is among the best-known of its kind. It includes the Maurerische Trauermusik (Masonic Funeral Music) and a number of songs and cantatas.Abert (2007), 780‚Äì782 Mozart's opera The Magic Flute and his incidental music to Thamos, King of Egypt also have masonic connections.Hill (1980), 754 Lodges sometimes used the music of other composers for their proceedings (with or without permission) often adding different words. For example, in 1810, Ludwig van Beethoven, who is not documented as a mason, wrote to his friend the doctor Franz Wegeler: \\"I was told you were singing a song of mine in the Masonic Lodge... Send it to me, I am going to replace it and you won't be sorry.\\" Wegeler himself published two masonic texts suggesting melodies of Beethoven (the Opferlied WoO 126 and the song Der freie Mann WoO 117) which could be used for them.Nettl (1994), 63 Music especially composed for masonic rituals began to be published in the 18th century, including music written by Georg Benda, Ignaz Pleyel, Fran√ßois-Andr√© Danican Philidor, Johann Gottlieb Naumann and Christian Gottlob Neefe. Anthems and other works for use in masonic lodges were written by, amongst others, in the 18th century William Boyce, in the 19th century Albert Lortzing, and in the 20th century Jean Sibelius.Hill (1980), 754‚Äì755 See also *Mozart and Freemasonry *:Composers of masonic music References Notes Sources *Abert, Herman, tr.Stewart Spencer (2007).

The players are in charge of defending their planet from an alien invasion. The game supports two players at once, splitting the screen vertically into two halves, and merging them on the fly when both players are in the same location. Gameplay Even in early stages, the screen quickly fills with enemies. The large blue diamond is a seed crystal. The pile of blue blocks below it is a crystal that has reached the ground and mutated into a colonizer. The game shares elements of Potter's first Atari game, Protector, itself based graphically on the arcade game, Defender. Like Defender, the action is primarily side-scrolling on a map that wraps around to allow continual travel to the left or right. Shadow World adds a limited amount of vertical scrolling motion as well. Compared to Protector, Shadow World has much more action with significant numbers of moving objects. The game also shares elements with his earlier game Nautilus, notably the way the planet is laid out onscreen and the way the player has to destroy certain enemies by shooting their core. In Shadow World, the players are in charge of defending the planet of Jantor, which is under attack by the alien Rigillians who are attempting to steal the planet's supply of tricasmium, an element with unique multi-dimensional properties that are used as the basis of all modern technology. The Rigillians have launched \\"seed crystals\\" towards the planet from space, which emit small defensive drones as they fall towards the ground. The crystal can be destroyed by shooting through its outer shell to reach its inner core, but it periodically repairs its shell to counter these attacks. If the crystal touches the ground it mutates into a \\"colonizer\\" which cannot be destroyed by shooting it. These colonizers constantly emit seeker drones, acting as a defensive station protecting new seed crystals that are dropped. If five seed crystals manage to land and form colonizers, the planet explodes. The seed crystals also drop a surface skimmer which begins to collect the tricasmium nuggets found on the surface. The skimmer can be destroyed to save the supply of nuggets, which can be picked up and dropped on the colonizers to destroy them. The player's fighters, shaped either like the fighter from Protector (and thus Defender) or the helicopter from Fort Apocalypse, are armed with a gun firing to the left and right, as well as three smart bombs that destroy all the drones that are on the screen at the time it's activated. Using the smart bomb also returns the player to their base, which prevents it from being used immediately prior to attacking a crystal. The area around the base is protected by shields that prevent any Rigillians from entering the area above it. Development Shadow World was the last in a series of games Potter wrote for Synapse in a one-year period between November 1981. All made use of smooth scrolling and demonstrated an evolution in technique, growing more graphically complex over time, and becoming much faster paced. Potter's royalties were shrinking over time, eventually reaching 80 cents a game sold. At the same time copyright infringement was rampant. When he saw that his own brother in law had made unlicensed copies of all his games, he decided to leave the games market. He turned to the nascent IBM PC market, but also released a few more Atari titles with other labels. Reception Antic commented only on its frenetic pace, noting \\"After playing this game, you may never complain about rush-hour traffic again.\\" Potter rated it as his favorite game.

Facts=Cavendish Square Holding BV v Makdessi In Makdessi because the issue of penalty clauses had been taken as a preliminary issue, the appeal was heard on the basis of an agreed set of facts (the court having not yet heard evidence or made any determinations). The agreed facts were summarised in the judgment of Lord Mance: It was accepted by Mr El Makdessi for the purposes of the case that he did subsequently breach clause 11.2, and was thereby also in breach of his fiduciary duties. The proceedings were initiated by both Cavendish and the main holding company. The holding company's claim (for breach of fiduciary duty) was settled in October 2012 when it accepted a Part 36 payment of US$500,000 made by Mr El Makdessi. Cavendish's claim was for declarations that Mr El Makdessi's breach of clause 11.2 means that clauses 5.1 and 5.6 now have the effect stated. Mr El Makdessi argued that they were unenforceable penalty clauses. ParkingEye Limited v Beavis In ParkingEye, the appellant, Mr Beavis, was the owner and driver of a vehicle which he parked in a retail shopping car park adjacent to Chelmsford railway station. The owner of the retail site and car park, British Airways Pension Fund (BAPF), had contracted ParkingEye Ltd, the respondent, to provide \\"a traffic space maximisation scheme\\". The scheme involved the erection at the entrance to and throughout the car park of prominent notices, including the statements \\"2 hour max stay\\" and \\"Parking limited to 2 hours\\", coupled with the further notice \\"Failure to comply ... will result in a Parking Charge of ¬£85\\". Underneath, it also stated: \\"By parking within the car park, motorists agree to comply with the car park regulations\\". Mr Beavis left his car parked for 56 minutes over the permitted two-hour period. He argued that the ¬£85 charge demanded of him by ParkingEye (reducible to ¬£50 if he had paid within 14 days) was an unenforceable penalty. Further or alternatively, he maintained that it is unfair and invalid within the meaning of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. Judgment The Supreme Court held by a majority (Lord Toulson dissenting in the ParkingEye case) that the provisions in the Cavendish case were not penalties, and in ParkingEye that the charge was not an unlawful penalty or contrary to the 1999 Regulations or the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive. Lord Sumption and Lord Neuberger gave the first opinion jointly. Lord Mance gave a concurring opinion. Lord Hodge gave a concurring opinion, noting that he was \\"initially in some doubt\\" about the ParkingEye case. Lord Clarke concurred with Lord Sumption, Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance and Lord Hodge. Lord Toulson dissented, and would have held that the ¬£85 charge was unlawful. Significance Commentators on the decision have noted that \\"these cases provide some welcome clarification to the law in this area\\", and that going forward \\"it seems that where parties have negotiated a contract, on a level playing field and with the assistance of professional advisors, it will now be much harder for the party paying liquidated damages to challenge the validity of those provisions on the basis that they are a penalty.\\" Others have suggested that \\"in deciding to abandon the admittedly over-rigid categorisation of penalty clauses in Dunlop the Supreme Court has, in the course of explaining and updating the law in this fascinating decision, created some uncertainty in the commercial world.\\" Other impacts on equitable relief In Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding, the House of Lords had held that the equitable remedy of relief from forfeiture was not \\"confined to any particular type of case\\". The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council subsequently affirmed that principle in Cukurova Finance International Ltd v Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd, declaring \\"that relief from forfeiture is available in principle where what is in question is forfeiture of proprietary or possessory rights, as opposed to merely contractual rights, regardless of the type of property concerned\\". In Cavendish, the Supreme Court has extended relief to contractual provisions, such as forfeiture clauses, as noted by Lord Hodge: This can be construed to hold that relief is available to circumvent the effect of time bar provisions that exist in some contracts, which can contain onerous notice provisions.

Jharkhand was a ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù for Naxalites to experiment with their ideas of establishing a parallel government. As of 2005, 16 of the 22 districts in the state, including Hazaribagh district, was transformed into a ‚Äúguerrilla zone‚Äù. The movement was not restricted to armed operations but included kangaroo courts called Jan Adalats, elected village bodies and people's police. Jharkhand, with a dense forest cover over a large part of the state, offers a favourable terrain for the Naxalites to build their bases and operate. Annual fatalities in Jharkhand were 117 in 2003 and 150 in 2004. In 2013 Jharkhand was considered one of the two states in the country most affected by Left wing extremism and Jharkhand police set up an exclusive cell to deal with Maoist activities. However, in the same year, when Jharkhand police identified 13 focus areas for combating Maoist extremism, Hazaribagh district was not one of them. Geography Barkagaon is located at .

She contributed to several popular Sunday school hymnbooks, and wrote the lyrics to a number of well-known hymns including: \\"I Need Thee Every Hour\\"; \\"Thine, Most Gracious Lord\\"; \\"Why Weepest Thou? Who Seekest Thou?\\"; \\"Full and Free Salvation\\" and \\"My Soul Is Anchored\\".Annie S Hawks on Hymnary.org, accessed 5 November 2015 Early life and education Annie Sherwood was born on May 28, 1836, in Hoosick, New York. Her ancestry on her father's side was English, and on her mother's side, remotely, Holland Dutch. She was educated in the public schools and in the Troy Seminary. She was never graduated from any school, but she always had a passion for books and read widely. By age 14, she was submitting poems to a local newspaper.Smith, Jane Stuart and Betty Carlson. Great Christian Hymn Writers. Wheaton, Illinois: Crossway Books, 1997: 85. Career The first poem which she published appeared in a Troy, New York, newspaper. That poem at once attracted attention and was followed by others which were printed in various local papers. She married Charles Hial Hawks in 1857 or 1859, a member of a New York banking firm, and a resident of Hoosick. In January, 1865, the Hawks removed to Brooklyn. They attended the Hanson Place Baptist Church where Lowry was pastor. Lowry, himself a hymn-writer, encouraged Hawks to compose her own hymns. In 1868, her pastor and friend, Rev. Dr. Robert Lowry, requested her to turn her attention to hymn writing, and her first hymns were written in that year. Among others, these included, \\"In the Valley\\", \\"Good Night\\", \\"Why Weepest Thou?\\", ‚ÄúWho'll Be the Next to Follow Jesus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIn the Valley.‚Äù Lowry set all of Hawks' hymns to music. Though Hawks was chiefly known as a writer of hymns, she also wrote many poems. \\"I Need Thee Every Hour\\" \\"I Need Thee Every Hour\\" In 1872, the hymn by which Hawks is most widely known, \\"I Need Thee Every Hour\\", was written. It is said to have been translated into more foreign languages than any other modern hymn at the time of her death. Hawks stated:‚Äî \\"For myself, the hymn was prophetic rather than expressive of my own experiences, for it was wafted out to the world on the wings of love and joy, instead of under the stress of personal sorrow.\\" Lowry, who wrote the music, went on to say: \\"I Need Thee Every Hour\\" was written by Mrs. Annie S. Hawks, in 1872, in Brooklyn, New York. I believe it was the expression of her own experience. It came to me in the form of five simple stanzas, to which I added the chorus to make it more serviceable. It inspired me at its first reading. It first appeared in a small collection of original songs prepared for the National Baptist Sunday-school Association, held in Cincinnati, Ohio in November, 1872, and was sung on that occasion.\\" Personal life Annie Hawks Hawks was the mother of three children. She identified with the Baptist denomination. After the death of her husband in 1888, she moved to Bennington, Vermont to live with her daughter and son-in-law.

The law reformed the practice of de-Baathification, extending de-Baathification to the judiciary, while reinstating jobs and pensions to low-ranking members of the ousted Baath Party. The De-Ba'athification Council was made permanent though renamed to Accountability and Justice Commission and reformed in scope and policy. The law was passed by the Council of Representatives on 12 January 2008, with only 140 out of 275 members being present. After Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi refused to sign, the controversial law was passed by a majority vote by the Presidency Council.  Details  The law defines de-Baathification as \\"The procedures‚Ä¶ to intellectually, administratively, politically, culturally and economically dismantle the Ba‚Äôath Party system in Iraqi society, state institutions, and civil society institutions.\\" The Ba'ath Party is recognized as the party \\"which took power on 17/07/1968 and [was] prohibited by article (7) of the Iraqi constitution.\\" A member of the Ba'ath Party, subject to the penalties of the law is defined as, \\"any individual who joined the Ba'ath Party and gave an oath of allegiance to it.\\" Collaborators are defined as any individual who worked with or benefited from the Ba'ath Party. The next sections of the law detail the composition and qualifications of the members of the Commission, and the purposes of the Commission. The stated goal of the Commission is similar to the Coalition Provisional Authority's (CPA) goal of eliminating any and all traces of Ba'ath Party ideology, in any manifestation, from the political, social, and economic life of Iraq. Additionally, the Commission has the duty of compiling the names and information about members to be maintained in archives that document the Ba'athist period in Iraqi history. Iraqis allowed to return to work in the government are those who held low level positions in the Ba'ath Party are allowed to return to work in some public sector jobs. However, several key positions and ministries are still barred from these individuals. Additionally, anyone who profited from being a member of the Ba'ath Party, is barred from additional posts in the public sector. There is also the possibility that certain individuals will be eligible for pensions, and the law also creates an appeals process for those deemed subject to its penalties. Finally, the end of the law provides the Commission‚Äôs composition, and the justifications for the law. According to the International Centre for Transitional Justice, the new Justice and Accountability Act is not exactly the reconciliatory reform envisioned. It maintains most of the structures of the Higher National De-Ba'athification Council (or Independent Iraqi De-Ba'athification Council), and in some cases expands the power of the council to previously immune ministries. However, the ability for some previously excluded Iraqis to obtain some form of public sector work, and the extension of pensions to some Ba'ath Party members are considered positive developments by the International Centre for Transitional Justice. In reality, the law provides for some protections previously withheld from affected Iraqis while maintaining the structure of CPA Order Nos. 1 and 2, and in some cases expanding upon the powers within those Orders.  Debate and legislative procedure  The Accountability and Justice Act was passed on 12 January 2008 as the 10th law passed by the Council of Representatives in that year. However, only 140 out of 275 members were present. After Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi refused to sign, the controversial law was passed by a majority vote by the Presidency Council.Inside Iraqi politics ‚Äì Part 5. A look at legislative progress: Sunnis‚Äô and states‚Äô rights, The Long War Journal, 2008-02-28. Retrieved 2008-02-28.  Reactions  Iraqi diplomat Feisal al-Istrabadi, lead drafter of the 2004 Transitional Administrative Law, praised the law as correcting the overreach of Paul Bremer's original De- Ba'athification decrees, which \\"captured a large number of people who were innocent of any wrongdoing by any objective measure and were deprived of the ability to earn a living and support their families,\\" thereby feeding the insurgency. Furthermore, though the majority of Ba'ath members were Shia, it was the Sunnis who were disproportionately removed from offices, to the extent that the latter called it \\"de-Sunnification\\". Whether the new was a positive step toward reconciliation, depended on how the law would be applied.

A sequel entitled Junk Jack X was released on August 29, 2013. Junk Jack X has recently been renamed to Junk Jack, and the original game has been renamed to Junk Jack Retro. Gameplay Junk Jack is a 2D sandbox game where the player collects resources and aims to explore and survive in a randomly generated environment full of treasures and hidden secrets, filled with biomes on the surface and underground. Plot Like all sandbox games, the game has no clear objectives and has no concrete plot; the player creates their own storyline based on their individual experience. However, Junk Jack X contains obtainable items to travel to other worlds, an action that the game strongly recommends players do. Development The developer and coder is Jacopo Santoni (Jack), and the graphics/sfx artist is Silvio Eusebio (XsX). The pair met on multiplayer in Minecraft, and decided to collaborate on a similar game for the iPhone; at that point there were no iOS sandbox games. Critical reception=Junk Jack The game has a Metacritic rating of 85% based on 11 critic reviews. Slide to Play described the game as fun and addictive, while 148Apps deemed it a must-own for lovers of the sandbox-crafting genre. Pocket Gamer noted that it had a high learning curve, but that it was enjoyable once the player eased into it. Multiplayer.it even said it was better than Minecraft: Pocket Edition. Junk Jack X The game has a Metacritic rating of 83% based on 7 critic reviews. Touch Arcade noted that it added new features to the sandbox, and built upon its prequels success, without drastically reinventing the genre. Pocket Gamer reasoned that the game wouldn't convert non-believers to the genre. Gamezebo appreciated the extra easing-in the game does to help keep players who may have left Junk Jack due to frustration over difficulty. At April 27th, Pixbits released Junk Jack X for steam, but they have now returned the game to the original title \\"Junk Jack\\".

Description and history The Farrar House is located northwest of downtown Bangor, set on the north side of Court Street just east of Coe Park, overlooking Kenduskeag Stream. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, with a front-facing gable roof, brick walls, and a granite foundation. Its street-facing facade has a massive and elaborate Greek temple treatment, with four two-story fluted Doric columns supporting an ornately carved entablature and fully pedimented gable with a triangular carved panel at its center. The front wall behind the colonnade has three bays articulated by brick pilasters, with the entrance in the center bay. The rear (stream-facing) facade originally had a similar temple front. To the left of the main block stands a recessed brick addition, with stylistically similar elements. An enclosed porch stands at the corner joining the two parts. A modern hyphen joins the building at its rear to a modern two-story flat-roofed apartment complex. The house was built in 1836 for Samuel Farrar, who was for many years one of Bangor's leading lumbermen, also working as a banker and municipal judge. The house is an early design of Richard Upjohn, and is one of three prominent Greek Revival buildings he designed in Bangor. The addition on the left side of the house, made in 1846, was designed by Isaiah Rogers.

A large number of Rhododendrons collected by Cooper continue to grow in the Gardens.  Life  He was born at Kingston-on-Thames in 1890, and was apparently orphaned aged only four and later raised by his aunt Emma. Her husband, William Wright Smith, later became Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, creating Roland's link to his future role. In 1907 he travelled to India with his uncle to study and collect samples in Sikkim, Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan until 1910. This was aided by the local collector and plant expert, Rohmoo Lapcha. He then came to Edinburgh to undertake a Horticulture course at the Royal Botanic Garden. In 1913 he returned to India (without his uncle) and travelled more widely in search of species, beginning in the Himalayas. He again explored Sikkim and in 1914‚Äì15 returned to Bhutan, before exploring the Punjab in 1916. In the second half of the First World War, he served as an officer with the 1st Gurkha Rifles in north-west India. He was later attached to the Royal Flying Corps and stationed at Alexandria, Egypt in 1918‚Äì19. Staying mentally attached to the Indian subcontinent, he took on the role of Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens at Maymo in the Shan Hills of Burma in 1921. Now married and with a young family, he returned to Britain in the late 1920s for the sake of his children's education. In 1930 he returned to Edinburgh as Assistant Curator of the Royal Botanic Gardens. In 1934, he became full Curator (Head Keeper) of the Gardens. During the early 1930s, he was also responsible for laying out the grounds of Astley Ainslie Hospital. During his curatorship he lived in the East Gate Lodge with his wife, Emily. During this period (1930‚Äì54) fellow botanist John Macqueen Cowan worked alongside Cooper. In 1942 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Scotland. His proposers included his uncle, by this time Sir William Wright Smith, Thomas Rowatt and Ernest Shearer. He retired in 1950 and moved with his wife, Emily, to Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex.

Entering into force on 16 May 2003, it describes the objectives of the de-Ba'athification policy developed by the US Office of Special Plans.  Details  The Order is justified in the preamble lines: : Recognizing that the Iraqi people have suffered large scale human rights abuses and depravations over many years at the hands of the Ba'ath Party, : Noting the grave concern of Iraqi society regarding the threat posed by the continuation of Ba'ath Party networks and personnel in the administration of Iraq, and the intimidation of the people of Iraq by Ba'ath Party officials, : Concerned by the continuing threat to the security of the Coalition Forces posed by the Iraqi Ba'ath Party, Specifically, the order states that all members of the Ba'ath Party, from senior leadership to ‚ÄòUdw (Member) are \\"removed from their positions and banned from future employment in the public sector.\\" The order demonstrates its broad sweep of society by stating: : Individuals holding positions in the top three layers of management in every national government ministry, affiliated corporations and other government institutions (e.g., universities and hospitals) shall be interviewed for possible affiliation with the Ba'ath Party, and subject to investigation for criminal conduct and risk to security. The broad language of the order ensured that the broad approach favored by the Department of Defense would be the actual policy implemented under the CPA and delegated bodies. As a balance to the severity of the policy, the final clause of the Order states that the Administrator Paul Bremer can grant exceptions to the policy laid out in the Order. Order No. 1 Memorandum Entering into force on 3 June 2003, the Memorandum entitled \\"Implementation of De-Ba'athification Order No. 1\\" describes the process by which the objectives described in Order No. 1 and Order No. 5 are to be carried out. The memo envisions a two phase process by which the policy is carried out. Initially, the Multi-National Force ‚Äì Iraq (\\"Coalition Forces\\"), being the most capable institution in Iraq, were charged with ferreting out Ba'athists, and convening Accreditation Review Committees in order to fully investigate and vet possible party members. The second phase was contingent on the first phase‚Äôs success. In the second phase, enough Iraqi members of government have been deemed to not be affiliated with the Ba'ath Party and the Iraqi government is competent enough, the implementation of de- Ba'athification will go from being solely a CPA and Coalition Forces duty to the duty of the Iraqi government and the Iraqi De-Ba'athification Council, established by Order No. 5. Section two of the memo describes the process of determining if individuals have party affiliations. The memo provides for investigators to be placed within government ministries to conduct investigations into individuals using: : i. Interviews with the individual (conducted by the investigators using the standardized form already developed); : ii. Public records and announcements documenting the ascension or promotion of party members; : iii. Judgments of CPA senior ministry advisors [sic]; : iv. Testimony of Iraqis who have worked with the person in question; : v. Findings of the Iraqi de-Ba'athification Council described below (passed to the investigators through the Administrator); : vi. Assessment of leading Iraqi political figures; and : vii. Government records revealing bonuses or other privileges associated with being a party member. Once the investigator determined an individual‚Äôs affiliation and deemed them subject to Order No. 1, they were to be informed of their right to appeal. If an exception was requested, then the investigator was to determine the eligibility of the individual and prepare a case if necessary. The overall goal of the memorandum was to provide a structure for determining Ba'ath Party membership. Additionally, Iraqis were encouraged to be part of the de- Ba'athification process, and Coalition Forces initially charged with the policy were encouraged to consult with Iraqis. If an individual received an appeals hearing, he or she could avoid the punishments under Order No. 1 by proving the following: : i. Is willing to denounce the Ba'ath Party and his past association with it; : ii. Was a senior Ba'ath Party member or simply a ‚Äòfull‚Äô party member; : iii. Has exceptional education qualifications; : iv. Left the Ba'ath Party before 16 April 2003 [the date the CPA officially dissolved the Ba'ath Party]; : v. Continues to command the support of his colleagues and respect of their subordinates; : vi. Is judged to be indispensable to achieving important Coalition interests, at least in the immediate term; : vii. Can demonstrate that he joined the party to hold his job or support his family. Such information was supposed to be considered in an individual‚Äôs appeal, but did not guarantee an exception, and the Administrator possessed the authority to overturn any ruling handed down by the Accreditation Review Committees.Coalition Provisional Authority Memorandum Number 1.

In 2008 the railroad began considering the possibility of resuming commercial passenger service along the entire line from the Danbury Branch to Pittsfield, and in May 2010 began a formal study of the same. At the time, the estimated cost of upgrading the railroad to support passenger trains was estimated to be between $100 million and $150 million, not including the cost of the required equipment. It decided it would not renew its agreement with Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum to continue operating passenger excursions over their railroad. In July 2014, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) authorized the purchase of 37 miles of the railroad's Berkshire Line from the Connecticut border in Sheffield through Great Barrington, Stockbridge, Lee, and Lenox to Pittsfield, where it joins the CSXT Railroad main line. MassDOT's purchase is intended to extend rail services to New York City via Southeast Station, following track improvements for passenger and freight service between Massachusetts and Connecticut.

His father was a printer and his mother ran a stationery shop. Frans would have five siblings: two brothers and three sisters. His oldest brother Lodewijk became a renowned composer.

He then continued his studies at the Higher Institute of Fine Arts of Antwerp, the recently established institute for post-graduate studies of the Academy. Here he studied under Albrecht De Vriendt as well as Frans Van Leemputten. Frans Mortelmans led a very bourgeois existence. In 1897 he married Marie Fontain. The couple remained childless. His principal income was derived from his job as a teacher at the Municipal Academy of Berchem. In the final years of his career until his retirement in 1835 he was the caretaking director of that Academy as a replacement of the director in office who had suffered a stroke. Two of his most famous students at the Academy were Joris Minne and Antoon Mastboom. Mortelmans also gave private lessons to Countess Romania du Bois d'Aische, the sister-in-law of Fritz Mayer van den Bergh, whose art collection was the basis of the collection of the Museum Mayer van den Bergh.

They were founded in the beginning of the 20th century and currently operate in an officially recognized way in more than 154 countries, with a presence in 168 countries. The goal of the GBU is to discuss Biblical texts and to make the Bible known in the academic world. Though they have a clear evangelical Christian orientation, those groups are non-denominational and are open to all students.\\"Article 10 : Caract√®re non eccl√©sial de l'association\\", Statuts de l'Association des Groupes Bibliques universitaires de France, 2006 (in French) The French and Swiss GBU are founding members of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (Union Internationale des Groupes Bibliques Universitaires), a network of like-minded campus organizations around the world.  Origins of the GBU = Forerunners  In the 17th century in Scotland, groups of students began to meet on their own initiative in order to study the Bible and pray together. Similar groups were reported in England and then in the United States of America in the 18th century under a variety of names. The goal of those ‚Äúsocieties‚Äù was mainly to grow in faith through prayer, exhortation and the discussion of theological subjects. They were often kept secret to avoid the suspicion of excessive spiritualism. At the same time in continental Europe, German pietism and its extensions had a huge impact among students with an emphasis on witnessing and evangelism. This concern grew in several groups in America in the beginning of the 19th century. It resulted in remarkable missionary commitments within the large missionary societies which had been created over the previous century. A need was felt to establish relationships between universities. It was also the time of the great awakenings which occurred in many European countries, paving the way for more interdenominational cooperation and alliances. During the second half of the 19th century, several evangelical youth organisations developed worldwide with significant ramifications among students (e.g. Young Men‚Äôs and Young women‚Äôs Christian Associations). Following its predecessors, the emphasis on global mission increased considerably (e.g. Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions).  The first GBU  The foundation of the organization has been traced back to 1877 with the creation in Cambridge University of the CICCU (Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union). Several factors had prepared the ground: a strong evangelical presence in the University for a century, a Missionary Union that had been encouraged by David Livingstone and prayer meetings that had been held on a daily basis for several years. In 1873, groups in London hospitals founded the Medical Prayer Union. With the Christian Union in Oxford, which had been founded in 1881, all those groups created the SCM (Student Christian Movement of Great BritainStudent Christian Movement). Similar movements developed in other countries, especially in the English-speaking world. They joined together into a world evangelical and missionary federation : the WSCF (World Student Christian Federation). An heir of 19th century rationalism, theological liberalism or modernism exerted growing influence over many churches and thus over Christian organisations. Little by little, the line of the founders was set aside, with its emphasis on the primacy of the Gospel and on the authority of the Scriptures. The SCM‚Äôs responsiveness to the new ideas resulted in serious differences of views. In 1910, the CICCU was therefore sidelined because it wanted to remain faithful to the biblical foundations. From then on, the two movements developed independently. After the shock of the First World War, the activities of CICCU and similar groups resumed. The movement expanded progressively to a great number of universities in Great Britain. In places, some common ground could be found with the WSCF, but the split was complete a few years later due to serious ideological drift. At the international level, some GBU are involved in humanitarian actions.  The GBU in France = Organization  In France, the GBU are also called AGBUF (Association des Groupes Bibliques Universitaires de France), constituted in accordance with the French law of 1901 concerning non-profit organisations. They bring together students who are eager to study the Bible. They provide them with the opportunity to meet at or around universities and to deepen their knowledge together with other students. Local groups are run autonomously. The GBU is a student organisation. All its student activities are under the responsibility of the Student Executive Committee which reports to a supervisory board, the National Council. The main activity is reading the Bible together. Meetings are open to all and everyone is free to share their beliefs concerning the Scriptures. At the international level, the French GBU are a founding member of IFES (International Fellowship of Evangelical Students).  History  In 1942, during the German occupation of France, some students began to meet in Aix-en-Provence in order to pray and study the Bible together. They were encouraged by M. Ren√© Pache, the founder of the Swiss GBU in 1932 and vice-president of IFES in 1947, who was the speaker at the first GBU camp in Anduze in 1943. Immediately afterwards, groups of university and high school students were formed in Marseilles, Montpellier, Nimes and Al√®s, and a year or two later in Grenoble, Lyon, Paris and Bordeaux. The ‚ÄúUnion des GBU de France‚Äù was officially established in 1950. The events of 1968 sent shock waves that tremendously affected university life and reverberated within the GBU. The following decade was one of unprecedented development. Groups multiplied, more students were committed and became members of the GBU, large Easter congresses were organised, more people were contacted In 1976, the PBU (Presses Bibliques Universitaires) were established jointly with the Swiss and Belgian GBUs. Books were published on issues such as culture, ideologies, nuclear power, poetry, etc. Around 1,000 students currently gather weekly in over 90 groups in France. In Swiss Romande, around 600 students meet every week in about 50 groups.  Supporters  When they have finished their studies, students are invited to remain members of AGBUF in order to ensure the continuity of the movement and its development. The Friends of the GBU used to be organised in a separate organisation. The AGBUF is now made both of students who take an active role in local groups and of post-graduates. The latter are willing to help maintain and develop the movement they entered during their studies. These post-graduates and friends are invited to create local support groups in order to help to develop local GBU groups.

Always loyal to the British Crown, the men were unpaid volunteers whose wish was to defend the Island of Guernsey from foreign invaders. Militias were also created in the Bailiwick islands of Alderney and Sark as well as in Jersey. The commander of all military forces in Guernsey has always been appointed by the Crown, originally Wardens or Keepers, sometimes using the title Captain or Governor. Later becoming known as the Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey. History=Early history Records indicate that Guernsey had formed an armed body to defend the Island over 800 years ago, in accordance with the order on 24 July 1203 of King John to provide a sufficiency of men and money to defend the Island from the enemy. In 1214 Eustace the Monk, a pirate, based in Sark arrived under orders from the King of France to harry the Channel Islands. In Guernsey he met a newly raised and locally armed defence force comprising the whole manhood of the Island. This could be considered to be the first Island militia. A Henry III survey dated 1248 records that Islanders were free from (overseas) military service, excepting assisting the Duke of Normandy to recover England if necessary. The Island was invaded in 1294, Castle Cornet was held for several years before the French invaders were repulsed. The militia is first mentioned in 1331. A further French invasion took place in 1336 and was again repulsed. At the start of the war, that would last for over a hundred years, King Edward III of England authorised Thomas de Ferres in 1337 to ‚Äúlevy and train‚Äù militias in the Guernsey, Jersey, Sark and Alderney, to the use of arms and to aray them in thousands, hundreds and twenties. The militias of Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney and Sark can claim to date from 1337, making them the oldest regiments of the British Army.T.F. Mills What is the Oldest/Senior Regiment in the British Army? (Archive of the Regiments.org page) The Sark Militia comprised 40 men known as the Quarantaine. In 1338 the Guernsey Militia had its first recorded battle. French Admiral B√©huchet landed an invasion force on the west coast of the Island. The Militia men from St Martin's and the Forest parishes met the French at Les Hubits and won the battle. For this act, King Charles II, 300 years later granted the South Regiment of militia permission to wear blue facing on their uniforms (a privilege only granted to Royal Regiments). Winning the battle did not win the war, the French Admiral returned later in the year and took the Island, including Castle Cornet where the 65 defenders, many militia men, were all killed, as were 12 other archers at Jerbourg Point. Guernsey sailors managed to put up some resistance with two Venetian galleys being sunk, however the Island was captured. In 1340 the Island was recaptured when the French retreated into the Castle, however the French held out in Castle Cornet until August 1345 when, after a three-day attack by professional soldiers and the local militia the castle was taken and all the French were killed. The King ordered St Peter Port to be defended by walls, it is not clear whether these walls were built, but a tower at Beauregard was constructed. In 1358 the French returned and the castle taken again, with the French evicted the next year and an island traitor executed. Training was undertaken weekly in each parish, using common land, or at a specialist place near each church named Les Buttes where archery could be practiced. In 1372 Owain Lawgoch a claimant to the Welsh throne, at the head of a free company, on behalf of France, attacked Guernsey, popularly called ‚ÄúLa Descente des Aragousais‚Äù. Owain Lawgoch withdrew after killing 400 of the Island militia, when ordered by Charles V to sail to La Rochelle. A French assault in 1461, during the War of the Roses was repulsed. 1546 is the date of the first ordinance of the Royal Court. Requiring all men to obey their captains, work of defence works and provide their own weapons. The poor being provided with weapons by their parish. During the 15th and 16th Centuries the militia evolved into a parish basis, with each of the 10 parishes raising a company of around 100 men, commanded by a captain. 17th and 18th centuries By 1621 there were 1,157 men in the Militia, in 1656 there were 1,418 and by 1680 1,902. The militia men were not paid, service continuing to be compulsory because the fear of a French invasion was always present. It was possible to gain an exemption from service, but those who did were then resented by the rest of the population. Duties including attending reviews, practice and standing watch. If a militiaman was unable to attend they had to get someone else to do their duty. It was not unusual for women to do night guard duty, standing in for their men so they would be able to work the next day. There is a report that the French were put off landing on Alderney by the sight of a mass of red coats in a watch post, these being women. During the Third English Civil War the Island supported Parliament, whereas Castle Cornet supported the King. In 1651, the Island of Jersey, which was Royalist, was taken by Parliamentarian forces and Ensign Nicholas Robert from Saint Martin, Guernsey militia was with the Parliamentarian forces. Whilst there he recovered the Crown of England that had belonged to Charles I from the cupola on top of the Court House in Jersey and brought it back to Guernsey, delivering it to the Governor of Castle Cornet. It was only on 17 December 1651, after an 8-year siege, regular bombardments and half-hearted attacks, including one in March 1651 by the militia, where 30 were killed, that the castle capitulated, the last Royalist garrison to surrender. The Royal Crown was returned to London. The general muster of militia in September 1656 with the Honourable Colonel Bingham, Governor of Guernsey, and Colonel Squire records 1,418 men under arms, 340 from Town, each other parish supplying between 48 and 180 men each. 1657 is the first written mention of the Alderney Militia. On 31 May 1660 the militia provided security for Charles II when he visited the Island. The first Colonel of militia was Charles Andros (1664‚Äì1718) who appointed his two sons as Captains of the two companies in Town. At a review in 1664 1,324 soldiers paraded, not including artillery men, men without arms and elderly militiamen. Following his death the militia took over guard duties at Castle Cornet in St Peter Port. Officers provided their own arms and uniforms, poorer soldiers were supplied them. In 1730 there is a first mention of militia Regiments, (rather than Parish companies), each commanded by a Colonel. In 1755 orders were given to form two artillery companies. In 1780 the south militia regiment was split to make a fourth or \\"west\\" regiment. Seven Years War to Napoleonic Wars This was a period of heightened danger, Guernsey loophole towers being authorized in 1778 although most were built after 1781. The tower and battery at Rousse has been restored as a museum. Guernsey passed an ordinance requiring the militia men to wear uniforms in 1780, paid for by each man if they could afford it, otherwise by the parish. Jersey was invaded by French Royalist forces in 1781 following an attempted one in 1779, landing safely the French marched into Saint Helier where the situation resulted in the Battle of Jersey. The British government undertook to supply the militia with uniforms in 1782 and more regular British troops were brought to the island to garrison Fort George which was under construction. On 27 March 1783 there was a mutiny in Guernsey by 500 regular soldiers, mainly Irish soldiers in the recently created 104th Regiment, at winter quarters in Fort George, caused possibly by some discharged men from the recently disbanded 83rd Regiment who had just been sent to join the 104th on the island. The soldiers demanded that the fort gates be left open so they could come and go as they pleased, whilst this was agreed, the soldiers inside the fort a few days later, fired at their officers whilst at dinner in the mess, forcing them to withdraw from the fort. Both the 18th Regiment (the Royal Irish) and the Guernsey Militia turned out with 6 pieces of artillery. Volleys of shots were fired by the rebels, but when the militia outflanking the rebels, they surrendered. The rebels had, during their period in charge, continued to mount guards and undertake the normal routine of the fort despite the lack of officers. The Government of Guernsey gave a public thanks to the 18th Regiment and militiamen, awarding them 100 guineas. Two men were wounded, 36 ringleaders arrested and the 104th Regiment was disbanded. Two cannon on a militia battery, overlooking L'Eree Bay, Guernsey The militia was upgraded, four regiments, East (or Town) regiment with white facings, \\"Le Regiment Vert\\" was in the North, \\"Le Regiment Bleu\\" in the South and \\"Le Regiment Noir\\" in the West. There was also a field artillery regiment. There were objections to the men providing their own uniforms, to get over the appeal made to the Privy Council, the King agreed to pay for new red uniforms. The States agreed to pay a pension to any militiaman wounded or killed. In 1795 one soldier on sentry duty at Hougue √† la Pierre battery, Belle Grave Bay, was caught insisting civilians provide him with the military password or pay a fee if they wanted to pass by. British officers were appointed to command the militia from 1799. The militia being considered as the first line of defence against the expected French invasion and were constantly exercising and called out for guard and watch duties. A prize of ¬£25 was offered to the first person to give warning of the approach of a French fleet. Defences were strengthened, over 60 gun emplacements and ammunition magazines were built to defend possible landing beaches, manned by the militia artillery regiment. Three Martello Towers were built in 1804. The Fort Grey martello tower has been restored as a museum. Guernsey in the early 19th-century had a population of just over 10,000, and militia troops now totalled 3,158 with an additional 450 marching boys. They were designated Light Regiments. Rifle companies were added to the establishment. The Island receiving praise for the way the militia carried out their duties. Militiamen were exempt from being pressed into the Navy. Guernsey often had a regular army regiment based in the Island, and because of the British rule that foreign troops were not allowed on mainland Britain, the troops billeted in Guernsey were often foreigners, Russians, Dutch, Brunswick and French royalists. There are graves of Russian soldiers at the Vale Castle. With the draining of the Braye du Valle by 1808, new military roads were built, the \\"Route Militaire\\" along the Braye du Valle to the Vale Church, with other roads improved to military standard, from St Peter Port to Fort Hommet and from St Peter Port via St. Martin to the Forest where it split with one branch going to Torteval, the other to Fort Grey. 19th century In 1825 the light companies were converted to rifle companies and dressed in green. In January 1831 William IV, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Jersey, granted the use of the title ‚ÄúRoyal‚Äù making the name Royal Guernsey Militia and the facings on all uniforms changed to blue. The dragoons were disbanded in 1835. In 1842 the Lieutenant Governor changed to General Napier. He caused quite an upset in the Island, being rude to the Bailiff and ignoring the Courts and Laws of the Island. An incident occurred in 1845 whereby a Captain of Militia was reduced to the ranks without an explanation resulted in two Lieutenant Colonels and five other Captains resigning and also being reduced to the ranks, they not being allowed to leave the militia due to the rules of compulsory service. The situation was rectified when General Napier was replaced in 1848. From 1845, compulsory service was not required for men aged over 45, except in time of war. Uniforms for the three regiments continued with differing facings, North was Green, the West had Black and the South Blue. A review of Guernsey's defences in 1852 recommended the construction of three artillery barracks, Fort Richmond, Fort Hommet, and Fort Le Marchant, the upgrading of Fort Doyle, and the construction of Br√©hon Tower, the latter was completed in 1856. Rifles were changed to breach loading in 1870. In 1873 the British army provided a regular army adjutant and staff to each regiment. Arsenal buildings were constructed, partly for use by the artillery regiments, partly as drill halls. The Town Arsenal being built in 1850 and became the headquarters of the Militia. Other arsenals for the 2nd and 3rd regiments being built in 1882. The Town Arsenal being used by the Guernsey Fire Brigade from 1935. A detachment of the Royal Guernsey Militia attended the 1897 Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria as well as competing at Bisley. Guernsey won the Kolapore Cup, a shooting competition open to all countries in the British Empire, excluding the mother country, in 1898 at Bisley. In 1899 Private William A. Priaulx won the Queen's Prize at Bisley, considered the most coveted prize in the shooting world. The British system of appointing British officers caused some difficulties, it must be remembered that French was the main language of the Island and service was obligatory. There was trouble and resentment which culminated in 1899 when the North regiment mutinied and was then disbanded. The end of the century saw the start of the Anglo Boer War. The Island was very patriotic with many men, who would have been militia men, volunteering to fight for the Queen. 20th century In 1901 Guernsey passed a law confirming that service was compulsory, unless exempted, with an upper age of 60 in time of war and 45 in time of peace. 10 years active service, with an establishment of 1,000 during peace and 2,000 in time of war, comprising one artillery regiment, two of infantry and two infantry reserves. The law also confirmed the Army Act 1881 applied to the Island. In 1901 it was reported that any man in Guernsey, when called upon, was bound by law to attend with pay 21 days of training with the Militia until he was declared efficient this training took place during the month of August any man failing to make the grade had to return the following year until he qualified. In February 1906 militiamen became eligible for the Militia Long Service Medal. The medal was awarded for 18 years of efficient and irreproachable service in the Militia and attending 15 annual camps. German proclamation of measures against Hubert Nicolle, James Symes, Ambrose Sherwill, and others following Operation Ambassador The Royal Guernsey Militia, comprising two infantry regiments and an artillery regiment, could not fight as a unit outside the island except to help the King regain his throne. Accordingly, the militia was disbanded in 1916 to allow the Royal Guernsey Light Infantry to be raised, the Island waiving its rights and allowing the first battalion of the regiment to serve overseas and introducing conscription. A second (reserve) battalion remaining in Guernsey. Casualties in France were high. 327 died, 667 wounded and 255 became prisoners. The severely depleted regiment becoming GHQ troops guarding General Haig from April 1918. From 1920 Royal Guernsey Militia and Royal Alderney Artillery Militia British army numbers were in the block 7539001 ‚Äì 7560000 (Use of the numbers were discontinued in 1929). Reinstated after World War I in 1922, the militia was scaled back in 1929, following a reduction in funding, to a small volunteer force. The militia was demilitarised in 1940, with all equipment being shipped to England just before the invasion of Guernsey by German forces. One former member of the militia, Lt. Hubert Nicholle who had travelled to England in 1939 to join the Hampshire Regiment agreed to travel back to Guernsey by the British submarine where on 7 July 1940 he undertook a successful reconnaissance of German defences in the Island during the lead up to Operation Ambassador, before being picked up on 10 July. Undertaking a second landing with fellow Guernseyman Lt. James Symes on 3 September 1940, in civilian clothing, the pickup arrangements failed and the two were forced to surrender, after having obtained help from Ambrose Sherwill to get Guernsey Militia uniforms, being treated as POWs rather than shot as spies. Nicholle was awarded the MC. The militia was reconstituted after the war, however in 1951 the States of Guernsey finally decided not to revive the militia.

The player attempts to protect their ship from a rain of enormous drops of slime by deflecting them into canisters, while fending off attacks by an alien flying saucer. Gameplay The player is in control of a ship floating in the Sargasso Sea, which is now filled with a slime created by the evil alien Plexarian Invincibles. The game opens with a slime storm approaching, which causes huge drops of slime to slowly fall from the top of the screen. The slime is deadly, destroying the player's ship if it hits it. To the left and right of the ship, constraining its motion to the center of the screen, are Gamma-Tube Absorbers which can destroy the falling slime if the drops fall into it. Any slime that does not fall into the Absorbers causes the sea level to rise, moving all of the action up the screen. Opening scene of Slime, with the initial set of wedges in place. A single drop has made it by the wedges and is about to fall into the sea. The red triangle shape is the cursor. The player's task is to cause the slime to fall into the Absorbers using a total of 20 wedges that deflect the slime to the side as it falls. At the start of each level, a number of these wedges are already in place forming diagonal barriers, although there is always a hole in the middle that is left unprotected. The player's joystick controls an on-screen cursor that can be positioned in the empty areas, and pressing the fire button causes a new wedge to appear if that location is empty, or remove one if it is already there. Lines of wedges can be produced by holding down the fire button and moving the joystick in the desired direction. Additionally, the Plexians have sent a flying saucer that creates large lightning bolts that destroy some of the wedges it hits. The bolts can also destroy the ship, but they only reach about halfway down the screen so they are only dangerous if the sea level has risen. At higher levels, the saucer also fires fireballs that can destroy individual wedges no matter where they are, and can also seal the Absorbers. In the latter case, a helicopter will appear to attempt to open the Absorber again, and must be protected from the slime. All of the enemies in the game, including the slime drops, can be destroyed by triggering a wedge on them. Since the wedges appear slowly and the enemies move fairly rapidly, this is not an easy task. Development Synapse Software's first success was 1981's Protector, and quickly followed by a number of games written by a small number of programmers. Slime was one of the many games released during this earlier period. The basic concept was developed by Synapse's president, Ihor Wolosenko. The project was originally given to a new member of the Synapse team and some progress was made, but the programmer decided to leave the company. Hales had been working on another game, Fort Apocalypse, and was pulled off its development to finish Slime. The resulting delay meant Broderbund's Choplifter reached the market first, and Fort Apocalypse was often considered a me-too effort. Reception Antic said \\"Slime is a fiendishly clever, delightfully disgusting game that's guaranteed to give you green dreams for weeks after you get it\\", but complained about the controls, saying they became difficult to use at higher levels and suggested using a trackball might be a solution. Electronic Fun was unimpressed with the game, giving it a 1.5 out of 4 score, saying it was part of a trend in gaming that was \\"sacrificing game play in order to achieve originality\\". Their main complaint was the overly sensitive controls, calling them \\"unwieldy and terribly jumpy\\", and to a lesser degree, the sound effects that the reviewer thought were \\"probably the worst ever heard on any computer game\\". A more recent retrogameing review gave it a C+ rating, calling it \\"one of Synapse‚Äôs weaker entries into Atari 8-bit games\\". Super Storm Super Storm on the TI-99/4 was never released commercially. Slime, under the title Super Storm, was one of a number of titles Atari ported to other platforms under their Atarisoft brand. A number of Super Storm game cartridges for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A were manufactured, but were not released after the company was purchased by Jack Tramiel.

The Parker Prize is awarded each year for an ‚Äúoutstanding article‚Äù published in PMLA‚Äîthe association's primary journal, and widely considered the most prestigious in the study of modern languages and literatures. It was first awarded in 1964 to David J. DeLaura, then a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, for his article, ‚ÄúArnold and Carlyle,‚Äù which had been published in the March 1964 issue of PMLA. In 1968, the prize was named for former PMLA editor and MLA Secretary William Riley Parker. Parker, a professor at Indiana University, was a Milton biographer whose scholarship also considered the formation of literary studies in the United States.  Notable winners  Previous winners of the prize have included Fredric Jameson, Walter Ong, and Pauline Yu. Only two scholars have won the award multiple times. Elisabeth Schneider of the University of California at Santa Barbara, received the award in 1966 and 1973.. George T. Wright of the University of Minnesota received the award in 1974 and 1981. The prize has only twice been awarded for an article published by a scholar still in graduate school. David Wayne Thomas, now an associate professor at the University of Notre Dame, was awarded the prize for an article he published while a graduate student at the University of California, Davis. Thomas's article, \\"G√∂del's Theorem and Postmodern Theory,\\" appeared in the March 1995 issue PMLA. More recently, Gordon Fraser was awarded the prize for \\"Troubling the Cold War Logic of Annihilation,\\" an article published in the May 2015 issue of PMLA. Fraser, now a faculty member at the University of Manchester, was at the time a Ph.D. candidate in English at the University of Connecticut. Scholars from the University of Virginia have won the award the greatest number of times, having received the prize in 2000, 1997, and 1979, and having received an honorable mention in 1969.

From 1951 to 1958 he worked at the Geophysics Research Directorate of the Air Force Cambridge Research Center where he was the leader of the meteorological equipment development program for the Air Force. From 1958 to 1961 he was manager of research at Teledynamics, Inc., and then accepted appointment at the newly formed National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) as Director of the National Scientific Balloon Facility. In 1965 he established the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) to develop long-duration balloons.Clip, Oral History Interview with Vincent Lally. (1993). American Meteorological Society.

Early 1960s launch of a zero-pressure balloon from the floor of Glen Canyon before a scientific balloon facility was operational. The windbreak provided by the Glen Canyon Dam provided an ideal location for inflating and launching balloons. After the dam was complete, however, the canyon was flooded to create Lake Powell.  Scientific achievements  In addition to leading the national program to develop facilities for scientific ballooning, Lally made a number of major contribution to the use of balloons as a vehicle for atmospheric measurements. The demonstration of the capability to fly superpressure balloons on multiple orbits of the globe was the critical experiment which triggered international support for the Global Atmospheric Research Program. In 1966, NCAR scientists launched a globe-circling balloon from Christchurch, New Zealand. This was one of a series of global horizontal sounding technique (GHOST) balloons tested in order to collect meteorological data from all of the earth's atmosphere and predict global weather on a long-range basis.Scientific balloon circles the globe, Information Releases, Archives, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The Rocket-Balloon-Instrument sphere (ROBIN), designed in 1955, was the principal vehicle for rocket soundings of the atmosphere. Lally also developed the technique for reliable erection of space-inflatables. The Radiation-Controlled Balloon (RACOON) demonstrated in 1980 that the radiation- environment rather than ballast could achieve long-duration flight for zero- pressure balloons. It became the standard technique for global flight and recovery of heavy scientific payloads.Vincent Lally Papers. NCAR Archives Digital Collection.  Publications  Lally authored over 30 papers on instrumentation, ballooning, and navigation techniques. he wrote the definitive publication on superpressure-ballooning as well as chapters in several handbooks on ballooning and atmospheric sounding systems.

The eggs are 1.5 to 1.7 mm in diameter, and the sheath is 3.0 to 3.8 mm in diameter. Classification Paleozoic eggs are rare in the fossil record. Some coelacanth eggs (belonging to Rhabdoderma exiquum) are known, as well as the eggs of sharks, but Mazonova is quite distinct. They closely resemble the strands of eggs laid by some modern fish and amphibians, as well as opisthobranch mollusks. However, the eggs are far too large to be mollusk eggs, indicating they represent eggs of a vertebrate, though it is impossible to assign them to any order.

It was occupied and enlarged by the Robertson Paper Company between 1907 and its failure in 1987, at which time it was the longest-lived paper company in the state. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It was demolished in 2018-19 as a Brownfields Economic Revitalization Alliance (BERA) project, with federal, state, and local funding.Press release about demolition https://accd.vermont.gov/press-releases/12-million-clean-under-way-former- robertson-paper-mill-site-bellows-falls Description and history The former Robertson Paper Company plant was located near the center of the island formed by the Connecticut River to the east and the Bellows Falls Canal to the west. The main factory, an interconnected group of eight structures, was located on the east side of Island Street, with the town's main rail yard to the north and the former Bellows Falls Co-operative Creamery Complex to the east. The building had long frontage along Island Street, which slopes downhill toward the rail yard, where a basement story was exposed. This northern section housed the company offices, which were accessed through entrances at the basement level. The southern end of the factory, which sported a monitor roof, was its main manufacturing area. Additional sections extended the building north and east, and included one section housing a freight elevator to bring goods down to the level of the rail yard. The oldest portion of the complex, its main manufacturing area, was built about 1890 by C.W. Osgood and Son, a maker of papermaking machinery. Successors to this firm enlarged the premises, and were eventually merged into the Robertson Paper Company in 1907. Robertson was founded in 1881, and was at first engaged in the manufacture of tissue paper in a plant at the southern end of the island. It expanded into the manufacture of waxed paper, and was, at the time of its acquisition of this plant, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of that product. The firm remained in business at this site, under a variety of names and ownerships, until 1987, when it succumbed to bankruptcy. It was at that time the longest continuously operational paper company in the state.

One can visit the church and the adjoining convent of the Carmelites (today the police station‚Äôs premises) in Piazza Libert√†.  History The original body of the church was built during the Aragonese rule in Sicily, very probably between 1332 and 1379, although it would in all likelihood date back to 1032. This church has gone through various enlargements, readaptations and changes during the centuries, particularly in the 16th and 17th. The square bell tower, located on the right side of the entrance, was realised at the beginning of the 15th century and was accessible from the church. Beginning from the 16th century they started a second elevation and later on they built a music stand which was leaning on an arch stretching from the bell tower as far as the new protruding chapel, in this way the decorations above the door and the circular window were cut and a sort of colonnade in front of the church was created. About the 16th century in the Church there was the Confraternity of Saint Blaise, which probably converged later in the Confraternity of the Annunciation. In 1537 the oratory adjoining the church was rebuilt by the Confraternity of Maria Santissima Annunziata. In 1752 this confraternity was promoted a company. Further to the abolition of religious orders in 1866, the Carmelites were expelled from the convent, which was transformed into barracks, while the church was neglected. The friars tried to get it back again, but the negotiations dragged on and, when the government decided to give it back, the roof had fallen down and the church had already ruined as from the end of the 19th century. In 1950 the Confraternity of Maria Santissima Annunziata passed to the church of Saint Olivia and it reassumed the title of confraternity in 1954, but it came to an end a short time after. The church, which is usually closed to public, is often used for cultural events, mainly exhibitions and concerts.

The church, with a trapezoidal plan, had a nave and two aisles separated by two rows of tuff columns, with very low capitals decorated with floral forms and animals, each one different from the other. Each row of columns was surmounted by five pointed arches of Catalan and Italic style (called ‚Äúa terzo punto‚Äù). Today from the original structure there are only a series of columns on the right nave academia.edu - Ignazio Longo, \\"Chiesa Maria SS. Annunziata\\") and some chapels enriched by precious decorative elements. The wooden saddle roof, which was higher above the presbytery, does not exist any longer. At the end of the church there are three apses, also surmounted by pointed arches. The three naves are separated by three arches from the presbytery, which is a step higher than the floor of the naves. Under the presbytery there is a crypt used for public sepulchre. Its entrance is next to the elevated step. Inside this crypt there is a painting of the Holy Crucified. The front door has two large decorative fillets adorned with intaglios representing leaf work of Norman style. On the fa√ßade above the door there is a circular perforated window; on the right side of the door you can see a bell tower dating back to the 15th century. The church walls and pillars were decorated with frescoes: most of them are not visible now because of an incautious whitewashing of the walls. Above all they have discovered the images of a monk and a crucifix. The Annunciation by the Gagini, hosted in church of Saint Olivia. On the high altar there was a white marble sculpture entitled ‚ÄúThe Annunciation‚Äù representing the kneeling Virgin with the Archangel Gabriel next to her and the Holy Father above them. This work was realized in 1545 by Antonino Gagini and Giacomo Gagini. In 1906 it was placed in Saint Olivia's Church, while the statue of Madonna of Carmelo, realized in paper pulp and carried in procession by the friars, is hosted inside Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church. According to Father Facciponte, a Jesuit, very probably the white alabaster holy water stoup, with bas-reliefs representing the Announcer Angel and the Virgin, which today are inside the Church of the College of Jesuits or church of Jesus, probably come from this church too.

Maa Shoolini the Mahashakti, the form and formless, is the root of knowledge, wisdom, creation, preservation and annihilation. She is Shakti or power of lord shiva. Maa Shoolini manifested with the blessing of Lord Shiva to tame Narsingh, the 4th avatar of Lord Vishnu, and to protect the universe as Narsingh was becoming a threat to the universe due to his fury. Maa Shoolini is also popularly known as Dhuruvi, Dhuru ki Devi, Shoolini Durga, Shivrani, Shulini Devi, Saloni Devi, Salonee Devi; you can call her with any name, what matters is the purity of heart. She is also called \\"Paharon ki Rani\\", \\"Queen of Mountains or \\"Queen of Himalayas\\" She is the Kul Devi of people of Solan.  Manifestation or Incarnation of Maa Shoolini  left It was the time when Lord Vishnu took the form of Lord Narasimha to save his devotee Prahlad - this was the 4th avatar of Lord Vishnu. Narasimha is half-man and half-lion, having a human-like torso and lower body, with a lion- like face and claws. After Narasimha killed Hiranyakashyap, none of the devis or devtas were able to calm his fury. Narasimha started on a spree of destruction, and no one could calm him. After listening to requests by Goddess Laxmi and prayers from Devi Devtas, Lord Shiva decided to tame Lord Narasimha. It was only Lord Shiva who could tame him - no one except the 'Devon ka Dev Mahadev' had the power to calm him. > Thus Lord Shiva took on the incarnated form of Sharabha, Sarabeshwara, to > tame Narasimha. This form was part bird and part lion, and is also called > Sharabeshwaramurti. Lord Sharbha, Right Wing is Maa Shoolini This fierce form of Lord Shiva, Sarabeshwara was an eight-legged beast, mightier than a lion or an elephant - and capable of killing a lion. Lord Shiva, Maa Shoolini on Right Wing and Maa Durga on Left Wing And if you look carefully in the picture you can see Maa Shoolini in the right wing of Sharabhaji. She is black in color - that is why she is called Saloni. She is also holding a weapon called a 'Shool' and so She is also called 'Shool Dharini' - and is a form of Maa Kali or Maa Durga. She is also known as Shoolini Durga'. thumb But this was not the end after Lord Shiva (Sharbha) taming Narasimha, then again Vishnu ji assumed the form of the ferocious Gandaberunda bird-animal to combat Lord Shiva, Sharabha the super power. The Linga Purana and Sharabha Upanishad also mention this mutilation of Narasimha and Gandaberuda. After Narasimha avatar got tame by Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu could not calm himself, got angry and again took a form of Gandaberuda. Gandaberuda having two heads, rows of teeth, black in complexion and wide wings. The destructive energy of Narasimha as Gandaberuda (Vishnu) in form of two headed bird began to fight fiercely with Lord Sharbha (Lord Shiva) for eighteen days. After such a fierce fight Lord Vishnu as Gandaberuda bowed to Lord Shiva and stopped the fight and Lord Sharbha ( Lord Shiva) tore apart the two headed bird Gandaberuda. Lord Vishnu prayed to Lord Shiva and bowed to him and displayed his peace and Finally Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu transformed back in their own form of Bholey Nath. The purpose of Lord Shiva assuming the form of Sharabha was to ensure that the lion body of Vishnu was discarded and he got united with his original divine form. Truth is :Shiv hi Shakti hai, Shakti hi Shiva hai, :Shakti Shiv bina adhuri, aur Shiv bin Shakti adhure :Shiv hi Mahesh, Shiv hi Vishnu, Shiv hi Brahma :Shakti hi Parvati, Shakti hi Laxmi, Shakti hi Saraswati. :Shiva Shankar Bola Jati Sati, Aadha Shiv Aadhi Parvati :Jo samajh gaya woh paar hua, jo na samjha woh mand mati  Shoolini Mela  342x342px Shoolini Mela Solan, the Mushroom city of India acquires its name from the sacred shrine of Goddess Shoolini positioned in Solan.

The Mata Durga Temple of the Ganj Bazar is the ultimate destination of Goddess Shoolini which is regarded to be the abode of her sister Durga Devi. The Goddess Shoolini halts at her sister's place for three days and then returns to her own domicile.

He was violently anti-clerical. Albert was Minister of Education in 1924‚Äì25, and Minister of Labor in 1933. As education minister he promoted secular state schools (√©coles uniques), state support for education of poor children, and reform of the curriculum to place greater emphasis on sciences and modern languages. Early years Fran√ßois Albert was born in Bordeaux on 4 April 1877. He attended the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and gained a diploma in literature and a license in law. He taught literature in Laon and Paris, then became a journalist. He contributed to l'Aurore, Georges Clemenceau's l'Homme libre, La D√©p√™che de Toulouse, the Revue politique et parlementaire and l'Ere nouvelle. Political career Albert was elected to represent the canton of Vouill√© in the general council of Vienne. In 1920 he was elected senator for Vienne. Albert was known for his hostility to clericalism, and was vocal in opposition to reopening the French embassy to the Vatican. In the early 1920s there was heated debate between proponents of the repartition proportionelle scolaire, which would allow for state-supported religious schools, and the √©cole unique in which all state schools would be secular. Albert represented the radicals at a February 1922 meeting arranged by the Ligue de la R√©publique to discuss defense of the secular public school, an area where the socialists and radicals were in agreement. Albert became president of the Ligue de l'enseignement (Education League) shortly before being appointed Minister of Public Education in √âdouard Herriot's mainly Radical government in 1924. He was Minister of Education from 14 June 1924 to 17 April 1925. Albert introduced an initial reform to the lyc√©e (secondary school) curriculum on 9 August 1924 in which all pupils would now study French, history, geography and sciences. The student could choose in the last four years whether to concentrate on classics, modern languages, or science. In September he ordered that primary inspectors should have authority over elementary classes of the lycee, and these classes should accept capable primary school students. At the annual meeting of the Ligue de l'enseignement in Valence on 1 November 1924 Albert gave a speech in which he violently attacked the Jesuits, whom he accused of wanting to suppress the university. Jean Guiraud (1866‚Äì1953), editor of the Roman Catholic La Croix (The Cross), described Albert as \\"uniting in his person the action of masonry and official action in national education\\". Guiraud said the √©cole unique was \\"a sectarian enterprise that aims at establishing the monopoly of the atheist state.\\" Herriot announced a committee on the √©cole unique chaired by Ferdinand Buisson on 7 December 1924. At its first meeting, on 23 December 1924, Albert said the committee should keep in mind the importance of the √©cole unique as a symbol of democracy. They should avoid religious questions, and should focus on developing practical recommendations for reform by 1 April 1925. In January 1925 Albert unified the examinations for secondary education scholarships so they covered studies at both the lyc√©e and the √©cole primaire sup√©rieures. Albert was defeated in the senatorial election in 1927. In 1928 Albert ran for election as deputy in the Melle constituency of Deux-S√®vres and was elected in the first round of voting. He was reelected in 1932. In June 1932 he succeeded √âdouard Herriot as leader of the Radical Socialist group in the chamber. He was Minister of Labor from 31 January 1933 to 25 October 1933 in the first cabinet of √âdouard Daladier. In the summer of 1933 he agreed to meet Alexandre Stavisky with Suzanne Avril and her father, the deputy Gaston Hulin. He listened while Stavisky outlined his grandiose plan to revive the French economy by using the proceeds of bonds backed by the agrarian fund to finance public works. Albert promised to consider the matter, and communicated further with Stavisky via Hulin, but was uneasy about the scheme and took no action before his death. Fran√ßois Albert died in Paris of an intestinal illness on 23 November 1933. He was a Knight of the Legion of Honour.

He was deeply influenced by romanticism; his models were Andr√© Ch√©nier and Lord Byron. Learning in March 1823 of Byron‚Äôs involvement in the Greek War of Independence, he tried to join him but was delayed in Italy after a shipwreck. He was still in Venice when he learned that his hero had died and Ipsara Island had been captured by the Turks. In 1831, he went to Warsaw to help the Polish insurgents and was appointed aide-de-camp to General Henryk Dembi≈Ñski. He was wounded and taken prisoner by the Austrians. His father, a civil servant for the Ministry of Finance, was a fierce opponent of Romanticism; which he ridiculed through poems and parodies. This made Lef√®vre's relationship with his father all the more difficult. The title of one of his early poems, Le Parricide (1819), bears testimony to their tense relationship. From a very young age he was greatly admired by the new generation, including Alexandre Soumet and Victor Hugo, who may have drawn inspiration from Lef√®vre's poem M√©ditation d‚Äôun proscrit sur la peine de mort (Meditation of an outcast on death penalty) for his own Dernier Jour d‚Äôun condamn√© (Last Day of a man sentenced to death). He was strongly opposed to the death penalty and his poem, M√©ditation d‚Äôun proscrit sur la peine de mort, is one of the first French poetic text to advocate its abolition. Towards the end of his life he was among the first to experiment with prose poetry in his Livre du Promeneur (Hiker's book). He gave his support to Napoleon III, who subsequently appointed him librarian of the Elys√©e and later of the Tuileries. His given name was Lef√®vre, to which he later added Deumier in honor of an aunt who had bequeathed him her considerable fortune. In February 1836 he married sculptor and writer Marie-Louise-Roulleaux Dugage, with whom he had two sons, Maxime (born 1837) and Lazare Eus√®be (born 1841).

Company Gas South began operations in 2006 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cobb Electric Membership Corporation. Georgia‚Äôs natural gas industry was partially deregulated in 1997 with the passing of the Natural Gas Competition and Deregulation Act, giving commercial and residential customers in many parts of the state a range of options. Under deregulation, the local distribution company, Atlanta Gas Light Company (AGLC), elected to no longer serve as a retail gas supplier and instead solely maintain and operate the distribution system. AGL is responsible for ensuring gas delivery, managing storage assets and transportation services on behalf of natural gas marketers. In turn, natural gas marketers sell gas directly to retail customers on a competitive basis. On September 1, 2016, Gas South increased the minimum wage for all employees to $15.00 per hour, well above the $5.15 per hour required by the state of Georgia, and was recognized as a Best Places to Work company. Manon Brochu, Gas South's Vice President, serves on the advisory board for the Salvation Army. Since 2009, Gas South has donated more than $200,000 to the United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta and the Salvation Army‚Äôs Project SHARE though its partnership with the Atlanta Braves.

Personal life  Carter Walker Wesley was born in 1892 in Houston, Texas. He grew up in the city's first and most successful black neighborhood, Freedmen's Town. Shortly after completing high school, Carter moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and graduated magna cum laude in 1917 from Fisk University. Taking inspiration from W. E. B. Du Bois and other black leaders and writers, Wesley joined the NAACP and started a career in law. Soon after graduation, World War I started and interrupted his plans. He enrolled in a black officer's training camp at Fort Des Moines in Iowa, and eventually was commissioned as a first lieutenant. Wesley had three children and was married to Dorris Wooten. After a career as a lawyer and newspaper publisher, he died in Houston on November 10, 1969, aged 77, and was buried in Paradise Cemetery (North), in Houston, Texas.  Military career  During World War I, Wesley volunteered to be in the U.S. Army through a program called the black officers training program. He eventually went on to serve as a lieutenant in France until 1918. Wesley and his unit were sent to Europe where he fought in the Argonne and Verdun regions. In 1918, Wesley was assigned to 372nd infantry regiment in France and trained with French officers. Later he transferred to the 370th Infantry Regiment and fought in the battle of Oise-Aisne the same year. He commanded the company when the captain became wounded. He was released in 1919 after returning from the 93rd Infantry Division  Legal career Wesley was inspired by W. E. B. Du Bois and various black leaders to join the NAACP and began his career in law. He began attending law school at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, before World War I and became active in civil rights issues as an attorney. At one point, he suggested that the NAACP stop depending on white attorneys to work on cases in Texas. Wesley worked with members of the NAACP, including Thurgood Marshall, to fight the state of Texas and the Texas Democratic Party in order to end the racially discriminatory white primary election. Texas claimed that it had no role in the primary because that was the exclusive domain of the state Democratic Party. Wesley and his law partner James Nabrit Jr. challenged this theory, but the Court upheld the white primary in Grovey v. Townsend, 295 U.S. 45, 55 S. Ct. 622, 792 L. Ed. 1292 (1932). Wesley did not give up the fight, and although it took until 1944, in Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S. Ct. 757, 88 L. Ed. 987 (1944), the Court finally struck down the Texas white primary, finding that the discriminatory voting practice was unconstitutional. Wesley was also an instrument in desegregating the University of Texas Law School, by providing support for Heman Sweatt, who was not admitted because he was black. Wesley even employed Sweatt at one of his newspapers while the suit was going through the courts.  Newspaper and publishing career Active in the civil rights movement as an attorney, Wesley eventually became interested in the power of the press, and switched his focus to the publishing industry. He took a job with the Houston Informer, a newspaper for African-Americans, and became the editor of the paper in 1929. Wesley was then promoted to vice president of the newspaper company in 1930 and became manager by the end of 1932. He eventually took a controlling interest in the newspaper and help it grow to become, in 1945, the largest black-owned business in Houston. Wesley was also the owner of the Dallas Express, one of the papers published by Freedman's Publishing Company. He was sent with 10 other black publishers to Germany to \\"investigate claims of discrimination against black servicemen in that country.\\"  References  American newspaper people Journalists from Houston Businesspeople from Houston African-American people Fisk University alumni United States Army officers 1892 births 1969 deaths ","title":"Carter Walker Wesley"},{"id":"48470268","title":"2015‚Äì16 Bethune‚ÄìCookman Wildcats men's basketball team"},{"id":"48470270","text":"Shivalinga is a 2016 Indian Kannada-language horror Mystery comedy thriller film written and directed by P.

Plot Raheem (Shakthi Vasudevan) and his well-trained pigeon Saara are alone in a coach aboard a train when a blind man enters and reaches to door. Raheem saves the man, a killer, who in turn throws Raheem off the moving train to his death. Raheem's death is ruled a suicide, but his fianc√©e Sangeetha (Vaishali Deepak) knows that Raheem had no reason to kill himself. The same night, Raheem appears in Sangeetha's dream and says that he was murdered. The following day, Raheem's case is forwarded to CID Shiva at Sangeetha's request. Shiva (Shivarajkumar) is a strict CID officer who is married to a thrill-seeker named Satyabhama (Vedika). The two live near a cemetery. Shiva is assigned Raheem's case and begins the investigation. The same night, Satya sees a ghost of a child and is frightened by this. Shiva, however, could not see the ghost and thinks that she is imagining things. The following day, Shiva visits Raheem's home to investigate Raheem's relationship with his father and Sangeetha. Shiva suspects Sangeetha's father (Avinash) to be responsible for Raheem's death. Satya's behaviour becomes erratic. She drives around the city wearing a black dress, redecorates the house with green curtains and lights, and she cooks biryani, even though she has never made the dish before. Later, a house servant (Sadhu Kokila) and a few other maids tell Shiva about Satya's strange behavior. Shiva meets his friend Ashok, who is a psychiatrist. He advises Shiva to observe her behaviour secretly. That night, Shiva returns home early. He hears a man's voice and smells a cigar burning. He heads to Satya's room and is shocked to discover that Raheem's soul has possessed her body. Raheem warns Shiva that he must solve Raheem's murder. Shiva accesses the security footage at the Bangalore railway station and discovers that the blind man is the killer. Shiva tracks down the blind man and chases him, finally cornering him on a train coach with no passengers. Satya, who is still possessed by Raheem, enters and demands to know why the blind man killed him. The blind man tries to escape by jumping out of the moving train, but he ends up falling to his death. Shiva takes Satya to a Darga, informing only Satya's mother (Vinaya Prasad) about her condition. Baba (Pradeep Rawat), a holy demonologist, helps them send Raheem's soul out of Satya's body but tells them that it is temporary. He tells Shiva that solving Raheem's case is the only way to save Satya completely. Shiva starts the investigation piece by piece, and Saara helps Shiva by giving him clues. Shiva interrogates Satya at the CID Conference Hall regarding Raheem. Satya reveals that Raheem had got back her Tablet Mobile, which was absconded by a pickpocketer. Satya gets a snap of Raheem for the sake of friendship. Satya's friend gets jealous about this (the friend had proposed to Satya, but she had denied his love). Out of jealousy and wanting to ruin Satya's life, the friend made a call to Satya's residential landline. It was Satya's father (Ashok) who answered the call (he was already spying on Satya). The piece of information made him angry, and he decided to kill innocent Raheem. Then, after unveiling the truth, Raheem's ghost possess Satya's father and kills him instantaneously.

Gameplay In Conquest Earth, the player can choose to play as Jovians, aliens from Jupiter, or humans. Humans and Jovians have different menu layouts and tactics which they can employ for offensive and defensive actions. Also, the Jovians must deal with the atmosphere of the Earth, which obstructs their view, by using special troops; the humans also face a problem in the sulphur shrouds of Jupiter. The player can take direct control over any unit, or delegate control to commanders. There is a system called \\"way-points\\", which allows the players to bind together multiple locations and thus directly give the units a path which they will follow. The Jovians have several tactical maneuvers, including transforming into vehicles and other objects. All enemies will adapt to the moves made in the game, while actively testing the defense or ambushing the troops. The game uses DirectDraw to enhance the game's terrain and unit visuals, and Real-time stereo distancing for the sounds. It implements its own view system for battles. A picture-in-picture option allows to view 3 locations at the same time. The player can choose from two modes of play, normal real-time strategy, or a more complicated variant.

The term enactment was first introduced by Theodore Jacobs (1986) to describe the re-actualization of unsymbolized and unconscious emotional experiences involved in the relationship between the patient and the therapist.Jacobs Th. (1986), On contertransference enactments, Journ. of Am. Psychoan. Ass., 34, pp. 289-307. More precisely, Jacobs refers to the countertransference enactment, thus highlighting the implications of the personality characteristics, affective frame, representations and analyst's conflicts for the patient and the interactional behaviour. In relational psychoanalysis, the concept of enactment is usually used to explain the re‚Äìexperience of a role assumed during childhood, which is recited on the stage of the analyst's consulting room: the analyst is given a specific role to play; both the patient and the analyst lose in this context their sense of distance, interacting with each other verbally and non‚Äìverbally, leading to intra-psychic dynamics in the form of interactions within the therapeutic setting. According to relational theorists, though enactments are unconscious patterns of dyadic interactions to which both the analyst and the patient contribute, they are generally considered to be initiated by the latter. In the perspective of relational psychoanalysis, the central aspect of therapeutic change is given by the liberation of the patient and the analyst from the repetitive unconscious patterns due to the reflective awareness' acquisition of the relational interchange and the contribution of both parties. Traumatized patients tend to bond with their therapists not so much through words as through enactments, expressing unconsciously‚Äîby the action‚Äîthe dissociated aspects of the self and the object representation.Cesare Albasi (2006), Attaccamenti traumatici.

The observatory would try to search for objects in the Kuiper belt and the theorized Oort cloud by conducting blind occultation observations. Although the Oort cloud was hypothized in the 1950s, it has not yet been directly observed. The mission would attempt to detect Oort cloud objects by scanning for brief moments where the objects would block the light of background stars. In 2011, six finalists were selected for the 2016 Discovery Program, and Whipple was not among them, but it was awarded funding to continue its technological development efforts.

It would be designed to detect objects out to . Some of the mission goals included directly detecting the Oort cloud for the first time and determining the outer limit of the Kuiper belt. Whipple would be designed to detect objects as small as a kilometer (half a mile) across at a distance of . Its telescope would need a relatively wide field of view and fast recording cadence to capture transits that may last only seconds.A Fast, Wide Field of View, Catadioptric Telescope for Whipple In 2011, Whipple was one of three proposals to win a technology development award in a Discovery Program selection. The design proposed was a catadioptric Cassegrain telescope with a 77-centimeter aperture (30.3 inches). It would have a wide field of view with a fast read-out CMOS detector to achieve the desired time and photometric sensitivity. The smallest KBO yet detected was discovered in 2009 by poring over data from the Hubble Space Telescope's fine guidance sensors. Astronomers detected a transit of an object against a distant star, which, based on the duration and amount of dimming, was calculated to be a KBO about in diameter. It has been suggested that the Kepler observatory may be able to detect objects in the Oort cloud by their occultation of background stars.

In a racing career which lasted from 1997 until 2000 he won nine of his fifteen races including four Grade I races. He was the leading juvenile colt in Japan in 1997 when he was unbeaten in four races, culminating in a victory in the Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes. He missed most of his second season with injury problems but returned in autumn to win the Arima Kinen. He reached his peak as a four-year-old when he won the Takarazuka Kinen and a second Arima Kinen. He failed to win in three races in 2000 and was retired to stud. He has had some success as a breeding stallion. Background Grass Wonder is a chestnut horse with a white star, standing 15.3¬Ω hands high bred in Kentucky by Phillips Racing Partnership & John Phillips, of the Darby Dan Farm. He was sired by Silver Hawk, an American-bred colt who finished third in the 1982 Epsom Derby and later became a successful breeding stallion, siring the 1997 Epsom Derby winner Benny the Dip, the 1999 St Leger winner Mutafaweq and the leading American turf performer Hawkster. Grass Wonder's dam Ameriflora was an unraced daughter of Danzig. She was a great-granddaughter of Soaring, an American broodmare who was the ancestor of many major winners including Glorious Song, Saint Ballado, Rahy and Singspiel. The yearling was consigned to the Keeneland sale in September 1996 and was bought for $250,000 by Nobuo Tsunoda. Grass Wonder auction history Grass Wonder was exported to Japan where he was trained by Mitsuhiro Ogata and was ridden in most of his races by Hitoshi Matoba. Racing career=1997: two- year-old season Grass Wonder began his racing by defeating nine opponents in a maiden race over 1800 metres at Nakayama Racecourse on 13 September 1997. A month later he followed up in the Ivy Stakes over 1400 metres at Tokyo Racecourse, winning from Machikane Sanshiro. In November he was moved up in class for the Grade II Keisei Hai Sansai Stakes over the same course and distance and won from Machikane Sanshiro and Courir Cyclone. On his final start of the season, Grass Wonder was one of fifteen colts to contest Japan's most prestigious race for juveniles, the Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes over 1600 metres at Nakayama on 7 December. Ridden by Matoba, he won by two and a half lengths from Meiner Love (later to win the Sprinters Stakes) who took second ahead of Figaro and Agnes World. In January 1998, Grass Wonder was voted Japanese Champion 2-Year-Old Colt at the JRA Awards. 1998: three-year-old season As a foreign-bred horse, Grass Wonder was not eligible to race in many of the major Japanese races for three-year-olds, and when he sustained a leg injury in March 1998 it was decided to reserve him for an autumn campaign. He made his first appearance of the year he finished fifth behind Silence Suzuka in the Grade II Mainichi Okan over 1800 metres at Tokyo in October. In the following month he was moved up in distance for the Grade II Copa Republica Argentina over 2500 metres at Tokyo and finished sixth behind Yusei Top Run. Despite his lack of form in 1998, Grass Wonder was one of sixteen horses selected to run in the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama on 27 December. His opponents included Air Groove (Yushun Himba, Tenno Sho (autumn)), Machikane Fukukitaru (Kikuka Sho), Mejiro Bright (Tenno Sho (spring)), Mejiro Dober (Shuka Sho, Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup), Offside Trap (Tenno Sho (autumn)), Seiun Sky (Satsuki Sho, Kikuka Sho), Silk Justice (Defending Champion), Stay Gold and Yusei Top Run. Grass Wonder won by half a length from Mejiro Bright with a gap of two and a half lengths back to Stay Gold who took third place ahead of Seiun Sky. 1999: four-year-old season Mitsuhiro Ogata, who trained Grass Wonder throughout his racing career Grass Wonder began his third season in the Grade II Keio Hai Spring Cup over 1400 metres at Tokyo on 15 May. He won by three quarters of a length from Air Jihad, to whom he was conceding four pounds. The unplaced horses included Phalaenopsis (Oka Sho, Shuka Sho) and the Godolphin challenger Lend A Hand (Gran Criterium). On June 13 over 1600 metres Grass Wonder faced Air Jihad at level weights in the Yasuda Kinen. He was beaten a nose by his rival with the pair finishing two and a half lengths clear of Seeking The Pearl (Prix Maurice de Gheest) in third place. Grass Wonder returned to middle distances for the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 11 July and was matched for the first time against Special Week a colt who had won the Tokyo Yushun in 1998 and the spring edition of the Tenno Sho. The other runners included Matikanefukukitaru and Stay Gold. Grass Wonder defeated Special Week with a gap of seven lengths back to Stay Gold in third. After a break of almost three months, Grass Wonder returned for the Grade II Mainichi Okan over 1800 metres at Tokyo on 10 October and won from Meisho Odo and Embrasser Moi. On 26 December at Nakayama, Grass Wonder attempted to become the fourth horse following Speed Symboli, Symboli Rudolf and Oguri Cap to win back-to-back runnings of the Arima Kinen. His main opponents in the fourteen runner field included Mejiro Bright, Narita Top Road (Kikuka Sho), Phalaenopsis, Special Week, Stay Gold, Symboli Indy (NHK Mile Cup) and T M Opera O (Satsuki Sho). The race produced a dramatic finish with the lead changing hand several times in the last 200 metres, but Grass Wonder prevailed by a nose and a neck from Special Week and T M Opera O with Tsurumaru Tsuyoshi half a length away in fourth. For his efforts over the course of the season, Grass Wonder was given a special award at the JRA Awards for 1999. 2000: five-year-old season Grass Wonder remained in training as a five-year-old colt but failed to reproduce his best form. He finished sixth behind Leo Ryuho in the Grade II Nikkei Sho over 2500 metres at Nakayama on 26 March and then ran unplaced behind the filly Stinger in the Keio Hai Spring Cup. In his final race the horse ran for the second time in the Takarazuka Kinen and finished sixth of the eleven runners behind T M Opera O.

Unrelated to the Gillette company which also used the name 'American Safety Razor Company' in 1901 until 1904 before it was renamed for its founder, King C. Gillette. The company produces a wide range of personal care, medical, industrial blades and cutting tools with international manufacturing operations in The Czech Republic, Germany, Israel, Mexico, and The United States. History Gem Safety Razor advertised at the 1920 World Series at Ebbets Field. Star Safety Razor In 1870, Frederick, Otto and Richard Kampfe immigrated from Saxony, Germany establishing a tool and die shop in Brooklyn, New York. After becoming frustrated with shaving, Frederick modified a straight razor by shortening the blade and setting it in a frame. The device became known as Kampfe's rake and was produced for friends and customers at the New York shop. In 1875 the brothers formed the Star Safety Razor company and on June 15, 1880 were granted a U.S. patent for the Star Razor, the first safety razor produced in the United States. Gem Cutlery Company After 23 years working for the Kampfe Brothers Jerry Reichard starts the Gem Cutlery Company in 1898. Its first product, the Gem Safety Razor, borrowed heavily from the Star Razor in design but soon outpaced the Star in sales. Ever-Ready In 1903 Jerry Reichard leaves Gem Safety Razor Company to form yet another razor and blade producer, along with August Scheuber the company was briefly named 'Reichard & Scheuber Manufacturing Company' before it became 'The Yankee Company'. The Yankee Company made wedge-blade razors under the name Yankee, Mohican & Winner. The Yankee Company, is renamed Ever-Ready in 1905. Gem & Ever-Ready merge in 1906 and is incorporated as the Personna American Safety Razor Company. In 1906, abandoning the wedge-blade design, they introduced the standard single edge rib-back blade that is still used today. In 1915 Ever- Ready Shaving Brushes were first introduced and continued to be produced until the early 1990s. Safetee Soap Corporation In December 1919 The Safetee Soap Corporation formed as a subsidiary of American Safety Razor Corporation and produced a line of shaving soaps, creams, powders, talc and aftershave lotions to complement the safety razor business. The Safetee Soap line was cross-promoted in pamphlets included in other ASR products. American Safety Razor Corporation Gem & Ever-Ready merged with Star to become the American Safety Razor Corporation in 1919. It was chartered in Virginia, while razor and blade production remained in Brooklyn. By 1921, it had produced 1,800,000 safety razors; 110,000,000 razor blades; 1,000,000 shaving brushes; 2,000,000 cakes of shaving soap. By 1942, it had introduced and popularized the phrase five o'clock shadow. In 1953, it acquired the Pal, Treet and Personna brands after purchasing the Pal Blade Company. These latter two product names continue to be made today. In 1954 the factory relocated to Staunton, Virginia, after the Brooklyn City Planning Commission's planned civic center encroached on the factory with plans to redevelop the industrial area into office and residential use. The American Safety Razor factory building at 333 Jay Street then became the new campus for the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. Seeking diversification Philip Morris acquires American Safety Razor in 1960. In 1963 American Safety Razor is the first maker of stainless steel blades, which were sold under the Personna brand name. In 1968, Philip Morris, purchased the Burma-Vita Company, makers of Burma-Shave. In 1970, the first blade made with tungsten steel was introduced, the Personna 74. In 1974 American Line Brand of industrial products was introduced, expanding the company into industrial blades. In 1977, executives purchased Personna American Safety Razor Company from Philip Morris in a management buyout. American Safety Razor filed for bankruptcy in July 2010, after declining earnings since 2008 and the loss of its largest customer Wal-Mart earlier in 2010. Energizer Holdings bought American Safety Razor in November 2010 for US$301 million. In 2015, Energizer Holdings spun off the personal care division as Edgewell Personal Care. The company also announced its intention to cut back its industrial blade production or completely sell the personal care division.

This is used as the basis for a variety of web- based technologies including JSON Web Token.  Purpose  JWS is a way to ensure integrity of information in a highly serializable, machine-readable format. That means that it is information, along with proof that the information hasn't changed since being signed. It can be used for sending information from one web site to another, and is especially aimed at communications on the web. It even contains a compact form optimized for applications like URI query parameters.  Examples  Web commerce = JWS can be used for applications in which digitally signed information must be sent in a machine-readable format, such as e-commerce. For example, say a user named Bob is browsing widget prices on a web site (widgets.com), and wishes to get a quote on one of them. Then widgets.com could provide Bob with a JWS object containing all relevant information about the widget, including the price, then sign it using their private key. Then Bob would have a non-repudiable price quote for the product. = Access to third-party resources = Maybe Widgets.com and WidgetStorage.com have a deal in which WidgetStorage.com will accept coupons from Widgets.com in exchange for traffic. Widgets.com could issue JWS giving Bob a 10% discount on the WidgetStorage.com site. Again, because the data is signed, WidgetStorage can know that Widgets.com emitted this. If the data was not signed, then Bob could change his discount to 50% and no one could know just from looking at the data.  Limitations  JWS is one of the standards in the JOSE series and is meant to be used in combination with them. For example, for encryption JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is supposed to be used in conjunction. As of 2015, JWS was a proposed standard, and was part of several other IETF draft standards, and there was code available on the web to implement the draft standard.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is located in the Sriperumbudur - Singaperumalkoil road. The temple has a gateway leading to a pillared hall and the sanctum. The temple is open from 6:30 am ‚Äì 12:00 pm and 5 - 8:30 pm. Five daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Adi Pooram festival being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend A peacock in the temple enclosure As per Hindu legend, there was a demon by name Vallan who was troubling the Devas, the celestial deities. The Devas sought the help of Murugan. He informed them that the time had come to destroy the demon. He eventually waged a war and slayed the demon at the place. He established the place as Vallan Kottai, literally meaning the \\"Fort of Vallan\\". Indra, the king of Devas, requested his Guru Brihaspathi to suggest a place for him to worship Murugan. He suggested going to Vallakottai, an abode of Murugan. Indra came to Vallakottai, pierced the earth with his weapon Vajrayudha to create a tank to extract water. He performed ablution to image of Murugan at this place and attained his needs. Since Indra created the tank with his Vajrayudha, the temple tank is named as Vajra Theertha. As per another legend, a king by name Bhagiratha was ruling the Elanji kingdom. He was very haughty to sage Naratha and to teach him a lesson for his behaviour, Naratha infuriated a demon king named Goran to attack Elanji kingdom. Goran was a powerful demon and he made a sudden attack. Bhagiratha was unable to control the forces and eventually lost the battle to Goran. Realising his mistake, he sought the advise of Naratha. The sage advised him to find sage Durvasa, who could find a resolution. The king roamed around the forest for a long time and finally found Durvasa. The sage advised him to worship Murugan at Vallakottai to get back his kingdom. The king worshipped Murugan at this place for a long time and built the temple. Architecture As per the hagographical records from the region, the temple is believed to have been built during the 9th century. The temple is located in Vallakottai, in Kanchipuram district in Tamil Nadu on the road from Sriperumbudur to Singaperumalkoil .

Religious significance Vallakottai temple is revered in Thirupugazh composed by Arunagirinathar, a 15th-century saint. The temple is revered in eight verses by the saint. As per a legend, the saint worshipped Murugan at Thiruporur temple and was on his way to Thiruthani Murugan Temple. During his sleep, a divine voice directed him to go to Vallakottai temple. He woke up to realise it was the order of Murugan and he visited the temple. The temple is considered equal in importance to the Arupadaiveedu, the six abodes of Murugan. Festival and religious practises Kodai Andavar temple tank The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed five times a day: Gho Pooja at 6:30 a.m., Kalasandhi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikala poojai at 8:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Arthajama Pooja at 8:15 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for the presiding deities. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6:30 am ‚Äì 12:00 pm and 5‚Äì8:30 pm on all days except during festive occasions when it has extended timings.

The Million Mask March, also known as \\"Operation Vendetta\\", is a worldwide, annual protest associated with the hacktivist group Anonymous occurring annually on Guy Fawkes Day, 5 November. The motive for the March varies, but includes some consistent themes prevalent in the Anonymous movement, including: corruption in politics, demilitarization, police violence, and self-governance. The marches are set in motion to allow ordinary citizens to collaborate in order to create societal change through alterations to their governments. They are coordinated through a host of channels with most prevalent being word of mouth and social media. Hundreds of Facebook events and dedicated Twitter accounts are used to advertise the protest around the world. History Anonymous, originally a group of internet forum users, first came into political activism from its battle against Scientology, referred to as Project Chanology. This culminated in a worldwide protest outside of Scientology churches across the globe. The first Million Mask March occurred in 2012; the largest events occurred in London and Washington, DC, with smaller scale events across the globe, usually outside of government buildings.

Mindfulness stems from Buddhist meditation practices and refers to the awareness that arises through paying attention on purpose in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.

The excessive use of personal devices, such as smartphones and laptops, can lead to the deterioration of mental and physical health. This area focuses on redesigning and creating technology to improve the wellbeing of its users.  Mindfulness theory  In 1979 Jon Kabat-Zinn founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program at the University of Massachusetts to treat the chronically ill. He is noted to be responsible for the popularization of mindfulness in Western culture. The program uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and yoga. These practices derived from teachings of the Eastern World, specifically Buddhist traditions. Researchers found that enhanced mindfulness through the program partly mediated the association between increased daily spiritual experiences and improved mental-health-related quality of life. Early studies of mindfulness focused on health issues related to psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders, while later studies of mindfulness explore the business sector, showing an increase in creativity and a decrease in burnout. Studies on the relationship between mindfulness and technology are fairly new, with some of the more recent research highlighting the importance the practice plays in safety. Technology=Software There are applications for desktop and mobile to help users bring themselves back to the present moment. One of these mobile apps has been shown through a randomized controlled trial to help alleviate acute stress, while improving mood; and may provide long- term benefits on attentional control. =Mindfulness Bell= According to Vietnamese Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh, the ringing of a bell every 15 minutes is an effective way to cultivate the mindfulness practice and connect back with the body. The Mindfulness Bell and Mindful Mynah applications simulate the bell on the user's personal device. =Meditation= A 2011 brain imaging study published in the Journal of Neuroscience found that even very brief instruction in mindfulness meditation (four 20-minute sessions) was effective in relieving pain by reducing the brain's emotional response to painful stimuli. To help make meditation and mindfulness more accessible, developers have created digital health platforms, such as Am Mindfulness, Headspace, Insight Timer and Buddhify. Currently, Am Mindfulness is the only commercially available meditation app that has outperformed placebo in randomized controlled trials. Wearables There are several wearables which measures the breath in order to connect the user back to their body. Wo.Defy is a dress which attempts to reveal the beauty of emotional communication using the common platform of the human breath; proposing the best methods of human to human communication lie within us. Spire measures your breathing patterns to give you insights into your state of mind. Being, the mindfulness tracker from Zensorium, maps user's emotions (stressed, excited normal and calm) through heart rate variability. WellBe monitors heart rate levels and then matches them, through a patent pending algorithm, to specific moments and interactions throughout a user's day. SmartMat is a responsive mat embedded with 21,000 sensors to detect your body's balance, pressure and alignment. Prana's platform evaluates breath patterns, takes into account the effects of posture on breathing, and differentiates between diaphragmatic and chest breathing, three critical components of assessing the true quality of breathing, previously unaddressed by systems such as spirometers or pulse oximeters. Virtual Reality Sonic Cradle enables users to shape sound with their breath while suspended in a completely dark chamber.Jay Vidyarthi and Bernhard E. Riecke. 2013.

The researchers conducted a qualitative study with 39 participants to show how persuasive media have the potential to promote long-term psychological health by experientially introducing a stress-relieving, contemplative practice to non-practitioners. Because the nature of chronic pain is complex, pharmacological analgesics are often not enough to achieve an ideal treatment plan. The system incorporates biofeedback sensors, an immersive virtual environment, and stereoscopic sound titled the \\"Virtual Meditative Walk\\" (VMW). It was designed to enable chronic pain patients to learn Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a form of meditation. By providing real-time visual and sonic feedback, VMW enables patients to learn how to manage their pain.Diane Gromala, Xin Tong, Amber Choo, Mehdi Karamnejad, and Chris D. Shaw. 2015.

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 521-524. Techno-spirituality Intel anthropologist Genevieve Bell has urged the human-computer interaction (HCI) research community to devote more research to the use of technology in spirituality and religion. Techno- spirituality is the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness. Currently, there are 6,000 applications related to spirituality and religion. This area is in high demand and ‚Äúimportant under-explored areas of HCI research‚Äù. Inspired by Bell's work, researchers (Sterling & Zimmerman) focused on how mobile phones could be incorporated in American Soto Zen Buddhist community, without conflicting with their philosophy of ‚Äúthe here and the now‚Äù. They were able to find three ways to use technology to help strengthen ties within the community. Interaction Design=Slow Design Slow design is a design agenda for technology aimed at reflection and moments of mental rest rather than efficiency in performance. Mindful Design Mindful design, based on Langer‚Äôs theory of mindfulness, is a design philosophy that incorporates the idea of mindfulness into creating meaningful user oriented design. A major tenant is the behavior change of a user through awareness and responsibility of meaningful interactions between user and designed object, and this will encourage more desirable human practices. This type of mind behavior driven change has been most heavily incorporated design for sustainability. Other approaches include crime prevention or health. It is also seen in the design of safety objects and the social interaction of performative objects. Performative objects are identified as design objects that are designed to facilitate mindful awareness of the physical and symbolic social actions and their consequences within which they are used. Mindfulness and Silicon Valley  Classes in mindfulness practices have become part of some of Silicon Valleys major tech giants. Google has implemented a series of bimonthly \\"mindfulness lunches\\" as well as built a labyrinth for walking meditations. Both Twitter and Facebook have incorporated contemplative practices into their corporate culture. The desired outcome of using mindfulness in the tech workforce is to increase communication and develop the emotional intelligence of their employees. Internet Addiction and Mindfulness Mindfulness is currently being explored by researchers as a possible treatment for technological addiction, also known as Internet addiction disorder, a form of behavioral addiction. There has been some consensus in the field of psychology on the benefits of using mindfulness to treat behavioral addiction. Experts in the field say in order to treat technology addiction with mindfulness, one must be non-judgmental about the behavior and pay attention in order to recognize instances in which technology is being used mindlessly. Then reflect on the helpfulness of the device, and notice the benefits of disconnecting. The three keystones of mindfulness are: Intention, Attention and Action. Technology is said to interfere with mindfulness by causing the individual to forget what matters (intention), the distracts (attention), and then keeps the individual from taking action. In technological addiction, the reward system, located in the mid-brain and underlies addiction, evolved to rewards finding and consuming food. In complex animals this evolution also rewards the exchange of information within the social group. In humans this has developed into its current form of mass worldwide communication. The exchange of social information has demonstrated reward based reinforcement, similar to that of gamification.  Criticisms  Critics of the mindfulness movement in technology focus on several key areas, technophobia, pacifications of genuine grievances in the workforce and disconnection from religious roots. The editor of the New Republic, Eygeny Morozov, questions the value of tech companies who advocate \\"unplugging\\" from the modern digital lifestyle as similar to a drug addict taking a tolerance break from the substance they are addicted to in order to then increase the vigor with which those activities are then resumed (3, 4). They also state that the concept of Mindfulness in the tech world is jargonistic and amorphous.  Mobile  Mobile meditation applications like Calm, Headspace, and MyLife have over a million users and are increasing in popularity. Swedish Researchers found that downloading and using the applications for eight weeks made little to no difference for people with major depression and anxiety. They did, however, see improvements with a subgroup with mild levels of depression. Disconnectionists Criticisms of the slow technology movement are similar to the slow-food movement; it lacks understanding of global scope, and as an individualistic response will not answer the actual problems in technology. This movement has been dubbed by critics as disconnectionists. Mindfulness in technology has been criticized as being less about restoring self and more about stifling autonomy that technology inspires. Anti- disconnectionists state mindfulness and the expressed need to disconnect from technology and the modern world can be accused of being a nostalgia- manipulating marketing tactic and maybe a technological form of conservatism. Critics state that the labeling of digital connection as debasing and unnatural is in direct proportion to the rapidity of adoption. Thus it is depicted as a dangerous desire and toxin to be regulated. This argument itself can be tied back to rationalization, Walter Benjamin on aura, Jacques Ellul on technique, Jean Baudrillard on simulations, or Zygmunt Bauman and the Frankfurt School on modernity and the Enlightenment. Critics state that disconnectionists see the Internet as having normalized or enforced a repression of an authentic self in favor of a social media avatar. Thus reflecting the desire to connect with a deeper self, which may itself be an illusion. The pathologization of technology use then opens the door for Foucault's idea of \\"normalization\\" to be applied to technology in similar fashion as other social ills, which then can become a concept around which social control and management can be applied. Buddhist concerns There is some concern among Buddhist practitioners that decoupling meditation and mindfulness from the core tenement of Buddhism may have negative effects. The wide adoption of mindfulness in technology and the tech industry has been accused of increasing passivity in the worker by creating a calm mindstate which then allows for disconnection from actual grievances. Critics of mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy also comment on this as a possible problem. However, critics of the movement fear that the secularization of mindfulness, dubbed McMindfulness, leads to reinforcement of anti-Buddhist ideas. Buddhists differentiate between Right Mindfulness (samma sati) and Wrong Mindfulness (miccha sati). The distinction is not moralistic: the issue is whether the quality of awareness is characterized by wholesome intentions and positive mental qualities that lead to human flourishing and optimal well- being for others as well as oneself. Mindfulness as adopted by the Silicon Valley tech giants has been criticized as conveniently shifting the burden of stress and toxic work environment onto the individual employee. Obfuscated by the seemingly inherent qualities of care and humanity, mindfulness is refashioned into a way of coping with and adapting to the stresses and strains of corporate life rather than actually solving them.

The segment begins with two animated flag-colored donkeys saying a one-line summary of a Democratic policy position (like \\"equal pay\\"). *Don and the Giant Impeach Stephen covers the impeachment of Donald Trump. The segment begins with Trump saying a one-line summary of his position (like \\"witch hunt\\") as he runs away from a giant peach, parodying James and the Giant Peach. *Fury Road to the White House 2020 Updates on the 2020 United States presidential election. The name and intro are a parody of Mad Max: Fury Road. *Goin' Viral Updates on the COVID-19 pandemic. The segment begins with a coronavirus saying a one-line summary of how to catch it (like \\"up top\\"). *The Hungry for Power Games In a parody of The Hunger Games, Colbert dresses up as a version of Caesar Flickerman and mocks a candidate that has dropped out of the race from the 2016 United States Presidential Election.\\"The Hungry For Power Games\\", YouTube The sketch has occasionally been reprised as \\"The Hungry To Leave Power Games\\", mocking departing members of the Trump administration such as Rex Tillerson and Scott Pruitt. *The Late Show Figure-It-Out-a-Tron In a parody of Glenn Beck's use of chalkboards, Colbert brings out a chalkboard with names of people implicated in an ongoing scandal written all over it. He then tries to figure out the links between these people by drawing lines connecting their names. These lines form a humorous and often crude drawing related to the scandal, such as a penis or swastika. *Midnight Confessions Colbert examines his conscience to his audience. He starts with a disclaimer that while the things that he confesses are not technically sins, he still feels guilty about them. *Piano 1-0-Fun! with Jon Batiste Jon Batiste hosts absurd instructional videos. *Real News Tonight A parody of television newscasts, hosted by \\"Jim Anchorton\\" (John Thibodeaux) and \\"Jill Newslady\\" (Jen Spyra), that consists entirely of overly- positive fake stories designed to praise Donald Trump. In 2017, when Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump began producing Real News Update videos that similarly presented positive coverage of Trump, Colbert presented an edition of Real News Tonight that featured her as a \\"special correspondent\\"‚Äîusing clips of Real News Update to make it look like she was interacting with the show's existing \\"anchors\\". On June 18, 2019, the Jill and Jim characters attended a launch event for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign at the Amway Center in Orlando, interviewing supporters for a segment that aired on the June 20, 2019 episode. Their press credentials had been revoked at the last minute, but they still managed to make it inside the event by registering online (also exposing exaggerated claims surrounding the attendance of the rally). *Stephen Talks with God Colbert talks with God, as portrayed as an animated character projected on the ceiling of the Ed Sullivan Theater. *WERD Colbert chooses a word or phrase as a theme for a rant on a topical subject or news item while humorous captions displayed in a sidebar either highlight or sarcastically undercut what he is saying. The segment is based on \\"The W√∏rd\\", a segment Colbert performed throughout the entire run of The Colbert Report. Colbert introduced The W√∏rd segment on The Late Show on July 18, 2016. During the July 27, 2016 episode, Colbert indirectly stated Comedy Central had objected to his use of elements from the Report on Late Show; subsequently, the segment has been done under the name \\"WERD\\". *Wheel of News Colbert spins a wheel with random topics of news to talk about. Based on Wheel of Fortune.  Recurring sketches with guests =Big Questions with Even Bigger Stars Colbert and a guest sit under the stars and have absurd conversations about topics.

Construction started in 1924 and the building was dedicated in 1925. It was the first dedicated gymnasium on the KSU campus, which had opened in 1913. Before the opening of Wills Gym, physical education classes and the intercollegiate and intramural sports teams used a variety of spaces for games and classes, both on campus in other buildings and off campus. The main gym seated approximately 4,000 people and the basement level included an indoor pool, locker rooms, and bowling alley. At the time, its capacity made it one of the largest facilities in the region. The building served as the primary home of the university's athletic teams and physical education department until 1950, when the Men's Physical Education Building opened. Wills Gym was the first permanent home of the Kent State Golden Flashes men's basketball team, and was also the original home venue for wrestling, men's swimming, men's and women's gymnastics, women's volleyball, and women's basketball. Even after being replaced as the primary athletic venue and physical education facility, Wills Gym continued to be used as the home venue for men's gymnastics, later joined by women's gymnastics in 1959, and women's volleyball and basketball in 1975. It was also used for women's physical education, intramural sports, class registration, and other activities for nearly 30 years. By the 1970s, structural and maintenance issues along with the passage and implementation of Title IX resulted in plans to build a replacement for Wills. Women's basketball and volleyball left Wills after their respective 1977 seasons and moved to Memorial Gym, while both gymnastics teams played part of their home schedules at Wills until 1979. The building was condemned by the state of Ohio in the mid 1970s. Physical education classes and offices were moved to the new Memorial Gym Annex, completed in mid-1979. In August 1979, the gymnasium and pool were razed, though the portion of the building which had housed the physical education offices remained as Wills Hall and housed the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program from 1983‚Äì2000. A parking lot was built on the site of the gym and pool. In the early 2000s, Wills Hall was torn down and replaced with a lobby area as part of the renovation of the adjacent University Auditorium, which was renamed Cartwright Hall in 2006. History Interior of the playing floor in 1934 showing windows and skylight A gymnasium was part of the original plans for the Kent State Normal School and plans were presented to the Ohio State Legislature in 1916 for its construction along with a heating plant and additional dormitory. The allocation of funds for the gym, however, was not approved until 1923 due to World War I. In the meantime, physical education, intramural, and intercollegiate sports used a variety of other spaces. Early basketball games were held in various locations, such as the atrium of the original Administration Building (known as Cartwright Hall since 2006), in the basement of the original heating plant, in the local Congregational Church gymnasium, and at Theodore Roosevelt High School. The site chosen for the gym was a swampy area known as Blackbird Lake, located directly behind the original Administration Building, which had been completed in 1914. Construction started on Wills Gym in 1924 and it was dedicated May 16, 1925. Initially, it was simply called \\"the Gymnasium\\" before being named for David C. Wills, who was chairman of the Kent State Board of Trustees at the time. Built as an annex to the Administration Building, the facility featured the main gymnasium, which had a balcony with seating for 650 people and an overall capacity of approximately 4,000. In the basement were shower areas, a six-lane swimming pool, and a six-lane bowling alley. Offices for the new Physical Education Department‚Äîwhich had been mandated by the state of Ohio a year earlier‚Äîand Intercollegiate Athletics were located on the first floor. Wills Gym was hailed as \\"one of finest gymnasiums in Ohio\\" by the school's 1927 yearbook, The Chestnut Burr, adding that teams who traveled to Kent for basketball or football games always wanted to see the gym. The first men's basketball game at Wills Gym was a 37‚Äì24 loss to Mount Union College on January 5, 1926 to open the 1925‚Äì26 season. A varsity wrestling team began play in 1928, followed by men's gymnastics in 1930, and men's swimming in 1936. The gym was also a frequent site for high school games and tournaments, and served as the home court for the Kent State High School Blue Devils until 1956. Following World War II, a large increase in the number of male students led to the expansion of the school, and of the athletic and physical education departments in particular, which included construction of a new Men's Physical Education Building. The new gym was completed in 1950 with seating for 7,000 and could hold as many as 10,000. It replaced Wills Gym as the home of men's physical education and as the venue for the men's basketball, swimming, and wrestling teams. The final men's basketball game at Wills was a 68‚Äì47 win over the Western Reserve Red Cats on March 7, 1950. Men's gymnastics continued to use Wills Gymnasium as their home venue and were joined by the women's gymnastics team in 1959, the first women's collegiate gymnastics team in the United States. The 1972 passage of Title IX led to the establishment of intercollegiate women's volleyball and women's basketball teams in 1975, with home games at Wills Gym. In addition to equal playing opportunities for female athletes, however, Title IX also required equal facilities for both men and women and the facilities at Wills were not only older and in deteriorating condition, but were considerably smaller than those at the Memorial Gym as the seating capacity at Wills Gym had been reduced to near 100 by the mid 1970s. Both women's teams initially played all or most of their schedule at Wills for their first few seasons before permanently moving to Memorial Gym for the 1977‚Äì78 seasons. The men's and women's gymnastics teams continued to have home meets at both Memorial and Wills through the 1979 season. The final gymnastics meet at Wills was the women's team's 150th win all-time. In early 1970, most of the seats in the balcony were removed and the area was used to create classroom and office space. In the following years, structural and maintenance problems were evident and frequent, which may have been caused by the original swampy site. The building was closed and declared \\"unsafe\\" in March 1973, and while repairs were made to allow continued use of the gym, the building was not fully renovated. In late June 1979, just prior to the closure of the building, a large section of ceiling plaster above the pool collapsed. Offices and activities began moving to the new Memorial Gym Annex (now known as the MACC Annex) in mid July 1979 and demolition on Wills Gym began in early August 1979. The former offices of the physical education department remained after the demolition, known as Wills Hall, and served as the home of the Kent State chapter of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) from 1983‚Äì2000. Wills Hall was razed in 2000 as part of a renovation and expansion to adjacent Cartwright Hall, then known as the Auditorium Building. Other uses In addition to physical education and intercollegiate and intramural athletics, Wills Gym hosted class registration for many years, and was also used for dances and other large social events, such as those related to homecoming. In 1940, Wills Gym was the site of the final game of the National Basketball League championship, between the Akron Firestone Non-Skids and Oshkosh All- Stars, won by Firestone 61‚Äì60. The game was moved to Kent from the Firestone gym in Akron because Wills Gym had a larger seating capacity than other facilities in the area at the time. During the 1940s, Wills was used for a high school basketball tournament featuring the rural schools of Portage County. The gym was also a regular site for Ohio high school sectional and district tournament games for both size classifications at the time, Class A and Class B, with some Class A games drawing capacity crowds in excess of 4,000 people. Architecture Interior view in 1930 during a physical education class. Balcony seats, windows, and lower-level bleacher seating can be seen in the background. The exterior facade of Wills Gym was brick with embedded columns and rectangular windows, similar to the adjacent Cartwright, Kent, and Merrill Halls, all of which were designed in the Neoclassical style, prominent in the early 20th century. Total space was with listed as \\"assignable space\\". The interior was divided into three levels, with two levels above ground and the lower level just below ground. The main gymnasium occupied most of the upper two levels on one side. It featured large windows on three sides, and originally had a large skylight in the center over the gym floor. Three double doorways were located on the sideline opposite the balcony, which led to short staircases with access to the parking lot. On the fourth side on the upper level was the balcony section, which had fixed chairback seating and smaller windows on all three exterior walls near the ceiling. In 1970, the seating and tiers in the balcony were removed and the area was largely converted into additional classroom space. The remainder of the seating in the gym was provided by bleacher seats, which were located around the playing floor. On the ground floor under the balcony section were offices and storage areas, including a mail room. For a time, the campus police department also and an office in Wills Gym. A corridor in the center of the level connected Wills Gym with the adjacent University Auditorium in what is now known as Cartwright Hall. The lower level mainly contained the pool and locker rooms, as well as the power and heating utilities rooms. When the building was dedicated in 1925, much of the basement was still unfinished. Originally, the lower level was a larger open space and also included a seating area adjacent to the pool and bowling alleys. The level was later subdivided into smaller rooms. There were windows on three sides of the basement level, but because it was mostly below ground, they were smaller and higher on the walls. Site Cartwright Hall in the center background The area formerly occupied by Wills Gymnasium is mostly covered by a parking lot behind Cartwright Hall, which houses the 800-seat University Auditorium. The main lobby for the auditorium, built in 2002, is where Wills Hall stood and overlaps the northern end of Wills Gymnasium, over the part of the building that housed the physical education offices.

A VIC-20 port by Gary York was released in 1983, and an Apple II version by Patrick Buckland the same year. The Atari version was re-released in 1985 on cassette as part of the Sparker brand of low-cost games. A version for the TI-99/4 was announced but was not released until 1986 when a third party bought the rights. Submarine Commander simulates the operations of a German U-boat during World War II. The action takes place in the Mediterranean Sea, where the player has to track down a number of allied convoys and then approach them underwater to attack with their torpedoes. Submarine Commander plays in real time: the actions of the player and those of the enemy convoys occur simultaneously. Gameplay View from the periscope as the submarine lines up for a shot on a cargo ship. The game opens displaying the control console, whose square middle section shows a map of the Mediterranean with your current location displayed as a white cross and the locations of enemy ships as black dots. Various status details are shown in the two rectangular areas on either side of the map. Forward movement is controlled by the number keys, 1 for slow and 9 for maximum. On the surface the submarine moves more rapidly and recharges its batteries and air supply. The joystick provide directional control through the rudders and dive planes. This is a slow process, turning the ship right around in a 360 degree circle takes considerable time even at full speed. The main display in the center can be switched between three modes, the map, a sonar display, and the periscope. Typically a mission proceeds by starting on the map display while surfaced, and chasing down one of the convoys. When one is sighted, announced by a bonging sound, the player dives the submarine to attack depth and continues the approach using the sonar display. Once the range has closed, they raise the periscope and attack the ships with the torpedoes. The periscope shows ships if they are within one mile and the submarine is above 50 feet depth. There are four types of ships in the convoys; oil tankers, cargo ships, destroyers and patrol boats. All of the ships are armed with at least one gun, and will fire on a surfaced submarine. If the submarine is underwater, the destroyers and patrol boats will attack, while the tankers and cargo ships attempt to flee. Successful attacks cause damage to the ship, which repairs slowly over time. The game ends when the air runs out, the hull reaches damage level 9, there are no torpedoes or fuel left, or all the convoys have been destroyed. The game then assigns a score based on various factors. The game features nine difficulty levels, which change the number and makeup of the convoys, along with consumables. At the lowest level there are five convoys and the player has 80 torpedoes, 250 fuel and battery that holds a charge of 70. At the highest level, 9, there are 9 convoys, 40 torpedoes, 140 fuel and a battery that can be charged to 30. In levels 7 through 9, more than one torpedo may be needed to sink a ship. Reception Electronic Fun gave it a rare 4 out of 4 rating, noting that in spite of the complexity the game was still very fun, and that \\"Whenever you hit an enemy ship, you want to jump up and cheer.\\" Hosea Battles reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"This game will appeal to those who like arcade graphics and sounds, but enjoy a sense of wargaming.\\" Antic awarded it a spot in its 10 best games in 1982 list, calling it \\"an extremely sophisticated simulation with the added fun of gaming excitement.\\" The Hi-Res review was extremely favourable, saying \\"There is no question about Submarine Commander. It is the underwater Star Raiders!\\". The game was mentioned in a New Scientist article covering Thorn's entry into the videogame market, and a similar article in Billboard. The Sparkler edition re- release was reviewed in 1986 by Computer Gamer, who gave it a \\"Red Giant\\" rating on their star scale, a rating shared that month by the classic Rescue on Fractalus. The long-delayed release on the TI-99 gained a A rating. Legacy A 1993 Computer Gaming World survey of wargames gave Submarine Commander one star out of five, describing it as \\"innovative in its time, but now offers next to nothing for the simulation gamer\\". A 2009 review noted that \\"Submarine Commander has brought to the video gaming industry what Eastern Front 1941 done; that is making the computer to be separate medium to those traditional board games. Yet Submarine Commander added an extra flavour of being immersed in 3D which is a dramatic step in contrast to those many, many side-scrolling shoot-em up games.\\" Another reviewer noted it is \\"one of the most complex games produced for the VIC-20.\\" TI-99 version After Thorn announced the TI version, TI reseller Howard Greenberg placed a large order for this and other Thorn games. However, Thorn began rapidly shuffling management, and then left the video game industry entirely. Some of the former Thorn employees then went on to form Creative Sparks, and had the rights to the Thorn titles. By this time, Texas Instruments had announced and then rapidly exited the home computer field. Greenberg persisted in trying to get the games, and was ultimately able to arrange to buy the rights and receive one cartridge for each of the three announced TI games, River Rescue, Computer War (WarGames), and Submarine Commander. He then flew to the US to have the code extracted from the cartridges with the help of Tenex Computer Express. Tenex then printed a run of cartridges, while Greenberg sold them in the UK in diskette form starting in December 1986.

It also acts in the reverse direction, metabolizing 5-oxo-ETE to 5(S)-HETE. Since 5-oxo-ETE is 30-100-fold more potent than 5(S)-HETE in stimulating various cell types, 5-HEDH is regarded as a regulator and promoter of 5(S)HETE's and thereby 5-LOX's influences on cell function. Although 5-HEDH has been evaluated in a wide range of intact cells and in crude microsome preparations, it has not yet been evaluated for its structure, for its gene, of in pure form; furthermore, most studies on it have been conducted in human tissues.  5-HEDH Substrates  The substrate specificity of 5-HEDH has been evaluated in a variety of intact cells and in crude microsome preparations isolated from cultured human blood monocytes differentiated into macrophages. These studies indicate that the enzyme efficiently oxidizes long chain unsaturated fatty acids possessing a hydroxy residue at carbon 5 and a trans double bound at carbon 6 to their corresponding 5-oxo products. It is therefore most efficient in metabolizing 5(S)-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE and, with somewhat lesser efficiency, in metabolizing other 5(S)-hydroxyl-6-trans unsaturated fatty acids such as 5(S)-hydroxy- eicosapentaenoic acid, 5(S)-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid, 5(S)-hydroxy- eicosadeinoic acid, 5(S)-hydroxy-eicosamonoenoic acid, 5(S)-hydroxy- octadecadienoic acid, 5(S),15(S)-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and the 6-trans isomer of leukotriene B4 (which is a 5(S),12(S)-dihydroxyeicosatetraeonic acid) to their corresponding oxo analogs. 5-HEDH has relatively little ability to oxidize 5(S)-hydroxyl-tetradecadienoic acid, the R stereoisomer of 5(S)-HETE (5(R)-HETE), or a racemic mixture of 8-HETE, and does not oxidize 12(S)-HETE, 15(S)-HETE, leukotriene B4, a racemate mixture of 9-HETE, a racemate mixture of 11-HETE, or a 5(S)-hydroxy-6-trans 12 carbon dienoic fatty acid.J Biol Chem. 1992 Sep 25;267(27):19233-41Prog Lipid Res. 2005 Mar-May;44(2-3):154-83J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2009 Apr;329(1):335-41. 5-HEDH is therefore hydroxy dehydrogenase that acts in a stereospecific manner to oxidize 5(S)-hydoxy residues in 6-trans unsaturated intermediate but not short-chain fatty acids.  5-HEDH enzymology  5-HEDH is an NADPH dehydrogenase oxidoreductase enzyme. It transfers a hydrogen cation or Hydron (chemistry) (H+) from 5(S)-hydroxy (i.e. 5(S-OH) residues of its fatty acid targets to Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to form 5-oxo (i.e. 5-O=) counterparts of its targets plus reduced NADP+, i.e. NADPH. The reaction (where R indicates a long chain [14 or more carbons] fatty acid) is: ::::::::::::::;;:::::NADP+ \\\\+ 5(S)-hydroxy fatty acid (i.e. 5(S)-OH-R) \\\\rightleftharpoons NADPH + H+ \\\\+ oxo fatty acid (i.e. 5-O=R) The reaction appears to follow a ping-pong mechanism. It is fully reversible, readily converting 5-oxo targets to their corresponding 5(S)-hydroxy counterparts. The direction of this reaction is dependent on the level of NADP+ relative to that of NADPH: a) cells bearing high NADP+/NADPH ratios convert 5-hydroxy fatty acids which they make or are presented with to 5(S) fatty acids; b) cells bearing low NADP+/NADPH ratios convert little or none of the 5-hydroxy fatty acids which they make or are presented with to 5-oxo fatty acids and rapidly reduce the 5-oxo fatty acids which they are presented with to the corresponding 5(S)-hydroxy fatty acids.Prog Lipid Res. 2005 Mar-May;44(2-3):154-83.

Review  Alternate 5-oxo-ETE producing pathways  The immediate metabolic precursor to 5(S)-HETE, 5(S)-hydroperoxy-6S,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid 5(S)-HpETE, can be converted to 5-oxo-ETE in a non-enzymatic dehydration reaction or chemical lipid peroxidation reactions.Prog Lipid Res. 2005 Mar-May;44(2-3):154-83. Epub 2005 Apr 20. Review The physiological occurrence and relevancy of these reaction pathways has not been ascertained.  5-HEDH cellular distribution  Since 5-HEDH has not been defined biochemically or genetically, studies on its distribution have been limited to examining the ability of cells or cell microsomes to make 5-oxo-ETE from 5(S)-HETE. A wide variety of cell types possess this activity including blood neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, B lymphocytes, and platelets; airway epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells, and monocytes differentiated in vitro to dendritic cells; and cancer cell lines derived from many of these cells or from prostate, breast, and colon cancer cells.

Review  Regulation of 5-HEDH activity  Cells typically maintain low NADP+/NADPH ratios by rapidly reducing NADP+ to NADPH using glutathione reductase in a cyclical NADPH replenishing reaction. These cells rapidly reduce ambient 5-oxo-ETE to 5(S)-HETE. However, cells suffering oxidative stress generate excesses in toxic reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (). Cells use glutathione peroxidase to detoxify this by converting it to H2O in a reaction that consumes glutathione by converting it to glutathione disulfide; the cells then metabolize glutathione disulfide back to glutathione in a glutathione reductase-dependent reaction that converts NADPH to NADP+. While cells suffering oxidative stress can replenish NADPH by reducing NADP+ through the Pentose phosphate pathway, they often develop very high NADP+/NADPH ratios and therefore preferentially convert 5-(S)-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE.Prog Lipid Res. 2005 Mar-May;44(2-3):154-83. Epub 2005 Apr 20. Review. Cells that function as phagocytes have a second pathway that dramatically raises NADP+/NADPH ratios. Neutrophils and macrophages, for example, after phagocytosing bacteria or otherwise strongly stimulated to activate their respiratory burst generate reactive oxygen species including by activating NADPH. The latter cell types have particularly high levels of 5-HEDH and therefore are particularly important producers of 5-oxo-ETE when so stimulated.Prog Lipid Res. 2005 Mar-May;44(2-3):154-83.

The death of neutrophils and tumor cells also strongly promotes the oxidation of 5-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE, probably as a result of associated oxidative stress.Biochim Biophys Acta. 2015 Apr;1851(4):340-55. Epub 2014 Oct 29.>  Function of 5-HEDH  5-HEDH functions as a highly specific oxidizer of 5(S)-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE; no functional importance has yet been ascribed to its ability in similarly oxidizing other 5(S)-hydroxyl fatty acids. 5-Oxo-ETE stimulates a wide range of biological activities far more potently and powerfully than 5(S)-HETE (see 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid and 5-HETE). For example, it is 30-100-fold more potent in stimulating cells that promote inflammation and allergy reactions such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, and basophils and is more potent than 5-HETE in stimulating various types of cancer cells to grow. Furthermore, 5-oxo-ETE appears to be involved in various animal and human reactions: injected into the skin of rabbits, it causes a severe edema with an inflammatory cell infiltrate resembling an urticaria-like lesion;Int J Mol Med. 1998 Aug;2(2):149-153 it is present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from cats undergoing experimentally induced asthma;Biochem Pharmacol. 2015 Aug 1;96(3):247-55. . it stimulates the local accumulation of eosinophils, neutrophils, and monocytes when injected into the skin of humans;J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2003 Oct;112(4):768-74 and it has been extracted from scales of psoriatic patients.Int J Mol Med. 1998 Aug;2(2):149-153 Most if not all of these allergic and inflammatory conditions as well as rapidly growing cancerous lesions are associated with oxidative stress.Prog Lipid Res. 2013 Oct;52(4):651-65. .

Review It also possible that the cells involved in these pathological states favor the reversed action of 5-HEDH, conversion of 5-oxo-ETE to 5(S)-HETE, as a consequence of reductions in oxidative stress and thereby NADP+/NADPH ratios; such cells might then actually \\"detoxify\\" 5-oxo-ETE and contribute to resolving the pathological states.

It dates from his so-called Blue period and is noted for its caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Ma√±ach painted on the reverse. It was offered for sale ex the William I. Koch collection at a Sotheby's, New York, auction on 5 November 2015. The painting realized $67.5 million at the sale, a record for a Blue period Picasso and placing the painting among the most expensive ever sold. Gommeuse was sexually charged slang of the time for caf√©- concert singers and their songs.  Background  The painting was executed in the second half of 1901 following Picasso's successful exhibition at the Vollard gallery that June. This was at the start of his Blue period of 1901 to 1904, thought to have been occasioned by the suicide of his friend Carlos Casagemas earlier in the year, a time when his paintings were somewhat melancholic and characterized by somber monochromatic tones in blue and green. The caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Ma√±ach on the reverse is inscribed \\"Recuerdo a Ma√±ach en el d√≠a de su santo\\", demonstrating the painting was intended as a gift for Ma√±ach on his Saint's Day (29 June). Ma√±ach was a Catalan anarchist who shared Picasso's studio flat in the Boulevard de Clichy. He worked as a talent scout for art dealers and was responsible for organising Picasso's successful 1901 Vollard show. A portrait of Ma√±ach, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, was a feature of the show.

It replaced the Negro Republican Party faction's name after the 1890s. Southern Republicans were divided into two factions: the lily-white faction, which was practically all-white, and the biracial black-and-tan faction. The former was strongest in heavily white counties.\\"Black and Tan Republicans\\" in Andrew Cunningham McLaughlin and Albert Bushnell Hart, eds. Cyclopedia of American Government (1914) . p. 133. online The final victory of its opponent the lily-white faction came in 1964. History The black-and-tan faction was biracial. It sought to include most African-American voters within the party. They often took a prominent part in the national conventions of the Republican party. One reason for the continuance of the black-and-tan faction was its effect in holding the African-American Republican vote in northern states. The black- and-tans predominated in counties with a large black population, the whites in these counties being usually Democrats. The lily-whites were mostly found in the counties where fewer blacks lived. The factionalism flared up in 1928 and 1952. The surviving Black-and-tan factions lost heavily in 1964 with the nomination of Barry Goldwater for President and practically disappeared.
